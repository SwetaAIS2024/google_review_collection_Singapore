In the sauce‚Ä¶.. luckily i was chewing properly and felt something weird‚Ä¶ reached into my mouth and to my horror, out came a piece of plastic from my mouth.. and it was quite a long piece! Imagine a kid or an elderly eating this burger?? They could have choked on it! This is so dangerous! This is very unacceptable. Higher management should be more vigilant and keep this kind of BASIC food safety in place!",

Total price $21.00, higher then my expectations.\n\nOverall the taste of the beefs is well cook & tender, my wife didn‚Äôt like the sea food combination, she said a little salty.\n\nPotato fried is good & tasty, sweet potato fried also very good taste.\n\nOverall just a little pricy to me, and the paper wrapped the meal isn‚Äôt convenient to eat at all,\n\n13 Jun 24‚Äô\n\nBack to here ordered teriyaki chicken burger set meal $$9.95.\n\nIt come with fries & hot lemon tea , my favourite.\nFrankly, I like their teriyaki chicken burger & rice burger & tender chicken meat üëç\n\nSo far, I am very happy with the overall food taste .\n\n05 Oct 24‚Äô\nMy wife used to order take away here on her way home.\nSuggestion: if the MOS burger will consider install hand sanitizer‚Äôs will be better, because we used hand to eat French fries üçüüòÖ",
