francisco,4,"very nice place located right in front of the sea. there is always music. the cocktails cost a little less than other places and they are also good. the only flaw is that we had asked for nacho fries with jalapeno etc instead they brought us french fries... they tell us that here they are served like this... anyway everything, good. nice atmosphere",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115305498599370376626/reviews

Anthony Turner,5,"Stopped by Bikini Bar on Siloso Beach and was genuinely impressed! I decided on the bacon burger and was surprised by just how good it was ‚Äì a really enjoyable beachside bite. The staff were attentive, the food arrived hot, and you can't beat the location right on the sand. While my initial thought was that it seemed a little pricey, the quality of the food definitely justified the cost in the end. A great experience overall!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100695378012062392222/reviews
Isheeta Hazarika,1,"I recently visited this establishment and, while the ambience and food were undeniably impressive, the service we received completely ruined the experience. The lady who served us was incredibly rude from the moment she approached our table. Her tone was dismissive, and she seemed completely disinterested in providing any level of basic hospitality.

When we politely brought her behavior to her attention, instead of acknowledging or apologizing, she doubled down with an even worse attitude. Her responses were sharp and unprofessional, making it abundantly clear that she had no regard for customer satisfaction. It was appalling to witness such behavior in a place that otherwise exudes charm.

No matter how good the food or the setting is, poor service leaves a lasting impression, and in this case, it was overwhelmingly negative. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone who values respectful treatment and good service. Such unprofessionalism is unacceptable and completely ruined what could have been a pleasant outing.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112233678577948268866/reviews
