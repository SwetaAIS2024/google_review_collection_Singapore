Yellow Bear,4,"Free admission. A quiet and peaceful Tibetan Buddhist Centre near Aljunied MRT Station.
I’m not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism, so I won’t comment anything on that. I’ll just share some basic knowledge here.

Buddha 佛: a fully enlightened person
( not a god / deity ).
Amitabha Buddha 阿弥陀佛:
a fully enlightened person named Amitabha, Teacher of Guan Yin Bodhisattva 观音菩萨.

Bodhisattva: an enlightened person
( not a god / deity ).
Commonly known Bodhisattvas are
Guan Yin/ Avalokitesvara （观音菩萨）and Ksitigarbha （地藏菩萨 ）.

Guan Yin is a Bodhisattva, an enlightened person, the Teacher of Compassion. He is not a god / deity and definitely not a goddess. He helps all sentient beings who’s in need.

Ksitigarbha is a Bodhisattva, an enlightened person. He is not a god/ deity. He helps all sentient beings, especially those suffer the most in the hell realm.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
