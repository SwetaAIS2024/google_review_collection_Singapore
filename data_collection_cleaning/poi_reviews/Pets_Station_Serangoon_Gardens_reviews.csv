Esther Tan,5,"My dog Happy have been grooming with Andrew from Pets Station Serangoon Gardens for almost 10 years now.

Andrew is incredibly patient and works with such skill and care, transforming my pet into his best self.
We always get compliments from families, friends and strangers about his hair cut!

Happy always look forward to his shower sessions/grooming and walks into the salon by himself üòÇ

I will not bring him to anywhere else except for Pets station! I hope Andrew will always be there *fingers cross*",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104317281249128655083/reviews

Alexia Ho,1,"UNETHICAL BREEDING:
We bought Clover, our Old English Sheepdog, from Pet Station back in 2021. She was just admitted today for emergency surgery for a ruptured lens capsule in her eye due to cataracts.

She is only 4yo. The surgery will cost $13,000 & we are not sure that it can even save her vision.

The eye specialist has confirmed that this is a HEREDITARY ISSUE. Both eyes have cataracts, just that the right one has progressed more quickly. She is not diabetic & as such, cataracts should NOT be something such a young dog should be suffering from.

This hereditary issue is IN ADDITION to the hip dysplasia issue which we discovered when we bought her. We brought her to a vet for a post-purchase checkup & were dismayed at the diagnosis. We even brought her to 2 more vets who confirmed the same. We highlighted it to Pet Station but because we love her, we decided to keep her despite her ‚Äúdefect‚Äù. To prevent the hip dysplasia from worsening, we bring Clover for regular hydrotherapy.

These 2 issues are clearly cases of UNETHICAL BREEDING on the part of their breeder in Hong Kong where Clover came from & I am not sure if Pet Station is vetting their suppliers carefully enough. At the end of the day,  it is the poor dog who suffers & the owner‚Äôs heart breaks, while your pockets are full $$$. I am upset that they have NOT been stringent in checking the breeders they import their puppies from & only think about profit.

So, buyers, please beware!!!!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114995891215704746987/reviews
sushan,5,Arranged to view the puppies over there and was attended by Shi Chyi. We viewed a few puppies coz we want to see which one we could vibe more as we‚Äôre fine with most breed. Shi Chyi was patient and would explain to us the personalities of the puppies. We didn‚Äôt get one on the spot coz we didn‚Äôt want to rush into it and we didn‚Äôt felt pressured to either. Eventually we got a poodle and the after service was really good as well üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116806135742349844639/reviews
