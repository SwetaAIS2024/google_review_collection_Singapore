William Lu,5,"Located at level 5 open space of tampines hub. Has many variety of plants here and seems like good spot to watch soccer match held in here as well. It has no seat here, however, the view was ok. The place is opened for public, I don't know who can be authorised to plant things here.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews

Aparna A,4,"This community garden has a lot of vegetable plants like brinjal, tomato, ladies finger, chilli, etc. It presents pleasing greenery on the open area. Children will enjoy seeing all the vegetables right on the plants. This is a great initiative by Our Tampines Hub and the residents of Tampines! Heard that the vegetables are given away to the residents.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115841588924741000793/reviews
Ngee Wah Ng,5,"My family visited the Eco-Community Garden at Level 5 of Tampines Hub today. Many spices, fruits and vegetables were planted in the Eco-garden. There are oregano, chin chow, red chilli padi, Aloe Vera, fig, lady's finger, chye sim, Chiku, lettuce, tomato, costus, pumpkin, mango, papaya, and many more which I can't recalled. It is a good place to visit with young children as they will be surprised to discover how the plants look in real life. It is a good bonding place for elderly to share their gardening knowledge with the young ones. Furthermore,  the Eco-garden was well maintained. Oh! I was told that the produce harvested will be used in culinary classes hosted at Tampines Hub. I hope the Eco-garden will sustain with the support of Tampines residents and visitors.  Well done.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117507372873437369551/reviews
