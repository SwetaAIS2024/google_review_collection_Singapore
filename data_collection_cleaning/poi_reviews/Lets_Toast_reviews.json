My 89 y o mom-nlaw would have liked a root beer float but saw it too late. And Martin noticed her food was last to arrive and she had finished her pick guava, he kindly topped up her glass so nice if him.\n\nWe will be visiting again as we didn’t get to try all the food and there were so many yummy looking things on their menu.",

The cappuccino ($5) is not bad, I think the used the beans from Lavazza.\n\nThey have a wide ranging choice of food, I think I saw spaghetti, sandwiches etc. They also have all day happy hour for beer and stout.",

      "text": "Already had lunch when I happened on this newly opened cafe. So just had the beef pie... allegedly Angus beef.\n\nI felt beef pie was terrible - portion was about size of a small size girl's palm; crust tasted hard as cardboard and taste-wise as well. Only consolation was the fries which were crispy on outside n soft on inside.\n\nBut I decided to give them another chance since this was not their main dish and it's not easy to survive in food industry so shouldn't kill someone's dream so quickly.\n\nPlus point also for their self-served lemon-infused chilled water.\n\nPrices for coffee not competitive but maybe there is a reason for that...will know when next I try them.",

The menu is unique that it includes a fusion of local food or if you want simple toast and coffee. Most importantly it’s child friendly - high chairs and kids utensil provided and the staff are friendly and passionate about what they do. They have alcohol for parents which is a bonus! Definitely recommend this place for a weekend dine out with your kids.",
