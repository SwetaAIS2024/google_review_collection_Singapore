Maximilian Jackson,5,"Excellent chicken rice in the neighbourhood. White and roast done so well it is juicy. Rice is fragrant and chili is perfect. Ginger goes so well to complete the flavours. Highly recommend. Pictures and my review cannot do justice. Come down to try.

Special - try their lemon chicken rice. Wonderfully fried to perfection, the lemon sauce is unique and not harsh to the tongue.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111591021169192976239/reviews

Alvin Mah,4,"Nice chicken rice stall in a small but spacious coffeeshop. The speciality seems to be the lemon chicken but I find it to be quite normal. Tastes just like any deep fried chicken with lemon sauce. I felt that rice should be the main draw here. It is fragrant and at just the right taste, not too salty nor oily. The texture and look is grainy, not in a sticky lump, which shows how well the rice is cooked. The garlic chilli has a strong garlic taste and perfectly compliments the rice. It's also quite uncommon to find a $2.50 plate of chicken rice nowadays. I went for the $3 size and was fully satisfied.

There's a 'Hello Western' stall facing it selling chicken cutlet set for only $5.50. I'll be back...",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101731562623200370370/reviews
Ernest S,5,"This place is a hidden gem for locals, and arguably one of the last bastions of ""Cheap and good""

Chicken rice comes in Roasted, Steamed or Lemon (cutlet style) options, starting from $2.50 for a normal meal and up to $3.50 if you're a beefier person like me.

Add in some local staples like Tofu, Egg, Chicken gizzards and you have an enjoyable meal at a fraction of what you'll be expecting to pay.

Be cautious of the limited seating as it's a small hawker center, and queues tend to snake during lunch due to the offices and schools nearby.

They open early on Saturdays and tend to sell out by mid afternoon. Definitely a thumbs up if you're in the area.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109581329628901702362/reviews
