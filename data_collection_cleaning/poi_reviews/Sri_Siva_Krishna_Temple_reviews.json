The day i visited temple, i felt that the arrangements were not so good and satisfying. reason, when i step in to temple there were even no deepam Aarathana, which is very common in Hindu temples.\nAfter the temple visit was guided to walk to Ananthanam venue, where i reached was told everyone that, all got over and no more Annathanam at even around 11 am. This was on the consecration day and some more on sunday, which usually most people try to visit temple. I am not here complaining, just i am registering my feedback based on my experience as a devotee. Even i heard the same words from others in the crowd.\n\nI hope the management look at my review and improve the arrangements for the upcoming events.",
