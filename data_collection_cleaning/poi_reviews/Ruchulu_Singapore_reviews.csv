Myjbdbhome,1,"His upma was uncooked . So I informed the person at the counter and he took photo and said will inform the cook. It was a genuine feedback from me as it is below my office.
Subsequently during lunch after a few days when I went to buy the owner confronted me and said if his mutton is not cooked I should not complain in a very rude way before other customers . In a way very hostile that I would not come back to his stall again.
So next time friends donâ€™t give feedback to the stall .. inform singapore food authority with the pictures and let the owner face it legally with SFA.ðŸ˜‚",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106020507485006170315/reviews

Andrew Ng,5,"My friend ordered the briyani for our office, and I was thoroughly impressed by the quality, this is my first time having this.

Briyani rice was fluffy and spiced well
Lamb was tender, gravy was delicious.
Chicken was marinated well and crunchy on the outside, tender inside.

Best part, under the rice there was a big chicken thigh there, what a lovely surprise! Also marinated well and cooked perfectly.

Overall one of the best briyani in Singapore (in my humble opinion)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106909752943001882341/reviews
