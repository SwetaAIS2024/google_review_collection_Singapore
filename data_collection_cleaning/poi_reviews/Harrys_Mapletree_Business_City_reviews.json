      "text": "Ordered our food around 12:15pm and only got our first dish around more than half an hour later. The table beside us was wrongly served a beef burger, so one of the servers cleared the plate and walked to the other side of the restaurant (not towards the kitchen). He reappeared a second later with the same burger and gave it to us.\nWe waited another 5-10 minutes for our sides (wings and fries) to come. The rest of our mains came at 1:10-1:20pm, which included bolognese pasta, pesto pasta and a ribeye. The ribeye was rare and unevenly cooked even though we ordered medium. The bolognese pasta was slightly watery. The pesto pasta was extremely oily, and the salmon was extremely salty. At this point, we had waited for more than an hour and could not have waited any longer for the poorly-prepared food to be replaced.\nWhile it is understandable that restaurants may have long wait times, and granted that they were hosting a big corporate group, the group had pre-ordered their food, which should have given a reputable chain like Harry's ample heads-up to make sure that their other customers get their orders in a timely and satisfactory manner. There was little consolation given for the long wait time, and the server who served us someone else's food also got frustrated when we asked for updates on our missing sides and mains.\nI will not be returning to Harry's at MBC, and maybe any other Harry's.",

I love the laksa spaghetti the most. The fish and chip is ok. The cabonara is good. The salmon is fresh and yummy. The beef rendang is not as great though. So maybe can skip that.",
