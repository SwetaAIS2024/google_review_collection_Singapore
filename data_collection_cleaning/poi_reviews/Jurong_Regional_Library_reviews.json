      "text": "Amazing! Just no words to say. It was my first time to the Jurong regional library and the very scale of it took me in awe. So many collections of different books and so many different levels to go and explore! They have a community space for events and workshops , then there is a cafe and bakery inside with good food options. There is so many different things to explore! I couldn’t even finish going through all the sections! I will definitely go there again soon. The place is also located very close to the MRT  station and the Jurong east bus terminus . It has a sheltered walkway so we could easily reach the place even though it was raining. Many people from all different age groups were there. There is study tables with charging points. For some of the study tables you need to book in advance but for the rest you can always find and empty space. There are DVDs and other stuff as well. If you have to borrow books you need to register , but I just went for reading so I didn’t have to register anything. The library closes at 9pm and is open all days of the week. They will announce over the mike before the closing time so you have time to pack your stuff. I especially liked the photography section and farming section . There’s a separate magazine section and newspaper section as well. Different languages from Tamil to Malay to Korean you will find in the library .",

If you want to track which one got an error, why not you show what codes that they are not scanned in? The staff said that the codes (that gave me an error) did scan to the system, which they said it was “redeemed”. What a shame that your staff have in your mind.",

Still impressed by its cleanliness, calm and  peaceful atmosphere in addition to the silent air, the display of new arrivals also catch my eyes. Always full of study-loaded students and other book-lovers, you will still find a seat for enjoying some books or surfing internet on the provided PC's as the library is very spacious. Remarkably, there is a vast collection of books.",
