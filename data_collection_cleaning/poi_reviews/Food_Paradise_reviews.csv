Alexander Reinaldo,3,"Tried the mala, which is quite a disappointment as well as the Tissue Prata (with chocolate), not too bad, but little bit too salty for the crust. Yet to try other stalls but from these 2 food stalls, will say it is quite standard. Gonna update when tried other stalls!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108446373348289716691/reviews

Backyard Xplorer,5,Nice spacious coffee shop that is next to sheng siong and LRT layar. Table and chairs are not the normal that get you from coffeeshop but they are using wooden tables and chairs that add ambience to the place. The econ been hoon stall is the most popular and has the longest queue. Coffee and tea are nice but cost 10cents more per cup as compared to other coffeeshops,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102260626085916018032/reviews
