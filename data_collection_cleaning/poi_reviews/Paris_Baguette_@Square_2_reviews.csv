Gem cai,4,"Staff was efficient and courteous. Good variety of pastries and savoury sandwiches even on a late Saturday evening. I got the mini chocolate twists as takeaway. Tasted quite burnt with little chocolate flavours. The pastry though was nice, crisp and buttery even after leaving in the fridge.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108936225266166532481/reviews
