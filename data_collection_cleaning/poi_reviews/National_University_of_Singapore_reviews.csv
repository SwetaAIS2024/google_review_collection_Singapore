G Y,5,"Had a great experience today at NUS Open House 2023! Although everything was only taking place at UTown, it was an extremely vibrant and enjoyable experience. There were so many activities and booths around, and it was such fun and pleasure to be at the place!

Thoroughly enjoyed my 1-day outing to the campus, where students and staff alike are very welcoming, friendly, and awesome! Thank you NUS :)

P.S. itâ€™s a great time to visit on weekends just to walk around and admire the architecture of the campus!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111376056027123649376/reviews
General Twilight,5,It is a big university in Singapore and is very hard to get in. It has vending machines in the school and a shuttle bus to get in and out of the school. It has many fast food and hawker centre food options and has some residents hall for students to stay in near the campus. It is accessible via mrt and bus within a 15 minutes walk. There is a central Plaza in the centre of the school where many gatherings take place.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114314523990529053400/reviews
AKM Sazzad Hossain,5,I was amazed when I visited this campus back in 2014. Still I'm wondering how an university campus can be so beautiful. This campus is the combination of the any modern shopping mall (e.g. vibocity) and a decent forest. One can enjoyed these both feeling once he/she inside of it. Everything is heavily organized and the campus is so bug that you can not visit the entire campus in a single day. The campus is full of stairs and that's why sometimes it is called national university of Stairs.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114119702096499155575/reviews
