      "text": "REVIEW: Historic.  This was the hub for Serangoon gardens in its heyday.  Before it was a car park lot, it was the bus interchange; just before it had shops in wooden shacks on its perimeter, which had moved from their location at the open longkang (storm drain) along Kensington Park Road.  I remember people criss-crossing the bus interchange- we had the ability to jaywalk safely (sic) back then! üòÇ\nINGRESS, POKEMON GO: Oh, and for players: there are quite a number of pokestops and portals around the circus.  HINT:  then walk along Maju avenue... üòè Get your gym gear ready... üòì",
