Teacher Lynn has been exceptional in handling this challenging phase. She provided professional guidance to both my husband and me, while demonstrating remarkable patience in calming our child and helping my child integrate back into group activities. Teacher Lynn and Teacher Yanny expertise and understanding approach deserve a big thumbs up. We truly appreciate their dedication to making our child's experience positive and comfortable.",

I think they learn the most essential skills with MyGym at this age around social development, language development, gross and fine motor and gymnastics skills. Teachers are very good and child to teacher ratio among the best I have seen in Singapore, you are assured your child is looked after well and gets the attention for learning.",
