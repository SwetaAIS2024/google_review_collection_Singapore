James Patrick Yap,5,"Meeting Dr Lee was the best thing that happened to me in 2024. He has shown me kindness, compassion and empathy throughout my session with him. If you are seeking help with mental issues, do not hesitate to a book an appointment with him. I'm certain that you'll find the help that you need.

Counter staff Joanne was warm and kind as well, she will call to confirm your next appointment.

The prices of the services offered are very much in line with market prices in the private sector.

Definitely would recommend, 10/10.

Thanks so much to Dr Lee and the staffs at The Psychological Wellness Centre. Thanks for doing God's work!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112400899752753927092/reviews
