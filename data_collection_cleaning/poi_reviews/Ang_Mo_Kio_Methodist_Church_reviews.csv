Rod,5,"I miss this Church so much, the people are warm and welcoming, they take the time to get to know you.  The pastors are fantastic and fun.  Wish the entire congregation a blessed and Merry Christmas!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111856058770329625993/reviews
K T,2,"Everything is great, except the couple eating and chatting away in the overflow room during 10.30am service.

Maybe need classes on etiquette and basic manners.

Sorry had to reduce again, not sure why a buffet caterer came and set up during service. Letâ€™s rethink some processes.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106277363329877925469/reviews
Jennifer Lim,5,"I attend the 5 o'clock evening session. It is very warm, personal and welcoming. Love the people there too. Everyone is like a family member and the pastors are all very approachable and caring. I love being here as I feel belong, calm and enjoy a good time with everybody here and with God. Do come by and be one of us or get to know us. You will feel welcomed and loved. Thanks",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101046663631538731943/reviews
CCS,3,"Started as house church by a group of faithful in Mayflower Estate, the church had underwent many iterations and growth pangs.

Today, it is a modern looking church with an exuberant congregation of Methodists seeking the strength and solace of their Lord.

Ideally sited just opposites the Bishan Park and the Mayflower MRT STATION, it is geographically ideal for new residents of AMK, Bradell, and Bishan.

Go, pay them a visit. Ask about the story behind the stained glass windows. Ask about what happened to the rubbish bin compound that used to be the ""frontage"" of AMKMC. Ask about their ""most successful"" pastor in charge.  And, most importantly, where have all the founder members gone.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
Paul L.,2,My pleasure to review your new church.  Unfortunately all my best class members ( cell groups  ) upon settling down have had no continued contacts and ultimately gone to other churches.  Needless to say we have matured as Christians and even spread the words of God via Bible and Ceremonial rites and counselling.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115794840971836319907/reviews
