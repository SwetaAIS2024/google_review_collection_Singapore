Nimalan Gunasekhar,3,"A misleading shop name, the briyani offered is not a hyderabad briyani, itâ€™s more of a Nasi Minyak with mutton gravy. The mutton was undercooked with a strong mutton smell. Then rice and gravy were okay.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110857118116620846293/reviews

George Shashi,1,"Me and my wife went here today on 6/3/21. The place look so leftout, the waiter don't even understand anything. We sat at coner near to a field they don't have the initiative to even on the fan we was sweating. All the chair provided is terrible then those in pasar. The food came late we thought worth waited for, hi est speaking it was tasteless those in pasar malam taste better. The curry literally like water rice was like plain rice only, the waiter also went missing while we eating no one was there. There was a lot and a lot of flies the whole meal time we had to chase it. Totally wasted not recommend at all!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100142303190168508045/reviews
