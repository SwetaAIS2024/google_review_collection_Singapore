      "text": "Angel, from the sales team managed to convince me to sign up for the classes despite me having to pay cash upfront. I did not regret as I have really enjoyed myself. The lessons were well-paced. I like how the TV projects what the chef is doing so that learners do not have to crowd at the demonstration table.\n\nChef Daniel has an engaging personality and he held a respectful attitude towards all learners. Chef Ken worked quietly behind the scene, and he checked on the progress of the batter for each learner. Chef Xin has a jovial personality and is able to handle stress well.\n\nIt is hoped that the school can encourage learners to bring their own reusables instead of providing two boxes and a plastic bag for each lesson to bring home the baked goods. There is already is lot of disposables used in a single session for the ingredients.",

Thanks to Chefs Vincent, Ashton, and Carrie for their patience and guidance, as I had no basic training and donâ€™t cook either. I learned a lot, and the chefs made learning fun. I recommend these classes to anyone who wants to try something new or learn efficient baking techniques.",
