Dante Yukimaru,1,"Sold me food with slighlty undercooked pork liver and pork slice. Smells like very flesh and raw when i smell my food. (The entire food smells raw)

Went back and he told me that can eat it slightly raw and gave excuses like singaporeans like this level of raw don't know how to eat something like that. Blamed me saying that I never tell him I want it to be fully cooked.

tan reeve,1,"Dont be fooled by the prawn noodles over here. Just because they changed their signage, added some pics with celebrities and food reviewers doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s good.

One of the worst prawn mee i ever had. Akin to primary school canteen standard.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101764064052990513364/reviews
T. Zhxngyu,1,"*Zi char stall
Our family always order here on a weekly basis for years. Reserved a table on Friday for Motherâ€™s Day 6.30pm reached before 6.30pm our table was taken by other people and then that table and our table ordered food around the same time. BUT their food came one by one while we waited for 1hr 30 mins + and thereâ€™s was no sign of food.. asked 3 times and told us was still cookingâ€¦ great ! And then the last time I asked they told me the same thing again and I said I donâ€™t want it anymore.. they told me to wait a little longer ? Thatâ€™s crazyâ€¦ Donâ€™t risk, go other place eat, waiting here drives you crazy :) Everyone else got their food except us.. will never support again",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111567197424674970516/reviews
owen,5,"The mixed rice stall offers very insanely tasty dishes for a very affordable price range. I honestly believe this stall deserves a Michelin Star for how good their food is. In my opinion, the best dishes here are their Sweet & Sour pork and their ladies fingers, eggplant is pretty good too! ðŸ¤¤",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108820908785979128801/reviews
KH Chong,4,Super popular coffeeshop with many food choices. Overall itâ€™s clean and vibrant since itâ€™s recently renovated. Though the space is rather cramped during evening when beer-drinking uncles are hogging all the tables.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108028225713545630861/reviews
