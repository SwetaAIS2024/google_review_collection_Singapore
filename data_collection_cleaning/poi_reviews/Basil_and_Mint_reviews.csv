Sok-Hong Tan,5,"My family and I had a wonderful ‘home cooked’ dinner tonight courtesy of Basil and Mint at Amoy Street Food Center . Every dish from Vee is yummily delicious -  Basil pork , tang Hoon salad , beef green curry , chicken satay , fish cake and Kai Lan! And the portions are generous too.

It gives me great pleasure to recommend Basil and Mint to anyone who loves good Thai food at hawker prices. Definitely worth trying ! Go and try ! You will agree with me .",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107987967492292097553/reviews
Charles C,5,"My office is in the area, so I try to grab lunch from Basil & Mint at least twice a week. Red rice + eggs + veggies + chicken basil is perfect for leaving you full all day but not so full that you need a nap. Great food at a reasonable price!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111554720989365401976/reviews
