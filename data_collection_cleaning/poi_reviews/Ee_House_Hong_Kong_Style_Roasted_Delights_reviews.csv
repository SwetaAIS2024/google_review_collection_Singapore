Han Sin Chia,5,"Very tasty smoked duck. The sausage has a great char taste. Char siew was nicely caramelized n juicy too. The herbs taste is very good as well in the herbal duck.
The premium combo is very worth it!

1 dollar opening promo for duck noodles or rice is also great value for money. However, get the rice as the noodles with the sauce is a little too sweet.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100597066225087321607/reviews
RaiNb0wUni,5,"$1 smoked duck noodle or rice!!!
Opening Promotion was on when we went yesterday (Sunday, 12 March). There was a constant queue, but it moved quite fast.

Eat-in or take-away still $1.
BUT eating-in has its perks!
There is free unlimited self-service soup. Soup was very tasty had pork, chicken feet, radish, old cucumber, cabbage, corn, carrots, goji berries, red dates inside... Not sure if there are other ingredients coz that's all I saw in it.

We also tried the Mala 3 treasure noodle (三宝面) for $5 (char shao, shao rou and chinese sausage). The meats were done really well and tasted good 👍🏻

Hope this promo will last a little longer. $1 where to find nowadays?!

***updated: went again on Monday, 13 March. Added chinese sausage to the $1 promo noodle, and tau gua to another, and one $1 promo noodle, total for 3 pax, total only paid $5.20... SERIOUSLY... Where to find 😳👍🏻",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100142689849379549325/reviews

Chang Shang You,1,"I ordered a smoky duck noodle. The noodle is not cooking well.
Duck meat was burnt.
Service staff was so rude.
Not recommend to this stall.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115855084973094581896/reviews
