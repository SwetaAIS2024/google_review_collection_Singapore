Signature dishes like Singapore laksa, Hokkien mee, and prawn noodles are highly recommended for their rich flavors and authentic taste. The prices are very reasonable, the portions are generous, and the service is impressively fast—making it a perfect spot for a satisfying and fuss-free meal.",

Open to public.\nTried their stir fried laksa which had a mix of yellow noodles and thick rice vermicelli, 3 prawns, squid rings and tofu puff slices. Quite a moreish dish but I would think a bit more protein and a bit less carbs would be ideal. Didn’t like that the prawns weren’t deveined.",

The signature fried chicken wings are a bit overrated with the high price. The chicken rice with breast meat tastes very dry. The rest are good. Restaurant overlooking the golf course. Outdoor and indoor seating avail. Very nice flowers ceiling design.",
