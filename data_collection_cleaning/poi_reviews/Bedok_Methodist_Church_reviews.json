      "text": "The good teachers has left, the mission and aim of the school is no longer there. It is more like a company running to make money out of the children attending the school. The fees has increase dramatically with no regards with locals' affordability.  The compassion and the will to educate the children with knowledge is purely by the book. The management cannot make a rightful decision and can hardly decide from the right and wrong. We are very disappointed and has withdrew all my kids out of the school within a year. A private organization like this means, even ECDA cannot do anything about it as i recall through my email. The students are like customers to the school that feeds the system money to keep things going. Even if the kids are customers, there is NO \"CUSTOMER SERVICE\" period. We care about our children and that's why we think education is important but not to the school. Simple mindset of the current school: If you can make it, you make it, if you can't then leave to find another, we are unable to tend to your queries even in the simplest form.",

Housed in a modern building on its own freehold land, the church runs a kindergarten (very popular!) and has a vibrant ministry to the prisons.\n\nThis is a missionary-sending church and has work in various countries around the region. As with all Methodist churches, the pastors/priests are itinerant, meaning that they get posted to the various Methodist Churches in the country on a regular 3-7 year basis.\n\nEasily accessible by the MRT (Tanah Merah and the soon Sungei Bedok) and bus, with a free shuttle service on Sunday mornings from Marine Parade.\n\nThe Youth Ministry and Children's Ministry are especially popular here.",
