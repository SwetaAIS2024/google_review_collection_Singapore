Joelle Pang,5,True-blue speakeasy cafe based out of Delun's home! Barista roasts his own beans and you won't be able to get his coffee anywhere else. Wife Approved beans are my favourite - tasting notes of fruit wine and oolong comes to live! Remember to make an appointment and also be patient when finding Blk 634A. Totally worth a visit! ‚òïÔ∏è,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112071853536212660441/reviews
