      "text": "The pizza is nice, very light yet tasty. The chicken wings and calamari are okay. Ambiance is very chilling.\n\nBut only 1 thing that is quite disappointing, the pool table. It’s weird concept that we need to alert them first then the min. spend of $60 is counting from there when we already spend 3x of $60.\n\nWe asked once just to check if we can play then they explain. But then we didn’t think we gonna play until our next colleagues came and decided to play. But by then, we already ordered another dishes and they still didn’t let us play eventhough the pool table is empty until we left which is 1 hour later from they said was reserved. So, yeah. Maybe it’ll great to share at the first place before customer order. ☺️ but the staffs are very nice and polite. Just the system a bit weird.",

      "text": "Korean and Western fusion kind of food. Taste pretty good and affordable, worth a visit.\n\nBurrata, Soju Clams and Mixed Wings are worth a shot. Can skip the Croquettes and Prawn Pasta. The spaghetti kind of over cooked, slightly soggy.\n\nHappy that food is served quickly, but the pace is too fast and dishes kind of cool down when we taste.",

      "text": "Absolutely loved the cocktails here, very beautiful presentation. My favorite dish was the burrata heirloom salad, lovely flavors and felt super light to start with. My burger was also tasty and my daughter loved the fries. The bacon on the burger should have been crispier and the onion rings weren't great. The onion rings felt more like what you would get at a fast food restaurant. But otherwise we had a great experience and I'm glad we ventured out for dinner here.",

      "text": "Surprisingly quiet haunt in a key part of Orchard Road that deserves more business! Was able to walk in at 7pm to get seats for my party of two. There is even pool tables beside the dining area in the vicinity of the store; making this a potentially good place for corporate hangouts. The food served is a Western-Korean fusion; with items such as Wings, Popcorn Chicken and Milkshakes on the menu. Dessert selection is pretty great as well.",
