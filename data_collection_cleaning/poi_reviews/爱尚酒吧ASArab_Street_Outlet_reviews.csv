Alicia Huang,5,"Friendly staffs and serve great food, the Hokkien mee is highly recommended, wok hey and pork lard that elevate the taste. Must go with their in-house chilli. They have pretty good live band too. They sang mostly nostalgic songs but still itâ€™s nice and chill. Will come back again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108907916049174975182/reviews

Axellina L,5,"The Hokkien Mee is superb! They really take serious about the foods taste, with crunchy pork lard, generous portion with big prawns, scallops and lots of gravy. The boss say the chillies is homemade with special recipe. Must come to try this. So much better than all famous Hokkien Mee outside !",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102931645698889997716/reviews
C S,5,Best choice to chill out with yummilicious food and impeccable service especially from Danny and Roger. The special of the day-  seafood lala beehoon was infused with great umami flavour. Beer bites were perfectly served and non oily. Ambience was cosy... with sakura and beautiful positive vibes.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112962032943632041409/reviews
