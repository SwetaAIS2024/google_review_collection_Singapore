J Leow,1,"The Chinese teacher did not allow my child to use the toilet because she believed that no one would need to pee within 10-15 min after using the toilet after lunch, and assumed that my child was only going to the toilet to avoid taking a nap/wanted to play in the toilet. Yet, the Chinese teacher didn’t bother to give my child the benefit of the doubt or even bothered to follow my child to the toilet to check if my child was indeed lying (or not). And the student to teacher ratio that time was very low. My child hence had to endure and wet the bed SEVERAL TIMES until we were worried there was a bladder/kidney issue as my child has been off diapers for 1 year. The English teacher was physically there but soul hasn’t followed her to work, and while planning to surprise our child, we actually heard her scolding and punishing our child unfairly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112918462363803299528/reviews
K Wu,5,"My two boys went to the school since toddler class and love the school so much! Very friendly and caring principal and teachers, who know every kid at school.

Yen Chi Teh,5,"I was urgently looking for an infant care around my housing area and usually in such short notice, most schools wouldn’t have any vacancy. So I approached LSH(being one of our first few choices as it is Sparks accredited) and the admin, Ying Zheng, was very prompt in her replies. Understanding my urgency and situation, she assisted me throughout and attended to my requests. The teachers were friendly and very informative, facilities are clean and organised, we were excited to get our girl started! However we had to withdraw her on a last minute due to a personal reason. Ying Zheng was still very understanding and professional in handling our issues and we’d be very grateful for her. Thanks again YZ!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100132260346968545185/reviews
