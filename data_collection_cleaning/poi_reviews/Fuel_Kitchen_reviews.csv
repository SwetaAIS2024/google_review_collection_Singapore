Li koon,5,"We got a table at 6.30pm om Friday without any problem. Place is not very busy. Steady steam of customer but not packed. The menu has a large selection of pasta, rice bowl and western. All are good. There is no dessert. The cafe only open for dinner Fri to Sun. Parking outside is free.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103194300749984878407/reviews
Sook Mei Cheong,5,"Came a few times and it's consistently good! Highly recommend this place for their great food and ambience - the vibes are laid back and perfect for chilling the weekend away (or pretend it's the weekend).

William Lu,5,"I was craving for pasta and came here to get one for lunch. It was great. I loved the pasta with crispy pork and the egg on top.

Can customize own pasta but didn't try it yet. Maybe next time.

I would come back again to try their other pasta whenever I am craving for one.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
