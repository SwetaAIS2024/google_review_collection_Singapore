Leave us the hangers so that we can hang the clothes on the rack for easy trying for goodness sake! Used to be so much better when they are still at Jcube. Service is so so now at WG.",

      "text": "I visited the store on 30/11 and it was an unpleasant experience. The staffs are busy chitchatting instead of assisting customers. When I needed help with the promotional items, the staff said you just have to flip through the price tags to check and you have got all the time to look through the clothes. She also briefly said the pants, dresses etc have no offer. Wow, that ain’t helping. By the time I made payment and left the store, they are still chitchatting. One of the rare times I experienced this kind of situation.\n\nOn a positive note, maybe to take a break from talking, one staff saw that I was carrying a big bag of items and kindly asked me to leave it at the counter first. Another staff also kindly showed me which clothes have the same promotion price.",
