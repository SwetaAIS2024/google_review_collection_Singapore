      "text": "We had an extremely disappointing experience at this stall due to the rude and unprofessional behaviour of both the boss and staff. Despite confirming our payment via PayLah!, the boss still keyed in the wrong order and then had the audacity to demand additional payment.\n\nThe service was equally appalling. The female staff member carelessly left our takeaway order on the table without informing us, forcing us to check it ourselves. When we requested red and green chili, she impatiently grabbed only green chili from the fridge, showing clear annoyance.\n\nThis wasn’t an isolated incident. During our previous visit, a kitchen staff member from China actually yelled at us just for asking for chili. If certain condiments are unavailable, they should be clearly stated, especially for a Zhi Char stall.\n\nWith such an arrogant and dismissive attitude, it’s no surprise that this place is losing customers. They are not the only food stall in Fernvale, so it’s baffling why they think they can get away with such poor service. We will certainly not be returning.",

Their sweet sour fish is worse, the fish is hard felt like chicken meat (maybe not fresh) and the rice is sticking together like rice balls.\n\nNot to mention there's also increased in price.
