Boon Hee Chua,5,"Been eating the nasi lemak from this store for 30+ years since I was a kid staying opposite block. Although I shifted elsewhere, I would still go back once a month to eat this nasi lemak which just reminds me of my childhood.
The egg and chilli is something you cannot find anywhere else. I always order just egg and rice with chilli.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109989653873426935468/reviews
Susan Ng,3,"Breakfast full filled with treat (rudeness) from lady attending to customers!!!
Lady who takes order grumpy, rude and always rushing customer placing order (can understand she maybe tired, but that’s her business. Nobody’s job is easy, especially in Singapore.  Twice over  I went there to buy & given order to her for take away, but she couldn’t understand.  Is it difficult to understand what I mentioned?  3 PACKETS - 2 chicken and 1 fish yet she didn’t understand, I never had issues with other stalls placing orders, however, most stall holders if they don’t understand they ask again politely.  This lady has Bad customer service etiquette.  Food is acceptable but not fantastic, patronize it because is convenient for me.  Male chef friendly always wearing a smile.  Lady tending should improve her customer service attitude. Maybe she’s just rude to me because I am old…not up to the speed she needs.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116732597937188339412/reviews

Desmond Wong,4,"A decent nasi lemak joint with nice coconut rice and chilli. It cost about 4 bucks for silverfish/peanuts, fish, otah and rice. Will eat again but ask for more chilli.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114220117023892689160/reviews
Wee Siong Lim,5,"Tried this nasi lemak a couple of weeks ago.
Everything is freshly cooked!
Can see that the boss uses lots of effort to prepare the nasi lemak.
Chilli is extremely tasty, which completes the entire plate of nasi lemak.
After that, I also take away another packet with very delicious kuning fish, fried chicken wings, otah and fried hae bee with ikan bilis.
Will be back again soon!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101414250958200021398/reviews
