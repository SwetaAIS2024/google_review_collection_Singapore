The stallowner Ms. Toom saw me doing it. Later, while I was eating halfway, imagine my surprise when she came up to me with a freshly fried egg in a bowl at no extra charge! Was so touched! ðŸ¥°\n\nThis stallowner has integrity and is very kind and friendly. I will definitely patronise her stall again! ðŸ˜Š",

Soup was like braised gravy, a bit on the salty side but a change from the usual Thai food in SG. There was plenty of fried lard pieces, and fried garlic too.",
