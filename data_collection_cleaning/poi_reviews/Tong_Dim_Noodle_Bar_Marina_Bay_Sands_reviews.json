I have had multiple dishes from there, and it has been tasty every single time. You have a wide variety of dishes, including vegetarian and drinks. A good place to visit for food if you are inside the casino.",

You need to pay $150,just to get in.\nI find the food here OK. A lot better than sentosa casino. As a matter of fact.\nThe chef has monthly special dishes...\nThe noodles are hand made..\nAnd Q.\nAnd well.. If u gamble enough..\nThe meal might be free..\nAnd I seriously think all the crew are amazingly trained...\nImagine..\nCustomers who lost a lot of money... Pisssd and angry...\nAng Mo drunked...\nAnd also customers who are tourists...\nWho think they are very atas..\nThese are the customers they have to face everyday....\nAnd they are truly amazing to keep their cool everyday.\n\nThis restaurant is inside the casino...\nI would say the food is not bad.\nCompare to minus 1star sentosa casino.\nWhere u que up like prisoners.\nHere u have service and the crews are always quick and courteous.\nThey have the mthly special.... Which is cheap also.\nIf u gamble. Still got discount.\nSometimes.... I even just pay the levy to just come and eat and enjoy the quiet here.",
