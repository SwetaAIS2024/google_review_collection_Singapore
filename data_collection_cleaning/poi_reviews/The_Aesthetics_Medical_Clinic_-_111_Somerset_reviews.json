I was settling my bill when the staff kindly complimented \"Mdm, your skin looked firm and glowing!\" I knew at that moment I probably had the best skin ever.\n\nRecently, I was in between deciding what kind of hydrating treatment to go for and I was recommended HYDRAFACIAL, a signature treatment from The Aesthetics Medical Clinic. All I need was 30mins or more (depending on the skin condition)\n\nA multi-step facial done with a patented device that uses Vortex-Fusion technology to cleanse, and exfoliate by vacuuming out dead skin cells and other pore-clogging debris, to help shed the dead top layer of skin cells and uncover a more radiant-looking complexion.\n\nPores were extracted and customized serums were infused into the skin at the same time with soothing, hydrating, and anti-aging ingredients like antioxidants, hyaluronic acid, and peptides! A very gentle yet effective treatment that is safe for all skin types and tones.\n\nI was very satisfied with my glowing and more hydrated skin, pores seemed visibly smaller too! There is typically no irritation or even redness!",
