Ranier Reserva,5,"A top tier Japanese dining experience at Marina Bay Sands! Sen of Japan impressed me with its fresh, high quality dishes and warm, attentive service. The sashimi was thick-cut and incredibly fresh, and the Black Cod Soy was grilled to perfection, flaky, juicy, and full of flavor. The A5 Wagyu steak was melt in your mouth tender and beautifully presented. The staff were friendly and made the whole experience feel special. Perfect for a date night or special occasion. Highly recommend making a reservation, especially on weekends!​",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112529390269004011287/reviews
Elden Teo,5,"It's a great place to enjoy high-quality Japanese dining. The atmosphere here is peaceful with nice scenery. Staff were friendly, and the service was fast. The sushi here is honestly one of the best I've personally tasted, with its fusion and regular sushi types. Seats were available for walk in however I would suggest you make a reservation if you are dining in with a bigger group. Definitely would visit again.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101439904157932069624/reviews

Minh Vũ,1,"They claim that the Wagyu A5 Striploin, priced at $132, is a harmonious balance between marbling and meat. But look at what they served me—it was almost all fat with very little meat. Where is the so-called balance?

When I gave my feedback, the staff didn’t seem surprised at all. They simply said that the dish I ordered contains a lot of fat.

This is false advertising and a scam.

The other dishes I ordered were also of average quality, but the pictures in the menu looked truly impressive. Consider the actual quality and honesty of this restaurant before dining here.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111733851448574700793/reviews
