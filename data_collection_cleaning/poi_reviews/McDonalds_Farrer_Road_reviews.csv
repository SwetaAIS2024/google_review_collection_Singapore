River,2,"I am a regular at this location since I live nearby. However, my visit on Saturday, March 29th, 2025, was incredibly disappointing.

I understand that it is a busy Saturday around 11 AM, and the wait was longer than expected. But what truly frustrated me, was the behaviour of the two boys working at the counter in black uniforms (they were without name tags from what I recall). When they were checking my order for condiments, I witnessed one of them aggressively throwing the sauces into my bag, directly on top of my food. It was clear that this was not an accident, as they both chuckled about it. And they did this once again with my Happy Meal toy.

This kind of behaviour is unacceptable. Especially when the customer (being me) was right there waiting for my order in front of them - and it was clear that I was the only one at that point in time getting takeaway.

That said, I would like to point out that McDonald’s usually provides great service, and there is a regular worker here — a kind, tall Indian man — who always livens up the place and makes the experience much more enjoyable. It is a shame that this incident overshadowed an otherwise positive atmosphere.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115935642679665698816/reviews

Ian Yeo,4,The mala burger was an interesting collaboration item that added tatter tot potatoes to the menu. The sweet corn pie didn't taste that great but the tatter tots and burger was pretty good. 2 pc mcwings was great as always.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103846218459621328167/reviews
Christopher Hales,1,"I honestly don't know what's wrong with the night shift staff here. They consistently mess up orders and forget to include food. I've had mistakes from missing ice cream, missing mccrispy, single burgers instead of doubles, the list goes on.

It's understandable if it happens once or twice, but about 75% of the time I come here (if not more), there's missing or wrong food in my order. It's come to the point where I literally need to unpack my takeaway order and open every single box in front of them to make sure they didn't mess it up, and I don't need to waste time and fuel driving back there so they can fix it. It's utterly ridiculous",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110670114038695176302/reviews
Saifu Angto,4,"Convenient location on Farrer Road, fairly close to the Singapore Botanical Garden and its MRT station.  Also across the street from Adams Road Food Center.

Plenty of seatings both indoor and outdoor.  Fairly quick service with self-order stations.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
