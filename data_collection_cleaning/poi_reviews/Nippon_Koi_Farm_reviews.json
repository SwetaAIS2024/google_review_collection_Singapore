      "text": "They have a wide variety of koi fish from young to mature which is really interesting to see. Staffs are friendly as well. On top of that, they grow aquaponic vegetables like watercress, nai bai, and spinach ‚Äî all incredibly fresh and reasonably priced (about 3 packet for $10). I also tried their Brazilian spinach ice cream, and it‚Äôs definitely worth a shot. It has a subtle nutty, earthy flavor that‚Äôs surprisingly refreshing.",

He answered every query we had, and warmly showed us around different parts of the farm even though I told him we‚Äôre just students studying in the relevant industry and will not be buying anything!\nMany many different kinds of kois and they had a wide selection available!\nThe farm also has an aquaponic side that cultivates a few kinds of vegetables for sale. They also formulated spinach ice cream! If you‚Äôre a fan of light matcha flavors, it‚Äôs definitely worth a try and not as off-putting as it sounds.",
