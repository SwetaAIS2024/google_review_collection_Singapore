zz zz,5,"Guzman is an absolute gem! The vibrant atmosphere and warm hospitality made us feel welcome the moment we walked in. Every dish impressed—authentic, fresh, and bursting with flavor. The nachos were a standout: crispy, generously loaded, and layered with bold, fresh toppings. The staff went above and beyond with thoughtful recommendations and attentive service. Whether you’re craving hearty Mexican comfort food or a lively dining experience, Guzman exceeds expectations.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102847622160152901837/reviews
Grace L,5,"The food here is delicious (kids like it too), the service is good, people here are friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming. One thing that this restaurant can improve on is not overgrilling meat to the point of burning. After giving feedback on that, they were more careful, but still have rooms for improvement.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105124869301581845584/reviews

JAO JAO,5,"I had a fantastic meal at Guzman y Gomez at Novena Velocity! Their quesadilla was incredibly tasty, with fresh ingredients and perfectly melted cheese. The service was impressively fast, and they provided a variety of sides, including flavorful dipping sauces, fresh cilantro, onions, and green chili peppers (not sure what type, but they added a delightful kick). Highly recommended for anyone craving authentic and delicious Mexican food in Singapore!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101237592496501407589/reviews
