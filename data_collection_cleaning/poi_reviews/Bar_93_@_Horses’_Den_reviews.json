Chrysanthemum Negroni and Sakura Flower Martini - tired of the bar scenes? Beginner or connoisseur? No matter thereâ€™s joy for any visitor.",

I had 3 cocktails, which are all different and tasted according to my request.  The 1st was a rough coffee and spicy, followed by a negroni and ended with a pi pa gao favoured cocktail. We also tried the beef steak and egg mago with bread. Hopefully, we get to come back again soon even though they have a long waitlist.",
