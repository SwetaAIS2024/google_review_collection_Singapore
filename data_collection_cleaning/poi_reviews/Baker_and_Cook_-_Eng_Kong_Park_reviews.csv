Chi Hong Hwang,4,"Went for a light lunch after church on Sunday and found the place pleasantly empty. I was concerned it would be crowded with the brunch crowd. Had a great time chatting with my wife. Nicely redone from the previous cafe with full length glass panels so light filled and serene. Food is usual B&C fare. Like the beetroot energy salad, very refreshing.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103614009093464438172/reviews
Edmund Tan,5,"Came to this lovely place to meet my wife's client for an appointment. The bread, pastries and drink selection look amazing! I ate a wonderful chocolate eclair paired with a nice pot of green tea. The combination was wonderful. I am a disabled person and needed to use the toilet, the friendly staff Nicholas kindly and patiently guided me to the toilet outside the cafe and also opened the door for me. I had a great experience with this cafe and I wholly recommend it to everybody who appreciates great bakes and tea!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104777817123060984669/reviews

Mei Yi Yeap,4,"Came here a couple of times. Opens early and very quiet in the morning and gets rather busy by brunch. Decent croissants, kouign amman rather disappointing.
