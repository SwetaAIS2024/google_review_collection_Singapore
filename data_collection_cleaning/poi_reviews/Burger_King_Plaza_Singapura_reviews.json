They are mostly expensive, not filling, weird, or not fast/easy.\n\nI remember there used to be a foodcourt but couldn't find it now, so, we settled for Burger King. Burger King is not a economical fast food, but it's familiar to get if you want something fast and simple.\n\nSince a while ago, I feel the burger's quality has gone down but yeah, it's still okay.",
