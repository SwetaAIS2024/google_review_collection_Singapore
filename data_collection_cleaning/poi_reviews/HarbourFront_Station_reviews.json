      "text": "As a tourist visiting Singapore, I was excited to experience the Sentosa Cable Cars. Unfortunately, my visit to the ticket counter was met with one of the worst customer service experiences I've had in years.\n\nThe staff member at the counter, whose name tag read Amira, was extremely rude, unprofessional, and lacked basic courtesy. Her approach was dismissive and unfriendly, which is not something you'd expect in a world-class tourist destination like Singapore.\n\nHaving worked in customer service for years, I was truly shocked by the way I was treated. A place that attracts millions of tourists should ensure that frontline staff are trained to handle visitors with respect and kindness.\n\nI also noticed similar reviews about this particular staff member, which suggests this is not an isolated incident. I hope the management takes serious note of this issue and implements appropriate action or retraining to prevent future visitors from facing the same disappointment.",
