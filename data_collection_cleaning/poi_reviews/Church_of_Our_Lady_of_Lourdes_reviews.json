      "text": "I visited this church for the first time after the renovation. I previously visited in 2019. The ambience and decor in the church is beautiful. It has received a major lift although it was quite a good church before the renovations.\nI quite like the choir that played at the 6:15 mass.\nParticipation by parishioners was seen.\nI had a wonderful experience. What I observed is that mass frequency is more than it is at some other parishes, so the people density for each mass is less (this is actually a good thing) which means there is plenty of place to sit even if you come five minutes before mass.\nThe confession room was also occupied continuously so a priests were always available. Also a good thing.\nI definitely will be going back here and if you are around this area, I recommend going to this church.",
