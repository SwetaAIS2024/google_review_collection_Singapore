Malu Ker,4,"This was my second time at this restaurant, and we chose the meat buffet again. I absolutely loved the garlic pork belly‚Äîit was so flavorful! The Thai milk tea was a highlight as well. While the ambience isn't the best, it's still a great spot for a casual dinner. I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to returning!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116530565747158545622/reviews

IRENE PEI CHEN NG,5,"With this price range, I can't ask for more. It seems they‚Äôre using boneless chicken leg meat instead of chicken breast. The bacon and smoked duck are thicker than usual. The polite and friendly young man definitely deserves our support!üëè",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108250427461366515016/reviews

Chua Cheng Yao,2,"Came here because of good reviews but was super disappointed. Got the buffet option, sides was alright. But the marinated meats were almost inedible, dk suey anot coz weekday then not fresh. Meat were super tough, and marinade flavour cannot taste.
Bangkok street mookata nearby would be a better option for all.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116630756988350921732/reviews
