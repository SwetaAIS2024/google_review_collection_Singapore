S P,1,"Overpriced and overconfident staff from Bethesda Medical. Overall a disappointing experience at 38 Margaret Drive. Prices increased too quickly and service can’t match with their asking. Poor ventilation. Medical group relies on their tenants to bring crowd in.
Fruits are better at nearby Sheng Shiong.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105787088666535072728/reviews
Xiongqing Lin,5,"I had a great experience at Bethesda clinic at Margaret. Dr. Chen is very patient and clearly experienced, she took the time to explain everything in detail and made me feel comfortable throughout the consultation. The clinic staff are also incredibly friendly and helpful, making the whole process smooth and pleasant. I visited under my corporate insurance and really appreciated the fully cashless service. Highly recommend this clinic for anyone looking for professional and hassle-free medical care!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106216132611736775291/reviews
Jit King (Zich),5,"Conveniently located in the neighborhood, clinic charges are within range of private clinics. After consultation there are various food options within the same vicinity.

The receptionists are helpful and welcoming. Doctor Chen is also experienced and explains medical conditions well.

Clinic also accepts cashless payment modes for convenience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105523276431974550063/reviews

Ong JY Jessica,1,"Medical clinic is fantastic, short waiting time and professional doctor. Would totally recommend.
However the dental clinic is one of the worst. Almost uncontactable despite multiple calls and messages left on the number given. It’s easy to make appointment online but it’s never confirmed until the receptionist gives a call. After which, any changes needed, it can’t be reached. I had to go all the way to the clinic to confirm my appointment.

Suggest that the clinic looks into their customer service. Good service by dentist but the before/after care is way below expectations.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114835177060892323303/reviews
