Donsah91,4,"Shoutout to Nancy—an absolute gem! From the moment I walked in, she made me feel right at home. Her hospitality was unmatched, and she went above and beyond to help me understand the perfect mix of sauces, meats, and toppings to elevate my order. If you’re ever unsure what to get, Nancy’s your go-to. She doesn’t just serve food—she serves an experience!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105112194550786348544/reviews
White Li,5,"I have been to different branches of Stuff’d. The Bugis one is the best so far. The staffs are all friendly, helpful and efficient. They have never made any mistake in my orders. The portion is just right and always fresh. I noticed that I turned myself into a regular to this branch!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112096693200896081908/reviews
shar lim,5,"Stuff’d
First time we patronised this Bugis branch yesterday as we were there for a meeting. Usually we go to the one near our house.
Ordered our fave & the servings with sauces & sides were generous here & the lady staff Nancy was friendly and very fast in preparing my order. Yummy pulled lamb burrito & daily bowl! Will definitely come to this branch whenever possible!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111534299819448508878/reviews
Xin Ru,1,"Ordered 2 daily bowls, the smoked salmon portion was okay, but the chicken daily bowl was soo little. The bowl so big but my portion only half of the bowl. This outlet always gives very little portion, and inconsistent. Very disappointed. The staffs dont look inviting either, sometimes when i am thinking of what ingredients to get because the ones that i want are sold out, they will give the unhappy look.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112508564165838558643/reviews
Farah Irfahyanna,3,"I’ve purchased at this outlet several times and it seems like there isn’t much improvements. I’ve always been approached with unfriendly staff and the portion given today was so little compared to usual. I ordered a daily bowl chicken and she didn’t asked what I wanted and straightaway took the veggies and put into my bowl. I was frustrated because she didn’t asked me what I wanted and spoke in an unfriendly manner. It just seemed like she didn’t want to work there. The previous time I told myself not to buy from this outlet again but I wanted to give a try once more to see if they made any changes but no, it gone from bad to worse. This is just my personal experience, I wouldn’t come back to the store again.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103399740038800586155/reviews
