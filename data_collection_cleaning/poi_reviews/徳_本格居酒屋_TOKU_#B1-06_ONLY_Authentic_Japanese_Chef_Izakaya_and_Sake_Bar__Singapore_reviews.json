Owner is very friendly and welcoming to introduce us on which sake to drink, what food to go with the sake. The staff is extremely friendly too. Owner's idea of the shop is alcohol first, community second, food third. While I'm not sure if the owner would be happy to hear this, but the food was great! We will try other sake the next time, adjusting to what we had this time.",

      "text": "When I first stepped into this bar, I feel like I’m stepping into a part of Japan. Whenever I found a place filled with Japanese, it must have meant either the food is nice, the food is authentic or both. I feel over here, it’s both.\n\nI had an awesome experience yesterday night, and was greeted by very warm hospitality from the owner and the other patrons.\n\nOne thing that probably added to the great experience was allowing the owner to make recommendations, both the sake and the food.\n\nSo I had some very special food that I would never dream of trying, and they turn out to be very nice. There were dishes like shark heart and baby squid, and a third dish frankly I can’t remember what it was now (the meat ball looking dish).\n\nAnd the highlight, I would say is still the sake which both my friend and I really enjoyed it very much. Will definitely return again",

The food, while delectable, are mostly light bar bites and are prepared for maximum enjoyment with sake.\n\nHe regularly cultivates relationships with breweries back in Japan. Sake selections are seasonal and you will be able to sample sakes that are only available for a limited time.",
