Lau Guan Zhen (Sean),5,"If you’re in Clementi and craving a comforting bowl of fish soup, Song Fish Soup is a must-visit. Their sliced fish bee hoon is a standout—firm, fresh fish slices served in a light, subtly sweet broth. The addition of bitter gourd and cabbage adds a nice crunch and balances the flavors well. For something richer, the fried fish bee hoon in milky broth is equally satisfying, with crispy fish pieces that soak up the creamy soup beautifully. Don’t forget to try their unique chili sauce with fermented bean curd—it adds a delightful umami kick. The stall has earned a Michelin Bib Gourmand, and it’s easy to see why. Be prepared for a queue, but it’s well worth the wait!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111510773764729640794/reviews
Jit Sandhu,5,A long queue normally is a good sign of good food and this was worth the fifteen minute wait. The fried fish soup had a nice creamy fish broth that was flavourful and rich. The soup had bitter gourd which gave a nice firm texture to each bite. The noodles were firm and tasty. While the fried fish was fleshy and the batter a little crispy. Overall very enjoyable and worth the wait.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107828362774544806287/reviews
snk,4,Long queue. Sliced fish is fresh and tender. Soup is good but ordinary. Maybe I have too high expectation.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111705105142049227184/reviews
Zyin W,3,"Was here for dinner and expected there is a queue. But the queue doesn’t stop even when the shop is closed and just serving who are still in the line. To me, the soup is very salty. Not the seafood fishy kinda salty. But the overall still acceptable.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116916832921600340121/reviews
Lisa Yoong,3,"Attracted by the long que and Michelin star, I ordered the basic fish soup with rice to try.
Not very flavourful and the soup is a bit salty. Overall it’s just a normal fish soup.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100515155800261808239/reviews
