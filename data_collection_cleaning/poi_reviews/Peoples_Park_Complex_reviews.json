The mall has a dollar store, massage stores, currency exchange stores, some food stores, electronic stores, clothing stores, shoe stores, and more. I‚Äôd say the food court and food stalls outside are more exciting to visit especially for a quicker visit but still you got some nice places in the mall.",

Bought scads of beautiful fashion from ‚ÄúIrene‚Äù on the 3rd level at reasonable prices, lots of fabric too for my quilts. We took the ERP to People‚Äôs Park Complex and you could almost eat off the floor on this National rail system. Just bear  in mind some stores don‚Äôt open early. We came at the suggested 10am time and had to wait a bit to get in the best shops, which opened  two hours later.",
