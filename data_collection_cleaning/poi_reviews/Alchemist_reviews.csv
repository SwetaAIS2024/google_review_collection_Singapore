Dan Tabifranca,5,"Really enjoyed our time at Alchemist. We got to chat with the owners, a lovely couple who were so friendly and welcoming. They made us feel right at home, and it was a nice touch that they brought out some food too.

The bar has a cool, relaxed feel to it, which we really liked. It's got its own unique vibe. We were actually surprised to find out they just opened recently, everything felt so comfortable already.

Wishing them the best with everything!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107015969075022036127/reviews

Cindy Cheong,5,"This is a newly opened restaurant cum bar at the Sunway Boulevard area. They offer an array of food from Himalayan to South Asian to Western on weekends; their weekday menu is a bit simpler. What I really enjoyed about this place was the cozy vibe, and the warm service. The owners do their utmost best to make sure that we were well taken care of. They fed us lots of delicious food, all catering to our palate. On top of that, the lady boss gave us complimentary sausages and insisted to treat us to some french fries when we were already so full that we could hardly get off our seats. Both owners were super friendly and chatted with us as though we were their old friends. This is a fine example of unreasonable hospitality, which is hard to come by these days.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111749919931881488738/reviews
