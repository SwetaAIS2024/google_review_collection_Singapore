      "text": "Ulu Pandan Park Connector is a well-loved green corridor in the West, stretching alongside the Ulu Pandan Canal. It links key residential areas like Ghim Moh, Clementi, and Pandan Gardens, while connecting to other major trails like the Rail Corridor and Bukit Batok Park Connector.\n\nIt’s a great route for walking, running, cycling, and even birdwatching with wide, well-paved paths and plenty of greenery along the way. The connector also passes by several small parks — including Faber Heights Park — and offers occasional rest spots and fitness corners. While not the most scenic path in town, it’s peaceful and practical, with good connectivity and a strong community vibe.\n\nI’d rate it a 4 out of 5. It’s functional, accessible, and enjoyable for daily exercise or a weekend ride.",
