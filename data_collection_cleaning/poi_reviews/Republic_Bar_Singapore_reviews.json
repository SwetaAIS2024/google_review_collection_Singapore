      "text": "We had the set lunch here and it was value for money. To start, we sampled both the salad and mushroom soup, which were flavorful and satisfying. For the main course, we ordered the tenderloin and salmon fillet. The tenderloin cooked to medium was incredibly tender and juicy. The salmon fillet was paired with fresh vegetables and mashed avocado which i really loved. For dessert, we tried both the rich lava cake and the tropical fruits. The lava cake was a true highlight, decadent, warm and perfectly complemented by the ice cream. The tropical fruits offered a refreshing contrast, though the sorbet had a tangy and sour kick. Also, love how there was a piano performed within the restaurant itself.",

The atmosphere was fantastic, and the service was impeccable. I tried a few different cocktails, all of which were outstanding.\n\nI can’t wait to go back—Republic is a must-visit spot in Singapore!

The Caesar salad was a great start, with a generous serving of fresh greens, crispy bacon, and a perfect blend of cheese and dressing.\n\nThe main course of tenderloin beef was cooked to perfection, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The portion size was generous, and the quality of the meat was top-notch.\n\nThe Vanilla Sundae dessert was the perfect ending to our meal, with a creamy scoop of vanilla ice cream, fresh berries, and a crunchy wafer.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Republic Bar's Restaurant Week lunch menu for its excellent value, delicious food, and impeccable service.",

The ribeye steak was incredibly tender and cooked to perfection, a true highlight of the meal. We ordered different item from each category, the passion fruit sorbet is absolutely delicious! The lunch set itself is fantastic value for money, but what really stood out was the impeccable service.\n\nSpecial thanks to Benedict and Hassan for their warm hospitality and attention to detail—they truly made our dining experience memorable. It’s rare to find service of this caliber, and it’s the main reason we’ll definitely be coming back again. Highly recommended!",
