      "text": "I give credit where credit is due. Honestly, this is one coffeeshop where mostly residents staying around here will visit and eat as the ever popular 505 Jurong west market & food centre is just a walking distance. I love this Bak Chor Mee and potion is good too. Keeps me full and satisfied with a happy smile. Do order the number 2. Uncle may look fierce or arrogant but he is not. He says thank you too. If you are around here, give this a try. If you look at the operating timing, sells till afternoon so it will be a disappointment if you are expecting to open late evening or night. If i come here. It will usually be in the morning so itâ€™s alright.",
