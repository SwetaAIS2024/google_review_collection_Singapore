      "text": "Favourite cafe since we moved into the Bidadari estate, they serve good coffee and we love their coconut coffee shake, food also good from banh mi, pho to their must try prawn noddle.. was blown away by the prawn noodle the soup was clear and generous with the prawns (2 big tiger prawns and some small springy prawns). Fresh spring roll is pricer at 8.90 but is fresh and one of the best in Singapore coz other places the spring roll skin is tough. No GST only 6% service. Join free membership for points system to offset. Cafe has a nice rustic cosy vibe and decoration. Nice place to chill with aircon.",

      "text": "A Cozy Corner and a Delightful Duo: My Visit to Le Cafe Vie5\nStepping into cafe felt like a welcome escape from the city bustle. The d√©cor was rustic and warm creating a relaxed and inviting, chic and sophisticated, fun and energetic.\n\nThe Signature Latte arrived first, presented beautifully in a handle less cup. The latte was rich and robust, with a noticeable unique flavor notes\nThe milk was perfectly steamed, creating a velvety smooth texture that coated my palate. It wasn't overly sweet, allowing the quality of the coffee to truly shine. This was a latte crafted with care and attention to detail, and it definitely lived up to its \"signature\" status.\n\nShortly after, the Waffle with vanilla graced my table. The waffle was a golden-brown masterpiece, boasting a delightful crisp exterior that gave way to a light and fluffy interior. It was generously dusted with powdered sugar, adding a touch of sweetness without being overwhelming. The scoop of vanilla ice cream perched atop was creamy and of good quality, melting slightly into the warm waffle and creating a delightful contrast in temperature and texture.\nThe combination of the warm, slightly chewy waffle and the cool, smooth vanilla ice cream was simply classic and executed perfectly. The waffle itself had a lovely buttery flavor, and the vanilla ice cream wasn't overly artificial, allowing its natural sweetness to complement the waffle beautifully. It wasn't a complicated dish, but it was undeniably satisfying and a perfect accompaniment to the rich latte.\nThe service at was also noteworthy. The staff were friendly always ready with a smile and ensuring I had everything I needed without being intrusive.\nOverall, my experience at Le Cafe Vie5 was thoroughly enjoyable.",

Very tasty & well presented Vietnamese dishes. Both dishes were small on portion size but big on quality ingredients. Will definitely visit again to try their other dishes & also their coffees.",
