It is a big supermarket and it wasn't much queue after few weeks since opening.\n\nIt was good to shop grocery here, there are small cart for kid to push at this shop, no coin required for this cart.",

It has a variety of goods like seafood, vegetables, dry food stuffs, and home cleaning sections and 3 stalls eg roasted meats, sushi and yong tofu.\n\nThe store is moderate in size.\n\nEasy to find as it has a bus stop stopping nearby.\n\nI noticed the travelator is a little steeper.",

      "text": "It's already so crammed and barely space for a trolley to move in and they have to add unnecessary kid's trolleys in the mix. I once went during an evening and was rudely greeted with at least 2 kids racing their kiddy trolleys around with no regards to any safety issues. Those parents DID NOT even warn them NOT to race and happily laughing if off thinking it's cute?the fairprice staff? Nope. I didn't see any single one coming forward to remind them NOT to treat the trolleys as toys. Wrote feedback on this branch but till now no concrete replies of any action taken. This branch is quite fine but this horrible experience of seeing it turn into a children's playground really marred my shopping experience. Never coming back again.",
