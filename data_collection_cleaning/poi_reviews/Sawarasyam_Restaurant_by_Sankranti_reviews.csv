PR Chowdary,5,"Pretty decent one, heard about it many times and visited other branches. This one is quite cool and can be well enjoyed when visited during weekends. Week days might be crowded.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110813295576536010246/reviews
Manikanta Tankala,5,Sankranthi in changi is better than other branches with itâ€™s less price and having own kitchen. I feel that food is prepared fresh here unlike tampines one. They have high chairs available for children as well. Food is of good quality and quantity. Biryani is unbeatable any day. Bhojanam is served with pickle podi and ghee and thatâ€™s best.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100496635234006791873/reviews
Soniya,1,"I'm extremely disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The Manchow Veg Soup was terrible, with a bad smell and no flavor.When I asked the staff ,they didn't bother to do anything about it.The Chicken Lollipop was also a disaster, tasting more like ketchup than the promised Szechwan sauce and it wasn't cooked . To make matters worse, our food took a long time to arrive, which only added to our frustration. Overall, I was unimpressed with the poor service and bad food. ðŸ˜“",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107114403039619924371/reviews
Nit Kris,2,Firstly I donâ€™t understand why they serve a mountain looking rice on a small bowl & whenever we take rice spills all over. So had to ask for another plate to catch the spills. Pls reconsider plating dishes for comfort dining pls. Secondly my 2yr son drank half a litter of water by just eating 5 spoons of that fried (Ajinomoto laden) rice.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104173219833553479143/reviews
