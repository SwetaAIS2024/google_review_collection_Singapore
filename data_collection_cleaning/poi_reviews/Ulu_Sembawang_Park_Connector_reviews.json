      "text": "The actual connector is actually quite a short distance but it takes you to different parks which is awesome! The entrance is near the SLE flyover. Nice greenery, would come here again during sun rise cos I believe it would be beautiful. For walking, it‚Äôs pretty easy as its pavement all the way.  I walked through the connector and ended up at Mandai and it was only a short few minutes walk to Bird Paradise. Will definitely walk this path again to go to the Mandai park connector and Lower Seletar Reservoir.",
