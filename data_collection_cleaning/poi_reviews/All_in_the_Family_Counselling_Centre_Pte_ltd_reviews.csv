Pam Foo,1,"We didn’t go for any sessions so this is just feedback on the booking process which has been an utter disappointment - no empathy in the conversation process at all. Extremely curt. Similar to the experience by the other reviewer.

If you are seeking help, don’t get discouraged from getting the help you need from awful booking experiences. Do search on, there are good therapists out there that have helped and I’ve had good experiences with! And they don’t require upfront payment too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117464460342332566430/reviews
Ann Gacutan,1,"Absolutely no empathy in counselling. Tammy's words and demeanour are too straightforward and rude. I am Asian and my husband is German and we both think that her approach was very arrogant for our standards. It might work for extremely pragmatic people or maybe for American culture... In the end instead of getting help, we were both traumatised after our session with Tammy.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106620719312725927989/reviews
