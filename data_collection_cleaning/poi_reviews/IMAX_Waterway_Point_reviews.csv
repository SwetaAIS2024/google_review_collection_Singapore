Kenneth Ng,4,A wonderful place for me and my family to enjoy a movie. As usual the theater are very clean and seats are very comfortable. Hope these cinemas will still be available in future.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102596469154891891039/reviews
Jan-Sebastian Roth,2,Sound was great! Screen is damaged in 2 spots right in the center of the screen so once you see those dark spots you canâ€™t unsee them. Personally I found that to be really distracting. Felt like 17 degrees so wear more than just a tshirt. Compared to other IMAX theaters I found the resolution to be lacking. From row C I could see the individual pixels. Subtitles were quite pixelated. Seems like this IMAX is on the technical stand of 2010.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117644819020695645087/reviews

LeongYan Yoong,4,Best cinema experience in the heartlands with a large 10m x 18m screen. To watch the latest blockbusters like Avatar2 and Ant Man3. Worth the higher ticket price! First IMAX in Singapore also to be I the basement area so as not to disturb the other residents.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104961167743187290991/reviews
TRACY LEE,1,"One of the ticket inspectors was very rude. As it was the first time for me and my friend to go to the cinema, I didn't know where the room was, so I consulted him once. The first time, his attitude was not good and he didn't give a clear answer. Bad attitude",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115716388813590109185/reviews
