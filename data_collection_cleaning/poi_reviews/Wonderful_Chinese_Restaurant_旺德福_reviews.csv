Tsoi Ka Man,4,"Tried the chicken meat and my favourite bean curb stuff. It's spicy but somehow feel not salty enough, maybe it's a health thing but I would like to have just a little salt in.
Price is definitely affordable 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117045794841364142795/reviews
Andy Williams,5,"Food is splendid!

Came here once I knew that it sold Dongbei food (东北菜)

We came as 3 Adults and 2 Kids

All portions are quite generous, nicely seasoned and had an authentic taste.

Highlight on the 家常菜 as it appealed to us with the right amount of vinegar to taste.

Seafood fried rice is a hit with the kids and served as the base for the other dishes like the 回锅肉 and 卤牛肉.

We had tasty skewers too to complement the meal

The star was their special roasted lamb ribs! It was succulent and a big potion enough for a few people!

Will come again!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111545471976960250047/reviews
Eddie,4,"Located at the 1st coffeeshop of Blk 22 Sin Ming Road (where the famous 咸菜鸭 used to be), it is now a Wonderful Chinese Restaurant.

Kia Guan Ng,4,"Came here at 9+. Coffee shop is quite deserted but the coffee is the better one along this stretch of coffee shops. Price at $1.20, it’s very reasonable since most coffee shops charge more than that.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108972979221461010763/reviews
Abraham-Hannah-Rachel Tang,4,"The coffee here has the strong nanyang kopi power that attracts me !!

I like the ban-Mian noodle stall here and The zhi char stall which is Fuzhou style - not bad most dishes serves with lala clams

Chicken rice serves both steam and roasted varieties",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112354644586615817680/reviews
