      "text": "Gave them tapes for conversion. After one week, called the shop and It said not done yet. After two week, called the shop and the shop could not  tell me what was the status. I said I did not want o convert already and just wanted to get back the tape. They said they will call me back. After one day, never called me. I called them again and they said the tapes were converted already, but one of the tape cannot be read. Collection can be done the following Monday. They never told me which tape cannot be read. I think the administration is poor and lack of customer service.",

Thankfully 2 were working but was told 3 were spoiled n not converted. You can test it out if you are not desperate, prepared to put your patience to the test, and have little expectation. Good luck.",

Took 1.5 weeks at least with no update etc. Called numerous times to get an update, was told I'll get a call back, to no avail. Finally after 1.5 weeks, my msg was eventually replied.",
