The prawn paste chicken was so good I order it everytime I visit this place! The sweet potato leaves sambal was also really good! Would patronise myself multiple times. Super delicious and really a must try!",

A visibly popular spot where seats were sprouted beyond the restaurant vicinity and big family crowds could be seen patronizing. Their signature tofu was the highlight, soft, layered and flavorful. Otherwise dishes were good too, will recommend.",

Golden finger chicken, the recommended dish, was disappointing to say the least, looked nothing like the photo and tasted like black soy sauce chicken wing.\n\nAt least the seating area was not warm compared to the weather even without air-conditioning. Service was ok.\n\nFood quality not appealing enough to want to revisit again.",
