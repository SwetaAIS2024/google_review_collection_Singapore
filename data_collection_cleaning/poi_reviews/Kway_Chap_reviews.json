In times of high living cost, they are still trying to maintain a set meal at $5.80 is not easy. My meal with an additional soft and fresh bowl of kway cost a total of $6.80 which can satisfy 2 small eater. For single big eater, this is very satisfying until i need to take 5 mins of rest before leaving. I would recommend this stall and their other menu available. They operate long hours from morning till 9pm.",

The bowl of Kway Chup was bigger than expected nevertheless, though it cost more in the first place than other of such stalls which offer Kway Chup in smaller bowls...",
