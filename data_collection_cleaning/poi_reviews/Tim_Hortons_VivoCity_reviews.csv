Triveshni Sharma,3,"I ordered the grilled chicken pesto sandwich and the pistachio cream latte. The food was not it. The sour dough was too tough when I bit into it (not crispy). The  filling was average. As for the drink, I wouldn't call it pistachio cream latte if it's full of ice and the cream is barely there. I don't know why it was named pistachio because I couldn't even taste it. It was simple iced latte. I had heard so much about tim hortons and I was looking forward to it since it was my first time but this was a disappointment.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116296246389883887621/reviews
Ming Wei Lee,5,Nice spot and has a fantastic location that over looks the road. Staff are friendly and patient but some of the food items could be a little pricey. They are not as packed as Starbucks so I guess this is a good spot for a chat with your friends. Must try are their signature lattes.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107724540457866476907/reviews
khrhms,5,"Favourite Tim Hortons outlet in Singapore. Staff are always friendly, food and donuts are always fresh and good, coffee is always a delight. Spacious outlet with a good number of seats available. Will try new drinks on their menu.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
Honey Belle Dionisio,4,"Have visited Tim Horton's in Toronto and there is a big difference. The variety of donuts in Singapore are not much plus the fact that they are quite pricey! Though if you want to taste and experience Tim Horton's Singapore, then, just go for it. Anyway, we ordered the tiramisu and carrot walnut cake plus some black coffee and latte. Their cakes are not really exceptional. Can find better & yummier cakes at other SG bakeshops.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112880669662727512574/reviews
Devy Pribadi,3,"Ordered Original Iced Capp with skimmed milk, and tried Yuzu Cream and Cinnamon Sugar Timbit.
Forgot to ask less sweet for my Original Iced Capp, tasted a bit too sweet for my liking, couldn’t taste the coffee itself.
Yuzu Cream Donut was nice, texture was soft and fluffy. Cinnamon timbits was just normal. Ambience is okay, quite hectic at coffee break time. Service was okay.
Next visit: Ordered Mapple Cinnamon Latte with Skimmed Milk and Less Sweet, and tried their Tiramisu Mousse.
The Mapple Cinammon Latte was nice and lovely. It was enjoyable drink.
But unfortunately the Tiramisu was a disappointment. I’m a Tiramisu lover and this is not a tiramisu for me, it has no coffee taste or tiramisu flavour at all. Just sweet only. Just like you eat a sweet marscapone cream with chocolate powder on top, that’s it. Also the cake size is quite small, not worth the $8.50 price for 1 slice and some more no tiramisu taste.
Classic Egg Croissant was not bad too, the croissant texture was flaky, but it’s a bit too buttery for my liking. The egg mayo filling was okay.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827903087596800354/reviews
