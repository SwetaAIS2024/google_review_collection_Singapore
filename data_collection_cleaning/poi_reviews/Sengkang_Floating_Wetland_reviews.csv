Damcho Tshering,5,"Took a peaceful stroll through Sengkang Floating Wetland over the weekend—Singapore’s largest man-made floating wetland, nestled right in Sengkang Riverside Park.

The boardwalks over water, the calm of the reservoir, and the lush greenery all around made it a refreshing break from the usual routine. It’s fascinating how nature and city blend so seamlessly here—birds gliding over the water, aquatic plants quietly purifying it, and just enough solitude to slow down and breathe.

Grateful for spaces like these where one can simply walk, observe, and feel grounded.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833702802756994837/reviews

CK C,5,"This bridge crosses the Punggol River/Reservoir, linking East and West Sengkang. The place is quite scenic but exposed to the elements as it is not shaded. There is, however, a small shelter shaped as a giant mangosteen. You can also learn more about aquatic plants from the many signages.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Catherine Ling,5,Love this little boardwalk over the river with fun pavilions and seats. Wonderfully tranquil in the early mornings and evenings. Plants slightly overgrown now in the covid-19 situation but still wonderful to see. There are little educational placards identifying the species. 👍🏼,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104381248516022602975/reviews
William Lu,5,"Nice place to have a stroll around. Good scenery nice breeze.

There are a lot of turtles at the entrance from the park near the bridge. There were big one as well. Few people will stop there and gave them foods (mostly breads).",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
