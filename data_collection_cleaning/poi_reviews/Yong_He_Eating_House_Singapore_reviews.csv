Hrmgr,2,"Decided to try out this shop since doing a round for Geylang area. The Taiwan noodle was not to my liking as it served slightly warm and for a starchy dish, it affected the appetite. Few pieces of intestines in it and considered expensive.
The fried meat dumplings were deep fried to the extent inside was dried.
Soy bean drink was the only one I liked as well as the spicy chili.
I believe the standard had dropped since I knew the shop.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews
Cassandra Whitely,3,"We were greeted by two friendly staff who served us well. Allocated us to a windy seat, table 8. Thank you!

The food portion was average. If you are a small eater, it should fill you up.

As for the taste, mee sua was not starchy enough, pancake was very oily. However, the porridge was thick enough, and chilled soy milk was perfect in this weather.

As for the vibe, do not expect a restaurant style. It is just for a quick bite and not a place where you would sit to chat and chill. I am sure you get what I mean.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117740183119393035431/reviews

Midnight order. The last order I will get from Yong He. Very bad fried spring onion cake 蔥油餅 and carrot cake 蘿蔔糕. 蔥油餅 is dried and can’t be chewed like plastic. 蘿蔔糕 taste sour and not fresh, hard and dry too. Not worth the price, totally! $8.20 spent.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106746947295994047523/reviews
Vin L,3,The shaobing was crispy and adding the egg gives it a bit more moisture otherwise a bit dry. The youtiao is huge and worth the value but it's oily. The soy milk is tasty and can adjust your own sugar level. The scallion oil pancake with egg is on the oily side as well and we'd prefer a crispier dough.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104569248723038125407/reviews
Pynk Teo,3,"One of the few places (that I know of) has salty bean curd. Like many other reviewers this was the rave back in the heydays. Now it’s just kinda sad, and I think just like the crowd, the food has also dropped in standard. However their bean curd and soy milk is still good. Hope they bounce back.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114722646613316191873/reviews
