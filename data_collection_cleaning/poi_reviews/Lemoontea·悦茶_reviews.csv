Richard A Francisco,4,Lemoontea is not your ordinary milk tea shop. They offer a wide variety of drinks and some odd cocktails such as coconut milk mixed with watermelon or coconut water mixed with mint. Personally I love the different flavours I get to experience at this place.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116900802599741720903/reviews
Shay R,5,I liked their signature green tea with lemon. The guy at the counter was kind enough to tell me about the promotion they were having to buy one and get one for free. This review is for his good service and honesty.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104844571697213901373/reviews

shi,1,"Well branded and interesting menu at first glance. Unfortunately, quality of the tea (at least the one I chose) did not live up to expectation. Ordered the jasmine lemon tea. The after taste is sooooo synthetic! Both the lemon and jasmine donâ€™t feel authentic at all. Tasted like I was drinking air freshener. Also, more than half the drink was ice cubes. Ridiculously overpriced. Sticking to my chi cha and koi.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117066929648824833095/reviews
