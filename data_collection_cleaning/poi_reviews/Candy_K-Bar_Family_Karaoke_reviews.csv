Shiok Hoon Ang,5,Very worth for our first time 2 hours experience on a weekday 3-5 pm. The room is clean and seems to be well- maintained - have complimentary ginger lemon tea which I finished all and a small plate of snacks - good vibe and atmosphere plus the system is well better and beyond my expectations for the price I paid .,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100980764068783724099/reviews
Rachael Lam,4,"Visited on a Sunday afternoon with a group of about 15 friends.  The princess room booked for our group was spacious, clean and comfortable.  As we visited right after lunch, we had only ordered drinks.  Drinks menu has a good selection.  Service staff was attentive.  Charges was reasonable too. Nice place, will visit again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110306703793014187879/reviews
Eunice Ang,5,"This place is clean, the song list is quite complete, and the system is pretty good.

Their complimentary drink is nice (red date tea) with a small plate of complimentary snack.

Spent $10.55/person for a 2-hour session on weekday which is very affordable.

The staffs are also very polite.

I may patronize this KTV again, highly recommended.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115861113967769903634/reviews

keola,5,"it's my second time coming here, but i had a crazy amount of fun both times (once with a friend and once solo)! they let me reserve online easily and responded to me quickly and very politely. i showed up a little early, but they let me in immediately!

the usual tablet you use to put in songs was broken today, but it was no problem because there was a qr code to scan and slap in whatever songs you want. actually, i really prefer the qr code as opposed to the tablet because i can stay seated and not have to move.

a few things i really like about this place are the option to turn on and off the lights, the trash bin, and of course the really convenient mic covers! the rooms are really spacious too! also the ability to use youtube to look up songs is very very useful because it widens your scope a crazy amount. so fun! so cool!

my only gripe is that as a really shy person, the door's window being a little wide can be awkward cause i kept making eye contact with people walking through the corridor. but honestly if you don't mind that it's still great! thank you very much for the fun experience! i will be back :]",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114912406052455795329/reviews
