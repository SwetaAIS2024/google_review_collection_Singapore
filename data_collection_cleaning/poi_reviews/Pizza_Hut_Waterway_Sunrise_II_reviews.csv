J,3,"First time here and found out that there’s no $22 weekend deal (lot 1 has it) bought $25 meltz  sharing box.

Staff was talking and laughing loudly during meal preparation. Saw 1 staff in the kitchen and her mask was below her nose area. Didn’t like how noisy as if there’s no store manager to “look after” them.

Food was decent, came piping out. Chicken wing was one side roasted while the other side is “pale” I believed they didn’t not flip it. Nonetheless, service was meh and have to ask for the dip since it was not given. No chilli sauce available as well.

Toilet is available, tables were dirty.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108836346505805335103/reviews
Li Feng,1,"Pizza Hut at Waterway Sunrise II has been a disappointing experience. While the pizzas are decent and the 1-for-1 promotion seems appealing, the service is unacceptable. I waited for over an hour, only to be told they missed one of my orders. There was no apology, no compensation, and absolutely no effort to make up for the mistake. It’s frustrating and unprofessional. Order at your own risk if you value your time and customer service!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105807436200681938352/reviews
Gracie Ruiz,5,"The place was conveniently by the side of our running path, so lunch here was a much-needed respite from our run/brisk walk. Place was clean and cosy. Service is great. Food was good & warm and just hits the spot as we were starving from our run.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117044045193366313434/reviews
BS Y,1,"Service was bad, they don’t seem to want to work. Waited at the counter for a good 5min even when there is not a single customer in the shop! And look at the pizza
1. Pizza not sliced properly
2. Burnt pizza
3. The kitkat hershey melts? It’s all cheese and 5% chocolate",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106279960373898935209/reviews
Atiqah Rashid,5,"I had a wonderful experience at Pizza Hut recently and wanted to share it! As a fast food spot, Pizza Hut always delivers on quality and convenience, but what really stood out during my visit was the exceptional service.

Despite visiting during the peak dinner rush, the ambiance remained calm and welcoming, making it a comfortable place to enjoy a quick meal.

A special shoutout goes to Mishel, one of the staff on duty that evening. She was incredibly professional, efficient, and friendly—managing the busy crowd with ease and serving each customer with a genuine smile. Her positive attitude really elevated the whole dining experience.

If you're looking for great pizza with excellent service and a relaxed vibe, this Pizza Hut location is definitely worth a visit!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115787738146204271720/reviews
