Wasnâ€™t sure if they donâ€™t have a kitchen person in the morning so the FOH needs to deal with everything by himself. Poor guy.\n\nThere are set meals if you come in the morning, but coffee is just regular long black or tea. Top up RM 5 if you want other types of coffee, and another RM 2.4 if you want alternative milk. Great atmosphere though and itâ€™s very nice to sit outside to chill.",

      "text": "Has a significantly smaller and different menu than the Paradigm Mall branch, which was really unexpected. As a chain I expect at least some similarities. And there were also a lot of items not available. Water is self service in a cart you go to collect yourself. The staff were very friendly and kind, but lacked experience. I ordered an avocado smash toast with chicken ham... and they forgot the chicken. In the end they served it to me on a seperate plate. The avocado tasted very sour and strange. I am guessing it is lemon juice in the avocado, but it is seriously overkill and too much sourness. And for some weird reason there was only 1 egg haha. The other piece of toast was just empty on it own. Bread was also hard and stale to the point it was difficult to cut or even bite off. Quite disappointing, especially as the Paradigm Mall branch is head and shoulders above in quality.",

I donâ€™t mind them resting, but I dislike it when staff in some places are the ones making all the noise. The coffee was smooth, the air conditioning was refreshingly cold, and the jazzy music created a pleasant ambiance. Nice! I will consider coming back for breakfast next round.",
