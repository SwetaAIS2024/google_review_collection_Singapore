Guanny G,4,"A hidden cocktail bar at eco botanical park. The bar is located at first floor, and you need to ring the door bell for the metal door to be unlocked.

Once up the stairs, you will come into a nicely decorated space, with the logo of the bar, and you will be wondering if you are at the right place üòÜ

The door is hidden in the wall, on your left.

The bar is run by a young couple. You can order from the house menu or ask for bespoke creation. Just let them know your preferences.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110289275840637213691/reviews
