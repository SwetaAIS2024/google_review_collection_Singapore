CELINE NG,5,"Lived here for 14 years, built my family here.  Although condo is old but the facilities are very well maintained and adequate.  Friendly community of neighbours.  Good mix of young couples and families living here. Never have any issue booking to use any facility eg BBQ pits etc   Was told by some neighbors that the Feng Shui here is very good thus many continue to stay here for ages.

For tenants, very reasonable rental for such a huge apartment.
For owners, good spacious apartment to build your families.  Next to one of the top school, Henry Park primary school.

Plenty of enrichment centres at Pandan Valley, which is a stone throw from Allsworth Park via the back gate.  Cold Storage, ghim moh market are all nearby.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112272016791779262283/reviews
