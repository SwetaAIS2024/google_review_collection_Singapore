      "text": "[DONT RENT HERE] One of the shop with monopoly that does not bother about providing clean, secure bikes and courteous service.\nToday as often i pointed to the really old and rusty state of the “bmx” bike for my kid. Was ignored. Only for the chain to break later on. Waited 30 minutes for a replacement (out of 2 hours rental). And replaced by a bike in an even worse state whereby the chain was not oiled enough and was gripping. Of course, nobody cared about any feedback.\n\nMuch rather go to the cycling shop on the other side of the ECP. Just a few minutes difference to access the park - much better service and secure bikes.",
