      "text": "Unfortunately, the counter staff was not helpful in helping me get my medicine. The staff at loyang point clinic told me since they are now a swabbing centre, that they do not administer my pills anymore or in the future. She simply asked me to go to another clinic and did not bother telling me where I should go.  When I called Tampines Womens Centre to ask whether they have my medicine, the staff said that I am a patient, not a worker, so I am not allowed to ask directly for stock. As a patient and customer of Raffles Medical, this debacle seems so tedious and a waste of my time. The way she said was quite rude but how else am I suppose to ask? If I come to your clinic and you do not have the medicine, I have to make another trip to another clinic to find it. I hope the service can be improved. All I need is my medicine and I have to go through unnecessary stuff.",
