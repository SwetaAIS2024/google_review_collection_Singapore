Ryan Loi,5,"One of my favourite coffee shop liver kuey teow! Not over cooked so its really soft & juicy, prepare for long queues during lunch time! Then only thing I don’t like about this place is my reception is terrible, can’t even receive or send out whatsapp messages",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107268812029382908838/reviews

Yeen-Ling Chong,5,"The food court is located in a light industrial area and primarily serves the office workers in the vicinity. It operates only during weekdays and working hours. When we visited in the evening, only a Thai food stall and a Western food stall were still opened. We tried several dishes from the Thai food stall and found them to be authentic and reasonably priced. We recommend this hidden gem to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal in the area.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109572525588154807805/reviews
