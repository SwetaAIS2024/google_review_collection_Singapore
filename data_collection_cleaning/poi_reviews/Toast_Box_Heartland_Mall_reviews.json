      "text": "The coffee at this outlet is rather inconsistent. Some days it's perfectly fine, but other times it's far too bitter to finish. Today, I ordered a Kopi C siew dai and it was served without the evaporated milk. However, there is one guy who consistently makes excellent coffee. I always hope he's working when I visit. I hope management can address this issue and provide more training to ensure consistent coffee quality. The service is generally good, but the inconsistency in the coffee is a concern",

      "text": "This joint is one of my favourite place for my get to coffee ‚òïÔ∏è, the team are very nice & they keep the place clean by removing all the cups/tray/plates after customer leave. The counter staffs are all friendly & food and drinks are quite consistent. I highly recommend this place cos it‚Äôs very near to the MRT station. The only flaw side is the cafe is beside the window ü™ü & during very hot days the sun ‚òÄÔ∏è shine in and causes the temperature at the cafe to be on a more hotter side. Else not this is a nice joint to hang out for a talk with friends & business associate !\n\nAnd if you happen to see the cafe outlet supervisor Ai Li , do say Hi cos she is one of the most friendly person I know compared to a lot of other Toast Box outlet !",
