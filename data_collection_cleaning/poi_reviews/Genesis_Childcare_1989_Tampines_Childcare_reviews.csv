Genesis Childcare 1989 (Tampines Childcare) has been nothing short of amazing! The teachers are caring, patient, and knowledgeable, and they really take the time to get to know each child’s needs. The facility is well-maintained, and the learning programs are thoughtful and engaging. I appreciate the emphasis on both academic and emotional development, which has helped our child thrive. My little one is always excited to go, and we are so grateful for the wonderful care they provide. I highly recommend this childcare center to any parent looking for a quality and loving environment for their child.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106810436127684687314/reviews

Ivy Kwek,5,"Izac has been with Genesis since playgroup. Teacher Danica has shown great love and care to him in playgroup days. Moving to Kindergarten, Zhang Laoshi is always showing lots of concern to him in every aspect, food intake, education and emotional as well.
