Lionel Lew,5,"The set up does give a nostalgic feel, younger generation will never know the feeling. It may look and feel as if teleported in time, but the medical advancement is there. The clinic seems popular, as it was very crowded. Overall experience is good.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104407076388727840786/reviews
TNJ Housing Solutions Pte Ltd,5,"Clinic seems more like polyclinic nowadays but still as good. Like the doctors there which listen to patients and also straight to the point. All are good. Even has free drinks like 100 plus, milo etc for patients. Opening hours are long so not an issue if you are sick. Can just drop by.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103779904320049277745/reviews
Jul Tiong,1,"We stood at the door for almost 20 minutes, no staff was at the door for registration. During the midst, a staff with specs climb up the cabinet to take stuff, came to the door to call for a patient, but totally ignored our presenced, didnt even bother to ask if she could help in any ways.

I have to go in to the registration counter to ask how can we register and this indian lady at counter told us to wait outside. And I told her we been waiting for very long and no one is there to register us.

The service efficiency/sensitivity, initiative, is definitely missing. And no sense of apologetic when I mentioned we been waiting for so long, presence was ignored. Please kindly improve on your customer service, and efficiency.

Doctor attitude was bad and skimp too. Just briefly asked a few questions, asked hw many days MC den say issue painkillers and muscle relaxant, go back eat, can go already.

Probably the last visit. We dont deserve such service.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112354984106199392951/reviews
Staff Fang Chye Pin,5,"this clinic is full of surprises  - not your typical super bright and clean environment type of clinics but it makes up by having the heart ware - with very friendly, caring and professional staff members who are attentive and try their best to ensure that you are well taken care. I was here twice for settling LPA for myself and my sister, I did not really see the doctor but from what I experienced from his staff members, I know that the ""fruits cannot be too far away from the parent plant"" . The very well-done staff training reflects how the owner and doctor expects and it indirectly showcases the profession on the part of the owner/ doctor. üòõ One more advantage - the price is very affordable compared to the rest of the clinics listed in the Internet.  I paid 24 dollars for this LPA service, nearly half the price of his other competitors... I rest my case. keep it up for trying to provide affordable health are to the commoners staying in this area.
