Andy Tan,1,Rude staff. Ignored us (despite seeing us) when we politely asked how to order. He seems to be very frustrated in trying to fulfil orders and while we understand it‚Äôs understaffed he could have told us where to queue and wait but he just ignored the whole bunch of new customers entirely.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118075704816780052153/reviews
Nur Insyirah (Nisha),2,"cashier who has glasses, seemed to have no hair whos a male, was ABSOLUTELY rude when my husband was telling him his order. My husband did not hear his question which was ""payment by?"" and he rudely interrupted my husband by saying ""PAYMENT BY?"" with a rude expression. Please improve your staff attitude towards customers, this is not kind service towards customers and this indeed quite literally ruined our perfect good day.

"Chan Wai, ÈôàÊüÉÊ±ê",1,"I seldom give any store a one star review, the staff is very poor attitude, there is some problem with the ordering machine and when we asked the staff to take the order, she is like we owe her a living. Anyway, the fries is over priced, load with lots of seasonings but very little fries. I won‚Äôt buy it again for sure",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100289457793824033886/reviews
Rhen cabuga,1,"I‚Äôd like to share some feedback regarding the staff‚Äôs handling of the situation. It appeared that there was a lack of effective customer service, as the interaction escalated unnecessarily. The staff seemed unable to manage the situation calmly and struggled to communicate appropriately with the customer.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104309041529893506616/reviews
