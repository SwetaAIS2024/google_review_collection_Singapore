R H,3,Average food at above average prices. The whole place is empty so that is plus or minus depending on what you want. Pad Thai was wet style. Green curry not very green or taste like usual.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112746153583852444271/reviews

Nurfiyanty Zainuddin,4,"The place was really easy to find and it's clean. The dishes we ordered can be for 4 pax as well but it was just us 2. Green curry chicken, tom yum chicken, egg, jamine rice & popiah. And they were all delicious! Worth the money spent. A little disappointed with the drinks because there were no ice given. But the thai iced tea was good, just lack ice. Because it's the fasting month, they gave dates for us to break fast with. Which was really nice compare to other restaurants.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115300022120649515647/reviews
Rose L,5,"Good food, great value and consistent! I’ve been using food delivery apps for a long time, this restaurant is one of my favorite and is really the best in terms of packaging! Their food always arrived hot and they also always added extra layer of wrapping just to make sure there’s no spillage!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109419261611525696290/reviews
