      "text": "Ah Xiong Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee (One of the open-air food court stalls)\n\nThis is a new stall that moved in during the last 1 month or so. I noticed that there are two stalls of the same name located in the Boon Lay area but I am not sure if this is one of those two that have relocated here.\n\nWe ordered one plate each of Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle, Fried Kway Teow and Black Fried Carrot Cake for lunch. However, I did not find their food that fabulous.\n\nFried Hokkien Prawn Noodle ($5) : Portion is good for a small appetite. Taste is acceptable but needs more stock to enhance the flavor.\n\nFried Kway Teow ($6) : a somewhat disappointing dish as the cockles are way too raw and the dish can defiantly do with more sweet black sauce, more lard and more intense flame while cooking (the dish lacks \"wok hei\")\n\nBlack Fried Carrot Cake ($4.5) : This is the least favorable dish as it is obviously fried for a very short time. The internal of the carrot cake is not hot at all and similar to above, the dish lacks \"wok hei\".\n\nOverall, I could only give a 3 star for their food on the quality aspect. (My guideline are a. 5 star for food with \"Wow!\" factor, b. 4 star for good food that I will revisit (and possible again-and-again), c. 3 star for edible food but I will unlikely to revisit).",
