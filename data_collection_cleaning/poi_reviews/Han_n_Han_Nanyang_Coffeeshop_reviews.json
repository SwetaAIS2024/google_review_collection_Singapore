Curry puff was also filled with potatoes and small piece of egg.  Add on another crispy peanut pancake and another kaya pancake both taste good especially the crispy version.   Cheap and good breakfast.",

      "text": "Nice cosy shop at Jurong East St 24 aka Yuhua Village. Serve traditional Nanyang coffee, tea and other drinks. They also have traditional peanut pancakes in thin or traditional forms. The peanut fillings are Mr Bean type. They also have coconut, red bean, cheese and kaya fillings.\n\nTraditional hot drinks is not complete with half boil eggs or kaya toasts.\n\nFor waffle lovers, they sell waffles topped with ice cream of various favours.\n\nFor the peanut pancake and tea I ordered, it cost $2.60. The coffee or tea at the nearby hawker center is already selling for $1.30 and it's worth drinking from here.\n\nThe curry puffs were not available when I was here and hope to try another day.\n\nLunch time will be crowded and consider taking public transport as Yuhua Village parking is usually crowded.",
