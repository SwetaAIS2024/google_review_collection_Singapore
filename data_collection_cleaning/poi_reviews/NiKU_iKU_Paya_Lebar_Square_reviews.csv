Peter Rock Steady,4,First time trying Niku Iku. Average taste from a typical Japanese take out. Portions are just enough and not for the big eaters.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112735098010851642789/reviews
c lex,4,"Ordered the yakiniku chicken with gobo rice. It was a tasty and good portion size of rice and protein, and grateful that it includes some veg. Having the website ordering is helpful too as the wait can be a bit long.

Note: the packaging is not microwave-safe as indicated, I put it in my microwave without the foil top but it started sparking even under 30secs! (Thankfully I was watching it) Best to transfer it to another dish before reheating.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117982194656701556655/reviews
pauline tan,5,"Good portion, hygienic and tasty. I have been getting the double salmons cooked in both ways many times. A shout out to Wei Hao for his impeccable service and kind patience in explaining the different ways the salmons will be cooked. Thank you! I’ll be back again!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104734434408789466687/reviews
FH,4,Tried the Yakiniku beef with Brussel sprouts. Taste is good but portion is too small.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105984351456008071975/reviews
Andre,2,"Food is honestly decent (very hard to go wrong with yakiniku beef) but the wait is terrible. Arrived at ~ 730pm with no queue, but had to wait a whole 20min for it to cook and collected it at ~750pm.

I personally watched it cook, and the grill clearly has a heating issue. This is yakiniku style beef which typically takes seconds to cook, but somehow it really took a whole 20min to cook…

And the food wasn’t well cooked either. In the 20min I stood in front of the grill I saw salmon sticking to grills when being flipped (grill was not oiled enough) and pumpkins slices being burnt…

For most “grab and go” places people expect food fast. If you’re looking for speed I would not recommend this place.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102335885951377621012/reviews
