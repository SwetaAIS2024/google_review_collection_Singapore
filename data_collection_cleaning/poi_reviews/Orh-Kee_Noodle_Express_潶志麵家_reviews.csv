Fairy,4,"Fish balls and fried tau kee are very nice. The noodle comes with a signature black fish ball.

Meat balls are not bad. Soup tasted ok.

The food centre is very hot even though there are big fans.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110707374703256523409/reviews
Ritz Bitz,5,Had the scallop noodle today. The taste was very good. Also pretty generous with the scallop ingredients. The other items on the menu look quite standard but may be good to try if need a quick and light bite.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110358387947738376597/reviews
Joey C.,4,"Simple and clean meatball soup where the meatballs are quite generous, big and obviously homemade. I thought the taste was quite nice and not salty. They also have other more scrumptious full flavored noodle dishes thatâ€™s definitely worth trying (see menu photo) like laksa and minced meat noodles!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117248916812976885999/reviews
randall,4,Inside the tam chiak kopitiam. Honestly a well made bowl of noodles. Best part was how well they've prepped and cooked the liver. Not livery at all!,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109975281303071622618/reviews
