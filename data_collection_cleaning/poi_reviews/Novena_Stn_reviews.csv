Flo Yeow,3,"The amount of mess all around here is something you'd want to watch out for. It's still a well maintained bus stop, looking at the uncontrollables all around. But just be more mindful when you're transiting here. It's supposed to be right in front of Velocity Mall, but I guess the road conditions have forced them to move to now be in front of Royal Square first, before moving back eventually.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
