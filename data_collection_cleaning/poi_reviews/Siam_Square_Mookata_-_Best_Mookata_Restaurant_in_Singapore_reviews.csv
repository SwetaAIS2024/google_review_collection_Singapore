While the ingredients aren't premium, they are fresh and flavorful, making it a great choice for heartlanders seeking value. The casual ambiance and classic mookata flavors create a perfect spot for gatherings with friends and family.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110777175975209979259/reviews
Jen Chloe,2,"Food:
- fishball were gross. It is obviously frozen with no taste. All i taste is starch.
- first time i see meat served with so much liquid. Although the taste of the meat is not too bad. But i cannot look beyond the “meats with loads of water” that was served.
- Soup is pretty nice BUT i think it has alot of MSG as me and my friends felt very thirsty after the meal.

Miscellaneous:
- Weird policy that you cannot join 2 tables together. Note that all they have are small round tables outside.
- I asked the staff why the meat was so watery, all she replied was “sorry i dont know”.

Definitely one of the pricer mookata where price cannot justify the food quality. It will be my first and sadly the last time patronising.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106586992350154218175/reviews
Ng Jackaroo,1,"**Rating: ★☆☆☆☆**

We recently visited Siam Square Mookata and were extremely disappointed with the service. The grill we were given was clearly not hot enough, making it impossible to cook our meat properly. When we raised the issue with the uncle managing the place, he simply brushed us off, saying that the heat was sufficient and there was nothing he could do about it.

Despite our feedback, he didn't offer any assistance or solution, leaving us struggling to cook our food. It took over 10 minutes just to cook a single piece of meat, and even then, it wasn't fully done. The entire experience was frustrating and uncomfortable, as we had to fight with the grill just to eat.

Overall, it was a very disappointing experience, and I would not recommend this place to others.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101595641932624333387/reviews
GT,1,"I used to be a regular but not anymore. The heat was so low that the soup was not boiling, it took 1hour plus for the soup to start boiling and we had to pack away the vegetables and mushrooms we ordered as it was impossible for it to be cooked. The meat was marinated well but I don't think the price was worth it. $43 for two pax and the low heat made the dining experience absolutely horrendous.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108792121903018829550/reviews
Su Mon,1,"Overall bad especially the price is much expensive than the service and foods they offer. And some of the items that they announce on their website buffet menu are not available. Not only the meat are not fresh but also we are not allowed to try every items on the menu.Although the website says that they have ice cream for dessert, only few branch contains ice cream dessert but the price for the buffet is the same for all branch. With this amount of price you can get a lot better mookata in other places.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111131328675416068787/reviews
