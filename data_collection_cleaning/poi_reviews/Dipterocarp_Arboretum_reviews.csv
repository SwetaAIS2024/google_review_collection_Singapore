Chris Wardle,5,"Another cool surprise found at Yishun Park, in Singapore‚Äôs Northeast ‚Äì remnants of an ancient rainforest survive and thrive in this unusually large, cool, shady Dipterocarp Arboretum. Sited in the midst of of a housing estate, this is an ‚Äúoff the beaten track‚Äù gem, well worth searching out.

Oh, and don't let the images of large buttress and surface roots put you off. Like much of Singapore, this haven of greenery has smooth, wide bitumen paths suitable for strollers, wheelchairs, pedestrians, and cyclists alike ‚Äì and some gentle rises for the runners..

Come mindfully, meditate, and enjoy the silence, and the song of the forest.
