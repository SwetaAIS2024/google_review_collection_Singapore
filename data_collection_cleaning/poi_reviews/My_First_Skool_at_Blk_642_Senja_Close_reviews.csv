Rie Huang,2,N1 Very often HFMD. N2 sometimes. With spread of 8-9 students each wave. Unsure of actual sanitary condition or health check leniency. Curriculum is ok. Good field trip places. Depends on what you want for your child in their important years of growing up. You can pay the same for other centres with more facilities.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105949012761277326200/reviews
