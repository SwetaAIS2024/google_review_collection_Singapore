Em Tan,4,"To benefit others, this is a cloud kitchen so there is no physical stall.
Pick up take away from the lift lobby.

The flavours of the mutton briyani is pretty good but I don't feel that it is worth a whopping 15 dollars.

Also 3 masala chicken wings costing sgd 8 is a lil too pricey. Somehow feel that the marinate is only on the surface and not infused into the meat.

Overall good for a dish made by home cooks.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110196350685755495062/reviews

Sunny Ahmed,5,"Having eaten a lot of gravy based Biryani's at Singapore, I was craving the real authentic dum type biryani with masalas that tingles my taste buds.
For the price it is a hidden gem in Singapore. I can hands down say it is the best Biryani in Singapore.
We liked it so much that we ended up ordering in bulk for the weekend. It took me back to my childhood days in Mumbai when we would have this delicious home made biryani that would punch you in the face with the perfect blend of spices.
This muslim owned biryani food delivery is something that is authentic and different.
We ended the meal with their perfectly balanced kulfi which is often described as ""traditional Indian ice cream.""  It was a really nice afternoon meal filled with happiness and a taste to remember that might probably be the best Biryani in Singapore.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107367413949554888751/reviews
