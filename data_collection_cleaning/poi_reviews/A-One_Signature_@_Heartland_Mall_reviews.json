The staff were all polite, friendly, and patient, which made the atmosphere even more enjoyable. The food itself tasted very fresh and delicious. I would definitely love to come back again!",

      "text": "The tofu was fairly quite enjoyable. However, the beancurd skin prawn could use some refinement, as the portion size of the beancurd skin prawn seemed quite small compared to the vegetables. The fish soup was a bit on the salty and oily side, with a slight hint of reused oil. As for the noodles, they reminded me of a local zi char style, which was decent but could be elevated further. The porridge was not too bad. Overall, there’s potential for improvement, and I look forward to seeing how the dishes evolve!",

We were greeted with a warm and friendly experience not to mention it was clean and comfortable which is perfect for a relaxing meal.\n\nMenu has tons of options and I went with lobsters of their current promotion which are affordable and fresh! I also tried their signature claypot rice which did not disappoint as well. Definitely impressive\n\nWould recommend for a tasty meal. Great food , service and atmosphere. Will definitely be coming back.",
