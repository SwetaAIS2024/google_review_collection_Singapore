The teachers and admin staff are kind, patient and caring, one amazing part is that they can remember the names of all the kids in the school accurately. The school has its own kitchen with amazing chefs, my kid loves the food there and even ask me to get the recipe and make it at home. Personally I'm very happy with the school and my kid also enjoys the time at school.",

I was specially happy to see that Odyssey is doing all possible to adjust my son´s diet according to the restrictions that he has (gluten free and dairy free) without making him fell like he is different. Potty traininh has been a challenge for us, but the teachers are helping a lot in this process. We couldn´t be happier with our experience!",

There’s also a water play area and well-equipped art and music rooms. The school kitchen is helmed by awesome Chef Khaled who prepares tasty and nutritious food on-site for the children. Last but not least, there’s a great team of dedicated and friendly teaching staff taking care of the children.",
