The staff were incredibly friendly, making us feel right at home from the moment we walked in. The cozy ambiance, paired with the exceptional service, created a perfect setting for an enjoyable and memorable dining experience.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105425755192891895389/reviews

Lhukiezz,4,"My 2nd time at Red Coliseum the ambiance was perfect. The food was absolutely scrumptious, especially the Burger pizza, pasta, and nachos; the red wine champagne cocktails were superb, and the service was admirable, except for one staff member. This gentleman was kind of rude and nonchalant. There was a customer who wanted to apologize bcuz they backed out last minute, so this customer approached this gentleman politely; however, he just walked away and ignored him. Please take care of how your employees interact with the customers. The live band is superb.üëç Notwithstanding the early experience we had. The singer singing yesterday, I assume she was doing rehearsal; has a beautiful voice; however, she was deafening‚Äîit's a pain for the ears to listen to her yesterday.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105128769837974605069/reviews
