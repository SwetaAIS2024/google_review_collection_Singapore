epscag,5,"Recently I  visited this new shop and had a fantastic experience! Aside from their manicure and pedicure services, they also offer amazing facials. I tried the Oxycell Timeless System facial and their acne treatment, and my skin feels so much clearer and refreshed. They use a brand called Quarz, and it really worked wonders for my skin. The staff were super friendly and the prices are reasonable. If you’re looking for a one-stop shop for nails and skincare, definitely give this shop a try.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118136015833773982736/reviews

Very nice atmosphere, clean and relaxation place.
First try for the oxycell timeless, it's amazing..I'm very happy with the result. My skin look growing and radiance even just a first trial treatment.
