Ann Dee Choong,5,"The place is new and nice, new hype with new merchandise stall, franchises come here to grow their business

There’s a Cold Storage here.

Parking is ample.

Prices wise here don’t expect cheap, more to cafe prices.

Went to PPP cafe I think. Food and coffee is okay.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100450093195872023769/reviews
Kamonkarn K,5,"A new and charming concept

New bahru was previously a school that has been left doing nothing for a few years.

Lo and behold group, a recognized F&B lifestyle developer decided to turn this into a F&B and retail destination. I saw a similar concept in Hong Kong but honestly, I prefer this one in singapore given decent shops the place managed to consolidate.

There are restaurants, brunch places, coffee places, cold storage, retail and yoga classes. Definitely worth checking this place out.

Note : parking is limited and can be hard to secure during weekend",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118113168032246100272/reviews
jennita nita (Jejenjourney),5,"New Bahru is such a unique spot! Located in an old school building, it really brings back memories of school days. There are lots of nice stores, art studios, and few of food options, plus a supermarket. The outdoor spaces are great for hanging out with kids and pets. Just a heads up—it's probably best to visit on a sunny day since the outdoor areas wouldn’t be as enjoyable in the rain.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111565668904003124106/reviews
