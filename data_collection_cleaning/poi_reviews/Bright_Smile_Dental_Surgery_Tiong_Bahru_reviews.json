He was very careful, patience and explained every step in details so that you knew what was going on and what to be expected. I could see that he put in effort to make the whole treatment process as painless as possible. I strongly recommend his service.",

      "text": "Saw Dr Du. The cleaning was expensive snd the most painful cleaning I have felt. It has also caused me teeth sensitivity to air and sometimes water even after more than a month has passed. I didn’t have any sensitivity problems before, even after doing cleaning elsewhere.\n\nAlso, I had a very occasional slight pain on one of my teeth 1 out of say 20 times that I ate. I regret bringing it up. The dentist got me to bite down on a metal rod and grind my teeth left and right to identity the pain spot. I wonder if that caused more damage as immediately after the visit and until now, that tooth has slight pain EVERY single time I eat. Not trying to be mean but sharing honestly for others who read reviews to consider. Pls go elsewhere.",
