      "text": "The mall has a ton of high end branded names such as Carolina Herrera, VERSACE, Adidas, Swatch, Gucci, and more. There are also restaurants and a food court but since the area is prime the prices are higher than other locations. The lay-out especially near the higher floors is quite impressive.\n\nLocation is honestly great near multiple MRT entrances/exits, bus stops, car pick up areas, and it’s right next to this big walking area which is used for jogging/running/biking, and more. It’s seriously a super long area so if you’re biking I’d recommend visiting.",

Some glass doors open automatically. The parking is pretty crowded. From the balcony you can also see the Merlion. But the most important thing is the service, cleanliness, ambience and safety. Keep up the nice work!",
