TAN KENG TIONG,5,"I had a great experience with Dr Yong during my Healthier SG consultation. He was extremely caring, kind, patient, and attentive as I shared my medical history. He provided clear, reassuring guidance and practical steps for improving my health. I’m very grateful to him and the team, and I’ll definitely return if I need further consultation.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118389160866606118518/reviews
Cherry Oon,1,"I understand that delays can happen, but my recent visit left me a bit unsettled. I registered at 6:45 pm and didn’t finish until 8:40 pm—waiting over 1.5 hours even though only 7 or 8 patients were ahead of me. As someone who was unwell, I was hoping for a bit more consideration during the wait. I also noticed that patients were sometimes seen out of order, which might have contributed to the delay. I hope the clinic can review its process to better support those who are not feeling their best. Overall, the slow pace and lack of consideration made for a very frustrating visit.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108894804170395921060/reviews
Eunice T,5,"Waiting time at OneCare Bishan was reasonable on a Saturday morning. Managed to see the doctor and collected prescribed medication within an hour. Dr Wong Kia Boon was professional, patient and clear in explaining the condition and options, and the staff at front desk were approachable and pleasant. Clinic is new and bright, and the toilet is clean and well-maintained!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101299085989784001125/reviews
Jessica Lin,5,"Dr Yong is very nice and medicines prescribed works wonder for me and my family ! The receptionist are all nice esp Siti! She remembers I have a baby and despite needing to wait for some govt claim which takes ages, she was flexible for me to leave first and if needed to pay for any outstanding payment , they can arrange paynow options for me. Love the flexibility! Thank you!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113240286118018411917/reviews
Jia Jin Lee,1,"I booked a vaccination appointment through gov.sg for 9:15am, and it's stated that I should expect a 15-30 min wait. I registered at the clinic at 9:05am and eventually I was only called in at 10:05am. What a long wait. It also defeats the purpose of a prescheduled appointment?",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103066039005946946619/reviews
