Sanjeet Singh,1,"Ordered Tom Yum soup, hotplate tofu and other dishes for 3 people. After pay when order, we are told self collect the dishes to our table. Sizzling hot plate and hot soup. When questioned, the lady just walked away without answering. I'm shocked with their service. Never was like that. If only there was a minus star for their service.

They just lost another loyal customer.

Greg Tay,5,Halal Chinese tze char seafood style. Very very delicious. Better than most regular tze char stalls. Highly recommended. It's in a coffeeshop with nicer atmosphere. Cooling as well so it's a comfortable eating experience.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106016485464677542301/reviews
James Xie,3,"ordered item no.1 sliced fish with onion and ginger rice.

Waiting time was short as there wasn't much people. portion is normal.

Taste is pretty good with thick sauce. Rice was well cooked. Will visit again to try other items.
