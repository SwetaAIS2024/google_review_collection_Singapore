Gio K,4,A free but entertaining walk way for family. There's information on the respective dinosaurs but the walk way is abit narrow so you will have to wait for people to pass if you want to take a good picture.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104895825387951127739/reviews
DaX Toh,5,"Manageable and reasonably short pathway for walking or cycling with the kids. Dinosaur exhibits are pretty well done, realistic to some extent and nice experience overall. No longer as crowded as when it first opened which is good as the path is quite narrow. We decided to cycle from Jurassic mile to ECP McDonald‚Äôs for lunch before cycling back.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110795556109846185546/reviews

Yogesh Krish,4,"Fun Outdoor experience, especially for kids. The life sized dinosaur displays are impressive and great for both kids ans adults. Have plenty of photo spots, well maintained, and great outdoor activity. To explore the whole Jurassic Mile, you have to walk a long distance up and down, so come prepared for that journey, or cycle along the route.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103463281472082775524/reviews
