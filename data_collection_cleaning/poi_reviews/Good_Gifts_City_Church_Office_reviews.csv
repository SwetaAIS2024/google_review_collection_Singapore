Alan Goh,5,"Thankful for brother Alex and his ministry team's visit today. We are grateful for your prayers and encouragement for our family.

By God's grace, it was your recent powerful testimony of deliverance, at our church service, that led us to reach out to you. Thankful that you said yes to us in a heartbeat, even though we haven't met.

My son Isaac loves the little gifts. It's a very sweet gesture. Thank you sister Judy, and Pauline. We're grateful for your kindness.

Thank you and God bless!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108641408117451890671/reviews
