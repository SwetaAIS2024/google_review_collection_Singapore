Michelle,1,Definitely not your usual Starbucks where the staffs are too busy and can’t be bother with good service. The lady taking order frowned and impatiently responded when I tried to redeem a voucher. Requested for another fork as it came wet and stained was another bad experience! Strawberry Mochi Blossom Pure Matcha Latte? Can’t taste the matcha at all and in fact it’s a diluted funny taste; green colored milk drink! I usually can’t be bothered to leave a bad review unless absolutely necessary! Good luck to everyone who expects friendly barista and good customers service from this outlet.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106405413234220133793/reviews

Kally Teo,4,"Only two baristas when I arrived at 1pm 26th December 2024 and they seemed a bit shorthanded, thus they seem to be in a panic mode.
Pleasantly surprised that there are power sockets available on the second floor, though I am unsure if they work. The location was about 10% filled with people; a good place to work.
Crowd came in at 3pm and it was fully packed.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106420099871084196082/reviews
Lilo Stitch,3,"A very cozy, comfortable and lots of seats on the upper level.The aircon is good too. Place is always keep neat and tidy.However,the barista is not doing a good job as the coffee is not that good too bland,not strong enough.I can say very tasteless sorry to say that,and its so dissappointing.The cakes are good as its during the xmas season so all the cakes are so cutes and taste good too.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116880572725888150872/reviews
Dru Lu,4,It’s a Starbucks. Got surprisingly a lot of seatings. The place got a lot of clutters of garbage because people don’t bring their trash to trash can and the employees don’t bus as often as they should. Otherwise a great place to rest your feet after a long shopping spree.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115927493800245457440/reviews
