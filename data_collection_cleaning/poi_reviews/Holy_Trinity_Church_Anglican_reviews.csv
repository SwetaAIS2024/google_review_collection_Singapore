Meng Fai Yip,4,"Holy Trinity Church is an Anglican church which has an interesting history and architectural design. To get to Holy Trinity Church, take the MRT train to Lavender MRT Station, exit through Exit B of the station, and walk along Horne Road until you reach the end of the road. There is a plaque nearby which tells you of the history of the church.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238839349859158213/reviews
