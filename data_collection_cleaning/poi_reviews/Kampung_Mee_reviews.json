The fishballs are slightly too fishy for my liking.\n\nI came at 1700 and there was no crowd. The home-made barley was the best of the food items.\n\nThe place is newly opened and everything is clean, neat, and tidy.\n\nI would recommend my friends and family to try this place at least once.",

      "text": "First of all service is extremely bad, and the quality is the worst ever. We got insects in the food twice. Once is the drink and once is the soup which extremely not hygienic and extremely disgusting plus nobody even apologized for that or said anything. Not only that but the table was sticky that the plate sticks to the table, like actually stick not a joke. So we couldnâ€™t even eat the food after the insects and the plate spilled because of that and nobody cares from waiters or want to help or what to apologize for that too so not only the food but atmosphere too. Thats away from the food was cold and smelled so fishy and salty and there was no fish in it. After all of that when I sag where is the manager for all of this, he says there is no manager, where is the boss respond with there is no boss. And I paid for all of this stuff at the end. The worst service, worst hygiene, worst management I have seen till now. Not recommended at all, see this restaurant and wake the other way.",
