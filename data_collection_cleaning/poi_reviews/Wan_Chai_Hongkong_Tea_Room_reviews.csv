Sean Poon,1,"I came after 3pm and craving for wanton noodle. I pop into the Wanchai Hong Kong tearoom. Ordered 1 dry noodle and 1 soup noodle. The broth is naturally sweet but not flavourful. The dark colour broth can be deceivingly looking appetising. Noodle is springy and cooked al dente, and wanton is plump with a piece of medium-sized whole prawn, lack juiciness though. Both dry and soupversions ares equally savoury enough. There is  no need for further condiments except some preserved green cut chillies. The coffee is good, but the yuan yang a bit diluted to our taste. The kaya toast is average, not toasty enough, and bread is chewy. Overall, the food could have served even warmer/hotter to uplift the diner appetite. There are many food choices in IMM. You may want to browse through before deciding if you want to try at this tearoom.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104302598059978578735/reviews
Lydia Tio,4,"Sliced beef crispy noodle was nice, light and crispy. Sauce was smooth and silky. Tomato cheese baked rice on smaller side than expected, taste was allright, though I really enjoyed the soup that came with it a lot.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109953792528295741665/reviews
Denise Ong,4,"Fill in the chit with your orders and pay at cashier. Food will be served to you afterwards.

Got 6 pcs of chicken wings for 4 pax. Their chicken wings are tasty when served hot.

Got the HK Milk Tea and Yuan Yang. Yuan Yang is better suited for breakfast hours if you‚Äôre caffeine sensitive üòÖ Milk tea was nice. Bolo bun went nicely with the drinks.

Tried their fried rice, it‚Äôs filling but too salty for my liking. The fried rice comes with ABC soup.

The mango pomelo dessert was not bad. Went to their pick up counter to ask for the dessert after we were done with the mains.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105885270396733702572/reviews
ÊÅ©Áê¶,5,"Not sure why the -ve reviews. Personally really loved how attentive the staff were! Went for dinner.

The staff checked in ywice if I needed chilli for the ÊªëËõãÊ≤≥Á≤â! Ingredients were fresh, hor fun not too salty! Everything for this dish was just right I LOVED IT. The chef deserves a raise! I had to order one without meat, and was pleasantly surprised to see that more vegetables were added without me asking. I tried the milk tea for the first time today and liked it a lot too!!!!

I dream about this wa dan hor everyday and now I will dream about their milk tea too hehe.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117949435653709324037/reviews
AC Chan,5,"Returned to Wan Chai Hongkong Tea Room for THIS after spying it on almost every diners‚Äô tables last weekend. This three-piece har cheong gai [a.k.a. prawn paste chicken] are very yummy! üòã
They are fried perfectly with an ultra-crispy texture; and give an intense, distinct fragrant and flavour when I sink my teeth into the chunky wings. I‚Äôll definitely be thinking and drooling over it in the next few days. ü§§",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
