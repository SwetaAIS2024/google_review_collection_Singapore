S K Yeo,5,"Patronised this stall for many many years!  One of the best Mee Siam in this area.  Itâ€™s the same Chinese Uncle in the morning!   Very Savoury Gravy.   Prices have increased, but I am still coming back as I love the gravy, the crushed peanuts and the Gu Cai (chives).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116299564898036970468/reviews
è‹¥ä¹… æ˜¥ç”Ÿ,4,"Simple basic mee Siam. $3.50.  Open almost 24 hours.

Not too spicy. I dun like Mee Siam that has some sweetness in the gravy. This stall version is savoury assam and  bit sour. This mee siam comes with gu cai. Can ask for extra or none depending  on personal  preferences. There's a side scoup  of Chilli paste at the side.

Also serves some nice varieties of nonya kuey some days.

The day stall is the one with the bao steamer next to it and served by an mature uncle or a Chinese lady.

Towards  evening, the mee siam is sold besides the wonton mee stall and just in front of the Chinese rojak stall.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110549081394545029621/reviews
