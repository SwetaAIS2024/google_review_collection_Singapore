M K,1,This is not a pharmacy - there is no pharmacist available. I wasted time walking here while unwell just to be told it wasn’t a pharmacy - don’t go if you need medical assistance.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118017722031003750009/reviews
Chris H,1,"Male Pharmacist with glasses and big ears 招风耳先生 doesn't like his job, grumpy and impatient when I had questions. Maybe Guardian should pay him much higher salary like 200k or more per year, so he can treat customers with better attitude.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104453563498846032433/reviews

Shawn Lee,1,"Worst pharmacist ever. Basically I can’t find the paracetamol because it was crowded at the medication section, so I went to ask him at the pharmacist’s counter. He regards everyone with contempt. If he hates his job he should quit. A stain to the service standards of all healthcare professionals. I would give a 0 but that’s not possible, so I give you a 1.

To add, he doesn’t wear his mask properly, only wears it by hanging it on his spectacle frames.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110863227773920951500/reviews
