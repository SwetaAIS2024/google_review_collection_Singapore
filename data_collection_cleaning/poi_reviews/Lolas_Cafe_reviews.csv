TzePing Yeoh,5,"Reservation recommended for weekends & holidays to avoid long waiting time. Outdoor seats are pet-friendly although can be very hot depends on the weather. Food is yummy, coffee is good too. The shop itself gets really busy during peak hours so brace yourself for that.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108051630680234147648/reviews
johnnykuochung,4,"Off Day Well Spent at Lola’s, Kovan
Took the day off, and instead of sleeping in, I made my way to Lola’s at Kovan not just for the food, but for the vibe... and yes, to see the friendly (and very pretty) staff I’ve heard about.
Been seeing this place pop up on Chris’s feed, so I had to check it out myself. I ordered the Miso Salmon Grain Bowl, and wow every bite felt like a little reset. The miso-glazed salmon was tender and flavourful, resting on a bed of fluffy quinoa. The charred baby corn brought a smoky crunch, and the avocado added that creamy contrast I didn’t know I needed. A perfectly jammy hanjuku egg, a dash of furikake, and that nutty roasted sesame dressing tied it all together.
Washed it down with a hot matcha latte except… it came out warm. Big sad. But you know what? That was the only miss in an otherwise stellar meal.
Sometimes all you need is a good bowl, good energy, and a smile from the staff to make your day. No regrets, only recharges.

Joseph Lum,4,"First time try. Heard about it and decided to check it out. The food was indeed delicious and I enjoyed it. Thankfully my family shared the food among ourselves, as each main course dish was “too much” for a person. In particular, the bread and the stew complemented each other perfectly. The pasta was too “truffle” though. Overall, the dinner was nice, including the good customer service from the staff who served us.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102305199551853057851/reviews
CF Chai,5,"Always like Lola's food. The price is on the steep side for a cafe but the dishes are delicious in general. It usually have a long wait during weekend but weekday night is ok. The plating of the dishes are nice. The servers are friendly and smiley, but can still be more attentive. A few servers were chatting beside us and and need us to signal vigorous to notice us trying to catch their attention for sharing plates.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111678080780719700310/reviews
les wong,5,I’ve been craving for a nice avocado toast and hot cappuccino. Was surprised that online reservation gets filled up fast and booked for next weekend. Lola’s cafe didnt disappoint. Coffee has nice blend. Toast is perfectly done with 2 eggs and pulled pork. Place can get a bit noisy.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104359968882324581490/reviews
