jitsern sia,5,"This laksa dazzles with a creamy, spice-laced coconut broth, tender rice noodles, plump prawns, and fresh herbs, delivering comforting heat and fragrant depth in every slurp.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107038336285981124887/reviews
Low Bao Heng,4,"Tried this OK Chicken Rice at their other outlets before. Glad to see that it‚Äôs here in Punggol, so near to where I stay. Halal, so more options for Muslim neighbours. üëçüèº

Tried a few of the items on their menu since its opening and enjoyed some discounts. Such as the Lemon Cutlet Chicken, Roasted Chicken Rice, 1/2 Steamed Chicken and even chicken laksa for a few time.

Overall strongly recommended. It‚Äôs nice. Just find their soup taste weird.. üòÖ and the service can be better as one time clear instruction given no bean sprout for chicken laksa but end up upon reaching home disappointed that there are bean sprout. üò•

F&B is not easy. Other than good food, reasonable pricing, customer service also must be up to standard. If not consumer will support less and eventually due to low sales and high rental cost, will have to move out just like how previous western food stall didn‚Äôt survive long.

So, Keep it up! üí™üèª",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108033403024309465290/reviews
Chong KV,3,"Mar'25. Price slightly on high side but they do have discount for members. I tried the chicken rice, it taste normal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114047288472149349381/reviews
Low Allain,5,"I recently visited a new stall and tried their prawn laksa and hum laksa, and I was thoroughly impressed! The prawn laksa had a rich, aromatic broth that perfectly balanced spices and coconut milk, making each sip comforting and satisfying. The prawns were fresh and cooked to perfection, adding a delightful sweetness.

The hum laksa was equally amazing, featuring tender cockles that added a unique brininess to the dish. The broth was just as flavorful, and the combination of noodles and toppings made for a hearty meal.

Overall, the stall offers a fantastic experience with generous portions and vibrant flavors. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes! Highly recommend for laksa lovers!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116822204857458831004/reviews
Chris T,3,"Hum laksa is nice and well flavoured. Only comes with 3 hum as shown in the stall photo, therefore not humfull. Would be great if it has more. $5 a bowl with chicken cutlet at $7 for a full piece.

They provide disposable cutlery, which is more toxic.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101649473283894655097/reviews
