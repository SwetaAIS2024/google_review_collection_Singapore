      "text": "Very generous with the amount of egg and shrimps. For $6.50 egg fried rice with shrimps, the portion is sizable. Whilst it cannot claim to have every grain coated with egg, the fluffy grains were well separated from each other, evidence of thorough frying of overnight left over rice.\n\nVery nice. Must return to try their other items especially the spicy wantan noodle.",
