Saifu Angto,4,"Glad to find drink stalls after a walk in a hot afternoon.  So many selections, but stick to the basic cendol drink.  Reasonable price, $2 for good size.  Not too sweet, and the smaller cendol sipped through the normal size straw.  Happy with the purchase.

Will try other drinks in the future.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
V L,5,"Our first time here at Empress Market Hawker Center,  the hawkers and cleaners were all so friendly and helpful that my friends and I each has such good experiences with them.
One of them is this Teh Tarik drink stall.  The boss was so smiley and nice and offer to serve the 3 drinks to our table for me.  We ordered the less sweet teh tarik, it was really good.  Will be back..",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104166490450113806995/reviews
