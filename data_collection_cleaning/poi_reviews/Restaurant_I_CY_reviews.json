      "text": "Come to THAI FOOD!\nFound the best Thai food and we drove all the way from horizon hills to pick up dinner here....Owned by a couple, place looks so clean, so tasty, not too salty, full of flavour.\nTheir mince basil fried rice is exactly the same as Bangkok with huge portion and delicately soft yolk fried egg.\nTom yum soup portion is huge with lots veges and chicken. The precious thing is even the chicken doesn't taste frozen. Pineapple fried rice looks so fluffy, without any dark colour or overly poured oil.\n\nEco botanic Thai food should come here and learn what is called Thai food!",

The boss really put a lot of efforts into making it in this business.\nThe soup he made always flavourful, you can found different ingredients in the soup. Which is a good thing, and not just salt and water.\nThe meat portion always outweighs the rice. Which I had to order extra rice just to eat the left over meats.\nOverall, eating at his stall, is always a happy experience for me.",

Highly recommended for a late night snack and all food and drinks exceeded expectations and just tasted \"right\". Highly recommend the Rock Small Fry stall, tucked in the back next to the drinks counter.",

There's mala xiang guo, chicken wings, satay, tze char etc. We ordered tze char this time.\n\nThe wanton noodle, bbq chicken wings & satay close at 2.30am. However u still get those toast bread etc from the coffee stall.\n\nFood was quite good at super afforable price. Especially the fried ikan bilis with onions (RM15) with a tad spice! They do sell beer if u like some.\n\nCleanliness was ok. There's indoor & outdoor seatings available. Take outdoors if u would like to watch TV. Quite a relax place to have supper late night.",
