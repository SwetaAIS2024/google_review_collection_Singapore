Lilie Hartono,2,"The food is okay..just wanted to give feedback to Kimly Coffeeshop to use more eco friendly cup. Don't need to give cover if the customers drink there. May as well reduce the price of your drinks instead of giving the customer a cup with unnecessary plastic cover. I told the drink stall aunty that I don't need the cover, but she still give me the cover. I told her to remove and can use for the next customer. But she opened the small cover and put straw in. It's a waste of plastic.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105495924279577731617/reviews
kc lee,3,"Multiple food stalls options here. Most are decent. The coffeeshop drink stall (Kimly) is not very environmentally friendly. They are using disposable plastic cups. When we tols them dont need to waste the good quality on-use cover since we are dining in, the worker says all drinks must have cover. Claimed their boss will scold them if they dont provide it. Shocking!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106924913730672678356/reviews

CK C,1,Teh siu dai was very expensive at $1.40 but yet tasted very bad - too sweet and milky with not much tea taste. No runners to take orders. Cleaners were also lazy and not proactive in cleaning the tables.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
