M LYZ,5,"Efficient and effective! From enquiry , booking, to getting this fixed.
Just had my oven tripping issue fixed at a reasonable price.
Really great customer service as well, easy to follow up over phone and whatsapp.
Technician Hang was professional, and explained very clearly the steps and what to expect.
And the fact that there’s a 1 year warranty to this gives me a peace of mind.
Hopefully no more appliances breakdown but if there is, I’ll engage Yeobuild again !",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108649401037162906480/reviews
AQ,5,"Impressed with the service provided by Zac and his team. Had an issue with my dryer and had to call for assistance. This company responded and confirmed the date and time of visit efficiently and clearly.

Technician Zac came within the time frame and within a few minutes of accessing the dryer, he told us the issue of the broken rubber strip and how much it would cost for the replacement. He then fixed it and all was good to go! $60 consultation and $190 3-parts replacement costs (excluding GST). Payment done via QR code. Received invoice via email. Smoothly done!

Very pleased and impressed with the service! What a relief that we didn’t have to buy a new dryer!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115224293263750624998/reviews
C Gan,5,"First time hiring Yeobuild to assist with my gas cooker, which did a surprise power trip before dawn. They managed to arrange for a technician to come on the same day in the afternoon. Our technician's name is Louis Liew and he was personable and patient. He told me that it was most probably it is due to a faulty transformer. He checked and replaced the transformer very quickly, and helped cleared some of the debris around the gas burner. It was a painless and efficient experience. Recommend that you call them if you need repairs to your gas cooker.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103699630654870532747/reviews
Bhavya Purswani,1,A very poor experience. The team was well informed the issue. they come for a 5 min walk and look around the LG washing machine which is a smart device. Say the same thing that its needs repair and please pay me 60$. Also we will charge you 300$$!!! to take you machine to warehouse and repair it. God help us with this poor customer servicing.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107045615539077052258/reviews
Vernon Sim,5,My blast chiller hinge came off during my house move and I found Yeobuild online. I sent Eileen a picture and she was upfront with the charges and help me get an appointment the very next day. The service guy put it back without having to replace anything and taught me how to remove the door should I need to in future. Thank you so much for the friendly and speedy service! I will definitely recommend this company.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102050765838893020628/reviews
