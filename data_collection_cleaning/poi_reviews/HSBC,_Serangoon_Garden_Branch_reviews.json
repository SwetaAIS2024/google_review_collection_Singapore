Though I didn’t like the long wait, but I appreciate the heads up.\n\nThen I was served by Angeline to open the account. Angeline was professional and genuinely nice. Enjoyed the little conversations we had while waiting for the bank’s software to load. She answered my questions clearly.\n\nDespite the waiting time, it was a great experience.",

Totally waste of time.",

When it was finally my turn, the counter staff (only 1 was working) told me that if I want to make a deposit (to my own account), I have to have a physical letter stating where my cash came from! She could not reveal what is the minimal amount. When I asked her if I can deposit $100, she told me that I still have to have a letter stating the source of the cash. Yes, ridiculous, isn’t it?!\n\nSo I head to the ATM to make a deposit. Only $2000 is allowed!\n\nI went back in, took another number to open another bank account. I ran out of time because of an appointment. So I left… and dealt with another bank which was much better but known to have weak security protocols.",
