SG Food Travel,5,There are 2 signature dishes: minced meat noodle (Set 1 $5) and grilled pork liver (Set 3 $6). You can tell them to add sambal and extra spicy during ordering.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111338621032926493421/reviews
Darren,4,"Usually frequent this place for their bak Chor mee (they cook the pork livers to perfection!) but decided to try the laksa ($5) this time. Thick and lemak gravy, and the portion is decent too. Just eggs, taugeh, taupok, and cockles together with the noodles though.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews
HAHD,1,"terrible experience with the taller cook. think he is in charge of the midnight shift? he almost forgot to include noodles & totally forgot about vinegary chilli sauce for liver. I was the only customer there

Not once, but many times, he had shown no patience for listening to orders as mine had few big ones sometimes and then got the orders wrong

Last point, heâ€™s a terrible cook as well. Ordered dry noodles, he still cooked them itâ€™s like soup noodles, I might as well ordered soup variation in the first place? Where got people filled the vinegar and chill sauce almost to the brim? The noodles were so soggy!

Donâ€™t even know why is he even hired ðŸ˜’ not the first time seeing customers leaving unfinished bowls behind and bad ratings on food delivery platforms. The shorter guy in the day cooked better",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101882691277789618599/reviews
Kenny Doritos,2,Price is a little steep for the portion. Noodles/ ingredients tastes average at best. But good that they operate till rather late.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100925133455196439262/reviews
