Tony Chua,1,"The milk tea is ordinary, not fragrant and not tasty🥺I asked for pearls but they didn't put them in the milk tea (I don't know if they didn't put them in or what🤦‍♂️)

The coffee from C family mart is better

The portion of Fruit tart & Cup Cake is small

The selection in the store is very limited, the items you want to order from the menu are not there (disappointed😞) I don't feel like coming back for the second time🥺

Summer Snow on the Hillside was also a small business at the beginning, but it can be done well.

I spent RM28.10 and didn't feel full at all. Magical",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116737387003178487164/reviews
Angela Liu,1,"A very ordinary cake that doesn’t require any skills at all
And it’s very sweet and not delicious.
I came around 12 noon and there was no cake.
Not recommended!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117898905044596912782/reviews
