It was in the morning, me and my roommates decided to take a stroll in order to sightseeing the city and discover MarinaBay.\n\nWhen reached here, I couldn’t picture the landscape here will be gorgeous as Western Countries as we see on the Internet!\n\nI can see the full view of high buildings from here. Local people is really hospitable and into taking excersise!!\n\nIf someone in Asea do want to travel a country, definitely I will recommend Singapore and Việt Nam",

There are a lot of trees lining the path and it's a popular place for cyclists, joggers and runners. You can easily have lunch in the CBD or go for a spot of shopping in the Marina Bay Sands from this park.",
