Ts. Dr. Roozita Maskun,5,"I found this cafe at TikTok. Went there for breakfast in the morning. Open early as 8.00am. Menu ordering by apps, a bit lazy to order online, even though you‚Äôre in the cafe.. what to do.. just order..

Many kuih, many drinks, many options of food. Not cheap, not expensive.. just moderate.. you can cash / card / online to pay.

Harman Harison,5,"A variety of authentic Malay food. Nasi lemak is good but the sambal is a bit too sweet for me. Might be okay with most people.

The kampung fried rice is just nice with crispy anchovies and vegie.

The are assortments of Malay delicacies/ kuih that looks tempting. Will try these next time.

A great place for breakfast.

Highly recommended!",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100447961201731726488/reviews
