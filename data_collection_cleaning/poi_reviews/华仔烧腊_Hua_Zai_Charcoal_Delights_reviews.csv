S L,1,Way way too much fat for both char siew and roast meat takeaways on two recent occasions when purchasing from this stall. Pls check before you pay and take away.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111316266362121177513/reviews
Haoyi Li,5,"Had the ‰∏âÂÆùÈù¢, without the È∫ªËæ£. Noodles, char siew, and roast pork were all very good.

I didn't like the sausage as much, too sweet for my tastes. Noodles could have used a bit more sauce to make the dish less dry

Overall a good meal. Much better than your average ÁÉßËÖä stall.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106019061405768375668/reviews
Keify Toh,4,"The duck meat is very good. I order the 4.50 duck rice with $3 Wanton Soup.  The soup has this herbal taste which I like it alot.

If they have the sambal chilli, I would have given them the full 5 üåü.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107787013562023002862/reviews
Yong Yi,3,"For $2.50 during non-peak hours of 0830-1100, this is alright. A bit stingy w the portion of char siew and wantons but guess if you add meat, it‚Äôll prolly still be ranging the norm $3-4 prices.
Quality‚Äôs fine, belly char siew being used so it‚Äôs the right amount of fat, filling for wanton is meh and noodles are cooked alright, will return if in the area at the right time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115956441745196423077/reviews
