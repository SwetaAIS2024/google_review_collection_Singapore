Also, only few pieces of pork & 1 pathetic piece of enoki & veg.\n\nAsk boss can add soup or not, told me now herbs very expensive, cannot add soup & only 1 fill that's all. Total crap! Avoid this BKT at all costs, u can find better ones elsewhere than here!",

Claypot rice was mushy, unlike the regular ones that’s supposed to be dry. Server forgot about our pig trotters and even tho she prepared it in the spot, it wasn’t boiling. If you like herbal soup with strong herbal taste, this is the spot for you to go if you do not mind just warm soup. 10/10 would not visit again. Especially since server really could not be bothered.",

Back to business, served only 2 slim pork ribs, 1 slight vege & 1cm bunch of enoki mushroom. Portion for kids. Taste normal with soya light sauce. No offence just sharing for food hunters",
