Forest BK,4,"🏒A spacious ground delicated to the game of Woodball.
🏑The Sun Plaza Park Woodball Course is well shaded and has a Pavilion within the fairways.
But, the entire course seems a little neglected.
🏌️The game is usually played by seniors. But, some not so senior and younger ones were at play too.
🌿🏒The only other Woodball Lawn in Singapore is at Clementi Woods Park.
🍄Fun note:
Woodball was invented in 1990 by Weng Ming Hui in Taiwan as a recreational game for his father to enjoy as an alternative to golf.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
