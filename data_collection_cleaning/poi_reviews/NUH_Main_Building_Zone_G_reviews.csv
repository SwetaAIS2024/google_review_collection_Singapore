Athirah Ramli,5,"My mum was recently discharged from Ward 43, and I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the nurses that took care of my mum. Special thanks to Nurse Xin Ru (sorry if I got the spelling wrong) and nurse Sangeetha for their exceptional care and kindness. They were detailed, understanding, cheerful, and incredibly patient throughout. Their dedication truly made a difference, and I deeply appreciate their efforts in ensuring my mum‚Äôs comfort and well-being. Thank you for going above and beyond.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107098023216889992638/reviews

Ethel Lewis,1,Stupid system for visitation. ICU and have sit there till 12pm??? 2 person at a time.  So missed off at the stupidity of the people here. No flexibility at all. Why are they even working at the counter when the visiting hours starts at 12?!?!?! Sitting behind counter and bloody shake their legs. They assumed we have all day here waiting to visit our loved ones at their freaking stupid system.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112062690523501728865/reviews
Eddy Ram,5,"To Ward 41 Bed 20
Please send my gratitude to the fab service from  nurses Don Hua(from China), Patricia, a young malay lady in glasses( sorry did not get your name) and the rest of the nurses, Dr.Lee and those in the group of doctors taking turns in dealing with my mother last Monday to Saturday( 5 days).  Nurses were fabulous and caring, plus my mother who always never want to trouble nurses due to her nature of humility and respecting others. One constructive comment though that need improvement though. The different doctors that came to see my mother have different versions of the treatment rendered to my mother which I had brought to the attention to Dr.Lee . Though the ultimate objective is the same but it is essential to know what is the exact treatment was administered is essential for medical history records. Hence touchwood, when further treatment maybe needed doctors will know what was done previously. Just like the doctor has asked to bring my mother previous  records from other hospital. This is not the first time I have encounteted this. Doctors must clearly communicate what was done and other doctors who takes over the shift has the same understanding in communicating.
Please send my gratitude to the nurses, especially to those mentioned and Doctor Lee and the rest of Doctors in charge of Ward 41 Bed 20.
Thank you",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115337872424234672400/reviews
Elsa Ng,1,"Terrible experience when I was there 24-Sep-2023 around 4pm. I only wanted to pay for an orange juice $2.20, told the cashier paying by PAYWAVE but he heard PAYLAH, then he kept shaking his head with lousy attitude, insisted I said PAYLAH.

For his service I wanted to give zero star for this review, but one star so that i could click the ""post"" button",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114392883283772102865/reviews
