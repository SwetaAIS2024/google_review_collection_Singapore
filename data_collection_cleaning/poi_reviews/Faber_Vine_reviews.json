(thank you for being so generous, Julia)\n\nthe acrylic art pouring activity was also really therapeutic. we didnâ€™t just paint, Julia asked us meaningful questions to help us connect with our emotions during the process. was an interesting experience :D\n\nadded a cheese & meat platter which was absolutely tasty ðŸ¤© never thought that creating art would go well with snacks but now iâ€™m never doing any other way ðŸ˜‚\n\nthank you so much for the wonderful experience Julia! your graciousness and kindness shines forth in even the smallest attention to detail ðŸ¥°",
