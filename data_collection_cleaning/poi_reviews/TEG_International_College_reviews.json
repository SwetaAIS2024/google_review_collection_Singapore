      "text": "I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation and provide feedback on the recent holistic program organized by your school. Having participated in the activities, I am truly impressed by the thoughtful planning and the positive impact it had on everyone involved.\n\nThe program provided a wonderful opportunity for students to engage with the community, particularly with the elderly, in a meaningful and respectful manner. It was evident from the interactions and the atmosphere that the students were well-prepared, courteous, and genuinely enthusiastic about serving others. The activities were well-organized, and the students demonstrated strong teamwork and communication skills throughout the event.\n\nWhat stood out most was the inclusive environment created by the program. Participants from different backgrounds came together, fostering a sense of unity and mutual respect. The students' willingness to assist, listen, and interact with the elderly was heartwarming and reflects well on the values instilled by TEG International School.\n\nAdditionally, the staff and volunteers managed the event smoothly, ensuring that everyone felt welcomed and comfortable. The attention to detail, from setting up the venue to guiding participants, contributed to a positive and enjoyable experience for all.\n\nOverall, I believe this holistic program not only benefited the community but also provided valuable life lessons for the students. It helped nurture empathy, responsibility, and social awareness, which are essential qualities for future leaders.\n\nThank you once again for your dedication and for providing such a meaningful program. I look forward to seeing more initiatives like this in the future.\n\nWarm regards,",

It was so good to meet them. I learned to appreciate the value of listening. I learned the value of money and family bond, too. I had great interaction with elderly people. They shared their beautiful life stories that touched me. It would be great to have a short training session on how to interact with elderly residents. Lastly, I would love to volunteer again and spend time with them.",
