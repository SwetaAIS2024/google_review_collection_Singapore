espresso espresso,5,"It is located very convenient place just next to Novena MRT Exit. I visited place several times and felt the quality of service is good. All therapists are professional and I am satisfied with every visit.  Despite busy location, the place is very quiet and I can enjoy my quiet time here.   They have 2 branches near by and this B1 place is not too busy, so another convenience for me is easy to book, as I am always running tight schedule.  I think price can be better, it is not the place like China town cheap massage places, but offer hood balance between quality and price. I am sure I will go back again.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105970781499634213700/reviews
Jaclyn Low,5,My hubby and I make it a point to visit once a month. We have our preferred therapists but we experienced different ones too during our visits. All of them are professional and very good at what they do! The foot reflexology is quite thorough and level of strength can be requested. We normally do a one hour reflexology followed by 30 or 40 minutes shoulder and back massage. The shoulder and back massage is very good to relieve tension and knots. This is our monthly treat and we always feel good after a session there. Do make reservations and check out their combos before deciding on which is preferred. It’s a little pricey but it’s worth it!,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105880595103136544185/reviews
Tzetzefly,5,"Been here several times in the past few weeks for a lunchtime reflexology session. Wendy does a consistently good job and always leaves me feeling soothed and relaxed. The masseuses are in general non-chatty, which is good if you like enjoying your massage in quiet. Medical staff working in the area qualify for special prices - just ask at the counter.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115067614043809014898/reviews
Suan Yeo,5,"Very clean and professional setup. Foot reflexology was comfortable and relaxing, though a little on the pricey side compared to others in the area. But well worth it. Service was friendly and attentive. Might need to book ahead if coming on Friday night or weekend. Packages available.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102947155740486290254/reviews
