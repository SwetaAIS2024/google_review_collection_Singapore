The broth is deep, rich, and full of umami, the prawns are succulent, and every spoonful feels like a warm hug on a rainy day. Truly a standout among all the prawn noodles I’ve tried!",

Noodles and soup are nice with lots of vegetables, BUT the jumbo prawns were hard and over cooked. Disappointed coz I drove all the way from the west after the 2025 general elections to dine at jalan Kayu.",

Broth is not as thick as the beach road branch. But it’s still worth eating if Jalan kayu is nearer to your house. Price is higher compared to beach road.",

I am more for the Loyang Way Prawn Mee type. Nonetheless, it is still a good eat, just not good enough to attract me to visit specifically just for this like Loyang Way one did.
