      "text": "As a resident of the area, I've been passing by this convenience store for years. It's famous for playing suggestive jazz music, frankly it's a bit strange but okay.\n\nMy only gripe about the place is that it requires a minimum of $3 for digital payments. Last time, it was a minimum purchase of $3 to use NETS. I understand that it's a small business, and commissions eat up a lot of the profit margins.\n\nHowever, why is a minimum purchase of $3 needed for paylah/paynow purchases? The banks take ZERO commissions for these payment methods. I was forced to buy a $2 bag of  potato chips because my initial purchase of $2.50 wasn't enough.\n\nSo many small business shops accept Paylah/Paynow direct payment because there is zero commission. Seriously, get on with the times lah. Stop trying to be so greedy.",
