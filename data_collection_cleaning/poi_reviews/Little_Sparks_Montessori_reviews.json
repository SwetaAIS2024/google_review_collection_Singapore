      "text": "Little sparks is like a second home to my little one. Every member of this big family (Ms Gloria, Ms Nanda and all the teachers across the different grades) serve the cause with so much love and dedication. We had tried out many pre-schools before Little sparks and I must say this school is by far the best. It truly cares for the development of each child and invests tremendous patience and yet instill good discipline in the children. My daughter often comes back home and surprise me with things she learnt each day. Not just academics, but the values and other aspects of development. I can’t be more grateful for the 3 good years and will continue to work with Little sparks for after school care.\nI hope parents who are in search of a good school, please do not hesitate to send your kids here. I m sure you will be equally impressed.",

      "text": "As a parent of three children who have blossomed under the nurturing environment at Little Sparks Montessori, I am excited to share our family's incredible journey with this exceptional preschool. From the outset, Little Sparks Montessori stood out as a place where childhood curiosity is not just encouraged but celebrated. Each of my children, with their unique personalities and learning styles, were embraced and guided with care and expertise.\n\nThe approach at Little Sparks is distinctive – it’s a blend of structured learning and creative exploration that constantly engaged my children, unlocking their potential in ways I had not imagined possible. What truly amazed me was how the teachers at Little Sparks managed to tailor their approach to each child, ensuring that learning was both fun and deeply impactful. This personalized attention fostered a sense of independence and confidence in my children, qualities that have been pivotal as they transitioned to primary school.\n\nThe impact of Little Sparks Montessori extends beyond academic learning. My children developed into inquisitive learners; their ideas and contributions are often described as 'refreshing and funny' by their current school teachers. This ability to think outside the box and approach problems creatively is a direct result of the foundation laid at Little Sparks.\n\nEven now, my children fondly reminisce about their time at the preschool. They speak of their experiences and the fun they had with such joy and nostalgia. It's this enduring positive impression that really underscores the success of Little Sparks Montessori.\n\nI am sharing our story in the hope that it will inspire other families to consider Little Sparks Montessori for their children. It is a place where young minds are ignited, a nurturing ground for the next generation of creative, confident, and inquisitive learners. My heartfelt gratitude goes to the wonderful team at Little Sparks Montessori for playing such a significant role in my children's early years.",

      "text": "Happy Kids Happy Parents\n\nLittle Sparks Montessori has shown, and continues to, its exceptional quality and management of a pre-school.\n\nPrior, our daughter was enrolled at another establishment which was an absolute mess; high teacher turn-over rate and/or grumpy teachers.  This negative energy could be felt, not just visible in the children's demeanour.  As a parent I felt that our daughter was just another number to add to their count.  I pulled her out within the first month.\n\nBless Little Sparks Montessori! While it was tough for our daughter the first week or so at Little Sparks Montessori (new environment + negative experience at the last pre-school) she settled in quickly.  With the other school, the sight of the uniform made her cry.  With Little Sparks Montessori, although she preferred to play at home we saw that it did not affect her in any negative way when we got her into the Little Sparks Montessori uniform.  That said a lot!\n\nLittle Sparks Montessori is one of those fantasy lands where a child looks forward to be at; I don't know how they do it! Our daughter looked forward to the daily Little Sparks Montessori schedule! When she didn't it was because it was right after an extended break/vacation.\n\nIf there is anything one should worry about Little Sparks Montessori its that there is no way (I think) this experience will be carried over to grade/primary school; we can only hope.\n\nOur daughter has made wonderful friends (so have the parents) and we continue to stay in contact even though she has moved on to primary school.\n\nWe now send our daughter to Little Sparks Montessori's ASC (After School Care).  Here, she meets her old Little Sparks Montessori mates and she absolutely loves it!\n\nOn another note, I have 2 nephews, now 18 and 15, who attended Little Sparks Montessori and they are still in touch with Gloria and the staff at Little Sparks Montessori; so are other children and parents.  If this doesn't say something about Little Sparks Montessori's positive vibe I don't know what will.\n\nGloria is a breath of fresh air.  We're so lucky to have Gloria and her staff.  This is a place where the children are happy...isn't that all we need?",

      "text": "Little Sparks Montessori is a great childcare centre and I never once had any issue with the school. The amazing Principal and teachers at Little Sparks was instrumental in helping me raise my then 16th month old toddler while I was at work.  Not only did they adequately prepare my baby for Pri 1, they also nurtured her to be a curious, independent young lady.  My daughter still fondly remembers her interesting lessons such as drama, cooking, science and geography. As junior turns 16 years old this year, we continue to be thankful to all the wonderful educators at the school. They were and will always be an important extended family to us!",

      "text": "I’ve 3 kids who are going through or have gone through Little Sparks.\nMy primary school going kid had no problems adjusting to P1 as Little Sparks prepared him well for it. In fact he found the primary school curriculum a breeze cos he already had exposure to the syllabus in K2. In K2 they also teach them how to count money which was hugely useful in primary school when going to the canteen for the first time. My friends also commented at how quickly my kids pick up reading, which I attribute to the solid Montessori word blends which is taught at Little Sparks.\n\nLittle Sparks is big on warmth and hospitality. The teachers there know every child’s name although they may not be their direct students. When the kids first start school in PG, we would get pictures of how the kids are coping and get updated regularly by Gloria, this definitely helps with mummy jitters and apprehension.\n\nWould highly recommend it for anyone looking for a loving and warm school environment with a strong Montessori focus!",
