Kenny Yong,1,"Rude seller. Fruits can be potentially cheaper than supermarkets like fairprice but it's not worth the effort.

Bought mandarin oranges today and the experience wasn't good when I was told off by the staff for removing stems of the oranges. No signage to say you can't remove the stems and mind you these oranges come with like long stems and  leaves which wld probably make a hole in the carrier bag. I don't understand why the staff can be bothered to prep the fruits before Sale and they expect the customer to be for orange stem and leaves together with the oranges.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114730350188071711285/reviews

Anonymous User,1,"Stop buying from this stall. It's 2024, start telling your families and friends to check Google reviews before patronizing any store. They have multiple horrible reviews and it shows that this shop is a TOTAL SCAM. Their durians are actually rotten and I'm not kidding when I say I saw maggots in the durian LOL speechless to say",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106866550286311509268/reviews
