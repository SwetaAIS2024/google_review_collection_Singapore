Biz Teow,5,"The execution of their services, from getting the undertakers involved and creating a photo for the deceased, to the wake arrangements and cremation, have been smooth and efficient. This company provides highly reliable and professional services which have been used by my bigger family for 2 generations. With their 2nd generation taking over the running of the business, the company's services have become even better and more suited to the ways of life, work, and communication styles of new customers.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104717315405613671222/reviews
Joy Lim,5,"This is the 3rd time my family engaged AYS across more than 10 years and we can see vast improvements in their services.  In the past, it was already very organized, and even more so now.  This is a company that continuously improves and make things better.

From pre-planning to the completion of my father's passing and ash scattering, Ms Ang and her team stayed with us throughout the whole process, providing prompt assistance to our questions, making it so much easier to focus on what we need to do for our father.

The entire team is very professional, and our guests were also very impressed with the very nice setup of the whole wake, we even have some guests requesting for their name cards!

Thank you very much Ms Ang and your team again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108694888978369676816/reviews
