Rachel Cheong,5,My daughter tells me that Mr Siew's Math classes are fun and engaging. She attended lessons only in her P6 year and the consistent revision and guidance helped her achieve AL1 for her PSLE. Mr Siew's explanations are clear and he manages to simplify problem sums in a way that students can understand and replicate.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117959077337309842147/reviews
Tan Alicia,5,"I have been attending math tuition at  Maths
Accelerator Center. Mr Siew‚Äôs lessons  which are indeed incredibly engaging and enjoyable. He revealed the joy and fun in critical thinking through solving word  problems. When I was struggling through maths in Primary 4, he patiently guided me through all the questions. His lessons really gave me a passion for maths, it let me see maths in a whole new perspective. I am truly grateful towards him, he put in so much effort and put in so much time to collect (credited) and rewrite word problems for us to practice. His efforts are greatly appreciated. He definitely helped me  through my Primary School journey to achieve an AL1 for Mathematics (PSLE 2024). Thank you, Mr Siew.

Meaghan Soon,5,"Thank you to Mr Siew for your utmost care and meticulous guidance with Oliver in his Maths learning journey. Since starting with MAC, Oliver has said that he had learnt various strategies and techniques to conquer his questions with confidence. His recent WA (98%) and recent Mock Paper (90%) was a testament to his learning at MAC where he was able to apply those strategies learnt from Mr Siew. These scores made him the highest achiever in class with Maths.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101715174336822026471/reviews
Mohankumar Jeevanandam,1,"Our own experiences recenlty.
- Not so great as expected.
- Anything can be taught, when attitude is wrong. Nothing can be improved.
- Mr. Chief Trainer took classes for P6. My Kids felt his approach and action towards kid was not good, not so encouraging. Kids were asking multiple times on a specific problem. Seems he responded rudely and not encouraged to reach him again.
- Also, reaching me out for silly things seems to be so childish. Should have been managed well between kids & teachers.
- He may be good only for fewer faster students. If so, then no point. Teacher is to bring up the one from the scratch or those who gets lesser mark/failing to the mid-range to topper.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100227961097877683820/reviews
