Zahari Nawi,5,"This is the oldest mosque and place of worship in Singapore.

It was established in 1820 in an area known as Kampong Melaka as many traders and fishermen from Malacca had settled here soon after Singapore became a British Port.

The mosque was built by and named after Syed Omar Bin Ali Aljunied, an Arab merchant from Hadhramaut and a landowner whose family contributed greatly to Singapore’s early development by building mosques, bequeathed a plot of land in Victoria Street for Muslim burials including building of community wells and bridges.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101847246619607795969/reviews

Muhammad Nurhaikal,4,"Alhamdulillah for this mosque. Mainly cater to those working nearby. Parking is a tough one though. The surrounding buildings' carparks  are only accessible for season parking holders. There seems to be a handful of parking lots in the mosque compound but when I was there, the gate was closed. They allowed me to park right outside the gate though, since it was at night.

The mosque, while on the smaller side,  is clean and well mantained. There's a couple of vending machines near the entrance. Plenty of wudhu area. The main prayer hall is quite large and the floor is padded.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117247274329004802920/reviews
