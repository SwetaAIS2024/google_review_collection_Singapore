      "text": "Finally made the step to go back to Sunday mass after Covid. Not going to lie... couldn't be bothered to go when one needs to register, keep a safe distance or wear a mask, which are all thankfully, dispensed with.\nPriest was Chinese and the homily was way too long in my opinion at 20 mins. Spoke about many things and include repeating the Gospel. Then after that, wanted to spend another 5 mins to talk about Pope Francis passing and made an 'effort' to ask the congregation's permission to do so. Really?!\nPope Francis said that homily should be 8 mins and at most 10 mins. Keep it short and sweet and to the point. Don't need to make 5-8 points which in the end, I left with nothing much that registered.",

      "text": "Located at 30 Sallim Road, The Church of St Stephen began as a humble wooden chapel on land owned by the Canossian Sisters.In the early days, Masses were celebrated in the chapel and later in the school hall of Canossa Convent. Later, an outhouse on stilts, which originally served as a boys’ dormitory, was converted for Sunday worship.\n\nFrom the rickety wooden church, the community grew. The early congregation made do with borrowed chairs, leaky roofs and noisy floorboards, spilling out of the building during Mass.\n\nIt may have started off as a humble wooden shed, but its purpose was always a holy and noble one. Today, the Church of St Stephen continues to be the spiritual pillar for Catholics in the MacPherson – Aljunied area",

The aircon is cool and comfortable and it is not crowded even on the weekend evening mass.\nAfter attending the church service, you can walk across the bridge of a large canal to the Circuit Road hawker centre for meals.",
