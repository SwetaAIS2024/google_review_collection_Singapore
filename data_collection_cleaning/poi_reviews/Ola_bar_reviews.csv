Agar -sgp,5,"We had a fantastic experience at Ola bar on Siloso Beach on a public holiday Sunday for our Mother’s Day celebration. Thanks to our reservation, getting in was smooth and hassle-free, even with the crowd.

A special shout-out to Ann for her extra sweet and super-fast service — she truly made our day! From the moment we arrived, her attentiveness stood out, including the lovely gesture of bringing water for our dog. It was thoughtful and heartwarming.

The food was amazing, the sunset music added a magical touch, and the family-friendly vibe with kids enjoying the pool and beach made the atmosphere feel so lively and joyful. We loved the music, the setting, and most of all, the service. Ann’s hospitality was the feather in the cap of a perfect day.

Highly recommended — we’ll definitely be back!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109346719254817187714/reviews
Stephen MacLean,5,"Great beach bar, we went in the week so there was no minimum spend on beds , we took 3 sunbeds with umbrellas. All they ask is you buy a few drinks which is understandable, we had a few drinks and lunch was great. Just before we were w leaving there was a storm and they gave us a lift back to the bus station in a golf buggy so we didn’t get wet (Amazing Service) loved our day.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103763020565226861811/reviews
RMP TV,3,"Food ok only, view ok. Service staff ok also. Didn’t meet any rude staff that day, but not sure about other timing. We went at 7:55, last order at 8pm.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115460430171539057543/reviews
Ellery O'Connell,3,"Pretty views, but slow service. Took us a long time to get drinks and food. We had to ask multiple times to get our orders. This beach and bar is a pretty place to hang out, but if there were another option open on Sunday night, we would have taken it. Anyway, the beach was nice and a nice place to hang out.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100210355858434448500/reviews
Chris Pettigrove,1,Heaps of tables available. We sit down at one to be told we have to make a booking and it's a minimum spend of $50 . We go to make a booking but they put on deck chairs. Can we have a table I asked?  Oh I'm not sure I'll have to ask said the host. After waiting for 5 minutes and looking at 40 empty tables.. We left..   Place looks good tho. Walked to another bar.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117486742891465938771/reviews
