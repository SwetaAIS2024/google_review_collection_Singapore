C,2,"The Event Lawn at HortPark in Alexandra is a spacious, open grassy area, presumably meant for events or gatherings, though I’ve never attended any here. Visited casually, and there wasn’t much to see or do—just a large patch of grass with no seats available. Although highly suited for recreational activities, I haven’t noticed people using it for that purpose. Kind of a waste.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
