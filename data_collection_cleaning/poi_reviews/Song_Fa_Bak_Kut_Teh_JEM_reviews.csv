Liau Yuan Wei,4,Back to Song Fa again but this time at Jem outlet. Their bak kut teh is the pepper kind. Taste wise nice but the portions seem small for the price we are paying.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101467908285337699109/reviews
AC Chan,5,"Rainy day just got a whole lot better with every sip of this popular Teochew version of garlicky, rather strong-flavoured and intensely peppery broth. The loin ribs? üçñ Robust and meaty that are not exactly fall-off-the-bone but perfectly cooked to the desired tenderness!
And let‚Äôs not forget the thoughtful touch of having our soup refilled from a kettle throughout the meal. ‚ù§Ô∏è",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
C long,4,"Recently visited SongFa Jem outlet, the staff was very accommodating and friendly.

We have a little one with us and they offered to help with the baby chair, and even wipe them clean before passing it over to us. Really appreciate the serve as other restaurant usually can't be bothered wiping down the chairs. 100/10 on that part.

Food wise, felt that the other outlet that we ate at tasted much better. The meat this time was a little tough but overall we had a good and decent meal. Worth the try!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112059461243706324823/reviews
Merryheart,4,"Song Fa is a household name when it comes to Singapore-style Bak Kut Teh, and their JEM outlet delivers exactly what you'd expect-a piping hot, peppery, and meaty broth that warms you from the inside out. Unlike its more herbal counterparts, this version is bold and robust, pairing perfectly with crispy you tiao for that satisfying contrast in texture.
What truly stands out, though, is the service.
The staff are impressively attentive, always ready to top up your soup without you even asking, all while remaining polite and friendly. It's a small touch, but it makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable.
For a comforting, no-fuss Bak Kut Teh meal with excellent service, Song Fa at JEM is definitely worth a visit.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101391398296811227556/reviews
Faye Yap (Âè∂Ê†©ÁªØ),5,"The food never disappoints! It‚Äôs always yummy no matter which outlet you go.

It usually gets really crowded, but the good thing is you can place your order while queuing so you don‚Äôt have to wait too long for your food to arrive.

Also, I love the service here as they‚Äôre very proactive with adding your soup, unlike the Chinatown outlet where you have to ask them and they take forever to serve you.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101750484940912874032/reviews
