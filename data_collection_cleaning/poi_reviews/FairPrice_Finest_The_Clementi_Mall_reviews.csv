Astraeus Tu,5,"So happy to have a fairpricr finest at clementi mall. It has all the groceries and food stuff needed for daily life. The variety of meat and veggies are very great, also got a lot of fruits. Only thing i am unhappy about is they dont provide the cheap smart choice bread jumbo pack, and the cheapeast fairpricr white bread is always short of supply. Expect a long queue at peak hours (5-7pm), but there are quite a few auto checkout machines do the waiting time is acceptable",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112508317414544824402/reviews
Shyamala Mogan,3,"Bought a packet of US blueberries, it was expensive at $15+ and I was wondering why wasn't the packet sealed. I went quite early this morning and the salesperson was packing the fruits and she also accidentally dropped the fruits on the floor. Aren't the fruits delivered packaged and sealed? It was from Sweet Selections, direct from the US. If it's not sealed, some shoppers can easily remove them and I've seen it for others.
I only noticed it upon reaching home.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117056252650763023522/reviews
Artem Moshnin,5,"Well organised and spacious grocery store, with good quality products for reasonable price. It spans over two levels of different types of products with big headings to navigate around easily. Nice atmosphere to spend time walking around and shopping. The staff there were kind and friendly, very helpful in finding what we needed. I got some groceries and also tried out their sushi selection. It was pretty fresh and very convenient to eat from - a mix of salmon sashimi, salmon sushi, and cold soba noodles with dipping sauce.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114186673531048387843/reviews
