CCS,3,"Absolutely delicious mee goreng, bee hoon goreng puteh, and mutton soup - anywhere.

Superfast, too. The man is amazing. Non-stop stir frying. Plenty of wok hee and generous with ingredients.

I've been patronizing them for four years, always satisfying, always delicious. Prices are most reasonable.

You can't miss the stall. Just follow your ears to the loudest clanging of wok. Yes, very loud.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
Marcus Goh,3,"Food center see better times, been renovated before. Stall is clean with good variety of Indian Muslim food. Food price is inexpensive,  mee goreng look and tasted good. Friendly chap manning stall in afternoon. Was there in afternoon, and drawn by the sound of noodle being fried in wok. Will visit next time to try other food.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105182234976754893762/reviews
hb liu,5,my favourite prata place.  it is hard to find a prata place that has good sambar (vegetarian curry).  most places either don't serve sambar or serve sambar that is too watery/dilute or too salty.  p. baharnisha serves the perfect sambar - delicious with tons of ingredients and it packs a just-right spicy punch.  goes perfectly with a nice glass of teh halia.  the sambar is often sold out by 9 (or earlier) but the mutton and fish curries are just as good.  their mutton soup for lunch is really nice also.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101122529962019501983/reviews
