Abigail Tan,1,Had such a poor experience here. Service was super slow and it seemed they were prioritising their own staff eating at the restaurant over the customers. The Thai food (not lok lok) tasted like it had a lot of msg in it and was overpriced for the quality. There was some nice live music but it was played way too loudly to be enjoyable. Will never come back.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114527883741549935916/reviews
