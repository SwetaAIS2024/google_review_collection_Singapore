The dishes, especially the spicy cold chicken, noodles, and soup, were flavorful and carried the authentic Sichuan taste. The balance of spices and the texture of the noodles were impressive.\n\nThe ambiance is casual and comfortable, perfect for a no-fuss meal. Itâ€™s great for anyone looking for a satisfying meal with a kick of spice. Iâ€™d definitely consider returning when Iâ€™m in the area. A solid option for Sichuan cuisine lovers!",
