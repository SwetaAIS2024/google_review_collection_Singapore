Choon Kit Leong,4,"Had a dinner meeting at this place.

Nice ambience, quiet and well behaved crowd.

The pasta we ordered was decent. Worth a visit.

Love to eat in front of shelves of lovely wines. üòãüòò

The waiters and waitress were professional and friendly, yet not intrusive.

Overall a very pleasant dining experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105403566482999279179/reviews
JATHL,4,"Wine Connection outlets never seem to disappoint. The best thing about them has got to be the great selection of wines by the glass.
The food menu is usually quite extensive too.
On this occasion, I had the fried baby crabs which were served with a tzatziki-like sauce. A simple dish but quite a treat. The rose pasta was a bit claggy but decent enough to be enjoyed. Finally, their apple crumble had a good balance of tartness and sweetness which made it a light and easy finish to the meal.
Will be back! Mostly for the wine üòÇ",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110357299060106350854/reviews
Bear Gwee,3,"All opinions are based on personal experience on visits.

Thought empty, but staffs aren't attentive.

I waited 15 minutes for the French onion soup, but it was absolutely worth it‚Äîit tasted amazing!
The broth was perfectly simmered, rich, and flavorful. Nothing beats to this cozy bowl of comfort.

On the other hand, the BBQ Pork Ribs is disappointing for a main.
It's warm, not hot, I guess microwave does the work.
It wasn't tender as expected and dry.
I didn't finish & left.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106416093097034029039/reviews
S Law,4,"We like their selection of dishes, many choices listed in their well curated menu. Great choices of wine, Prosecco and champagne at decent prices. We had Lamb shank,  which was moist and tender, and served with mash potatoes. Prawn Gambas unfortunately was too oily, not quite what we expected this time. Big shout out to their service team who extended excellent service throughout our meal. Will be back again for sure.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117634223302075240385/reviews
Min HL,4,"Highly recommend getting the pizza -
Tartufo e Funghi ! love the mushrooms and truffle üçïü§§üòã

The lamb rack had too much fats attached to the ribs which we did not eat

Service was prompt and food was served pretty fast.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103965869018673563240/reviews
