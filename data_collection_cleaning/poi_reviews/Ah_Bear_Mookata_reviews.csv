Carol Ang,5,Must try ! The meat was all seasoned to perfection and generously. Fish head curry is awesome and cannot be missed. Staff is friendly and even check if everything is ok? Boss is very friendly too. We had a good time eating with friends. Book before coming and boss will arrange a nice place at the coffee shop for you.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100632375825981658629/reviews

Nivaa,5,"The chilli sauces was good. Good amount of meat given!! PRICE IS SO WORTHY! 7 OF US AND ONLY WAS $123.60. The tomyum broth was the best! Spicy and good. In all, it's a best place to go. Trust me! Their hospitality was so good!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•ü§ôüèΩ",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104146474436663150011/reviews
Ewart Yong,5,I have been here several times already for both the Mookata and zi char.  The food has been consistently excellent and very reasonably priced. Service is excellent as well with all dishes (I‚Äôll typically order 4-5 dishes) usually being served within 10-15 minutes upon ordering. I highly recommend the fish head curry and pork ribs.  It is a nice informal gathering place and I have had two mini class reunions here within these couple of months.  Owner Sebes is really friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this place.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101040383744183898905/reviews
Chloe,3,"service - 5 stars, they constantly came to check up on us. there was also a station to make your own dipping sauce

food- 3/5 it was not bad, we ordered the tom yum soup but it wasn‚Äôt really worth it, was a little weird. the price for 3 pax was quite affordable, $50 total. the seasoning was ok. garlic chicken was good! but the marinated beef was too sweet. around $3 per portion of meat. minimum 10 portions for ala carte

overall so-so (to reiterate, in my personal opinion)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101317387178243159526/reviews
