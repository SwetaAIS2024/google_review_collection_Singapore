Didn’t manage to catch the server’s name but the server was a British man who made our dining experience so much more enjoyable ◡̈\nHis cheerful and entertaining disposition was very welcoming. 100/10 would visit again ^^\n\nWe ordered the “Infamous” Australian Wagyu hanging tender, 2 Black Angus Ribeyes, Mentaiko Madness Pasta, Red Wine Beef Ragu Pasta, Mentaiko Mayhem Fries, Dan’s Legendary Mac & Cheese, and Creamy Creamed Spinach.",

It's a good vibe stakehouse with a decent price.",

The tater tots and mushroom trio were good and price friendly.\n\nWe had the sharing cut for the medium rare beef tenderloin, which I find apart from the crust which was well seasoned, the rest of it was abit bloody or lack balanced flavour and searing.\n\nThe beef ragu was a nice touch for a carb with tender beef meat. However I don’t think it was necessary option, could probably try more dishes.",

The taste of the grilled was just nice not overdone and top layer of the beef is crispy.\n\nThe Aglio olio spaghetti however was a lil salty and dry. Bacon bits are overdone so is too hard.\n\nTruffle Fries are crispy and has good amount of truffle oil.\n\nAtmosphere is great and classy. Overall still a great steakhouse, If you are here for steaks.",
