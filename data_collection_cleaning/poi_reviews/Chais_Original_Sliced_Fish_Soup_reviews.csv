Momo Bluemilk,5,"My favourite fish soup.

The staff is friendly and good in packing the food so the soup does not spill out.

Good and big portion. The soup taste very good.

Located in kopitiam. Can use fairprice apps to pay and get discount.

I can say this fish soup store is the best.

Definitely value the money.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115162653890526555599/reviews

Nilesh Rai,1,Please don't ever order from this stall unless you like to find hidden unwanted surprises like insects in your food. I don't usually give such bad reviews but this was really a huge disappointment and disgusting experience for me.
