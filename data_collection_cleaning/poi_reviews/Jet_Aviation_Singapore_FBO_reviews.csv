carlos quintana,1,"The worse FBO in Singapore, the crew got to the FBO and the front desk said that a handler will come get us soon, waited 15 minutes to ask how much longer for our tail number and the same handler that greeted us was surprised that we were the crew, apparently pilot uniforms didn‚Äôt give it away ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Now in the airplane sitting here on the ramp trying to get a hold of someone to come get a pilot to meet the passengers inside and neither us or security can reach anyone in the FBO.
