      "text": "Perfect Family Stay with Amazing Veg Breakfast Options!\n\nWe had a fantastic 7-night stay at Hotel V Lavender as a family of three, and everything exceeded our expectations. The hotel was clean, comfortable, and conveniently located, making it easy for us to explore the city.\n\nOne of the biggest highlights for us was the breakfast—there was an impressive variety of vegetarian options every morning, which made our stay even more enjoyable. From fresh fruits and pastries to warm, flavorful dishes, we felt well taken care of and looked forward to breakfast every day.\n\nThe staff was warm, friendly, and always ready to help with anything we needed. Housekeeping was prompt and thorough, and the overall atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming.\n\nHighly recommended for families looking for a convenient, comfortable, and veg-friendly stay in the city. We would definitely come back!",

It is connected to Lavender MRT and they have foodcourt full of food options.\n\nI stayed in the twin deluxe room. It was not spacious but ok to rest. Very small space left to be able to sholat. The bed is good. Linen good. Towel and bathroom good too. But no bidet at the closet.\n\nIt can be a good place to rest after exploring Singapore when on budget",

The room was decent and the cleaning was alright, but the hair dryer was honestly one of the worst I’ve used (bring your own if you can). That said, the overall experience was still really good, and I’d definitely recommend this hotel for its convenience and comfort!",

The frontdesk staff was also very helpful. The only cons was, the room i stayed had no bidet but everything else was great.",
