      "text": "2024 has been a horrible year for me which require multiple visits to the doctor. Special thanks to Dr Quah & Dr Ong for always being so meticulous with my symptoms and for giving helpful advices along the way.\n\nDr Quah was super efficient, patient and able to catch all the very minor symptoms. Didn‚Äôt even know I had influenza A till he offered to do a respi swab. Without him I would‚Äôve probably gotten all the normal flu medications and feel worse thereafter.\n\nDr Ong is super calm & comforting with her words, offering lots of advice & suggestions, even tried to help me expedite my Neuro appt at a govt hosp which I‚Äôm very thankful for.\n\nThe receptionists are also very efficient and friendly compared to other clinics.",

She answers all my questions too so I don't feel rushed at all.\n\nThank you so much!",

      "text": "After my bad visit at Viva Medical Clinic, i have decided to leave a review for them and for Crossroads Family Clinic.\n\nCrossroads clinic has been my favourite clinic since the start. From the receptionists to the doctors, all tip too, professional and great people.\n\nDr Quah has been my son‚Äôs doctor since he was born. Me & husband has always been in awe at how good and professional Dr Quah is. We have never met a doctor as calm and amazing as him. We always look for him when wanting to visit because we know he is the best of the best.\n\nHavent had the chance to meet Dr Ong, but i heard she is Dr Quah‚Äôs wife. Hehe. Heard from other patients, she is very good and very calm and amazing as well. Some even say if you‚Äôre scared to see doctor, see Dr Ong. Cause her tone of voice is very soothing and calming. Lol dont know if true or not hehe.\n\nThe malay lady working front counter, never got her name but she has been there from the start. She‚Äôs the best. Very friendly, homely like Dr Quah as well. Good at her job. Polite & Courteous & saw her teaching a new staff a couple of times. Very good üëçüèº\n\nThe chinese aunty working front counter, talk alot. Nag alot also. Sometimes dont understand what she saying. But very funny & friendly. Polite and kind as well.\n\nI love this clinic, seriously. Its the best! Dr Quah is very gentle with kids and elderlies too. My grandmom comes here for her bi-monthly appointments. My whole family loves Dr Quah. He‚Äôs truly the best. Thanks to him, my grandmom‚Äôs health had improved ALOT.\n\nGo here! Dont go Viva Medical. Lol",
