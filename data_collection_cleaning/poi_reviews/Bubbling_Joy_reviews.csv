Vivian Chew,5,Bubbling Joy dryclean rates is definitely cheaper than Preston in Bedok mall. Been going to Siew Kim few times to dry clean my trenchcoat after trip and its definitely value for money! Price is less than 20$ depending on material! Can choose to PayNow or Pay later when collect. Just remember to go and collect as there is no reminders.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109908337646647328065/reviews
