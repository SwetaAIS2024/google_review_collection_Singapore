The pasta is truffle based (30 cents extra), the taste is great, strong truffle taste, the pasta is well cooked as well. Salmon is small portion but the tenderness was just nice, won’t crumble into pieces and not too tough. Spent 30 cents to change to mushroom soup but felt like the soup can be better. Felt that the soup was slightly watery that day.",

      "text": "Halal Food. The food is good, and you can add $4 for a set that includes an additional soup and drink. The normal set costs $12.90. The staff mentioned that NTU has its own menu, which is different from other branches.\n\nFor the main course, I highly recommend the salmon (an additional $2). It is much meatier and more flavorful than at other places in NTU, but it tends to run out quickly. The sides (2 out of 3 from french fries, broccoli and corns) are served in large portions. For the soup, the mushroom soup is the safest option; tomato soup could be sour to some; pumpkin soup could be weird to some. The tea is freshly made on the day itself.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and patient, willing to answer any questions you have about choosing your meal or the free membership.\n\nRegarding membership, you can collect points but cannot use vouchers because the prices are lower than at other branches.",

      "text": "Being a grad student at NTU, I have at least 3-4 meals in a month here at The Soup spoon. Being a vegetarian I mostly stick to the meatless minestrone soup. I do miss the wraps option they use to have earlier. I do like their salad,pretty simple. Wish they could increase the serving quantity slightly though. This outlet is priced lesser than the outlets outside NTU. So make the most of it.\nI was also wondering if they can serve the drinks in non plastic containers when one is not taking away the drinks.",
