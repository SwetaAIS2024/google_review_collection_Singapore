Navin Kumaran,2,"The ambiance was quite noisy, with a loud band playing, making it not an ideal spot to relax.

As for the food, we tried the pasta with lamb chop and the fish & chips.
•	Fish & Chips: The fish and sauce were delicious, but the coleslaw fell short—too crunchy due to the shredded cabbage and lacking enough dressing.
•	Carbonara Pasta with Lamb Chop: The pasta sauce was overly watery, and the lamb chop was undercooked and chewy (as shown in the picture). Definitely not recommended.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100208331728353677389/reviews
Guanny G,4,"A decent place to chill and relax, family friendly at earlier hours as the place serves quite a good range of dishes from Asian and Western.

Many families with young children are there enjoying the food and drinks for adults. House music is pleasant with popular sing-along songs.

Tried their signature pork burger. Fries are made fresh (plus point). House happy hour beer was served ice cold (plus point).",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110289275840637213691/reviews
