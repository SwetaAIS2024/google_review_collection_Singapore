Charles Lau,5,"This nostalgic pool retains its 1980s/1990s look and it's just a 5 minutes walk from Queenstown MRT. The competition pool here is different from the pools in other swimming complex as there are 9 lanes and the two ends are 1.2m and 1.5m deep. (Most other pools have 8 lanes and both ends are 1.2m deep.) The water level is also a foot lower than the edge, necessitating the use of the ladder or very strong arms to get out.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117036636990747895222/reviews

Jan C,3,"The upkeep of the stadium could be improved on. The track is terribly unmaintained and the lane markings are faded.
Also if you're wondering where is the ""Old shoe new future"" bin to donate old or spoiled rubber shoes for recycling, it's hidden near the main entrance of the stadium.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113234961506743595015/reviews
