Paid him and I just went around the corner to POSB ATM to do my thing. Went back to pick it up and took a 10-15min walk home. It was a cool evening as it rained heavily earlier. Brought it back into an air conditioned room, went for shower and sat down to start on the popiah at 8.15pm. It was spoilt! The smell was obvious! Has he sold me leftovers?! Didn’t think it was worth going back as he would most likely deny responsibility. Would leave zero star if I could!",
