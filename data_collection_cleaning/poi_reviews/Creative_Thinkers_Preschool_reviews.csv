J T,5,"My partner and I have been so impressed with Ms Sakinah, Ms Aisha and their team at Creative Thinkers. Not only is my (R) child well cared for, R is also educated and has better manners from attending. R looks forward to going to daycare there and is always left in high spirits. R's clothes used to always come back stained at the daycare we attended overseas but at Creative Thinkers R is always kept clean. We love the CTP family!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117020262044997162240/reviews
