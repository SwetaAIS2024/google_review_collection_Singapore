      "text": "A few days ago, I visited 39+ Art Space with friends, and I must say, it’s probably one of the nicest small-to-medium-sized galleries I’ve ever been to! The artworks on display are meticulously curated, a testament to the excellent work of the curatorial team. I’m still debating whether to buy one of the horse drawings above the lobby desk—if only I wasn’t broke, haha!\n\nIt’s such a great place to visit and get lost in the art. A big shoutout to Ning at the lobby, who was incredibly kind and helpful for educating and facilitating us!",

However, the experience was dampened by staff, who was unwelcoming from the moment I arrived. Their unfriendly demeanor made it hard to fully enjoy the art. It's a shame that such beautiful works are overshadowed by poor customer service.",
