This was a super fun bike excursion that allowed us to see a different side of SG and connect with fellow cyclists.   Great drop off service and solid equipment, highly recommend.",

The bikes were well kept and practically new. We met Laurent at the MRT station, he gave us some tips on where to go on the island, and then he picked up the bikes from our hotel.  Super easy and great fun!",
