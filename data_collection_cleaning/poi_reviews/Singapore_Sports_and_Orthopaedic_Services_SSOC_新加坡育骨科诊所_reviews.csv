Elliot Gough,5,"I was referred to Dr. Tung in June 2023, and he has been my orthopaedic clinician and surgeon ever since. In December 2024, I underwent spinal decompression and discectomy under Dr. Tung’s guidance and execution, and the results have been miraculous. My sciatic pain has reduced by over 95%, and I now enjoy full freedom and mobility for the first time in 18 months. I am incredibly grateful to Dr. Tung for this transformation.

Throughout my entire tenure as his patient, Dr. Tung has always been consultative, accommodating, and supportive. Prior to the discectomy, he performed PRP treatment and nucleoplasty on the injured disc, aiming to exhaust the least invasive treatments before proceeding to surgery. He consistently communicated very clearly about the pros and cons of various options, taking into consideration my preferences, including supporting me with epidurals and oral steroids during severe pain episodes.

He even helped me manage my pain to run a half-marathon with my back condition. I am deeply thankful for Dr. Tung's understanding, genuine care, and interest in the well-being of his patients. He is not only an exceptional doctor but also a pleasant and warm-hearted person. I highly recommend Dr. Tung to anyone in need of orthopaedic care.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108226046585262426564/reviews

Jess 666,5,Very friendly receptions who are kind and polite. When I first called them they attended to my injury with care and asking questions to properly understand my situation.
