Jamaliah Shariff,5,The preschool is very close to the Punggol Mrt/Bus Interchange. Itâ€™s a kindergarten setting with classes in different bays. The main office is located very near the drop off porch. However if it rains there is no shelter from the block to the drop off porch unless you take the lift down to the basement level.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103140007490875740839/reviews
