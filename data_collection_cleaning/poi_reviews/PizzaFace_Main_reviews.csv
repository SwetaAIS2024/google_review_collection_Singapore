Moogaambikai Thangaveloo,5,Came here for a simple dinner. The pizza and the starter salad was really good. They have a huge variety of pizza and pasta. Would definitely come back here to try the rest. Laid back atmosphere. Perfect for a quiet evening with good company.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103533875278781865284/reviews
Kai,5,"The service is top-notch. We came in during a stormy Saturday evening without a reservation.  The tables were all booked except for the al fresco ones, which easily get wet.

The more senior lady staff, upon seeing us struggle to make a decision whether to eat outside or make a move, told us to come inside before doing some calculations and making a table available for us. Even though this meant that we could have eaten slowly and disrupted the reservation party, they did not mention it or push us to speed up.

The same kind lady, even had great initativeness and spotted a cooler bag we had and asked if it was a cake she'd like to help us put in the fridge. ðŸ¤—

We made our orders, and all came out fast and super tasty. Favourite was the calzone! Will be back! And do remember to make a reservation!

KT Koh,3,"Place is situated just at Concourse along Beach Rd. Not difficult to get to.
Went 2 weeks back for a Friday dinner when it was raining heavily. Small cozy little space with just a few seating capacity.

Got a starter, side and pizza to share for 2 person. Food portion was good. Just right for 2 persons to share. Mozzarella Salad was fresh and came with thick slices of mozzarellas and tomatoes, taste was okay. Truffle fries was fragrant and portion was really good. Pizza was nothing too spectacular, wish it could be better!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103154024908702525541/reviews
Darryl Tai,5,"We ordered:

1) Mushrooms black truffle pizza - the topping was very flavourful, bursting with every bite.
2) Carbonara - al dente was on point. Carbonara sauce was the perfect blend of yolk and cheese.
3) Beef stew - stewed in tomato sauce, meat was tender and moist.
4) Truffle fries - for crispy fries lover.
5) Affogato - large ice cream serving paired with aromatic italian coffee.
6) Draft Beer - $12 per print !!ðŸ¤¤

Will come back for more!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114746800207389363461/reviews
Yong Yi,4,"Not bad food, just not my favourite type of pizza dough but itâ€™s still a made well dough.
Carbonara was a surprise because the pasta was actually al dente.
Toppings on the pizza does feel skimped.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115956441745196423077/reviews
