Ben Y,5,"Food is fresh. The platter is both enough for 2 to 3 pax. And the prawns are both large and fresh.

Owners are friendly and service oriented. A la carte menu is inexpensive and value for money.

Lovely place to eat. And wonderful people serving you to top it off.

A must try for anyone!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108645476675071634409/reviews
kinomoto 1151,5,"I'm glad I gave this mookata stall a try despite many times of disappointment at other places! Very fresh ingredients with reasonable portion for the mini hotpot. The fire was able to last through my meal for close to 30 min. Would definitely come back to try the real mookata next time! Just a small feedback for the chilli sauce, its on the sweet side, would be good to balance with some acidity like lime or vinegar so more refreshing as a dip for the cooked ingredients.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100000990332413690886/reviews
Jodeci Fine,5,"Ulu hawker centre jalan batu is a happening place now!!

Another exciting new stall in this hawker, stall manned by friendly owners specialising in mini hotpot & mookata. With 3 broth and various meats/seafood to choose from. We got beef set for $9.80 each with chicken broth & tom yam broth. Each set comes with variety of fresh ingredients.

They should be very proud of their soup base cause it's heavenly good. We had high praise for the chicken broth. It's excellently brewed with strong herbal taste. Also, tom yum broth was good too, not too sour but spicy. Very 适合我们的口味.

We throw in all the ingredients except beef & egg. Let it cook for a few mins and absorb the tasty broth. Soak the beef for a few second and enjoy the softy beef. Taste like shabu shabu, so delicious! Lastly, pop the egg and have a yummy onsen egg.

And YES, 汤底的金华 make us finish the soup till the very last drop. What a great meal!! Definitely worth a trip!!

Karen Genevieve Ang,5,"If you prefer Quality over quantity, this is the place to go!

Generous serving and freshness of the food especially the prawns (most important for me)

Chill dip is oso nice and authentic, topping it with extra garlic to give your sauce an extra oomph.

Cutlery are very pretty.

Ample of seats available even on a Saturday evening. Parking is also very convenient.

Friendly & attentive Xiaoming & Sharon are a bonus too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104858360089906658544/reviews
