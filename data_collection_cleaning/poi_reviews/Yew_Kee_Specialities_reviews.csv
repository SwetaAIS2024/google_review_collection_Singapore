Ken Tan,4,Had the kway chap duck set.  Duck and accompanying ingredients Taste delicious.  The chilli also has its unique flavour.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100121205735734303463/reviews
Gohht 13,4,"Small stall, but happy to have this added alternative. Of course you can have better duck at the nearby restaurant, which is ex. Though price is still slightly higher than in the market, but given the location, i’m ok paying for it, which is alternative to paying for transport.

Lim Michael,2,"My wife ordered take out at about 6.20pm just now, i ate the food at about 7pm. The duck was generally ok, rice ok, chilli ok. BUT the big disappointment was the braised bean curd. It was sour!!!!!!!!!!

Why are you serving bean curd that has gone sour??!!!  Don't tell me it is a special bean curd. Don't tell me that it is mixed with pickles. Don't tell me that 40mins of traveling time made the bean curd sour!  I can clearly differentiate what is the sourness and smell coming from inside the bean curd as compared to pickle sauce.

Many months ago when you first started operations at Jurong Point, I was very happy. Food was great, portions were good. Crowd was good.... But look at you now........ My gosh.....  Your outlet is now so quiet.... Quality deteriorated. Value-for-money not anymore.

I sincerely hope the boss of this franchise is looking after the business well and is looking into operations and quality well. It seems on the ground (kitchen), things are not well!!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111043722060420935275/reviews
Chua Jason,1,Ordered duck porridge but was given little to no duck for $6. Asked for the serving size and they said brushed it off with “就是这样大“. Poor experience.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104343620808615867804/reviews
