The reviews speak for itself.
True customer service should not be making your customers wait when you are unsure of your policy and require quite some time to check.
The service attitude of the younger guy at the counter was pleasant, but I think the older guy showed quite a but of unpleasant attitude.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107643635105634420389/reviews

Xdd Shuaige,1,"The staff not the best. The q not clear. They just let ppl that queue and left, come back and go to the front again, even if there’s others that arrive alr. No q pole, no queue management. Only after we queue at where we think is right after a few minutes then they tell us we queue wrongly, need to queue all the way from the back when there were new customers, twice. Imagine asking us to requeue twice from the back just cause they didn’t share where the proper queue.

Also they won’t provide bags. Please bring your own.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118200494995391997118/reviews
