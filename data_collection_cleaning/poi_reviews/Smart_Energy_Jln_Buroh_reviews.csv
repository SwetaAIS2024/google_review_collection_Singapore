JJ Jen,4,"Good fuel price. Just a little troublesome with the process cos need to use their SMART card to activate pump at a machine first before u pump, then pay at the machine with the card. Need to top up the card using another machine inside. But once you get used to it, will be ok. There is a small eatery here too.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108529671565113161419/reviews
Gary Goh,1,"Fuel is cheap here But why open a cafe called Pit Stop where the coffee is very very diluted and tasteless. It’s shown on the board that they are selling fresh brewed coffee and I have feedback to the staff and she told me it is normal and that’s it. Therefore if not ready to provide charged coffee here, better don’t sell it. The staffs are mostly no available at the counter and have to press the bell to activated them. Maybe they are just making babies behind the counter? I hope they don’t.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115188000065458803058/reviews
TheSunMoon,5,"Petrol with good discount! Here's the process, that I encountered when signing up recently:

1) Register for a card at the counter, $5. Needs ID, and it says valid for 5 years (website says membership is for lifetime, need to clarify)
Discount at 28.75% at the moment!

2) Top-up card at the machine, minimum in card must be $20 to activate the pump. Using credit card to top-up, min $150 for the transaction. Nets, cash also available.

3) Outside will have a grey machine. Place your card to activate the pump number.

4) Pump as required, then head back to the grey machine to make payment.

Easy! All made easy to the staffs that guide the customers along the way.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102335495113025062858/reviews

Kamal Kamal,5,"Very helpful, fast and efficient staff. It was my first time here and the indoor staff (an indian man) guided me in setting up my card and membership. He patiently showed me how to top up the card before handing me over to the outdoor staff (an elderly chinese man). The outdoor staff guided me on the pump payment procedures with clear instructions. Ouh and the petrol is cheappppp!! Definitely coming here again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100564589290046623024/reviews
