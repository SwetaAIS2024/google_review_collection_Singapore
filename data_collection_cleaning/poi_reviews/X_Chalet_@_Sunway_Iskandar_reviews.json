Need to have big heart to prepare for the sudden animals wake up call. Be prepare to be a non-enviromental friendly person if not you can enjoy free sauna in the your room. The bed is also super comfortable and big compare to standard if you believe so. Anyway don't plan to have a good night rest if only you able to knock yourself out by some other mean.üòè",

      "text": "1. The cleanliness needs significant improvement.\n\n2. Due to the humidity, the floor feels sticky and damp, making it uncomfortable to walk barefoot. I recommend providing disposable slippers for guests if you prefer they don‚Äôt enter with shoes on.\n\n3. The place has a natural vibe ‚Äì you can hear birds in the morning and insects at night. However, it‚Äôs hard to rest or sleep because the peacock‚Äôs calls are so loud they wake you up, and you can also hear people playing with go-karts past midnight. I suggest setting limits on activity times to avoid disturbing guests, as it feels like we're paying to be inconvenienced and torture ourselves.\n\n4. It‚Äôs not close to the city center, and it‚Äôs not cheap to stay here. All the activities require additional fees, so if you're not interested in participating, it can be quite boring . You‚Äôll need to come up with your own entertainment. If you‚Äôre interested in the activities (which you can find on their website), you may want to consider staying elsewhere and driving here, as there are no special discount for overnight guests, and you won‚Äôt be able to get a good night‚Äôs sleep.\n\nOhya, no fridge inside the chalet and no BBQ facility too.",
