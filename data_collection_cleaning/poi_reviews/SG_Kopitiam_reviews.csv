Dhian Utama,5,"This hawker's position is close to the head office and has an outlet selling halal food, namely nasi lemak ayam taliwang. It seems that this outlet also has a branch in Lau Pa Sat. Have you ever tasted it there? Purchases or payments can only be cashless because there doesn't seem to be an option for cash. So far the grilled chicken is big and still delicious. The chili sauce is also spicy mayan. Try if you want to eat here, before work break time because it will be busy and the queue will be quite long",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110838839580336384029/reviews
