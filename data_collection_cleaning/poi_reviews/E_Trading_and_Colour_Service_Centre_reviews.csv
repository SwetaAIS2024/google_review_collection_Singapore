Josephine Lim,1,"I was surprise that printing cost has increase that much.
Printing from email additional $1 on top of printing 1 piece non colour (BW) which cost $0.80.
Meaning if print 1 copy BW from email will cost u $1.80.

If u want to save $1, remember to save to thumb drive.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115658275549058561975/reviews
James Chan,1,Do not ever collect your parcel from here. I had 5 parcels to collect and she only passed me 4. When I asked her if she could check if she still had another of my parcel she started screaming at me saying it's not her problem and that I was in the wrong. I tried explaining to her but she just started screaming at me more. Shoppe shows the parcel has been collected and I've double checked my items. Some serious attitude problems.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116255115716670746748/reviews
