lontongstroong,3,"The spiced peanut sauce, although having a very nice mouthfeel and texture, is a bit too sweet to my liking. The content variety and quality are just okay but during my visit the tempeh seemed to be not in the best condition (though still perfectly edible). Perhaps I came at the wrong timing.

Chiming from other prior comments, I wish the pricing could've been more honest. Bought 5 pieces (like medu vada, fish cake, egg vada kind of stuffs, no 'fancy' items like beef lung) and charged $7 even though the seller initially said it was $5.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews

Alvin Mah,1,"This will be my last time patronising this stall due to their exorbitant prices and dishonesty. I got a plate of Indian rojak with 3 items (potato, fishcake & tau hu) and was asked to pay $8! Thinking that probably due to inflation, I continued with my order. To my surprise, when I received my dish, I found my potato had shrinked by half the size. I questioned them to check if they left it out by mistake, and they can tell me that the potato is small sized. Knowing that it is fruitless arguing, I walked away.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101731562623200370370/reviews
