Didn‚Äôt want to give advice at first when we were choosing the medicine for our child, told us to ask the man in charge there, so we didn‚Äôt bother her. After a while she started to recommend a cough mixture, but I didn‚Äôt buy and bought something else instead, as I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with a medicine that I have not seen before.  She got offended and told us off rudely! She told us, ‚ÄúI already told you this medicine is good, you don‚Äôt believe me, and why you act as if I‚Äôm bluffing you?‚Äù As a customer, I didn‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt have the rights to choose what to buy. Amazing customer service!",
