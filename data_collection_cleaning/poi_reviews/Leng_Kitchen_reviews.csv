H W,5,"One of my favourite fish soup!
Default don‚Äôt have, bitter-ground, I added myself. Hehehe.. very affordable and the portion is big.

I love their Lor Mee, which is only available on Mon, Wed, and Friday.
Must eat! You can add your garlic and vinegar yourself at your preference.

Today just tried the curry chicken, also very nice!
I think curry chicken only available on Tues, Thurs, and Sat.

The cook really put heart in cooking, almost everything from this stall are taste guaranteed.
Super recommend if you happen nearby.
