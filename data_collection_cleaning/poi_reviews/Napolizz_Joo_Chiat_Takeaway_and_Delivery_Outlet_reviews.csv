clara chan,4,We ordered delivery. Frutti Di Mare tasted a bit dry. Would be better if the tomato base is thicker.  Gnocchi was yummy. Still hot when it arrived. Tiramisu is good.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113813530240444768986/reviews
Basil Chua,4,Awesome pizza as always and love the box design. I do think that the ingredients seemed to have been dramatically reduced this time. But it is still our favourite üçï pizza. Hope someone at the restaurant is reading this.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113248174520536231308/reviews
Angeline Chan,4,"I ordered the Napolizz pizza, and it tasted great, although there were a few things that were slightly disappointing - (1) the egg yolk had broken when it arrived and was running everywhere in the box and also into the plastic bag it came in :( (2) I wasn‚Äôt able to taste the Gorgonzola cheese, which was actually part of the reason why I ordered this pizza, but the taste of the pizza itself was nice nonetheless

The calamari rings were the ones that were kind of disappointing, both in quantity and the lack of crispiness (which may have been affected due to the fact it‚Äôs delivered).

In a nutshell, love the pizza (crust, toppings, their ratio) and would highly recommend it, but unfortunately not so much so for the calamari rings",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114512971327783854100/reviews
SG zozo,4,"Its a little hard to find. the pizza taste above average. certainly better than the fast food chains. not really value for money for the ingredients or taste, but at least it wasn't a tiny pizza. easy to order and friendly staff on the phone.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116127190744606427113/reviews
