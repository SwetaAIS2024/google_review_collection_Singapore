      "text": "When I walked in, it wasnâ€™t the typical cocktail bar vibe Iâ€™m used to. It felt more like a spot where people crack open bottles and discuss business deals. ðŸ˜… But hey, two things stood out: first, they have happy hour until 10 PMâ€”two drinks for $30, which is pretty decent. Plus, the alcohol was strong enough to feel like youâ€™re getting your moneyâ€™s worth! Second, they offer unlimited snacks in bags that you can help yourself to. Who needs to order food when you can snack endlessly, right? That said, if youâ€™re feeling peckish, they serve food from the Wine & Chef restaurant next doorâ€”and trust me, their kitchen is solid!",

He made patrons feel welcome with his witty chats.\n\nThe place has a relaxing vibe, with soft background music playing that wasnâ€™t too overpowering so that conversations could still take place.\n\nThe cocktail was reasonable priced at 2 for $30 during happy hour. Personally I found the drinks to be a little too heavy on the syrup. Could consider making them less sweet so that they would be more enjoyable.",
