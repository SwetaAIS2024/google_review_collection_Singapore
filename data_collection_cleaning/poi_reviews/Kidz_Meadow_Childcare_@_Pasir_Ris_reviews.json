      "text": "Teachers, across all levels, are caring, loving and gentle when handling the children. They also display a positive, cheery outlook when receiving students in the mornings, and send off the students lovingly at dismissal. They would know the names of most, if not all, of the students, creating a healthy bond between students and teachers.\nThe Nature Magnified curriculum is also interesting and teaches the students to be more respectful and appreciative of nature.",

I’m very thankful for Kidz Meadow as the school not only taught my girls academic bt also helps her in her well being. Through Kidz Meadow, my girl is able to have self confidence and express herself better. Her social skills were honed and she was able to help others when in need.",
