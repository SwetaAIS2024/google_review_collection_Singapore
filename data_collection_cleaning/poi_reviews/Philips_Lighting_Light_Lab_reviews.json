Clement was there to serve me and explain to me they are still setting up the showroom. Apparently, they will be showcasing more products other than Philips products soon. Such as Haiku fan, Bertazzoni and etc. They are not doing retailing at this moment.\n\nI suggest to visit in another few weeks when more products are being showcase!\n\nClement is friendly, courteous and knowledgeable!",

Based on our past experience, we’ve just purchased a large batch of the recently released 400 lumen GU10 Hue bulbs and are looking forward to having them installed.",

He is extremely patient and has great product knowledge. Best of all he understands our need to explain and recommend the right lighting products. No pressure to buy; in fact he helped me to navigate to the online retailer to compare the prices. Clement is indeed an asset to Philips Singapore.",
