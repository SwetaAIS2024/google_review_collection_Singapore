Daniel,3,"Small, compact , packed. What do you do if you want to go to the library to sit down read a book, but all chairs are taken? Collection is also pretty basic and rather limited. Not many new books.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108535088959947816396/reviews
Joshua Chew,5,"The librarian and staff were helpful and assisted me to locate the books that I wanted. The variety of books is decent since the size of the library isn't really big. The library is conductive enough for studying and there are rooms available to  use your computers. It would be good if all desks had changing ports for convenience. Nevertheless, the library is quite a good option to study as well. What caught my eyes was this machine that is able to dispense cards by redeeming some points. I think this machine has been here for quite a long time and there are kids crowding there every time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100928805220966571942/reviews
