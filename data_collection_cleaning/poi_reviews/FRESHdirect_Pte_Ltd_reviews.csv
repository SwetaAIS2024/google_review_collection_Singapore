A U,1,"My first order with them, was curious to check the quality of their items. The time slots you can choose are days distance and when they finally sent me the order, some items were missing and others were spoiled.
I sent them an email reporting this and checked their FAQs as well, and guess what: they only refund you in store credits, on your next order, which cannot be less than 50$!!

“Good” strategy, freshdirect: always make sure your orders contain spoiled or missing items in order to ensure people will have re-purchase from you for minimum 50$ unless they are willing to take the hit (in my case, 11$ worth of loss). That’s not the way to create loyalty.. terrible experience.
