The desserts were a real highlight, and I absolutely loved them! The service and environment were both decent as well, making it a nice meal to celebrate.",

      "text": "Had lunch at 1.15pm on 12 May, Vesak Day and Peking duck was already unavailable. It’s a public holiday and I’m shocked the restaurant ran out of Peking duck one hour into lunch service. The place was only half full.\n\nManagement declined the use of my $20 voucher for my $234 bill although it was not stated in the T&Cs that it can’t be used on a PH. Seems like they just decided on a whim to decline it without proper protocols on its usage, as they didn’t provide any other explanation aside from “today is a special occasion”.\n\nOverall standard of food seems to have dropped from what I remember (last visit here was 2 years ago).\n\nThe good - service staff are helpful and attentive in recommending dishes. Ambience is nice and elegant. My favourite dish was the eggplant & long beans.\n\nOverall it was still a disappointing experience though and I won’t be returning, will also no longer recommend this restaurant for Chinese food given the others that have popped up recently.",
