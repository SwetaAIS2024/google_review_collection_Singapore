Elle-E,5,"Dropped in on a Saturday early pm when I was looking for a place to do some work (and feeling too cold for Starbucks at fusionopolis where I usually go and grumpy that huggs next door stopped taking favepay).

Guy at the counter was helpful with drink recommendations, and later with topping up my water, offering to add ice to my remaining un-iced americano and sending a glass of ice tea during the ~1+ hr I was there.

Notwithstanding that I was the only one sitting there for a long time (and I made sure to check closing hours after he said the ice tea was the remaining to finish for the day).

Probably the best service I've received at a coffee place and the most well used $5+. Will def drop by again",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102857807741981465992/reviews
Skye Cai,5,"Ordered the latte and the pour over as well as the black.
The latte is very smooth with the hot milk. The milk form on top is just nice. Creamy and soft.
The Floripondio pour over is great. The taste is clean and fruity. Lychee taste developed at the end of the taste note.
The long black is quite normal.
Service is normal.
Location is easy to find.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Fiona,5,"Great quality coffee and knowledgeable staffs!

Had the flat white which uses their Gachala bean and layering extraction for a sweeter cup.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109838631753779355363/reviews
Waterfront 99,3,"Ordered latte for takeaway, coffee is weak and can only taste the milk.
Had it once at Vivo outlet before and remember the latte to be much better. Not sure if it was due to a different blend used.

Royal Pears,4,"Good coffee. This latest cup, made using the Gachala house blend of Colombia Garzon microlot and Guatemala Santa Isabel, had a chocolaty, nutty flavour with a medium body. However, the flavour wasnâ€™t as good as their Super Seven blend of Mexico Guadelupe Zaju and Colombia Tablon de Gomez, which was available in an earlier visit. The cup of Super Seven had good aroma and a robust, balanced, fruity flavour with a medium body, good texture, and a rum aftertaste. Uses Meiji milk.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108275532362304111934/reviews
