Ashlynn Ang,5,"My son has been attending preschool in Kinderland Revenue House since he was 18 month-old. So far so good. I really appreciated the teachers' support (Ms Eileen and Ms Wang) back then when I told them my boy is toilet trained so no diapers when he's awake. The teachers never complained about the ""accidents"" and just changed him whenever it happened. He comes home happy, sharing his day in school with me. The teachers are kind and attentive. The school also has lotsa activities to keep the children engaged. I'm also enrolling my daughter in the school next year! üòÑ",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101170402167692996288/reviews

Choy Tze Wei,5,"My husband and I decided to enrol our children (now 3 and 5 yrs old) at Kinderland Revenue House since i work nearby and it has by far been the best decision ever! Every single school staff has been wonderful - from the friendly Principal Ms Sherlyn who knows all the children by name, nurturing/patient teachers and Ms Suzanne, to the smiley and sweet Aunty who prepares the kids meals. My children enjoy going to school, and come home everyday with a sparkle in their eyes and lots of stories to share about their day. If I have to be honest, the biggest reason why I hesitate to change jobs is because I simply cannot bear the thought of making my kids switch schools. ü§£ A big thank you for taking such great care of all the children! ‚ù§Ô∏è",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100231947614605951466/reviews
Scott,5,"I have 2 kids and both of them have been with Kinderland for several years now. I will like to thank all of the teachers for all the hard work in caring for my children. A lot of work, patience and effort has gone into caring for the young ones, and on top of that, the Principal (Ms. Sherlyn) and her team has gone above and beyond.

I just went for a Father's Day event organised by the school. It was a very meaningful way to spend some quality time with the kids, and for a good cause. Essentially the school had organised a supermarket visit for the fathers and their child/children, to buy some essentials for some old folks.

The logistics must have been a nightmare (with so many parents and children, and I am sure there must be some difficult parents!). I personally thought it was very well managed despite the challenges! Seeing the teachers do their utmost best to make the event a success (which was!) certainly gave me confidence that my wife and I made the right decision to place our kids with Kinderland!

Thank You to the Principal and Teachers for the awesome work, and for caring for our children, and other children, and touching their lives on a daily basis. I am glad that my kids are in Kinderland, and they certainly enjoy their time in school with the teachers and their friends!

Teaching is a noble profession, and I am glad that my kids are the receivers of such great care from a very professional team!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111498094471411125675/reviews
