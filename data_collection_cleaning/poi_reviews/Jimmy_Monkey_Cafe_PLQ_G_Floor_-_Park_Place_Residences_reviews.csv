Nigel Chua,5,"Jimmy Monkey @ PLQ2

Is a great place for early playground and breakfast with the kids. The playground is just next to Jimmy monkey so it's easy to keep an eye on the kids but take note the playground can be for bigger kids around 5+ years old

It's my first time eating their food there but goodness, their fries crunch was spot on, the deep fried pork belly was succulent (nice when paired with their spicy chilli dip)

The burger was a little too meaty (I will get them to put in more fats ratio) and their cheese toasty was wonderful for me (my kids didn't like it)

Overall, scores really high on a will-we-go-back-again",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112733354418751192764/reviews
Di,2,"I would not recommend this place.

It is just right to the playground, BUT the overall experience is very poor. Pick any other of the places around.
The kids' menu looks interesting until you see what it is. The 4 star rating I saw when I came here is way too generous (perhaps friends and family).
Not to mention, there is a generous service charge automatically that is absolutely unjustified. The food is mediocre at best. The bread slice you see was supposed to be a pizza.

I would never come here again",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111837649020382277488/reviews
Julia Foo,4,"Nice and spacious, felt pretty cooling despite it being outdoor seating. Opted for the eggs and toast- scrambled eggs were a tad dry but the add-on tomatoes were lovely! Kudos also to the staff who kindly gave me a fresh cuppa after a moth jumped into my half-drunk cup",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116423688934757822949/reviews
Zhansulu Abisheva,5,"I have no idea why there were so little people, but this place is awesome.
Outdoors and nice cross wind, close to the road yet quite hidden from outside walkers, green, nice music playing, a playground to let your rascals play before food comes, ambience is great in general. Food was not bad, beer and drinks menu is good too.
Definitely 9/10 experience.
Going to make this place as my go-to place when I'm near Paya Lebar.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117802854285562906867/reviews
Jacob Nes,5,"Had a wonderfully made healthy brunch on a public holiday while the kiddos played their hearts out safely at the sizable playground right beside Jimmy Monkey. Eyes on them while I munched my breakie in peace!

While the cafe was pretty crowded, the lady boss kindly helped to shuffle some furniture around so I got a decent table. Had a great morning!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112119048163004392224/reviews
