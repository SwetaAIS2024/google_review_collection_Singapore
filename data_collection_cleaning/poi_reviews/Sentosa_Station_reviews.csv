Andy Smith,4,"The Sentosa cable car is worth doing as a round trip. We just went in a circle and did not get off. The views are really good, especially of Sentosa itself. You can clearly see the roller coasters in Universal Studios.
Its easy to walk up to the cable car from Universal or the centre of Sentosa, its basically escalators most of the way. Gives you some unique perspectives on Singapore and the bay.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107857522709992095490/reviews
Mayank Pandey,4,"Has the basic amenities needed to get you in the cable car - eating options, seating areas, gift shop (which you can't avoid), ticket counter, and staff to help you get into the cable car. The station is built at a height, so if you have time, check out the views. You can walk up from Imbiah Lookout station but note its a steep climb but not too long.

Station area was clean when we visited and was running Pikachu-themed cars. While the instructions said the car has to be shared among 8 people, every group was allowed to have their own one. Maybe because there were not that many of us.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107162993305909069490/reviews
Scribbling Geek,4,"Easy station to navigate, with both boarding and disembarking gates connected to the gift shop. The gift shop here is also larger than the one over at Mount Faber Station, with more selection of souvenirs. A Starbucks outlet is part of the station and right before the station is SkyHelix Sentosa.

For those switching to the Sentosa Cable Car line, Imbiah Lookout Station is 1-2 minutes away. Exit Sentosa Station and make a right, then head downhill. Way is clearly marked.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111562642484326521942/reviews
