Different types of seating available for a coffee date, a group catch up, or an important meeting. Pleasant and friendly staff. Overall a lovely place to enjoy great coffee.",

Had a chance to be in my Zen moment before my driving test.\n\nThe white coffee was well made, creamy and smooth, right amount of bitterness.\n\nThey were very generous with the egg mayo as well.\n\nIt's also very near cdc driving center (5min walk), perfect to go before every lesson and test.",

Food isn’t made on site. But it is quite yummy. And everything is very well priced.\n\nThis cafe is in the lobby of Aspial One. If you’re in the Ubi area, this is possibly one of the best cafes you can visit. Recommend!",
