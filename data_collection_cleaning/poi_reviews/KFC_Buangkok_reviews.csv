Jynz,5,"The staff there are so friendly and cheerful. Especially the cashier staff, Lina and the kitchen staff, Ng Lee Hiang. They are so patient and their customer service are good also. They will apologize for the waiting time and reasure you that they are processing your order. Lina is also being honest that she does not have a good memory and will forget if the order are too large, however she will double and triple check on your order to make sure there are no missing items.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107129083647362878312/reviews
Junxi,1,"Have plenty of experiences with this branch, some times good, some times bad(maybe because of the peak hour/what not)

Today's experience is just borderline the worst. Purposely avoided the peak hours to made an order and got cheese fries without the cheese. The amount is so miniscule that a packet of chilli sauce would have more cheese then what was provided. (If i could attach a picture here i would)

Apart from apologies no service recovery was done.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100524985627676235035/reviews
