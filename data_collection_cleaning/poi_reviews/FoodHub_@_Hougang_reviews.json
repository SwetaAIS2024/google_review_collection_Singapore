The noodles were absolutely tasteless and the soup was just as bland as the aforementioned man's service.\n\nThe auntie drink server was rude. Very certain this auntie has spotted us but chose to ignore us when we tried to order drinks from her. When she sees other customers taking their seats, she goes over quickly to serve them.",

Hor fun was insipid and there were only a few pathetic slices of fish. After a few bites, we had to throw away our food. Unfortunately the awful after taste lingered. Simply disgusting.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COST.",
