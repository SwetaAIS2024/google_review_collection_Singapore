Miles Macdonald,4,"I was quite surprised at how large this garden is. I was expecting just a few plants, but there are very many here organised in groupings based on what body system the plant is supposed to help, eg, respiratory & circulatory systems, Reproductive system etc. Information boards tell you about each plant and its health benefits. This is a very interesting garden, the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't have the beautiful visual impact which you get from the colourful Orchid garden.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112943810663501022344/reviews
