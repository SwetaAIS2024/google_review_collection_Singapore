Mason Tay,3,"The reviews and ratings already tell you everything you need to know. While the decor is undeniably relaxing and stylish, the food is a complete disaster. Do yourself a favor—do not order anything to eat unless you enjoy deep regret. The only redeeming item was the milk tea with grass jelly, which was just average. A hard pass for food lovers.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108195777674730720034/reviews
Selvinia Nofy,5,"In terms of food, I found it pretty average, I’ve visited three times and tried a few different dishes. The service truly impressed me! The staff are so friendly and always eager to help. Plus, the place is clean and has a nice, quiet atmosphere, which makes it a pleasant spot to enjoy a meal.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102676437011264302982/reviews

Gator,4,"The family visited this restaurant for dinner two days ago. We managed to get our seats easily as there wasn’t a crowd when we visited. We were a party of 7.

Ordered some of the local dishes like the fried mee Siam, chicken briyani, local Kaya butter toasts, fried rice, noodle soup and chicken chop.

All the food was good especially the fried rice. But the briyani rice could be better. The chicken was also not hot enough on the briyani. Interestingly the Kaya was good and we bought 5 more tins after our meal. Prices were reasonable and the services ok only.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
