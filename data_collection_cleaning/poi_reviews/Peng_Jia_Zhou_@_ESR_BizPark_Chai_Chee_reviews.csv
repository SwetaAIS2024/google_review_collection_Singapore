Wei,5,"Visited this stall because you can customize your own ingredients. Loved how everything was neatly displayed, making it easy to DIY your bowl. I chose prawn, pork, scallop, liver, and prawn paste. The porridge had a great texture—not too thick or watery—and was nicely savory. Ingredients were fresh and flavorful. Everything was well-cooked and satisfying. Overall, a great bowl of porridge and worth the visit if you enjoy picking your own toppings.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106857427212997686613/reviews
Jorynn Tan,5,"Had a wonderful family lunch at Peng Jia Zhou. This was our first time trying a DIY porridge concept, and it did not disappoint. The variety of ingredients you can choose from is impressive — from fresh seafood balls to savory meats — allowing you to craft your own perfect bowl of comforting porridge, tailored exactly to your taste.

The porridge itself was silky, warm, and so satisfying, but the side dishes really took our meal to the next level. We had the fried intestines, spicy pi dan (century egg), crispy fried pork, and the classic you tiao (dough fritters). Everything each packed with flavor and cooked to perfection.

Definitely to visit again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103641131822855603540/reviews
YH - foodlesstravelled,5,"At Peng Jia Zhou, you can customise your own porridge ingredients at $5/100g, and they have a wide variety of ingredients as well.

Other than pork liver, minced pork, pork slices, pig intestine and dory fish, they also had ingredients such as prawns, lala, prawn paste, pork paste, mixed (pork prawn) paste, scallops, beef slices and more! The porridge is complimentary with the ingredients and add ons are S$0.50 each - egg, century egg or salted egg.

We tried their prawn paste, pork paste, mixed paste, prawns, scallops, lala, beef slices, pig intestine, egg and century egg. All of the ingredients were fresh, I thought that the paste ingredients (prawn, pork, mixed) were interesting offerings and flavourful on their own, but felt that the other ingredients enhanced the flavour of the porridge more (the scallops in particular were pretty sweet).

They also have a variety of side dishes to accompany your porridge, we tried their:

Fried Intestine (S$6.90) - these mini pieces were crunchy and nice, sweet and pretty addictive!

Hakka Style Fried Pork (S$5.90) - well flavoured thanks to the fermented bean curd batter, for those who love fatty pork slices - this is it.

Golden You Tiao (S$0.80/pc) - as a you tiao lover, I thought that this was humongous and quite worth it for the price (it may be short, but it’s really fat).

All of the side dishes were freshly fried, crispy and tasty, would recommend having them fresh! Although I got quite thirsty after the meal. It was fairly crowded when we visited on a weekend dinner, and the queue took a while to clear (but the dishes were served considerably fast).

raymysterio,5,"Peng Jia Zhou, a new DIY congee spot in Singapore, offers an innovative take on traditional porridge. Located at ESR BizPark in Bedok, this eatery allows customers to customize their congee with 16 different fresh ingredients, priced at S$5 per 100g. The congee itself is well-balanced in flavor, with ingredients cooked to perfection. A standout feature is their freshly made you tiao (S$0.80 per piece), fried to order and deliciously crispy.
Pang’s Century Egg (S$5.90) is available as a side dish at Peng Jia Zhou. Century eggs typically have a creamy, custard-like yolk with a rich, indulgent mouthfeel and a complex flavor profile combining sweetness, earthiness, and umami. The egg white transforms into a jelly-like texture with a savory, slightly smoky taste.
The Hakka Style Fried Pork (S$5.90) is another popular side dish at Peng Jia Zhou. Hakka fried pork is known for its crispy exterior and tender, juicy interior. The dish is typically made by marinating pork in fermented bean curd before frying, resulting in a flavorful crust with a slight pungency. The combination of crispy skin, moist meat, and a layer of fat creates a delightful texture and taste experience.
Overall, Peng Jia Zhou offers an affordable and customizable congee experience with tasty side dishes, making it an exciting new addition to Singapore’s food scene",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103714528289032514319/reviews

The slow-cooked pork broth creates a smooth, flavorful base, and the sides like Hakka Fried Pork and Pang’s Century Egg (with a subtle spice kick!) take it to the next level. The service is fast, and the quality is top-notch. A must-try for porridge lovers and anyone looking for a fresh take on comfort food!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101820530424899244665/reviews
