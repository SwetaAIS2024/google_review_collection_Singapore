Their matcha is strong and unique creations are definitely worth a try.\n\nKnocking off a star for the price—you’ll definitely feel it in your wallet, with a base (Nishioo) iced oat matcha latte costing $9.90. Easily one of the priciest spots in One-North, though the quality does hold up.",

      "text": "A cosy establishment setup in Galaxis, they sell a variety of matcha drinks that are earthy and delicious. If you are a matcha fan, it's a place you should definitely try out.\n\nA unique attraction of the store comes from their staff making matcha, including the whisking process, by the front window. This means you get to witness the matcha making process while you are waiting for your drinks to be served, adding on to the dining experience.\n\nThe matcha itself is creamy, earthy, and thick without feeling overpowering. The latte version blends the milk well with the matcha, too.\n\nA must visit, in my opinion! Do note that seats are rather limited due to the small size of the store. 8/10",
