Angel Cheong,3,"I love the pork leg vinegar, there is plenty of ginger in it and is spicy. Portion of meat is average. For the dish cai xin with beef, the beef is tender. I super love this dessert pandan blue pea flower milk pudding, the pandan taste is very strong and flavourful.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106414060291768557647/reviews
Yan,4,"Good quality food. Apparently no MSG in their soups (verify with the owner!). Recommended: Ngoh hiang, claypot rice, otah egg, prawn paste chicken, grass jelly drink. We enjoyed our meal there. Note that it’s non air conditioned, industrial coffee shop environment. Sufficient fans to keep the place well ventilated and cool. We had to swat a fly away while eating.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118426666292019553039/reviews
Arnold K H Tan,5,"Food is excellent value for money. The Crispy Pork knuckle is not flavoured, but pairs well with the simple slightly sour sauce + salsa. Ngoh hiang was good with the dipping sauce.

Claypot rice is cooked to order, hence takes time, so order this first, before deciding on other dishes.

A big bonus is no MSG added, so you won't have that thirsty throat-feel after a meal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114671367458949009476/reviews
Quak Yong Sheng,5,"Went during dinner on a weekday and I have no complains with the service or food.

Ordered the claypot rice and the char was on point and not too much salty fish which was positive for me. Waiting time was mentioned to be about 20 mins and was still acceptable for us.

The hot plate tofu don’t really look good but it sure is tasty!
Ordered also the Yangzhou fried rice and again it doesn’t look appetising but the taste and rice texture was good.

Well I was too engrossed to start the meal and didn’t took the photo of its presented state

Overall will come back again if I crave for claypot rice",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103217106641392558942/reviews
