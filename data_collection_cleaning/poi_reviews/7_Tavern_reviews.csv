Daniel Bok,5,Came on a quiet Wednesday night. The staff are very friendly. This bar is good to hang for drinks and all. It’ll get a little loud when the band plays (they’re only playing from Thursday night onwards and the bar will be really popping the).,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114835379352368094009/reviews

Justin Goh,2,"Call in and told them I will be there in 30 mins and ask if there was table available. The answer was yes. When I got there I waited another 10mins to get my table. Eventually I got the table. After receiving my drink in 10mins, which was fast considering they were busy. After 15mins or some I was asked if I was leaving soon bcos the person on the call said I will be staying for only 30mins. Like why would anyone stay for 30mins only at the place where live band was playing. After consideration, they asked if I would like to share table instead, in my mind it was bad already. Nevertheless, music was good just this miscommunication made the experience very bad.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108983597279291363514/reviews
Stella Tan,5,"What an amazing place filled with such warmth, great service and fantastic food. The chicken herbal soup was absolutely SPOT ON, bursting with robust flavours that go so well with a bowl of rice.

The staff and owners are welcoming, making this place feels so much more than just a place to have food and drinks. It truly feels like coming home to a safe place.

Will definitely return to try their ever-changing seasonal menu!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808861546380081108/reviews
