Samantha H,1,"Used to visit this place since at least 10 years ago, and the male shifu was good.

However, the price increased tremendously (500%!) recently. I made an appt with the male shifu (per usual), yet when I arrived apparently I was seeing the 2 females. The tuina was painful (in a good way), however she didn't manage to 推 the pain point like the male did.

I also felt like some treatments were being pushed onto me. Overall very disappointing and I will be finding a new TCM for future injuries.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111573813017335252843/reviews
Elijah,5,"Had a pretty bad (3rd) relapse of an old injury, lower back L1S5 slipped disc, while I was working out at the gym. I could barely walk at the point of time.

Immediately called & booked an appointment with Wang Lei (TuiNa Therapist) because I knew he was the one who can be counted on.

Had 2 sessions with him over a course of 1 week. All healed.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102143686448293723939/reviews
Suet Yuet,5,"Had a suspected case of pinched nerve in shoulder which caused excruciating pain radiating down to elbow and visited Song Ting TCM for second opinion. (I had gone to a popular TCM group earlier in the week where I was diagnosed with tennis elbow despite me telling that the pain was from shoulder.)

Had a tuina session with Song Ting and came away feeling so much more relieved of my pain. During the session, Dr Wang explained possible cause of the pain, gave advice, engaged in conversation to distract from the pain.

Would highly recommend him because he is driven by medical ethics to heal and relieve people of their pain.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108616178000826418837/reviews
Ertugrul Gazi,1,"Passed by and noticed their advert stating that they do neck and shoulder massage. When I opened the door, some lady sitting there said ‘malay ren’; as if I don’t know mandarin; presumably cause I was wearing a Jubbah. Didn’t see why that’s a problem. Was taken aback so I left the door open ajar and walked back out. That lady was looking at me, dumbfounded I might add. I entered and asked again politely whether they do neck and shoulder massage. Some fella appeared from the inside and stared blankly at me and asked the lady sitting there what I wanted (in mandarin). At this point, it was obvious that I wasn’t welcome. He informed that lady just say no to him (in mandarin). That fella gestured to me ‘no no’ thereafter, with broken english he then said ‘no people’. Doesn’t take genius to figure out the cockamamie here.

So, if you’d like to experience racial profiling and discreet racism. This seems like the perfect setting. Why bother advertising when you don’t even offer such services? Also, most of us know mandarin so try to be more creative when stereotyping.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104739224745408989396/reviews
PS,1,"Used to be reasonable price and effective. Nowadays jack up the price and keep pushing his other service like acupuncture and etc.

He will try to justify his expensive price for upholding the TCM reputation which is rubbish in my opinion.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104356140836313473956/reviews
