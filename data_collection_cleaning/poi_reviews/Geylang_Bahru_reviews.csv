Eileen Ong,5,"The station master Singarayer Darren Shailendran of Geylang Bahru MRT station is most helpful. I was trying to get a map of 175 bus from Pasir Panjang from his colleague when Mr Darren approached me with a MRT map. He taught me how to  travel in the shortest time possible from Pasir Panjang to Geylang. I really appreciate his help. So far he is the best station master I have met.
Yours sincerely
