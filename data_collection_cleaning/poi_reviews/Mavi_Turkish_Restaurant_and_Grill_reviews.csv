Eyogurt,4,"Food is nice, service is excellent. However, food took some time to be served although only serving 1-2 tables during weekend lunch time. Aircon is sufficient during mid afternoon.
We went there with Eatigo reservation with 50% on food. So the price is reasonable; but discount is not applicable for drinks.
Will I be back? Yes, if with discount.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109684219816059430699/reviews
Danel Maderazo,2,"We weren’t happy with the food when we tried this restaurant. The staff is really nice and accommodating; however, it took almost an hour and a half before completing our order. There is a room for improvement, but for this price point, I wouldn’t recommend it for first timers trying out Turkish dish. I will change my review if we would dine in here again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101432381469146020801/reviews

Olivia Lee,5,"This restaurant is located in the heart of Hajilane, one of the trendiest areas around. The interior is cool and comfortable, and the staff are incredibly friendly.
The hummus, which I tried for the first time, had a rich, nutty flavor. The baklava was just the right amount of sweet, and the pistachios added a perfect texture. I was completely blown away by the Turkish coffee—it was absolutely delicious.
The prices were reasonable, and this place is a must-visit if you're ever in Singapore.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117008175410217133941/reviews
