Their broth is light, flavorful, and not oily‚Äîperfect if you‚Äôre craving something wholesome.\n\nHighlights?\nThe tenderloin pork claypot(fall-apart soft!)\nFish soup (clean and aromatic)\nand Kai Lan (crisp and fresh).\nOh, and free unlimited soup refills! ü•£\n\nTheir portions lean petite, so order a spread to share (or double down on favorites!).\n\nThe vibe? Pure nostalgia‚Äîretro Singaporean caf√© charm with wooden stools and old-school tiles.\n\nA tasty, cozy dive into tradition! ü™ë",

      "text": "Frankly as a local, I don‚Äôt eat song fa bah kut teh. Only because foreign friends want to go, so I accommodate them.\n\nThe food is not more wow than it should be. I guess you can also laud it for consistency. It‚Äôs not any more or less tasty than how bah kuh teh is supposed to be. But of course you will be missing out if you didn‚Äôt order fried youtiao to dip the soup. Crunchy doughy and savory goodness.\n\nIt‚Äôs insanely crowded and the centre point branch also accommodates tour groups which adds to the chaos. Go at super early dinner like 5pm if you want to eat it even earlier on weekends.\n\nFor what we ordered, we paid like nearly $60 for 2 people. Not exactly cheap but not breaking the bank either.\nI guess if you‚Äôre a tourist and you want to try, sure, why not. But locals would find it madness to line up 45 min to an hour for this very regular food.\n\nUpdate: Jan 2025 service is quite slow. I experienced slow service also at another branch.\nI think they want to prep the whole order first before serving all at once but seriously customers are hungry / starving after Q-ing up so long, so why can‚Äôt you serve something first that‚Äôs ready to eat? Also frankly, the soup and pork ribs are all ready made, it‚Äôs able to serve it immediately.\nEven after instructing staff to bring something anything quick, it was ignored‚Ä¶. *rolls eyes*\n\nAnd the digital order system allows customers to order the paofan porridge alone but the staff later brings a card with exclusion clause saying you can‚Äôt do that, you MUST order a ‚Äúmain dish‚Äù with the Pao fan.\nGeez, put that restriction in the digital order, so customers can immediately know instead of ordering and have to edit order again‚Ä¶ I feel the whole system has much to be improved on ‚Ä¶\n\nbut on a positive note song fa is more affordable than some other bah kuh teh chain. And the cashier was quite flexible which I appreciate.",
