Genny Luo,5,"I had a very positive experience with Dr Lee and his team. Dr. Lee is takes the time to explain everything clearly, ensuring I fully understood my condition and treatment options. The procedures, including the scopes, were smooth and handled with great care.

The clinic staff were just as impressive. They took the initiative to list down important points for me to remember, scheduled future appointments efficiently, and provided useful reminders to keep me on track. The entire experience seamless and reassuring.

Highly recommend Dr. Lee and his team for anyone looking for excellent gut care!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115508705764750539971/reviews

Guowen zhang,5,"Dr Lee is skillful in Endoscopy and he also made sure the patient is well sedated during the procedure without any discomfort. He is also customer focused, knowing I am sensitive to standard sedation, he modified the sedation to make the procedure comfortable for me without major side effect after the procedure. Really appreciate the effort to make my latest procedure a smooth one.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112521841497982929983/reviews
