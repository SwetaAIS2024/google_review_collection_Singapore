Michelle Yeoh,5,"Located within 5 minutes walking distance from the Science Faculty, MPH and University Health Clinic. Takes around 10 minutes to reach UTown. The college has a thriving and vibrant community. Great vibes. It has its own dining hall, lounges, music room, meeting halls etc. Surrounded by lush greenery.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117223891734424870330/reviews
Agus Wiwanto,5,"Update 2022: the room is compact but comfortable, functional, well ventilated and well lit.
Looks comfortable from the outside. Because of the Covid restriction, I have not had the opportunity to see the inside yet.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110241388732088945315/reviews

Yong Jen Tang,5,"10/10 would recommend to incoming NUS freshmen. Great location for a NUS campus experience. Right in the heart of campus with bus services around and to Kent Ridge MRT. Close proximity to various canteens, sports facilities, health centre and exam venues (important for potential students!). Some aircon rooms available after recent upgrades and you can also bring in your own aircon if necessary. Getting to class when it rains is possible by foot. UTown is also great but when it rains you need to take a bus. And during peak periods you may not even be able to get on.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116109699339933697600/reviews
Tan Dei,1,Bad experience. The hostel officers there are not at all friendly. They don't bother to listen to your feedback. The toilets are always dirty and nobody wants to clean them.,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100532285486456006229/reviews
