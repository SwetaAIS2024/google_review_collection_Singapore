nadia jaafar,5,Bought their luscious lychee for my son's birthday. Tasted so good. Worry free as one of my boy cannot consume nuts while the other no eggs allowed. The JellyHearts has no nuts no egg.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102623918039846221671/reviews

Flo Yeow,4,"It's definitely a nice alternative to your usual cakes. Whether it's for birthday, events, or just because. The cheesecake layer is nice, coupled with the jelly like top, and that heart shaped fruit cut out. It definitely reminds me of childhood. I really like how their boxes are packaged, sturdy, does the job, and has all the descriptions printed on it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
