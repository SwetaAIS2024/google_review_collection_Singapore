Bhaskar Singapore,5,"Nice Singapore style Tea and Breakfast.

I like fried Egg and Spanish style Tomato üçÖ Omelette, Juicy and delicious.

It's open at 7am and very helpful for who comes to CBP early.

Service is excellent. I must give seven star rating for the staff here. Very patient, polite and hard working.

Usually Indians drink Tea or Coffee in less volume and this share the Tea like one by two and two by three.

Staff pretty much understand this requirement and share the Tea or Coffee accordingly and prepare so nicely.

I suggest to have tray  return area so that it will help to optimise seating and timing during lunch time and save time for staff as well.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118414779972405165627/reviews
Serence Playford,1,"This outlet was the quietest among all other branches which I‚Äôve observed.

Here‚Äôs probably why.

I‚Äôve been standing at the counter for past 5 mins, when the staff clearly saw me as I was behind the customer he was attending to for orders.

I‚Äôm fine with him attending to them after cashing out, at least let me know that I need to wait for more than 5 mins before he could attend to me as I was ready for the order.

Professionalism and Courtesy would be highly appreciated for this outlet staffs.

The vibes here a bit like totally no service, staffs chatting among themselves and relax one corner type.

When order is being made, they kinda of taking their own sweet time. Very much like any order = Bothering them.

However, this is not their business but their company instead. They still get paid for their slack of service which directly impact the co. Business of Han‚Äôs Cafe.

Will recommend to spend your money at other outlet instead for much better service & food quality standard.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108198237919660057756/reviews

We had breakfast platter and sunny side up with bacon sandwich.
1. Sausages is super bland. No taste at all
2. The cashier who trying to take my order. Halfway thru the order.. she can turn around and talk to her colleague at least twice. No matter what.. pls be professional n not hanging your customer half way..",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112403364679588575398/reviews
Poh Aaron,1,"not much has to be said just look at how unappetising the sauce and the vegetables look. vegetables had no taste at all soul that came taste like campbell. sauce looks disgusting, only good part of this meal was the coffee. 16 dollars for all this simply a scam",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111722466026448313126/reviews
Lucas Lim,1,"Waited 25min for agio olio during off peak at 3pm. Stood up to see the cook using her phone in the kitchen.

Agio Olio didn't season the noodles w salt, chilli added to agio olio too early making it mad spicy and tasteless. Seems like re-training is needed.
