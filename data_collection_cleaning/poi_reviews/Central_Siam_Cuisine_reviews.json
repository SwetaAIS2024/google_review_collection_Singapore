The waitress was friendly and efficient, although there was a slight wait for the food.\n\nThe boat noodles featured a rich and flavorful broth with tender meat and well-cooked noodles.\n\nThe crab meat omelette rice was also enjoyable, with a fluffy omelette containing a generous amount of sweet crab meat served over fragrant rice.\n\nOverall, Central Siam Cuisine is a good choice for straightforward and tasty Thai food.",
