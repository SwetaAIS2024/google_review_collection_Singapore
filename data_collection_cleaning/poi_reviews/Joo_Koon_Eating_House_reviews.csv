Mega Nathan,1,"I went to patronize at the drink stall at 7.15am, was a long Queue.

The Chinese female lady taking orders, shouted at me for order. I told her softly, pls don't shout and be rude. Subsequently she screamed and shouted you not happy go to coffeeshop and don't come here to buy. She is really sick. Hope I can meet the management and speak. She just embarrassed me early in the morning. Such a rude and rowdy behavior. I just pity her family members. I will never patronize here anymore. Definitely will report to the authorities. It's kinda of racism towards me.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116391117575168964722/reviews
