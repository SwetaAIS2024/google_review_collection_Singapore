Eddie Khoo,4,The roasted pork here are super crispy. You can hear the cracking sound while you chewing it. And is pretty economic and tastefully. Try it ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115081002864605824622/reviews
Vicki Loh,2,"We come here almost every week because of the children's activities.  Avoid the cai png stall like the plague. I went there 3 weeks in a row and ordered the same dishes (because the children are picky) but the price increased from 6, to 7 to eventually 10 dollars!  The following week, my dad paid 3.80 for the same dishes!  He speculated they are increasing price because the last 2 times I ordered I was using CDC vouchers.  I dont support dishonest hawkers and won't be ordered at the cai png stall again.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103149933532631702045/reviews

CT Low,2,"Zi char food is nice. Surely will return for food. But dunno why the music must be turned so loud. So loud to the extent it's disturbing. It's not good to have family dinner there. For this, will not return anymore. Da bao back maybe yes.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116303222971074382808/reviews
