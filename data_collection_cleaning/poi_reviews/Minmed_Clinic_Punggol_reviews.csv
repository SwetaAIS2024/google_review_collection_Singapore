Arsyad Ishak,5,"I had a great experience at this clinic. The service was fast, efficient, and the staff were clearly knowledgeable. Everything was well-organized, and I didn’t have to wait long. Special thanks to Janelle, the clinic assistant, who was incredibly helpful and made the whole process smooth and stress-free. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for quality medical care with excellent support staff.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109870825405513572352/reviews

Arvee de Guzman,5,"I’ve been seeing Dr. Ow for years, and his competence and attention to detail are truly unmatched. He takes the time to get things right, which gives me a lot of confidence in my care. Janelle at the front desk is also fantastic—always welcoming and incredibly accommodating, which makes every visit smoother.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112713544307285744365/reviews
Juni M E,3,"Minmed app is easy to use for booking of appointment, etc. Service and care given by the doctor who attended to me was excellent. He explained every step and made me comfortable as I am always anxious when comes to needles. I had both health screening and flu vaccination.
However, the service by the counter staff (or receptionists, perhaps?) was unfortunately poor. Took some time for just one (of the four) of them to answer my query as all seemed to be engrossed with own work. I understand that they might have been busy but the reply was rude and crude.
I was called back to return to the clinic as my waist-hip measurement was not taken when I was there earlier in the day. When I arrived, my measurements were taken right at the reception desk, in front of all the waiting patients. Hope the service by the counter staff could be improved. Mutual respect poster is plastered behind the counter and I am sure mutual respect works both ways.
When I opened my report on the app, my height was entered wrongly! Makes me wonder if the whole report is even accurate.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103127174313084496053/reviews
Alvin Cheng,2,25 queue number in-front of me today. Waited 2 hours for 20 queue numbers ahead. Another 1 hour 30 minutes for 5 queue numbers ahead. Total of 3 hours spent just to see a doctor. Do not come here if you have any urgent cases. No point queuing if everyone keeps jumping ahead in line. Just tell the staff you have urgent cases and get bypassed easily.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114743273380526907355/reviews
