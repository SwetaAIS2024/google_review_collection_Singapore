I wasn’t convinced, so I went to another clinic the same day for proper HPV testing. A week later, the results came back — no HPV at all. Just a heads-up for anyone needing gynecological care: avoid this place, it’s really not professional.",

He has this calm demeanour that I find comfort in and at times, his responses catch us by surprise (in a humorous way we thought). Delivery was smooth and stitches were done professionally. Charges were reasonable, and staff are very friendly. Highly recommend Dr. Woo and his team and I would definitely go back should I consider for a second child.",
