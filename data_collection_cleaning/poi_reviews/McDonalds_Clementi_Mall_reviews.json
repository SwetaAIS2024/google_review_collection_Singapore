The milo‚Ä¶ was very bad. Worse than I do it myself at home. Is so diluted and could not determine was it because the powder did not dissolve well? Somehow the pancakes is bland too.",

      "text": "Waited 55 minutes for a takeaway order before it was prepared and served. They must have made a mistake or had some error in the system. I had to ask twice, and when the second staff member actually checked properly, they claimed the number had already been called. It hadn't. I was right at the pickup counter the entire time. There was no unclaimed food that could have been mine - only one unclaimed bag in the mobile order section with a different order number. There's clearly some issue with the workflow and process at the outlet. Staff were polite, but I'm a little disappointed they didn't acknowledge any issue and stuck to the \"number was called\" line even when giving me my very late meal.",

She‚Äôs either busy cleaning the tables, mopping floors & even go extra mile to find seats for customers. Always smiling & even ask if everything is ok. Her service is exceptional!!!üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª Hope her hardwork did not go unnoticed by the management of this clementi mall branch.",
