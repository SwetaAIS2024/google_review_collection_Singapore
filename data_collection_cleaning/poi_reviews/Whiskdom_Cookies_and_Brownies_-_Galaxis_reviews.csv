Ewe Keat Huan,5,"Dropped by Whiskdom Galaxy at Fusionopolis and tried their cookie, brownie, and a bagel‚Äîand wow, the portions do not hold back.

The bagel was massive and super satisfying‚Äîcrusty on the outside, soft inside, and packed with delicious filling. Easily a meal on its own. Their cookie and brownie were rich, indulgent, and everything you'd expect from Whiskdom‚Äôs famous bakes.

Only downside? The shop had a bit of a burnt food smell lingering inside‚Äîmaybe from recent baking, but it did take away slightly from the otherwise cozy experience.

Rating: 4/5 ‚Äî fantastic bakes and hearty portions; just hope the ventilation improves a bit.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103626082513610890905/reviews
Jennifer,4,"We came here because sis wanted to try their bagels.

We had:
üêÑ ALOHA PULLED BEEF ($18)
Pulled beef, grilled pineapple, cabbage. barbecue sauce

üêì BREAKFAST SAMMY ($14)
Chicken spam, hashbrown, sunny side up. chicken floss, sweet mayo

Both came with tater tots. They were out of other bagels except for original. Simple filling meal.

Other than bagels, they also serve rice bowls and an array of drinks.

üççThe Crown ($8)- pineapple and Americano
üíú Taro Latte ($7.50)- it‚Äôs the syrup kind

I do agree about the ventilation issue that there‚Äôs this stale air but we were not super bothered about it. The staff was very nice and friendly.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110520605084204408119/reviews
Wong Jiayi,1,"Bad ventilation-very strong oil smell upon entering‚Ä¶ should have taken it as a cue to not eat here but everywhere else was crowded and I was in a rush.

Food was a let down. My bagel (shrooms melt) was 1. Cold in the middle, 2. Cheese was not melted. The only thing that was ok was the tater tots

The coffee options? My $7 oat white came looking as per my picture. Couldn‚Äôt be bothered asking for a change as I was so appalled that the barista thought this was acceptable to serve to a customer. Easily the worst presented coffee I‚Äôve had in Singapore.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104944194793926436900/reviews
G Wang,3,"Got a bagel for brunch. For takeaway I was charged the same price listed on the menu. Staff made it to order behind the counter, like the beef wasn't pre-prepared, they took fresh raw beef and cooked it in a pan- nice but probably a long wait during peak hours. My request for no onions was entertained. The bagel is soft and brioche-like. The taste was alright but nothing amazing.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112996815902090344930/reviews
Kai Ling,5,Really cute bunny mascot. Pretty purple taro latte so pleasing to the eyes. Fulfilling meal stuffed with well marinated meat.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100635259993109346258/reviews
