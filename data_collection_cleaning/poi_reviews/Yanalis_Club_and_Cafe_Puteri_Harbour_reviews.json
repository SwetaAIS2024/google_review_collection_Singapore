      "text": "IF YOU ARE HUNGRY DONT COME! The first food we ordered came after 56mins. The next dishes came after 1hr + waiting. Food is cold. Fish is uncooked. Nasi goreng gila is tasty but can taste bits of the salt once in every 2-3 feed.Yuck. Ayam gunting they sprinkle chilli flakes without asking first. Crispy chicken burgerâ€™s fries is so pale and taste weird. Looks like they put it in the air fryer instead of frying it in the actual oil. Chicken satay is good but only get it after all of the other meal is at the very last bite. OVERPRICE, LONG WAITING, NOISY. Dont get the hype. Very very not worth the time and money",
