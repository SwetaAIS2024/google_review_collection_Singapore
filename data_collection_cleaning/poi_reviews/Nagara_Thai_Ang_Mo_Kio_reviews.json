Everything was well-cooked and nicely presented.\n\nThe price was very affordable for the quality and portion sizes. The service was quick.\n\nHighly recommend this place! Will definitely come again.",

We enjoyed the Pineapple Fried Rice, Stir Fried Vegetable, Steamed Seabass, Green Curry Prawn and Red Ruby dessert. Also the special dish Braised Pork Knuckle. We chose mainly the non-spicy dishes which are kids-friendly.",

The male cashier’s attitude was shockingly poor—he even went out of his way to give me 18 dimes as change.\n\nFrom the start, we waited nearly an hour, we were served just two dishes: a mango salad and an omelet with only three shrimp. Then tom yum soup had barely any ingredients, and when I brought it up, his response was dismissive: “I gave it to you for free. If you’re unhappy, that’s not my problem.”\n\nSuch blatant disregard for customers speaks volumes!",
