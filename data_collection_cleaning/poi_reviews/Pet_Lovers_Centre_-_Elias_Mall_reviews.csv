Zon,5,"Very friendly staff. Greeted me and asked if I needed help upon entering. A pity that I didn't manage to get her name.

Quite a small outlet, but I feel that it provides adequate variety in the neighborhood Elias mall",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102533773384381773636/reviews
Khairil Anuar,1,Needed an urgent buy but store closed earlier than expected. Canâ€™t talk it out as I already knew what to buy. Unlucky of me. Should have written or adjust the operating time to 2150hrs instead. Wasted my time and effort for rushing down.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113097586378929671712/reviews
ADELINE ZARINA,1,"There is a female staff there named Liang, who is unprofessional in handling customers needs. She's loud n extremely rude.

Isabella Heng,1,"Spent $137 on Saturday 9th January 2021 on several items. They gave 2 packs of Fish 4 Dogs samples for my babies to try. Fed them at 7pm on the same night, my youngest boy started vomiting for more than 7 times and my elder boy started vomiting at 2am for more than 3 times. Both boys had diarrhea. Sent a complain to Pet Lovers Centre via whatsapp and facebook, the only response they gave was sorry. After what my boys went through its just one sorry? I'm seriously disappointed!!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101178990492930845632/reviews
