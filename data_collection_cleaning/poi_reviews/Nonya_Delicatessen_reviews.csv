Jonathan Loh,5,Had the nasi lemak. Chicken cutlet felt homemade and not ya run of the mill crappy frozen ones w the thick chicken skin. Achar which I rarely eat is similarly just right w slight twang and sweetness. Good portions too. Canâ€™t complain really. A treasure at Bukit Timah plaza.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116123576591476629932/reviews
Rick Koh,4,It has a while since I had a meal at Nonya Delicatessen. Same crews running the place. We had their mee Siam and their Nasi Kunyit. I remember it tastes a lot better than it is now. The prawn is missing and the price has gone up north. Still a good bowl of Mee Siam. The Nasi Kunyit is still good with the Curry Chicken thigh. Very good curry umami.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106510842319180067826/reviews
Bluerie Lin,5,First time trying it as it was closed the last time I was in that area. The meat was very soft and piping hot. The rice and the chilli on the egg were nice too. Like their coffee too!

AC Chan,5,"This small and cosy place which specialises in Peranakan food is very popular with the lunch crowd and has been around at Bukit Timah Plaza since I first visited in the late Eighties. Overall, the food quality and taste is pretty much homely and above average.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
