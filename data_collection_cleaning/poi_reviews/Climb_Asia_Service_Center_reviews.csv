cse1217,4,"Climb Asia has a physical store called Crank Factory that's up on the 2nd level of Focus One Building.

Initially when I entered, I thought I went to the wrong place as it looks much small compared to the photos shown on Google map.

After checking with the people who worked in other stores at Focus one, I confirmed that it's the correct place.

You have to enter into the office area to let them know you are looking to try their climbing shoes and other equipments.

They have a very friendly staff to help you get the size of the shoes and harness you want. He also has knowledge of whether the shoe is considered too big for you or not.

Do give a call to them before going down to check if they have your shoe size. Just nice when I visit them, they ran out of my shoe size.

Overall, I had a pleasant experience with them.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116495992746370870847/reviews

soleeeily lal2,3,"This place (specifically address at 53 Ubi Ave 1), is no longer a shop for customer. It is a warehouse in the industrial park and accordingly to staff.

Attention to everyone who intends to go here for climbing gear shopping - please do not go to this address.

Attention to the business owner, kindly update your google address to avoid customers who make the trip all the way there (including finding where is the lift lobby) only to realize there is nothing there at the address (#03-17).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102312009494838674477/reviews
Shaun Q,5,"Went there to buy harness and shoes. Took the entire allocated time to choose my climbing shoes, made a lot of requests and asked a lot of questions, yet the staffs there were so patient with me and eventually
helped find the perfect pair of shoes for me. Had a really great time there, the staffs were super friendly and amazingly nice. 100% would shop there again!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115706433316651049732/reviews
