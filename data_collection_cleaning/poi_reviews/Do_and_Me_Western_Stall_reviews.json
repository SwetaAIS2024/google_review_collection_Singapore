The dish came with sides like fries, baked beans, coleslaw and a small bread. The taste was average â€” nothing particularly impressive, but decent for a quick meal.",

      "text": "food served really fast despite non stop order. Chicken cutlet is soft tender and juicy. Fries are crispy and nice too. The bun are deep fried and good.\nPrice not really cheap as its 8 dollars for a Chicken cutlet at a coffee shop.\nBut I would rate it as worth it though.. the food feels traditional enough unlike many western food with modern name and cooked my Malaysian workers instead of the owner themselves. This simple food are cooked with passion and despite the price, its good food and will enjoy eating.",

The downside was that the Coleslaw was quite bland.\n\nHappiness plate (3pcs) was delicious.\n\nWorth going!",

There are queue when we arrived, quickly secure a table and head to order.\n\nWe have ordered the fried spring chicken and cutlet. The portion is really huge, we barely finished both plates. The fried spring chicken is huge and crispy, serve along with fries, coleslaw and fried bread while the chicken cutlet is crispy outside, soft inside with same sides. They are quite valued for money!\n\nThough we can't finish the spring chicken in the end, we left the place happily and looking forward to the next visit.",
