      "text": "I love five guys with my whole heart. I crave it every time I think about eating a burger. The only thing stopping me from getting it everytime I'm in proximity of a five guys outlet is the price point. Insane price for a fast food joint but again, I go back because I am simply a slave to the system, a mere submissive to the sound of free toppings and crispy fries with refillable drinks. I have to physically limit myself from thinking about this too often because my husband loves me so if I even mention wanting to get this, he will persuade me to come back to five guys and I love him so it takes little for him to persuade me. However I know that if we succumb to this too often, we will soon not be able to afford our house. That is how much I think about eating at five guys. Every bite of burger that I take, I have to physically retaliate and react to the wonder of this food. The crispy bacon in this burger is love like no other. The utter lack of care for the size of the fries cup, overfilling it to the point of no return in the brown paper bag, is the reason I love you guys. If I were richer by even a hundred dollars, I would get a milkshake every time I come here but alas, I survive with the refillable drinks and that will sate me for now. Please, do not open an outlet in the east or it will be the end for me.",

It is very nice that you can choose what to add to your burger - what sauce, what spices, what vegetables. I was pleased with the potatoes, they are not the usual fries, but cut into straws and fried potatoes with skin, very tasty.\nI recommend it for friendly meetings.",

I ordered 7 portions big french fried for 16 paxes but at the end we cannot finish.\nRecommend for you: 4 French fries are enough for 16 paxes.\nBurger price in average 18-20$, pricey however in return the burger is big and beef is moisture.",
