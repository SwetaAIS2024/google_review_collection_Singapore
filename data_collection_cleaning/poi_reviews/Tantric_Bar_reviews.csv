John Sherwood,1,"This used to be such a good bar. Not now!! And it used to occupy three units, now only one. The bar person was rude and unhelpful. Free WiFi? I couldn’t understand what she said! Generally unfriendly service. Avoid. Go elsewhere. Dorothy’s is much better!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115202454152514193429/reviews
Mark Smith,4,We like to support the local lgbti community and tantric is an institution in Singapore. We visited on Easter Saturday and just stay3d downstairs. It was a bit quiet.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113697226620175749511/reviews
Charmaine Tan,1,We were a group of ladies that dropped by for some drinks. Ordered a jug of cocktail but the amount of alcohol was not even noticeable. It just tasted like fruit punch. Service was ok but another patron was rudely complaining what we girls were doing in a gay bar. Totally uncalled for. Would not recommend anyone to come here for drinks.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107302280394206664099/reviews
John a,5,"Fun, friendly, welcoming ... Like a big hug with great music and tasty drinks. One of the classic gay bars in town with all the attributes that keep it popular year after year. The drink menu has a wide variety of cocktails - from sweet and fun to serious mixes - to numerous varieties of shots. Handsome hard-working staff take time to be friendly with everyone, which is the one reason Tantric remains a local institution. Opens at 5 pm which is the right time for a quiet drink, come after 8 pm to mingle and meet. Reservations suggested for anytime after 7 pm.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115322239165769116221/reviews
DreamFoodie,4,"Good ambience, great place to hangout if you wanna have some fun bar hopping!

Its is good for any kinda people to visit here staff is amazing and people around are always at their best behaviour which is pretty much everyone in Singapore!!

So if I am in town next a definite visit again.. Dream foodie rates this 4 on 5 just coz the place gets a little too congested on weekends but super cool stuff..",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117479806255156176196/reviews
