JL,5,A peaceful Christmas Eve dinner at the restaurant with family. We enjoyed the food such as the herbal monkeyhead mushroom and salad sushi. Personally I like the almond sauce noodle which is very appetising 🍜. Give it a try.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112551753211824917319/reviews
Zhihan Lee,5,"Though more on the pricey end, Yes Natural's dishes do taste well and healthy. Good branding :) we ordered the sweet sour pork thingy, a soup, spinach vegetable dish and the tofu with special sauce. The other plus coming here is getting some nice breads and vegetarian grocery next door too 😁 super convenient.

Grace Ling,5,It has been so long since my last visit because I don't stay near here. The Almond Sauce Noodles still taste delicious like before. The staffs were friendly too. It's highly recommended for both vegan and  vegetarian lunch and dinner options. Do pop by their bakery and shop which is just next door!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105123614248393583856/reviews
Chua Bernard,4,"Have been wanting to taste the food of this 16 year old (As claimed by their service staff) vegetarian restaurant for years due to friends’ recommendations, but didnt get the chance to do so till now.

Wow by their Savory Marmite Caps (Well fried Abalone Mushrooms of chewy texture and crispy thin outer crust, well coated with a rich mixture of Marmite and soy sauce) and their Crispy Veggie Crush (Good bite texture of Soybean “Pork” coupled with spicy savory sauce).

Wanted to order their Veggie Chicken Rice (Roasted) but they only serve this dish only on selected days (Monday, Wednesday & Friday, except Public Holidays, 1st and 15th of each lunar month). Thus we replace it with their Beansprout Chicken Medley that consisted of the same roasted “Chicken” pieces as their Veggie Chicken Rice.

Well, those “Chicken” pieces were indeed fragrant and had good bite texture, but overall its average to me, like their Noodles Nirvana (Good noodle texture but flavour could do a little bit more salt).

Overall, service staffs were friendly and helpful, but could be better if they were more attentive. Seating arrangements could also be better managed, due to limited seating capacity to minimize 1 pax to a 4 paxs table issue.

Anyway, we will return again to try out their other dishes 👍🏻",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116763827953354833238/reviews
