Peter Chua,4,"Taan Asian Grill Bar is a lively and inviting eatery in Singapore, offering a unique fusion of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and local cuisines. Their menu features an impressive array of over 50 charcoal-grilled skewers, complemented by a fun selection of frozen beers. The ambiance is cozy, and the staff are attentive and friendly. A quirky touch: if you order beer in larger quantities, you'll be given mahjong chips to use for redeeming your drinks — a playful twist that adds to the experience.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117320083836989480538/reviews
Oli Long,5,"Absolutely mind-blowing BBQ! The smoky aroma hits you the second you walk in, and every bite is pure heaven. The meat is perfectly tender, juicy, and packed with flavor. Amazing, especially the 🌟Mongolian Lamb Rack🌟. This place isn’t just a meal, it’s an experience. If you’re a BBQ LOVER, do yourself a favor and come here ASAP. Trust me, you’ll be dreaming about it for days!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106855136264535299947/reviews
Kathryn Riley,5,"Honestly amazing! We had the spicy dry pot prawn and I think it’s my fave meal in Singapore, if not ever! So flavoursome and the place is more of a bar so very relaxed - just what we like. Returned during our trip as nothing else came close. We had the skewers this time which were nice but nothing special so the stir fry menu is the way to go!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114165680718570921745/reviews
