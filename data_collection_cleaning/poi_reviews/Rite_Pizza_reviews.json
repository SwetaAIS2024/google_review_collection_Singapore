      "text": "Ordered pizzas and garlic bread for dinner last week. The super spicy chicken pizza was super salty. Instead of spicy, the whole pizza tasted like someone poured a bottle of salt into the pizza rather. Tried another slice and it was the same saltiness. Had to throw the rest of the pizza away as it was way too salty. Very disappointing experience as we've been ordering from Rite Pizza for years and been recommending to our family and frens :(",
