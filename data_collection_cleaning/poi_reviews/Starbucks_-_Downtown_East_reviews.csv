Shenthil Ranie,4,"It’s Xmas season and the place has nice merchandise. The salted caramel chocolate cake was divine. We ordered the strawberry cake but it started to ‘melt’ and become soggy. When we raised it, the crew offered us another piece of the same cake. We were uncomfortable as the mannerism from one of the Malay guys was abrupt and he looked upset too. We did not want the same strawberry cake to prevent risk of eating another soggy cake. They then exchanged it for a salted caramel cake. Overall, I’ve always had a good experience at Starbucks here but the attitude of this staff was a turn off as he was not mindful",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109754761691774661226/reviews

Michael Fernandez,5,"Starbucks at Downtown East is different from other outlets because of Marlon who stands out when it comes to Customer Service. He is always smiling, very enthusiastic and passionate about what he does and would even bring my drink to me if i am busy with other matters. It indeed is a pleasant experience at Starbucks Downtown East when Marlon is on duty. Thank you for making my experience there a great one !",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108635706362247872035/reviews
Jonathan Goh,5,"Fantastic outlet.
Spacious and clean.

Had the tiramisu cake and an order of oat milk latte grande size. Was able to enjoy the cake and drink in peace on a Sunday afternoon which is rather rare for Starbucks.

The vibe and ambience is typical Starbucks which is great. Would return.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110102844324205858222/reviews
