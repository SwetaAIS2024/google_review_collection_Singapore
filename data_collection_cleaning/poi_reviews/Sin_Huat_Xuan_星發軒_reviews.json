      "text": "Food was great! Interesting local twist to the dishes too. The Tom yum prawn pasta had a great creamy broth that wasn't too spicy & the prawns were fresh & succulent. Pork chop fried rice was great as well. Crispy fried pork cutlet & the fried rice was really fragrant. Also love their ha chiong gai (prawn paste fried chicken) with mala sauce. Gives the traditional dish a unique spicy kicküëçüèº They don't charge GST or service charge so prices are really reasonable. The only glaring thing lacking is service. I think they're kinda jaded of humans & try to have 0 interaction. When forced to interact, they talk like a robot with no warmth or welcome. I guess they've been worn out by entitled & demanding customers in the past so they put no effort now. But a lil' effort & a lil' smile could go a long way & I hope they find the light within themselves to do just that somedayüôèüèº",

Definitely recommend üëçüèª",

Pasta was done well, not too soggy with a nice bite.\n\nHave indoor and outdoor options with paynow, paylah and cash payment modes. Accessible area as well.\n\nOverall, recommended place and will go back again to try other food.",

Steak was bland and the saving grace was the steak sauce, which is the best I have came across. Fries were above average. Overall, some hits and some misses.",
