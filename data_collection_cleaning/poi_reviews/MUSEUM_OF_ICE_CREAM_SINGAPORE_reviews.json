Overhyped tourist attraction with nothing for an adult tourist. Definitely not worth for the money paid to visit this tourist attraction.",

      "text": "An obviously over hyped spot with a pricey entrance ticket they won’t accept cash. Remember if you are going as a group you can’t mix premium and standard tickets in the same bookings, they will ask to upgrade the standard to premium in spot. Not well connected with the metro and you got to relay on taxis. The themed rooms were picturesque whereas the taste of the ice cream was nothing special. Even though it is unlimited ice cream you won’t be in position to eat much due to the design of the menu and the place. The sprinkler pit was enjoyable but if you miss your belongings the employees will not definitely not help you as they have already mentioned. Be care with your mobiles, wallets and any other valuables while entering the pit. It’s a uni directional museum where one can’t re enter the past rooms.",
