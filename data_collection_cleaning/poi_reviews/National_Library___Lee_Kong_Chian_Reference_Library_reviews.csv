Graham Rodda,5,A delightful cultural institution set in an impressive building including a gallery on level 10. When we visited there was a great level 10 show showcasing four artists who visited Indonesia in the 50's. The show was excellently curated and included a wonderful collection of photos from the library archives. The library cafe is on level 3 and has refreshments and a fabulous view. Staff friendly and helpful. For a great view get the lift to the top level.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108084311827510380964/reviews
CS* Chia,4,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting this library, and I must say, it was a delightful experience!

Children's Corner: The highlight for me was the beautifully decorated children's corner, which features an enchanting underwater and submarine theme. It's not just visually stunning; it creates an imaginative space that encourages young readers to dive into their favorite books.

Adults and Youth Areas: The library also boasts spacious areas for adults and youth, with plenty of comfortable seating. Whether you're looking to study, read, or simply relax, there's a perfect spot for everyone.

Outdoor Space: On the fifth level, there's an outdoor area that provides a refreshing escape to catch some fresh air. It's a great place to take a break and let your eyes rest while enjoying the view.

Overall, my visit was incredibly pleasant, and I highly recommend this library to anyone looking for a welcoming and inspiring environment. It’s definitely worth a visit!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108623615709050081392/reviews
Savan,5,"This is my first time borrowing books from the National Library Building since it’s quite far from where I live.

However, my teacher mentioned that this library has a wider selection of reference books.

The environment here is much more spacious, beautiful, and cleaner than district libraries. There’s a great sense of openness, and the book collection is more extensive. Some floors even have only two or three visitors, quietly reading or listening to music.

Highly recommended for anyone who wants to experience a great reading atmosphere!

The only thing to criticize is that some parents allow their children to sleep on the seats. It feels a bit strange.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115757903290306503916/reviews

Rameya Shanmugavelayutham,4,"Calm, vast library with many nice work spaces.

Many floors.Escalators and elevators make it accessible for people with mobility difficulties.

Modern building that is a bit bitter sweet for locals due to the tearing down of an older historic building.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106076369470796486232/reviews
