Karis O.,5,"I've been to Futurez a couple of times, and we (friends and I) likes to have Heineken towers, and some times some soju from there (although they don't have all the flavours, but me and friends don't really mind when we really wanna cure our soju thirst from time to time).

The people from the bar are always very friendly, and they do have some pretty good singers from there as well. They have a pool table and ktv to offer if you like some entertainment!

A good place to chill and sing if you like, good place for gathering with friends!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115979419066817446745/reviews
Eliza Lim,1,DO NOT COME FUTREZ BAR UNLESS U WANT TO HABE BROKEN GLASS IN YOUR THROAT. We have been regulars and feedback abt the broken glass and jug many times . And many times we have drank the broken chips of glass in the beer. The boss Sarah replied saying it doesn’t kill us n simply pour the beer from ‘already broken chipped jug’ into another beer glass to serve us.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105150058237359449868/reviews
Heah Lewis,1,"Price list states $75 per tower and also confirmed the price with waitress before ordering. End up, we were charged more. While clarifying on the bill, they went ahead and swipe the card. I’m told that they said the price wrongly and I should man up since it’s only a small amount. Ok, u earned a few bucks more, lost a few customers and earned yourself a bad review.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114102217647783352865/reviews
Daniel Lee,1,Karaoke pub where the manager hogs the microphone and shows no mercy to our senses. A place where paying customers are made to feel unwanted. Definitely a challenge as an entertainment option.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106989770567743301478/reviews
