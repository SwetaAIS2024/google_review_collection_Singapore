Angeline Voon,5,"Entering TC Family Clinic is one of my best decision. I was feeling upset over the past experience of other gynae, Dr Chan gave me assurance and she takes care of other aspects of my health. She does a thorough check, moving one step at a time while checking on my mental health constantly.

So far, i had visited twice, i am still following up on my health. Dr Chan offers great, realistic advices and goals to improve my health.

Not forgetting her great team. her staff both are caring, friendly and polite.

Overall a great experience and i will highly recommend for health management.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111669418509006576957/reviews
Phyllis Zheng,5,"This is my 1st visit today. I walked in to the clinic this morn without calling for appointment; I thought they allow walk in, but was told by the clinic nurses that they only serve patients with appointments. However, nurse Jennie was really kind to allow me to wait to see Dr, as she saw I was in really bad condition and she knew I purposely visited them after reading all the good reviews! She even served me warm water which I really appreciate! Dr Tammy is also really kind and very motherly-like. I hope to recover soon, and I really like to thank Jennie for your kind gesture üíñ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102565632590947061481/reviews

CG Low,5,"TC Family clinic --- and Dr Chan is one of the best GPs I have ever encountered. The staff works like a swiss clock in terms of procedures.
Dr Chan has got such a great approach toward an elderly patient like myself -- with respect, explains things patiently and in simpler terms I can understand.
Over the years, I have recommended her to many of my friends.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105982669482002041684/reviews
