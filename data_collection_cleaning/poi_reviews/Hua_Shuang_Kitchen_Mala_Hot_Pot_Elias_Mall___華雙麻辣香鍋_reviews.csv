chs97,1,"used to be good, but compared to other Hua Shuang stores, this has become bad.
chicken v flat, its like they always don’t add some powder seasoning (numb and spicy) at the end of frying.
Shredded potato also not even sour.
Boss, please, if you are seeing this, fire the chef.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115657860771062341468/reviews

Sean Tan,1,"Food wise, over priced. China lady at the counter is just deluded and rude. To be fair, cooking wise, when I’m actually able to order ah, is okay. Not the best. But pasir ris la. Avoid all this hassle. Really not worth it. Rude staff and sub par food dependent on mood. Not worth it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109442083646329107175/reviews
Jun Kai Toh,1,"Decently priced based on recommended portions, inclusive of more premium meats.
Xiao La is weaker than average so I would go for Zhong La next time. Missing the numbness though.

Update:
Chinese lady grumbled a lot when I asked for receipt. Turns out she keyed in prices randomly (?), not by weight. Receipt used to show price breakdown based on weight and type of ingredient.
That being said, Oyster sauce was pretty good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107198429972623127094/reviews
