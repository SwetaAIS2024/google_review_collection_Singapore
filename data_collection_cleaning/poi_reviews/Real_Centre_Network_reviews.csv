tommy yang,5,"I have attended the RES course with RCN by Kent Soo. Kent is an outstanding instructor. He is sharp, detailed, and explains complex RES concepts in a way thatâ€™s easy to understand. Even after the course ended, he remained approachable and responded quickly to my questions. His dedication and helpful nature make him a truly great teacher. I highly recommend anyone considering the RES course to learn from Kent!

Joan Lee,5,"Hurray!!! I couldn't hold my excitement for one time passed.

First of all, I would like to thank Real Centre Network TAMPINES for providing such a confident RES course. I am also thankful that Mr. Kent Soo is so generous in his presentation styles. The willingness to help students make me feel touching. He is a very experienced lecturer and RES. Through his experience in the Real Estate industry, he can tell us more practical knowledge and expertise. Hopefully, RCN TAMPINES can retain such a good lecturer to teach more future RES.

One more person to thanks is Serene. Serene can manage all kinds of problems I face before and after courses as a dedicated and meticulous individual. Serene is friendly and helpful.

Thank you RCN TAMPINES again!!! :)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105135297351519770617/reviews

Kent is the coolest and most inspiring mentor ever. Highly recommend to take in person classes with Kent for the full cinematic experience ðŸ˜œ His unique mindmapping system and case study application enable so many in my cohort to pass Paper 2! Special thanks to admins Serene and Daphne for the kind help with make up classes and planning the programme schedule :)

The exam is tricky but Iâ€™m sure everyone can do it :) Letâ€™s go and see you in the industry!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118088434530971558686/reviews
