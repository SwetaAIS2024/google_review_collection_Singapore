P Lim,5,"I’ve probably dined here about four times by now. There’s always a wide selection of both cooked and raw food - not to mention that desserts, condiments, and drinks are all included in the buffet price.

The service is great, and dining here has always been an enjoyable experience.

I’d definitely come more often if it weren’t located in such a busy downtown area. LOL.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101263776907216625108/reviews
Vivian Foo,4,"There was a wide selection of both cooked and raw food. We ordered the collagen soup and chicken ginseng soup, both were flavourful, with the collagen soup being especially delicious. The meats, including pork collar, pork liver, pork belly, and sliced chicken, were fresh and of good quality. There were beef slices too but we did not try them. There was also a generous variety of vegetables to choose from, such as kai lan, spinach, cabbage, and mushrooms.
For drinks, there were three options: sour plum, blackcurrant, and fruit punch.
We enjoyed the sour plum drink the most.
We ordered the yam paste and peach gum ching teng for dessert. The yam paste was average, go for the peach gum dessert.
Among the cooked dishes, we particularly enjoyed the fried chicken wings, fried nian gao and the volcano spicy pork. A DIY sauce station added a nice personal touch to the meal.
The staff were attentive and efficient, regularly topping up the soup and clearing plates promptly. Overall, it was a great dining experience, and we’ll definitely be back for more!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100911167835907085056/reviews

Will,3,"Utility is quite low. The liver is not fresh, the condiments all very bland. Even the ginseng herbal soup is bland.

The veg, like spinach is old and fibrous.

Need not fully enjoy the 90mins.

Left within an hour.

Suggestion: improve ur condiments, soup base. And do not keep on promoting like and share. Back then I ate more than 20 times at centerpoint, intro others to eat there. If food is fresh and nice, there will be pple.

Service is good.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118119525043286062929/reviews
