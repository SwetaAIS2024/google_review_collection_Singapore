Once I placed order, I then told her no syrup when I see that she added syrup to soya milk. She smile smile tell me must tell her no syrup while pouring back /out the syrup. I smile smile replied that she never asked. So she still maintain her smile and say this must say in advance. But for beancurd she did take the initiative to ask me if I wanted syrup.  I am the person in maroon red in case they want to know who left this review (and there's also cctv camera) . Adding pictures of what I had ordered.",

But the auntie said $2.30, cny surcharge. There is no signs / written notice of the surcharge. Furthermore, the auntie used the ice from the ice cooler which have prep cups filled with soy bean milk.\nI will not visit again!",
