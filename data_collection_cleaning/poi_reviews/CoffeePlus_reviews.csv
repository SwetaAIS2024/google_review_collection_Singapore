Jeena Hey,5,"After lunch, we went for coffee and ordered white coffee. While the barista was making our coffee, we noticed the vanilla ice cream, which looked amazing—full of vanilla beans (too bad there’s no photo!). Excited, we asked for a taste, but it turned out to be quite disappointing. It was just sweet without any vanilla bean flavor.

Anyway, the white coffee was good—strong and not too milky. I liked it. Since I'm here for the coffee, I'm still giving it 5 stars.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113552326796326120362/reviews
Gopi Bala,3,"This was my first visit to this little cafe.

I ordered a small scoop of chocolate chip crunch, and to my surprise this small scoop cost $7.50.

While the ice cream was nice, the ambiance and pricing did not provide value for money.

The tables outside were also not cleared of the ice cream and coffee cups making it look messy. It was not like the staff in the cafe was busy at all.

At a price point of $7.50, the scoop should have been bigger.

Will I patronise this place again? Probably not!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114775727475904526433/reviews

celinemy,5,"Staffs are friendly enough to customize a white cold brew for us, impressed by the strong chocolate flavor, would be better to serve with heavier milk as well.
No indoor seat but the constant breeze at the outdoor seats is great!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113590329818045001653/reviews
