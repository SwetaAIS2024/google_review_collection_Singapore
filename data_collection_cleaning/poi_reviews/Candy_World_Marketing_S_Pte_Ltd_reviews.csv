Ruby Tok,1,If got ZERO star rating I'll gladly give them ZERO star. Staff attitude is super bad. Walked in to buy candies for gifts but was shoo-ed away by them saying they don't sell things in the morning. Asked me to go back at 1pm to buy. Never going back again!,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108559158750120161141/reviews
