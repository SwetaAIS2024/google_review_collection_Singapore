      "text": "Cathay has undergone a revamp and is now looking gorgeous! It has a beautiful massive screen, and the mall’s interior is full of green spaces and high ceilings.\n\nAlthough it’s just a ‘soft launch’ for now, there are already several F&B outlets open like Tsui Wah, Starbucks, Kebuke, Fore coffee and Saizeriya, with Saboten, Wingstop, Yakiniku, yakun and a basement food court etc upcoming. Unfortunately there is no more cinema, but before the renovation there were already very few cinema patrons, so that’s to be expected.\n\nExcited for what’s to come!",

A pity that the acoustics are very echo-ey, which makes it hard to hear the song, or have a conversation in Starbucks",

Both the floors has huge empty space but no seats, such a waste of space, bad planning, all they had was 2 standing tables. I couldn't check out the shops because most are closed. Coming from real estate background this place is not well plan, no good flow/energy. In the cinema, the seats are comfortable but sadly there were only 3 pax watching. Lots can be done for improvement.",
