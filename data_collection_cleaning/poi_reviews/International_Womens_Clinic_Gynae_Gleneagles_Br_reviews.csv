Aaron Jones,5,We used Dr Ang for our first born this December. As British expats in Singapore the system here is very new to us. Dr Ang and her staff at the clinic were great throughout. Her calm approach worked well for us as we didn’t feel pushed into any decisions that we didn’t want. My wife gave birth naturally to our baby boy. Thank you Dr Ang!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113470234792374363302/reviews
Cheryl Tan,5,"Dr Ang took care of me for 3 of my pregnancies. I have 2 healthy boys who have grown up and a recent 3rd pregnancy which unfortunately was unhealthy and I had to medically terminate in my second trimester. As all women who went through pregnancy would know, the pregnancy journey is a very personal one and I found her to be very supportive, caring and empathetic through it all. She even stepped in and escalated my feedback when I had a poor experience with the hospital and issues with my insurance claim — this is beyond her duties as a Doctor and goes to show she truly cared for her patient to go the extra mile. Thank you Dr Ang and team for taking care of me!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109181097105122489399/reviews
Tony Wen,5,"very caring and patient gynae in town. fees very reasonable. We came to know doctor Ang 10 years ago through a friend, and here we are after 3 kids(9, 6, 3 yr old this year) smoothly delivered by her. Wife still goes back for pap smear and checks yearly. Dr Ang is one who doesn't waste time mingling too much with patients, only necessary info was exchanged.   She has been very responsible and reliable too, our third pregnancy required once for her to attend to an emergency visit at 1am, she turned up in time and made wife and baby safe. With her we always feel comforted and in good hands. Thank her from bottom of our hearts, and i hope more mums dads can come out to give fair reviews for what she and clinic deserve. For our first child we were nervous, had to rush with work schedule etc. over the years we also learnt to take it slowly. usually we would take a day off and go early, report in and go downstairs to have breakfast and coffee, arrange a lunch nearby after the checkup. just take this routine checkup as part of the whole pregnancy process.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112773000789678910348/reviews
Kelly Loh,1,"I have been with Doc Ang for years and My female condition was left undetected and eventually I had to go through a rather huge operation with a well known doctor who took care of me.

Prices are exorbitant and definitely not getting the buck with this clinic.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102673676382644105618/reviews
