Read the reviews here and have gone to him for adjustments of my wedges, and also did a driver/wedge/iron fitting with him and he was extremely patient while spending more time than he should to let me play around with different options! Extremely knowledgeable about his work and i have learnt a lot about golf clubs through him, and also gave me a few swing tips during the fitting which helped me tremendously!!",

He was very patient and provided effective feedback to help make adjustments to improve on my swing as I tried on different shafts. Ended up with the perfect shaft fit with straight drives! Highly recommended! Thanks again Jef!!",

      "text": "Must go to Jef for fitting! He is really patient and approachable.\n\nBeing generally new to the game, I went for the first fitting session and couldnt hit my irons well. Wasted 15-20 mins of his time but he was so encouraging and asked me to take more time to stabilise my swing before going back to him.\n\n1 month later, I finally went back and he fitted me with the T350s, adjusted for my height, angle and shaft stiffness. The differences were clear as I took shots alternating between my old iron and the fitted one.\n\nFast forward a few months later, I am enjoying the game so much more now and scoring better. I will always recommend my friends to get fitted, and get it done with Jef! Thanks Jef!",

His technical skill is superb and his advice invaluable.\n\nI have been going to Jef for for almost 3 years and have on multiple occasions bought clubs, fitted shafts and changed grips. His pricing is transparent, fair and definitely well worth it. I would highly recommend.",
