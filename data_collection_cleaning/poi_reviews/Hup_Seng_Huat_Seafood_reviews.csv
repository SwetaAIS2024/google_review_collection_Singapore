Belle Oh,5,"Satisfied with the consistent quantity, quality, freshness, the taste and importantly, the affordable prices of the zi char dishes. Am a returning customer.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111480789657010313446/reviews
Joshua Loh,4,$5 for Sheng mian is an absolute steal given the taste. One of the most affordable food places I have ever seen and service is extremely prompt by the owners. I heard this stall has been here for over 30 years and food used to be even cheaper at $3.50 (now $5). I love the green chilli that came along with it and the gravy did not taste like ordinary ones at other zi char places. Will be back to try out the other dishes for sure. Atmosphere is slightly hot as the fan is not at max speed and cars are always on the move nearby so it gets noisy,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115994799522225699384/reviews
