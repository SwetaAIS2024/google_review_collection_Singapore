The Pork however is too sweet maybe Its honey but then it pair with sweet sauce? ü§® I love the food here because the amount of vege they give and garlic with brocolli is Just perfect.",

Food was so-so for the price charged, 200RM for 3 dish + 3 drinks. Smoking was also an issue for us, nobody wants to inhale second-hand smoke üëç",
