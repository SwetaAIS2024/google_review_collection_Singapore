GᗩYᒪE ᒍIOᗯ ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ,5,"I'm grateful to have joined Mr. Wan's class in Sec 1 as a Normal Academic student (now called G2). His teaching methods boosted my confidence. I was offered and took E Math at O-level in Sec 2. In Sec 4, Mr. Wan encouraged me to register A Math as an O level subject even though my lessons in school was for A Math(NA). I'm thankful to Mr Wan as I have achieved distinctions in both subjects in my recent O-level results.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114224155138536257976/reviews

Serene Yeo,5,I am extremely impressed with the quality of teaching at this tuition center. Both Mr. Wan and Teacher Anna are exceptionally patient and dedicated educators.

Celine Yap,5,"Mr Wan was highly recommended by our ex neighbour. Mr Wan is very passionate in his teaching and very clear in his explaination. The material is also top notch. His style is encouraging and inspiring, focus on values and good study habit beyond academic achievement. My only regret is we should have joined earlier. My daughter did very well for her prelim and achieved AL1 in psle under his guidance. He is definitely one of the best maths teacher!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102973467673137017644/reviews
Janice G,5,"Mr. Wan’s dedication to his students is truly exemplary. Since my children joined his classes, their math skills and confidence have grown tremendously. They scored high AL1 in P5 and A1 in S1, all thanks to his outstanding coaching!

Mr. Wan has a rare talent for simplifying complex math concepts, making them accessible and manageable for students. His ability to teach higher-order thinking skills has allowed my children to tackle challenging problems with ease and confidence. Beyond academics, he instills life lessons that motivate and empower his students to reach their fullest potential.
