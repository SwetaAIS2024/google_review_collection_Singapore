      "text": "So far my experience with Singaporeans is they are very friendly and helpful people but not until I ran into this muslim lady who runs this convenience store! We needed some change for the ticket machine and she refused to give us change. Fine. So I asked what is the cheapest thing I can get because we are tourists and we are running low in cash and we didn't want to spend money unnecessarily. She blatantly refused to tell me. Fine. So I started asking her how much some of her items were. She refused to tell me! This lady is so un-Singaporean. She should be ashamed of herself. ***I urge people to stop support her shop and stop buying her overpriced merchandise that rips people off.***  Later that day I ran into a similar situation at Keat Hong LRT station and the Chinese lady was very helpful. I needed to make a phone call and she kindly lent me her mobile phone. That is what Singaporeans do when they encounter a tourist in needs. Thanks!",
