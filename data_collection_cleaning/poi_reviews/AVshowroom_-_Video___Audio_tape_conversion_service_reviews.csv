Sam Sum,2,"Gave them tapes for conversion. After one week, called the shop and It said not done yet. After two week, called the shop and the shop could not  tell me what was the status. I said I did not want o convert already and just wanted to get back the tape. They said they will call me back. After one day, never called me. I called them again and they said the tapes were converted already, but one of the tape cannot be read. Collection can be done the following Monday. They never told me which tape cannot be read. I think the administration is poor and lack of customer service.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102804617414873026725/reviews
Philip Lee,1,"Please check before you decide. It took me 5 months, persistent sms despite his uncontactable phone silence to get my old tapes back. Thankfully 2 were working but was told 3 were spoiled n not converted. You can test it out if you are not desperate, prepared to put your patience to the test, and have little expectation. Good luck.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107634922921292335390/reviews
Samuel Yeo,1,"The quality of the dvd from the mini dv tape conversion is good. However, was initially told that it'll take 2-3 days to do the conversion. Took 1.5 weeks at least with no update etc. Called numerous times to get an update, was told I'll get a call back, to no avail. Finally after 1.5 weeks, my msg was eventually replied.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113098896985895669191/reviews
