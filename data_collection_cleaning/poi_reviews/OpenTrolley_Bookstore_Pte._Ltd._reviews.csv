Stephanie,5,"ordered from them twice, very easy and fast delivery. I am so happy that they even carry Japanese mangas!!!! I purchased the Attack on Titan series from them in my second order and everything came well packed.

The reason why I even considered to use their website the first time is because I was looking for Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones. I do frequent secondhand bookstores too but alas was not able to find that book. So I thought to give OpenTrolley a try and eventually purchased the Howl's Moving Castle trilogy from them! One of the books was a backorder item but everything went smoothly, with email updates to inform me once the book stock was replenished and ready to be delivered to me.

Highly recommend to everyone looking to buy books that you aren't able to easily find in physical bookstores.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110111062430472458963/reviews
Van Lee (韶子),1,"I ordered from OpenTrolley based on the good reviews but I'm starting to wonder if these are paid/employee reviews?? Cuz it's been a week since I've placed my order and all the updates I'm getting for it is ""your order is being processed"" ""it is STILL being processed"" ""it is progressing"" and it's basically USELESS. I see people saying they've received it in a week and yet mine has yet to be dispatched?? The processing time is horrendously and unnecessarily SLOW.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116160912250902739702/reviews

Lucas Lam,4,"Ordered 3 books, and they arrived nicely shrink wrapped, without any creases and in pristine condition!

Open Trolley has a wide variety of books, and prices are definitely competitive. They’ll be my go-to bookstore moving forward!

Only gripe is that the fulfilment timeline could be a tad on the long side, taking about 2 weeks to arrive from the date ordered. Plan in advance and it will be fine!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105838269655486061343/reviews
