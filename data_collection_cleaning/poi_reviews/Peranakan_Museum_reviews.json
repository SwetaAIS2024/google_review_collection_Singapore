The whole place isn’t very big but there are actually a lot to see, especially if you interested to know about the Peranakan people and their culture. There’s also the batiks that are showcased from different eras and how the colours evolved over time.\n\nA cooling place to spend some time exploring and away from the hot sun.\n\nRight now it’s free entry to Singaporeans. May be good to go with guided tours so they bring you around and explain to you in more detail.\n\nRecommended to go to the special exhibition area too at $6 per adult. Seniors enter for free.",

It’s thoughtfully curated, with interesting exhibits that offer a glimpse into the unique Peranakan culture. I especially enjoyed the beautiful artifacts and intricate batik pieces on display. The museum layout makes it easy to explore, and there’s a good mix of history, art, and personal stories. A charming little gem if you’re curious about Singapore’s cultural heritage!",
