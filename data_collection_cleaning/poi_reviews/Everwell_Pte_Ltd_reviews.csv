Barbette Strauss,4,"I was never a fan of Cowhead brand of products until I tried out its lactose free fresh milk from Australia.  It catered to the likes of my taste buds.  However I was concerned due to the high content of sugar present in the product as 12.5 grams of sugar per serving is relatively high given my elderly age and a higher risk to be diabetic. As such, I hope that it can be reformulated further to reduce its sugar content.  For now, I would still recommend this to those who do not have an issue with its high sugar content.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116995110127835257886/reviews
