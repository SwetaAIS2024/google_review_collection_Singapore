Damcho Tshering,5,"Weekend Wanders: Jurong Central Park
Took a stroll through Jurong Central Park over the weekend — a peaceful green escape nestled just minutes away from Jurong Point and Boon Lay MRT.

Though it’s not as expansive as Jurong Lake Gardens, the park offers a refreshing and lush environment that’s perfect for unwinding after a hearty lunch or shopping spree at the mall. With its open lawns, shaded walking paths, and the gentle rustling of trees, it’s a wonderful spot to just pause and breathe.

If you’re around Jurong and need a short nature break, this park is definitely worth a visit. Sometimes, it’s the smaller green spaces that offer the biggest reset.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833702802756994837/reviews
