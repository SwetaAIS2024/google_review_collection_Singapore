Nhw,5,"I highly recommend both Leonard and Jenny if you need experienced Feng Shui masters. They offer various services like Bazi reading, home feng shui, and personal feng shui etc. Their analysis are precise, logical and easy to understand. Since consulting them, my career, house, and finances have been smooth sailing.

Both Leonard and Jenny are very responsive on WhatsApp even after the consultations. Most importantly, there is no hard selling of any products and their remedies are cost effective methods and are easily available.

I strongly recommend their services to anyone looking for reliable Feng Shui guidance.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111045298828496611425/reviews
