But the bar and restaurant is a great venue to have a bottle of wine or few pints of beer while enjoying the live band performance. Place is packed on Fridays and Saturdays though.",

The staff told me it was an old picture and I mentioned that it is false advertisement.\nThere are no cushioned seats of any comfort.  Only high back metal chairs.  Music is loud and obnoxious.  Staff is not even friendly.  Location is good for Chinatown.",

      "text": "I'm doing the review for the bar at ground level. The middle-aged male server was friendly, had eye contact, smiled, etc. The two foreign female workers were very rude. No eye contact at all, no 'here you go' when they serve drinks, they just put it on the table and quickly walked away. No 'thank you' or 'please come again' when I made payment as well. Doesn't made me feel welcomed at all.\n\nWhat kind of customer service is this? Very rude and untrained. The management should really remind these 2 princesses that the basic rule of customer service is to not be rude. If I'm the boss here, I would have fired these 2 ladies. If they're not happy working there, they should not be working there and not show their attitude to their customers. I give credit where it's due and criticisms when it's deserved. I hope the management would do something about this.",

If you're concerned about the music from the wine bar below, don't worry as the music won't be able to reach the upper floors. As for the convenience of the location, food choices are abundant tho most would be Chinese-oriented. Now comes the part of service. If you're the type to expect prompt responses from the reception etc, perhaps you should seek other hotels.",
