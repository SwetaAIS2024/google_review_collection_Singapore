Marcus Tan,4,"This was a newly opened Kopitiam 20 - 25mins away from our house. We have always wanted to try out the Tze char (Jia Yan Seafood) here as the dishes look tasty but we were busy, and we have finally got the chance to do so today!

We ordered 3 dishes:
1. Cai Poh Beancurd
2. Sambal Sweet Potato Leaf
3. Cantonese-style steamed Garoupa

The overall verdict is that itâ€™s above average. The sweet and savoury Cai Poh is well fried, and itâ€™s layered on top of the beancurd which is crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside. The amount of sauce was just alright; not too much, not too little. It tasted much better than the same dish that we usually see at ä¸‰ç›…ä¸¤ä»¶.

Steamed Garoupa tasted fresh. Because the candles below are heated up, it keeps the sauce (and the fish) piping hot for a longer time, which adds to its tastiness.

We thought the sambal sweet potato leaf was quite ordinary - typical sambal fried leaf. The saving grace is that the sambal is slightly spicy, and itâ€™s not too oily.

The downside? We thought the portions were slightly on the smaller side, and itâ€™s not very cheap. Bear in mind the price shown on the receipt is not accurate - we topped up an additional $6 to switch from Steamed fish head with black bean sauce to Cantonese-style steamed Garoupa.

Definitely an above average Tze-char we would recommend. As they are still quite new, hopefully they keep up with their standards as time passes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114358279135892939279/reviews
yvonne ooi,1,"Hor fun should be the easiest and fastest dish but they serve last instead. Waited for 30mins for my 1st dish to be served. When I check with them, the counter lady told me they are cooking it(maybe afraid I cancel the order?) After 30 mins of waiting & 10 mins of waiting after check with the counter lady, she comes and inform me that the marmite pork rib I ordered out of stockâ€¦ I mean they canâ€™t inform me earlier ? The food is nice but Iâ€™ve eaten better and for the service? They need to improve lmao But I guess they donâ€™t care since they think thereâ€™s still other customer than me. Also I found hair in my Hor Fun after Iâ€™ve waited for 40 mins ðŸ« ",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105149178200967168556/reviews
Cindy Choong,2,"Food is fresh, just edible.
No skill in bringing the best flavor out.
Simple noodle dishes are a bit blend and stingy in ingredient.
We thought dishes will be better but it does taste like how it should be but just sweet ...

I'd go elsewhere if I have a choice.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106060270000394610541/reviews
Bryan Soo,5,"Amazing! Good food. Ive had many dishes. Curry pork, prawn roll, asam fish head, pork ribs, brocolli and moreâ€¦

Every dish was superb. Thick and fragrant curry, prawn roll with fresh prawns, not frozen, fish head had some of the freshest fish ive had from SG kopitiams, pork ribs were tender and full of flavour, brocolli was cooked perfectly (which is really rare).

Those that talk about serviceâ€¦ honestly its not bad at all. But dont expect hotel seafood or big restaurant service. Cmon its just a kopitiam zi char. Wan good service dont cheapskate la",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106960003819494388191/reviews
Edmund Lee,1,This is my first n last time of patronising them. I ordered the chic cube fried rice for my boy. Portion was good but the taste was terrible. The chic cube was not fresh n had this weird taste.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100573818746255326827/reviews
