SK Ho,5,"This is our go to take away dinner zhi char stall whenever we can't think of what to eat for dinner. We usually call in advance to order our food and then go over to collect. I don't understand the poor rating. So far, based on our many years of experience with the stall, service is good and they are fast. Food is of good standard. A good range of variety to choose from. Don't have the thirtsy feeling after consumption and is not too oily. Will continue to patronize the stall.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106052152130933399046/reviews
Victor HTL,5,"Don’t really understand why the bad rating, this is the best Zi Char Store in the neighbourhood, maybe excluding their Hor Fun (really needs to improve back to before) , but other than that, highly recommend any dish of theirs",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105722555913037451991/reviews
Sean Goh,4,"Ming’s kitchen has a chain of zhichar stalls island wide. I have already seen a few of their stalls in various coffeeshop. Happen to be in Marine Terrace area and decided to give this place a try. We were there around 7pm and there were many people having takeaway.

Ordered three dishes and the food didn’t take long to arrive although the staff did inform us that there is at least 30mins waiting time. We order the 3 cups chicken, stir fry Hongkong Kailan with garlic and fuyong omelette.

Food was not bad, got nothing much to complain about. 3 cups chicken was quite good, unlike most place where they chicken piece with bone, they use chicken thigh here, much convenient to eat.

Overall, worth coming back again to try other dishes.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Jimmy Ng,1,"The food this evening was terrible
1) egg omelette is so salty & there is a big egg shell in it.
2) the deer meat hot plate is not piping hot. It’s lukewarm
3) the Kai lan is like boiled, tasteless & no salt
4) the soup has a lot of ingredients & acceptable taste

The cook is like soulless
Really unacceptable",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105298090362884937115/reviews
Romain Wolff,2,"Very bad experience at this stall. Ordered 2 portions of Sing Chow Beehoon, but got kids size, containers were not even half full for $9.40!! Also beehoon wasn't fully cooked!! Very disappointing! Seems like cook only made one portion by mistake and then split it into 2 portions, didn't border to make a 2nd one! Not serious to run a business like that!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110278216595217271537/reviews
