Chin Kok Leong,5,"Dr Tang is an excellent doctor for my whole family. We have been seeing her and be her first patient whenever we need to visit the clinic. Treatment is always detail and thoroughly examined. This explain the longer time per patient.

The clinic staff are also helpful and friendly. Some retired staff too since we have been long with the clinic led by Dr Tang.

Thank you for the service, Dr Tang and team to this community and being patient with us.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106241934997453928549/reviews

Chelsey MN,3,"Process was smooth and the numbers went by quickly. We were served by Doctor Desmond Yang who was a knowledgeable, down to earth and funny doctor. Even though I went in with a lot of pain and discomfort, he could make my mum and I laugh. I really appreciated that. When collecting the medication from the counter staff, my mum asked for the name of the Doctor and said she would want to look for him from now onwards because he was only a temporary doctor here. She was obviously joking and said that with a laugh because of how comfortable our experience was. I think it is a great compliment for a doctor to have because his patients are thankful. However, the indian counter staff behind the lady that was serving us made rude eyes at my mum and made snarky remarks which was rather uncalled for. She did this behind my mum’s back, not knowing that I noticed it from my angle. What was so wrong with what my mum said? She was complimenting the doctor yet she got weird stares from a lady that was not even serving us. Really uncalled for. I could not tell her off as I was not well but it honestly broke my heart to see someone treating my mum this way. Really unprofessional. Please refrain from doing so or be more aware of your surroundings. The lady looked young and my mum is 54 so please have a heart. That said, thank you to the Doctor and the lady that gave us the medication.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116351244809472780045/reviews
