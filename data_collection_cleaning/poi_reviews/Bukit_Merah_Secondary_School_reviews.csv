Jonathan George,5,"I am not a student, but I recently had the opportunity to be welcomed into Bukit Merah Secondary School along with a cohort of 12 teachers in training from the USA.

The administration at Bukit Merah was extremely welcoming, organized and professional from the moment I first reached out to them to ask if they were interested in a cultural exchange with teachers from the US.  Through the planning of this exchange visit, we had nothing but pleasant experiences, and were very impressed with the level of commitment and professionalism shown by the administration.  They clearly are educators and are interested in professional learning and providing opportunities for their students to engage in experiential learning by hosting our group.

On the day of our exchange, we had the opportunity to meet with current teachers, administration, and students.  We shadowed lessons, had numerous sessions with both students and teachers, and were able to learn a great deal about the Singaporean education system, and life in Singaporean school.  Our entire team was extremely impressed with the level of quality that we witnessed both in terms of facilities, and pedagogy, and facilitation.   The students were all very welcoming, and we wish we had more time to get to know them and spend at Bukit Merah.

In our short time here, we took away numerous learnings, and understandings.  We saw engaged students learning in professional settings with high quality educators. Our own students now have new tools to use in their own classrooms, and we have new friends. We can't thank everyone involved in this visit enough.  Thank you!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103647330595964144667/reviews
del,1,"This school was honestly quite an experience for me, although there were some good times here i would like to speak up about somethings.

Band. our school‚Äôs band committee/exco members, like how someone actually vapes in there and brings his vape and lets his friends in band actually see and touch his vape? And apparently, MOST of the band members and committee knows he‚Äôs vaping and yet, no one is taking action about this. Furthermore, whenever some of us did something wrong, we had to either ‚Äúfall out‚Äù(run 1 lap across the corridor) or do individual punishment, i get that their trying to promote discipline but tell me why when the alumnus visit the band, they start spectating and laughing at us while we are already being humiliated enough? The band also likes to extort money from its own members as in for example, you forgotten to bring your band file (something to keep all ur music sheets) you have to pay like $2 for a replacement. It‚Äôs hilarious cuz why are they overcharging us students when you can literally get it printed for a cheaper price if you go to the bookshop????? Even worst was when the school personally had someone to ask about this extortion problem and had the band to stop the extortion. I mean i get that our school band has little budget but it doesn‚Äôt give them the right to overcharge for these small little things?

Lastly, Bullying. The school claims they do not condone nor support any form of bullying. However although i‚Äôve never been subjected to any bullying during my time, i witnessed a lot of my friends break down and cry just because of what happened to them at school. And whenever someone tries and tells the teacher without proof, the teacher just asked them to calm down and stop overreacting. Many of these bullies are even from the schools own prefect or this year they call it student council. They would talk maliciously among themselves about a person they do not like or try to isolate the person from their friends, do you guys really call yourselves leaders by doing all these actions? This resulted in my friend being afraid to even step foot into this school and her mental wellbeing and you guys still claim you care a lot for your students when in reality you guys literally let these little incident slip and thus resulted in the students affected to suffer more.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114410324962598126106/reviews
Shu,1,"Being an alumnus of this school from some years back, I think it's important that I speak up about this to inform school faculty/current batch of students to school since I find this issue very serious and I think that it's a must that awareness regarding this issue is raised.

BULLYING. I was not subjected to any form of bullying but I was a witness as it took place in my class. Let‚Äôs name this classmate X. Many classmates in my class isolated them and verbally bullied him, causing them to skip school. At first, they skipped one day‚Ä¶then two‚Ä¶ and eventually it was long lengthy periods of many days which ended up in them dropping out entirely. I believe the reason was the teacher‚Äôs lack of interference was involved in this result. Every time X came back to school, many in my class would ignore him, acting like he isn‚Äôt there and making fun of him while he and the teacher was present. When X wasn‚Äôt at school, someone would be cracking jokes about them while the teacher was there and the teacher just told the class to settle down and get their homework out. Thus, I am very sure that the teacher does know that X is being bullied because I know that the teacher talked to them about their suicide letter. Even if they didn‚Äôt act upon it, I feel that the teacher should‚Äôve seen it as a cry of help and tried to offer support instead of just staying quiet when classmates are making fun of him for not doing it. I know that the school tried to help him by sending him to the school councillor but I feel that further action should‚Äôve been taken.

CCA. Specifically Band. Now tell me why a band cca has a whole punishment system in place that literally serves no purpose but to bully and humiliate band members. Making them do planks, do jumping jacks while shouting ‚ÄúI LOVE BAND‚Äù, running around the corridor, in front of the entire band while shouting and scolded at them. I understand that punishment is needed to enforce discipline but I think this is really too far. Especially when other factors that I‚Äôm going to bring up is going to make this entire system really unjustified.

Abuse of leadership, the band leaders seem to love to abuse their powers. I feel that they love to just enforce more stricter punishments on people they simply don‚Äôt like. For instance, we had to clean the school toilets and because let‚Äôs call this person Y, didn‚Äôt leave the floor clear of HAIR, (it was only 4 strands in a corner, you had to have been closely scrutinising it to even notice it) Y was berated, shouted at for 5mins while made to do punishment. The toilet was already relatively cleaned, the seniors simply just did this because they didn‚Äôt like them.

Also, the leaders of band are known for vaping, chasing after juniors to date/have sexual relations with them with the teachers fully knowing this. But they‚Äôre still made the leaders because they practise and play the instrument well, so they are well liked by them. However, shouldn‚Äôt ethics and values be considered as well in choosing a leader?????

Lastly, ableism. Some members in the CCA clearly have forms of autism/adhd. And it is very obvious that the teachers are very ableistüò≠ The instructor and teachers shouting and screaming at them to behave simply won‚Äôt do anything, let alone the band leaders bullying and humiliating them. I know that they are quite annoying because they may behave and do strange things but if they‚Äôre that much of a hindrance I believe the teachers should‚Äôve just transferred them to another CCA, because they cannot control it.

Anyways, idk if the Japanese food stall is still there but the curry rice is so fireüôèüî•",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110415664419902823867/reviews
