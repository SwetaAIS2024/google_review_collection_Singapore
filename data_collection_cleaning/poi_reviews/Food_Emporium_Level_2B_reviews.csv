Ng Family,3,Nicely decorated food court in Changi Airport Terminal 4. A decent variety of stalls though quite a few stalls have closed down and are empty now. The hokkien noodles served very yummy noodles. Prices are higher than normal food court. Thereâ€™s a dragon playground themed dining area for children.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113590041079133861705/reviews
Hartono Harjono,5,"Located at level 2, take escalator 1 level up. Tried signature prawn me. Comes with prawn and lala too! Price $6.8 or $5.8 if you flash your NTUC member/CC card. The food was delicious!! Pork and duck rice is very nice too! Worth it every cent.

Flo Yeow,5,"If you're visiting Terminal 4 for whatever reasons, and are in need of some affordable food options, this is the place to go. It's a very typical Singapore food centre, but the quality and cleanliness is of a much higher level. Prices are generally higher as well as a result of the entire dining experience that you get, but it's worthwhile relatively to the other dining options that you have here.

The few stalls that I'd recommend are the fried hokkien noodles stall at the end (I tried their black carrot cake, and the guy really used his heart and soul in cooking that plate of carrot cake), the roasted meat stall, and the Kim Chu dumpling stall at the entrance.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Ali Chua,5,"For the fact that it's a food centre at Changi Terminal 4, this place went beyond my expectations. Quality of stalls and food are generally much better than what you'd get outside at other food centres, and the experience is much cleaner and worthwhile. Prices can be high too, given that things generally start at $5.50, but for the entire dining experience that you're getting, it sure makes it alright. The hokkien noodles stall is not bad, and the roasted meat stall as well. The Kim Chu dumpling stall at the entrance, although much pricier than usual, is also something worth trying especially for tourists visiting.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114592888179182991710/reviews
