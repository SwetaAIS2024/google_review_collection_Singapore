thelevitator,4,"Had the Fish and Chips ($7.50). Fish was rather small, but since they gave 2 I can't complain. The fish was nicely fried, nd the fries were well seasoned. However, I was not sure why the outside of the bun looked so oily. Were they trying to fry it but ran out of time?

Still a great plate of fish and chips for the price though. Might come back for another.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102689218568385117662/reviews
Keng Cheong Tan,4,One of the best coffee shops in Bukit panjang with a variety of good tasting dishes. The Koka noodles is famous and people come here in the wee hours for it. Other stalls are great too such as the chicken rice and western food,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102762619432424724330/reviews
Tan Benson,4,"Best economical rice in Bukit panjang area. Food taste delicious as can see ppl queuing during lunch and dinner time.

The cook and boss don't cut cost by saving on raw ingredients. They make sure food cook out are frangance. Amaze bean sprout cook with salted fish, vegetable cook with dried shrimp.

Unlike social enterpriae rice garden, food taste cannot make it. Use cheap quality rice.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117316360101587501535/reviews
Cherry Tan,1,"Do think twice about eating Mala in this coffeeshop. I had my doubts on whether the food was really being charged by the weight or that a tare was made to ensure that the weight measured excludes the weight of the bowl. The weighing balance was also always being kept in the shop which shows a lack of transparency. When I took the same items but in lesser quantity, the price stayed the same. Will NOT be patronizing this unethical shop again, highly recommend considering having Mala at the shopping malls nearby instead which might cost even lesser and at a better environment.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100529229386387656507/reviews
