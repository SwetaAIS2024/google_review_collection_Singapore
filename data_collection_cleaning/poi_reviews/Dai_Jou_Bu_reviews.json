They also serve fried food on Wednesday. Always have long queues and is a fan favourite among ACSI students.",

My favourite is the oyako don, a normal one would be $2.50 but I feel ordering the $3 one would be more worth the money. On Fried Food day, (Wednesday) There would be pineapple rice and bee hoon with fried food such as chicken, mushroom & crab stick. There is also Chawanmushi for $0.70. üëçüèªüëçüèª",
