pengurus kmmgpo,5,"Very happy to worship at Orchard Presbyterian Church, easy to reach from MRT station & bus stop.  The welcome is warm & friendly, there are also worship fellowships where you can build friendships and get to know each other from various ethnicities. One of my experiences in the Martha & Maria worship service was that there was also a sailor's service, not only did we get to know each other, but we were also given the opportunity to share testimonies of our lives that we had experienced in God.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113869338048406832470/reviews
