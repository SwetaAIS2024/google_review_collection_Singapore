The pork slices were very tender. Pork lard also added for those who like some crunch. Should be eaten with their sambal chilli. Instead I made the mistake of having it with red cut chilli. Didn‚Äôt try the other dishes so no comments.",

Rest of the dishes are salty and serving size small for the price of $11 each. Prawn paste chicken had no smell of the distinct paste smell. Bowl of white rice will cost you 70cent. If they cannot even get the staple zhi char dishes right, don‚Äôt bother with the other more complex dishes",
