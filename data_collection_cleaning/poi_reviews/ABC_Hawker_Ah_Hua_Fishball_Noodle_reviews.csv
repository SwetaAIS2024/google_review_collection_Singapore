Sam Liew,5,"It has been years that I patronised this stall located at the newly renovated hawker ctr.
Ordered a bowl of $4.50 minced meat fishball dry mee pok, my mee pok is cooked perfectly - al dente, wonderfully springy.
The few slices of fish cake is awesome, together with the minced meat, it makes my bowl of mee pok become wholesomely delicious.
The bowl of mix meat balls and fish balls are highlight of the meal, the uneven shaped balls have good texture, each bite is fresh and just bouncy enough.
The soup is flavourful and not salty too, garnished with spring onions and preserved vegetables, it is clear, light and comforting.
The middle-aged lady who took our order is efficient, she is systematic and wonderfully friendly.
I will definitely come back again.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101928544135913893508/reviews
Darryl Liew,5,Friendly aunties at the stall. Chilli packs a kick so ask for less chilli if you can't take spice. Old school handmade fishball noodles,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109927442644026176685/reviews
L.G. Wee,4,"Dec 2021. I had to go to CMPB this morning and wanted to try my luck at the food centre for 胡须老 noodle. I realised it had shuttered its doors.
Went with ABC Ah Hua fishball noodle instead persuaded by the long queue. I ordered a small version at $3 and added $1.20 for 2 meat balls.
Not bad to be honest. The mee kia was doused generously with vinegar. The meat and fish balls were handmade.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109126344872816026986/reviews
Timothy TB Chua,5,"I’ve been eating at this stall when they were at ABC Brickworks. Used to be a late night haunt. Nowadays they don’t open late. Also closed on Tuesdays and Fridays. This is a specialist fish ball noodle stall, not a ‘Bak Cho’ mee stall. Hence, I wouldn’t recommend the mee pok. The fish balls are great! Order a $4 portion at least!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113300903581441883110/reviews
