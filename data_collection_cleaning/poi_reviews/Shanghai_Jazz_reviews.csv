Linda Ng,1,"Would like to provide my honest feedback on my experience with Jazz Bar on 5 April at 10pm.

We have ordered the truffle fries but we do not like the sour cream or mayonnaise. The truffle fries has no tinge of truffle oil taste and we have highlighted to your service crew but he replied that the truffle oil is added in the sauce which we totally dislike the taste. We left the fries untouched till the end.

The burger was another tragic, the beef patty was bland and tough. We ate one piece and dared not try more. The food served was a total disappointment. After making payment, we did not even receive any receipt on our spending.

The only thing we find acceptable was the live band.
We have written feedback to the manager in email but to no avail. Therefore, we decided to write it here to remind future customers to think twice before patronizing! The photo taken with food and beverage already cost 650 yuan! I ordered another apple juice at 70 yuan to meet the cover charge at 700 yuan(2 pax)!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110100969029397119730/reviews

Christina Goh,4,"Everything is up to standard. But there is no happy hour. Beer and finger price is not cheap. No food, only finger food when we went during the evening.  Service is great, very prompt and accommodating!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109283220552927520773/reviews
Benjamin Hakim,1,"Food was decent, but that's all there is to it. If I could give this zero stars, I would. Even if all the bars close business in the whole of SG, I wouldn't come back to revisit, and that really speaks for itself.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113132931265505073155/reviews
Chris Chye,5,Good place to chill and drink. There's bartender and waitress to chill with as well. Alcohol and food price is good as there's always with promotion. There's ktv and pool too. Recommended place to go ! Opening till 3am on weekdays and 4am on weekend. Sunday is open as well,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114362237764050391573/reviews
