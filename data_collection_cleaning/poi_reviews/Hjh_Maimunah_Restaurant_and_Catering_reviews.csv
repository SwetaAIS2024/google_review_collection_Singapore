Green Gollum,5,"Needless to say, the long queue was well worth it. Rendang was tender and yet held its shape. That was the main highlight. Everything else was more than decent too. Taste and texture was definitely what we were going for. 35 bucks for everything felt very very justifiable. Craving satisfied, hearts contented, stomachs filled. ðŸ’šðŸ’šðŸ’š",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104848053712964216212/reviews
Yvonne Tan,5,"I guess the ordering system is like most nasi padang, where u can have the sides together, or separately on plates (a lot of customers did that to share the sides).

Queue starts from the dish side and when I arrived at 11.40am, there was no queue. Once I got my food and paid, there was a 5-6 pax queue. After I had my lunch, the queue was something like 15-20 pax! Come early if you donâ€™t want to queue

I had their sayur lodeh (yums), sambal quail eggs (spicy and yums), chicken rendang (yums again). My only complaint qualm is that I wished the dishes were hot / warm. Some of the dishes was getting a little cold.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116951738481823875805/reviews
John K,5,"Really enjoyed the food here. Great classic Malay cuisine, reasonably priced and comfortable dine-in space.  Iâ€™m surprised I did not know this place having grown up all my life here in Singapore. Thanks to my friend who recommended this place to me for lunch today.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109135106185124495385/reviews
Johanna Hanny,5,"This place serves the best Nasi Campur in town, period! The flavors are incredible and leave me craving for more. Haven't found anything quite like it! Just be preparedâ€”the queue can get really long, especially during office lunch hour.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104426067676310731633/reviews
Syaz AR,5,"For a good fix of malay food - you must come here!

The prices are reasonable, portions are massive but best of all food taste great!

They have great deals for sets and also a pretty good selection of dishes to choose from

Getting a spot to sit might be a bit challenging since its rush hour practically every hour here, but its not impossible ðŸ˜¹",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105503510748325012103/reviews
