Dolphee Lee,5,"Thank you, Mr Ryan.Ang, for attendingto our inquiries,
patiently addressing our doubts, providing suggestions how to go about making payment for an elderly lady, trying to make payment at the AXS machine. You went the extra mile informing that she had no outstanding bill. This gives her a peaceful mind, without worrying of outstanding payment, and save her a trip from traveling down to HDB at Jurong West St 52,  from Jurong West.St 91. This meant a lot as she has difficulty walking long distance. it's definitely inspiring to know there are passionate and loving people  out there making this world a better place every moment!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103400678482689941359/reviews

MARK TAN,1,"I called the branch before 9.30am regarding a renovation work going on on the upper floor. I was made to hang on the phone for more than 30 minutes for a officer to attend to me but there wasn't anyone. I have to no choice but to hang up.

Definitely could provide better service to the public, what's the point of having a hotline when no one attends to it.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104830968328268339504/reviews
