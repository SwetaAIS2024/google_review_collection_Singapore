Cassia A,5,"The black coffee was actually really good! I got an unsweetened black coffee to go and it was fast, pretty cheap, and good.
They were also really nice. I didn’t know the Singaporean coffee naming system, so she asked me several questions to clarify my order.
There’s some seating. Usually a small line at breakfast time.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117662481746295955146/reviews
Daynight NoooGooo,4,"Food is good definitely.. Toast and coffee are nice.
However, met with poor service while collecting coffee.

Brian Claus,5,"Simple, quick breakfasts. Go to place for a quick bite most Sunday mornings for a simple breakfast of scrambled eggs, toast and Kopi (local coffee). For what it is, it gets 5 stars.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100194968913569891982/reviews
Ken Tan,3,Very limited menu options they no longer serve any mains so lunch crowd is practically zero.  Rendang pie and cheese egg tart taste alright so does the teh.  Nice place to sit without any crowd if weather is cool as it is right beside mall entrance.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100121205735734303463/reviews
Lee Adeline,2,"I recently visited your shop and had a mixed experience. Unfortunately, I found the counter cashier and barista to be unfriendly and unapologetic when they missed my order. However, I noticed that the Malay lady at the toast and eggs counter was warm and friendly.

I hope you can look into improving the customer service at the counter and coffee stations. Having a pleasant disposition will help them in their overall wellness and health. It will also improve the customer experience and boost your sales.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104646142844761195857/reviews
