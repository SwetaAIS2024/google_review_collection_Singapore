Jason Lee,4,"I'm a big fan of the fried carrot cake here! The dark version is perfectly balanced - savory and not too sweet. My wife, on the other hand, raves about the white carrot cake, describing it as crispy and packed with flavor. We're both impressed with the quality and taste of these dishes!""",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117371894884760957562/reviews
Mandy Ting,5,"Hidden gem in Bangkit. Tried the crispy prawn pancake.  crispy, flavourful and have wok hey. Their homemade chilli dip is super good, mild spicy and sour. Would definitely visit again to try their char kueh tiaw, carrot cake, hokkien mee and oyster pancake.

Kudos to the old couples!

Gentle remind that they do not open on Sundays. Please also give a little patience while waiting for the good food.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103669953371818547430/reviews

Al Tan,4,"Was around the area. Saw the ""hidden gem""
5 star star review below and decided to give it a try. Ordered fried prawn mee and carrot cake. First bite, I think the above review was much overrated. The carrot cake blend AF. Definitely can't taste any wok hey. There was a funny taste in the yellow prawn mee. The prawns are fresh though. After finishing the food, I still think it's very much overrated.
Initially thought of just leaving without finishing the food but don't wanna waste. The food is edible.
Didn't want to leave any bad reviews but don't want people to get misled by the hidden gem review below.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110930297144432722959/reviews
