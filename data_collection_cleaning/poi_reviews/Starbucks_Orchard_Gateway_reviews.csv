Elle,5,"we decided to stop by this starbucks for a quick pick-me-up! we got our go-to iced strawberry black tea lemonade which was delicious as always. the staff were incredibly friendly, and were very prompt in giving us our drinks! this starbucks is also very eco-friendly as they give you reusable cups if you're dining in. we would definitely recommend this starbucks!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106013306939322706772/reviews
R W,2,"Pretty standard Starbucks. Not as cosy as some other outlets but has several low coffee tables w cushioned chairs.

Staff was efficient... I found a dead cockroach under my table and reported it. One of the cashiers promptly came and cleared it away with a broom.

While it doesn't speak much about the sanitation status of the outlet, at least the staff dealt promptly with the issue.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106168104360625045740/reviews

c,1,"person with glasses movements are extremely slow, just because ur not rushing doesnt mean others arent rushing, why are u taking mroe than 10min to make one drink and serving customers that ordered after us first? absolutely no sense of urgency at all, if you want to hire fnb workers make sure they know how to move with a fast pace? are you disabled or handicapped? do you have a disability where you function 2x slower than others? absolutely horrible service",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103676412749344461597/reviews
Bryan Lon,1,"I came here expecting to do some quick work while I enjoy my coffee. I ended up paying $9 for a coffee that wasn't even nice and a place that has power outlets but none of them are working. What happened to Starbucks? Now I can't even charge my laptop anymore. 1 stars for this Starbucks. This ain't a Starbucks, it's just a bucks ðŸ¤¡.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101869506055887544256/reviews
