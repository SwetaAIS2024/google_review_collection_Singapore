Nice sweet sambal sauce to perfectly go with rice.\n\nFor the lala, we went with the kum heung sauce for something different. Very fragrant and every morsel is coated in the goodness.\n\nFresh green veggie stir fried with mushrooms and garlic bits.\n\n5/5 meal as always. Will be back again when I am around the area.\n\nFriendly server uncle too! :)",

The long pony tail lady keeps encouraging me to buy expensive stuff like seafood even though I said no already. Very disappointing Soon Huat\nYou will NEVER SEE ME AGAIN!!!!!\nWASTED MY DINNER ON YOU.",

She arrogantly replied ‚ÄúFish scale lah‚Äù and said to her worker that i don‚Äôt know how to cook? Eh please. People know how to cook ofc, with hygiene lah.

      "text": "$15 of BBQ sotong. Didnt finish half the plate because it's so underwhelming.\n\n1. They didnt remove the outer skin of the sotong properly, and it's a choking hazard bcus the skin is not easy to bite and it's long, thin and stretchy.\n\n2. No taste in the meat. I thought it was steamed sotong instead of BBQ sotong. Maybe cos i didnt order the traditional sambal. Also, Where's the hotplate?\n\n3. Price. Definitely not value for money.",
