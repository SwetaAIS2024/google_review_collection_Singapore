Fiona Loy,1,"Bought a piece of ç™½ç³–ç³•, lady gave me one of those in plastic bag.  Tasted sour, told her n she said itâ€™s normal. Had diarrhoea tat day. Horrible.  All the overnight ç™½ç³–ç³•should be thrown away. Itâ€™s made from rice flour, will taste sour once itâ€™s kept outside long hours.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112537466061909212847/reviews
YÃ¨,4,"Having fond memories of this unassuming stall along the Wisma Atria underground stretch, I was happy to see that itâ€™s there after all these years, pretty kuehs on display at affordable prices. I hope it never leaves.

I have to agree with some reviews regarding the service level that has a lot of room for improvement. Other than that, the traditional kuehs are flavours and textures of childhood, which I will certainly return to occasionally.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110205858157050835887/reviews

Unconventional Passionss,5,"Morning all.

Anyone loves this kueh shop at Wisma Atria?

I still remember like when I was a kid, my parents will always bring us to this shop to takeaway tapioca kuehs and onde onde.

This was when Wisma used to be old school back then.

This stall still looks so traditional. And most times if you are hurrying to Taka, you may miss this hole in the wall gem.

Dom Wee,1,"I wished this could have been better since they have been here so long and they fought and defended their place against the giant Subway. Their kueh lapis was decent. Everything else was bad. Kueh kosui was dry, alkaline lye taste. Salat was so hard and had tasteless rice. Donâ€™t bother with their chendol which was so gross.  Like everyone else saying, the chinese staff didnâ€™t like to serve her customers and had an impatient attitude.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100816623631168791184/reviews
