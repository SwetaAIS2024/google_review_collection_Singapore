Mandy Koh,5,I chanced upon the place when I was in the area. Saw a never ending queue for the prawn noodles and decided to try it. After seeing the reviews then I realized that it's quite famous. Now I'm definitely coming back to try the dry version as the prawn soup is yummy!,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114168371304873568979/reviews
Sam Toh (Sammy),5,"Another ËÇ•‰ªî addition in the coffeeshop, many will remember Tong Lok Kway Chap stall as the predecessor of this stall. Fei Zhai  Teo Chew Braised Pork have taken over with some localicious steam yam cake, buns and also signature Braised Pork Rice. The Braised Pork's taste brings me back the memory lane of hanging around grandma's kitchen and the dish is served with stir fried cabbage and a sunny side up.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110777175975209979259/reviews
LP Pua,4,"The $1.40 kopi-o is more expensive than in other coffee shops, and the taste is slightly on the dilute side.

There are about four food stalls, which is a lot for a small coffee shop.

Parking is free before 8:30 AM, and it is a popular breakfast place.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Eats More Fun,3,"The Damage: $15-20 for two

Corner coffeeshop near the Pasir Panjang station and an entrance to Kent Ridge park. We liked the Prawn and Pork Rib Noodles from Fei Zai

Joel Lee,3,"Decent braised pork rice ($5) sauce was really good but the meat was a little tough

It cost $1.50 to add vegetables.

3 stars because the drink stall is a scam.... They charged my friend $1 for kopi and charged me $1.50 when I dabao (when they clearly used the same amount of coffee)",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113835833722683338610/reviews
