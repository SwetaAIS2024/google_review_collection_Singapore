      "text": "Their briyani was already sold out by the time I arrived on Friday at 11:30 a.m. (a heartbreak moment, honestly).\n\nSo, I settled for white rice and decided to try the kambing curryâ€”and wow, what a surprise! The mutton was so soft it practically melted in my mouth, and the curry was rich, flavorful, and absolutely delicious.\n\nWhile I missed out on the famed briyani, the kambing curry more than made up for it. It is a dish worth returning for, and I might just come earlier next time to get the full briyani experience.\n\nBut for now, that curry? Pure satisfaction.",
