In particular, the zi char store serves especially terrible food - tried the steamed fish (strangely sour) and egg drop soup (tasted like it had gone bad and was so bad that my friends refused to finish it).  The fact that there are so few people eating here is testament to the poor management and food quality. Hopefully the shops here close down soon so the residents can get better food options!",

      "text": "Bought the prawn noodle and paid $5 for it. the portion is so small not even enough to feed a primary school kid, how to feed an adult? Did not ask for what noodles I wanted and soup gave also very little. This coffeeshop has been constantly changing their prawn noodle stalls and it keeps getting worse and worse. The prawn is not even a whole prawn, its probably maximum 2 prawns sliced up. Not to mention the opening hours are so inconsistent. No vibes at this coffeeshop at all as it is so quiet and not all stalls are even occupied.\n\nJust a disappointment at this coffeeshop, the owner needs to do something. It is not at a bad location, there just needs to be more variety.",
