And a teaspoon of ketchup and one slice cucumber!  I think this person anyhow inflate the price! Please check the menu and pricing before ordering. Apparently it happened more than once already!! Felt so cheated !! SGD 7!! For a lousy plate of Maggie mee goreng !!",

Quality of food  to be determined.\n\nUpdated 7th July 2023. So far tried the following:\nThosai / Vadai  - Mediocre, smaller than usual Vadai\n\nPrata - Mediocre with watery curry dip\n\nMee / Bee hoon Goreng - Mediocre\n\nOverall - would rather walk 100m to Blk 158 (Al Vajeha Restaurant). Same prices and menu but better quantity and quality of food.",

The overall vibes make me feel more comfortable.\n\nI ordered mutton briyani with additional veggie, which was satisfying, and not as salty as Al Vajeha. The amount of mutton was also fairly generous. The curry in the small bowl tasted like dhal but I was surprised to find a small piece of mutton on rib bone in it. The briyani with additional veggie cost $8. It also came with a hard-boiled egg, onion salad and a crispy pappadum.",
