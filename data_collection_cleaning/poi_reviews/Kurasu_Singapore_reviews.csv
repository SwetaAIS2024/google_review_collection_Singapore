Lydia Heng,4,"*from a once in a while casual coffee drinker

Taste: 4 stars
Had a white, hot, house blend coffee $6.50. House blend is Recommended if you are not a fan of acidic coffee.

Cup was smaller than what other cafes would give. The coffee was smooth and silky, something I hadn't tasted before in all my coffees at cafes. However it had some other slight taste in it, not sure if it's the milk - however its not a deal breaker

Overall worth a shot to try as I'm impressed with that smooth taste.

4 stars as the price is a little steep for that smaller quantity.

Atmosphere: 2 stars
Came on a 4.30pm Sunday. Packed, had to wait a while for seats.
Giving 2 stars cause it was noisy...

Service was great, someone tends to you and explains/recommends you if you need help.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110477061035605935081/reviews
Kritz Yeoh,5,"Came straight from Apartment to Kurasu for the second coffee spot of my trip ðŸ˜†

Comfier vibes, equally good espresso-based coffee. Got the only thing that was roasted locally in White and it was pretty good! The rest of their stuff is roasted in Kyoto and imported directly.

Snagged some drip bags and filter beans as souvenirs for friends back home (and myself). I liked how they offered 100g bags, less of a commitment.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116854553239407686534/reviews
Cassandra,4,"The cafe can be easily missed. The unit number does not show up on the building's directory. And, there wasn't a contact number stated on google for us to speak to the store staff for directions.

Anyway, we had to take a long walk around the circumference just to try our luck and see if the cafe is still around. You know what I mean. Anyway, upon arrival, we were instructed to sit at a specific area when there were more than enough seats around. Oh well.

As for the drinks, it was pretty good. Thick flavour and it was served in less than 10 minutes.

Ambience wise - renovation was nicely done, with a touch of zen vibes.

However, I would not see this as a cafe where one could chill and have a nice chat without much loud distractions from other tables.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117012786490278517792/reviews
Hana M.K,5,One of the best coffee place hands down. Love the cafe latte and iced matcha! Great and warm service from the staff. Usually full house so may have to wait for awhile for you to get a seat.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114700968507033985627/reviews
Maryana Tan,1,"Matcha is too sweet and milk is overpowering the matcha taste. We were asked to leave under a super heavy pouring rain, the lady and guy told us weâ€™re only entitled to sit for an hour. To extent our seat on such rainy day, we placed our second order. But they prepared it in a takeaway cup without informing and were again asked to leave after 5mins of the second order was served. Very speechless with such poor service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108441495174561352945/reviews
