Maxim Vos,5,"Typical Laksa dish. Friendly employee, very quick service. The food tasted really good with the coconut cream flavor and the spicy touch.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102171350255760675970/reviews
Bun Meng Leng,4,"Had the 5$ laksa. I can tell the broth is very coconutty. I like the shrimp, tofu and fried crispy skin. I'd like a much richer broth so might need more chilli sambal. Overall it's a delicious laksa just wish it was richer in seafood taste and curry paste.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111207537224419024096/reviews
C,2,"Old Nyonya at Maxwell Food Centre serves traditional Peranakan dishes, including laksa. Tried their Signature Laksa ($5), but it was disappointing—the broth was thin and lacked the richness you’d expect. A premium price would have been fine if the taste delivered, but unfortunately, it didn’t match expectations. There are better options around Maxwell for a satisfying bowl of laksa.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews

Timothy Lim DC,3,"Tried this as I love Peranakan food and was drawn by the name. Alamak manis sekali! If you love sweet, sugared broth, this is for you. Probably because they have to skim on the coconut milk. But for $5 you get 2 big prawns, not too oily",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102093172395035257333/reviews
