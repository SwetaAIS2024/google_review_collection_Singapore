Service and food quick and sharp. Recommended for an all day brunch.",

Well, it's a hidden gem in the Beauty World area with a lovely, cozy, yet vibrant vibe, with food that never disappoints and coffee that always blows me away! I come here a lot to do work on my laptop, and always end up spending a couple of hours here, complete with a full meal and drink. The staff are always friendly and welcoming as well :) I think I've made it clear, Revelry is great!",

Waffles were so tasty. Such nice staff and cozy atmosphere, I was impressed! A pretty hidden cozy café that more people should patronise. Thanks for the generous meal! I enjoyed every second of it.",

Food is really good here and coffee is also on point.\nIt’s a tad pricier than the other joints here but you can usually find a seat here and it’s quieter than the other joints on the same street.",
