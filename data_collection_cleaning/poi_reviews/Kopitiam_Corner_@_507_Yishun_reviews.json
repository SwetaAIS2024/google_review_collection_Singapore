      "text": "New: Korean Food stall. I tried Army Stew today. It was delicious but pricey at $18.80 by coffeeshop standards. I would like to taste kimbap and their other menu items.\n\nYou must try chicken bolognese and mushroom aglio olio of TenderBest. You can alternate this western food choice with Chinese econ rice, northern chinese style steamed / fried dumplings with plenty of nittrr gourds n spinach for healthier choice, and treat yourself to delicious lontong & mee sam at the Halal stall. Don't expect good service at drink stall but their black coffee is quite okay. Long queue at drink stall and econ rice during meal peak hours.",

Came in a set of 2 prata and the sugar filling was very evenly distributed, super sinful but damn good.\nAlso tried the FISH SOUP stall and it tasted very healthy. Less saltier than other fish soup places and fish was fresh.",
