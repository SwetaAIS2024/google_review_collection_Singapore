Pearl K,5,"Had an amazing experience with Jennifer! She’s so friendly and relatable, which made the whole process super comfortable. The space is clean, cozy, and private, and she talks you through everything so you know exactly what to expect. The waxing was quick, thorough, and way less painful than I imagined. If you’re looking for someone who makes you feel at ease while delivering great results, Jennifer is the one! Highly recommend!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109968615327949261585/reviews

Nurul Ariany,5,"First time client of hers & the experience and service was superb! Honestly was doubting it at first as it is home-based but from the moment i stepped in till the end of the session, i was so comfortable that i forgot the pain! Very friendly and i had an enjoyable conversation with Jennifer. The service was meticulously fast, i felt so clean after! Even gave me recommendations on how to shape my half wax on my legs according to the dress that i had to wear for an event.  10/10 would recommend and i will definitely come back for more sessions!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101924195284910970477/reviews

Sinthu Rathi,5,"First time going to Wax Loft for service. Very patient, friendly and cosy place.
She took time to complete the neat wax which I love. Less painful as compared to other service providers I have experienced before. She is an expert and advised according to clients' personal needs. Kudos to her 10 years experience in this line which she polished. Regret for not trying her service before . I would highly recommend her service .",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110074111381945304809/reviews
