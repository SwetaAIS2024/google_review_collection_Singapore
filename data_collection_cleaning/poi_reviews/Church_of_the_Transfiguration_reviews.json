      "text": "The stained glass on the altar area is stunning! I also love that it depicts the Transfiguration scene which is not so commonly displayed in most churches. It is important to also remember the important roles of Prophet Elijah and Moses in the history of Salvation.\n\nI really like that the choir chant the Communion Anthipon at the beginning of the communion time. It is so important to reflect on it as well as it builds the right solemn atmosphere for everyone receiving the Holy Communion.\n\nThe Adoration room is good, although a little bit small. It will be better if a thick curtain can be placed at the entrance before people step into the room (so after taking off the shoes) to minimise the noise from outside seeping into the adoration area.\n\nI like that they also have a signage displaying info of the many statues around the church.\n\nImpressed to see the uniformity of the logos of all the ministries in this church. All bear the same background but display different symbol relating to each ministry's mission.\n\nCatholics in SG are so blessed to have another beautiful and reverent church like this one.",
