Aryenne Sim Hyem Nga (Fmss),4,"That’s is actually my alumni school. I’m currently in the secondary school under the same name. The Teachers can be friendly and strict at the same time. Also, the food there are quite cheap and so be prepared to let your child to have a lot of worksheets coming your way. The only concern is that it’s quite far and the hours are quite long. But very good school :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108214460557317153888/reviews

SG Reviewer,5,"The culture is wonderful for the students, nurtured holistically through many significant steps by the great teachers who have led the way since the school’s inception. The stories of greats are embedded in the lives of the children and staff, but most will probably tell you (in a less round-about way) that it’s God’s many blessings.

And they’ll probably keep telling you that till they die",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103264087692610834946/reviews
