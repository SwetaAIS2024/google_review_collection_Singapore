Marcos O. Diogo,5,"People’s shopping mall and that king of shopping mall that every city has where you can find everything.

This is a a tourist attraction itself and it was quite nice to get inside and check out the deals and all products Singapore had to show, my wife and I ended up buying some souveniers and definitely good to be there.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113809644458768259113/reviews

T B,3,"3 stars for 3 reasons

1. If you’re looking for souvenirs this maybe the place for you! They sell magnets, sandals, shoes, iPhone accessories, key chains, food, cloths, aftermarket items, bags and many more thighs to explore!

2. Cheap items for low price but is it really that cheap?

3. Friendly people trying to make a living! Prices are negotiable with some stalls not all!

Minus 2 stars for 2 reasons

1. There’s a stall that sells smoothies! I ordered the worst avocado smoothie in the world! So watered down! Not real avocado!

2. Prices are cheap but if you want cheap cheap souvenirs go to Chinatown!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117931963333707047257/reviews
aidan moeliono,4,"Souvenir hunter-bargainer enthusiast must visit.
I guess there are also somekind of quantity vs quality balancing act at play.

Do you buy volume for cheap, therefore the quality probably is not as good?
Or do you buy the better quality hence higher price?
Are you sure? :)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105882404847094526851/reviews
Lintang Pratama,5,"Its pack of people. But yet this place pack of happiness also. People came and go, walking while buying stuff for present or for them self.

Everything are in order. No stall selling their stuff with overprised rate. You can do bargaining here, but the seller is not giving much cut for the prise. Its better to prepare your money, and bring it more if you love shopping.

There is a cctv and officer everywhere. So make sure you bring your document and not committing something suspicious. Hehehe...

You can enjoy a street food also in here. And everything is under 5 minute of walking, so it is very accessable.

Some unique stuff is just around the corner.. so make sure you exploring it first before you decide to buy some thing... your dream stuff maybe just hidden somewhere to buy.

Happy shopping..",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102917008529513203849/reviews
