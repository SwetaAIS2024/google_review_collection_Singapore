Gary Chen,5,"Our daughter absolutely loves this preschool! It's been an incredible experience for her, and we couldn't be happier with the progress she's made. The teachers are warm, caring, and truly dedicated to providing a nurturing environment for the children.

From day one, we noticed a positive change in our daughter's attitude towards learning. She comes home excited every day, eager to show us what she's learned. It's amazing to see her confidence grow as she demonstrates her newfound knowledge and skills.

The curriculum at this preschool is fantastic. They have a well-rounded approach that focuses on both academic and social development. Our daughter has been exposed to a variety of subjects, including math, language, science, and art. It's impressive how much she's absorbed in such a short period.

Overall, we couldn't be more pleased with our choice of Silk Education for our daughter.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112760633537483536151/reviews
Abby Yang,5,"I can't say enough positive things about my child's experience at this preschool. The teachers are truly exceptional - they have a heart full of love for each and every child in their care. They are incredibly caring, patient, and attentive, and they create a warm and nurturing environment that makes the children feel safe and secure.

The curriculum is thoughtfully designed to promote learning and development, and my child has grown so much during her time here. She comes home every day excited to tell me about all the things she's learned, from new songs and stories to new friends and experiences.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with our experience at this preschool. It's clear that the teachers and staff truly care about the children and are dedicated to providing them with the best possible start in life. I would highly recommend this preschool to any parent looking for a caring, nurturing, and high-quality early childhood education program.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118014287080533831277/reviews
