You can tell that the mosque has been serving the community for a long time as it is due for a slight sprucing but the volunteers in here are extremely friendly. The prayer hall however is clean and comfortable to pray in.\n\nHDB parking available at the blocks (~130-150, Bedok Reservoir Rd) opposite the masjid. Very convenient for drivers.",

      "text": "Beautiful mosque with a rich history. Since it's located around a few open fields, it gets very breezy and makes it very comfortable to sit in and around the compound of the masjid. It has been fairly recent that some renovations has been completed; mega fans and more space for the mukmin to pray and it can get packed (Alhamdulilah) on public holidays so be sure to leave the house earlier on those days to get a seat. May you be rewarded for visiting the masjid frequently in this life and the next Amin Ya'raab. Note: the pic is from a distance away but at night, the \"minaret\" lights up green which is pretty cool to look at ðŸ˜€",
