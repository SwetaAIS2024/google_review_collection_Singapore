Stephanie Foo,5,"It was such a memorable and heartwarming experience at this vegan omakase.

Every dish was so thoughtfully prepared, allowing the natural flavors of the ingredients to shine through without the need for oil or salt and this is truly refreshing and impressive in every way.

What made it even more special was the chef‚Äôs personal touch. The way each course was introduced with such passion made us feel genuinely welcomed and taken care of throughout the meal.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for something unique, wholesome, and meaningful. A perfect reminder that healthy food can be both exciting and absolutely delicious. Can‚Äôt wait to be back again!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116184192347100128460/reviews

Wayne Hades,5,I think Joyce‚Äôs food deserves 6 stars. I tried her omakase menu and it was fantastic. The chef‚Äôs ability to combine various vegan ingredients to create dishes with harmonious flavour is simply impressive. The ‚Äúroselle ginger apple lemon tea‚Äù is the most delicious lemon tea i have ever tried. I would highly recommend that you try their vemakase regardless of whether you are a vegan or not.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102029207268571110740/reviews
Jane N,5,"Excellent gluten free vegan Japanese omakase! Delicious and creative dishes. I‚Äôm not vegan but I came here with a vegetarian friend and we were delighted. Very enjoyable meal.

There‚Äôs only omakase menu, no a la carte. The drinks were great too - I had the black goji tea and topped up hot water a few times. The kombucha mocktail was refreshing and delicious.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108512285227866704341/reviews
