      "text": "The coffee shop is overpriced—Milo costs $3?! The service at the drink stall is consistently poor. They often mix up orders and refuse to correct their mistakes, telling us to just take what they gave, even when it’s clearly not what we ordered.\n\nThe one saving grace is the Chenghao Spinach Yong Tau Foo stall. The uncle there is generous with his portions and the food is genuinely good—I highly recommend it.\n\nIf I could give this coffee shop 0 stars, I would. But I’ll give +1 star just for the Yong Tau Foo uncle.\n\nAnd if you bring other food in they will chase u out",

Make the wrong choice to go w the queue option, waited 20mins.\n\nCai fan not nice, the Thai chilli tofu tasted weird\n\nGreen curry can eat but its on the watery side.\n\nThey sell fresh coconut at $3.50 which is reasonable.\n\nOnly 2 stalls opening on weekends.\n\nGotta give 1 star because food is not nice here",
