Mandy (Rin),5,"Consistent quality and serving of food.. keep it up! Coffee is great too.

Would like to thank the staff for agreeing to make a new cup of coffee because I must have keyed wrongly at the kiosk.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112464850479125656421/reviews
Stephanie Tan,4,"Braised pork rice was made of pork belly bits, which made the dish rich and flavourful. Braised soy egg was the highlight for me! Pork chop went nicely with the dried chilli sauce. Topped up $2.2 for a hot drink plus sugared toast.

There seems to be a good variety of toasts available, will return to try other things on the menu",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116228909321338746629/reviews
June,5,"Pork egg omelette: not crispy but tastes really good

Braised pork rice: value for money and tastes almost authentic

Zi char style fish and chicken rice were not bad. Almost like normal zi char.

Will definitely return!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105169174857655588987/reviews
Lilac Grace,3,"The popcorn chicken rice was very nice, but the signature milk tea somehow has some coffee taste, not sure if its meant to be or its an accidental mix. Drinks price is more on the costly side, and few options. Happens to be located just a few shops away from ximenjie which has more varied and affordable drink options.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109911268386974211865/reviews
