Kelvin Chan,5,"Bought my CNY plants from Lovely Landscape. We‚Äôve been to many nurseries across the island, but seldom see one that is packed with plants that are notably well cared for, not to also mention that the variety of plants relative to the nursery size is impressive. We were served by Johan, an experienced staff who was personable and patient with our multiple questions and requests. He readily went on to serve the other customers who quickly approached him after us. Thanks for the pleasant experience! üëçüèªüí™üèªüòÅ",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104202691636190393753/reviews

Radha Govind,1,"I bought more than $1k of indoor plants from them. When I was buying they were very friendly. Within a week, the plants started to wither and leaves started dropping and turning yellow. When I contacted them, the salesmen said the problem is my house and not their plants. He also said, there‚Äôs no warranty or guarantee on plants.
I will not recommend this nursery to anyone. They take your money and give you very bad service! I‚Äôm now left with dying indoor plants, spend more money to replace them. Certainly will not go back to them.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111259729539435015762/reviews
