Ryan Ardiansyah,5,"Hit up the Google Asia Pacific HQ on Nov 18, 2023, for the Devfest GDG Singapore 2023. üöÄ

The vibe at Google‚Äôs office? Super warm and modern. Spotless, too! Registration was a breeze with the friendly, smiling crew. üòä

The Devfest crew? Total A++ for friendliness and professionalism! Everything ran smooth, barely a hitch. Ended up chatting with one of the crew members - super humble and cool.

Also got to meet loads of new peeps and attend some killer sessions by Google Dev Experts. As a huge fan of developing Google Maps apps, these sessions were mind-blowing! üåêüìç

In a nutshell, the Devfest at Google HQ was an epic mix of warm vibes, slick organization, and mind-expanding learning. Networking with new faces and diving deep into Google Maps app development was the cherry on top. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one! üåü",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109078852656648416502/reviews
Dat Nguyen,5,"I recently had the opportunity to visit the Google Singapore office, and I was blown away by how awesome it is. The office is located in the heart of the city, and it has a stunning view of the Marina Bay skyline. The space is designed to be both functional and inviting, with plenty of natural light and comfortable seating. There are also plenty of amenities, such as a gym, a cafeteria, and a game room.

One of the things that I really liked about the Google Singapore office is the way that it encourages collaboration. There are plenty of spaces where people can gather to work together, such as the open-plan workspaces and the breakout areas. There is also a strong sense of community at the office, with many opportunities for people to socialize and get to know each other.

Overall, I think that the Google Singapore office is one of the best office spaces that I have ever seen. It is a great place to work, and it is clear that Google is committed to creating a positive and productive work environment.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108256891841165879254/reviews

Kat C,5,"To be able to get a Google Tour, you need somebody working there to tour you around. They have so much food honestly. Great to work there esp with their work culture. Also, a beautiful Google campus.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107123848617222205075/reviews
