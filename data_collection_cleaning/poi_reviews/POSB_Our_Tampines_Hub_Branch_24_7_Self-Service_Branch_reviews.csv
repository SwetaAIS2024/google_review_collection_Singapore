Poh Guan Yeo (Ah Baoooo),5,"If you are coming down from the escalators, you will have to walk all the way in towards the carpark entrance, it will be on your right side.

There are only ATMs here, is not a physical branch, however there is a VTM (Video teller machine) located inside the room (glass door). You have the option to speak face-to-face with a customer service officer if you require assistance, but you will need a physical POSB/DBS card to verify your personal details.

The deposit machine able to deposit $2 & $5 notes (for those needed this info), take note of the max notes for each deposit.

It's 24hrs since you can access from the stairs/escalators/lift from level 1.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106873177207629158347/reviews
