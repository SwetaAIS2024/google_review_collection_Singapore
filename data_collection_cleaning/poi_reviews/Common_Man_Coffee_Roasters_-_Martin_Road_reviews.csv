Kanwipa Chi,5,Overall pleasant experience. I ordered salted caramel pancake for myself which tbh it looks very sweet but somehow the pancake texture is light and makes it easier to finish the entire plate without feeling too stuffed +  itâ€™s not overly sweet as it seemed. The savory full breakfast also well prepared and tastes good. Accommodating and friendly service.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104666120264980535550/reviews
Kelly W,5,"Coffee is great here and the big breakfast is fantastic, especially the house made chorizo baked beans and hash brown. Nothing is frozen or made from a packet. Ordered eggs poached soft and got soft boiled eggs but the server fixed it asap no fuss which was really appreciated. Love the bowls of water they have for all the dogs and the prompt service. Good amount of outdoor seating if you bring your pup. Indoors icy fresh with fantastic air con if you prefer that.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117790449479557280250/reviews
M S,5,"A great find so close to our hotel. A tad bit late sharing this review, but a place we visited a couple of times during a visit.
We loved the freshly brewed coffee. Our absolute favorite is the deconstructed granola and yogurt.
Coffee was great too.
Our only issue was the tight spaces to sit. Not much space between the tables laid out and people would knock over stuff sitting and getting out.
Other than that, a great place specially for breakfast / brunch!!!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117558247025833086571/reviews
Joanna Gabriel,5,"Beautiful space with great service and truly delicious food! I had the chili chicken that was cooked perfectly and served with a spicy sauce, sweet potatoe nicely flavored, and bright fresh greens. It was truly delicious and the other plates I saw around were equally artistic in presentation and gourmet in flavor. I loved sitting by the windows and getting to look out on the greenery. There are outdoor seating options also. The cappuccino was rich and smooth. Everything done with great care, and served with genuine hospitality. My server Diana was welcoming and terrific. I was next to a regular who I could tell comes back because of the service he gets for his simple order. What a great atmosphere! I highly recommend this location!!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109807846443059956622/reviews
Sue,4,"One of my favourite cafes. Nice warm kale salad perfectly executed with soft fluffy egg and bread crumbs. Also had the fries for take away.
Service can be a bit better or more responsive
as there was not so many people at 9 am on a weekend.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109030078087160231223/reviews
