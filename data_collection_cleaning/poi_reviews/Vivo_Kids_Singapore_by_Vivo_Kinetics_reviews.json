The coaches are experts, fun, caring, and make it enjoyable for kids. The whole play time is full of fun and laughter while playing some serious football.\nAlso, a big shout out to the academy team who helped us out with our queries on many occasions. It was a breeze to connect with you.\nThank you Vivo Kids üôè",

And only as a giveaway winner, we had so much fun. Will definitely sign up for my daughter soon together with her brother, my 3 years old son. Its not only playing with Vivo kids, its about learning new things as well. Thank you VIVO KIDS!",

The activities were well thought out and captivates the attention of the kids. There is also good use of the various sports equipment. The venue is also very safe and comfortable for the young ones to have a good time.",

The great thing about this location is that it is sheltered, with natural ventilation, hence lessons are possible during rain or shine. Coaches Kai and Kai Bin are patient with the children, and yet have good control over the pace of the class. Our child has become more sociable and is exposed to different types of sports during the class. Highly recommend VivoKids for parents who wish to engage their children meaningfully.",
