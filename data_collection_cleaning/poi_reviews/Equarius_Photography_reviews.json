      "text": "It was a pleasure working with Equarius Photography for our mini pre-wedding shoot and wedding day recently. From the beginning, their team demonstrated professionalism, creativity, and exceptional attention to detail until the very end.\n\nFrom the pre-wedding shoot to just days before the actual day, they were open to our vision of how we hoped the photo- videos and SDEs would turn out, while also bouncing ideas and expectations off us. Given our packed wedding day schedule, the team arrived well in advance for our early call time. They took the time to understand our vision for the day and made sure every important moment was beautifully documented. Whether it was the quiet, intimate moments with our loved ones or the energetic fun shots with our bridal squad, Equarius Photography truly captured the essence of our wedding day.\n\nThe team was unobtrusive but always in the right place at the right time. They made us feel comfortable throughout the entire process, and their easygoing demeanor helped us relax and be ourselves. We particularly appreciated how they guided us while still allowing natural emotions to flow throughout the day. Despite our packed wedding day schedule, they managed to cover all the shots and created a beautiful, quirky, and touching SDE video.\n\nOverall, we couldn't have asked for a better experience with Equarius Photography. Their exceptional service, attention to detail, and ability to make us feel at ease on such an important day made them one of the highlights of our wedding. We highly recommend their services to anyone looking for a photo-video team that goes above and beyond to create quality memories that touch your heart.\nThank you, Equarius Photography! üíú",
