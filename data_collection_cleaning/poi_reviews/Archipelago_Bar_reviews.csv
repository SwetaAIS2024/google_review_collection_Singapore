Layar Jaring,4,"Had a cold draft beer here. The food menu is simple but looks delicious. I didn't order it as I was short of time. Because it's prepared fresh, you will need at least 20 min for cooking. Maybe next time. The seating is comfortable and you can overlook the tarmac and the planes. Nice place to chill while waiting for your flight.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104273519659810696266/reviews
Dion Horgan,1,"Very poor hygiene at this bar, brought a beer only to see bugs landing on the nozzle from which they pour the beer, asked staff to clean and a refund. The staff weren't really concerned about the problem, their excuse was they dont do the cleaning, and they were too busy chatting with their friends. Will never visit this place again!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109946687796045195315/reviews
Luke O'Malley,1,"51 dollars for this. Unbelievably rude staff, the food tastes like something I'd collect from the trash. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else. Don't waste your time here. Even for the little amount of good you get, you'll spend more time in the bathroom after wishing you'd listened to my advice.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107734379908200986385/reviews
Unni Pillai,2,"Archipelago, located in the recently renovated Terminal 2 of Changi Airport, offers a convenient yet limited dining experience. The restaurant provides a decent selection of beers, albeit pricey, starting at $20. However, the limited food menu and the indifferent attitude of the staff could use improvement. The service lacks warmth, and the menu would benefit greatly from more variety. Despite these shortcomings, given the sparse dining options in Terminal 2, Archipelago remains a necessary stop for travelers with no other choices. Will I visit again? Yes, out of necessity rather than preference.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117888251838728355835/reviews
Jason Kupka,2,"If you came here looking for beer from the establishment formerly known as ""Singapore's Craft Brewery"" you'll be overly disappointed.
If you're simply looking to wearily wash down your food with some of the general swill widely distributed by Asia Pacific Brewers, you may only be mildly disappointed.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118428085631154380946/reviews
