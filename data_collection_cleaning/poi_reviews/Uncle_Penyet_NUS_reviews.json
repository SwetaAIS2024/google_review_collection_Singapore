Definitely a solid fried chicken, though freshness of leaves is meh and tofu lacks some flavor.\nOverall decent meal for the price, but perhaps doesn't live up to its good old days?",

      "text": "My order when Iâ€™m there is the chicken wing rice. For just over four dollars, it is very value for money. The chicken wing is flavourful, with a slightly thicker crisp coating than normal. However, this gives it a nice crunch. This dish is served with curry rice.\n\nDo request for \"nasi lemak\" chili as it elevates the flavour profile of the chicken and cuts through the oiliness too.",
