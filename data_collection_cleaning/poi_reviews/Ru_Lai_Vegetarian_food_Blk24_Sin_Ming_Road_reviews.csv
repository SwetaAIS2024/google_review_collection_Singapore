Michelle Ler,5,"My husband and I simply love their laksa. It comes with full boiled egg and generous tou pok and zai er. The laksa gravy is different from the other vegetarian stores. No wonder their laksa is sold out before 10am.
We also like their carrot cake, soup noodles and hor fun. The bosses ensure the food is prepared well and delivery their best to serve every customer. I truly appreciate them doing this.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110832575475293521711/reviews

Bryan Lon,1,"2 eggs with rice for $3.60. Not much else to say. In fact I'm quite speechless. I know Singapore is expensive, but definitely not this expensive.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101869506055887544256/reviews

@24 Sin Ming Rd, #01-51, Singapore 571024

Rice with 3 dishes were SG$4.00
The leaflygreen vegetables were OK..
Curry vegetable was OK
The bitter gourd eggs was good.
The vinegar green chillies was good and the red paste chillies was hot and spicy but its sweetness was a bit overwhelming...
The brown rice 糙米饭 was served neither hot nor even warm... was quite disappointed that they did not managed to kept them hot or warm when serving... same goes to the dishes which were not warm at all...
Could not raised their credit higher as their overall were just average...",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116675375590051310522/reviews
