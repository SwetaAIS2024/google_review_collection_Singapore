Elizabeth Elisha Ms Kueh,5,"I like this place as I don't need to travel to town and I can experience a chilled and nice ambience too.

Their tapas was great, especially their self created cocktail that's very affordable and unique.

It's the perfect place to hangout! I've been back a few times!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116463728634826205226/reviews
Ashley Soo,5,"I recently visited this neighbourhood bar and was thoroughly impressed. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxed and chill, making it a perfect spot to unwind. The drinks are reasonably priced and consistently well-made for both cocktails and mocktails. It’s exactly what you’d hope for in a local hangout. Service is great and everyone is very attentive even when it gets busy. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a great, laid-back experience!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101794443918505357063/reviews

Xavier Nathan,5,"This place feels like a first date.... exciting, a little mysterious, and definitely something you’ll be thinking about later. The drinks? Smooth like the DJ’s set. The vibe? So good it almost convinced me I’m a better dancer than I am. If you’re looking for a spot to sip, mingle, and maybe meet your next bad decision, this is it. 11/10, would flirt with strangers here again. Would recommend to family and friends!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104754640312929168935/reviews
