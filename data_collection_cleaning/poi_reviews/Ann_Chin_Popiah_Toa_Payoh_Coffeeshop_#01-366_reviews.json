      "text": "üü®Ann Chin Popiah Toa Payoh Coffeeshop\n( Unit #01-366)\n‚ú≥Ô∏è Blk 111, Lorong 1 Toa Payoh\nSingapore 310111\n\nüü¶  The popiah skin is way too dry, and comes across like not too fresh, is brittle and not elastic. The filling is kind of tasty though.\n\nüü¶ For good quality popiah rolls, the popiah skin should be soft, moist and chewy. ‚ú≥Ô∏è Here at Ann Chin Toa Payoh, the skin is dry and hard.  ‚úîÔ∏è They need to do something about the popiah skin.\n\nüî¥ Maybe they didn't cover the pile of popiah skins with a damp towel?  üüß Maybe they should keep the stack of popiah skins in a steaming basket like what most hotel eateries does.\n\nüî∑Ô∏è My late Peranakan mum used to hold popiah parties and the popiah skins were placed in a traditional steaming basket to keep them soft and moist all the time. That's the way.\n\nüü¢ I can't say this is a good quality popiah roll. It is average at best.\n\nüçäüçäDated 8th Feb 2025 Sat / CNY 11th day",

It jus so near my house yet I can't eat it often but have to travel to Chinatown market to have it . The fillings there are more appropriate and tasty.",
