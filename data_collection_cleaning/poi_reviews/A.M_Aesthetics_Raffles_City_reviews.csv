Holy Olivia,5,"I‚Äôve been a loyal AM customer since they first opened at RC 4 years ago, and I‚Äôve always been impressed with their service and care. The staff - Queenie, Anne, Crystal, and Dr Teh - are professional and always go the extra mile. They supported me when I was preparing for my wedding, helping me to look and feel my best! Today, once again they went above and beyond resolving a communication issue swiftly and efficiently. Thank you! The management is truly fortunate to have fully dedicated and amazing team! Please give them a well-deserved raise! It would be even better if they could bring Queenie back to the RC team!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114359025737224547298/reviews
