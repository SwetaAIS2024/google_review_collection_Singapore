The facilities are obviously used and old, the hair dryer produces loud noise hence I didn't use it at all.  The service is quite ok, they have a 24 hrs front desk.\nNearby have a food court which is quite convenient. If you don't mind their carpet and room, you can try to stay for a night.",

There are plenty of nearby stores and eateries for breakfast and local food. The room was clean, comfortable, and affordable. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a convenient and budget-friendly place to stay in Singapore!",

The staff were not accommodating, appeared impatient, and seemed unwilling to answer my questions properly. This left me feeling undervalued as a customer.\n\nSecondly, the carpets were extremely dirty and poorly maintained. This is a separate issue from the room cleaning services. Regarding room tidiness, it is disappointing to note that cleaning and tidying up only happens once every two days. This is inadequate for maintaining cleanliness and comfort in the space.",

The hot water was surprisingly hot, which was a nice touch, and the air conditioning worked well. However, the carpet could use a deep cleaning, and the bed, while comfortable enough, wasn't particularly plush. Overall, it's a decent option for budget-conscious travelers seeking a basic, functional accommodation.",
