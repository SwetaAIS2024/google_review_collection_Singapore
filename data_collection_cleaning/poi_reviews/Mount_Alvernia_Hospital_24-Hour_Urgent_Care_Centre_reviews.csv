Joanne Chan,1,"The worst A&E service I had ever experienced. Nurses are not attentive nor compassionate. When we arrived at the A&E for admission as referred by our doctor-in-charge, we informed the reception nurse the doctor in charge name and we also informed our doctor that we had arrived. We arrived at 11am and still waiting when is 2.20pm, not admitted yet. Nurses were all looking at their computer behind the reception counter rather than attending to patients outside. There were many patients still waiting at the waiting area to be attended to.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104619650104127281558/reviews
Zhi Hao Tea,5,"I was a little anxious at first when I read previous negative reviews about Dr. Loo, but decided to give it a go anyway since I was already here. Dr. Loo came across as patient and detailed in his work. After taking medication my child‚Äôs issue was resolved. Nurses were helpful and friendly too. üëçüèªüëçüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108442398043867074698/reviews
Jessica,5,"Visited on a Wednesday night around 9.30pm due to persistent high fever from Tonsillitis. Waiting time was only around 30-45 minutes including seeing nurse and doctor. There was no crowd at that timing and the Urgent Care Center was peaceful.

Registration was quick and easy, just scan the QR code with your Singpass and the hospital can access to your details without having to produce a physical IC.

Nurse provided good service, took my BP and asked important questions to ensure she gathered as many information as possible before seeing doctor 5-10 minutes later.

Was seen by Dr Shaun Rama and he was really professional. He gave advice on when I should come back/where to go if symptoms do not subside by which day.

Personally, I feel that pharmacy and cashier should switch places as hospital should allow patients to check on the list of medications first before payment. However, on that day I was told to make a payment first before checking on the medications which I felt did not make sense.

Sure enough, I had 2 medicines which I didn‚Äôt want to take as I already have them at home (ibuprofen & famotidine) because I saw a GP that very same day in the morning. In the end, we had to go through the trouble to reverse the first payment and to charge a new amount again which felt unnecessary if we were allowed to check first.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101155769435742692907/reviews

Des Chan,2,"Was very good, affordable n excellent service few years back.  It started getting expensive with lots of extra charges, service still acceptable.
