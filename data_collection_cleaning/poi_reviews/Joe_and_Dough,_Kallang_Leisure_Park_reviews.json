The layout is spacious and there is when a window view.\nI‚Äôve a particular liking for the Chai Latte which tastes fantastic. It has just the right amount of spices and cinnamon, topped with some sugar. Barista, Shureen is lovely and attends to customers with a smile - which brightens up my day! üòä",

Cold, pre-made, airplane food type dishes (watery scrambled eggs, soggy vegetables, rubbery sausage) . When we complained and asked for refund, I was told by the staff ‚Äúit‚Äôs fresh, we just made it yesterday‚Äù. I had to explain to the young girl behind the counter that ‚Äúmade yesterday‚Äù is not fresh. They‚Äôre serving overnight cooked food and charging $17 for a plate for breakfast. Always wanted to try this place as it‚Äôs near my house, but I‚Äôm never going back again.",

But this morning I was lucky to enjoy a great double shot latte at Joe & Dough at Leisure Park Kallang. Not too milky. Strong rounded coffee flavour. And enough volume to enjoy a good cuppa. Thank you Shureen (barista). Great coffee.",
