Andrew Chan,1,"Most of the original members from Ebenezer chapel have already left, including the first pastor.
The original building fund that was contributed for a church building was used to buy an office building at Kampong Bahru, without AGM approval.
The results is the church renting premises for many years.

The current church does not sing any Baptist hymns like Onward Christian soldiers or Be thou my vision. It incorporates many church growth tactics, like singing hyped pop Christian songs, Alpha courses, family gatherings, and a pastor NOT from Baptist background.

Was the first church in Acts of the Apostles a Baptist church? Will you find any peace attending NLBC activities?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117403897192162061873/reviews
