Tried the specialty lo mai kai, Chee Cheong fun, har kao, siew mai, xiao long bao and HK style chee Cheong fun. Really bad except for the xiao long bao that’s edible but the skin is thick and hard. Filling tasted too porky.",

Nice savoury soup, springy noodles and the wanton is really good. We also ordered from RONG CHENG ROU GU CHA…peppery style bak kut teh, soft juicy meat, soup is really shiok and topping of soup is allowed. Enjoyed our yummy lunch and would to love to come back for other interesting choices.",
