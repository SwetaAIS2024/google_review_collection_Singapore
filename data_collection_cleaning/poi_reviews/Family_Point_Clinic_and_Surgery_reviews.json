Almost everytime we see any of the locum doctors, we have to either seek help elsewhere again or go back to see doctor yang again because the medicines given by the locum doctors don't work. For some reason, the locum docs seem to cost more too.",

My brother went there just to get his feet checked because it was swollen but ended up feeling sad after the visit. Dr Yang, is not professional and not friendly, i really don’t understand where all these good reviews come from. It is not nice to fat shame your patient especially when the came to your clinic a proper consultation.",
