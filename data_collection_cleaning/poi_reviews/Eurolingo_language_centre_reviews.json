Although the main focus of our lessons was to prepare me for language exams to study in Germany, Anja was always open to tailoring my lessons to focus on certain topics of interest to me, which made German learning a thoroughly enriching experience!",

We learn in a small group setting which is perfect for engagement and Maria does such an amazing job explaining the language, culture, and helping me with all my many questions.\n\nThere is a good balance of grammar, vocab, written/ reading exercises, speaking opportunities, and games.\n\nAttending this Spanish class with Maria and our lovely group has been a weekly highlight for me this year! Can't wait to continue.",

Anja takes care to create a light hearted and open environment where students are free to practice and laugh at their own mistakes.\n\nShe has over a decade of experience teaching German to both young learners and adults locally, and is extremely adaptable and tailors her classes to fit students of different demographics. I always appreciate the cultural nuances and little tidbits and fun facts she dispenses during class.",
