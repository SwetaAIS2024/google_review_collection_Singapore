      "text": "If you’re looking for a budget-friendly hotel that includes breakfast, this place might fit the bill. Just keep in mind a few things.\nFirst, the location is quite far from any MRT station, so you’ll likely need to rely on Grab to get around. The breakfast is very basic, which is understandable for a budget hotel. The room was okay overall, but the bed was too soft and made creaking noises, which affected sleep quality. What really stood out—in a negative way—was the front office service. The staff, particularly the Chinese man without glasses, came across as cold and dismissive. No name tags were worn, which might be for the best considering their lack of hospitality. I had an issue with the soap and shampoo being completely empty in my bathroom, so I approached one of the Chinese staff members at the front desk—the one wearing glasses, he acted like I didn’t exist. He wouldn’t make eye contact, barely responded, and completely shut down the conversation. It felt like I was talking to a wall.\n\nOverall, the poor hospitality completely overshadowed the hotel’s budget-friendly perks. Definitely not a place I’d return to.",

Therefore, it is really difficult to move around in here if your family has 3 people or more.\n\nThe service here are acceptable. Employees are quite friendly and can speak your local language. The facilities around the hotel are quite delightful if not really convenient for tourists to buy food or necessities.\n\nAs for the location, this hotel is comfortably placed in an open street for tourists to find or travel around. But not quite easy to find the hotel if you got lost because the outside looks like a normal coffee shop.",

Wifi is strong enough to be used downstairs outside. Tables, floors, even the drain holes are clean! Very little outdoor noises as the neighborhood seems to have a slow traffic rule for less noise. A wonderful stay for the family or... For a honeymoon. Yes, the rooms are secure and soundproof.",
