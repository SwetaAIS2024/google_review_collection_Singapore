Indoor or alfresco seating are well ventilated for your comfort.",

      "text": "Salmon salad was good. At $11.9, there were many salmon chunks. Nice place and had potential to do well, but sadly our experience was not great. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things.\n\nMany items were sold out when we were there at 8pm. Chicken was sold out, salmon was sold out, cod was not available… so we got the steak - please don’t get this… it was tough and dry & we spat half of it out.\n\nRed ruby could be colder and coconut cream was a bit too salty. Vanilla latte was way too sweet - more syrup than coffee taste. Lemongrass drink was less sweet, but still sweet.",
