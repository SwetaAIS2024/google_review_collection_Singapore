Phyll Y.,2,"Kaya toast and soft-boiled eggs were done well, but service was horrible. The male elderly staff making the drinks was adamant that I ordered teh o, arguing that he heard it himself. When I tried to clarify nicely, he refused to engage, obviously willing me to walk away. Very poor service attitude.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116766235154293681938/reviews
Irene Lim,2,"No choice, to come here for a quick meal.
Place is kinda dirty. Food is so so.
The cashier used her bare hands to put the bread into the toaster.
But Butter kaya bread is slightly better than expected.
The tray they used are not cleaned properly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105804445185126817371/reviews

H Wang,1,"The cashier is not listening the order.
I said take away they made dine in.
And all behind me have taken their food, and they are not aware I’m still there. They don’t check also.
Uncle making drink is super slow and reluctant.
After the cashier told him it’s take away, he pour the drink into the take away cup. And still didn’t put the egg into the container.
If they don’t want to work , plz go home.
Don’t waste customer time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116745264767862356084/reviews
laumu ni,1,"Very disappointed. I came today and didn’t see the short-haired girl. I heard from others that she no longer works here. Every time I came before, she was fun and made jokes. Today, there was a Malay girl instead, and she was relatively slow in her work. I won’t be coming back again.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105340265232688244866/reviews
