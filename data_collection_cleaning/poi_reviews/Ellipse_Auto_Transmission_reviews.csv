Christina Lee,5,"Had done all my car servicing and repair work with Ellipse Auto Transmission for the past 9 years and they never disappoint me.

Recently i went back again for my regular car servicing and the technician did a check on my car and reminded me that my car battery will need to be replaced soon.

At Ellipse Auto, you are always be assured that service is excellent, price is reasonable and more importantly, you will have a peace of mind when driving your car. Highly recommend!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100325478547961404404/reviews

Reza Ravari,5,I found this Autoshop to be very ethical in both their advice and pricing. They solved an issue which another shop caused to my car and was not willing to fix. I highly recommend them and a special shoutout to Alvin who helped me thru the issues. Will definitely rely on them in the future.
