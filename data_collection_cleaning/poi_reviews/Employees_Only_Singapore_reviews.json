Both were pretty decent. Drinks were OK as well. Service was very good, and atmosphere was quite chill, at least while we were there.",

      "text": "Love their What Side cocktail, burger and fries. Was there twice recently, first time was Wednesday ladies night with a female friend. The female service staff kept a lookout for us and came over to ask if we were ok a few times, esp when there was a group of folks that shared our table and was standing quite close to us 2 ladies. What Side tasted better the first time I ordered it. Love the vibe at 10+pm. At 7pm it's dining patrons. Vibe gets better at 9pm. Wonder why people don't party earlier. Easy to get Grab right outside at midnight.",

On my most recent visit, we were lucky to be assisted by Trisha, who was incredibly warm and accommodating. Despite the place being packed, she managed to get us a table and took care of us with a smile.\n\nService was top-notch. Highly recommend EO to anyone visiting Singapore who‚Äôs looking for a great night out!",

Went on Fourth of July accidentally (I‚Äôm American) and they had fun USA-themed drinks/dishes as well as decor and dress code (employees were wearing flip flops, wifebeaters, etc.) I thought their decoration was, at the time, very funny (see pictures). Unfortunately, considering current circumstances, they did not age well. Overall super fun experience ‚Äî would definitely visit again, especially for special events.",
