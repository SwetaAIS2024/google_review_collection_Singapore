Alexander Reinaldo,1,"Expensive stall, 1st meal of 2 meat, 1 vegie (long beans) for $6.9 and take away another meat of $3. Taste below standard and portion is small like other have mentioned. First and last and highly recommend to support other business, at least they handle customer nicer than them.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108446373348289716691/reviews
Ciwie Goh,2,"The stall serves small portions of the dish, the taste was normal. I ordered two vegetable dishes and one meat dish, which cost $4 in total. It's not inexpensive compared to another stall offering the same dishes but with larger portions.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100284534113160934626/reviews
