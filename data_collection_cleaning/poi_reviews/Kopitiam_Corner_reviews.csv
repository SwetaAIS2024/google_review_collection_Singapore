Raymond Y,3,"Regarding the ccp stall, I think the workers simply charge their customers.  2.50 for a small portion of pork with tofu in black sauce, supposedly a premium dish.Granted their stall has the tastiest ccp in Simei but akin to daylight robbery.  Must ask which ones are premium before I point my stupid fingers next time I buy because the dish wasn't anything special. But I'll be going again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100221174593379185002/reviews
Alex Goh,3,"Pacific Mixed Rice stall typically overcharges for the veg options (charging as meat or even premium dish). it's unlike the price you can get for ""economical mixed rice"" at other coffee shops. their staff are rude and show attitude. $2.70 member mixed rice is limited to typically less than 5 options to choose from.

you're better off patronising other stalls that have better food value and service.
Western, Roasted Delight, Fried Rice, Seafood Soup, Ban Mee are all wonderful alternatives for a pleasant meal.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105085588955128400836/reviews
Eugene Tay,3,"Kopitam @248 Simei Street 3 #01-136, Singapore 520248

- Revamp and a lot of new stalls

- Hwa Heng Beef Noodle
Awesome broth,  dry version also good . Beef slices tender , tendons soft .

- Sitting area outside renovated BUT the area is always messy and dirty in the morning and early afternoon. The person in charge of cleaning not really don't his part tho.

- Will update more , when I try out other items there.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115351041936386374822/reviews
Zi Xuan,2,"Most of food there are good - Ban Mian, Roasted, Western and the new Korean x Fish soup stalls. Mixed economy rice can be really expensive and tbh the taste is not even that fantastic to charge such a premium.

Service from the drink stall is terrible. Unfriendly auntie and uncle who cannot explain the free coffee voucher patiently. Its almost like they are mocking customers over it.

There are plenty of seats most of the time but its generally hot and noisy.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110620387368246696359/reviews
S YH,3,"Standards among stores are different.  Mostly good except drink store, which staff seem too tired and cant  talk ""politely"" or speechless responds (cant tell what they mean) or let down the drink heavily with my tea spilled off (not forgetting I paid for it and is not they pay). Wonder how will they feel when they are treated the same way and certainly give very bad examples to young people who join in the service crew????

Wonder why kopitiam continue to encourage smoking areas that affects majority of customer who does not smoke???? The smell covers not only  the whole areas of kopitiam but beyond",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117469461470121371374/reviews
