MingYu Liang Lenn,5,"Went there for the 4-6pm Saturday vocal class on the 3rd floor music room anchored by pastor Angkasa where we were taught to sing famous mandarin secular songs.

I like the pastors of the English, mandarin and Tamil services. Personally, I've attended all of them and found them pleasing and rife with the presence of the HOLY spirit. The congregation members are also open for conversation.

I was invited back for the Friday 5.30-7pm practice for spiritual songs. Hope I can make it!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101009988414239525702/reviews
