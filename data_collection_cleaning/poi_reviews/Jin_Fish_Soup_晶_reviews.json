      "text": "First time trying this stall and i regret my choice. I ordered fried fish soup with milk and the soup is blend. Not tasty and no taste of milk. To be fair, the fish and ingredient is ok but imo the most important component of a fish soup is the soup. I have check if the shop indicate any healthy choice signs that states less salt less everything but no. While writing this review, i seen other good and bad comments too, and 1 user commented the inconsistency. I guess im the unfortunate one today that get the not good version. Wont try again.",
