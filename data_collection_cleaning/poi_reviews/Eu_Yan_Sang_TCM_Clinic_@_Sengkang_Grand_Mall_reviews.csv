Nicole Liang,5,"Visited EYS TCM clinic for a sprained ankle injury. Was treated by Dr Lo Man Ping, she was patient and effective. Months of swelling for an old ankle injury went down almost immediately following my acupuncture session. She made the consult feel comfortable and constantly checked in while I had my treatment.

Special mention to receptionist Ms Jenny who was so kind and detailed.

Best clinic I have ever went to, staff truly care about their patients.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111533984183912366443/reviews
