ReVoz 8,5,"Very satisfied with King and team. Recommending our family which louhei to order during CNY and always preparing tasty food for both of my kids.

Order is always prompt and seamless.
We come here weekly because our kids are addicted to the tasty fried rice that King whips up.

Mins Ismadi Sani,1,"I ordered from this stall once, but the staff was doing all sorts of things, except for cooking. I preferred to order from Hougang Mall, but unfortunately, it closed down.

Today, again, I ordered from this store. And again, staff was busy but not cooking.

Took some time for my food to be prepared. Should have ordered from Stuff'd.

After I posted this feedback, I read other reviews. They are quite similar, very slow service. There were responses, even. Seems like ""value your feedback"" is just a template term. No improvement has been done.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116880847652632566459/reviews
sucy oktari,5,I tried their Raya Exclusive Satay Chicken Fried Rice and love it! So flavourful and delicious with generous portions. I definitely recommend this to let you try with friends and family before this 24 April. Do order this limited menu.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105495312435948917038/reviews
