      "text": "went on Monday, 12 August. i think all was good until the Soju tower came to the room. To be honest, really quite disappointing. firstly, it didn‚Äôt taste like it was alcoholic. it was more like yakult. felt no kick at all even at the end. secondly, the tower was at least 50% ice. 2 litres? didn‚Äôt look like it. After 2 hours, the ice was still almost at 30%. I would‚Äôve thought the ice would be separated from the beverage so that it wouldn‚Äôt dilute it. When i asked the staff about it, he says it‚Äôs not supposed to be separated. i felt scammed.\n\nthat said, the food was not bad. the sound system was good. i really hated the damn lights though. I switch it off, but after EVERY SINGLE SONG, at the NEXT SONG it COMES BACK ON! Please programme it such that it doesn‚Äôt come back on each time. It is really very frustrating and annoying!\n\nI had higher expectations for HaveFun.",
