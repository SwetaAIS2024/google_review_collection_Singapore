      "text": "+ Great taste. Portion not that big though.\n\n+ The stall sells quite a variety of dishes including donburi, udon, Japanese curry, Ishiyaki (fried rice).\n\n- Prices are reasonable.\n\n+ Located in quiet hidden corner of the estate. Less hot and expensive compared to the other nearby coffeeshop at 209B Clementi Ave 6.\n\n+ Ample sheltered MSCP parking next door.\n\n- Few other stall options in this coffeeshop if your companions want to try something else.",
