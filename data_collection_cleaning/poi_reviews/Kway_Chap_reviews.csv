Tian Min Teong,4,"Have been eating this kway chap for years. In terms of quality and value its 4 out of 5. In times of high living cost, they are still trying to maintain a set meal at $5.80 is not easy. My meal with an additional soft and fresh bowl of kway cost a total of $6.80 which can satisfy 2 small eater. For single big eater, this is very satisfying until i need to take 5 mins of rest before leaving. I would recommend this stall and their other menu available. They operate long hours from morning till 9pm.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107978823756746825453/reviews

Joseph Tan,3,"Unfortunately, this is the only kway chap option within the vicinity that I live. Fortunately however, it wasn't bad but rather acceptable and priced reasonably.
