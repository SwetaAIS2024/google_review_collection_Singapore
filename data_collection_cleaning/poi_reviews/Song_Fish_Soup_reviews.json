      "text": "If you’re in Clementi and craving a comforting bowl of fish soup, Song Fish Soup is a must-visit. Their sliced fish bee hoon is a standout—firm, fresh fish slices served in a light, subtly sweet broth. The addition of bitter gourd and cabbage adds a nice crunch and balances the flavors well. For something richer, the fried fish bee hoon in milky broth is equally satisfying, with crispy fish pieces that soak up the creamy soup beautifully. Don’t forget to try their unique chili sauce with fermented bean curd—it adds a delightful umami kick. The stall has earned a Michelin Bib Gourmand, and it’s easy to see why. Be prepared for a queue, but it’s well worth the wait!",

The soup had bitter gourd which gave a nice firm texture to each bite. The noodles were firm and tasty. While the fried fish was fleshy and the batter a little crispy. Overall very enjoyable and worth the wait.",
