Great location to pull up a chair, chat with friends, meet new people and quench your thirst, and settle your hunger. All this while listening to great tunes from the resident DJs they have on rotation.\n\nStaff are always friendly, helpful and talkative.",

      "text": "[Pet-Friendly Drinking Hole Feature] Bayside Drinks & Eats, Marina Bay\n\nMarina Bay might be a popular place to bring your dog for a walk, but pet-friendly eateries around the area are few and far between, despite many of them having an outdoor seating.\n\nThanks to a kind comment on Facebook, we stumbled across this drinking hole + snack place that is more than welcoming to Chewie and sheltered us during a tiring walk around the bay area.\n\nThe place serves mainly alcohol with small bites, and the seating arrangement consists mainly of high chairs, but they were friendly to dogs and made us feel at home. The price is also quite affordable.\n\nWe enjoyed our time here and they're worth a visit if you're taking an evening stroll with your dog around the area!",

Staffs are extremely friendly and fun. Good thing that they also allowed you to choose your music to play by choosing your selection from the playlist at the bar. Most of the time they will close late so this is a good place for your one last drink for the road. Cheers !!!!",
