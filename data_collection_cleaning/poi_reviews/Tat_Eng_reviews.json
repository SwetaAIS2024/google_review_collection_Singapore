      "text": "I came here on a sat late morning. Rude and horrible staff for this outlet. Their kaki Bukit outlet is much more professional. This outlet doesn’t really welcome walk in customers. There is No distinct line to queue up, you probably need 30mins to purchase just a pack of screws. The cashiers don’t help out the operational staff even if there is a long queue out there.\n\nCalled a nearby speciality screw shop (Transin Hardware) at Teck park II, just 5mins away from this horrible store. They pick up the call within 5 rings, advised me on their closing hours is near and asked for my order. I did not give my name nor number but I assure them I was just 5mins away and I’m on my way if they have what I want.\n\nWhen I reached there, there was a clear line of queue which i queued 5mins for. 3 helpers and the boss and was attending to us. Eagerly helping out. When it was my turn, the items are already prepared, I pointed to it. I paid and I left. Speed is the essence.",

      "text": "Sell a wide range of screws but horrible attitude and service. Can’t even change a pack of screws unopened. Was told by the very rude lady behind the counter to see a person “outside”. Waited for the guy outside and was told to look for the lady behind the counter. Terribly untrained personnel. Will avoid if possible. This is what happens when businesses become too rich.",
