Kate Chen,4,Lai Kee Pau and Siew Mai is average. Nothing to rave about. It does cost a bit more than average. Service is so so.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110374417271152731015/reviews
Eunice Hannah Lim,4,"The dim sum is nice, custard bun was filled with a lot of custard and could burst overflowing ðŸ™‚ Hargao was nice ðŸ¥Ÿ we also ordered chicken glutinous rice and siew mai.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105250079964786451078/reviews
Hei Tan,1,"Went there for breakfast, ordered 1 law mai kai, 1 char siew pau and 4 siew mai. The server dropped the law mai kai on the counter top near the cash register while serving a customer in front of me. It was put aside, when I ordered, that law mai kai was given to me. When we asked for a new one, the old aunty who is collecting payment lied saying itâ€™s a new one.. she over charged me by $1.10. Total should be $7 but was charged $8.10. Food is so so and  the honesty of the staff is questionable.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118199976826751393357/reviews

Ru Xue Sim,2,"Sad to say I wonâ€™t be coming back here again, not even if i was craving dim sum.

Most of the dishes were cold (not literally, but comparatively), apart from the porridge.

Fried items were stale.

Itâ€™s mediocre at best :(

Only good one was the custard buns.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111653170468485062948/reviews
