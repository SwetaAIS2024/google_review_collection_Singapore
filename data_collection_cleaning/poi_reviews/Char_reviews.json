All were good.\n\nOnly thing is it's in an old shophouse and they need to open the main door to ventilate which makes the place warm, other than that, all good!",

But everything else was fabulous and definitely worth a visit!\n\nThe servers were also incredibly warm and helpful!\n\nIt was a lovely bustling place so be sure to make a reservation!",

Their roast pork used to have a very nice hint of rosemary, but not anymore. Would’ve been better if the eggplant casserole is less salty. The tornado butter egg prawns is rich and flavorful. Totally worth the price. Service staff are attentive and helpful. Will visit again to try other dishes.",
