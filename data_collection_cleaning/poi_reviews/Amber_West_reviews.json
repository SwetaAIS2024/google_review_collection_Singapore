      "text": "First visit to Amber West for lunch. Located within the ITE college West campus in Choa Chu Kang, it's a 'fine-dining' restaurant where students are trained and supervised by mentors by their side. They had just revamped their set lunch menu at the start of the new term. They offer a 2-course meal at $18 and a 3-course meal at $20 which comes with an appetizer (soup or salad), Mocktail, Main Course, Tea/Coffee and Dessert. It is certainly not the best of quality given the affordable cost but it's gratifying seeing the students giving their best trying to serve the customers. Well done üëçüèæüòä",

The  crackers are free flow, dessert is nice and hot chocolate is a hidden menu! Would come back again to try the western menu. :)",

According to the staff, they switch between the WESTERN and the ASIAN menus between holidays. This is even stated on the menu (which you can find online) when the menu is in effect.\n\nFurthermore, I did feel like I was in a formal restaurant, so I had to make myself presentable.",
