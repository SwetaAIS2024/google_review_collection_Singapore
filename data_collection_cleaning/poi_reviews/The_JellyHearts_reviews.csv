Magdalene Lam,5,"Ordered a jewel heart jelly cake very last minute a day before and staff Ron Karlo took in my order and arranged for next day delivery. Though there was a slight hiccup over delivery timing on a Sunday to outlet, it was resolved and Ron assured me he would try his best to see I receive at the timing I needed. Thankful for going extra mile to fulfill the order. Everyone love the jelly fruits at my family birthday celebration!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104519980080453514763/reviews
