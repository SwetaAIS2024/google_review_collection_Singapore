From the jetty, you can also see the view of the cliffs/forests/rocky beaches of labrador park.\n\nA stroll along the jetty will show you how popular this place is as a fishing spot. On the weekends, it is very common to see the fishing enthusiasts dotted around the jetty with their fishing gear, tackle box and even cooler boxes to store their catches from late afternoons all the way to the wee hours of the morning.\n\nThis is a good place to drop by for sea breeze and sunset view.",

Nice to look into their styrofoam boxes and pails to see what has been caught. Families, couples, exercising people - all love this open jetty.",
