Tk Sim,5,"Nice museum on the heritage of Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and the medical profession in Singapore, housed in the historic Bowyer Block.

Fully air-conditioned with two levels to explore - the storyboards, artefacts and wax figures (on level 2) make it a nice self-guided experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104162819671900610659/reviews
Viv薇薇安,3,"The SGH museum in Singapore offers a glimpse into the world of surgical tools. While the display of the tools is interesting, unfortunately, there is a lack of information about how these tools are used. The museum would greatly benefit from providing more context and explanations to enhance the visitor's understanding. Overall, it is a small museum that could be improved with better interpretation and educational materials.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113019870660151627817/reviews

Anna,4,We saw the building after having lunch at SGH and decided to go in. A quaint 2-storey mini museum about the history of SGH. I loved looking at the old surgical tools used back then. 4/5 stars because the mannequin at the stairs scared me as I was walking up lol.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100560013437720971308/reviews
