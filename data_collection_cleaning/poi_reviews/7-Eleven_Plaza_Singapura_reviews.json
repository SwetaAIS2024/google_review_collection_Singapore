Located near Taxi Stand A16, it's at the back side of the Plaza Singapura mall, near the carpark entrance. If you have the time and energy, visiting the mall's supermarket could provide you with a much better experience.\n\nThat said, there's a Singapore Pools in here if anyone needs to buy 4D / Toto / Horse Betting.",
