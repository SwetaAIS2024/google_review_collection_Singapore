It is not air conditioned, but even though we were there for lunch, it was not too warm. Plenty of fans kept the place breezy, and perhaps because it is set among a lot of greenery, it was comfortable. The food and coffee was good too. The prawn pasta was delicious and reasonably priced.",

The vibe is chill and welcoming, making it a great place to relax.\n\nFood-wise, prices are slightly on the higher side, but the quality definitely makes up for it. Everything I tried was fresh, well-prepared, and delicious. The All Day Hungry Breakfast is a must-try—hearty, flavorful, and super satisfying.\n\nThat said, transport-wise it’s not the most convenient place to get to, especially if you’re not driving. But if you don’t mind the journey, it’s worth the visit. (This was actually my 4th visit!)",

They have red and white wine but limited selection. Whisky and cocktail are available. You can bring your own liquor and pay $20++ for corkage, but if you spend more than $100, the corkage will be waived. Live performance only on Friday and Saturday. Quite a remote place though. Better if you drive or go with friend that drive.",

There's live band for those who like it - may be a tad too loud when you want to have a conversation with your friend. Overall we enjoyed a nice Friday evening here.",
