Alan Tang,5,"Wow! This Mee Soto is superbly delicious. The soup was brewed with various condiments and spices, a little peppery. The $4.50 serving with shredded chicken was simply delicious.

I added chicken spare parts (gizzards) to my bowl - for additional $2. The innards were tender and chewy. Very good too.

No wonder there’s a rather long queue.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118416171152567325758/reviews
Mohamad Nazli,3,"I bought a mee soto take away around 5 plus pm. But I had a shock, there was too many oil in the gravy. The oil is clearly visible it’s like eating oil together with the gravy. Hope they can do better than this.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114969577230021496628/reviews
MNG,4,"Seemed like a deviation from early years which you taste the chicken bone and spices. Now its broth is rich and well spiced, almost heavy handed.

Chicken was shredded too fine to enjoy.

Has it lost its mojo?",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
khamdan mahamud,5,"**Mee Rebus**: The star of Warong Pak Sapari is undoubtedly their Mee Rebus. The thick, luscious gravy, made from a blend of spices, potatoes, and dried shrimp, coats the noodles beautifully. Each bite is a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, making it an absolute must-try.

The stall's dedication to preserving traditional recipes is evident in every bowl they serve. The flavors are bold and authentic, and the generous portions ensure you'll leave with a satisfied belly. Warong Pak Sapari truly embodies the essence of Malay comfort food.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115842425139313221725/reviews
