      "text": "I was looking for a white rainbow cake without icing, and came across this one. Since it was close to my house, it was delivered free of charge, and although the size was large, the price was reasonable. After ordering, I decorated it with Pikachu, my daughter‚Äôs birthday theme and the design I wanted was completed. The cake was more delicious than expected! It wasn‚Äòt too sweet or too greasy, and everyone, both children and adults, said it was very delicious and asked where we had ordered it. I highly recommend this. Delivery was made early and all response was very friendly. awesome!! üëçüèªüéÇ",

      "text": "This is my fav cafe in this hood (the Eunos-Still Road-Changi Road-Joo Chiat Complex area).\n\nReasons why:\n\n(1) Great location: A short 5 min walk from Eunos MRT Station (Green Line) & Parc Esta Condo.\n\n(2) Delicious & innovative food and bakes prepared with lots of heart:\n\nThe owners do not cut corners when it comes to their bakes & food. Everything is made from scratch.\n\nLove that they constantly add new offerings too: - the heavenly Eggy Seoul is a must-try for fellow eggdicts like me ü•ö\n- their German Malt Sourdough Breads are super yummy\n- new & delicious flavours of Cakes üç∞ their latest innovation, the Earl Grey Citrus really hits the right notes üòã\n- the newly launched Gula Melaka Meringue Cookies really melt in your mouth I kid you not!\n\n(3) Laid back & unpretentious atmosphere:\n\nIt‚Äôs a small cafe & that‚Äôs where its charm lies. The high wooden table inside sits 4 comfortably while the 2 al fresco tables outside sits 4-6 pax.\n\n(4) Excellent service:\nAlways with a smile and a chat, the owners make you feel most welcomed.\n\n(5) Great coffee:\nA cafe worth its salt better have good coffee. I‚Äôm a latte fan and their delish latte comes in a big cup and very reasonably priced.\n\nIt‚Äôs no wonder I love going to Baker‚Äôs 13 to chill & have a great cuppa ‚òïÔ∏è",

      "text": "We stumbled across Colin and Christy's shop about three years ago when looking for somewhere to stop for a coffee. We tried the cake and have since bought a cake from Bakers 13 for every occasion since! The quality (taste) of the cakes are outstanding every time (carrot cake my personal favourite). Most recently we opted for a 3D cake for our daughter's birthday and they excelled themselves yet again with this handmade masterpiece! She loved her 'baa baa cake' too. Worth every penny.",

      "text": "I have had the pleasure of being a long term customer of Bakers13, and I must say, their commitment to quality ingredients and attention to detail truly stands out. The in-house sourdough bread sold and used in their sandwiches has the perfect texture and flavour. Each bite is a testament to the skill and dedication of the bakers. Their custom cakes have been showpieces at many of our parties (not to mention our family and friends‚Äô). One thing evident is that they take pride in sourcing the finest ingredients and crafting their offerings with precision. Bakers13 has elevated the art of baking to a whole new level, making it a must-visit destination for anyone who appreciates exceptional bakes and sandwiches.",
