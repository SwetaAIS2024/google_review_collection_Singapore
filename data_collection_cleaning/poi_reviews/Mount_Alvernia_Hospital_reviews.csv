Joanne Tey,5,"Had a great experience giving birth at Mount Alvernia Hospital. The nurses were attentive, and highly responsive, ensuring that I felt supported and cared for throughout my stay.

My obstetrician, Dr. Adelina Wong, was instrumental in guiding me through my pregnancy and labor. Her reassuring demeanor, and professionalism provided immense comfort during this journey.

Dr. Yvonne Lim as my anaesthetist during my C-section. Her expertise made the epidural administration nearly painless, and her calming presence throughout the procedure made me feel safe and at ease.

Deeply thankful to the entire team at Mount Alvernia Hospital üôèüèªüíó",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111453079327704310930/reviews
Sri Letchimi,5,"I was admitted in Mt Alvernia for a surgery on the eve of Good Friday. Despite being the long weekend holiday period, all the doctors and nurses took great care of me. Even the doctors in the operating theatre ensured that i was going to be well taken care before i went under GA. Nurse Gayatri from St Raphael Ward/8014 took great care of me. I had to frequently use the washroom and she patiently held me and brought me to the washroom and back to my bed multiple times and never once showed any sight of annoyance. She made sure to check on me to see if im fine before her shift ended and came back to check on me when her shift started. I am very grateful to Nurse Gayatri and the team at Mt Alvernia for providing such excellent service. Thank you and keep up the great service!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115175608474071767205/reviews

Christopher Chiong,1,"Very unprofessional service provided by this Private Hospital.. Red flag!

From my personal experience during my admission, I saw they engaged intern doctor or nurse to poke on my hand for an IV drip and yet can't find my veins which causing bruises for 1 week plus (FYI, my hands are full of veins as I am lean body type)..Before that, the senior nurse decided to needle poke my left hand (I am right-handed) but the ""intern' said can't find vein then proceed to my right-hand w/o asking my permission and link to story above.. After seeing failure, the senior nurse decided to poke my left-hand near the thumb area and successfully done. I mean what the hell are they doing?

I can said paying premium price to get subpar services from Private Hospital. They don't even show me the medical bill incurred upon discharge as promised by the nurse during my registration. Are they trying to amend the bill and anyhow claim from insurance companies? (I got both company and private insurance)

I am extremely disappointed with this hospital and I somehow understood why there are lots of bad reviews for this hospital for a reason. If got Zero star I definitely will rate it.

The management of the hospital doesn't even care on the feedback to them and do nothing about it.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115386361191852268558/reviews
