N. Gan,4,"I took a leisurely walk from Outram MRT Exit 8 to Pearl's Hill City Park and was struck by how serene the place feltâ€”completely removed from the bustle of the city. All I could hear was the gentle chirping of birds, creating a peaceful atmosphere. There are multiple paths and stairways leading up the hill, and I chose the one that led to the reservoir. It was fenced off, with a sign prohibiting photography and videography. The reservoir was surrounded by thick walls reminiscent of a castle. At the top, the only residential building was One Pearl Bank, an impressive piece of architecture perched on the hill. If not for the distant roar of thunderclouds, I would have stayed a while longer to enjoy the tranquility.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111536004756755931697/reviews
Forest BK,3,"On top of Pearl's Hill City Park is a reservior that hold our water from Johor. Pearl's Hill City Park is right in the centre of Chinatown. But it is relatively unknown to many.
The Park is serene with many large natured trees providing much needed shade.
Up here, you can have panoramic views of the Chinatown area.
If you haven't been here before, come once, at least, to enjoy this City Park.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
The Travel Hunter,3,"Pearl's Hill Park is a tranquil oasis in the heart of Singapore. This 9-hectare park features a scenic pond, walking trails, and a variety of flora and fauna. Visitors can enjoy a peaceful stroll, have a picnic, or simply sit and relax amidst nature. The park's proximity to the city center makes it an ideal escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life. A hidden gem worth discovering for nature lovers and those seeking serenity.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112702441126152817912/reviews
John a,4,"Nice park which, while on the top of the hill and seemingly visible from all the neighborhoods around, remains a bit hidden, natural and quiet. Walking paths circle the summit which is capped by a protected water catchment with thick stone walls built with hints of the style of castles. Similar in this way to the catchment at the summit in Fort Canning Park. A small pond has sitting areas, nice views of Chinatown, the CBD and more follow you on the paths as you hike.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115322239165769116221/reviews
