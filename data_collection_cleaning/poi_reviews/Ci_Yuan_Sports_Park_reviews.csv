Gecko Chua,4,"It is a Park with many tall trees and man make shelters and playgrounds for children, young and elderly people to do their morning exercises. The tall trees provided good shades especially when the weather is hot. There are also exercise equipments provided at the park.
There are also activities like dancing and tai chi every weekends at the big open hall in the park...",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102735410756160124167/reviews
Ant Tan (Ant),5,"Serene and fresh air lingers here in this neighbourhood park nested at Hougang Ave 8/Hougang St 92. The park links from main junction of St 92 (a road with two way street) with HDBs and a condominium while the park is at the middle of Ave 8 hence the two road name are mentioned. There’s children playground, street soccer cage, jogging/running track, fitness bars, picnic and seatings around. It’s also walking distance to Ci Yuan community centre/hawker centre.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116001171041763971352/reviews
Monsieur Snow,5,"Mini park with some amenities like exercise equipment. There is a running track but it doesn't seem to be continuous (gets cut off somewhere). Or maybe it's just me. There's a huge pavilion in the middle for gathering and not sure what purpose. Events maybe?
Still, I wouldn't call this a park given the size. But with what's around the area (nothing much to be honest), a great place for exercise!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102118777920337503499/reviews
Arthur Toh,5,A nice park to do my brisk walk every morning. Can't help but notice that even our neighbourhood parks are infiltrated by angmos. What I don't like is many people walk their dogs and some don't pick up the poop of their pets. And a group of ah peks walk here often but talk & block the damn path  so often. Other than that it's a nice park for a walk.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112060849669491496204/reviews
