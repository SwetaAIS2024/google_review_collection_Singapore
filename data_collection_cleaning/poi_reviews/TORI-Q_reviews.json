      "text": "We ordered a variety of different yakitori which included very delicious barbecue sticks of chicken ball, pork, pork and asparagus, spicy chicken karage, and chicken with green pepper. These were paired with a rice set A. The portions served were quite filling and very much worth the price. The serving of the dishes was quite good too, very organised and good looking. The rice served together with the meats was very well cooked and delicious especially with their addictive brown sauce. The location of this Tori-Q stall is very convenient to due it being in a shopping centre Plaza Singapura and in close proximity to the entrance to the MRT station.",
