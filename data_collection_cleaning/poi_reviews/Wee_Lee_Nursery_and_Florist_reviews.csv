Mulya Karmadi,5,"Love this place. You need to drive in to visit this nursery. Prices are so reasonable compared to those at Punggol Nursery. They let you roam around and very friendly to answer your queries. They even gave discounts when I try to bargain. Will drop by again for more Musa plants. Thumbs up to the worker there, very helpful.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101233253700956684488/reviews

Athena M,5,"Had the most wonderful experience shopping for plants here. This nursery is such a hidden gem. Plants all look healthy and beautiful, and there was a much bigger variety than we expected before going. Their selection of pots is small but well curated. And service is exceptional! The aunty and the other workers were so friendly, kind, helpful and informative, you can tell that they’re really passionate about gardening. Just happy to talk to us about plants. Not pushy, no expectations on us to buy after asking questions. And we asked many questions. We stayed till a bit after closing and they didn’t chase us out. Definitely pay this place a visit if you’re in the area, but you should drive in because getting there on foot may be difficult.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103232186648182903163/reviews

Nic2 Too,5,"We had previously bought plants from other nurseries and online, but we didn’t receive much guidance on how to care for them. Despite searching online for advice on how to save our dying plants, we had little success. After our plants died, we came across Wee Lee Nursery and decided to give it a try. Sam was incredibly helpful, providing clear guidance on how to care for our plants, while considering our specific environment. Although our purchase was small, he was very patient and took the time to explain the science behind keeping plants healthy. We were really impressed by his knowledge and will definitely follow his advice. We’ll certainly return to Wee Lee Nursery for our next plant purchase.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110841425137111943651/reviews
