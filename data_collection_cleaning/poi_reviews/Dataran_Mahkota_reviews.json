      "text": "I had a wonderful experience visiting... This beautifully landscaped public square is a perfect place to unwind and enjoy some fresh air. The park offers a peaceful atmosphere with well-maintained gardens, fountains, and wide open spaces. It’s great for a leisurely stroll, a family picnic, or simply to relax while enjoying the scenic views.\n\nThe surroundings are very clean, and the open spaces make it easy to enjoy the outdoors. The large, iconic Mahkota (crown) sculpture in the center is a nice touch and adds a cultural element to the area. The park also has a few benches, which are perfect for taking a break and people-watching.\n\nDataran Mahkota is a great spot for photography, and its central location makes it easily accessible for locals and tourists alike. It’s not too crowded, so it’s a calm retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. Whether you’re visiting for a short while or planning a longer stay, Dataran Mahkota is a lovely place to relax and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. Highly recommended!",

      "text": "Love the green environment, a lot of tree and flower and grass, also the walking path, bike ride path,  special signsboard, the dataran is wide with nice decorate, my bus stop at the terminal ,from the terminal to the dataran is not too long ,a new place that encourage healthy life style , the path is well build,  running activity , events always suitable to be here. Nice view , a lot of state government offices is here. Toilet is 3 star rate , not seriously dirty, enough in quantity. There is also somewhere to buy food and drinks but it is quite expensive gain also a 3 star rate. Not many options that provided for food and drinks is make me disappointed. A very beautiful mosque also build in this place which allow all Muslims to pray and release stress by looking to the green view.one more thing is the road are not wide but still enough for now situation.",
