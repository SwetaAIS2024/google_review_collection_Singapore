It is a peaceful and pleasant place to pray, meditate and relax.\n\nThis is a place of worship, so do exercise some common sense to be dressed appropriately.\n\nPS: It is absolutely disappointing to read about earlier reviews of \"bad service\" and \"poor attitude\" because from my short conversations with people here, most are volunteers, and they are doing it out of kindness and good intentions. Shame on you and your self-entitled thinking. Hope you will be guided back to the path of forgiveness and respect.",

      "text": "I recently visited this serene Buddhist temple and had a truly enchanting experience. The atmosphere was quiet and peaceful, with soothing music playing in the background and the sweet fragrance of agarbathi filling the air. One other thing that caught my attention was the breathtaking view of the sunset, perfectly framed below the MRT line. It was a truly splendid sight to behold. If you're looking for a place to unwind and connect with your inner self, I highly recommend visiting this temple. The tranquil ambiance and beautiful views make it an ideal spot for reflection and contemplation.",

      "text": "This temple is very different from other Buddhist temples in sg. One key thing is that it doesn't seem to affiliate or mix with Chinese or Thai folklore. Do note that they do have a Brahma statue here though, which already isn't Buddhist.\nHowever from its extended opening hours to the peaceful atmosphere, you can tell this place is much better. Their toilets at the back are also free for public, unlike many temples. This temple is nearly empty all the time except for Vesak celebration and during Seventh month ghost festives. Expect huge crowds during then. One inconvenient thing is there is no sheltered walkway and the path outside from the nearest bus stop is full of dents, collecting rainwater more often than not. There is a carpark to its right but you'll still have to walk out with an umbrella. Also, to its left heavy construction seems to be always for years which might be a reason why it's not as popular.",
