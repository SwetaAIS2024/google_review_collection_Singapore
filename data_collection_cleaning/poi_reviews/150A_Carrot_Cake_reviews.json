So for easier reference, they are located opposite the Yang Ming seafood.\nAm very happy to see younger owners at the stall, and very polite and overall service level is very good. They even have preorder options and you can call to place the orders.\nFood wise, the black carrot cake was good and not overly sweet which I read from other reviews. It is good and will come back for their carrot cake again. Keep up the good work!",

I‚Äôm a back carrot cake lover and this guy delivers it all. Even when packed, the aroma spills out like a ripen goodness of a durian. The taste hits the post all over and all over again with every mini plastic fork-full. Bib gourmand should find them as a new entrant in their annual report on whose who of great hawker food. Simply the best üëçüëçüëç.",

The carrot cake was on the sweeter note side (the way I like them), it was moist and every piece was well coated with the dark sauce. I had the $4 plate, and it was a good-sized portion - definitely filled my tummy with yummilious carrot cake and egg.\n\nThere was also a good balance of umami and Wok Hey to the dish, well worth the calories and indulgence. And the travel all the way from Tampines to Bishan!\n\nOwned by a young couple, with great positive attitude and naturally, the food was cooked with passion. The stall was also kept thoroughly clean. Hope more Customers will support this couple in their business venture!  :)",
