Lee K,5,"Very cosy place in Parkroyal Marina Bay hotel. It‚Äôs located on the 4th level and it‚Äôs a perfect spot for a drink or lunch/dinner. We had salmon and beef cubes, which were perfectly cooked and very delicious. Service is very attentive and friendly. Kudos to Richard for a great hospitality and making us feel very welcomed! üòÅ",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100200463824177284525/reviews
Helena Tahmizian,5,We had one lunch and one dinner seating at this place and both times it was a great experience. Wonderful service and nice ambience. You can even hear the birds chirping in the background. There is a diverse range of cuisine to choose from as well. I also found the resident robot who was helping delivering food quite cute.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105067764712043886683/reviews

Poh Soh Lee,5,"Had a great time chillax here after lunch. Ordered some drinks and chicken wings as snacks. Kids love their wings so much that we ordered a second order. Menu has typical hotel cafe offerings. Saw a few couples enjoying their high tea too.
Lovely deco and vibe, perfect for afternoon getaway from the intense noon heat.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107301070285258783270/reviews
