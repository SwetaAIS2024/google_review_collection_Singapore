      "text": "Situated up a hill away from the surrounding road traffic, the park is quiet and serene. Due to the park's relatively inaccessible location, it's users were mainly nearby residents. The many matured trees provide ample shade. The park have both a children's playground, an adult exercise corner and a dog run.\nMount Emily Park is an old park with a rich history. It was previously known as Bukit Rawa.\nRight at the park entrance is an entrance shelter which has an old beautiful emblem on its concrete wall. The emblem is a coat of arms granted to the Municipal Commission by the College of Heralds in April 1948.\nHistory has it that the shelter was the entrance to a former Mount Emily Swimming Pool.\nMount Emily used to have 2 Service Reserviors that were constructed in 1880. But by 1920, the reservior was rendered redundant as a new and bigger Fort Canning Service Reservior was being built replacing it. Mt Emily Service Reserviors were then converted into a swimming pool. But due to poor visitor ship the pool was closed down in 1981 and demolished. It was then turn into a park.\ncredit: Singapore trails",
