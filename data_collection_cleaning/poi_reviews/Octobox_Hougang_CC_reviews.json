      "text": "One of a newer concept of stores that made use of technology .. probably common in the Far East, still rather a novelty on this island.  Registered by mobile and palm scan . Enter via palm scan.  Rather specious little mart with chill drinks and vegetables section. K pop is blasting through the store. This place transport you to PRC as most goods are predominantly PRC products that is rather foreign to locals.   Some products are on good bargain others are a little bit more.\nAfter you select your stuff , wave to enter a room. Place the RFID tag goods on the shelf.  All products will be scan and you paid cashless via conventional credit card or PayLah.  Once done , door open on the other side and you leave. Please bring your own bags as no plastic bag are given as I noticed.",

      "text": "A very interesting place to go to. An unmanned venue that sells like a convenience store.\n\nOne of the latest concept store that has no cashier. The actual concept should be labelled as a cashierless convenience store. As there is still manpower around for stocks to be shelved and ensure that the process for payments and registrations.\n\nThe place is really the size of an average convenience store. There are coolers for drinks, ice-cream and snacks readily available for purchase. In terms of pricing, it is slightly cheaper than those convenience stores, ehem 7-ehem.. Which is a good deal for customers. Many can actually come by to jz purchase easily without the need of a cashier.. Actually Giant supermarket has this concept for a long time liao. So ya, same la..\n\nEntry must be via ur palm, as it is the required choice of usage. Make sure u register 1st and link ur paylah before entering as it is part of the registrations. So ya lo, easy in, easy out. D reason why we gave it a 4 star venue is because d items available is limited and there could be better options that can be incorporated into this.\n\nGo check it out, cheers!!\n\n#piquedwanderer #famwithsten #octobox #hougangcc",

You have to register your info to get into the shop as it’s a human-free shop so you have to check out yourself but it’s rather hassle free as they scan the whole basket when you place it in the cash register area.",
