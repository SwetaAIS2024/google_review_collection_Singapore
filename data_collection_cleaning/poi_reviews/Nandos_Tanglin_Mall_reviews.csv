k c123,4,"Have not tried Nando’s for quite awhile so I was pleasantly surprised when we dined at the Tanglin Mall the other night. The food tasted nice and the portion was decent. I really enjoyed the chicken thigh on skewers- the chicken was nicely done, the rice was fragrant and the accompanying veggies added to the oomph.  My companions also had good things to say about their orders. The place was not overly crowded on a Friday night.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110375681798195157814/reviews

TLC Is In The House,4,"If you crave a citrus tang and spicy kick, Nando's delivers and then some.

And if like me, you love chicken liver, Nando's actually serves up an addictive rendition of sauteed chicken liver in a zingy, spicy sauce. Damn, it's da bomb!

Those creamy chicken livers swim in a moreish tangy gravy and on our recent visit, ended up being the most enjoyable dish.

Our chicken thighs were alright, standard Nando's affair, juicy and tender but I personally like a greasy fried chicken. I might give their wings a spin the next time I head back for my liver-fix.

Now, if Nando's had margheritas, they'd be perfect!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116246063219109577345/reviews
M Rabbat,4,"Nice chicken and good choice of sides
I hadn’t been for a long time and was shocked by the tiny portions! Had to order quite a lot of sides to be able to feel satisfied
Was quite disappointed by the small portions …
Otherwise food is good and it’s. a great place for families with kids
You get a table very quickly in week ends which is quite rare",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113195629136056720674/reviews
