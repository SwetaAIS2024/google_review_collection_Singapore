Agnes Yeo,5,"2 of my kids goes here, 1 of which has graduated to Primary school and well adjusted. Principal and teachers are well established professionals. They're patient kind and caring. Big compound and a wonderful playground, they also often gets cleaned and spruced up. I'm very happy for my kids to attend this childcare center.
