      "text": "There is satisfactory range of potted plants and accessories. Prices are reasonable.\n\nHowever, staff attitude and service is disappointing. I was there at about 5.30pm on 4 May; hardly crowded. Initially I asked one about care of the plant I picked, then I asked another as I was about to make payment where was the queue suppose to start as people seemed to be approaching the cashier from both sides. Both staff showed annoyance and nearly raised their voices, not to mention no smiles. There were 3 staff behind the counter, 2 on the other side, the self-check machine was blocked by displays, could the inefficiency caused a jam at the checkout point? And much to customer disappointment; awful service. I replaced the plants I picked and made my way to the nurseries at Thomson Road.",

The space is massive, you can find anything from flower pots, fertilizer, plant pots, seeds, patio furniture and more. Plus if you buy $300 or more within 6 months (make sure to keep those receipts) you can become a member to get 10% off your purchases. I'll definitely be coming back more often.",

Pots and outdoor furniture are also sold. However I did not really fancy the range of pots available.\n\nStaff members are friendly and helpful in selecting plants and are knowledgable in plant care. Paid a repotting fee for $2.\n\nOne bad thing is that it can get really hot on a warm day so dress for the weather. Mosquitoes are also rampant (despite frequent pest control, or so I was told from the staff) so do bring mozzie repellent.",
