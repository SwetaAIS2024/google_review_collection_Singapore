Dr Lee Kai Lun is very approachable, caring and will spend time to understand & explain what is causing the medical issue. I also appreciate the quality of medicine issued, which strikes a good balance between affordability and efficacy. I recommend to give them a try if you're looking for a quality family doctor.",
