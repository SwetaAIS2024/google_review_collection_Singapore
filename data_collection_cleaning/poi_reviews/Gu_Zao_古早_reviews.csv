Wow‚Ä¶ to my surprise ; My 1st experience having breakfast set here with coffee O only $3 !
And the eggs here are slightly bigger in size as well, worth to recommend. üëç

Coffee O small sell 90 cents here & Milo $1.20 only ‚Ä¶.. etc

Previously, I used to paid $3.50 ~ $4.00 for a breakfast set meal; coffee O, bread toast & half boiled eggs.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104017026296774707444/reviews
