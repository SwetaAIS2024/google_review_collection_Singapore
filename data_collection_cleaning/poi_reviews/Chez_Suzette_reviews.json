But the true star of the evening was the crepe.Perfectly thin and soft, with just the right balance of flavors. The ingredients were fresh, and the presentation was beautiful.\n\nThe staff was attentive and friendly, which made the experience even more enjoyable. If you‚Äôre a fan of authentic French cuisine‚Äîor just great crepes‚Äîthis place highly recommended üëçüèª",

Big thanks to Frank, who‚Äôs really friendly and even gave me a mini tour of the restaurant. Perfect mix of vibes and flavors. Definitely coming back!",

The bread is soft and steak was good.\nAlso their crepe, has a nice sour sweet taste which is different from our usual butter and cinnamon crepe that we tried before.",

The staff, especially Nathan and the owner, were friendly and welcoming, which made the experience even better.\n\nThe starters were alright ‚Äî the escargot was okay, though it could have used more garlic. The house pour red wine was served cold, so do check if you prefer it at room temperature.\n\nThe mains, however, were very good ‚Äî tasty and satisfying. They really made the meal worth it.\n\nOverall, Chez Suzette is a great spot if you‚Äôre looking for a chill, easy-going place to enjoy dinner. I‚Äôd recommend it for a relaxed night out.",
