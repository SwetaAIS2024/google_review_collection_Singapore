Yi Ling,5,"Really really affordable handmade fosh paste product. Deep fried freshly!! The last time I came I don't recall having so many varieties, and it's getting more creative!

Our favourite was the flat fish paste as well as the wontons with fish paste. The fishballs are super juicy, bouncy and so rich in fresh fish paste flavours! The price is also so cheap",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115707001285123682601/reviews
Ken Peh,5,"Bought 3 big fishball, 5 fishcake and 3 fried wanton. Guess so many varieties how much? Only $4.50! We are in 2025 Bro, where to find such good price!? Unbelievable. And the taste is very good too. If you are here please visit and patronize this stall, super worth it.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
YY,3,"Very affordable fried food in this crowded hawker centre, even on a weekday morning!

$1.50 for 6 fishball is a win 👍🏻 though I can’t give more than 3 stars for how salty it was when eaten by itself.. probably need to eat this with rice or noodles to keep it down.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
Bob Lu,5,"Tiong Bahru Fried Fishball has been sprouting all over Singapore of late and I was surprised to find a stall at Kovan Market/Hawker Centre. I am especially fond of their otah fishcakes and beanskin fishcakes. It is one of my favourite go to fried fishballs/fishcakes stall since young at Tiong Bahru Market. This stall at Kovan, #01-60 opens from 730am to 700pm which is almost 12 hours. Support our local hawkers as F&B is a very tedious and laborious task. 💪💪💪",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102417187419000284994/reviews
