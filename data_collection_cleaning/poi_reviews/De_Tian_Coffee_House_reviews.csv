D. Low,3,"Food is ok here. Not much variety.
Don’t buy the drinks here if you can. Can of drink cost S$1.90!! $0.10 away from S$2.00 per can. Mini mart nearby can sell for 4 for S$2.60.
Fishball noodle is around S$3.50
Operator of this foodcourt cited high cost hence high price. Seriously? Compared to a coffeeshop in Shenton Way? You kidding me. That’s greed.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101061684691994105921/reviews

Celeste Poh,5,Renamed 德天.  I like the decor . Will vote for this best coffeeshop and best toilet decor. Cleanliness yet to judge as is newly open.  ambience is more like a cafe with different local choices of food ranging from the standard $ kopi o to the $$$$ zichar.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103918556137019278001/reviews
Danny Lee,5,"Nice place to have lunch. Not too hot, considering that it’s a sunny day. Food selection is comprehensive and price point quite reasonable. Ample parking behind the food court. Come by if you are in the area.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104709965556174578749/reviews
