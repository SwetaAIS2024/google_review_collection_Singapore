Rizqiyatul Mukhsinah,5,"Alright, this is by far the best and the most aromatic chicken rice I’ve had in Singapore. Chicken is a bit bland but it’s tender and well balanced with the aromatic rice. It’s just so good I had to buy one more to take home. Staffs are so nice and polite. Kopi is standard, but I don’t mind. I LOVE THE CHICKEN RICE SO MUCH!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102382921569796975829/reviews
khrhms,5,"Came across the outlet when I was at one-north for work and was surprisingly happy with the food and service at this chicken rice chain. Relatively cheap, a meal for 1 would cost abt $10 with chicken rice set with vegetables & drink. There are also western options apart from chicken rice. Friendly service rendered by the female supervisor. Good chili and the rice is not too heavy.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
Merli,5,This is cozy simple place to have your chicken rice even though I ordered thru foodpanda more frequently than eating at the eatery. The staff members are always friendly and the place is clean and well maintained. The staff chopping the chicken seems to be knowledgeable about hygiene when preparing the food.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115370228059187454742/reviews

TC HONG,4,"Well, given a change to ask, and Waitress told me this is fresh!!!

Well, 1 star and no more pantron to this quiet stall!

It deserved to be ignore!

Update: few moment later, a girl (look like person in charge) came back. She explained nicely to me that Veggie condition is due to Pasir Panjang Veggie center. They have limited stock and delay of the delivery. Hence, they served this veggie.

They refund me SGD1 since I put back the veggie to ""return tray"" area as I notice it is not fresh at all.

Moral of story: a simple gesture (telling the true) will secure the customer.

Sumarry: foods are not bad.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102246472969377659539/reviews
