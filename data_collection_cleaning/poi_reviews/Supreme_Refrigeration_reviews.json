      "text": "I used their cleaning service a few years ago and it was ok, until the air conditioner had a problem, they just kept sending someone to check (charging a lot of money each time), different groups of people came each time. They replaced the air conditioner parts, it cost 280 SGD, but the air conditioner is still not fixed, not cold at all. They also said that because my air conditioner needs to be deep cleaned, it will be fixed. Later, I didn't trust them anymore, so I went directly to Daikin's official technicians. It turned out that the parts inside the outdoor unit were broken. It makes me think that they are not very professional and responsible, and they will only make you spend more money. But if it's just general routine cleaning it's fine.",

      "text": "This is indeed the worst ac service co in Sing! They could not solve my ac problem for 2 yrs! Each time we called them for the same problem, they would send diff group of workers to check the same area, parts etc and they would tell problem solved! They led us round and round! Spoke to the boss, Scott, about our ac problem. He is totally an irresponsible guy! He refused to come down and check the problem despite me telling him the problem had persisted for almost 2 yrs! He just kept on sending workers, checked the same area, did the same thing and told me problem sloved! Whenever Scott promised to call us back to tell us how he should be solving the ac problem, he never did! We had to call and chase him and his answer again would be, \"I will send my men down to check\" and then the cycle would repeat. This is the worst service company I had come across!  For such company, CASE should be informed.",
