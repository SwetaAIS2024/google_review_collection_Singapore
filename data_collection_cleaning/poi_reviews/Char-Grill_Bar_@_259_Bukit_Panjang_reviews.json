Apparently ordering machine was down and staff at counter didnt seem happy about the extra workload. Took the wrong order and kept asking if eating in or take away even though it was the first question that was answered. Wont be coming back for the food and service.",

Most main comes with 2 sides. But didnâ€™t enjoy the fish selection.. grilled fish with lemon butter sauce. Fish was a little dry. Ended up asking more butter from the person. Should have ordered the grilled chickens maybe. But overall, it filled our stomachs.",

So how the hell would I know how your pos system works. In the end silly me, went off without checking still has onions. So much for saying that your system \"will indicate\".",
