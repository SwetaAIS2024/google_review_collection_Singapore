Selvinia Nofy,5,"The best nasi padang I've had in town so far is this place, located in Sunway, where there are many nearby restaurants. I didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food! I especially loved the cow's lung. The sambal is mildly spicy but incredibly addictive. I will definitely return to try more dishes!

In terms of pricing, it's reasonably affordableâ€”not too expensive but not the cheapest either. Plus, there is easy parking available nearby.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102676437011264302982/reviews

Kimberley Howarth,5,"We were recommended this restaurant from a facebook group. And we cant believe we didnt find it sooner! Very excellent rumah padang. Large variety of self-service dishes and many favourites like gulai nangka (absolutely delicious by the way!). Many varieties of meat dishes... some I don't know the name but the beef is so tender and well-cooked. And the crispy beef was just like eating crisps/kerupuk! Sambal ijo was another win. They also sell other products like crispy beef skin kerupuk and teh botol. They are a bit more expensive than other places we have been to... the bill for 2 people at lunch was around RM50... but we did pick quite a few items. And I think for the location, taste and quality of the food it was well worth it. We look forward to come back again!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957590885643931784/reviews
Kinjal Doshi,5,"The service was impressive - they help explain each dish to my guests, and supported their requests (e.g. spicy, part of meat, etc.). The food, itself, was delicious and satisfying. We were able to take portions to suit our appetites, and nothing went to waste.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114174021119243511734/reviews
Qhulz Yana,3,Had lunch for 2 pax and it cost Rm44. Drinks only teh o kosong and hot teh. The rendang meat was so hard and I informed the waitress that I can't even bite it instead she use scissors and cut into small pieces and told me it should be fine. I had a tough time chewing the meat. The least they could do is exchange to a new meat instead but NO. Well its ok.. I am not going to dine here anymore. And the price is ridiculously pricey. There are better Minang places out there with reasonable price.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104377556172999172645/reviews
