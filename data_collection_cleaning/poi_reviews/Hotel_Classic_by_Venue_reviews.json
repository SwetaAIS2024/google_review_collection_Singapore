      "text": "Fantastic budget hotel without any of the trappings. If you need an overnight stay if transitting in Singapore, this is the best one I've found so far (I transit often). Rooms are small but clean. They include filtered water faucets. Clean bathrooms that have wash hoses - I was really happy with the last part. The location is fantastic too - close to the airport while also giving you a spot from which to go downtown if needed quite quickly. Close to transit and the big park and beach. My only feedback is that I got too many calls before checkout, though I had requested and gotten late checkout confirmation on check-in. Otherwise, splendid stay and I will be coming back.",

      "text": "I had a wonderful stay at this hotel in Singapore. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, making me feel right at home. The hotel itself was very clean and well-maintained, providing a comfortable and tidy environment throughout my stay.\n\nIts location is incredibly convenient, with both MRT and bus stops just a short walk away, making it easy to explore the city. Plus, there are plenty of food options nearby, so finding a meal was never a problem.\n\nConsidering the quality of the service and amenities, the price was very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Singapore – a great value for the location and experience!",

Surprisingly large shower for such a tiny room. Only about 15 mins from Changi airport so a good option if your overnighting for a connection and don't want to pay the airport hotel rate.",

      "text": "It was a very good value for money\nStaff were friendly and attentive, rooms were clean and comfortable though small (that’s how in singapore anyway).\nIt was helpful they allowed checking in bags early in morning though our room check in was in the evening. We stayed 4-5 days here during our Singapore tour\nOnly downside was they didn’t have breakfast and there were no good food in the neighborhood.\nAnd point for improvement, the TV kept on resetting, where it views TV channel searching where as it should stay on HDMI mode. Staff wasn’t aware they had to use a master remote control though I insisted. But finally they used it after couple of back and forth visits.\nCan recommend for families, friends and individuals. We’ll go back when we visit Singapore again",
