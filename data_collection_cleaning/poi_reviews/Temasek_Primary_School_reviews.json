Our son just completed P6.\n\nRight from Mdm Has, Mrs Ho, Mr Goh(maths), Ms Soon(science), Mdm Low(chinese) to the vast majority are thoroughly professionally and exhibit palpable intent to uplift children.However, an unrepentant English teacher was largely demotivating and repetitively negative towards the students - the leadership knows and hope they address this.\n\nWe chose this school because of their track record of partnership with parent groups, parents, etc. And they definitely kept their reputation in this regard.\n\nThank you.TPS team and leadership.",
