The coffee was brewed perfectly, and my favorite Caramel Macchiato was spot-on!\n\nThe seating area was cozy and clean, offering a nice place to relax or get some work done. Despite being in a busy mall, the ambiance was peaceful, and the Wi-Fi connection was reliable.\n\nDefinitely my go-to Starbucks in Singapore! Highly recommend for anyone in the area looking for great coffee and excellent!",

He truly went above and beyond — incredibly patient, kind, and attentive. After I accidentally spilled my drink, he didn’t just help clean up the mess without hesitation, but even replaced it with a new one. His thoughtful gesture and warm attitude really made our evening.",
