C,4,"The Siglap Canal Lookout Deck is a thoughtfully designed recreational space located at the end of Siglap Canal in East Coast Park. Developed under PUB‚Äôs Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme, it transforms a previously overlooked section of the park into a vibrant community focal point.

The lookout deck itself offers unobstructed waterfront views and is equipped with seating and planter boxes, making it a relaxing spot for both quiet reflection and informal gatherings. It‚Äôs one of the best places in the park to catch a sunrise or sunset, or simply sit and chill with the sea breeze.

An adjacent open lawn adds to the space, offering room for picnics, casual sports, or yoga ‚Äî with the whole area able to host up to 1,250 people. I‚Äôd rate it a 4 out of 5. It‚Äôs calm, scenic, and well-integrated into the park ‚Äî a hidden gem for those who appreciate quiet corners with a view.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
