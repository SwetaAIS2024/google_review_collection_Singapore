lontongstroong,4,"Been traversing the route pretty often in my free time, although the starting point is always from the south (Buona Vista). It's generally a pleasant route for running, particularly in good weather. It's just a flat straight route all along. Just be sure to wear a good footwear since a few sections of the track are often flooded during or after downpours. It also could've been better if more sheds installed along the route as shelter during heavy rains.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
Waikong Chia,5,Great place to walk or cycle. It can be a bit busy in the morning and evening. There are no lights at night to keep the path natural for wild animals.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104442143267773247344/reviews
