KK Tham,3,The food meets expectations. The prawns in the bittergourd soup were fresh. The beef curry is also good. Service is better than the average zirchar outlet.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104852765191391402917/reviews

lim chin tat,3,"Ordered 14 dishes - cereal prawns, salad prawns, salted chicken, sambal kangkong, crab meat tofu, hot plate tofu, sweet and sour portal, Mongolian pork ribs, garlic pork tendon, clay pot noodles, clay pot sea cucumber, fried crispy sotong, egg plants.

Crispy sotong really bad - not crispy at all. Soggy and soft. Cereal prawns too much flour. Clay pot noodles tasteless. Sweet sour pork also soft and soggy. Better dishes - kang Kong, garlic tendon, salted chicken and crab meat tofu.

Boss and staff friendly. Dishes served really fast. Service good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900562659252889927/reviews
Van Chan,5,"My family has been coming to this ZhiChar place for more than 7 years.

Simple reason: Food is very yummy and reasonably priced.

I have brought my friends here and they loved it too.

Must-try dishes:
1. Fish Head Curry
2. Har Cheong Gai (Prawn Paste Chicken)
3. Cereal Prawns
4. Pork Ribs
5. Fried Rice - I’m a big fan of fried rice! I’m so glad that their fried rice comes with real medium sized prawns instead of the teeny weeny prawns & fake crab meat that many zhichar stalls serve in SG.

The service is friendly and efficient. The boss is super friendly and would joke with customers when he’s not too busy.

We came here for our Chinese New Year Reunion Dinner tonight. A total of 5 dishes only cost around $98. It’s very hard to find this kind of pricing in Singapore.

It’s my fav Zhichar place in the East.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102169738300622572121/reviews
