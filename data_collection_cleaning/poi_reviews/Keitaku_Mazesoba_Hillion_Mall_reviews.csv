Loo Denkins,4,"Shop is rather lowkey, somewhat easy to miss since it faces out of the mall. The mazesoba was satisfying to eat and the ingredients complemented each other well, though it felt a little pricey, or perhaps I'm just ignorant of what goes into making the bowl of noodles. It wasn't crowded at all during dinner time, so I think one could enjoy a relatively quiet meal here in an otherwise busy mall.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117551637270239112351/reviews
Dan Lim,5,"Great ramen at good price! Generous portions to start off with.
Soup broth is tasty and doesn't not leave a ""salty or thirsty"" aftertaste.

All you can eat refills for soup, hard boiled eggs, noodles and green tea. Legit! No questions asked!

Staff are very friendly and don't give you frowns from refills.

Cosy setup. Corner store beside McDonald's.
Restaurant does not have oily smell. You leave the place with a full stomach, and not with food stench on your clothes.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114320165453709605732/reviews
Amanda Tan,5,"Small cozy shop along the outside of Hillion mall.
They have dry and soup ramen here.

Not full house even though it is a Saturday peak lunch hour.

We went for the sets that comes with free flow of eggs, noodles, green tea, soup.
Tofu cannot refill

Nice comfort food for the cooling rainy weather.

They would even ask you if you are full before you leave the shop. ü§£ü§£ü§£ Loved such service!

Highly recommend!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118151158455216779709/reviews
The Tohtoro,5,"Tried the $15.90 Signature Chicken Mazesoba, and it was really really good. The noodles were chewy and flavourful, whilst not overpowering. I could easily down the entire bowl and so did my partner. Despite the somewhat steep cost (especially for students), you will leave feeling satisfied and satiated with the ability to add rice to the leftover sauce upon finishing the soba, and the free flow hard-boiled eggs

The service staff were amazing as well, always checking up on us despite us only being situated at one corner of the restaurant. They actively came up to our seating area and asked to refill our free flow hard-boiled eggs without us seeking them out for them.

Atmosphere is slightly lacking due to the limited space Singapore provides, but the overall service and food fully makes up for that fact.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102021607187933413278/reviews
Faye Yap (Âè∂Ê†©ÁªØ),5,"The Mazesoba is pretty tasty, but I feel that I still prefer ramen over it. Could be a personal preference though. Anyways, they offer a meal with free flow noodles, tea, eggs (hard boiled) and soup. You also have an option to get a portion of rice to eat with the leftover sauce. So honestly, if you‚Äôre really hungry, eat here because it‚Äôll definitely be filling and worth your money!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101750484940912874032/reviews
