Fion Choo,5,"To me, this has always been the perfect Mee pok. The famous Ah hoe mee pok originally in West Coast is finally in the East. Both husband and wife are at this outlet. So happy to find them again.

Love their fish and teochew dumplings, crispy pork lard and Al Dante mee pok. Add noodles for free also! Located inside 119 Eating House.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116493973711794898168/reviews
