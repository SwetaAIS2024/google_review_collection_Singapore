Kenneth Loh Fook Leng,5,"Bukit Panjang Gospel Chapel (BPCG) is a wonderful church for worshippers to worship. Especially those who yearn to get close to God. It has worship services both on Saturdays & Sundays for the youths & adults as well as Sundays Schools for children & seniors. Services are conducted in both English & Mandarin.

For those who want to renew their strength in God, please come. Through the sermons, you may find answers from Him.
For those who desire to serve God, please come. You may find a suitable place to serve to the best of your abilities, talents & gifts from God.
