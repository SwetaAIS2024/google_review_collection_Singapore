Javier Chua,1,"Ordered our food around 12:15pm and only got our first dish around more than half an hour later. The table beside us was wrongly served a beef burger, so one of the servers cleared the plate and walked to the other side of the restaurant (not towards the kitchen). He reappeared a second later with the same burger and gave it to us.
We waited another 5-10 minutes for our sides (wings and fries) to come. The rest of our mains came at 1:10-1:20pm, which included bolognese pasta, pesto pasta and a ribeye. The ribeye was rare and unevenly cooked even though we ordered medium. The bolognese pasta was slightly watery. The pesto pasta was extremely oily, and the salmon was extremely salty. At this point, we had waited for more than an hour and could not have waited any longer for the poorly-prepared food to be replaced.
While it is understandable that restaurants may have long wait times, and granted that they were hosting a big corporate group, the group had pre-ordered their food, which should have given a reputable chain like Harry's ample heads-up to make sure that their other customers get their orders in a timely and satisfactory manner. There was little consolation given for the long wait time, and the server who served us someone else's food also got frustrated when we asked for updates on our missing sides and mains.

June Shun,4,"Salmon is now paired with spaghetti which is better than brown rice. No longer dry, complements the salmon well. Spaghetti bolognese is average, not enough meat.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115180409699058168392/reviews
Ming Hui,5,Have been to this outlet quite a few times as it is near many offices. Nice cosy place. Good to visit for lunch or after work for drinks. Love the 1 for 1 set meal ongoing at Harry's. I love the laksa spaghetti the most. The fish and chip is ok. The cabonara is good. The salmon is fresh and yummy. The beef rendang is not as great though. So maybe can skip that.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108198322351045531056/reviews
