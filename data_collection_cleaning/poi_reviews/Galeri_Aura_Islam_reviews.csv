Aida Sait,5,Love to be here. The tickets are a bit pricey but I'm sure it's worth it. Went here with my big family of 18. We were quite lucky as we got to hear the explanation from a guide who was going through every exhibit to a group of tourist. We felt so blessed as we got the opportunity to see for ourselves all the exhibits in close range. We end our trip here by getting a group photo for our big family here.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111299166656363078132/reviews

Fahad Mir,5,"I had an extraordinary and deeply emotional experience at the Muslim Museum, which showcases an array of spiritually significant artifacts. Among the most touching exhibits were the turban, stick, milk pot, letter, and water pot belonging to the revered Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him).

Witnessing these sacred relics up close brought a profound sense of awe and reverence. The museum's curation and presentation of these items were exceptional, allowing visitors to connect with the rich history and spirituality of Islam.

As I stood in front of these precious belongings, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with emotions, and tears welled up in my eyes. It was an incredibly moving encounter, and it deepened my appreciation for the profound impact of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on the Islamic faith.

The Muslim Museum is an essential pilgrimage for anyone seeking to strengthen their spiritual connection with Islam's heritage. The way it preserves and showcases these sacred artifacts creates a unique and soul-stirring experience that lingers long after leaving the premises. I highly recommend visiting this museum to anyone looking for a profoundly spiritual journey.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115181474233796293084/reviews
Nur Eiliyah Haseenah Ibrahim,5,"Great place and worth to go! Just a suggestion, maybe the organiser should collaborate with a VR organiser on Islamic histories as an add on so that guests will have a more powerful impact.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111465444330425999243/reviews
