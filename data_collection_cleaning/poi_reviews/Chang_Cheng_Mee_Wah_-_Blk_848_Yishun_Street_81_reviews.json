This is the silly rules i heard in zhi char stall, this is coffeeshop not your restuarant.",

      "text": "The fish soup stall food is nice, but slightly pricey for the portion. Double fish soup at 8.50sgd. i would advise everyone, especially those who take away their food, to pay extra attention to the food portion or add ons. I have bought fish soup from them and there has been a handful of times they left out the add ons and i only realised it when i reached home. Intentional? I dont know. Today i went back to the shop to feedback, they did top up the add on but there was no apology.",
