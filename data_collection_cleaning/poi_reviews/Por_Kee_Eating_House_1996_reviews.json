However, the quailty of the food seems to have fallen short from my previous visit.\n\nGive the Coffee Pork Ribs and Fish maw soup a try\n\nRatings of food:  ⭐️/5\n1) Coffee Pork Ribs ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nProbably the best thing we ordered. Good balance of coffee flavour, pork ribs were cooked well with a good balance of fat and meat.\n\n2) Fish maw soup ⭐️⭐️⭐️\nThick texture, well seasoned soup with bits of minced pork.\n\n3) Crispy chicken ⭐️⭐️⭐️\nChicken skin was crispy, and the meat was well seasoned. However, it was a little dry.\n\n4) Homemade tofu ⭐️⭐️\nTofu was well done, with soft interior.\nThe flavour of the gravy was okay.\n\n5) Omelette with onions ⭐️\nOmelette was alright. Onions were cooked well. Can give this dish a miss.",

The salted egg prawn was the best for me. The service was great and they serve quite fast. Highly recommended",

We stayed in the area and found this hidden gem nearby.\n\nEverything we ordered was delicious, especially the sweet n sour pork and the fried rice. Prices are on the high side but the food is worth it.\n\nThe server who took our order was friendly and spoke a bit of English, the rest of them weren't.",

Pork ribs  was sweet and savory, prawns were plump and we especially loved the cereal batter, while the chicken was nicely flavored.\n\nIt's a pity that takeouts would have brought it down a notch in terms of crisp but we enjoyed it nonetheless.\n\nPrice unfortunately was on the high side. Bill came up close to $90 for all small servings.",

Yam ring and kailan can skip but the rest were worth it!\n\nLocated at the hipster place - tiong bahru neighbourhood. The restaurant looks abit rundown on the outside but still comfortable to dine in, with more indoor and outdoor seats. The staff were friendly despite being quite busy, rare for zichar stall where you always get unfriendly uncles or aunties.\n\nNot sure why, but lots of foreigners tho they are many local chinese as well! Will visit again for sure!",
