I arrived at 1145pm and I was shocked that there are only about 5 tables occupied in the entire club.\n\nMusic selection was so poor by their in house dj. Had totally spoiled the mood for countdown into a new year. No table was excited for the countdown.\nThere was dancers as well however, it was 2 ladyboy and we were shocked by the choice of dancers for a countdown event.\n\nFew months ago when I was there on a weekday and there was 0 people inside other than us however, the dj xen was extremely good.\n\nThe only star given was to 1 of their staff who was looking after our table. He was very friendly and attentive and took care of our table. He even gave complimentary snacks as it was our friend birthday.",

And for those wanting a break from the party, there are also many karaoke rooms lining the corridors right outside Fate which you can book to sing your hearts out.\n\nCephas was the one who attended to us and he was really friendly, warm, and provided excellent service to me and my friends. I highly recommend looking for him during your visit.\n\nAll in all, it was a fantastic night out, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",
