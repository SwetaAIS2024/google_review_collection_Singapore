Loved the ambience with live music, and the staff were very attentiveâ€”made sure all our food arrived on time. Will definitely come back!",

      "text": "Came here after walking out of downtown east and found this quiet area located at the Aranda Club. Donâ€™t worry they are open to the public.  Good to get a table on a Friday night. Menu was very comprehensive. Lots of options especially if you come with a larger group. But also good for dining for 2. We decided to try different proteins, portions were just right. Options of beverages were wide for both alcohol and non alcoholic. Bad thing as Iâ€™ll need to take longer to decide. But this is a good problem to have. Was pretty suprise that the price offered good value. Iâ€™m sure will try again soon. Hope to come with a bigger group next time round. ðŸ˜Š",

This is my first time visiting the restaurant, and I just realized itâ€™s a Vietnamese restaurant, situated right in front of a clubhouse.\n\nWe came for a quick post-drink. Ordered two beers, a plate of grilled pork skewers, and a plate of French fries.\nThe grilled pork skewers were delicious, while the fries were just your typical fries.\n\nThe indoor seating area is quite spacious, and thereâ€™s also outdoor seatingâ€”seems like a great spot if you have pets. I also noticed the restaurant offers a wide selection of Vietnamese coffee for purchase.",
