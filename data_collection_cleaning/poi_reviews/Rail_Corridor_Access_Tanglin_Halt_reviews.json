      "text": "Great access point connecting Tanglin Halt to the Rail Corridor and linking easily to One-North. Well-constructed path that makes it easy to hop onto the relatively peaceful trail for a walk, jog, or cycle. From here, you can head toward Alexandra, Buona Vista, or One-North, depending on your route. Perfect for anyone in the Tanglin Halt or One-North area looking to explore the Rail Corridor.",
