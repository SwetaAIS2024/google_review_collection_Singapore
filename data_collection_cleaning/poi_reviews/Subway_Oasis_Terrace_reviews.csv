Li Feng,5,"The Subway outlet at Oasis Terrace is a clean and modern spot to grab a quick bite. The sandwiches are fresh and flavorful, with a good selection of bread, fillings, and sauces. While the service is efficient, the seating area is cozy, making it a nice place to enjoy your meal. A great option for a healthy and satisfying choice when youâ€™re in the area!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105807436200681938352/reviews

sue (swong),3,Clean outlet with plenty of tables. The music was so loud that we couldn't hear the staff speak behind their masks and I felt bad I had to keep asking them to repeat 2-3 times. Even had to talk more loudly to my friend when we were eating.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111390923105747476416/reviews
