      "text": "I have been seeing Dr. Lok for more than 10+ years (in fact, followed him from his previous clinic to this one even though Hougang quite far from my current home). The good thing is that the MCSP is right next to his clinic, easy to park and walking 2 mins to the clinic is sheltered. Dr. Lok is very experienced, dte and charges are reasonable.\n\nI found it best to call ahead to ensure they are open/available as the clinic can get busy & may have to decline walk-ins even if one may arrive before their closing hours (they may have earlier patients to see, which may extend well into closing hours). The reception staff/nurses are usually doing some admin work/getting medicine ready so sometimes, they may not be too chatty so they don't give out wrong stuff. :)",

Highly recommended to see him if need arises.\n\nHowever the single star rating is more like a dead star and exclusively given to the receptionist the one who has long hair bespectacled and fair skinned. Her extreme rudeness is palpable and fills the whole clinic waiting area. She is l must say the WORST recept l have ever encountered. I believe l am not the only one who thinks so. Worse still having intereacted with her made me feel more sick while waiting for my turn to see Dr Lok .\n\nI do hope Dr n management take this sincere feedback seriously because she is really toxic and damaging not to mention her adverse effect on patients. Thank you once again Dr Lok",

      "text": "Went to this clinic for the first time and was at the receptionist counter. This young nurse wearing spects and fair skinned is like a ROBOT. She did not say a single word and just stared at me when I’m at the counter, usually nurses will ask if it’s your first time or not etc, no? I took out my IC then she begin asking me to fill up a form etc.\n\nThen after waiting for an hour, I wanted to go out to get a drink but was afraid I would miss my turn, went to ask the nurse how many people there are in front of me, because you know sometimes queue number may jump and it’s not accurate. So I said “can I ask how many people there are in front of me before it’s my turn, my queue number is 31”. Then she replied with an expressionless face “YES”. I’m like huh? I’m asking you how many people there are in front of me? Then she obviously looks impatient and just said “5”.\n\nShe is such a ROBOT and I wonder why is she doing this job. Simply RUDE! Lucky the experience with the doctor is fine, though the waiting time is really long. He is experienced and assuring and prescribed me some medicines that made me feel better.",
