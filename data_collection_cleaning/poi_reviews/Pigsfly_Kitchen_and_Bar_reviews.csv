EatSleepChyll L,3,Nice place to chill out in the evening. They have beer that is low carb! Make you feel ‘less guilty’ guzzling a pint or two. The Thai dishes we ordered were alright. But I think the price is a little on the high side. I’ll go once a while and whenever my wallet can afford it.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112218025624285073381/reviews
Vivi Tay,5,"Tried their Thai and Western cuisine for takeaway, and everything was great! The food was ready really fast, so there was hardly any waiting time. Thai food was my favorite—super flavorful and authentic! The rest of the family also enjoyed their meals and had good things to say. Definitely a spot we’ll order from again!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100358096223768926516/reviews
Angie Chng,2,"Bad choice when there are a few other Thai food choices nearby. Tried the pineapple fried rice years ago and it was definitely better back then, hence we thought to give this place a try when we were nearby. What a shame.

The beef noodles were totally bland,  and beef slices were hard and dry. We didn't finish it not because we were full, but really didn't enjoy it at all.  The crispy omelette was oily and a little too salty. We had to go elsewhere for a cup of Chinese tea to feel better after the meal. Would have prefer they separate the coconut milk from the mango and sticky rice instead of soaking them in the coconut milk.

Portions were big but considering the price and taste, it is definitely one of the worst Thai food we ever had.

Service was attentive. But I guess we need good food to be returning customers.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108764242257700631083/reviews
JATHL,4,"I quite like their pizza and their bar snacks are better than those at many other places. Reasonably priced for that area and most of their full time wait staff are quite attentive and friendly.
On weekends, when it gets busy, service standards might drop a bit.
They also serve Thai and North Indian cuisine.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110357299060106350854/reviews
