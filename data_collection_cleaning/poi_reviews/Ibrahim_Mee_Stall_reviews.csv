Ivan Teh,4,"Mee Goreng (SGD $7) @ Ibrahim Mee Stall.
.
Established since 1995, this famed stall is now run by 3rd-generation owner Syed Ibrahim.
.
Their rendition has chewy soft yellow noodles, crisp bean sprouts, wispy chicken egg, soft red onions, crunchy cabbage, and tender diced mutton. Carries smoky grainy sweet salty meaty savoury vegetal spice flavour.
.
Completed with crunchy cucumber with vegetal sweet flavour, and a nice fried chicken egg with runny yolk and eggy savoury sweet flavour.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114332345573544911646/reviews
Ivan Tay,1,"Owner with a bad attitude. I asked for Maggie Goreng with sausage, was served with mee goreng with sausage instead, and claims I’m the one who said wrongly.

He proceeds to cook Maggie goreng for me but picked out the sausages and egg from the wrongly cooked plate and threw it into my Maggie goreng.

Worst of all, the food was tasteless and was charged $6.50 for it. Didn’t even finish half of my plate and didn’t bother putting a pic of it here because it was that bad.

Never order from this stall unless you want to have terrible food and an argue for fun.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109601976320477526335/reviews
Maznan Abdul Rani,1,Very bad service. Ask for half cook fried egg for mee goreng.. Give me a dry and hard fried egg. Give the seller a feedback. Instead he argue back with stern and rude face..

blackcoupe,5,"One of the most traditional long time favourite for Mee Goreng with egg. They do it with a flare ... hmm with a memorable mouth watering unique old school style. Somehow get the taste of the heat of the flame in the Mee, if I am making any sense at all.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117507784141300452476/reviews
