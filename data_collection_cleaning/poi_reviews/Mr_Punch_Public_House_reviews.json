Service was attentive and hospitable, but then again the restaurant was quite empty. Cosy environment that's quirky and interesting because of the interior design! Would come again. Chicken roulade and salmon was really good",

It small and cozy but maybe due to its location people who walk pass might not realise this place.\n\nThe food is so-so not something I would go back again. The truffle fries taste more like a normal fries. I had the pork rib which comes w bbq sauce. I think it is fine but just that the presentation is disappointing. Pork ribs w some slices which I guess should be potato below. Suggest they shld improve the presentation skills of dish. We wanted to had dessert here initially but the mains turn us off till we decide maybe we shld go elsewhere instead.",

      "text": "The beef short ribs were wonderfully tender and flavourful.\nThe duck ragout pasta was overwhelmed by the Parmesan cheese sprinkled and the pasta didn't come well together with the duck ragout.\nHowever the manager was very attentive and proactive to ask if we didn't enjoy the pasta seeing it was returned with most of it untouched. He repeatedly offered us with replacement dishes or wine when we turned down initially. It was really pleasant to receive such great service which we would definitely return again as it is still a good place for friends to gather.",
