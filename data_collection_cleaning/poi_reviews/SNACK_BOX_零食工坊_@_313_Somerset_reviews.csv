Tingdong Ting,1,"Staff here at 313 attitude was very bad when I was asking about the products, and no patience to serve with bad moody and not willing to serve.
I told her will feed back to your company, she said "" up to me"" with loud and bad attitude.  Actually I want to buy Dried Strawberry, but due to her attitude, I walked away.
I ever went few of your shop, others was very good.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111319996978564203192/reviews

Anjay Yap,5,"They have a wide variety of dried snacks, besides fruits, they also selling dried vege and nuts. I highly recommend the dried strawberry, each piece is plump, tangy, sweet and crispy. I couldn't resist putting them in my shopping basket after trying them! Initially, I wasn't fond of vegetables, but the staff recommended I try the okra and mushrooms, and I instantly fell in love. They didn't have the usual vegetable taste, and they were so crispy and delicious! The mushroom flavor even had a hint of saltiness, which is perfect for those who prefer savory snacks.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104853672944420436638/reviews
