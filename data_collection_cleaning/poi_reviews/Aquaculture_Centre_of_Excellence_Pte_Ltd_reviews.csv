Elizaa John,4,"Excellent customer service. Vacuum-packed, cleaned and fresh. Value for money. My ikan bakar was oooo la la!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109668835666216905480/reviews
Daphne Seow,5,"Highly recommend! This is my third time purchasing from them!

The seafood bought is fresh, cleaned and well-packed, sealed in individual packaging with a clear label indicating the type of fish and weight. The seabass is locally farmed while the salmon is farmed in Chile. The smoked seabass is yummy too. Especially like the grouper and trevally too.

They try to be environmentally friendly by not using styrofoam boxes for delivery, and you can return the aluminum packaging and ice packs.

Prices are affordable, and there are promotions available. Pick up and delivery are available. The people at the store are friendly, and the delivery uncle is very kind too. Do support local business!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104327864622972505344/reviews
