KW Yoke,5,"Good dimsum, large portions, low cost.
Their charsiew bao had a unique flavour, and I was quite impressed by their congee which came in a big bowl and tasted just right without being too bland or salty, and with plenty of meatballs.

Would come again to try other stuff!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101653153694763341697/reviews
Joseph Lee,4,"Good dim sum, fried carrot cake, siew mai and century egg porridge very good. Only that we ordered Liu SAR BAO end up with Char Sao BAO...next time must counter the order..the coffee at the coffee shop is really horrible..to sour. Does not compliment the breakfast. Also the dim sum quite expensive.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105389658978186330108/reviews
