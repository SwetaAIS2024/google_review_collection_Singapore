Wanted to leave a review today as I’m very pleased with his service. Sincere in his approach and care towards patients, his treatments and medication are also at affordable rates that I don’t have to worry about breaking the bank. I would recommend him in a heartbeat to anyone who needs an expert in skin care!",

The staff was very professional, and they took the time to assess my skin condition thoroughly. They recommended a combination of treatments, including facials and laser therapy. After a few sessions, my acne has significantly improved, and my skin is clearer than it’s been in a long time. I’m so grateful to the team at Apax Medical for helping me regain my confidence. Highly recommend for anyone with stubborn acne!",

I booked an appointment for minor surgery at Kovan on December 13, but after checking with your staff, I learned that I need an antibiotic. I have sent two messages, along with a picture of my prescription, to confirm the date of my surgery so that I can plan my work schedule accordingly. Unfortunately, I have not received a response. It feels like your staff is not interested in assisting me, which is quite frustrating.",

      "text": "This clinic penalises people who are punctual. I came on the dot/ probably earlier for my appointment but was led to the waiting area which is understandable. There can be some delays here and there. But it gotten out of hand after waiting for more than 30 minutes, seeing people coming after me but able to consult first. I asked the reception and they said that their appointment was earlier, hence, the justification. I’m like, aren’t they late? The person that went before me was late for 30 mins but still got in ahead of me because the persons appointment time is earlier. Ridiculous logic. Lack of common sense here",
