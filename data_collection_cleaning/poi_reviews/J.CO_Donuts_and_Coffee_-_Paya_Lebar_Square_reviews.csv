Adrianne Bernardo,5,"Damn! The donuts were super fresh! Soft! Not too sweet but just moderate sweetness! I love it! I both tried iced and hot drinks and both taste good. The jco cafe is the best donut cafe in Singapore because they serve freshly baked donuts, soft and delicious and it's cheaper hence quality of donut is great. I just wish they have more seats, wider dining area so that people can sit and dine, my advice for improvement and for better service.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112854354066959885734/reviews
