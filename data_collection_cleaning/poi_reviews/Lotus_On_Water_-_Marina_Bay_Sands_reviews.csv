Xoom Too,5,"It’s a medium sized pond with purple lotuses which are just beautiful to look at especially at night as they just pop. The location is great as it’s in front of the Shoppes of Marina Bay Sands and to the right next to the ArtScience Museum.

There’s also a small section all around the pond to sit which ends up filling up in the later parts of the day and on weekends. Overall, worth visiting or passing by especially in the area.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105863133358477079886/reviews

Me Le,4,"Tranquil spot to take a rest and admire the views. Pond is filled with water lilies and reflections of the surrounding architecture and also some goldfish / koi. Less favourable is that despite no smoking signs around, there were a few puffers polluting the environment for everyone else :-(",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113857962679699657883/reviews
