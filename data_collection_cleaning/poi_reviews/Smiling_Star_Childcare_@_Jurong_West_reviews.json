      "text": "I strongly recommend Smiling Star Jurong West Pte Ltd . My daughter Lynette was enrolled since she was 20 months old , initially was hesitant to put her playgroup as she emotionally sensitive, cries when she see strangers and weak in her motor skills . The teachers were kind and patient , even the cooking auntie is attentive . My girl learnt to walk confidently and less cries by H√∂ng lao shi to progressing to run and jump , witness her first moments of self-feeding by teacher Fazlin , opening up to other kids in play and ever neat and tidy dressing by Teacher Lavinia , starting to sing Mandarin songs and enjoying herself by Lin lao shi, careful ensuring the food are not too hot by cooking aunties .Last by not least , the assuring and encouraging principal Krish who confidently ensures the safety and child development of my daughter is in good progress . Those kind gestures big and small  , our family are deeply thankful for providing tender , lovingly care in nurturing my girl from \"baby\" to a smiling toddler.  Indeed nurturing future \"smiling stars\" ! Thank you very much ^^",
