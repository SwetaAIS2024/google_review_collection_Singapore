Honey Belle Dionisio,3,"Ordered the ebiko chicken burger set, the veggies are fresh and it tastes good. Classic wagyu burger is delicious too. Tried the beef cheese fries as well popcorn chicken, tastes wise, they are really yummy. Reason why 3 stars is given, this is ordered via delivery but 1 set of the orders did not come with fries and drinks. I was not refunded too despite numerous times of follow ups. It was not a good experience at all!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112880669662727512574/reviews
