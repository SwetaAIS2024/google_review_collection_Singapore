Wajihah Wahid,5,"My daughter has blossomed and grown so well under the guidance of Principal Angeline and her group of teachers.

Teachers all work together very well and are very friendly and loving to all the kids.

School is clean and communication with the teachers is very fast & efficient.

Honestly have no complaints; superb school. I wish i could send my daughter there all the way but we had to transfer school as we have moved.

Special shoutout to Tian Lao shi and Teacher Fa; no words can express how grateful I am for taking care of my girl. üíï",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109359584753655567740/reviews
Cally Ng,5,"I visited the school in end Aug‚Äô23 and met principal Angeline Mah for a school visit as I had intended to enroll my child in LFP bishan. It was a very enriching experience. Angeline took me through the school and explained the different classes and the school ciriculumn.

While the facilities are standard, I would like to applaud Angeline and her team of teachers as I could see the passion, as well as love for teaching to the children. They jump through hoops as much as they can for the child to nuture and care for them, and I was pleasantly surprised that there was such a distinction from another LFP school nearby, where the principal appeared disconnected.

It felt like a very safe space to put my child in. Thank you to your team for the hard work you do. I didn‚Äôt place my child in due to personal circumstances of my job, but If i ever  do intend to change my child‚Äôs school again- it will be wherever Angeline heads the school. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110104429916365942891/reviews

LittlePandaxxmao,5,"I would like to thank all the teachers, especially Li Laoshi and Teacher Selva for their dedication, support and caring towards my son, Eiden. My son enjoys going to school and now he is self confident. His communication and writing skills have greatly improved. He is able to read and write the Chinese words. Even now he is able to communicate in English as compared to before. Keep it up with the weekly reading homework because it is very good to reinforce the lesson and skills learntüí™.

Happy Teachers day! ‚ù§Ô∏è",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108163171429647061020/reviews
