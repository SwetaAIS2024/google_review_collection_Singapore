To my surprise, the staff provided a top tier service. Made an appointment online and I received a confirmation call almost immediately. Then I walked in again without knowing it was their lunch time. The receptionist was very kind and assure me that, it was fine to make enquiries. She happily stopped having her lunch and provided all the informations that I needed.\n\nThen comes my appointment day, Dr Amy provided a thorough checkup and advised me accordingly. We proceeded with the cleaning and multiple filling services. She was very gentle throughout the whole process. The staff who assisted her was very helpful. I will bring my children there to see Dr Amy soon.",
