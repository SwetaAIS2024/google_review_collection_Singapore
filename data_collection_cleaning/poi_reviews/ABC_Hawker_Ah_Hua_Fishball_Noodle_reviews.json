I realised it had shuttered its doors.\nWent with ABC Ah Hua fishball noodle instead persuaded by the long queue. I ordered a small version at $3 and added $1.20 for 2 meat balls.\nNot bad to be honest. The mee kia was doused generously with vinegar. The meat and fish balls were handmade.",

This is a specialist fish ball noodle stall, not a ‘Bak Cho’ mee stall. Hence, I wouldn’t recommend the mee pok. The fish balls are great! Order a $4 portion at least!",
