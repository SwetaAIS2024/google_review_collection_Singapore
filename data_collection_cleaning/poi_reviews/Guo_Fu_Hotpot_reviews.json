There are two options available: a one-time payment for buffet-style steamboat, or a set meal.\nFor beverages, we opted for the free-flow option, priced at $2.90 or $3.90. The pricing also includes a sauce bar, similar to HDLâ€™s setup.\nWe chose the set meals (come with individual hotpot) and ended up paying $38.60+ per person.\nThe environment is cozy, making it a great spot for large group gatherings.",

Instead of the buffet (which had a wide spread which comes at a higher cost), we opted for the set menu. It came with generous servings of meat, veg and noodles. Very satisfying.",

The ingredients are good and fresh,  xiaolongbao was yummy. There were sides like fried mantou with condensed milk and the scallion pancake as well, but wasnâ€™t really a fan of the fried banana fritter. Lucky that we came when thereâ€™s an anniversary promo. Will definitely come back again.",

Service is generally prompt and attentive but can see some of the staff are quite new so they might take a while to figure out whatâ€™s going on. Overall still a decent dining experience if the place is not too crowded.",
