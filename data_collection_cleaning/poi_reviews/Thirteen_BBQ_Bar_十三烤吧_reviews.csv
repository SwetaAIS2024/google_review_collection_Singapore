Lee Kokliang,3,"The $18 辣子鸡is fantastic as per many comments. Only meat, no bones. The portion is not that big. We tried the $33 嘛辣烤鱼. The fish is not seabass but more than river fish, lots of meat, few bones. Added $3.50 of cabbage, but portion is again small. But the mala sauce is super salty. I mean really really salty. I had to drink many glasses of water when we reached home. The atmosphere is excellent, not noisy, easy to talk. Background Chinese pop music is audible.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104409385181153062280/reviews

JK,4,"Nice and clean place, pretty quiet when we arrived. Service was prompt and efficient.

Food wise was good, though some of the dishes were a little on the saltier side. Skewers were okay, though the underlying taste of the meats were not as apparent and overwhelmed by the seasoning a little.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115355910486026677704/reviews
