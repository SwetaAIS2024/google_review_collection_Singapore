Rayner Lim,4,"Overall, staff were very friendly, the satay was average size, but tastes good. Peanut sauce with 30% pineapple tastes light, some might find it watery. Ketupat more on the mushy side. Still a nice satay in the neighborhood",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103361797835232610240/reviews
Ursa Major,3,"The name of the stall is a bit of a misnomer as the satay here follows the Singaporean Chinese way of preparing and serving satay as opposed to how the Balinese do it, which has typically thicker skewers served with sambal along with peanut gravy.

I tried both the pork and chicken satays, which were both going for 90 cents per skewer. The pork ones were basically super juicy pork belly, marinated to perfection and grilled with a nice char, but the chicken skewers were a bit on the small side for the price.

I loved that they used pineapple in their gravy just like how Hainanese satay sellers used to do it in the old days.I was also thankful how the ketupat was wrapped in coconut leaves instead of a ketupat shaped plastic wrap.

Definitely worth checking out if you're nearby, but if you're looking for the best value, go for the pork satay.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108566816051365753123/reviews
Katherine Happiest,4,"Had pork satay
Cost 90cents per stick
The meat was lean, seasoned just nice, not overly salty.

I enjoyed the sauce, spicy level and the pineapple on top was nice to my liking",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103056298337699105255/reviews
Super Fragrance,4,"Order 5 of each meat plus 3 pork belly. Normal meat is 80¢ per pop while pork belly is $1.60. Total is $16.80. Waiting time rather short. Less than 15min.

Godly
Tenderness and juiciness of meat. Mutton is toughest but I find it acceptable. But all are very juicy.

Pro
Peanut sauce with lime. Nice value added dimensions to the otherwise slightly below average peanut sauce. Peanut bits were on the finer side. Also peanut sauce can be served in styrofoam cup rather than styrofoam bowl. It makes more sense, try it if you are reading this.

Char taste of meat was great. Especially the pork belly. However I feel that it might not be worth twice the price. Don't get me wrong it does taste better but not at $1.60?

Meh
Taste. All meat were quite mild in taste even when not downing it with the already mild peanut sauce.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
K Y,1,"Have been patronizing this stall since they first opened. Years later after their business gotten better, the bosses hired staff to mend the counter and grill the satay. Satay still tastes about the same as last time when the bosses grill. However the counter staff service is ridiculous rude and inflexible(even for walk ins).  I will stop patronizing this stall from now onwards. We are here just to order happy satay not to eat the counter’s staff anger.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118158283770500923797/reviews
