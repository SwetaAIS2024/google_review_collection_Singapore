Zhen Teng,5,"Review of The Terrace canteen:
One of the nicest place to hangout when in NUS! The canteen is clean and modern, with plenty of seats to study at. The ordering system is advanced. You can even order and pay for food through your phone before collecting it(without feeling bad for the people queueing, because everybody sits to wait for their food anyway). Most importantly, the pao fan is insane. Tried the pork pao fan and the soup was full of seafood flavor, just insane. Their teh and kopi are also strong, while being sweet enough!

To be fair some other food items are lacklustre, however the comfort of the place(and the pao fan) makes up for it!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113388837756517821208/reviews
Edwin S,5,"COM3 is the newest building for NUS School of Computing. It is served by a new bus stop at COM3 (served by NUS ISB D1). It, however, is accessible from the COM2 bus stop (served by NUS ISB A1 and A2).

The building houses the all-new Terrace canteen, as well as other cafes, like Yole and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.

As for the Terrace canteen, it is of a slightly different concept from the other NUS canteens. The ordering is done through one cashier (or the multiple self-ordering kiosks) and the food is served from the different ‘stalls’.

There are a variety of food - mixed vegetable rice, ramen, noodles, vegetarian, mala, and fried rice. I have tried several items for now:
1. Mixed vegetable rice - The food items are set (displayed on the screens) and it is served more of a bento style as compared to the usual ‘mix everything on the plate’. I have tried over several visits and the food is generally tasty and quite reasonably priced. Some dishes, like the sliced pork with ginger onion and the dried shrimp long beans, are particularly good.

2. Mala Pot - The mala here sells mala dishes on a set. The set A consists of pork belly, pork balls, and vegetables (lotus root, potato, cabbage, mushroom, enoki). You also get instant noodles. The mild spicy is quite good -- very little spiciness, but still fragrant.

3. Toasts - The toast is quite good. The bread is crispy and is slathered with a choice of Nutella, Peanut Butter, or Kaya Butter (different prices). The first two are good, but for the kaya butter, I would have liked it better if more butter was given.

4. Noodles & Ramen - The Ban Mian was good. The soup was very tasty and the noodles were cooked to a right consistency. The portion of the meat was quite generous too.

Their offerings have considerably increased since their first opening.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113192406653516830642/reviews
