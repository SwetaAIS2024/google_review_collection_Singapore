Last time ordering anything from this place.\n\nOrdered Tom Yum soup with Rice for $8 and was expecting something similar to the picture.\n\nWhat came was a bowl of red oil (see photos)\nCouldn't find any prawns so brought it back to the lady manning. She stirred around and dug up a tiny shrimp and told me \"there\".\nWas totally disgusted by the attitude of the staff. Unfriendly and rude.\n\nThat bowl of \"Tom Yum\" came with 2 tiny shrimps, Kang kong, baby corn, carrots, some squid pieces and 1 piece of fish. Suspect the chef and owner has never had Tom Yum soup before.\n\nGoodness...",

      "text": "Happen to come here for dinner after our fishing trip. They were willing to cook our fishes provided if it was scaled and cleaned for an additional cost. We ordered some of their dishes to go with our meal as well. The deep fried yam sticks, stir fried veges and prawns with melon were ok. The fried chicken was tasty and crispy but slightly dry. Our fried little fishes were slightly under cooked, the teochew style steam fish was nice and tasty but fish was over cooked, so was the squid cooked with garlic and soy sauce. They overcooked the squid and it became tough to chew. It was a rather disappointing meal. As a neighbourhood zi char serving food to the people around here, I hope they will improve the standards of their cooking.",

The frontline staff has serious attitude problem - rude, not helpful and pulled a long, black face when we asked for a table for 8 pax. Definitely worse than a cleaner auntie who tried her best to help us as most of the bigger tables had “Reserved” sign on them. The food was okay but please don’t do any promotions if your staff are ready for it!",
