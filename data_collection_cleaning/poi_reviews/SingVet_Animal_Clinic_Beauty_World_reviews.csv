Ponyo,5,"I just wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt appreciation to the incredible team at SingVet Beauty World, especially to Dr. Jody and the wonderful nurses (sorry, I didn‚Äôt manage to catch their names).

I brought my timid chihuahua Ponyo in for her spay on March 24, 2025, and I couldn‚Äôt be more impressed with the entire process. From the start, the nurses were not only friendly but also incredibly kind and informative. Their cheerful and reassuring nature made us feel completely at ease.

A huge thank you to Dr. Jody, who took such great care of our little one. You truly know you‚Äôre in good hands when your dog experiences no pain at all. My pup was running and jumping around like nothing ever happened, just hours after the surgery!

It‚Äôs now day 3 after the procedure, and I‚Äôm absolutely amazed by how quickly she‚Äôs healing‚Äîthe wound is already 80% healed! Dr. Jody also took the time to personally explain everything to us when we picked up our pup, and they even provided a detailed, personalized post-surgery care guide. Talk about going above and beyond!

I‚Äôve already recommended this vet to all my fellow pawrents. Thank you so much, SingVet Beauty World!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113257092582849703424/reviews
Sheree,5,"I wanna express my gratitude to Dr Teo JiaWen. Yesterday was my first visit with my 13 year old dog, coco. Due to a disappointing session with our previous vet, we decided to seek for a second opinion. Dr Teo was gentle & patient with coco and gave us a proper closure.

Coco passed away peacefully after ü§ç thank you Dr Teo and team for slotting coco in last minute & giving us the support we needed.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104943584933338107889/reviews
Sharlene Tan,5,"It was my first time at SingVet, but it is an experience that I will always remember. My very senior dog was at his end-stage of life. It is very heartbreaking to see him cross the rainbow bridge but throughout the entire time, Dr Charmaine and nurse Shima showed so much empathy and provided so much support. It felt this was not just a vet business but they truly understood how we felt. They did little things such as taking paw prints of my dog for the last time and writing a card. I truly appreciate all they have done and would recommend this clinic to all pet owners. It has been almost a month now, and I just wanted to leave a note here to thank them for all the kindness they have given us.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101689807378585258259/reviews
Stacey L,5,"Really lovely doctors and vet techs here. It's obvious that they put the needs of the animals first. The clinic is very clean and the team is upfront about the fees, which by the way are highly reasonable. Definitely recommend signing up for Care Club!

Kudos to Dr Liew for carrying out a very smooth sterilization surgery for my dog, plus amazing dental scaling work! Also a huge shout-out to Dr Hannah for being ever so patient and reassuring each time my dog steps into the clinic. :)",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112036798650017979669/reviews
