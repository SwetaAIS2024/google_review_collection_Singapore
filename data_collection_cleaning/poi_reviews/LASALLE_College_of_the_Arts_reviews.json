      "text": "The art school building is absolutely breathtaking, almost like something straight out of Westworld, which was actually filmed there. Its futuristic and one-of-a-kind design makes it well worth a visit. Unfortunately, the experience was spoiled by a rude security guard who insisted that sitting was completely forbidden—no benches, no steps, nowhere at all. So, if you're just passing through and hoping to take in the sights, don’t count on being able to sit and relax for even a moment.",

      "text": "As a visitor to Singapore, I found LASALLE College of the Arts by chance and was captivated by its architecture.  I explored the exterior and took a number of photos, but could not explore inside.\n\nDesigned by Singapore-based RSP Architects, the campus is an ingenious exercise of reworking space. From the outside, visitors are confronted by a black monolithic exterior of stone and aluminium punctuated with irregularly-shaped windows.\n\nThis illusion of continuity disappears when visitors enter the building, with its six seven-storey-high buildings, linked by an atrium and sky bridges. In contrast to its exterior, the buildings here are stunningly graphic, with faceted glass walls and individual panels framed in black, each tilting at different angles.",

However, at 11pm, a security guard came and rudely chased us away, even shining a torchlight on us. Since sitting there wasn’t allowed, we decided to leave.\n\nAs we were heading to the opposite street, we walked across the grass patch. The guard scolded us again, but we ignored him and continued crossing.\n\nIs there an issue with walking across the grass patch? If the school prohibits trespassing, shouldn’t there be clear signage indicating this?",
