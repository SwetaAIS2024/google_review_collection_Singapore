      "text": "This UOB ATM is located at the basement, on the further side of the mall. If you came into the mall from Orchard Road, you'd just have to go down the escalator, and keep walking towards where all the eatery options and Cold Storage CS Fresh is at, instead of going towards Din Tai Fung side.\n\nNot the easiest to find, and definitely not the most intuitive of locations to be finding an ATM. Especially when you compare this location to where the main big banks have their ATMs on the basement floor.",
