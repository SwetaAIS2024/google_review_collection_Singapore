You can find many insects especially butterflies in the late morning, monkeys, small birds, lizards commonly seen. Moths and bats and spiders are common sight at night, lucky enough you will see the rare slow loris, the civet cat, the flying squirrel and mousedeer. Visiting at night is not recommended with no street lighting in the area.",
