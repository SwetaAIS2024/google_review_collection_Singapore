L Wong,3,"Had lunch at the restaurant after peak hour yet service was very slow.  Food wise, the mango salad and seafood tomyam soup were good. The rest were rather disappointing. Personally I felt that the chilli sauces used to cook the fried fish (which was their promotion item for new member) and lady fingers do not blend well.  It has a weird after taste especially the sauce for the fish.  Luckily the sauces was served separately, thus we could still enjoy the crispy fried fish.  The prawns tanghoon was extremely oily, we could not finished the vermicelli as it was full of oil at the bottom of the bowl.
We tried their desserts chendol and tapioca, not really fantastic. If you are not fussy with the chendol ingredient's texture and the coconut milk, then you may find them acceptable.
The ambience is okay.  Good location to slowly enjoy the meal.
Perhaps next time we could try out other dishes which were given positive feedback!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105052490586738746635/reviews
Syahirah S,5,"Had our iftar here on a Saturday evening. The service was immaculate. They allowed us to order our food in advance before the time. Even informed us of the promotion and let us walk around before returning to have iftar. Additionally the food was tasty, very well portion and value for money. Would definitely come again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105874944602635024759/reviews
roberto suarez,2,"This is a place that I will not come back again. The price is way too high for the kind of food they serve. And the service was very slow. We almost finished our food before the main dish came out. The ice lemon tea was bitter and when we tried to ask for sugar, it took the waitress more than 5 minutes to serve it.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107936027613304776219/reviews
clive bixby,3,"Grilled chicken and noodle salad was good.

Garlic Honey chicken was too sweet, chicken was mostly batter and barely any meat.

Overall okay.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100239410133909454274/reviews
Yaznasri Divili,4,"I went for dinner with a friend and was pleased to find they offer a separate vegetarian menu. While the food took a bit longer to arrive, we enjoyed our drinks while waiting. The portions are generous and tasty, and Iâ€™d definitely return to try more dishes next time.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100672018844307843211/reviews
