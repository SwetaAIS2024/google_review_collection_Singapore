Huiling Huang,5,"A big shoutout to Coach Alvin Huang 🙌

You are truly a swimming superstar! When Samson and Kylo first started lessons, they were super scared of the water.
But thanks to your endless patience, cheerful energy, and fun teaching style, they have gone from nervous little dolphins to confident swimmers who can’t wait for each Saturday lessons! 🏊🏻‍♂️

Thank you for making learning so enjoyable~ 🥰
We are so lucky to have you as their coach! 🩵💙

Kudos to Coach Alvin Huang 👏
