Fajar Priyanto,5,"We found another perfect Indonesian bakso in this small food center at Joo Chiat. The stall name is Warung Sri Indonesia. It doesn't have its own google map entry so we write here.
They have 3 types of bakso: regular bakso $7, pelakor (with meat tofu) $8, and beranak (very big bakso with eggs inside) $9. The taste is exactly like in Indonesia. We love it. Don't forget to add their awesome chili to make it perfect and sweating :)
Friendly stall owner and staff too.
Highly recommended, it is definitely becomes our regular visits in the future.
P.S. the location is the food center may be confusing for first timer, go to Joo Chiat Complex, go the right look for Fairprice. Go straight and then left.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105379084393575160837/reviews
