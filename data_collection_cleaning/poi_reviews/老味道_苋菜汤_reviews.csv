Hrmgr,4,"Finally tried out this bitter gourd pig's Organs soup. I liked it as it was served with goji berry along with bitter gourd. Lots of pork slices, minced pork, liver, soft intestines, stomach in the soup for just $5.
The clear soup is good as it is a good mix especially not over shadowed by the smell from the pig's Organs.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews
SQ,4,"Quite expensive for a vegetable soup. The seafood option is probably the most value for money than the 3eggs soup option.

They give more century egg than salted egg if you order the 3eggs option. Like 80% century egg, 10% salted egg and 10%egg. The ratio is a bit imbalanced for me. So abit unsatisfying...

There's rice and noodles to add on to your soup. Extra 30cents if you dabao.

Queue can move quite slowly. Long queue during lunch time.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103631577837567007829/reviews
