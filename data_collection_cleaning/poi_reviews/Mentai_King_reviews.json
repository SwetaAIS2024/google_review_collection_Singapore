Garlic rice was hard and full of garlic bits which was not to my liking.\n\nThe main star, I.e. salmon was overcooked, resulting it to be hard and dry.\n\nI would say that this is a disappointing meal experience and will definitely be my first and last meal at this stall.",

The chicken came out different from what i expected from the images advertised.",

From the same boss of King of Fried Rice, Mentai King is the latest venture and if it achieves the same warm welcome of their previous DTF fried rice, you may find one a Mentaiko rice bowl near you. Their signature is the mental pork cutlet rice which is essentially a spin-off of the Fried Rice King's Signature pork fried rice but the focus is on the garlic flavoured Japanese rice.  The mentai Aburi also provides the umami they promised.",
