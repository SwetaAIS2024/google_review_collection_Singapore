Melissa Wu,2,"Nice looking cafe but horrible drinks.. we ordered three drinks and all were bad. Barely drank the drinks and left. A shame cos the drinks were decently priced ~$5 range.

Matcha Latte: Milk was over-frothed and wayyyyy too sweet. 150% sugar?? Tasted like 3-in-1 plus more sugar.

Left 2 stars instead of 1 star cos we didn’t try their food so we’re not sure if they are good or bad. It’s a waste as the cafe has good ambience with cute swings.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115099526592888059804/reviews
Charmaine Lam,4,"Mushroom soup is creamy and mushroomy. Rock honey chicken is well grilled. Portion size is value for money. Salmon bowl is flavoured well. Quite many options to choose from the menu (rice bowls, burgers, all day breakfast, western mains). Cozy place.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114305082875982087442/reviews

JMok_ 7,4,This place is so nice. The guy at the counter is so friendly and kind as he waited for me to withdraw cash. He doesn’t treat me bad and doesn’t see me as a secondary school student. Just a normal customer which is sooo kind of him omfg he should deserve to get a raise I ordered the gay rainbow cake and the chicken chop and the food I nice too but gotta be honest the meals are quite expensive like what’s up with halal restaurants being so expensive? Do people not know how to do business is it. If the food is cheap people would want to come here every single day compared to price so damn expensive and little to no people coming here,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106897997108443342606/reviews
