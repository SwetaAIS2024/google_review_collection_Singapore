Di Di,3,"My children and I went into the restaurant for a quick meal. I told to them to find themselves seats, while I went to the counter to order food. Just when I was ordering food, I turned to see that someone was talking to them, apparently to ask if they have gotten themselves food from the cafe. It was only like a less than one minute that they were seated and there were so many empty tables. Fortunately, they knew how to point towards me. My sons commented that the baked rice tasted better home-cooked. The chocolate yogurt sultana reeked a rancid oil smell and the oil had seeped through the paper bag when I left the zoo after two hours.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
Jamie Li,3,"Was looking for brunch options and decided to check out this cafe. The mac & cheese is yummy, baked nicely, but portion is not big. Coffee not bad just that hot version is bit small cup. Sandwiches toasted just nice. Price wise i would say ok, close to neighborhood cafe pricing",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109714820871031446527/reviews

Siok-koon Lee,5,"This cafe is a gem find at the bird paradise. Food is freshly prepared (we had the egg croissant and latte - the egg mayo is delicious! It comes with a salad with juicy heirloom tomatoes and spinach leaves - well worth the price of the food) and the service staff are able to provide explanations about food when we had questions.

The farmers market in the shop provided a good browse and the children playground just next to the cafe was a good find for the kid.

It’s also a social enterprise :)",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108225156776841489186/reviews
