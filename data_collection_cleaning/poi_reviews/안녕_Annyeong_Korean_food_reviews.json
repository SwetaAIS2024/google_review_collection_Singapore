      "text": "very disappointing experience. The food here is overpriced and service is very slow (waited at least 30mins) for our food and shop is not even busy.\nKimbap tasted normal for the price paid. Fish cake soup is a little blend, it taste like those fish ball soup from hawker centre. Paid 8.50 for Spicy tteokbokki and portion is pathetic with little sauce.\n\nfor reference, we ordered chicken cheese sausage kimbap (beef bulgogi kimbap (both $12.50 each) spicy tteokbokki ($8.50), fish cake soup ($4.50) multigrain drink ($6.50).\n\nOverall, i would not revisit or recommend this place to others",

      "text": "This little gem that sells one of the best kimbaps in Singapore is quietly located in at Cluny court, a stone throw from botanical gardens mrt.\n\nThe stall itself is relatively small, located by the roadside, and has pretty limited seating. Would advise to takeaway instead.\n\nHaving tried all of their kimbaps, I would recommend the cheese sausage and tuna kimbaps.. However, I would go to the extent of saying that all of them are delicious. Their kimbap is well wrapped, the ingredients fresh and complement each other very well.\n\nTheir sides and beverage are not to be dismissed either. Their fishcake soup is umami and addictive, and their korean multi grain drink provided a unique experience.\n\nWould highly recommend a visit for the kimbap, EVEN if it's out of your way. 11/10.",

Perhaps it's more for takeaway.  Nevertheless, the rolls are really delicious.  Live the no-rice  option.  They use egg instead. The filling is a lot, the ingredients in the rolls are well cooked, and it's soft and tender.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  They spent time recommending their popular dishes and turned out as expected.",

Maybe it’s due to the high 4.9 stars review that I had high expectations.\n\nThe egg was dry, chicken was hard, taste was average and serving was small for the price.\n\nIt’s also more of a takeout kiosk with very uncomfortable seats outside.\n\nOverall, it’s very average.",
