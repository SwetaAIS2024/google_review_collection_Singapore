Sudhir SB,4,Cold Storage Jelita is a perfect place if you need some medicines and supplements as Guardian is located on the second floor and has quite a wide range of products. Although the branch is not bug but you can get the necessary stuff for daily use.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105586838995884226224/reviews
Christopher Kwek,5,24hr Cold Storage supermarket. Convenient to get all the necessary groceries throughout the whole day. Meats are generally pretty good quality here. All other things easily available in Cold Storage and quite reasonable prices for some products even when compared to other supermarkets,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114751325811782242813/reviews
Joe Ng,3,"This is a Guardian pharmacy outlet at Jelita.  It is not part of the Cold Storage supermarket which is on level one.  Be sure to call ahead to make sure they have the meds you need as not all Guardians will carry the full inventory.  This is a neighborhood outlet, and the pharmacist is sometimes not around, so be sure to call to make sure you're not making a trip in vain for meds that they don't carry or to find the pharmacist out to lunch or a break.  Otherwise, the retail offerings are pretty standard.  If you can't get meds here, you might check at Guardian Holland Village 5 minutes away.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109434159714049459136/reviews
