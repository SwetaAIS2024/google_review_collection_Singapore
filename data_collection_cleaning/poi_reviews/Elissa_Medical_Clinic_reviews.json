He is one of the rudest Dr with lack of mannerism I have seen in any clinic I’ve been to. He is totally not attentive towards all concerns raise. He raised his voice towards us when we asked question. He frowns a lot and keep passing remarks each time we answer his question. I seriously do not want to see him if he ever run the clinic again.",
