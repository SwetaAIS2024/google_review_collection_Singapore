Hai Peng Lam,4,"Packed their freshly cooked Black Carrot Cake home for dinner. The surface of the black carrot cake was crispy and the interior soft and very flavorful with black soya sauce and a tinge of spiciness. Every mouthful brought me closer to heaven. I was extremely satisfied. Will come back often from now on.

I enjoyed it so much I forgot to take a photo of the Black Carrot Cake before I completely finished every bit of it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118395190886911771500/reviews
Kayden N,5,"One of the better carrot cake stalls I’ve had in the east side..very crispy on the outside yet the carrot cake is super tender in the middle. Always wondered why they had such a long queue every morning..Talked to the owner and apparently they make their own Chili and oil (there’s lard inside which isn’t common nowadays since most hawkers fry to cut costs by using vegetable oil instead). And it’s super affordable (starts at only $3) and portions are generous!!
This is a MUST try if you’re in the area looking for a good breakfast in the mornings.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107969436789747627490/reviews
Bosen Teh,5,"The carrot cake(Chinese style one) was good. Ordered black. Never tried this before but since we have been looking for good carrot cake to eat after our drone flight, we decided to have a go. Those in the area who are interested in carrot cake should also give it a try. Would go back again to try white one.
The aunty works very fast.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110239282316938049173/reviews
Chinese Moon,5,"Always a crowd pleaser, this carrot cake comes with both black and white, called Othello.  Tastes good, though missing lard umami.  Highly recommended due to generous portion and nice service.  Chili could have more oomph, so if you want to taste chili, please ask for more.  Stall is usually manned single-handedly, so be patient as each order is done separately.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106735384857518209558/reviews
