I address her nicely ‚Äú aunty do you know where is the item‚Äù and she replied me rudely ‚Äú do not call me aunty! We are not related ! Call me ma‚Äôam ! ‚Äú this is not how u serve customer ! I understand some people are sensitive to the word ‚Äú aunty ‚Äú and I do apologise but however she is old enough to be my grandmother about 60+ and I‚Äôm 20+ not rude to call her aunty. and that is definitely not how you would talk to people especially we are not related like what she said. She shouldn‚Äôt raise her voice ! bad bad bad service. Thumbs down do not recommend. And is not helpful at all compared to another Chinese lady helpful and cheerful lady. So everyone please beaware if you don‚Äôt want to get scream at in the morning ! ruined my day",
