      "text": "Be cautious of possible deceptive practices at the cai fan stall (#S02) by Unicuz.\n\nI bought 狮子头 ($2) from the stall, but the female server claimed it contained fish and charged $3. Upon returning home, I found no fish in it. I went back to the stall for clarification.\n\nThe female server returned the extra $1 without an apology, insisting it wasn’t her fault and blaming a mix-up by someone else. Her dismissive attitude made it unclear whether it was a genuine mistake or intentional deception.\n\nTL;DR: The cai fan stall provided incorrect information and overcharged for food. Beware of potential dishonest behavior.",
