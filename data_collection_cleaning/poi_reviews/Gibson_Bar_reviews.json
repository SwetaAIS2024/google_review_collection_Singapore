However, the attentive staff guided us to the first floor, which turned out to be an even more fitting and comfortable spot for us.\n\nThe ambiance on the upper floor was exceptional, and the artistry in the presentation of the cocktails was truly remarkable. It proved to be an ideal venue for socializing with friends, offering an enjoyable and memorable evening.\n\nCocktails were priced at S$28++, reflecting the premium experience.",

      "text": "There's really nothing not to love about Gibson. Service was beyond phenomenal with literally every breathing person working there genuinely being smiley and hospitable. That definitely made us stay on longer than we planned to! The staff were so prompt and attentive with constantly topping up our refreshing green teas (they serve GTs instead of water).  The cocktails were great and varied, and packed a punch. Very interesting concept and quite a fancy yet chill vibe. I would recommend reservations, especially on weekends, just cause there's limited seating. But a must-visit.",

      "text": "Tucked away along Bukit Pasoh Road, Gibson is a hidden gem that delivers an intimate cocktail experience with real personality.\n\nThis small, cozy bar is dimly lit and effortlessly stylish - perfect for good conversations over great drinks. The atmosphere is calm and welcoming, ideal for small groups or a quiet nightcap.  The menu is thoughtfully laid out: a quick overview on a single page in a 6x3 grid of drink profiles, followed by beautifully detailed pages diving into each cocktail — a format reminiscent of Jigger & Pony, which makes sense, as they're from the same group.\n\nCocktails here are inventive, with a well-curated range of alcohol strengths. I tried:\n• Apple & Roses - light, fruity, and floral, a gentle sipper.\n• Yuzu Miso Sour - crisp and refreshing, with a bright yuzu note that hits just right.\n• Melon Tango - bold and aromatic, with a punchy melon profile that stands out.\n\nShoutout to Gabriel, who was warm, attentive, and went the extra mile to create a bespoke drink when we mentioned we were celebrating a birthday - such a thoughtful touch that made the night even more special.\n\nWhether you're a cocktail connoisseur or just in the mood for something new, Gibson offers a curated, comfortable escape in the heart of the city.",

It was like a really good & rich sangria⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\n🥭 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐨 𝐏𝐗⁣⁣⁣\nFlavours of mango and cognac were both distinct, with what seemed to be PX sherry as well. There was also a piece of chocolate stuck on the outside of the glass, that was yummy too⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\n🍎 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐬 & 𝐑𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐬⁣⁣⁣\nWe all felt that this was the easiest cocktail to drink that night, with this tasting like slightly alcoholic apple juice. It was good but the other cocktails were better⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\n🍋 𝐘𝐮𝐳𝐮 𝐌𝐢𝐬𝐨 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐫⁣⁣⁣\nAlways love myself a good sour, and I personally liked this version at Gibson more than the one at Jigger. Probably because I could taste more of the yuzu and miso elements in here⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\n🍺 𝐑𝐨𝐨𝐭 𝐁𝐞𝐞𝐫 𝐎𝐥𝐝 𝐅𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐝 ⁣⁣⁣\nIf you’ve seen my posts, you’d know that I’m not an old fashioned type of girlie, but my friends really enjoyed this with the hints of root beer and savoury cheese cracker garnish⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\nWe also tried a couple of food items which were all very great—favourites are starred 😊⁣⁣\n🦪 𝐎𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 - $6/$8 each⁣⁣\n🧀 ‘𝐂𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐨 𝐄 𝐏𝐞𝐩𝐞’ 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐩𝐬 - $9⁣⁣\n✨🦀 𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐛 & 𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐬 - $15 ⁣⁣\n✨🫑 𝐓𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐫𝐚 𝐒𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐨 𝐏𝐞𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬 - $16⁣⁣\n🦑 𝐒𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐝 𝐓𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐫𝐚 - $17⁣\n⁣⁣\nWould totally come back to Gibson again to try the other cocktails, and also the Filet-O-Halibut that my friend raved about!
