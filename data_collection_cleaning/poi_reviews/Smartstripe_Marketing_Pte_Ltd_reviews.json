The quality of their cards exceeded expectations ‚Äî sharp printing, excellent material, and aligned with sustainable practices too. It‚Äôs clear they care about both their craft and their clients. Highly recommend!",

Will never recommend\n\nRe: Yes due to pdpa.\nInteraction was with a staff from your sales team mainly made via calls, emails will indicate otherwise - very strategic. So, there were no paper or email trials for your investigation. Perhaps this is why it has been unnoticed by your management.\nAppreciate your team reaching out, however, we cannot condone such practices with our vendors.\nHopefully improvements will be made.",
