Matilda Lim,5,"They used to be at Toa Payoh before moving to Serangoon and closing abruptly in 2022. They have recently reopened at Novena Regency.

Signature dishes such as their Flaming Chicken and Lala Crispy Hor Fun still can be found on their menu. Theatrical moment when rose wine is pour down the chicken and flambé in front of us, after which the server withh bring it away to be dissected. The chicken was tender and moist and you can smell the fragrance of the wine on the the chicken skin. Hearsay from our dear friend Kelvin Kuek who just had the Flaming Chicken a few days ago at another restaurant, Yalong Bay's version was much more tender.

Lala Crispy Hor Fun was full of wok hei. Adding the crispy hor fun provided different texture in the dish. The rest of the dishes was all above average, the only downside is the restaurant is tiny. Probably can fit 3-4 tables only and some tables scatter outside the restaurant so be sure to make a reservation if you are going in a big group .",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104279112810113355814/reviews
Cedric Seet,5,"Been eating this for awhile before it even moved here. Their signature fried yuan yang hor fun is a must try. Large servings with generous portions of lala inside. The deep fried hor fun gives it a special kick that I love.

The other dishes were no pushovers too. They tasted great, har cheong gai had a lot of prawny taste which is not as commonly found anymore.

While trio eggs spinach was tasty, spinach did not have a raw taste to it and the broth was exceptional.

Will definitely come back.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116120424406667932678/reviews

C S,5,"Grandparents have missed this restaurant, last time they ate was before COVID. This restaurant has moved quite a bit and finally we’re able to eat again in the new location. Quality of food is still there and the same. They enjoyed the ‘fire chicken’ as it was tender and juicy. Picture does not show the real fire as I took it after it cooled down. Hope to come back more often, tables are a bit limited so best to call in advance and book. Can’t wait to try more of their food as there is so much variety and every dish ordered did not disappoint. Food is really good. The lao ban niang is also very hospitable and my grandparents enjoyed talking to her.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100949760937596920244/reviews
Jack Tan,5,"We passed by sometime back and decided to have our dinner here today.
The restaurant lady owner has operated the restaurant for many years, and has moved to this new location recently.
It has an old school vibe and the staffs are very friendly too.
We ordered prawn paste fried chicken wings, home made tofu and mixed vegetables.
The dishes are very delicious and reminded us of home cooked food.
And no service charge and GST.
We will definitely come back again.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101959647575374908444/reviews
