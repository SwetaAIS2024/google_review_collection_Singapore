The competition pool here is different from the pools in other swimming complex as there are 9 lanes and the two ends are 1.2m and 1.5m deep. (Most other pools have 8 lanes and both ends are 1.2m deep.) The water level is also a foot lower than the edge, necessitating the use of the ladder or very strong arms to get out.",
