Ant Oink,3,"One of the places I did not visit while lodging-hopping earlier in the year. Update- re-adding the photo that accompanied this review, as it looks like the photo did not make it in the post. Will remove if duplicates surface.
Updated- rating updated because, well, I've never been here.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110839689448540729974/reviews
Jenna Joa,4,"Location is great, its about a two minute walk to all the food and souviners. And a 7 minute walk to the Chinatown train station.
The room amongst 12 people isn't the biggest, or roomiest but livable. This place is really just so you can have a roof over your head at night, but beds are sturdy and comfy!
Not much socializing or anything to do at this hostel.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108294461296647294474/reviews
Caitlin Weich,3,"This place was not very clean, and did not include breakfast as advertised. They did let me check in early though, and allowed bags to be left in the lockers if there was nobody in the bed the next day. Location is great, really close to the Buddha Tooth Relic temple and Chinatown.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117997908359174806438/reviews
Toni Llopis,2,"It is not a really nice place!! But cant ask for anything better for that price. The location is really awesome. You have all the night life 5 min away and there are many chinesse restaurants around.
Location is the best.
Beds are no so good, but enough.",10 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100920340725000568962/reviews
Bing Xuan Ho,2,"Receptionist out for break when we arrived, no one there to serve us. With the help of a friendly guest, we managed to call the receptioist, only to find out that the hostel is full and she transferred us to another nearby dormitory, although we made the booking through Agoda and we didn't receive any prior notification. Anyway, there are tables and chairs for guests to chill despite it's quite a small hostel.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106843166756572594425/reviews
