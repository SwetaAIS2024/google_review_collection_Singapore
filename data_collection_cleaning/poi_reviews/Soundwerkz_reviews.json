Pricing is very reasonable for the quality of work and the boss Kelvin gives very helpful advise on options available for any given issue. His workshop guys are also all very knowledgable and great at what they do. Nothing beats knowing that good quality of work is done on the car and that peace of mind goes a long way.",

      "text": "I was looking for a sound system upgrade for my 10 year old car and got to know about Soundwerkz through my car mechanic. Soundwerkz has a rather professional looking shop frontage and it did cross my mind whether the prices here will be out of budget.\n\nDefinitely, the prices are not the cheapest out there in the market, but here are a few reason why I think you should really consider soundwerkz nonetheless:\n\n1. They suggest and provide quality sound system that change the entire listening experience in the car. These speaker are not cheap to begin with, even if you buy them yourself online.\n2. The staff at soundwerkz are not at all pushy and they try their best to share their knowledge on the sound systems so that you know what you are buying.\n3. Kelvin, the boss is very accommodating to provide adjustments the sound system of the car to suit the tastes of the individual. For some, this part can get quite frustrating for some because you find yourself returning to the shop on multiple occasions to make those changes. However, for me, its all part and parcel of the process of getting the best experience. After all, you do want to get the bang for your buck right?\n4. The workmanship of the shop is top-notch. You might think - ohh its just installing speakers what? Isn't it all the same? Maybe I'm \"suay\" (unlucky) la, but I've encountered many installers that leave wires hanging and dangling in the most convenient places for them. What this results in is intermittent rattling (especially once your car gets older) and you really have no idea where all these is coming from! Saving that bit of money only to result in a bigger headache later on is not worth it. Also, if you encounter installers that are not experienced in opening your car's body panels, you might end up with broken clips (which most would say - \"oh its already spoilt\").\n5. Kelvin and his team went beyond to help me resolve some sound issues that were not related to the installation of the sound system and I really appreciate him for that.\n\nOverall, I am impressed with the quality of service they provide and I'm just surprised that they only have 10 reviews. In a nutshell, Soundwerkz is not the cheapest out there but if you are particular about your car, like me, I would highly recommend them. You will not regret it.",
