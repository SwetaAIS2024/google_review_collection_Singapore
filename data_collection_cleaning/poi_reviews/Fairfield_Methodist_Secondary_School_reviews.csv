Naomi Liu Hor Mei (Fmss),5,The teachers and students are dedicated to do their job. The students are friendly and they always make the school environment fun to be in. I appreciate their efforts in making going to school seem enjoyable. The events they planned for us had been put with a lot of effort and love.
