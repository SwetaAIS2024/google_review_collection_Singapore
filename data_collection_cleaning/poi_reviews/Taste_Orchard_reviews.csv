Elizabeth Jhack,5,"Recently heard about this new mall and decided to visit. Very interesting concept as the mall has a supermarket from B1 to level 2.

Currently they have a wide selection of trendy eateries ranging from Korean, Japanese, local and western food.

Noticed an optician shop and a tuition center upstairs, but most parts of the upper level are not ready yet. But so far it has a very homely and calm atmosphere. Can’t wait to see what it will be like when it’s all done!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108928716374492254215/reviews
Cheryl,1,"Very disappointed! ☹️ Specially came all the way here, and waited from 4pm until 5pm. but turns out nobody is manning the store. Had to get information from cashier from another store to know that the staff is on leave today and tomorrow 30th and 31st August. No information was displayed at the counter pertaining to this unavailability. Still has big big banner all over the mall showing and promoting this buffet.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108157037330115356943/reviews

Happy to get Tokyo’s beloved chocolate boutique, Magie du Chocolat, here in Singapore! Known for its artisanal creations and luxurious presentation, this Japanese brand has taken chocolate-making to the next level!! Trust me, this is not your average chocolate box.  One bite, and you’ll understand why it’s called ""Magie.""

Each piece is handcrafted with care, making the experience feel just as premium as the taste. It’s a flavour journey across textures, from creamy and smooth to crunchy and chewy — a true treat for the senses.

Featuring
Milk Pistachio – Creamy, nutty, and irresistibly smooth

Almond Crunch – A satisfying snap with every bite

Coffee Blend – Bold, aromatic, and perfect for caffeine lovers

Milk Caramel – Rich, buttery caramel wrapped in silky chocolate

Happy to get Canelé de CHIANT, a canelé specialty store hailing from Niigata, Japan here. Crafted by a modern Italian chef with a patisserie background, these canelés are meticulously made, with each flavour created from scratch.

You can’t go wrong with a traditional canele, but de Chianti has more flavours including matcha, honey lemon cheese, coconut, salted caramel, black sesame, early grey and even saikyo miso!!!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109173464175521287422/reviews
L. A_#,5,"This used to house the OG departmental store. It has now been converted into Hao Mart Excellente Orchard and has many food outlets on the ground floor.

There is also a wine cellar cum bar where u can purchase alcohol by the bottle or by glass and enjoy it there. Like normal supermarkets, there is a fresh seafood and meat section. However, they also provide cooking service at $12 per portion if you wish to consume it there.

Entrance to the carpark is via Koek Road (behind the building)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102480254251724083087/reviews
