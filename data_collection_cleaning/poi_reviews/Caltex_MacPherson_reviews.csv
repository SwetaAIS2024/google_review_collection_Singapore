R,2,"I had a very disappointing experience at this petrol station, which put me in a bad mood:

1. It was raining when I arrived, yet the petrol attendant remained seated and was using a handphone instead of offering assistance promptly, even though I had parked at the pump.

2. After making payment via the Caltex app and driving off, I was stopped by the same attendant, who accused me of not paying. Although an apology was given, it did not make up for the inconvenience and wasted time.

3. To make matters worse, the air pump at the station was out of order, forcing me to drive to a nearby SPC station to pump my tyres.

Considering this poor service, I will avoid this location in the future and visit the Serangoon Caltex station instead.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105971350283339314614/reviews
