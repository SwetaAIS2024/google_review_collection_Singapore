Anna Ellie,5,"Decided to try out this coffee place as they had some interesting coffee from their menu. Staff recommended their popular coconut latte which surprisingly does not have a strong coconut taste, it’s not bad. I do prefer their Spanish black latte more though. The cafe was pretty chill and quiet in the afternoon, and the interior is pretty unique which kind off makes me feel like I’m in an st gallery 😆 Staff was polite as well",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101222681494986618069/reviews
宜羚Yee Lin,5,"My favourite cafe. I like the space, it is calm and conducive for me to be in my zone. I like to sit at the side of the window, and breathe through the scene from outside.

Highly recommend!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101164386754460087782/reviews
Gator,4,"Had a cup of coffee here after our massage next door. Walked past a number of times but never really try them out.

They have alfresco seating outside the cafe as well which will be good for night time. Very bright environment inside the cafe with all the white lights.

Had an americano and it was pretty good. Prices reasonable and parking facility is right at the door step.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
samlivestoeat,5,"Spacious and relaxing environment to chill over drinks and pastries!

While their drinks are not bad, what really impressed me are their buttery and flaky croissants! 🥐

Maisarah,5,"We had a bombastic teatime here as the cafe was very pretty and cool! We sit at second floor and the view was mesmerising.

I came here with my 3 friends and we share the bagel and croissant. The croissant was super delicious and I believe it is one of their signature. Everyone should try their croissant as it was super creamy inside and very crispy on the outside. The bagel is good too, the cream cheese matcha is the best. The yam latte was good too as it is made from real fruit and not powder and the taste are really like ice cream. My order is the Chengdu latte and I rate it 9/10! It is super delicious and everyone should try it once.

Overall the price is still on the average side. The ambience was great with an art galleries style of cafe. During our visit, it is not pack with customers and we can take picture without having to wait for others.

When it is our time to go home, we ask for carrier but they were very kind to give us paper bag also🥹 We appreciate their effort and good service. We will come back here again in future to get the taste of their croissant!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105510286299841712414/reviews
