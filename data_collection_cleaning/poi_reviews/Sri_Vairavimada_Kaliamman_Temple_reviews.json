The swamy propadu and alagaram or decorations were excellent. Disappointed on Nadeswaram performance. The musicians were average. The Nattu Mallari performance by temple muscians for God processions was poor. Our traditions on processions and Agama must be preserved to pass it to the next generations. Need improvements. The chief priest of the temple was not performing the poojas, and the juniors priest were performing. Hope temple management takes note of the required improvements.",

      "text": "Feedback Regarding Accessibility Challenges at the Temple\n\nTo Temple Management\n\nI am writing this feedback to bring to your attention a concern regarding the accessibility of the temple for elderly or physically challenged devotees.\n\nLast Thursday, I visited the temple with my friendâ€™s 83-year-old mother, who is wheelchair-bound, for her prayers in memory of her recently deceased son. While we greatly appreciate the opportunity to seek solace and spiritual comfort, we encountered significant difficulty accessing the main sanctum.\n\nThe ramp leading to the temple was extremely steep, to the point that it required six people to assist in pushing the wheelchair. This posed not only a logistical challenge but also a safety risk, as the steepness made it very difficult to control the wheelchair.\n\nI humbly suggest that the temple management considers reviewing the current infrastructure and possibly making the necessary adjustments to improve accessibility, especially for those who are elderly or physically challenged. A gentler slope or alternative solutions could ensure that all devotees can visit the temple safely and without undue hardship.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that with your continued efforts, the temple will remain a welcoming and inclusive space for all.",
