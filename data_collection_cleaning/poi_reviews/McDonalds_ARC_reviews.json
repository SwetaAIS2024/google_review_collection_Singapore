The staff is very friendly and hardworking.\n\nWeekend Breakfast:\nFree refills of coffee, tea or milk.\n\nDisadvantage:\nThe coffee is almost tasteless and cold. Very poor quality. Also in a modern coffee pot that doesn't work to open.\n\nRecommendation for breakfast: NO",

Despite likely being exhausted, he delivered top-notch service with a warm smile and genuine care. He made our quick stop so pleasant and memorable. McDonald‚Äôs is lucky to have such a dedicated team member.. around 8:20pm++ 4th of May",

Decent coffee at lesser price.\n6. Open 24/7.\n7. Free McDonald's,  Singtel WiFi and wireless@sgx.\n\nBad:\n\n1. View is not that great.\n2. May face delay at McCafe as the barista usually is working at McDonald's. ==> No McCafe / Barista anymore.\n3. Needs more toilets.\n4. AC is connected to ARC mall. When malls AC is switched off, temperatures may rise up here as well.\n\n====================\n\nEdit post renovation, Nov-2023\n\n1. McCafe is no more. Sad.\n2. Changed to a more airy, beige brown theme.\n2. More  tables with USB chargers now.\n3. No more vegetarian options except üçü.\n\n====================\n\nEdit : Feb 2025\n\nCoffee quality is not that great. It is often lukewarm. Skip this McDonald's if you want to have coffee or tea.",

Seats are comfortable and there is Mc cafe available in the same premises for coffee and desserts. Hidden gem and quite accessible by public transport. In terms of crowd, I am sure weekdays is a different story though considering the number of offices nearby",
