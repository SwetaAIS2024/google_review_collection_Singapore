Food portion is good. Chicken chop rice was delicious. For the pork chop, felt they put so much sauce that I could hardly taste the pork but it was still good nonetheless. Parking is relatively a challenge but gets better when it's later in the night.",

Don‚Äôt compare to atas western restaurants which charge GST.\nI have ordered pork chop(2 pieces) instead of the ‚Äòmust try‚Äô chicken chop and I must said I am damn impressed of the generous serving and thickness compare to other kopitiam (cheat feeling).\nI also notice there were some unhappy customers frustrated about the ordering system/kiosk malfunction. Just a suggestion to the store, maybe install more than 1 kiosk machine in case one breakdown.\nHave tried fish & chips and chicken chop on separate days‚Ä¶honestly a bit average. Just a personal preference, pork chop is my ‚Äògo-to‚Äôüòù",

I thought it‚Äôs a bit pricey but am surprised the portion is quite big with a sizable piece of chicken with a sunny side egg, delicious fry, baked beans, breads. The pepper sauce is savoury, chicken chop is very tender, perfectly cooked, very tasty. The generous portion is good for a satisfying meal. Overall taste is good. Totally worth a try. The coffee shop is not big, seats are limited, best to avoid peak hours.",
