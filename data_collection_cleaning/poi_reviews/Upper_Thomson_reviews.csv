Flo Yeow,5,"Clean, new, and convenient MRT train station. It's a great addition to the Upper Thomson neighborhood, especially the many eateries, shopping mall, residential estate, and church. You'll just need to be a little mindful of the exit that you're heading towards, lest you get lost.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Ryan Teo,1,"24 hour underpass is a lie. Please be aware, there is NO 24hr underpass, tried to walk through the previous night around 12am, and they closed all the exits, was stuck in the station till someone working there opened a shutter for me to exit.

@SMRT fix your signage information",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107134811980792818853/reviews
Jo S,5,"Clean station, connects you to many exits within the area, including to Thomson Plaza directly. There is a Cheers store, but noted recently that it is temporarily closed. Apart from that, no stores in the station, but does not matter since there are plenty of other shops nearby.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106877170813991386159/reviews
