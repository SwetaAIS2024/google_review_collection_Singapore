berat kaban,5,"I stayed for 3 days. There was no window in my room but it was not a problem for me. Room was small but for that price it was okay and clean. All the staff was great and helpful, especially Mr. Joshua. Thx for everything. See you on the next time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117287779597831193504/reviews
Rod,5,"A huge thank you for making our stay in SGP an enjoyable and comfortable one.

Everyone was always very welcoming and happy to help whenever we needed assistance.

Roshin was amazing in making sure our room was spotless and ensuring our stay was comfortable!!

Great budget accommodation in a fantastic location.  Maxwell Hawker Hall, Chinatown, heaps of eateries, parklands and 3 MRT Stations (Outram Park, Chinatown and Maxwell) all within 5-10 minutes walk.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114462485474849931788/reviews

Sinny able,4,"As we didn't want to stay in a hostel, we booked this budget hotel through Agoda. We booked two rooms, both with two single beds. One of the room was of decent size like what we booked but the other was so small that after putting in two baggage there was hardly any space to walk. The rooms were relatively clean. No complaint about the air condition and hot water. Location wise is near China town area and MRT.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100899718779777936488/reviews
tim ranford,1,"This Hotel is disgusting and filthy.
All hidden by the best angled, cropped, picturesque, touched up, pictures that they show you on the Internet.
Until you get there for yourself and see it with your own eyes, how disgusting and filthy the rooms are.
They always show your their best pictures to lure you in and your definitely not given that!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110721464560536620200/reviews
