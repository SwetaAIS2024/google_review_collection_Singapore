Verdant Heng,5,"I walked in alone cos I happened to be in the area and had not realised beforehand that Lazy Potato is nearby. Have been wanting to check here out for some time! No regrets man.

Easy to check in, I paid cash. $53 for 2 hours Premium room because Deluxe rooms were full. VERY comfortable sofa - so cushy and nice to sit on! Room decor was soothing and inviting. I came alone so the board game passes are N.A. to me, but I can imagine a group would be able to well use them! TV is huge for comfortable viewing, though I didn't switch the volume too loud as I read that the rooms aren't soundproof. Aircon is nice and cool. A great experience catching up on my anime of the moment, Demon Slayer here!

Do look out for the 3 cables where you can charge up your phone's juice! I only noticed when I was packing up to leave. Argh!

Lastly, the toilet is really clean and comfortable to use. I mind this because I have been to cafes with beautiful facades, yet their toilets leave much to be desired.

Gian Long Choo,5,"Lazy Potato Caf√© @ Paya Lebar is an absolute hidden gem! From the moment I stepped in, I felt like I had entered my own cozy little world. The private entertainment rooms are such a brilliant idea‚Äîsnuggled up with my best friend, we binged our favorite Netflix series and played Mario Kart on the Nintendo Switch for hours.

The atmosphere is warm, intimate, and incredibly relaxing. No noisy crowds, no interruptions‚Äîjust pure comfort. It felt like a sleepover, but with an even cozier setup!

What really stood out was the attention to detail. The lighting, the plush seating, the seamless streaming‚Äîit was all perfectly designed for unwinding. This place is perfect for a date night, a chill hangout, or even a solo escape from the world. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110979697548612379744/reviews
