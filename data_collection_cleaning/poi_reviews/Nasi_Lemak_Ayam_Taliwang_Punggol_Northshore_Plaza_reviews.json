At S$8, it's one of the pricier hawker fare but will definitely order again for the taste and quality.\nAlso, the staff were super nice and friendly.",

Saw her taking big packets of frozen Otah and throw it on the floor when packing. Definitely have stocks but she is just lazy to sell it.\n\nAfter bringing home the Otah, realise all the Otah are undercooked. See pictures.\n\nRecommend to avoid at all cost to avoid food poisoning.",

Rice is fluffy, bergedi is crispy and abit too oily but awesome.\n\nUpdate: changed 5 stars to 1 star, their food standard massively dropped. Chicken batter completely changed to not sure eating batter or chicken. No standard. Even the worst kfc is nicer",
