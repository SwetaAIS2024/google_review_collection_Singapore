Nur Afrina,1,"Terrible experience. Aunty serving us was so rude. She was screaming and shouting at another customer while taking my order and then told me it's my fault that she Keyes in order incorrectly. I respect hawkers but not one that speak like an uneducated swine.

Worse is they put back uneaten eggs into their egg pot that they take back from the return trays. Lol.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101737894371931568152/reviews
Edwin Tjoa,3,"Food selection is good. However, caipng is at $4.90 and coffee at $1.50. Caipng is so-so. This coffee shop is tucked away in a quiet corner and sheltered parking is closed by.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100618680188512887780/reviews
JT,1,"I’ve bought from this stall many times because it’s close to my area and the food is good. However, there are a couple of things that could be improved:

Service: When there are customers, it would be better if the aunty could focus more on them instead of watching her drama.
Pricing: The prices can vary for the same order (2 meats and 1 veg), ranging from $4+ to $6+. A consistent price would be helpful.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106666801923447888077/reviews
Marcus C.,1,"太平洋 economic mixed rice stall standard has been dropping quite drastically over the years. Initially the standard of the food was quite consistent and the pricing was fair. Recently, they put up the pricing for 2 veg + 1 meat rice meal for $3. But the pricing always turn out to be $3.50 or $3.60. When asked, the seller will say broccoli or long beans is considered a meat item. Or the meat like diced gongbao chicken is considered premium meat... They mentioned if want the $3 meal, must tell them beforehand... What was really upsetting was they only places 2 pieces of tofu and considered it a veg dish as shown in the picture (whole packet cost $3.60). This is not the right way to do business as there are alot of old folks staying around this area; many are staying in rental flats too.

Hope the stall owner look into this and provide a more transparent pricing and fair food distribution. Perhaps, you can include the pricing upfront on a signboard or at the display tray itself to prevent such occurrences. Thanks.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118052330054060492716/reviews
