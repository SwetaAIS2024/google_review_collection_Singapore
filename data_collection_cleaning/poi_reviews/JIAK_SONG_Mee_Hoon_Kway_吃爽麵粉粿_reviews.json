It's quite flavourful. Noodles are also tasty and texture is good. They use a small machine to run through the noodles or to cut it ? Not very sure. For dry version, they put the egg in the small soup bowl. Egg is watery and half cooked. The portion is not alot. Overall it's decent and can be better foe the price and branding.",

What really stood out, though, was the unmistakable \"wok hei\". The noodles themselves were perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of chewiness to complement the savory broth. A great, affordable option for those craving a satisfying noodle dish with that authentic smoky kick.",

Their dry noodles come in a very unique sauce that has a distinct smokey character to it - no where else have I tasted noodles like this before! The noodles themselves are chewy and has a nice bite, and the chilli has a spicy-sour kick that overall just gives this dish much more oomph. Their soup is also not your average run-of-the-mill soup either, it's almost like egg drop soup here. And best of all, all this for just $4.50...woo!",
