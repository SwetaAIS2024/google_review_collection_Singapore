I don’t know if I was mad hungry but every single bite was heavenly. It’s at a forlorn location of Jooks but will go back just to eat again.\nService: Ample staff to entertain guests\nCost/Value for money: indian food is generally more ex but not necessarily nice. This one is goooood. Great afternoon meal.",

Went here for dinner and ordered 3 cheese pratas and a soda. they tried to charge me $13 saying $3.50 a prata but that still wouldnt add up to that much. told them i wasnt gonna pay that, they brought it down to $10.70 couldnt be bothered to argue anymore so just accepted it. Thought it was cause of my skin colour(im white) but gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed inflation had took its toll. Upon research later, even springleaf prata doesnt charge that much??? Absolutely disgusting.",
