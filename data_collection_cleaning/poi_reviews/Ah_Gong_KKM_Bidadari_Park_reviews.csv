MH Tham,3,"Painfully mediocre, the intensely red soup does nothing to redeem it. Most adults in SG would be able to cook instant noodles just as good, if not better. The only upside is the generous portion of noodles. However, at $12, it better be!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112376174358198242550/reviews

Zachary Chan,1,"Overhyped - 20mins waiting time for a bowl of KKM is kinda ridiculous. This is off-peak on a workday, (nearing 9pm on a Monday).

Staff also forgot whether the order was dine-in or takeaway. Unapologetic as well. Have also tried several outlets, the owners doesn't seem to have quality control over the consistency of taste and service.

They seem to like to put the noodles on the table for a long time before serving.

Would recommend the orh kee noodles beside for a quicker, tastier fix.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105393546067623865700/reviews
Roxannengmingli,1,"Why would anyone choose to eat instant noodles confuses me.
Why anyone would think it is profitable to make a store selling instant noodles for exorbitant prices is just beyond me.
