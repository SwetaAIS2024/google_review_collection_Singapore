Fergus was very thorough in explaining the issue and helped me step by step restoring my pond and introducing new fish that I bought from him. Picture attached shows how big the fish has grown in 6 months. Fergus is still helping me whenever I have questions about water quality or feed. Truly above and beyond service that I seldom see in other shops.",
