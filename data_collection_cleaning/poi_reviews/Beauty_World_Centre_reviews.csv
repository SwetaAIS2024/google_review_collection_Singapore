Skye,3,"Some good food choices here but lack of cleanliness is a turn off.

Had a cereal chicken which at $15.90 is pretty expensive for a hawker plus the taste was only so-so. Blanco court fish soup was $5.90 and tasty.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102781898416952699742/reviews
Reiko H,3,"Variety of food to explore ranging from simple economical rice, thunder tea rice, Korean food and few others just as a typical hawker Center setting. Located at Level 4, I enjoyed the wide variety of popular food available here but having issues with the environment, it can be extremely warm & ventilation was not on par with the food offered here. Despite the limited fan installed at this food court, I am seeing patrons queuing in almost every stall. Some popular stalls generated snake long queue.

Dos Ocampo,4,"A mall that will take you back in 1980s Singapore. This mall have been revamped already but still has its 80s vibe. This mall offers a lot of options when it comes to shop variety: grocery, bakeshops, food, tuition centres, stationery, massage, beauty and wellness, even fortune telling! Despite its age, it is still very much alive and not short of mallgoers.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113878842024193042926/reviews
Brandon Lee,4,"It's very leisurely to wait for the bus under the warm sunshine. It would be nice to enjoy the fragrantness of a cup of coffee for a while. There are various snacks and drinks available, so you can choose something that suits your taste. I think you can refresh yourself and recharge your energy with a short break. I hope you have a good day.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110467530464710267789/reviews
rosp,4,"Beauty World is a bustling hub, with many kids attending tuition classes. The McDonald's is always busy, thanks to its dedicated manager and hardworking staff.
