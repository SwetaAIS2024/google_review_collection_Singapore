Charles Goh,5,"My wife and I had an absolutely fantastic dining experience at this restaurant!

From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel so welcome with their warm and attentive service. (Didnâ€™t manage to get service staff name, but she is so helpful and even reach out to help us snap a photo)

The food was so deliciousâ€”each dish was full of flavor and cooked to perfection. The atmosphere was just as impressive; it had the perfect balance of cozy and lively, making it the ideal spot for a relaxing meal.

LexTeo8888,3,"Was brought to this Izakaya in a quite out of the way area. Service was abit lackadaisical and food wise was alright but nothing to shout out about.

Their speciality seems to be the yakitori and I tried their Wagyu beef skewer priced at $16+ for 2 skewers of beef. Was below expectations as Wagyu beef skewers go...not the least not char on the greyish looking meat which failed my visual test taste wise was average.

Sashimi and temaki was slightly better but price wise lost out to Sushi Zanmai.

Overall was ok but won't be worth the trip to eat again as it's quite expensive for average food.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115467381167777606695/reviews
Lauren P.Y.,5,"Surprise find. Place is quite small but cosy. Food is surprisingly delicious. Like all the food we ordered - chicken skewer, tebasaki, kaisen don, salmon mentaki don, wagyu beef don, mushroom skewer etc.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103627435343462361847/reviews
Angie Lee,5,Came for dinner and I find the place rather cosy. Wasn't too many people on a weekday dinner. Ordered a few light dishes and all of them were great! My absolute favourite that night has got to be the monkfish liver. Very soft and tender; I'd never know it's a fish's liver I'm eating. No fishy taste or smell at all. The grilled items were delicious (I was looking for leek but they don't seem to have it ... I thought it's a very normal grill item in a Japanese restaurant). Can try the tsukune with onsen egg. The beef exceed my expectations too. Would definitely come back to try more.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113079303299361802517/reviews
