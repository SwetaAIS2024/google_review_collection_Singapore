      "text": "Sai Mandir is well maintained and is always my go to place.\n\nThe only thing I don‚Äôt like is - during the Arati time priest sings in mic - in his own way - mostly happens on Thursday.\nAs usual and always they can play it in the music system rather than the priest singing it. Because he follows his own way to sing - which is really changing the peacefulness\n\nAnd again after this review as well, the priest is singing .. üòí",

      "text": "This is the only sai baba worship centre in singapore. Just located at Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman amman temple, Little India. The worship centre is very disciplined and relaxing for a good chanting. Although die to covid-19 the allowed time for dharsan is 5mins for each pax. The centre is well maintained and the organizers appear little bit rude, but thats the only way to maintain the centre in an organized way. Keep on your timings as they wont allow even 1 min after the closing time.\n\nThere are 3 slots to visit if you are planning for arthi and dharshan\n8:45-11:30 am, 5:30-6:10 pm, 7-8:10pm",
