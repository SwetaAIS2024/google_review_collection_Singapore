      "text": "Good to see world class players set up their lube blending plant in Tuas.\n\nFeb 12, 2021 is 年初一\nDecided to add another half marathon into my book since Covid-19 has changed the world so drastically. CNY celebration is scaled down in order to control the spread.\nDecided to take my usual route : International Road, Benoi Road, Gul Circle, Tuas Crescent, Tuas South Ave 5, Tuas South Boulevard and finally touched the Tuas Lamp Post 1 for the 5th time. Less traffic cos it's a public holiday. I was the only one who runs for the 5th time.\nFrom Total Lubricants, there's another 3km to the destination.\nMy water bottle was empty, did not bring any Koda energy gel. But i must push on for the last stretch.\nMuscles a little stiff but no cramps. Mentally must be strong to carry on.\nThere were several groups of cyclists also advanced to the same spit. We waved to cheer up each other.\nAfter a few selfies, i walked 5km to the 1st bus stop. Tried to get water from the my usual stop at KJM coffee shop but it's closed. Walked over to Shell Petrol station opposite but it's closed too. Found the vending machine so inserted $2 note but stuck and lost my money without anything.\nDecided to walk further in search for any store but failed. No choice, hop on to bus 248 to Tuas West MRT to carry my exhausted body to Jurong Point to grab a bottle of orange juice at 7 eleven.\nWhat a day. Lesson learnt is: don't jog this far on CNY Holidays.",
