Vivien Soh,5,"Located opposite HDB Blk 401 amk Ave 10, tried their lala claypot $9.90 promotion. It is meant for 2 to 4 pax. The soup is surprisingly nice and the lala is fresh. Both charcoal claypot with charcoal grilled Bbq is really nice. I can choose to cook either steamboat or grilled charcoal bbq. They open throughout cny.

Kit Hoo Chan,3,Only the broth is worth mentioning. The meat and other ingredients not up to expectations. And i am not expecting restaurant standards. The charcoal flame is very powerful. Often drying out the soup fast.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111285973036265745549/reviews
