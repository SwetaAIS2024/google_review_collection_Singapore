MrA,4,"Only $1.10 for a decent milk tea. This stall is at level 3, in front of the escalators. I canâ€™t think of anywhere else cheaper than this.

Alvin Choo,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of my kopi siew dai at this stall. I'm not sure if it's because the auntie decided to make a fresh pot of coffee but the combination of coffee and milk was just nice and is much better than many other places by a long shot.

Will definitely be ordering kopi from this stall if I dine at taman jurong food centre in the future.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
