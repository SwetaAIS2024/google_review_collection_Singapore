prettymuch arreaga,3,Had an appointment for someones birthday there and for myself as well. Front desk staff were friendly and I took the fat detox massage and it was good and was well however only had one problem with the place which was the masseuse who did me wanted to sell me the 4 month package for the fat detox and was talking about how i was fat. I personally feel like it is really unprofessional of them but its alright. aside from that great place.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105723326752966217566/reviews

Amalia Mazlan,5,"Very professional and very thoughtful especially when i'm post night shift, they adjust the timing in accordance to my shift timing. Very caring staff and friendly! The staff are very professional. The owner (kak zubaidah) and kak lina was very sweet and helped me through my bridal spa. When I didn't understand anything or when I was afraid of any pain, kak lina was very reassuring. The treatment was very satisfying which exceeded my expectations and really calmed me down a lot. It was my first time doing cupping and I was nervous about it but with kak lina's reassurance, I remained calm and relaxed. My whole bridal spa was amazing. Kudos to citra ayu. Will definitely come again when there's an opportunity.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101657110190223998656/reviews
