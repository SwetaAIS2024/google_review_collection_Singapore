Tracy White,1,"It's very expensive for a beer, and I wouldn't recommend going to Bar@ Larong 13 as it's totally overpriced. S$14.85 for 1 Tiger beer. Totally not worth it. Go elsewhere and have a better experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111012536196802314209/reviews
Siewjean Wong,5,"Found this place about 4 years ago and this has become my favourite bar. The bar staff are always friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere is great if you just want to unwind by yourself or meet people. Drinks are reasonably priced and food is good although I do wish there was more variety in that area.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117291182795516598038/reviews
