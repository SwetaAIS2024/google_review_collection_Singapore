      "text": "I’ve heard plenty of great things about this teppanyaki spot, so I finally decided to try it for myself. The restaurant has a sleek, modern ambiance, and we were seated at the bar with a front-row view of the chef in action!\n\nService was smooth, the staff kindly informed us of a 30-minute wait before seating us, but our food arrived in less time than expected. While the dishes were decent, nothing particularly wowed me. That said, it’s a great option if you’re in the area, especially considering the reasonable pricing.\n\nBonus points for the excellent service and the chef’s charm (yes, quite the eye-candy lol). All in all, a pleasant dining experience worth checking out!",

Do make reservations before your visit as they have limited seats and it takes time for the chef to cook for your food for you.",
