I saw the staff member already took my ice cream tub out of the fridge, but didn’t give it to me. I waited for a long time, worried the ice cream would melt, so I asked if I could receive it. The staff said “your number hasn’t been called yet.” I asked if they could be flexible since I only bought one ready-to-go item, but they insisted I had to wait until they finished making drinks for other customers first. The staff member (in the photo) replied, “this is the policy” (?!) when I asked again.\n\nVery rigid and poor service. I give this place 1 star.",

      "text": "Ordered a coconut taro shake with coconut balls. The drink is a coconut blended drink with taro paste with balls. A couple of sips in we realized our drink didn’t have any coconut balls in it. We went back to the store to inform the workers and they said they’d add coconut balls to the drink (the one we drank from). We agreed to this and left with our drink and as we were sipping it we realized there was no more taro paste in the drink. We went back again to inform the worker who advised they did scoop the taro paste into our drink. I advised it doesn’t taste like taro and that we initially had paste at the bottom of our drink. They said they can add more taro paste to our drink. They took a new cup and added paste to the bottom and poured the remainder of our drink into that new cup. It felt weird that they didn’t just make a new drink for us because by the end of this whole situation, our coconut shake had melted and the entire integrity of the drink does not taste like how it would have if we were to have gotten our drink correct in the first place. I feel like their profit margins are big enough for them to remake our drink and for customer satisfaction. I would not order from Mr. Coconut again after this experience.",
