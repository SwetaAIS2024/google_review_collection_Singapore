      "text": "I recently stayed at PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay and had a pleasant experience. The hotel has a lively atmosphere and can get quite busy, but the service remains efficient.\n\nThe breakfast was delicious, with a good variety of options. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, offering a relaxing stay. The location is excellent—just a short walk to Marina Bay, shopping malls, and plenty of dining options.\n\nWhat I loved most was the hotel’s stunning greenery and nature-inspired design, creating a serene urban oasis. Overall, a great stay in a prime location! Would recommend.",

Room was good size and well maintained. I had the opportunity to book a full body massage shortly after check in. Rosa was amazing! Super relaxing and the perfect pressure. I highly recommend this property and Rosa for spa services.",

We loved pulling the curtains back in the morning and watching the thunderstorm over marina bay. The food was brilliant too with an  excellent selection at breakfast. All the staff were exceptionally friendly and we couldn't fault our stay at all. The environment credentials are what sold it to me initially and it delivered on this and so much more!",

I noticed a water filter was provided, but I chose not to use it due to the overall condition of the toilet.\n\nThe breakfast buffet was also disappointing, with limited variety and not many options available. I hope this can be improved.\n\nOn a positive note, the staff were helpful and friendly. Overall, the service was okay, but there is room for improvement, especially in terms of cleanliness and food selection.\n\nOne bonus point worth mentioning is that the hotel/restaurant has a halal certificate, which is a great advantage for Muslim customers. Well done!",
