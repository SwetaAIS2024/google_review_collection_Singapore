The courts are clearly marked, the nets are in great condition, and the layout provides plenty of room for comfortable play.\n\nWhat really sets this place apart is how well-lit it is at night. The bright floodlights mean you can enjoy evening games without any visibility issues‚Äîperfect for those who work during the day or prefer cooler evening sessions.\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to get to, just minutes from Orchard, with nearby parking and public transport options. Whether you're a beginner or seasoned player, this is one of the best outdoor pickleball spots in Singapore. Highly recommend!",

Their structured yet engaging training approach has greatly improved my child‚Äôs skills and confidence on the court. It is disheartening to hear that they will be relocating due to the tenure expiry, as this academy has been a cherished part of the community.
