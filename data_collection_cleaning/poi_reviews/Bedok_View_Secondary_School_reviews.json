Iâ€™m not very pleased with this school. will not bring my children to open house after their PSLE.",

Crimes do happened in rare cases. Hardly make any good company, was treated as if I just existed.  Bad influence do exist there.\nWouldn't recommend going to this neighborhood school unless you have no better choices.\n\nPlease don't make a bad decision after PSLE. You will have to suffer 4-6 years there\n\nEdit: Bedok View must fall",
