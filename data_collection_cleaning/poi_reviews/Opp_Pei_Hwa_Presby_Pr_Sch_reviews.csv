Flo Yeow,3,"It's along a new road, which is now made into a 2 way traffic. It's a lovely setup, but it's bare minimum with very scrappy shelters and sign boards leading you to the bus too. It's very easy to miss, so make sure you follow the signages to lead you to this bus stop!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
