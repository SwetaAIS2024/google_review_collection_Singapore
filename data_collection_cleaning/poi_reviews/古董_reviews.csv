joestoys,5,"It’s a hidden gold mine of antique treasures… many vintage items… there are a least 4-6 individual stores each have their specialty.

The place is like a giant time capsule… feel free to browse thru. Many owner are nice and allow to take pictures and some are not. you will definitely find something unique.

This place will not be here any more as the government is take back the land for redevelopment. So hurry down before it’s gone.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114651806834704567887/reviews
