It has recently changed management and now has less than half of the beers and wines available. Prices seem to have increased significantly also. They now do their own bar food and luckily you can still bring in food from outside. Despite these changes, the atmosphere was still decent on the Saturday evening I attended.",

Prices have also increased but still patronise this with my friends because the atmosphere is relaxed and is one of the few limited options around the neighbourhood.",
