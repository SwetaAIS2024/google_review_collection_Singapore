zolewashere,5,"This is really a wonderful and amazing school. I'm currently a Secondary 3 student (2021). Happy 15th Anniversary Greendale! This school really changed who I am. The friends I've made along the way, the teachers that encouraged and helped me and the others that helped me. Many Alumni and past Council Presidents came back this year and it was great. When my time comes and I have to leave this great school, I'll definitely come back to greet the inspiring teachers. Hopefully by then I'll be a Life-long Learner, A Critical Thinker and A Confident leader. But most importantly, I hope that I would have reached my dream, to be a known animator/artist. Continue to help students grow, Greendale Secondary School. We'll meet again.

HampterLikesKebabz,5,"Hello I am a Secondary 1 student in the year 2024. I have good things to say about this school. The teachers over there are so understanding and kind. They will help you no matter what. They will also bond with my classmates and have fun. During lesson times, they will teach but the difference is I enjoy their presence as their fun personality made the lessons so fun! At the start of the year, I was really timid and was afraid of getting bullied. Greendale wasn’t my 1st choice but my 3rd choice. At first, I was dissatisfied as I didn’t go to my dream school but I fail to realise that the teachers and students here are very kind to help out. My favourite part of this school is the camps. Unlike other schools, every year, we would have a camp such as CAMP RISE and CAMP SHINE. I like this as I get to know my peers and teachers. What I also like about this school is their flexibility. They would hear about your opinions such as, wearing the formal uniform may be hot and comfortable. The Student Council will help us students and come up with ideas. They changed the formal uniform to the Polo-tee which is more comfortable and I am grateful for this system this school sets. If I would recommend a school to P6 students I would probably recommend Greendale Secondary due to their outstanding performance!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113645902962709038355/reviews
