Joyce “Joyful Explorer”,5,"Learning Gallery at Level 1 is a spacious and cozy venue designed to inspire curiosity and wonder, inspired by the theme of childhood. The Cloud Library has a thoughtfully curated collection of books. Do spend some time reading them. One of the standout exhibits for me is Everyday Practices on Level 3, which offers a poignant exploration of the lives of individuals who have faced significant hardships. It’s an immersive and thoughtful experience that makes the visit worthwhile. Plan to spend at least 2 hours at SAM to fully appreciate everything on offer. Definitely worth a visit!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116040496274789301932/reviews
Nigel K,4,"Came for the Singapore Art Week event to check it out. It was quite loud, almost like a rave with most merchants having to scream to get their communication across. Also went into the exhibition inside the building and it was quite normal. I love the scenery behind the building with the giant machinery and tons of containers",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107936615422991378038/reviews
