      "text": "My passport photo taken looked really good, and the final copies were done quickly! I got the online version almost immediately, and the printed one 20 minutes later. Mark was the one servicing me, and he was friendly, and made me feel comfortable while taking the photo. He took a few shots and we sat down to choose the best one together. I have tried ID booths (photo was so blurry!), and even went to a photo / print service that you see in most malls (the company name of which I won't mention) and none of them captured my face nicely for the passport photo. This place was the best, and cost less than the photo/ print service company. Totally recommend!!",
