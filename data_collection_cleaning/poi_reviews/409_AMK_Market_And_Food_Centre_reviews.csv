Ivan Teh,4,"Lamb Chop (SGD $14) @ Yummy Western.
.
This long-standing stall has unusually had its internet presence wiped clean recently, and despite online rumors that they closed, this stall is very much still opening regularly.
.
Their lamb ribs is thick and chunky, having tender chewy texture with full flavoured smoky meaty salty savoury peppery spice flavour.
.
The heavily dressed coleslaw is crunchy with vegetal sweet flavour, while the crisp potato chips hold starchy salty flavour.
.
The crisp buttered toasted white bread has straightforward buttery bready toasty sweet savoury notes, and the soft warm baked beans in tomato sauce carry vegetal earthy sour sweet flavour.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114332345573544911646/reviews

W8ll8am Gastby S8m,3,"Local hawker centres generally have wet markets to support.

Tried the mee siam , more of the Chinese taste and strong coconut gravy . Above average, it can be more spicy.

The soya bean was the worst I ever tried. ü§¢

I still prefer Tao Payong Lorong 8 Hawker Centre.
The best still Airport Road Hawker Centre in my own view.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101069809328749995510/reviews
