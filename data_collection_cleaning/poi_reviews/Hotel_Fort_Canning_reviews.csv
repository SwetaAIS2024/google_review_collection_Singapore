Andrew Fung,5,Held my wedding here with one night stay. One waitress at the banquet really impressed us by helping with my wife's very long dress during the march in and champagne pouring. I understand the hotel will be rejuvenated soon.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103486170659569500003/reviews

Dr Jennine Huet,3,"The bathroom is not in a separate room. The sink is across from the bed. The toilet and shower are next to the bed with a sliding door where you can have privacy in either one or the other, but not both at once.  Very strange lay out. The location was excellent.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109243524580923363153/reviews
Glenn Tay,5,"Don't missed out staying at this fantastic property.

Stayed over for New Year's Eve.able to see the fireworks from here. Room was spacious, Bath Tub was spacious and my kids had a lot of fun!

The service, food from this hotel was priceless, everything was amazing and I had a memorable spent new year with my family while avoiding and squeezing with the crowds in the esplanade or Marina Area.!

Thank you Sunset Hospitality, for this amazing experience!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106168014354754994496/reviews
Wendy Tay,3,"Hotel has aged overtime. You can tell from the facade, the carpark and the ballrooms.

It was once a really sought after place for staycation due to its prime location. Worth to consider revamping the space :)",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104938513841882372834/reviews
