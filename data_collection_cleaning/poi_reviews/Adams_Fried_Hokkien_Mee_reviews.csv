Kesmond Kwek,3,"My first time trying this store. The fried Kuay Teow taste ok but lack of Wok Hey, kind of watery, soft was not oilly, the color was a little pale and not appealing. Their version of Fried Kuay Teow comes with fresh cockles and prawn from S$4 to $6 is reasonably priced. They also serve Hokkien mee, oyster omelette and fried carrots cake.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106594644998430315896/reviews
