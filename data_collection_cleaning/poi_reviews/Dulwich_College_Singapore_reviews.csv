Venu Desai,5,"We had a truly wonderful experience with the admissions process. Lucy and the team demonstrated genuine empathy and provided invaluable guidance, leading to a successful outcome. The school's campus, facilities, and academic excellence are among the best on the island. We're confident our child will thrive here!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112913824470554687490/reviews
Darren Yates,5,Very excited to have the kids join Dulwich. The school campus looks amazing and the families we know with kids there all rave about the teachers and facilities. Admissions team was super helpful and responsive throughout the process.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105637071439983812209/reviews
T. C,1,"Could the school cease from heavy traffic and work opposite my home till 9ish pm?(Blk 445B). I had enough of workers and staff peering into my home. I am sure there is cut off school operation hours especially if it near residential area. I simply don't understand the school's need to function specifically areas facing homes. Surely, for a large school meetings, could be directed to other parts of school. Moreover, your school closes around 3ish, easily you could direct your cleaners to commence cleaning or maintenance thereafter, instead of starting work from 6ish onwards from my observations. It has been 7 years and I do not see any attempt to improve or be considerate towards being good neighbours.  Apart from heavy usage of residential facilities by your school parents and student  throughout the day, I have reached my height of tolerance and quite frankly I am done being accommodative.  All other local schools in the neighbourhood are not this destructive. Please work on improving your understanding to local cultures.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105040293738776363544/reviews
S F,1,"It felt like a zoo on the bus with some of the oversized students behaving poorly. They were eating chips and sharing it around, making a lot of noise, and sitting in an unsightly manner. It seemed like they had no sense of proper social behaviour. Not the first time i’ve encountered through these years, the school simply doesn’t bother to take action.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104470256631229083623/reviews
G S,2,"This review is not about the school in general, but just about Sodexo. Some staff of Sodexo are nice, but most are just cruel. If you lose your lanyard, they make you go without lunch! Also, you may think it is good that they have pizza, but i ripped off the cheese and the top bit of the bread, and there was mould on the pizza! with that, the price fore two tiny slices of pizza that you have to wait for ten minutes to get costs $7!
Even the normal food quality is meh.
The school is pretty good though.
The bus aunties are really mean by the way.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100742535195189188494/reviews
