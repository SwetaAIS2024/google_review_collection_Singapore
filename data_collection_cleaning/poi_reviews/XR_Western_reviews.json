Waiting time for me was within 10 minutes, food was served in fresh hot state, portion was quite generous. Besides bottled chili sauce, bottled mayonnaise was also provided.\nWhite cream pasta is quite creamy with good garlic taste.\nThe kopitiam is quite clean and neat.",

Once they insisted on frying me an extra piece of battered fish because they felt the 2 pieces of fish given to me did not meet their expected size.\n\nIf you live nearby or come to Kebun Bahru for meals please give them a try!",
