I see they like to talk about obeying government and repenting but then someone point out their wrongdoing they don't address it but try so hard to cover up their own illegal activity. Hypocrite much?!? Also not safe with all the heavy vehicles and machinery.",

      "text": "What can i say? I love this church! No, not the place, but the people and their King.\n\nI am sorry to see that someone who left the church with an axe to grind has posed as Martin Luther, no less, to criticise her. If this 'Luther' was really a covenant child himself (which I doubt), his/her comments speaks of his/her father's neglect; if he is, in fact, the father, he is, as it were, shooting himself in the foot, for the main responsibility of catechetical instruction really belongs to the father, not the church (Eph 6:4; Dt 6:7). The church should, at best, play a supplementary role. The catechetical method of instruction to impart a form of sound doctrine (2 Tim 1:13), nevertheless, has a long and godly tradition.\n\nIn any case, every attempt to do the right things will attract criticisms by those who disagree. There are always things we can do better on this side of eternity! Thankfully amongst fellow believers, very few imagine that they are doing the public a favour by their seemingly humble opinions and objective assessments when they air their grievances under the cloak of anonymity and pretext of knowledge. What has the 95 Theses got to do with anything said in the 'critique'?\n\nMay the Lord forgive us our pretensions, failures and hubris. Thank God our King does not cast us away despite our unworthiness.\n\nCome and see for yourself! We are far from perfect as a church. There is much more we can improve on, including our corporate and personal efforts to reach the unconverted; but our King is perfect and He has condescended not only to bear with us, but to own us as His brothers and sisters, and co-labourers! Come hear the voice of our King as the gospel is preached and His songs are sung every Lord's Day.",
