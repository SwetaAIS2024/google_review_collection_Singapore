Anyway, it's my feelings. It may be true or may not be true.\nThe cut-off point for non-affiliated students is 7 to 10 for G3. The cut-off point for affiliated students is 7 to 20 for G3. The difference is too drastic. I was really disappointed when I noticed this.\nI did not recommend my son to join this school. He also agreed with me.",
