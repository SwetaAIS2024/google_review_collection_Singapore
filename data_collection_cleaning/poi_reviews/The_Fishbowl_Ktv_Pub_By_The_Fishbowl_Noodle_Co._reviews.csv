Jeremy Yap,5,"This shop has been around for at least a year.
The outside is dark, so I did not visit it until this month.

Luckily I gave it a try, and i have been visiting it at least 2or3times weekly.
Thank you for bringing us constantly good food! yummy!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103564329127113339872/reviews
jia hui chew,2,"firstly, the lady at the counter was pretty rude. i requested for all fishballs instead of having meatballs or fish cakes & she replied me with a frustrated tone ‚Äú ÊàëÊ≤°ÊúâÂäûÊ≥ïÂèª‚Äù. (i can‚Äôt do it)

secondly, take away costs you additional $0.50. bring your own takeaway lunch boxes if you want. a bowl of noodles cost $5.00 ok.

thirdly, do not ever order black sauce as it is EXTREMELY SALTY. try if you dare. fishballs no taste. noodles texture okok.

overall, won‚Äôt be back for this overpriced bowl of noodles.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105442131570132423330/reviews
David Bay Yong Sheng,5,"Very different from those at the hawker centre, MEE POK AND MEE KIA are what I will really call 'Q', not dry and cluster together but very soft and smooth texture that kind. Not bad, one of the better ones I ate in singapore. Price is also very affordable.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109265916038908089904/reviews
