Irina De Sepibus,1,"Extremely disappointing food and service. They were catering an event at our school and were totally unprepared for the number of people attending. We queued for 40 min with 6 people in front of us to order 4 beef and chicken ‚Äústeak burgers‚Äù. The food is inedible, $35 straight in the bin. Boiled beef meat of questionable origin in a soggy bun, chicken slightly better, all tasted absolutely disgusting. And this was meant to cater a children and parents event. Staff were super unfriendly, service couldn‚Äôt be slower if they tried and every single order was packed in a separate plastic bag we didn‚Äôt ask for. So disappointed with hungry kids that we still need to feed somewhere.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100061099795098423701/reviews
Royal Pears,2,"The quality of the coffee has plummeted. They seem to have stopped serving specialty coffee, at least not in the form of a flat white, which was more a long black with a thick layer of foam. Even during the circuit breaker, they‚Äôd served good coffee with chocolaty/nutty flavoured beans from Liberty. Then, the steak and cheese grilled sandwich tasted nice though there was room for the portion of ingredients to be more substantial.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108275532362304111934/reviews
Hong Heee Tan (Jim),4,"I recommend to try the meatballs burger and the long black.
Fries is crispy and tasty, salad dressing a bit like wafu dressing, very refreshing.
Portion look small but you will feel very full after you finish it.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105157820954605224495/reviews
JL,2,"not recommend the Mushroom Aglio Olio, dried and hard, ordered two plates and one plate without the Red bell Pepper but üëçüèº coffee.
check out monthly special dish to avoid disappointment.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104296708513954932762/reviews
