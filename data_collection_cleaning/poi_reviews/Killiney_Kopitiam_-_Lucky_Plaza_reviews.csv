D L,4,Food is decent. Bee hoon is nice but a bit salty. Eggs are decent. The staff here looks a bit fierce. The kitchen looks dark.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104966613744701231932/reviews
Potato Head,4,"Local vibes and good for tourist to try casual local food here.
Central location, decent food.

Henry Tan,1,"Eggs were raw, so I send them back for replacement. They must have microwaved it and returned the same eggs to me. I didn’t eat it, of course. Service was pathetic. This experience turned me off the Killiney Kopitiam chain.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102834035350881000143/reviews
Ariff Suffian,4,"A true classic! This is my first time trying out in Singapore, I’ve tried them a few times in Malaysia (unfortunately they’re no more to be found). I had the usual Kaya Toast set. The coffee and eggs were good as usual. However there was a slight disappointment with the amount of kaya and butter in the toast! Other than that, it was a good breakfast.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117024100760027653935/reviews
Charlie Chan,4,"Had breakfast here. The kaya toast was nice and not too sweet. The fried bee hoon was very delicious and had lots of ingredients. But the nasi lemak was a bit disappointing. We dined in but it came in a package and we had to unwrap it, which was not hot. Better save the money for other food on the menu. The milk tea was great though.

The entrance of this restaurant is outside the mall and faces Orchard Road. It took us quite some time to find it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108563146880827343344/reviews
