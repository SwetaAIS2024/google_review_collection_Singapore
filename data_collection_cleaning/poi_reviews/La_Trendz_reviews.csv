Frickfracktic Baby,1,This is about the anchor point branch. Absolutely horrible business. Woman was rude and didn't even let me try out a dress. Horrid and will never recommend it to anyone in the entire world. Especially the workers were unhelpful and completely detached. If there was a negative rating I would give it to them with no qualms.,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106463334175407103644/reviews
