Booked the appointment time but reached there earlier and was called just right on the dot of the timing which was great because it meant no time wasted. There's a cute nurse at the counter as well. Was expecting poor service because it's free but the young male doctor was professional and great consultation was still provided during the vaccination procedures. Highly recommended.",
