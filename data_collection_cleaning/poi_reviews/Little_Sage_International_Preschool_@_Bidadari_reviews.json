      "text": "The teachers are caring and genuinely love the children here. We know that because my child is very communicative, and often incorporates their names in his pretend play scenarios. It is a small school, and the number of children is naturally kept small, and this has helped the children bond better with the teachers. They would also communicate promptly with parents in case of any issue, either through the app, or the principal may also reach out on phone / WhatsApp in an urgent situation.\n\nWe are also satisfied with the curriculum, although do note that generally it seems to be a little faster than some preschools, and parents should not be overly stressed. For example, the children learn Tang poems, and start to recognise and trace Chinese characters, as early as N1. It is also fun for the children to learn about different countries and cultures in school, and I am sure many parents are learning together with their children too.",
