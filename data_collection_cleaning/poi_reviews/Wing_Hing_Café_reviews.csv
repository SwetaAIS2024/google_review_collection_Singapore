WT Wong,4,"Had the fish ball Meepok and coffee (Meepok is from adjacent stall Jia Ji Fishball Noodle) .
Meepok cooking well controlled and not soggy at all. Chilli and sour sauces were well concocted.
Good fix for Meepok at such food court cafe.
Price a bit steep as the meal cost more than $10.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116204037022034321113/reviews
Bernard Chung,4,"Chanced upon this place after my F45 class, and was pleasantly surprised by the food and ambience. Had classic dim sum dishes like Siew mai and Har Gow, and I was pretty pleased with what I was served considering I paid below $5 for each.

The siew mai was fresh, crunchy and juicy. And the fried bean curd skin rolls were not oily.

Everything is steamed or fried only upon order. My milk tea was decent; even if you’ll never gonna find a joint here that can replicate how they serve it in HK. This was a decent stab; there was that tannic punch in the tea HK milk teas need.

There was some effort in putting in a HK vibe, with the wallpaper and canto pop music, but the counter staff weren’t gruff or bored-looking  enough like they are in HK.

Overall, for what you pay, it’s pretty decent. Plus, you probably won’t have to queue or wait long on most days (I often wonder how businesses in Leisure Park Kallang survive; it’s always so quiet here).",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115075096997904763191/reviews
Alvin Leong,5,I tried the char siew. Usually I don't have high expectations for mall restaurants but this one was pretty good. Better than most hawker char siew.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106332588051823314820/reviews
Eric Ang,2,"We had shrimp fried rice, macaroni and big Bao.
The prices were pretty reasonable vs the portion which is great for 2 sharing.  However, the food were all pretty salty.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115245833718597963688/reviews
