      "text": "Hands down, some of the best food I’ve had recently! The freshness of the ingredients and the unique flavors in the Fritto Misto were unforgettable. Highly recommended for food enthusiasts!”\n\nAnd it was already listed into my little princess *Most Delicious Food listing* , and now is was the champion. However, she used to change her mind frequently and quickly, but anyhow now it was the champion which is what i strongly agreed with her.\n\nThe service is really great and the restaurant is very clean and hygienic. And they do provide kids tableware which are suitable for children's small hands which i think it made extra points as not much restaurant actually provide currently.\n\nOverall experience is excellent! I will definitely come again and again.",

The team are always warm and friendly especially Mr Daniel always checking in taking good care of us. We keep going back.",

      "text": "Went for dinner not too long ago. The food was pretty decent. Particularly liked the lamb. It was tender, flavourful, and had a good char. Paired well with the chianti. Calamari batter could have been crispier. Pizza was alright. Toppings were good. Dough was soft, but overall structure leaned a little towards a pita. Truffle cheese wheel carbonara was cheesy and rich. Truffle Sage butter ravioli sauce was aromatic and nicely emulsified, but the pasta filling fell slightly short. Limoncello sponge with pistachio ice cream dessert was a great way to end the meal. The service was friendly and hospitable, but the place was full towards the rush hour, so some patience is needed. Limoncello house digestives were very much appreciated. Prices are on the higher end, but the quality-price ratio is still ok if you factor in location and overall experience.",
