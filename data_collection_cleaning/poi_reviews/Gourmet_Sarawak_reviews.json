The kolomee was a little overcooked, but the laksa gravy was flavorful, with a nice balance of spices.\n\nIt’s hard to get a seat in the morning, so you have to walk around and wait",

But texture was good.\n\nEdit: 2nd try of laksa and this time too much oil. I think the broth is not mixed properly. Kolo mee worth trying",
