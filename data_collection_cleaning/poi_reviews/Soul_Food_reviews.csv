Elaine Low,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this remarkable social enterprise. The delectable food, inviting ambiance, and impeccable service made it a memorable experience. What sets this place apart is its commitment to empowering differently-abled individuals, creating a dining experience that not only satisfies the palate but also warms the heart. A must-visit for those who appreciate exceptional cuisine with a purpose.

Thank you Anne!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108534239072725248380/reviews

Gina “Chef”,5,Had a fantastic lunch at Soul Food. Setting is cozy and homely. Definitely worth coming back. Salmon is not dry. I don’t feel thirsty after my meal. I love how they turned an ordinary vegetables (cabbage) into a star dish! Amazing! Want to try their dinner but understand dinners and weekends reserved for private events!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115074810182518695930/reviews
K K,5,"This place is rather low key. A simple set up behind dark tinted glass frontage. But it's a lovely place for a nice quiet lunch. The food quality is very good. I particularly liked the ribs. Today there were only sets available, salmon and ribs.  Both very nice. The staff are kind and friendly too. As an added bonus, this is an inclusive establishment.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101557443580464751545/reviews
CK C,5,"The food here is soul good, comparable to those offered by five-star hotels in terms of taste and food quality. It is amazing that the chef, Gerald, is self taught. And the three course meal is so value for money at just $35 nett. The menu changes every week. If only they open in the evenings and weekends. Both owners Anne and Gerald were extremely friendly and made us felt at home. The other staff were great too.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
