Wan Ting Ngoi,5,I was a student for a few years and I feel that the teachers over there are really strict with their students in a good way. They will also share joy with them when they received good results. If there is a student who received bad results they will find ways to make these students improve. I am one of their students who have grades from U to A1 and I am really glad to have lessons over there.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103025267981755790876/reviews
