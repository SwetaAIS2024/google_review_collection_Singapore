      "text": "My girlâ€™s been at Kinderland Loyang since she was in infant care. Sheâ€™s turning 5 soon. Not the cheapest vis-a-vis the other options out there but we do get well and beyond what we are paying for.\n\nExcellent facilities, educators, quality of feedback etc. My girl looks forward to school each day. And we do see her progress really well in her speech, confidence and other aspects of her development evey single week.\n\nWe did, for a period of one or two weeks, try to send her to another operator but the drop in standard was really alot to accept. Fortunately, Kinderland was really nice to take her back in and we have absolutely no regrets since. 5/5 (would have given an extra star or two if i could)",

      "text": "Highly recommend Kinderland to parents looking for infant care services for their little one @ Pasir Ris.\nThe teachers are all so patient and attentive to all the kids which can be seen during drop-off and pick ups!\n\nLocated at the mall, the school is air conditioned and secured. The team takes great pride in ensuring the kids are well taken care of and learning in a clean and safe environment.\n\nWorking parents can also conveniently grab a light breakfast or coffee to go after dropping off their kids which can be done in less than 15 mins (grace period for free parking ðŸ˜‰).\n\nMy experience so far have been worry-free and a breeze and I hope all parents get to share this with me.",

      "text": "As a first-time parent, choosing the right infant care was daunting, but Kinderland at Loyang Point was a choice I never regretted. I entrusted my first child to their care since infancy and have been consistently impressed, and I plan to send my second child there as well.\n\nThe teachers are incredibly personable and attentive, making both the parents and children feel comfortable and valued. They go above and beyond in their care and vigilance. For instance, they were the first to notice my child's cow milk protein allergy when it could have been easily dismissed as colic. This attention to detail gave us significant comfort, showing how closely they monitor each child's health and well-being.\n\nI highly recommend Kinderland at Loyang Point to any parents looking for a safe, nurturing, and professional environment for their little ones!",
