Nurwidya Abdul,5,"Such a gem in the East! Nice and cozy shack to dine and catch up with old friends ❤️ Tried the Chicken Mala and it's one of the best Mala I've had in a while! Portion is good for the price and I'm still dreaming about it days after 🤭 Their Chicken Wings are dope too! Wished I could try everything on the menu, but too bad, Mala stole my heart, my tummy and tastebuds 😅 Owners are friendly and fun to chat with! Such a wonderful experience, definitely coming back 👍🏼👍🏼",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101566467485259903014/reviews
Philip Rowell,4,"Nice neighborhood bar run by a friendly couple who took over the place recently.
Note that Island Nation beers are no longer served here, just the standard Tiger, Guinness etc.
Pleasant spot for a couple of cold pints.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102970791965068551176/reviews
N,5,They have some excellent Island Nation craft beers on tap (cocktails also meant to be good). A proper little cosy neighborhood bar within Barkshore Park condo (open to the public). Serves food also. Friendly staff you can have a chat to. Happy hour prices are a good deal.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113981206030743504689/reviews
