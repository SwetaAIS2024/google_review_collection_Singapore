The atmosphere here is nice and you can watch peacocks walking around elegantly.\nHear the stories of the animals sharing the place and it's interesting.",

It was juicy and cooked to perfection, I dare say it's comparable if not better than shake shack that's nearby. Price wise it's reasonable. Service and staff was great! Looking forward to coming back for it again!",

The Prata is a must-try; it’s traditionally made, puffy, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. The curry is well-cooked and flavorful. Additionally, the beef burger is highly recommended—the beef patty is juicy and perfectly seasoned. The set comes with waffle fries that remind us of our childhood snacks.",
