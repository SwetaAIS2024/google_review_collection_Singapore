Regina Tan,5,"Attentive and professional doctor who really take time to explain whats going on with the investigation.

Everything was prompt and fussfree.
Counter admins were really nice, instructions were clear and medication served immediately after consultation.

Affordable consultation price.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117508824010977914330/reviews
Whitney Chng,5,"have been visiting STAT for over a year now. Dr Ng is always very kind and has shown empathy for me every single visit. No matter how minor my sickness was. As I had allergy for a pro-longed period of time, the doctors also asked if there were any constructions or any environmental issues around my house that may be causing the allergy etc. Because of their extensive care, I always feel comfortable to go back to the clinic.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113756448091903465858/reviews
Alvin Koh,5,"This place is a rare gem of a clinic. Dr Ng is a friendly and professional doctor, who will take the time to diagnose your condition during your consultation. This is in contrast to most GPs spending only one minute seeing and sending you on your way. The ladies at the counter were patient and professional too. You can be ensured that you will receive due medical attention here.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113511676939154526465/reviews
Jacelyn Heng,5,"Dr Ng is the most wonderful doctor and his medicine always works on point. Multiple times i visited other doctors in other clinic due to emergency sickness and I always never ever recover on their medicine. Those doctors also doesn't seem to care about their patient and pass judgements about your illness very quickly. As such, i would always go back to Doctor Ng after and as always, his medicines makes me feel better within 2-3 days. He is very genuine and patient and caring, takes his time to do a comprehensive checkup before diagnosing you. He is one of the rarest doctor you can find nowadays.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109272343346952866623/reviews
Daniel Tan,3,"Disappointed with the service level of this clinic.  There was poor protocol and communication by the clinic when dealing with avoidable incidents. The front office staff needs to make a collective effort to improve their processes and also treat patients better.

I did my health screening under SFL program on 18 Jan and am told to come back a week later for review of results. When i went back today (on 29 Jan) after more than a week, I was told to wait as the clinic claimed that they had not received my lipid and blood sugar test results from the lab and so the doctor is unable to see me for my review. I was expecting a 15 mins wait at most but ended up waiting over an  hour for my lab report while other patients who came after me saw the doctor first.

Shouldnt the clinic have a monitoring system to ensure the lab reports are received by the clinic before the week is up? Otherwise it would be better to advise patient to give the clinic a call before going down to avoid waiting and  if the clinic do not have the resource to do such monitoring. When I provided such suggestions and feedback to the attending doctor (a locum) and the front office staff, i was given cold shoulders.  The impression i get is that they dont really bother or take the feedback seriously. The locum even suggested i come back to see Dr Ng and tell him th issues myself.

Also i do not know why my Lipid and Blood sugar test were ordered in one lab (Parkway) while my FIT test was conducted in a different lab (Innoquest). A friend of mine who went for health screening on the same day had all his tests sent to a single same lab (Innoquest). All his hardcopy results cane back from the lab. Wonder why the difference.  Furthermore, the attending doctor (locum) doing my review didnt even ask to check my blood pressure monitoring log. The moniter was ordered by Dr Ng on 18 Jan. I wonder if he realised that or just assumed they were alright based on experience.

This is not the first regrettable experience i have with this clinic. They mixed up my blood pressure record wIth another patient when i went for consultation in Nov 2022 having falling quite sick from COVID 19. There are other areas i felt they could do better. For example,  there is a lack of patient's confidentiality in the consultation room as either the door to the front office or door to rear room are left opened. Again i do not know why the doctors and nursing staff allowed that to happen. A patient in the rear room attended by a nurse in the rear room could hear the conversation between the doctor and his patient in the consultation room.

For my recent health screening experience on 18 Jan, one of the front staff lady was rather impolite. I did not know what triggered her rather rude manner when she asked impolitely if i wanted to see the doctor. Because of that, i think my blood pressure reading went up and stayed up. I get the feeling the non arrival of my report has to do with the staff's ""action or inaction"".  Or may be they were not looking under the Parkway pile of reports.The electronic report from the lab  was available in Health hub as early as 19 Jan and it was just so conicidental that i have to deal with the staff today over the delay of my report and also to find out that my tests are sent to two different labs.

Well, i am considering deregistering from this clinic for my Healthier SG program. I hope it can be done. Dont like to get high blood pressure from dealing with their front staff.

The clinic shouldnt bite more than it can chew  if high load is the reason for behaving impolitely to patients or for inefficiency arising from non receipt of lab report.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113737010540374775532/reviews
