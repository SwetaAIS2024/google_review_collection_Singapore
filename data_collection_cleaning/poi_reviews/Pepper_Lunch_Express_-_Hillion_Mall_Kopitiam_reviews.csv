Aviana,1,"Food is up to standard but the staffs are just super rude. I order 2 set of pepper chicken with cheese , 1 of the chicken pepper is double portion with cheese and both come with a set. The counter staff told me that only left with corn and miso soup , so I say okay one set with corn and another set with miso soup. After waiting for 15 minutes it come with one bowl of corn that is replacement for the miso soup. And did told the malay aunty that there's one more missing bowl of corn and she just came out with a refund of $0.10 and said I don't care.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106081455236001454293/reviews
Nor Hafizah Abd Hamid,3,"The place was at the food court area, got many seats available.

Order the beef pepper rice seat meal with miso soup and japanese pumpkin.

The food is up to the standards. No complaints.

Yet for the service crew, it‚Äôs a different story. Yes F&B industry can be quite challenging, but it‚Äôs not an excuse for the staff to be rude to customers.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114596237860058559728/reviews
