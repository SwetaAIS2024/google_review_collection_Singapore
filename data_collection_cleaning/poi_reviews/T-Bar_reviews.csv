Henry “Ht456”,5,"The new menu and shopfront are a welcome change. The prices remain reasonable. The tea is fragrant, and the toppings selection is extensive. I highly recommend getting your bubble tea or fruit tea fix here!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109493906755667343393/reviews
Jeff Tan,5,The milk tea is really nice with affordable price with just only $3 can enjoy it. The brown sugar pearl taste so well with the well bitting texture. Service of the outlet staffs also not bad.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106126649553776416759/reviews
Ken Peh,5,"I think this is a new stall as I didn't notice it being around during my previous visits. I decided to give it a try. Despite being a stall within the hawker center, don't be fooled by it, the taste is on par with those popular chain stores within shopping malls. Even though I ordered based on 25% sugar level, the bubble tea still taste super gao. Highly recommended if you are in this hawker center. It's located at level 2 of the hawker center, right side of the escalator so you don't miss it. By the way price is very economical too.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
misaki chan,1,"Okay, I'm a frequent buyer from this stall but sometimes, I get some inconsistency in the drinks (either too sweet or sometimes more fruits, sometimes less) which gets a little bit irritating because as buyers, we re-prchase a product holding the expectation that the quality holds. So it was a little disappointing sometimes when I could not enjoy the drink with the taste that I once had before. Just today, I had to throw my milk tea away because the sugar level was obviously adjusted wrongly (it is way too sweet than usual I wonder if the staff pressed it wrongly  because as someone with a sweet tooth, I still find the drink too sweet to be drinkable). Other than this, I love the type of drinks available at T-bar and the price is reasonably good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101254231010753572136/reviews
Amy Yee,5,"My favourite go to is the ""Class Pearl Milk Tea with 0% sugar"". Small size for $2.50! $1 more for large . Value for money!

Noted their number 1 drink is fruit tea.
It has big slices of watermelon with mixture of diced mango, passion fruit, pineapple etc. $3.50 for small. 0% sugar is already sweet.

Peach tea white pearl also nice. 0% sugar already sweet from the pearls.

My husband tried the durian milkshake, super strong flavour, overwhelming for him. I did not enjoy the honey green tea or pure green tea, it's more like sweet Jasmin tea.

Service is good! Free straws of different sizes and plastic bags provided.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116058321475732523491/reviews
