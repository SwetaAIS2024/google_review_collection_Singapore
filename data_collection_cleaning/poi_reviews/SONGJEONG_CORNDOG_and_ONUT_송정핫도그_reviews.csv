PheiChuen hayley,5,"The coffee, especially hot latte wasn't impressive and could have been better. However, the ramen corndog was amazing! Totally packs a punch when eaten with hot sauce. The staff members were friendly, and they allowed pets inside. Since we arrived early, it wasn't hot, so we decided to sit outside. The best is, they open as early as 8am, which is rare around Iskandar!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100701842521892355416/reviews
