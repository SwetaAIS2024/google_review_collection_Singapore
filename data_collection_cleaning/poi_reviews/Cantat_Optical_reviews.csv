AH,5,"Excellent specs shop. The staff were so calm and the only thing on their mind was to help me search for a specs that i liked. They helped me search for 1hr and were so calm and chilled. I like this very much. And the prices are all so affordable, much better than all other places i visited. I bought 1 pair, and i may buy another piece because they had alot of interesting frame options. A great decision to come here, im really pleased n satisfied. The staff Stella was so easy to talk to and the Uncle was so happy and calm. Great specs shop. Highly recommend for you to go there and experience yourself",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116386191367432215784/reviews
