T,1,Rude female staff asked me to close the fridge door for her when it was left open by another customer. Do I work there? And then rude to me when I did not know that a key was needed to open the ice cream freezer. What kind of person locks the freezer for customers and then expects them to know how to open it? Very immature and unreasonable cheapskate mentality. Will never go back to such an evil place.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102495333562518655304/reviews
