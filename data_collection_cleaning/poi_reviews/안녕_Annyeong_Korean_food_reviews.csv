E G,2,"very disappointing experience. The food here is overpriced and service is very slow (waited at least 30mins) for our food and shop is not even busy.
Kimbap tasted normal for the price paid. Fish cake soup is a little blend, it taste like those fish ball soup from hawker centre. Paid 8.50 for Spicy tteokbokki and portion is pathetic with little sauce.

for reference, we ordered chicken cheese sausage kimbap (beef bulgogi kimbap (both $12.50 each) spicy tteokbokki ($8.50), fish cake soup ($4.50) multigrain drink ($6.50).

Overall, i would not revisit or recommend this place to others",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102022990084172946541/reviews
Ong Zhi Yuan,5,"This little gem that sells one of the best kimbaps in Singapore is quietly located in at Cluny court, a stone throw from botanical gardens mrt.

The stall itself is relatively small, located by the roadside, and has pretty limited seating. Would advise to takeaway instead.

Having tried all of their kimbaps, I would recommend the cheese sausage and tuna kimbaps.. However, I would go to the extent of saying that all of them are delicious. Their kimbap is well wrapped, the ingredients fresh and complement each other very well.

Their sides and beverage are not to be dismissed either. Their fishcake soup is umami and addictive, and their korean multi grain drink provided a unique experience.

Would highly recommend a visit for the kimbap, EVEN if it's out of your way. 11/10.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104417804420531473764/reviews
CK C,3,"This is a tiny stall selling Korean food, with three tables outside for dine-in. A beeper was provided to collect orders. Kimbap tasted not bad. A little pricey though.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Clara Butt,4,"A small eatery.  There are no seats inside the shop.  Three 3 of us sat outside facing Dunearn road. Only a few tables and chairs outside along the walkway.  Perhaps it's more for takeaway.  Nevertheless, the rolls are really delicious.  Live the no-rice  option.  They use egg instead. The filling is a lot, the ingredients in the rolls are well cooked, and it's soft and tender.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  They spent time recommending their popular dishes and turned out as expected.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110337826064782590100/reviews
Jackie,3,"Ordered the chicken gimbap for $14.50 ($11.50 + $3 for keto version) and not going to lie, am disappointed. Maybe it’s due to the high 4.9 stars review that I had high expectations.

The egg was dry, chicken was hard, taste was average and serving was small for the price.

It’s also more of a takeout kiosk with very uncomfortable seats outside.

Overall, it’s very average.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107442461841912139307/reviews
