The views are very good in the room.\n\nI’m not a very fussy traveler so I’m quite pleased with everything.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the temperature of the room can be set to my liking.\n\nTap water is also drinkable as well. So that’s convenient.",

The Novena MRT Station is just below the hotel; there are two malls, a food court, and a 7-Eleven (which is open 24 hours) right next to the hotel for quick needs; the hotel has good amenities, loved the club pool and hot tubs.\n\nCons: The room needed fixes and it overall seemed worn down. There were no blackout curtains.",

The facilities were clean, comfortable, and well-maintained, and the ambiance made the experience even more relaxing.\n\nA special mention goes to Faith, who went above and beyond to ensure I felt welcomed and well-cared for. Their attention to detail, friendliness, and professionalism truly stood out and made my stay memorable. The beautiful birthday decoration, delicious birthday cake, complimentary snacks, fruits and mini bar goodies were such thoughtful touches that made the occasion feel extra special.\n\nI’ll definitely return and recommend this hotel to others. Thank you to the team!",
