Flo Yeow,1,"To be very honest, I don't understand how I'm able to clock the kind of bill I ended up with. 2 drinks and 1 dessert, for $10.30. It's quite insane how a cup of sugar cane is almost the same as a bowl of noodles. The kind of skills that go behind a bowl of noodles, vs the kind of effort taken to getting a cup of okay sugar cane, is just unjustifiable in my personal opinion.

Large cup of sugar cane ended up being $3.50 and I was like. Wow what a rip off!

The owners also feel quite stuck up in their little island, away from the main stretch of hawker stalls. Helps if they smiled a little more instead of portraying the ""you got no one else to buy from"" attitude.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Jonathan Chew,2,"The sugarcane is decent to be fair, but that said, it is a rather homogenous product that can't differ much from stall to stall. Apart from that, everything here is overpriced (even for the location) and the service is extremely poor with the uncle often snapping impatiently at the customers. It seems that the attitude that they portray is that the customers need them more than they need the customers.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106144108752002112533/reviews
