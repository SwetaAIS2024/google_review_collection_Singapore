Justin Xiao,4,This is a great place for younger kids and toddlers it probably Max out at kids who are eight years old because the slides are small and the pool is very shallow. I went over on a Friday mid morning and it was pretty crowded because there were a lot of classes and schools Using the facility for field trips. There is one lifeguard on duty and he was pretty diligent. The pool is shadow So there’s not much to worry about it’s more that it gets crowded and the kids are running around which may cause injuries. The bathrooms have showered facility however the shower pressure is super weak don’t expect you have a nice shower there. I wish they could improve the shower a little more and the lighting in the bathrooms perhaps you could put some shelter there for when the sun is really hot and the kids need some shelter. Overall not a bad place to go because they’re restaurants right beneath plus lots ofAircon,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114147367394477307367/reviews
