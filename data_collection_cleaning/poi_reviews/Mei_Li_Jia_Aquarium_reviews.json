      "text": "100% recommend people who wanna buy fishes. Not a lot of variety but uncle is very very nice, helped me to catch the fishes and did quality check on all my 4 fishes one by one before placing them in the container even though he asked me to catch them myself before that. He even gave me a good number of ketapang leaves for free coz my glos nipped the fins off my betta, explained to me how to use the leaves and help me check my bettaâ€™s condition after I showed him a photo of my poor betta. Quality control of the fishes not bad. Unlike one of the lfs I visited, the fishes here are very healthy and prices are very affordable too!",
