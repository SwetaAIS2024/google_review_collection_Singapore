CK Cheong,4,"It was a nice walk from Queenstown MRT to Robertson Quay via the Alexandra Park Connector. The stretch of Alexandra Park Connector is not long, and the portion starting from the condominium The Crest is very scenic next to the Singapore River. The Park Connector was not crowded and we had good weather resulting in a pleasant and easy walk which took slightly more than an hour",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114524725497942089541/reviews
Soo Hin Yeoh,5,"Wonderful jogging üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and cycling üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è path along the canal and river; a picturesque path to get from Redhill to CBD along the Singapore River.

At the end of the Redhill Tanglin Road end, there is a tranquil park built on top of the canal and is a great place for personal space exercises or reading a book.

If you need food & beverage, there are many options throughout the several exits.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115725392210756907778/reviews
Urban Explorer,5,Fantastic short park connector starting from Queenstown stretching to Robertson Quay. If you're up for a bike ride one can reach Marina Bay from Queenstown in about 20~30min.

Ivanna W,5,"I love walking along the park. It does get hot when the sun is up, but there are lots of trees too. When you're lucky, you can see monitor lizard and otters swimming at the canal",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117422612191677321157/reviews
