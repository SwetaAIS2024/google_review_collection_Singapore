      "text": "Tong Garden Seafood. Newly setup zi char stall. Decided to give a try. Ordered the claypot fishhead and creamy butter pork belly. The pork belly was very good. Very flavourful and tender. You can taste the salted egg flavour in the cream $13. As for the claypot fishhead, the taste wasn't very salty which was good. Generous amount of ingredients. But the fish wasn't as fresh $28. However I will give a try on other dishes to have a better overall assesment of their quality.",

      "text": "I'm sharing this post on behalf of my mum who had a bad experience at the drink stall of this coffeeshop. She had ordered a breakfast set at $4 which comes with a cup of coffee. Due to health reason and the need to take her regular medication, she requested to swop the coffee for a cup of hot water instead and was rudely declined. I've read that some reasons for not selling hot water was due to customer occupying the seat for hours with just a cup of hot water. In this case, she obviously bought food to consume at the coffeeshop so there's really no reason for rejecting her request. She then argued with the stallholder and asked to buy a cup of coffee \"without\" coffee, i.e. hot water only at the retail price of $1.30. Even then she was rejected. I mean, what is the rationale and reason. A customer could pay $1.30 for a cup of coffee and sit for hours. This coffeeshop was obviously being difficult and almost bullying her as an elderly.",
