Rayant Yeo,4,"Decided to try after watching a foodie review on YouTube.

Verdict: üëçüèºüëèüèº

$33 for 2 Large Pizzas. Ordered the Smokey Beef Pepperoni & Trufflicious Hawaiian. Loved the thin crust and ingredients tasted flavourful & delicious. I will definitely order it again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111160799570934501810/reviews
Lydia Heng,4,"Ordered 2 large pizzas from grab - truffle Hawaiian and the teriyaki chicken.
Tasty flavours, something different from the usual pizza tastes

Both were yummy. Chicken one was a little too sweet. Slightly less sweet would be better.

Price is on the high side if you get their premium flavours. For the same flavours, if I got on their website would be ~$46 excluding delivery fee.

Will eat it once in a while since it's nice but pricey

Note:
- their cheese packets are very little. Like only good for 1 slice of pizza.
- pizza prices on grab are more ex than the actual shop (both the base price and the premium add on prices). Delivery fee is about the same as the shop's own.
Based on their own website, delivery fee is 4.90",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110477061035605935081/reviews
AyeC Ong,5,"I had truffle hawaiian and truffle mushroom pizza. One of the best truffle pizza i ever had.... the fragrance of the truffle and its savory sauce and ingredients,  combine into perfect harmony in your mouth.  Also a shout out to the salted eggs fries...so yuumy. Will definitely order again!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102621026991859424083/reviews
Rusydi Didi,2,"For pepperoni pizza, you will get 1.5 pepperoni per slice.

For spicy prawn pizza, take a look at the size of the prawn.

The sauce is nice. Packaging is nice.
Just think it's too expensive. Don't think the price is worth it.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112633730972632433308/reviews
Yvette Sim,3,"Our first time trying their pizzas as we were craving for a good pizza to end off a busy day at work so we ordered their large mentaiko ocean and large truffle hawaiian with their 1-1 deal online. Even with the deal, it was not cheap or half the price we were expecting, mainly felt like we paid for 2 large pizzas without any 1-1 actually. The pizza came on time which we were excited about but the pizzas were both quite sad looking. With the price paid, we felt that we could have gotten our pizza fix elsewhere with better quality ingredients. The pizzas were good but i just can‚Äôt justify the price for the quality given.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113554219095754272403/reviews
