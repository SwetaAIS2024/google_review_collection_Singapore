      "text": "I have been visiting Harry for over 10 years for tailoring clothes, alterations and repairs. I used to live in Singapore, now when I need clothes/suits I visit Harry and use the opportunity to have a quick holiday in Singapore. Always a pleasure, my detail always on hand, smiling faces, old friends, basically just a very positive experience. I‚Äôm so happy the business survived covid and I look forward to another 10 years of tailored clothes. It was a great trip and until next time, thank you and take care!!\nTD",

There are many options for nice additions and I chose a custom liner for my jacket, a tie and handkerchief made from the same material, and my name sewn on the inside. These additions were very nice! After seeing the quality, I went back and purchased two custom shirts to go with my suit and they both turned out well. I would highly recommend Harry and Rekha to anyone in the area for all your custom suit/shirt needs.",

Having had the chance to try everything on, all I have to say is THANK YOU!  Everything is exactly as advertised‚Äîthey all look, feel and (most importantly) fit perfectly!  And how very kind of you to have included a selection of ties. They‚Äôre lovely.\n\nI‚Äôm so glad that we decided to make that quick visit to your shop as we wandered around the neighbourhood and I‚Äôm even more pleased that you convinced me to reconsider my need for a well tailored suit!",

I know people that have purchased suits and clothing when traveling to Asia and they have always recommended  I do the same if I'm ever there.  Harry was right there to answer my questions and show me all of the different options.  15 minutes later I was measured for a new suit and new button downs.\n\nended up purchasing two wool/cashmere (very nice!) suits  with an incredible silk liner and four button downs.  They all fit me perfectly, are extremely well made, and the materials are unique and high quality.  The cost of the custom suits & custom shirts was very fair, well worth the money I spent.\n\nHarry is a great guy running a great business. His suits and shirts are easily the highest quality available.  I  will be ordering additional suits and shirts in the future.  Thank you Harry!",
