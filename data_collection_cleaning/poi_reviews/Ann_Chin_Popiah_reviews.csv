MH Tham,1,"The popiah was extremely dry and lacked flavour, even though I had specifically requested extra chilli and garlic. Strangely, it tasted almost identical to the plain version we ordered without chilli or garlic, with the only difference being that the chilli one looked slightly redder.

Will not recommend.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112376174358198242550/reviews
Peter Yeo,4,Love Ann Chin Ann popiah. Itâ€™s my go-to for home popiah parties. The same great taste (I prefer my popiah on the sweeter side) is at this stall. Nice crispy toppings make all the difference.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110903267602730882054/reviews

Jacob TAN,4,"This is one of the better popiah chains with many outlets around Singapore. However at this branch, the quantity of the turnip is not as much. Taste is quite consistent with the other outlets.
Service here is good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews

a very very localized snacks, cheap and tasty, always a queue there coz the ingredients is freshly cooked and wrapped, it must be eaten up quickly otherwise the crispy chips could have been softened, you have the choice of spicy and non spicy roll..",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104294550580612755072/reviews
