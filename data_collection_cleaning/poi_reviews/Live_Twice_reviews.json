We were there few days ago and the drinks were pleasant enough, though nothing exceptional for the price. The service, however, was where things really stood out‚Ä¶ unfortunately not in a good way.\n\nApparently, dress codes here are silently enforced by how nicely (or not) you‚Äôre treated. Coming straight from work in less-than-party attire, we were clearly not part of the ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù crowd. One staff member graced us with her presence long enough to spill water on my wrist and, in a bold customer service move, didn‚Äôt bother with an apology or even basic acknowledgment. I guess I should‚Äôve taken the hint and brought sequins.\n\nIn short, great place if you enjoy cocktails with a splash of cold shoulder. If you‚Äôre dressed to impress, you might get a smile too!",
