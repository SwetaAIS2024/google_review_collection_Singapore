Yvonne was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process, and the quality of the prints exceeded my expectations. Not only did they meet my tight deadline, but they also handled everything with care. I wholeheartedly recommend them for anyone looking for professional and reliable printing services. I will definitely be back for future projects :) Special thanks to Yvonne and Corby for all your support!",

      "text": "Papypress has been such a blessing to us! Perhaps you will think that the wedding invitation suite wouldn't make a difference - for us, it really brought the wedding theme together and made it a wedding we could call our own.\n\nJonelle has been very professional, friendly and responsive right from the beginning. What I appreciate most is how passionate and enthusiastic she is about designing our invitations - it just made this process so much more personal and fun. She was very willing to explore different types of papers, colours, styles, and she was at the same time very forthcoming with proposing ideas and giving us professional advice on what is best.\n\nFurthermore, Jonelle and her team have been very generous with us. As we adapted to COVID19 exigencies, there were multiple changes, edits, and we even added in a couple of new designs at the last minute (that's on us, we forgot!) The team was very kind to discuss with us and edit right down to the most minute details, such as manually adjusting the curvature of the letter 'C' from the original base font. They genuinely understand that these are important to us and sincerely supported us in the decisions we made along the way.\n\nYou can take a look at the invitation suite - the gold print, blues, greens, and the intricate floral details (we had a customised logo too fitted in too!), and beautiful typography are a testament to their expertise and design finesse.\n\nWould love love love to work with you all once again! Thank you for being such an important part of our wedding :)\n\n---\n\nIn 2020, I worked with Papypress for the first time to design my family's small business logo. It is my dad's small business venture amidst COVID19 times, we had a tight budget and no expertise in design. I wrote to many companies but Papypress got back to us immediately and reached out to us to have a chat. I was most impressed by the email that they sent and how willing they were to find a way to support us - mind you, we were a small business, and PapyPress definitely has a name in the industry that I thought they wouldn't need a small client like us.\n\nSpeaking to Jonelle and Mei Wen, they were sincere and very genuine in working out an arrangement for us. It was such a joy working with these two designing what turned out to be such an intricate and colourful design! I love the design ideas that the team came up with, and I know how much effort must have gone into these iterations.\n\nThe design for our logo is just amazing - its versatile, subtly colourful, a hand-drawn thumbprint that is very symbolic and is exactly the size of my dad's thumbprint! It has been about a year and this logo is just perfect for all our needs, be it printed on a sticker or hot-stamped onto our wood products. Thank you, you two truly made a difference! :)",

The invitation holder was not debossed for easy folding on both sides, only on one side (and the reversed direction). Envelopes came without sealing tape or glue.",
