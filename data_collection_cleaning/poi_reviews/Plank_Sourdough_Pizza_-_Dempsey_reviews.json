      "text": "Good Pizzas.\nWe arrived on a rainy day and fortunately we booked before coming.\nThe pizza dough is delicious and I will try to follow their recipe from their book. It's a pity the kitchen is in a separate building otherwise the smell of the cooked bread or pizza would give people more appetite.\n\nThe service was lacking. We received the pizzas but no cutlery. I asked for the cutlery and the waiter gave a fork and a spoon... Hmmm ok, the spoon is part of the cutlery but do you use spoon to eat pizza in this restaurant? Finally after a couple of minutes I asked for a knife.\n\nAnother waiter asked us and the table near us if we had more orders. I think the waiters should just check in their system if there are more orders instead of disturbing the clients during their dinner. If they want to communicate with the customers, they can just ask what we think about their foods or if everything is alright, or if we need anything else.\n\nConclusion:\nGood foods but lack of waiters with experience",

      "text": "Visited this place after being highly recommended by 2 friends.\n\nI was disappointed. Service is non existent and perhaps its more of a self-service kind of place. The dough of the pizza was not seasoned at all and lacked salt. One of the diner with me visited the place before and said the pizza looked and tasted different from the time she last visited. So perhaps we got a 'bad batch' of dough. The crackers served with the Burrata was hard as rocks but perhaps its supposed to be like that.\nHmm. That's alot of Perhaps.\n\nNice ambience outside, very romantic with fairy lights.\n\nWill not revisit, there are many better places in Dempsey to eat and enjoy the ambience.",

      "text": "We went there for dinner. Like anywhere in Dempsey, it is a bit of walk from the main bus stops but the atmosphere was good. It has a small playground outside the cafe. Good for family with young kids.\n\nWe orderded a few pizzas - pepperoni, Parma ham, seafood, pumpkin salad, garden salad, fries, and garlic bread. They were all so good. The pumpkin salad is surprisingly delicious. The pumpkins were sweet and were not mushy. The sourdough pizzas were thin crust and tasted wonderful. Definitely a place to return to (maybe at another more conveniently located outlet).",
