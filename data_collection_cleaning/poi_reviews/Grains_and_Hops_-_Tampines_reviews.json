She was screaming and shouting at another customer while taking my order and then told me it's my fault that she Keyes in order incorrectly. I respect hawkers but not one that speak like an uneducated swine.\n\nWorse is they put back uneaten eggs into their egg pot that they take back from the return trays. Lol.",

However, there are a couple of things that could be improved:\n\nService: When there are customers, it would be better if the aunty could focus more on them instead of watching her drama.\nPricing: The prices can vary for the same order (2 meats and 1 veg), ranging from $4+ to $6+. A consistent price would be helpful.",

      "text": "太平洋 economic mixed rice stall standard has been dropping quite drastically over the years. Initially the standard of the food was quite consistent and the pricing was fair. Recently, they put up the pricing for 2 veg + 1 meat rice meal for $3. But the pricing always turn out to be $3.50 or $3.60. When asked, the seller will say broccoli or long beans is considered a meat item. Or the meat like diced gongbao chicken is considered premium meat... They mentioned if want the $3 meal, must tell them beforehand... What was really upsetting was they only places 2 pieces of tofu and considered it a veg dish as shown in the picture (whole packet cost $3.60). This is not the right way to do business as there are alot of old folks staying around this area; many are staying in rental flats too.\n\nHope the stall owner look into this and provide a more transparent pricing and fair food distribution. Perhaps, you can include the pricing upfront on a signboard or at the display tray itself to prevent such occurrences. Thanks.",
