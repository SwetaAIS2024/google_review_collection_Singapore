The joyous Mood was so catchy and we also started dancing at the stage when the dance songs came in. Absolutely an experience oneuat catch in a lifetime - whether you are an Indian or not. But you have to go for the right movie to experience it. So consult your Indian friends.\nCheck it out.",

      "text": "Singaporean film-lovers’ venue for arty and indie films, and some mainstream features. The retro seats at the Green Room and Red Room are on VERY steep tiers, and leg room is quite limited, but the ambience is like few other places in the country and if you love that, you’d wanna come here again and again.\n\nStaff is very friendly and approachable, whether at the box office or at Intermission Bar. Oh, despite the older-world feeling, the equipment here is the same as any modern cinema in Singapore. The audio system and picture quality are on par with any of the swanky multiplexes elsewhere.",
