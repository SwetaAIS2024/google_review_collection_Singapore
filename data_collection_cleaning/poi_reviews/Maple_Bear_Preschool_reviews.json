      "text": "The worse customer service ever!\nI wanted to enroll my baby in preschool. I called the school many times but no one answered. I finally got through and left my information. They said someone would contact me, but there was no news after more than a month. I went there in person later. The school asked me to fill out an information form outside the door and said they would contact me, but there was no news. I went to the official website to fill in the information, and finally someone sent me an email, but they just told me that the school visit slot was closed. It’s full, so you can only wait. list, I replied to the email and said that I had left a message a long time ago, but no one responded to me, and then there was no news from me. I was very disappointed. The service of a large chain preschool would be so poor. I can’t imagine leaving children to them. Will you really be serious and responsible? big question mark!",
