Aya Ibrahim,5,Fresh fish from the sea to your hands. Friendly and honest people. The best crab that I ever had.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116661514425093962667/reviews
Green Jelly,5,"Enjoyed shopping at this fishermanâ€™s market. Very limited variety, depending on the catch of the day. Most stall holders speak only Malay and little English. Some of the fish were really fresh, still in rigor motis state. However, price was not very cheap. Can get cheaper or comparable price in some markets in Singapore. However, it was still enjoyable to wander around the rustic countryside. The drive to Pendas market was relaxing due to a very different landscape from Singapore. Was quite an experience driving through the wide expanse of highway roads and not seeing any high rise buildings, as well as navigating the narrow meandering countryside roads with oil palm trees lined on both sides. Will definitely visit again.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111696044521483348397/reviews
Afiq,2,"Not worth it. Very limited options, some time u go there got fish, sometimes nothing at all. Not worth the long drive, price almost same like if go to the nearby pasar.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117829451322290821652/reviews
BY Ang,3,"Used to be a good place to get fresh seafood at price cheaper than market but during my recent visit, I found that the price for the sea prawns was same as what Pontian Fish Market was selling. As for the flower crabs, the price did not increase but the crabs were smaller in size.

I hope it was seasonal issue that affected the price; need to confirm during future visit.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111357861805860735364/reviews
