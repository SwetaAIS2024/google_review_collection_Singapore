      "text": "Decided to head down to this quiet but at the same time lively old folks town to try out the recent trendy matcha shop that is located within the market called Corner Shop.\n\nThere are a lot of food choices to choose from, and I decided to eat the mee pok from 132 traditional teochew mee pok ($4, $5, $6) there. The noodles are quite springy and chewy with a nice kick of spice from the chili. 4/5 as the noodle felt a bit too floury, kinda feels a little undercooked, but nonetheless, it still tasted good.\n\nFor drinks, I got the Ice Matcha Latte ($5.50 + $0.1 for takeaway). The matcha was traditional hand whisk with the cha sen and matcha bowl. The taste, astringency, and mouthfeels wise are okay to me as there are much better matcha places out there, but for the price point of $5.50, I felt it was good enough as it is in the hawker centre so no complains on that. They do sell traditional nan yang coffee too from Yong Seng, a traditional nan yang coffee distributor in singapore. Will try it next time if I have the chance to.\n\nVerdict : I would go back again if I'm near the area but won't specifically make my way down if im from somewhere far away.",

      "text": "So, the former owner of Chee Cheong Fun closed their stall, but luckily, a new owner has stepped in to fill the void. The new CCF is very different compared to its predecessor. Firstly, the waiting time has significantly reduced from the previous establishment (having been an institution in the community for many years and beloved by everyone) since they’re new and replacing the old reliable stall. Secondly, the current owner's CCF aligns perfectly with my preferences. It boasts a smoother, lighter, and fluffier texture compared to the previous one (which was much denser and grainier since they milled their own rice flour on the spot). I highly recommend giving them a try if you're around the neighborhood.",

Papaya and grapes very high quality. I don’t mind paying the price for good stuff- family enjoy them so much. Good job Spencer.. they are located near the hawker centre towards the centre of the market..it is a small market. Sorry cannot give a better description",
