Orange,3,"Second time eating this. First time was long time ago. Which was damn bad. However this time was a newbie who cooked without his senior. He looks like heâ€™s only 1-2 days new. But boy, it was good. Fish were perfectly cooked. And I think he gave more than normal portion haha. Ordered number 8, mee sua fish soup",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
Li Chun Ho,1,"Food is average at best. The service is terrible as the staff responsible for cooking is blatantly rude. There are better sellers serving fish soup around the same area, suggest to patronise these other sellers instead.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106261322153634489292/reviews
Ngai Suet Loo,1,"Ordered dried Ban Mee and Fish Soup with rice through delivery platform, really not worth it as the fish slices are so thin that hard to be seen in the soup, same to the bitter gourd slices that I need to dig the pan mee and found 3 small thin slices.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109107553580490925235/reviews
