M .L,5,"Ordered the Baguette Set with Beef, Lemon Grass Chicken Roll and Lemongrass. Total is S$11.90

Overall all, value for money, and good tasting too. Really enjoyed the chew Lemongrass chicken roll and the thick beef slices.

Baguette was large and came with carrots, lettuce, some sweet sauce and the beef slices. I especially liked the crunchy bread, which went well with the sweet sauce and fillings. The beef was nicely seasoned too.

The Lemongrass chicken roll had a chewy exterior with a delicious interior.

The Lemongrass drink was slightly sweet, but not too sweet.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107338373340911636912/reviews

Skye Cai,4,"The ordering process is very fast, order from the small counter.
The preparation process is very fast too, for those Teh/ Kopi, they pre-prepared in advance.
For teh, it can be very sweet. Teh taste is lesser.
Price is reasonable and good around the area.
But the queue can be very difficult to identify.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
