Roger Thomas Tan,5,Nice cosy place to get groceries. Nice ambience especially at the entrance area. Lots of variety to choose from. Many plant based meat to look out for too! Some are hidden near the canned ham/luncheon meat area or canned tuna area. Some are at the frozen meat fridges. Lots of ice cream selection. Lots of drinks selection. Lots of roast meat selection! Many marinated meat cuts for ready cooking at home! Unity is part of this NTUC. Even has a toilet for patrons to use if you really need to go. Staffs are very friendly and they have many self paying kiosk for use to skip the queue! Best of all it is open 24 hours!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106328611890771249243/reviews
Mark Ong,4,A quiet 24hours supermarket located in an isolated corner of kovan. It may not be a exhaustive supermarket with most item. However many household item and grocery could be found here.  I find their fresh meat selection a little lacking . Fresh pork selection are quite miserable at times. Management here are quite lacking as I experience all manned counter closing at once when they change shift. Overall most staff here are quite friendly and helpful.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117348003086836979353/reviews
