Run Sui Em,5,"I am currently studying at this college, which I came to know about through my cousin who has already graduated from here. One of the things I appreciate most is that this college teaches the Right Doctrine. I truly enjoy the teaching, the environment, and everything about it. The teachers and all the office staff are very friendly and supportive, making us feel like one big family. Besides the lessons, the atmosphere here is warm and welcoming, and thereâ€™s a strong sense of community that helps us grow not only academically but also spiritually and personally.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107886655198492530877/reviews
