Diana Lim,5,"Very nice surroundings. Chanced upon this while walking in the vicinity and there are volunteer guides at the gallery. Very friendly and informative. Opened for 2 years but little known venue hidden among the bushes.

State visit gifts from other countries are on display..Seasonal, these collections will be changed.

Nice to check it out if you are around de area.

There are photo opportunity spots with Istana restricted area rooms as backdrop.

At the end of your walk, you can also take home a state imprint (self pressed) bookmark. Love it!
Spend about 20 minutes here.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117742363663051144853/reviews
Êûó‰ºüÂ∞ÜDavid Valentino,5,"The gallery itself isn't big.
But they are store and display many main point in history of Singapore and the national palace of Singapore itself.

The staffs is friendly, i even got many presentation and guide from them. They even tell me about how the palace will open for public in every public holiday/national holiday, although i already know and just hear it to test their kindess and knowledge(please forgive me üòÅ).

They are kind and offer me to take photo in one spot that make a replica for one of the palace most famous spot (the one public can't enter because it just for other countries official guests), but im too embarrassed to take a photo there.

Oh i got a bookmark that stamped by national sign of Singapore's presidency emblem. And i was the one who stamp it from the stamp machine directly.

What an amazing experience !

Thanks for the staff in there, really make my nerd soul happy and went insane inside üòÇü•≥üéâ.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104114531145115111506/reviews
