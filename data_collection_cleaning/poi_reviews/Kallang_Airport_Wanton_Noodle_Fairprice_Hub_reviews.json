      "text": "Had an unpleasant experience at this wonton mee stall. The vietnamese staff were quite rude and occupied tables for an extended period during the busy lunch hour, making it difficult for other customers to find seats. I seated the table of 8 sitting they came to me confronted me that this table is reserved by them. When I asked how many people they were reserving it for, they said four yet it was an eight-seater with two tables combined. In a shared dining environment, it would be great if the foreign staff could be more accommodating and understand local dining norms to create a better experience for all customers. Hope the management can address this issue.",
