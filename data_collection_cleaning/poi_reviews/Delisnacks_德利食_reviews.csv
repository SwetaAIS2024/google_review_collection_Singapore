LexTeo8888,1,"I have very rarely given a 1 star review as there are usually some good points to speak of for even the worst foods I've encountered. For this franchise stall, I'm making an exception as I can't find anything that can remotely allow me to redeem its reputation for one of the  the worst butterfly and yellow bean filled doughball I've ever eaten.

The doughball was like it's name, unpleasantly doughy in texture and I didn't know it was possible to render the yellow bean filling into almost dry powdery form.

Butterfly was just not edible.. that's my take as I don't want to waste time with this stall as it's likely not redeemable or going to change.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115467381167777606695/reviews

CK C,2,"Fried fritters (you tiao) was consistently good but the other items were bad. The ham chim peng (salted bun) was tough with little fillings while the tau suan contained too much corn starch. Also, everything served in disposables.

Staff were polite and E-payment was available.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
