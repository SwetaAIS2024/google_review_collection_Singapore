Ming Wei Lee,5,Fast and no frills ordering experience and u can get further discount if u join them on telegram or WhatsApp. Not sure about the size but I always seem to get a pretty large cup for my hot Americano. Would say that's a good value for money,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107724540457866476907/reviews

I paid $7.80 for a fizzy grape Americano using the app, but when I came to collect the drink, I saw that the price advertised on the board was $6.40. Which means that I was over charged by $1.40.

The barista explained that we should not refer to the board as the reduced price was only if you had a special voucher in the app (nowhere was this stated)

In other words, the menu pricing is deceptive and the real price for someone trying to purchase the drink is more expensive than the advertised.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101005401903077307138/reviews

I ordered an Oat Shakerato. The price displayed on the menu was $6.40, but I was charged $8. When I questioned the discrepancy, the staff explained that the lower price is only applicable with an in-app voucher.

Not every customer will have or use the voucher, and displaying a discounted price that requires a voucher is very misleading.

Public seating which I appreciate. The seating area often has an unpleasant smell. Admittedly, this seems to be a mall's issue rather than the kiosk’s responsibility.

The coffee itself is enjoyable, which is why I’m giving 2 stars instead of 1.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117202665405496417577/reviews

H S,2,"I am a matcha fan and decided to try the coconut matcha latte from this outlet of Luckin. It was the worst, grassiest tasting matcha I had and the sugar syrup tasted weird as well. The weird sweetness was overpowering even though I ordered least sweet, and the drink was not pleasant at all.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102044937227332426669/reviews
