Alvin Quah,5,"This is the best kindergarten you can send your child to. All my four children attend this kindergarten.

It is not expensive. They have a holistic program that expose your child to various subjects.

They teach your children life skills at meth and also Chinese hand opinion. The Chinese teacher speaks to your child only in mandarin, which helps stem learn the language.
