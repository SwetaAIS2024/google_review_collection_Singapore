The weekly sermons are so relevant, refreshing, and revelational. The people are warm, friendly, and genuine. The leadership is amazing, and all the Pastors have such big hearts for people!

This is a place where friends become family, and family becomes friends!
This is a place where you will feel believed in and truly belong!
This is a place where, if you are lost, alone, or in need, you will find hope, joy, peace, and love!

Jazby Gan,5,"A huge shoutout to Heart of God Church!

We had 14 pastors and leaders from New Life Restoration Church join the GenerationS Pastor Conference.

What an incredible experience it was! Under the leadership of Pastor How and Pastor Lia, God is raising up so many amazing young people who are making a real difference in this generation. This conference was a powerful wake-up call for all of us to value and empower the next generation!

Over these three days, their team went all out to make us overseas guests feel welcomed. Hanging out with them was so easy and warmâ€”it honestly felt like being with family or close friends. They donâ€™t just call their church a home; they made us feel like it was ours too!

And of course, a HUGE thank you to HOGC Pastors & Team 18 Global Hosts:

Julius Koh,5,"Been here for 17 years now (sorta grow up here). You donâ€™t see fireworks or dance performances all the time (in fact, maybe only twice or thrice a year), feels more like a club than a church, loud music and many young people dancing during their worship.

In fact, when you first walk into this church, you might think that it looks like a 5-star hotel, with â€˜butler servicesâ€™ (they are actually volunteers who serve as hosts!).

Lights, screens, cameras, cross-stage.

Look beyond all those that I mentioned. Stay around to hang, talk to the people. Youâ€™ll be amazed to find that itâ€™s not about â€˜Christians are all friendlyâ€™, but heart of God people are genuine.

My 4 y/o learns to serve people, be compassionate and look out for the needs of others and clean up after her own mess. Where else can I get such â€˜teachingsâ€™ for my daughter?

You gotta come and experience for yourself.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114066653902615339965/reviews

Calvin Cahyadi,1,"It's a cult that preaches the prosperity gospel. Stay away.
Try visiting one of your smaller neighbourhood churches, or expository churches instead :) Expository wise, I recommend Grace Baptist Church, Adam Road Presbyterian Church, and Redemption Hill Church. These churches (and many others) preach from the Bible in context and not from the preacher's agenda",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110301780097830718326/reviews
