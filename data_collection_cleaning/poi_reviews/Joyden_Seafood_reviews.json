      "text": "This is sensational dimmy!\n\nIt may have been a combination of the time of day and there only being a few occupied tables; because the food came out fast and piping hot.\n\nMy client and I came here for a late lunch and it was so good that we are both looking to have another meeting so we can return ASAP.\n\nNormal dim sum gets wheeled around on a trolley in endless laps of the restaurant - even though everything is sealed and steamed it isn’t always hot; but Joyden brought everything hot straight to the table.\n\nSui mai, char siu, BBQ pork buns and prawn dumplings were all standouts. The showstopper though was the Lobster noodles; we shared half the lobster each and both had gorgeous noodles underneath.\n\nThe staff were also fun and friendly with good banter!",

      "text": "Came here for their Lobster Porridge as it was highly recommended by one of our friend and also wanted to patronize this restaurant after i had a rather good lunch experience at Joyden Canton Kitchen in Hillview.\n\nWell, their Lobster Porridge was overall ok, Lobster meat was tender, firm with slight seafood food sweetness but broth for the porridge was abit too bland… lacks sweetness (Lobster broth should have) and could do with a little bit more salt.\n\nThe rest of the dishes that we ordered (Trio Of Eggs And Wolfberry With Seasonal Vegetable In Superior Broth, Beancurd and Black Pepper Beef Tenderloin) were Average but were more well balance than the Porridge.\n\nI personally liked their Yam Ring with Sweet and Sour Pork as the Yam Ring was Crispy on the outside and inside packed with smooth creamy Yam… Sweet And Sour Pork had also crispy outer crust and tender inside.\n\nTheir Signature Braised “Tai-O” Fish And Seafood Vermicelli was the next good dish. Its well cooked and flavourful.\n\nOverall, Service staffs were friendly, patient and attentive, but would prefer them not to have more than 2 staffs clearing the table, as its rather overwhelming and uncomfortable, when we just finished our last bite, sipping hot tea and wanted to chit chat for just awhile.",

Most of the dishes were really good.\n\nThe braised chicken dish was so flavourful, and the chicken has absorbed all of the essence in its meat. The lemongrass pork rib in the yam ring was mindblowing.\n\nThe pork ribs had a slightly fragrant lemongrass taste, and combined with the yam ring, it was such a delight.\n\nEvery dish that came up continued to impress, and I must say it was a very, very scrumptious dinner.",
