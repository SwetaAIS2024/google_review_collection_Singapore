C,4,"Great access point connecting Tanglin Halt to the Rail Corridor and linking easily to One-North. Well-constructed path that makes it easy to hop onto the relatively peaceful trail for a walk, jog, or cycle. From here, you can head toward Alexandra, Buona Vista, or One-North, depending on your route. Perfect for anyone in the Tanglin Halt or One-North area looking to explore the Rail Corridor.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
noel aye,5,"One of the earliest open entry points into the Green Corridor (now called Rail Corridor). Both bicycles and wheelchairs can access now since the new route, that has been designed with slopes instead of steps, is opened recently in 2022.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100571587233890832342/reviews
