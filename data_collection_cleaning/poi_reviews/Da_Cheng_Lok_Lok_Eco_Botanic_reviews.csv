Michelle Koh,5,"Food are nice and came very fast. If you cannot finish the food, feel free to ask them pack for you to takeaway. Sauces are available in 6kinds (from chili to Thai sauce to satay). Recommended to come here if you would like to have nice fried loklok that is still crispy even when you bring home. Have a try!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113005302051880474302/reviews
Eric Kee,4,"Lok Lok, la la  soup was nice, but wanton noodle was a bit salty, other then that it still taste good as the noodle was very springy and firm.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112727920133358300431/reviews
Gator,3,"Not really a lok lok person but tried them out nonetheless. The shop was clean and one could actually sit outside the shop around the parking lot area but of course, no air conditioning. But considering night time, it was doable.

I saw reviews saying that there’s this $1 lok lok which I didn’t see so i picked some items from the fridge but they were priced higher.

The fried items were overdone and very oily in my opinion. Some of them were dry and corners were charred, hence had a bitter taste to it.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
TH Koh,4,"Compared to the KSL outlet, i'd say that this one at Eco Galleria is a lot more hygienic because the indoor seating area is air conditioned. The price is the same at 1RM per stick. There is the option of boiling your items by yourself in a steaming pot of water instead of getting it fried.

The drinks here are ironically the most expensive part of the meal. One bottled drink set us back around 5RM, which is essentially 5 sticks.

Do drop by if you're in the area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107094247170799905974/reviews
fiona lee,5,"One of our favorite places for dinner. Love it they have expanded and increased their menu option with rice and noodles so that the kids can have a substantial meal in additional to the wide loklok variety available.

The fried items are done really well with no strong stale oil smell and not oozing with oil.

The chilli is super spicy, chilli lovers are in for a treat.

Price is reasonable at 1RM/stick with the exception of certain items that have their pricing labeled.

Service is quick and open air parking available all around.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103383816987469584671/reviews
