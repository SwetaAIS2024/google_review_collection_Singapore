      "text": "The name of the stall is a bit of a misnomer as the satay here follows the Singaporean Chinese way of preparing and serving satay as opposed to how the Balinese do it, which has typically thicker skewers served with sambal along with peanut gravy.\n\nI tried both the pork and chicken satays, which were both going for 90 cents per skewer. The pork ones were basically super juicy pork belly, marinated to perfection and grilled with a nice char, but the chicken skewers were a bit on the small side for the price.\n\nI loved that they used pineapple in their gravy just like how Hainanese satay sellers used to do it in the old days.I was also thankful how the ketupat was wrapped in coconut leaves instead of a ketupat shaped plastic wrap.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out if you're nearby, but if you're looking for the best value, go for the pork satay.",

Less than 15min.\n\nGodly\nTenderness and juiciness of meat. Mutton is toughest but I find it acceptable. But all are very juicy.\n\nPro\nPeanut sauce with lime. Nice value added dimensions to the otherwise slightly below average peanut sauce. Peanut bits were on the finer side. Also peanut sauce can be served in styrofoam cup rather than styrofoam bowl. It makes more sense, try it if you are reading this.\n\nChar taste of meat was great. Especially the pork belly. However I feel that it might not be worth twice the price. Don't get me wrong it does taste better but not at $1.60?\n\nMeh\nTaste. All meat were quite mild in taste even when not downing it with the already mild peanut sauce.",

Satay still tastes about the same as last time when the bosses grill. However the counter staff service is ridiculous rude and inflexible(even for walk ins).  I will stop patronizing this stall from now onwards. We are here just to order happy satay not to eat the counter’s staff anger.",
