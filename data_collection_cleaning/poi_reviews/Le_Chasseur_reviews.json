We enjoyed our meal there. Note that it’s non air conditioned, industrial coffee shop environment. Sufficient fans to keep the place well ventilated and cool. We had to swat a fly away while eating.",

Ngoh hiang was good with the dipping sauce.\n\nClaypot rice is cooked to order, hence takes time, so order this first, before deciding on other dishes.\n\nA big bonus is no MSG added, so you won't have that thirsty throat-feel after a meal.",

Waiting time was mentioned to be about 20 mins and was still acceptable for us.\n\nThe hot plate tofu don’t really look good but it sure is tasty!\nOrdered also the Yangzhou fried rice and again it doesn’t look appetising but the taste and rice texture was good.\n\nWell I was too engrossed to start the meal and didn’t took the photo of its presented state\n\nOverall will come back again if I crave for claypot rice",
