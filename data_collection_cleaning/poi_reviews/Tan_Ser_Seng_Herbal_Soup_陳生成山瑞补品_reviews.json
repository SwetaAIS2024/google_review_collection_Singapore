      "text": "Not the watery type. The broth is rich and delicious! Even if you don't like turtle soup, the herbal chicken soup is a great choice. Meat just melt off the bone.\n\nIf you are a fan of turtle soup, you have to try TSS. Do go for the claypot version when dining in. Choice meat and soup is more flavourful. Simmer longer and claypot locks in the heat and flavour.\n\nYam rice is fragrant and lots of mushroom slices and yam pieces.\n\nService is prompt and all the staff are polite and on the ball.",

      "text": "The food at Tan Ser Seng was truly delicious! We ordered the black chicken herbal soup and the double-boiled turtle soup—both were rich, flavourful, and comforting. The black chicken soup came packed with ingredients, especially tender chicken pieces. A nice touch was that the turtle soup came with a one-time free soup top-up, which we appreciated.\n\nWe also tried the jade tofu and prawn rolls, and both impressed us. The tofu was soft inside with a crispy exterior, while the prawn rolls were generously filled, with satisfying bites of chestnut adding great texture.\n\nEverything paired perfectly with the fragrant yam rice. To top it off, we were pleasantly surprised with a range of free ice cream at the end of the meal!\n\nHighly recommend this spot for soup lovers looking for a hearty, satisfying meal. Just a heads-up—the place can get quite warm, so bring a fan or dress light!",

      "text": "Had the ginseng black chicken soup with yam rice, along with crispy prawn roll and jade tofu for sides. The soup was rich and comforting, with a great balance of herbal flavor—not too strong, but still distinct. Generous portions of tender chicken made it even better. The yam rice was fragrant and paired beautifully with the soup.\n\nThe crispy prawn roll was my favorite—perfectly crunchy with a delicious mix of prawns and water chestnuts inside. The jade tofu had a satisfying crispy texture on the outside while staying soft inside.\n\nOverall, a fantastic meal with great flavors. Definitely a spot worth revisiting!",
