Has various bento choices with three sizes each.\n\nOrdered takeaway chicken teriyaki bento for lunch. Food looked great, everything was tasty, fresh, and well-seasoned. Would order again.\n\nAfter finishing my meal and researching a bit before finishing this review, I realized there is another stall at Maxwell road as well that is positively reviewed, and I can see why :)",
