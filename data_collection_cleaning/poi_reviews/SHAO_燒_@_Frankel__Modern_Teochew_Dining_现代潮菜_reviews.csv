Ryan Chee,5,"We had an amazing Chinese New Year dinner here, and the food was absolutely delicious! The standout dishes were the fresh oysters with garlic and chili, the marinated raw crabs, and the steamed crab with roe—each dish was bursting with flavor and beautifully prepared. The seafood was incredibly fresh, and the sauces complemented the natural sweetness perfectly.

The ambiance was warm and festive, making it a great place for a family gathering. A special shoutout to Lily for her exceptional service—she was attentive, friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed.

Highly recommend this place for modern Teochew cuisine lovers, and we’ll definitely be back again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100973497184942314236/reviews

We sat at the second level which is ok, just take note if you have people w mobility issues. Beer is acquired taste.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117325824621395254222/reviews
