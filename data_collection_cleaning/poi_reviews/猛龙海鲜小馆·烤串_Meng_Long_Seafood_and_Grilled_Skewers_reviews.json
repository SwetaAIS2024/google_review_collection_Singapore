      "text": "Chanced upon this zhichar place on social media by chance. Came here with my family last week for dinner. This stall is nestled within a coffeeshop by the roadside. There wasn't much customer while we were there. Food came shortly after we ordered.\n\nWe ordered a total of 5 dishes. Claypot beancurd, omelette, sweet and sour pork, stir fried baby kailan and ceral squid. Food was pretty decent, the stand out dish for me was definitely the sweet and sour pork. The food was also valued for money based on the portion.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the food but unfortunately we were also informed that their last day operation at this coffeeshop was 31 March.",
