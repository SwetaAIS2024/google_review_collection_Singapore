      "text": "Still same old rude character as of 03/10/2024.Worst minimart. Price is expensive and items look old and dusty. Mostly no price tag and be prepared to get charged high price depending on their mood.Both the lady and man not friendly and very rude as if we owe them something. Ask them politely but will talk among themself in Chinese,so where is my answer for my question? Left there blankly while they converse in Chinese. The man will follow you everywhere you go as if we going to steal their things and has no sense of manners at all.The lady at counter cannot converse in English at all but very rude.They don‚Äôt scan certain items and charge extra high for those items.Please be aware of that and ask them scan to know the actual price. Want to support them but if this is what I get in return,then bye bye to your shop which has dusty things and expensive. Get your manners right! Not recommended at all!",

      "text": "Let me just express my very bad exprience at your shop on 20th aug 2022. Here the story goes:\n\nI went to dovemart to get onion to cook for my lunch. I saw that the onions were not packed so basically to my understanding i have the very right to choose the onion and how many onion i want to buy. So i picked ONE as i needed to use it for that day meals only. I went to the cashier counter and was served by this old aunty. First thing she did when i handed over my onion (already placed in the plastic) was said \"HAIYO\" so loudly. Bare in mind, there were people at back of me queueing as well. Was she trying to embarrass me or something? Definitely  I have to comfront her. \"Why haiyo? What do you mean by haiyo? You have any problem?\" Funny thing was she only dared to remain silent. I have to get it straight with her told her off, \"aunty remember you are working in a customer service line and you are giving such a very bad impression to your customer.\"\n\nDear Dovemart, regardless what items customer buying, be it one or 10 items, please educate your employees to learn respect people, keep their comments to themselves and do their work right.",
