      "text": "Kitty and I decided to check out the Fei Zhu Lok Lok & Claypot LaLa Soup outlet in Ang Mo Kio after loving the one in Kallang Wave Mall.  Unfortunately, this location wasn't quite as impressive, especially after comparing it to our first experience at the Kallang Wave Mall location.\n\nWhile it was clean and had a nice ambiance, the variety of ingredients wasn't as extensive as the Kallang Wave Mall location, and the pricing was a bit confusing. We were disappointed to find that some ingredients were priced higher than advertised, and the taste of the lok lok didn't quite match up to the flavorful skewers we had at Kallang Wave. Kitty particularly enjoyed the fried broccoli, but even that didn't quite reach the same level of flavor as before.\n\nThe atmosphere at this outlet was quieter than the Kallang Wave Mall location, which might be a plus for some but not for others. The service was okay, but nothing special.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a great Fei Zhu Lok Lok experience, I would recommend sticking with the Kallang Wave Mall outlet for your first visit. It has a wider variety of ingredients, tastier food, and a busier atmosphere.",

Some ingredients look pretty old; with a huge amount of shaved ice in it, as if it was there forever. Options were pretty limited too.\n\nNo options for vegetables also.\n\nEnded up still picking a few. Total was $12 (among which were squid that cost $3 each).\n\nBut chilli is not bad. Especially the red one. Packs a punch.",
