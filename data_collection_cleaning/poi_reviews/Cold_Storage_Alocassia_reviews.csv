Alison Joy,1,"Chinese cashier lady in mid-20s, mentally challenged (I think) is getting too rude. Work attitude is horrible. Throws your purchases down on counter after scanning, does not pack your groceries even when your own bag has been passed in advance. Watches some video on her mobile when serving a customer!
It's been a while since she has been doing this but now it's way HORRIBLE.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102477971098017065179/reviews

to stretch over the counter to make payment on the terminal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114596800037941743140/reviews
