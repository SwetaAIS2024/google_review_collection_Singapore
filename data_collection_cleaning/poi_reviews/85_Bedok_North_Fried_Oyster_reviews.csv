Jacob Tan,3,"The orh luat issue is cooking time, you need to be crispy, and so your flour need fry longer, egg also. Ingredients, never play cheat, they give good ingredients and the oil is good oil. Oyster generous. Overall, fry crispier.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103495554616935818854/reviews
Paul Toh,3,"The oyster omelette is a little salty. Chilli sauce is also very salty. The flour is clumpy and not crispy.
The black carrot cake is slightly better. Not too sweet. I only wished it was slightly more charred.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110584107240453374/reviews
LW K,2,Char kuay tiao is tooo sweet. No wok flavor and basically a waste of calories. The fried oyster was also average. The saving grace is the fresh oyster and nice chilli sauce that comes with it. Wonâ€™t eat again.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113400502296066148691/reviews
C,3,"Oysters were plump and generous. Egg part was quite loose, chilli amount was good. The uncle cooks better than the auntie, so if you see the auntie is the one cooking on that day, you should probably skip it.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109477732884918793623/reviews
I W,3,"Ordered their Yuan Yang Fried Carrot Cake ($6) and Fried Oyster ($8).

Am not a fan of chunky carrot cake - their carrot cake has pieces that tend to be on the larger side.  Having said that, their carrot cake is not at all oily.  In fact, I had more oil on my face when I was an adolescent than the oil on their carrot cake.

So I'd say their carrot cake is not too bad, though certainly not among the best I've tasted.

Their Fried Oyster was a disappointment to me, although my wife felt it was ""ok"".  The dish was oily and the flour was clumpy.  Quite unlike other Fried Oyster dishes that I have tried, and not in a good way.

Yuan Yang Carrot Cake:  3.25/5
Fried Oyster: 1.5/5",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107686746966044708528/reviews
