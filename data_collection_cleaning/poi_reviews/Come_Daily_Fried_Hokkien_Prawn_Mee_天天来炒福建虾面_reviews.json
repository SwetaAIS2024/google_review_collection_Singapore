      "text": "30 minute wait time during the lunch crowd period, ordered the largest portion at $10.The dish came with 4 decently-sized prawns and sotong/squid, but no pork belly so I was slightly disappointed. The pork lard was actually added with the noodles during the cooking phase itself, which was interesting. The mixture of noodles in this hokkien mee was thick bee hoon + yellow noodles. I wasn't a fan of their chilli, but just my preference as I prefer sambal belachan for my hokkien mee. My immediate reaction when putting the noodles in my mouth was : \" wah supper eggy \", and it's quite evident from the photo that they add a lot of egg into their noodles. My major con however was this richness and sweetness from the noodles, perhaps MSG? This made the whole dish feel really jelak/surfeiting after 5-6 mouthfuls. Maybe not my preference so I don't think I'll be back, although I won't say that this is a bad bowl of hokkien mee. Staff were friendly though üòä",
