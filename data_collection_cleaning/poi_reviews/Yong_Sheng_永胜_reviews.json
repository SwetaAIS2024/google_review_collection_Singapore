      "text": "First time visit and decided to try their fried carrot cake, the white version. Order was smooth as there wasn’t anyone queueing at 9am plus in the morning. For $3.50 a plate, I thought it’s pretty reasonable. Taste wise, I felt it was ok, a decent plate of carrot cake but really not outstanding. Economical and Asian breakfast option and it’s good that now the hawker centre has some more stall options when it comes to fried hokkien mee, char kway Teow and cai tow kway.",

Tried a few times, so did not really id who is better.\n\nThe guy, elder one in my photo below fries well. The younger ones not so wonderful.\n\n--\n\nI am so happy that there is a new Hokkien Mee place. Ordered the big portion at $5.50. Chilli is quite good and noodles is well fried. Packed back home, still good. But too hungry to taste properly. Will definitely try again. 3.5-4 / 5\n*got sotong, 3 prawns, pork belly\n*small portion $4.50\n\n--\n\nBlack carrot cake $3.50 small portion is so so delicious. Dark sauce taste is thick and fragrant. 4/5.\n\nOpposite the Tiong Bahru fishball stall.\n\nNew guy on the block. Happy to try other dishes.",

I tried the carrot cake last week and It is much better than the stall that has been here for years which was supposed to be popular. Today I try this new stall fried kway teow and it is also very delicious.  They also offer other selection like fried Hokkien prawn noodles.  I can’t wait to try it soon. Let’s support this stall to keep it going. Thank you.\n\nBy the way, the store keepers were friendly chaps.",
