Ming,5,"I was there this afternoon to have better understanding on what lighting to get for my new house. Clement was there to serve me and explain to me they are still setting up the showroom. Apparently, they will be showcasing more products other than Philips products soon. Such as Haiku fan, Bertazzoni and etc. They are not doing retailing at this moment.

I suggest to visit in another few weeks when more products are being showcase!

Clement is friendly, courteous and knowledgeable!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109266908898358010064/reviews
Bea Tang,5,"We’re long time users of Phillips Hue bulbs. Although they are pricey, for smart bulbs especially where one requires dimmability, they are definitely superior to any others. Based on our past experience, we’ve just purchased a large batch of the recently released 400 lumen GU10 Hue bulbs and are looking forward to having them installed.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111363365766407649119/reviews
Mw Lau,5,Visited the Lightings showroom at Toa Payoh on 17 November 2023. My wife and I were impressed by the great service given by Mr Clement. He is extremely patient and has great product knowledge. Best of all he understands our need to explain and recommend the right lighting products. No pressure to buy; in fact he helped me to navigate to the online retailer to compare the prices. Clement is indeed an asset to Philips Singapore.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105643415859028286710/reviews
Cain Wong,1,Lousy place. There is not clear direction lead to light lab. The light lab will be close for 2 hours during lunch hour which is not mentioned in Google. Wasted my times and money.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112866131622520810627/reviews
