Shaf Jay,5,"Monday special- always loved the fried fish soup. Fish is cooked well, not too oily or salty. Soup is tasty , does not have the preservative taste at all. Set comes with a drink only for $8+, so worthy.

Fruits, kuehs & other delicacies can be found here,

The hot milk tea (teh tarik) is one of the best tea i had.
Tasted like a local coffeeshop.  Please try it :)

Generous portion and very affordable given it's location.
There is also a wide range of daily menu that is updated on their telegram page, reservations of food are allowed as well.

Clean dining area, not too crowded, indoor & outdoor seating available. Will always come back here for comfort food, everything here taste home made which is amazing.  Staff are friendly and do not rush us to order.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105139884679043278446/reviews
Jiayou,5,"A true hidden gem of Singapore right inside an expensive neighborhood

Came here while on business to renounce foreign citizenship, a great place with wonderful prices. People say it's probably for the workers nearby since you get additional discount if you have a worker card.

I sometimes order a second serving not because the portion is small but because the food is too powerful. Eat till you explode 11/10. Be aware that menu changes(rotates?) every two weeks so what you see in the pictures may not be there.

Oh yes the milk tea is great.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100999144101112923213/reviews
Olivia H.,5,"With the opening of more stations along the Thomson-East Coast mrt line, this is a gem of a place that I have come to treasure. Almost did not want to recommend as I would like to keep the tranquility to myself. Food reminds me of days gone where my parents brought me to RELC building or Sloane Court Hotel for lunch. I would say,  food is not pretentious and it's hearty. Fills one's stomach and the milk tea is to die for.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112646218704336894827/reviews
Lau Cherie,5,"OMG.. this is a quintessential little cafeteria on the ground floor of STB catering to the nearby working class at one of SG's most expensive district. I don't see much review on their breakfast but boy, I am certainly impressed with the breakfast that they serve. Toasted wholemeal bread with loads of vegetables, ham n fried egg and a cup of local kopi. It's nutritious, filling and extremely affordable at only $4.50.. considering the locality!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113144586847756324031/reviews
Lin,1,"Always love the ambience but I truly wish the serving staff could be more polite . Being new to the place I merely asked what was available to tea as there was nothing left on display. To which I received a very curt response “what do you want ?”

Even the foreign workers who patronise this place is treated with more respect ! Need I say more ???

As this is a cafe operating in the STPB premises, can we please bring back the “Speak Good English” campaign . Perhaps the young Malay lady is slightly deficient in this area !",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105325759968916780912/reviews
