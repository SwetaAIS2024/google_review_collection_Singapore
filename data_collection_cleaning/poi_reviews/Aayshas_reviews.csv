Eric Effin' P,4,"Dined 11 may.

Nice la.
All good.
Price was a tad high however.
But all was legit.
The naan was however below par.
But I tell you... The BUTTER CHICKEN. Like wowza!!!
Briyani was chalk full!
The nasi goreng could do with more meat IMO.

My son said he will come again for the butter chicken. So I guess it's good? üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101781764873773768564/reviews
YC Ng,4,"Although the cost of the roti prata is quite appealing, the portion sizes of the other dishes tend to be a bit modest. However, the decent quality of the food combined with the cozy and welcoming ambiance makes it a place worth visiting. Ideal for a laid-back meal, just remember to order a few additional dishes to fully satisfy your appetite.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118214011947792642159/reviews
Kaitlyn Nana,3,"came down on a friday night (6pm) and it wasn‚Äôt crowded! the store is clean and lovely decorated, which was really nice and welcoming! the smells as you step into this place is also really tempting ‚ú®

chicken briyani: 6/10, the chicken was dry and actually! i didn‚Äôt order this lol i ordered mutton briyani! you can look at the picture of the receipt. however i didn‚Äôt ask for a change, because both the chicken and the mutton were the same price so‚Ä¶ maybe i should have asked for a change if i knew it wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea‚Ä¶ i guess the good part is that the portion is quite big!

chicken fried rice: 10/10, bf‚Äôs order, it‚Äôs peppery and fragrant! also served hot i saw the steam coming off of it lol, the chicken was actually soft (chinese bf note: it tastes like chinese fried rice so maybe thats why i like it)

chocolate milkshake: 8/10, it was more liquid than slush-like, but i didn‚Äôt mind cos i liked the flavor, it was heavy on the chocolate taste, sweet and creamy! however i feel like $4 for this size was a bit muchhh

not an amazing experience, but maybe i‚Äôll be back to give it another try?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117959833968465624565/reviews
Julia Goh,5,"Best Indian food we had so far! Our favourite was the mutton masala, the meat was tender and flavourful.

Ordered other classics like the butter chicken and butter garlic naan üíØ

Thoroughly enjoyed dinner and would be back again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109162193813929860339/reviews
