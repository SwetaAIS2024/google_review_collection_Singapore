      "text": "This is what I called a \"quaint\" breakfast food shop, so you will be surprised with lots of familiar but uniquely prepared food.\nThe key ingredient here is soft kway teow of chee cheong fun. They make it in different ways: burnt form, thin sheets, thick sheets, presented in many ways. Such as curry, ipoh hor fun, laksa kway teow... a few more cheong fun new expressions.\nThe chinese biscuits are very very good. It's light and not densed, it has very well made ingredients inside, that are tasty and moist. You have to try it!\nThe Yong Tau Foo is also very tasty, the broth is rich and flavourful. The bittergoard, eggplant, beancurd sheets are all delicious and lightly savoury!\nThere are other local delights like Nasi Lemak, Rojak, Ipoh Curry Mee, Asam Laksa, they all looks so good (will try in the next visit). From the feedback of the customers there, they emptied their plates an looking very satisfied.\nTruly this is a great place to go for a local food bonanza, with innovative twists. I won't comment about their pork skin dishes, which is 100 saturated fat (cholesterol) that clogs up your arteries, and makes your heart are crampy at night...\nSo make time to go in the morning, have it slow, and enjoy it. Highly recommend it!",

The friendly staff here works hard to keep everyone satisfied.   Takeaway and dine in are welcome.  The pig skin curry is hard to come by, and so does the flavored beancurd.  The durian beancurd is highly recommended.",

The coffee was refreshing, and the noodles had a nice chewy bouncy and nostalgic taste. The CCF was quite fragrant as well. Was $15+ in total for 2 pax",

      "text": "The typical taste of Malaysian chicheongfun! Not the same as the Hong Kong style, and goes very well with curry and *fried bean curd* and pig skin! Another favourite is the pumpkin cake or the yam cake, both are so tasty! And if you’re a fan of northern cuisine, try the Ipoh white coffee! By the way pls bring your own containers to pack, to avoid packaging wastes!\nI personally would avoid curry horfun, as the chicken is bland, and curry is watered down by the horfun! Try the Ipoh Dry Horfun instead!\nRojak is authentic with crackers and without the ginger torch ingredient. Just tried the Porridge, it is good also!",
