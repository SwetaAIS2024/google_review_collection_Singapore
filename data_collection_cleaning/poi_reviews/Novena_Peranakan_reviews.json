I have been here a few times and the food has been consistently above par.\n\nThe menu selection is wide with prices clearly labeled.  There is only server/waiter serving the entire restaurant, so service may not be so prompt, but he is trying his best.\n\nHighly recommended! Thumbs up!",

      "text": "Home style Peranakan! taste wise they were all polite renditions of Peranakan fare, not explosive, so it may taste plainer than the modern Peranakan joints. But wow this is the closest fit to the flavour I had at Siglap 30 years ago. I slurped up the chapchye soup and didn’t get an MSG attack. The Itek Sio was nice and creamy too.\n\nImportantly the buah keluak still comes in the shell (it irritates me when it doesn’t). The otah is also allegedly made in house and I liked it.\n\nIt was always empty all these years so we never came in, but today I was lazy so I called to make a reservation and our experience was fine. The boss uncle does indeed have a little bit of attitude - he tried to tell us we ordered a lot (we didn’t), and dissuaded one of us from ordering a fried rice as it wouldn’t go well. He was also affronted when I dared ask if the otah was pre packed. Well he’s still open… so….. my recommendation is to just call ahead and reserve, and be respectful because the food’s worth the humble pie.",

      "text": "Update: Came back to try the assam pedas curry fish head together with other different dishes! Kept the ngoh hiang though cause I liked it the first time around, unfortunately Babi pongteh was sold out.\nThing to note: rice is free flow refillable after your first plate.\n\n———————————————————————\nDelicious nonya food cooked by only 1 guy in the kitchen. Everything was nice and very much above average but not perfect. My favorite would have to be their ngoh hiang which had very crisp bean curd skin on the outside.\nService can be rough at times as uncle who is the boss and taking orders from you can get stressed or moody when you first enter. However, he lightens up and gets better as service progresses.\n\nWill I come back? Yes because food is definitely decent",
