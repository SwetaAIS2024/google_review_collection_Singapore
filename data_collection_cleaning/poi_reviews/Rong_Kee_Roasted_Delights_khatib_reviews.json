Weekends may see a slight increase in visitors, but the spacious design ensures it never feels overly congested.\n\nAccessibility:\n\nLocated near Khatib MRT Station (NS14), the hawker centre is easily accessible via a short bus ride or a leisurely walk. Its proximity to Sheng Siong Supermarket allows for convenient grocery shopping before or after meals.",

      "text": "I had an appalling experience with Rong Kee Roasted Delights (Blk 848 Yishun street 81). The portion of meat was insultingly small, barely enough to satisfy a child, let alone an adult. It felt like a complete rip-off for the price paid. To make matters worse, they completely ignored my request for cutlery, leaving me without any means to properly enjoy the meal. This level of incompetence and disregard for customers is absolutely unacceptable. I would strongly advise others to think twice before ordering from this stall. Shocking quality and service. Not even deserve a STAR!!",
