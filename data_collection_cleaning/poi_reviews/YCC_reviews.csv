Hanks Lai,5,"Authentic Indonesian food!! Absolutely delicious! I tried Nasi Ayam Penyet and Cumi Bakar both were fantastic. The rich and spicy flavors of the spices were on point.

I'll definitely be back for more! Highly recommended!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105276504693151245852/reviews

Peter KCool,5,Authentic Indonesian food. The grill Squid is nice. But the flying fish is just ordinary fried fish and not fresh. They have 13 types of sambal. Managed to try on 3 types.

Ferrisca Jossem,2,"We ordered nasi ayam penyet, nasi cumi bakar and nasi goreng gila and oxtail soup...

For an Indonesian restaurant, their ayam penyet is nothing special, served with 1 small piece of tofu, 1 small piece of tempe and both are cold. There's like 5 pieces of pegaga leaves and it's yellowish....  I found this very disappointing...

The nasi goreng gila was served with 2 sticks of satay.... The nasi goreng is quite bland & not served hot....

Nasi cumi bakar is fine.. that's the best we have on the tables during our dinner .

Oxtail soup is a thumbs down.... We take about a piece and stop cause the meat is almost stale.

Overall , it's not a pleasant experience.. with the price charged, I think the customer deserves better food..

But, thumbs up to the staff for being so welcoming & attentive!!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106078568779977201389/reviews
Zalina Ismael,3,"First time trying out this place. As a whole, many shops were closed due to Covid so this was the best available option if you want to sit by the harbour and have halal food. Service was prompt and staff friendly. As it was a Monday, there was only one other couple there. Great ambience and the weather was kind as it was just after the rain. Food was okay. Squid was nicely grilled. Oxtail was tender. But the ""keropok"" was already ""soft"" and the mee rather sweet. Will come again to give their speciality set meals with clams, prawns, mussels and stingray a try. They also have 13 types of different ""sambals."" Only managed to try two this time round.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103980962520691441562/reviews
