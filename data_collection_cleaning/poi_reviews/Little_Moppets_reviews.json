The class has max 15 kids but its usually divided for activities so the student teachers ratio is quite good. Teachers are paying close attention to kids and send regular updates thru the app. We can see lots of development and changes in our son over 2 yrs with them. Overall very happy and highly recommended",

Deposit drag n drag to refund me. Excuse over excuse and I had to keep chasing them for payment instead of them updating me. Until today jan 2024 I still have yet to received my full deposit $1.7k refund ! If you ever enrol to this school good luck to getting your refund.",
