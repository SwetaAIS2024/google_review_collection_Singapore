We got to know him through a fish supplies store personnel and we should say that it was one of our best decisions calling him to consult about our ailing arowana. He was very willing to share his vast knowledge on arowanas and we learnt so much from him. We could also see his confidence while doing an op on our fish. Our fish is doing much better now. Thank you Mr Jaime for your excellent service.\n* Guys, pls don't hesitate to consult him for all your arowana related needs.",
