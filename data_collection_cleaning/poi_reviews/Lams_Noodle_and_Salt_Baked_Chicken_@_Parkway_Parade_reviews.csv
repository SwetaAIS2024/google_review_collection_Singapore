Johanna Chow,5,What can I say? Lam’s never disappoints. Got their salt baked chicken thigh & signature mee kia. Flavours been consistently good like all the other branches I’ve been too and it was such a hearty meal.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104436666547405320865/reviews
slugontheface,3,"Located at the Republic food Court in the basement of parkway parade,  this stall was originally made famous at the outlet at race course road.
The chicken is baked in a paper parcel with herbs. Meat is very tender but I thought the flavour was a bit on the bland side. The star of the show has to be the chilli sauce. I strongly believe that it gives the chicken more kick and makes the dish complete.
Nice comfort food.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106607444766699926579/reviews
Joshua Lim,1,"Came to this outlet (parkway parade) as we had a good experience at another outlet (causewaypoint). Long story short, food was pretty good, but the service was horrendous.

We visited this shop around 630pm on 16th July 2024, a Tuesday evening and it was pretty empty. We arrived at the store and were deciding on what to get. Spoke to the 2 male chinese staff running the store as referenced in one of the previous posts. I was clarifying the vegetables used in their mini hotpot and they replied in Chinese a few times. My Mandarin isn’t great and I was trying my best to understand what he was saying. After about 3 exchanges, he moved away and laughed to himself.

I proceeded to place an order with the cashier and he left mid order to prepare the first order. After that he asked for payment and I had to tell him I wanted to order more. He sighed and took my order anyways. After moving over to prepare the second order, he and the first guy were laughing whilst looking over. Granted they could have been talking and laughing about anything else, but it felt at that moment, as they were glancing over, that it was potentially about my poor Mandarin.

As we were collecting our food, we had the trays right at the entrance, he prepared the mini hot pot and left it beside the tray while rudely pointing and gesturing for us to put it on the tray ourselves. At that point we were done and just wanted to take our food and leave.

Overall, any of these incidences in isolation wouldn’t have necessarily pushed me to drop a review. However it was all these factors combined with the unprofessionalism, condescending and rude attitude of these 2 staff, that led me to post this.

I sincerely hope that the management would kindly look into grooming their staff to conduct themselves professionally and with respect towards their customers.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101167713213235376345/reviews

derek neo,4,"Salted Chicken Thigh is fresh,  but I felt the taste was not like what I remembered,  not salty enough.  Boiled chicken thigh with  rice is a more appropriate name for it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113015523826545524096/reviews
