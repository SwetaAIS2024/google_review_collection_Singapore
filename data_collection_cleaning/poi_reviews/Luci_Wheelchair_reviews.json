      "text": "My wife has had troubles with her foot for months and tried all the usual treatments.  I suggested we hire a wheelchair as we were going on a 21 day cruise out of Singapore.\n\nAn hour and a half before we had to embark she decided she needed a wheelchair!  This service saved us and delivered a folding wheelchair to our hotel within 50 minutes of making payment!\n\nThe wheelchair was perfect for our needs and meant we got to do things and go places we otherwise would not have been able to.\n\nThe whole booking, delivery and pick up arrangements were super fast, efficient and the cost was reasonable as well!\n\nI would highly recommend this service to anyone.\n\nThanks",
