Gin Nah Lim,5,"Educators at Guru Kids Pro are not only dedicated to helping their students achieve optimal exam results. They also emphasize applying learning concepts to everyday life. When the subject is relatable, the learning is more practical, permanent and enjoyable.

Bee,5,"I have been a student here for 4 years so far and Teacher George has been one of my best Maths teachers I’ve ever met. He is dedicated to the subject and gives each student personalized tutoring. Teacher Katherine whom I’ve also been taught English by had also helped me with writing compositions. They both use fun and engaging games to spice up the lessons and those games are something I always look forward to. Thanks to them, I scored well for my PSLE. :)

Rainflo,5,"In Guru Kids Pro Teacher Katherine has helped me focus on my areas of weaknesses and build up my skills for English as I prepared for PSLE. Her lessons were very enjoyable and insightful, helping me to appreciate English more and learn answering techniques for different aspects in paper 2. In addition, her advice and guidance for the compositions I write allowed me to expand my vocabulary and structure my story plot better.  I feel like I have really grown my passion for English through her lessons and would recommend others to go for her classes as well.

Wendy Wong,5,"Teacher Katherine has been very nurturing and attentive to my three kids needs in terms of their different abilities and strengths. She gives me feedback on them so that I can also manage my expectations. Her classes have puzzles and games that encourage them to think outside the box and use critical thinking skills, which is lacking in other enrichment classes that just focus on school curriculum and homework. They love going there every week, it’s their favourite class!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105619430957807819100/reviews
