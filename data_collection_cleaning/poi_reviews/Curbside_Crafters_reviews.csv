Abigail Torres,5,"Such a cute store to get unique gifts at! It has lots of different booths and payment is straightforward (if you live in Singapore). If visiting, payment has to be done in cash and it has to be exact change. It is definitely worth it to have enough cash, just be sure you have enough! The staff is super friendly and you can get on lots of items. Our favorite was Requisite, unique jewelry and very high quality, affordable and watches.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111824577213825052098/reviews

Jessica,5,"Genista Lane coffee cart at the shop front certainly helped gather crowd and bring traffic into the bazaar. We had a good time. Our loots were: 2 silk screen-printed kitchen towels, a crocheted Pochaco charm and an illustrated book — Lil Ducky Dreams of Adventuring. It’s a 2-storey space that has a couple of small food stalls within too. We had fun!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103149138135133792217/reviews
