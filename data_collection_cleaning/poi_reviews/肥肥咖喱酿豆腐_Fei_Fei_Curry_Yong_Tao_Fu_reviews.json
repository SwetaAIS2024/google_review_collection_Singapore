Taste wise is alright...better than average but nothing to shout about.",

      "text": "Excellent bowl of curry Yong tao fu in Sin Ming area. The ingredients are really fresh and price point is affordable as well. For me, the secret lies in the creamy curry. Not overly spicy but yet has enough heat to it. The star ingredients were the fried egg plant, wu xiang ball and fish ball. Something that makes this stall stand out from the others is that the aunty will serve it to your table. Hence the 5 star for service. Really enjoyable and worth a return trip.",

      "text": "$3 for 6 items (minimum)! Super value for money. Hard to find in Singapore nowadays.\n\nGreat service too. Auntie served me the Yong Tau Foo Soup at the table.\n\nThe Yong Tau Foo items were fresh tasting. Each item was full size too. The stall owners didn't try to skimp on ingredients just because the Yong Tau Foo pieces were priced lower than most places. The soup was pleasing though not outstanding. Even the sauces were thick and enjoyable, not watered down.\n\nOverall, an above average Yong Tau Foo stall.",

The fried tofu was flavorful and the veggies were cooked just nice, neither too tough nor too soft. Aunty even served me my bowl at the table. It was 7.30am and there was no queue, so I got my food within 10 minutes or less. Definitely worth coming back for.",

The serving is huge, I thought of going easy on an early morning, but I am wrong, so full! The YTFs are hand made and the price is very cheap. This will certainly be my go to place on every Saturday morning.",
