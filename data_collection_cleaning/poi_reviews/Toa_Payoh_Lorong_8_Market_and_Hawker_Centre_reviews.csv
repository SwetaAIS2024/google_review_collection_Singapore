Melvin Chan,4,"Four seasons chendol was the best of the 3 dishes tried, especially if you have a sweet tooth, whatâ€™s not to like about generous gula melaka and coconut milk, chendol was soft, red bean was good, came with two attap chee. Tian Tian carrot cake was average, a little salty and even sweet to me. Changi Village Hokkien mee was average also, the dry type. Wonâ€™t make a trip especially for a the dishes but ok for a normal lunch if happen to be in the area.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104576734416040440324/reviews

Yun Yi Thiam,4,"Toa Payoh Lorong 8 Hawker Centre is a fantastic spot with a great variety of affordable food.

I always come here with my parents for the Teochew porridge, fruit juice, popiah, and Hokkien mee! Personally, I prefer the Teochew porridge stall with the orange plates, especially for their braised pork and chicken wings ; very homely and comforting. The other stall, however, offers better steamed fish and braised duck.

Itâ€™s a reliable and satisfying place for good hawker food!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117032018297036757369/reviews
