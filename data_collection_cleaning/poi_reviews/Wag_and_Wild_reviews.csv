Ryan mcw,5,Kaine is always so helpful and passionate about his job. We feel safe letting our dog swim here under his care. My dog always enjoyed the time here!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100199613190875824175/reviews
KY Loo,5,"Possibly my dogs' favourite place in Singapore. They go crazy for the pool and you can literally hear them whining in excitement a mile away.

We love that it's really spacious and even on a crowded slot, there is more than enough space for my dogs.

The staff, especially Kaine, is very on the ball with keeping the pool safe and clean for the dogs. I usually bring my own toys and have left my toys behind accidentally. Kaine actually kept them safe for me till my next visit! We also really appreciate that he steps in at times to advise owners when their dogs need help with learning how to swim!

And yes, we are also huge fans of the friendly boss, Alex! Thanks for having such an awesome space for my dogs!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117707316930394683472/reviews

GA YA,3,We took our 3 doggies to swim. The place is a bit run down. For the price there is no shampoo or drying facilities. Now we know and can bring it with us next time. No checking status of vaccinations neither. Very under staffed although the person at the entrance tries his best. Doggies had fun anyway,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107030149869065027484/reviews
JC wee,5,"Lovely environment, visited on a Sat afternoon and upon entry, was welcomed by staff : Kaine.

Rules explained by Kaine, we found ourselves in the pool within few minutes after borrowing doggo jackets!

Nice pool temperature, lots of chairs around for humans to be on for resting, and lots of nice accessories like a slide, balls around and big floats for our doggo to chill down.

We extend out utmost appreciation to Kaine, as upon our leaving, we realised that we didnt bring our own dryer. (The facility provides sockets outside, but not dryers, u gotta bring your own dog blower or like a dyson hairdryer).

Kaine however offered to lend his his personal one, which we are very thankful for.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102910936163845729354/reviews
