Chen Family,3,"Brightly lit, newly renovated food court. Service was friendly, little bit of a wait to takeaway. Bought the twice cooked pork and a veg dish, both tasted very similar. Price was quite high, and it was a bit too salty and oily, overall.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118145836301674418853/reviews
TPCentralHuser SDO,1,"Did not try the fish; we simply ordered what an earlier patron\customer ordered (& collected).  The ""ma"" 'ness was good.

BUT agree with latest review. BOTH dishes were just too ^damn^ salty!!!  My heartrate totally spiked with the amount of salt in both dishes‚ù£Ô∏è
Cook either did not taste-test or was really *very* generous this evening.  üòí

Later, we did see \ notice the earlier customer (who ordered same dishes below) throw away more than half their portions!!  Guess we were just being too nice; brought up to not waste food, no matter how awful. _sigh_",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116113274991859571402/reviews
jessica aprilianti,5,"Probably the best spicy chicken ever. They seem to use two kinds of dried chilis giving a complex spicy flavor

Alex,2,Disappointed with the $7.80 malatang set as there's no meat at all inside the bowl. It's just vegetable inside. They should indicate it's a vegetarian malatang. Felt cheated.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106097709609821008050/reviews
