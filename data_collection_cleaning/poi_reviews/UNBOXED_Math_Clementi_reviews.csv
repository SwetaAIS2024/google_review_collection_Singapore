Nicole Loo,5,"The teachers there are passionate and patience especially Teacher Faith. She is very encouraging, and putting 110% to teach and guide the students. The class size small and teacher able to pay more attention for each students. My son’s E-math & A math improved tremendous. He scored A1 for both in his O level ! Highly recommend.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111200716937877916303/reviews
Wei Yang Chia,5,"I completely don’t regret joining Unboxed. All the teachers there are very caring, and they always ensure that you understand the topic that they are teaching by fully. They are also very friendly, so their students won’t be afraid to text or ask them enquiries. The teachers at Unboxed even keep track of their students’ test dates so that they can fully prepare them for the exam. I am super grateful to my math tutor, Teacher Faith. She’s an absolutely dedicated and amazing teacher. Through her guidance, I was able to pull my hopeless math grades up to an A2!!! It’s a great tuition Centre, and I would recommend it :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115486491328491441797/reviews
LQ Tan,5,"My daughter enrolled in UNBOXED math (Clementi Branch) when she was primary 5 after term 2 after she scored badly for her math weighted assesment 1 and got AL5. After since, she joined UNBOXED, she improved significantly and got AL1 for her weighted assesment 2! After seeing her amazing results and improvement, I was immediately impressed by UNBOXED teaching! After that, my daughter continued to ace her exams, she even got AL1 for her end of year exams! Even though this is partly because of her effort, i know UNBOXED teacher Lovey has also helped her in improving, thank you so much UNBOXED for helping my daughter improve!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109736506214001503755/reviews
calynn Tan,5,"When I first joined unboxed I didn’t like math and never really excelled in it. However, after joining unboxed through a recommendation from a friend of mine, I started to improve and develop a love for math. In fact, Math is also now my strongest subject and I have able to excel in it. I’m really glad I decided to come to Unboxed as it helped me improve significantly with the help of the teachers’ guidance and patience.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103837969300906012436/reviews
