Matthew Leong,5,"if you are a fan of springy, soft, slightly chewy prata this is a absolute must-have...the fish curry is just nice - not spectacular...still definitely worth a visit!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104317323840120506939/reviews
Priya selvanathan,5,"Friendly and nice owner! Serves food generously from the heart!
I tried the biryani with their sides. Very homestyle and humble cooking! Tasty with no added colouring or additives. A neighbourhood must try! My regular favourite!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110989474207275764321/reviews
Benedict Chua,4,"Long queue, but moves pretty fast due to fast service staff. I am not a fan of prata stalls over-preparing the prata and leaving it in the tray, but for stalls with mass orders like theirs, I think it is okay. The prata that is mass-made still taste hot, crispy. Fish curry has a very bright orange hue, unlike regular stalls with seemingly diluted curry. Though fish taste not that strong, leaned towards more good-tasting vegetable curry instead.

The idiyappam came straight out of a packet, for 2.40$, and the coconut flakes did not have a slight crunch to it, tasted bland. Props to the swift business and good pre-making bulk.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111915063884081471920/reviews
Edward Wong,4,Paid $1.30 and $2.10 for each plain and egg prata respectively. The plain prata was crispy on the outside and has buttery taste. The egg prata was tasty too. Fish curry was delicious. Service was friendly but there was no tray provided to carry my plates of food. Queued for 30 minutes.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173188680901424865/reviews
Eva Cheong,5,"Very good prata in CCK area.  However, the coffee shop is very messy and cramped. It's difficult to get seats during peak hours. Tables for smokers are just beside. Making the air so stuffy.

The coffee shop should do a makeover so that dinners can have a more pleasant dining experience there.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102713619364843072595/reviews
