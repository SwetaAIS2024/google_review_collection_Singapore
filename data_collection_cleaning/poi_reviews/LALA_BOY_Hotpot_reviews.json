Will try the shrimp paste next time.\n\nThe service is pretty good too - attentive but do note that quite a number of the workers are foreigners, so their English & Chinese are not great.\n\nAnd I love the ‚Äòhanging tissues‚Äô! And they also provide free snacks.\nHighly recommended, will definitely be back again & again & again ‚Ä¶.",

We had the lala hotpot and added some other dishes like pork belly and some vegetables.\n\nThe broth was good as the lala served was fresh. We added some Chinese wine which patrons could readily used placed on the condiments table.\n\nService was very friendly and forthcoming which we appreciated. The price was reasonable.",

      "text": "Good service as regularly top up soup. Soup taste nice, not too salty and a bit on peppery side. Nice touch with the fire show of cooking lala giving the soup a smoky taste. Lala was fresh, not muddy unlike past reviews. Enjoyed the idea of hanging tissue (a different touch). Overall, the ingredients were fresh, recommend fish skin, pork belly, canbage and bean curd rolls. Nice touch of snacks at doorway, service crew was friendly esp the Chinese guy. Spent rm160 on 4 adults (did not eat too full as keeping tummy for dessert), left feeling satisfied. Never pressured to order more. Price a bit high for Malaysian standards to visit on regular basis due to location. Was 80% full on a Sat evening.",
