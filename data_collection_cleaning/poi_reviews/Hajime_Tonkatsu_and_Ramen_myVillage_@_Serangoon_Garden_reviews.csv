Rene Lee,5,"Their oyako don is nice and quite authentic!! It has a light but nice taste with delicious sauce and eggs. One of the more authentic oyako dons I've tasted in Singapore and it's worth it. Will come here next time for the Toji and Tonkatsu!!

Update:
Tried their Toji Pork Loin set. I think the sauce is really nice and is a little different from other places as it has that bit of sweetness which I like.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108481221892893207863/reviews

Sera // IG: diningwithsera,5,"Imagine having quality, value-for-money Jap cuisine by SG‚Äôs 1st Tonkatsu chef !! Their pork loin is air flown from Japan, sauces are homemade and they have the warmest hospitality.

We tried their premium pork loin set, which consists of tender & juicy air-flown Kagoshima Sangen pork, coated in delicate, crisp & non-greasy breadcrumbs. It's paired w crunchy shredded cabbage that‚Äôs washed in ice-cold water (best w light Wafu dressing), Niigata rice, Tonjiru soup (MSG-free savoury pork bone broth w veggies & yuzu - we loved this), & ground roasted sesame (add to their Tonkatsu sauce). Their dedication to quality is evident, & for the price?? So damn worth. Also did i mention refillable cabbage and rice? Perfect for big backs.

We also enjoyed their Nagoya miso fillet which was also beautifully tender, fried w red wine & tonkotsu broth, paired w miso sauce handpicked from Nagoya.

We ordered their ebi fry ramen to try, which entails QQ Nama noodles in a secret Sakura Ebi paste infused w their Tonkotsu base broth, & finished w a dash of chilli oil. This came w freshly-breaded & fried ebi which was pretty decent in flavour & texture.

Had a few sides, including:
agedashi tofu, which is made with delicate batter infused w yuzu & fried in soybean oil. Refreshingly crisp w/o being too oily.
Their torikawa (grilled chicken skin) is crunchy with a juicy interior, and absolutely umami-packed.

They also provide complimentary water and tea !!
Overall, if you‚Äôre looking for exceptional tonkatsus with unbeatable value, this is a must-try :)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118301436723641326928/reviews
Ken Peh,5,"When I read the reviews and website that the chef is from Tampopo, it is a MUST TRY already. For Singapore people and even Japanese expatriates, I believe Tampopo is a well known brand name to you. Even the Japanese in Singapore, they agree that Tampopo is very authentic and as near as what they have in Japan. Hence when I read that chef Tan San was previously helming there, it definitely is going to be good. And yes it has the same taste üëç

Very cosy dining place at Hajime. The rice and white cabbage are refillable. Ice green tea is also complimentary. Tonkatsu sauce is one of the best I've tried in Singapore. Most of the sauces from other restaurants are either too bland or too strong, taking over the fragrance of the Tonkatsu. But in Hajime, the sauce taste is 100% just nice to the point. Business is very good. By 12pm the seating is 100%. The serving staff is very courteous, walking around to offer refills for customers. SUPER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you are a fan of Tonkatsu, you can't miss this place. üëç",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
Cheryl Tan,5,"It‚Äôs always great having dinner at Hajime. The tonkatsu here is top quality and always consistently good. In particular, they don‚Äôt compromise on hygiene. In the photo, it shows the menus cleaned and propped up to dry. That‚Äôs how it should be. Kudos to the team of well managed staff!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117271033601210753645/reviews
