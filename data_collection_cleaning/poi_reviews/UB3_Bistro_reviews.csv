oscar w,5,"Bistro with nice friendly vibes，  located in middle of industrial area. not too crowded when we visited on a Thursday night. suitable for gathering. With indoor and outdoor tables. Nice range of craft beer, they allow you to try the beer if you're not sure which to get. Food was above average too, favourites are the leg of lamb and blooming onion.  Excellent hospitality by XT and Hakim making our session a happy and memorable one.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111622338660084561466/reviews

Food was pretty good … I must say we did really enjoy the dishes .

However choices of craft beer wasn’t to our liking .… thus , a pity .

Shawn Phang,5,"So I was really craving a blooming onion and this was one of the better places that popped out.

Did not disappoint.

There's a nice range of craft beer on tap and we got to try a sampler before making an order.

The beef short ribs have nice texture and beefy flavour, miso salmon is not too dry and has crispy skin.

The servers are friendly. Overall a pleasant experience, definitely worth a try. Won't be our last time!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115785584731437394075/reviews
Lin Lin Wong,5,"10/5 stars! UB3 Bistro exceeded my expectations in every way!

The Mangalica pork was to die for - the fats literally melted in my mouth. Paired with the addictive rice puff side dish, it was a match made in heaven!

The ribeye was cooked to perfection (medium rare), and the blooming onion was crispy and flavorful, with a delicious accompanying sauce.

The tomato feta salad provided a refreshing contrast, while the jalapeño cheese was creamy and addictive. And don't even get me started on the Brewlander Guanabana beer - refreshing, sour, and utterly delightful!

Great staffs who attended to us and thank you Alec for introducing the dishes to us!

Great atmosphere as well, toilet was outside but the toilet was very clean as well.

Can't recommend UB3 Bistro enough! Exceptional food, great service, and a fantastic atmosphere. Can't wait to come back!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103480820613593245224/reviews
Cc Lim,5,"I stumbled upon UB3 Bistro while searching for a cozy spot to work between appointments, and what an amazing find it turned out to be! The food here is absolutely phenomenal, crafted by the talented Chef Alec, who happens to be Mauritian and highly knowledgeable.

With 11 taps to choose from, it's a beer lover's paradise—what more could you ask for? Their monthly specials are an absolute treat, and I can't stop raving about the lamb rack, Hungarian pork (check out the photo!), blooming onion, and braised beef. Every dish is a burst of flavor and cooked to perfection.

The ambiance is relaxed and inviting, filled with positive vibes, making it the perfect spot to chill or catch up with friends. Chef Alec and UB3 Bistro have truly created something special. Highly recommended!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105160339584781011099/reviews
