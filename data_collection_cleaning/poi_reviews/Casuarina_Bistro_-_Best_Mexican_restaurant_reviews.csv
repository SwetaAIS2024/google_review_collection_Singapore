Gooose,4,"First time to this restaurant. They do serve more than just Mexican food with western and Indian food available as well. I was there for Mexican food and we had nacho and tacos and chimichangas. Food was quite good and the fish tacos are worth a mention. Prices are decent and portions are decent.
Overall this place is a unique combination of food range, restaurant and bar. Will return for beer and food the next time in the evenings.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112758192712209103259/reviews
Jeremy Khoo,5,"Celebrated my son‚Äôs birthday dinner here on a Thursday evening. We ordered different types of nachos, tacos, quesadillas, burritos and chimichangas to share and all were delicious, authentic and were large portions at reasonable prices. There was also a beer promo for 3 pints for only $30. Service was quick and attentive probably because there was only one other group of customers. It was pretty quiet for dinner. Will definitely come back to try their other Mexican dishes.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101975552015179312270/reviews
Wei Kiong Tan,2,This is a place with identity crisis. I guess there is Indian influence trying to be a Mexican restaurant. Food is decent and fairly priced. However ambience is wrong and the staff needs more training. Overall will not be revisiting. There are much better Mexican restaurants,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110946312523796255964/reviews

Veena Ang,5,"Our server Sunder - very friendly and helpful guy - recommended their signature fish tacos and lo and behold the best fish tacos I‚Äôve ever had in 2025! The combination of the spicy sauce, guacamole, sour cream and the slaw together with the fish tacos that was PHAT and juicy, crispy outside and tender inside. Amazing stuff! Will be coming back for this.

On the other hand, tried the steak which looked unassuming BUT the cut is so good?! Though a tad overdone, it was simply juicy and tender and the fatty parts melted in my mouth creating the most amazing steak taste. Pasta was supposed to be aglio olio but it came with a tomato paste? Tasted good though I liked it ü•∞",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101237319012046270354/reviews
