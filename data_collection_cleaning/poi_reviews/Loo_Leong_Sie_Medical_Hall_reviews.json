      "text": "Visited the Loo Loong Sie Oil warehouse during the KAPOW event, and it was such a delightful experience! From the moment we exited the lift, we were greeted by a comforting, familiar scent of medicated oil, which immediately brought back a sense of nostalgia.\n\nThe family running the business was incredibly warm and welcoming. A lovely couple and their son took the time to share the history of their brand, and it was clear how passionate they are about their craft. Hearing their stories added a personal touch that made the visit even more special.\n\nExcited to try their home brand oil we bought! If the warmth and care they showed during my visit are any indication, I’m sure the product will be just as wonderful. ÷)\n\nHighly recommend stopping by if you get the chance—it’s not just a purchase, it’s an experience!",
