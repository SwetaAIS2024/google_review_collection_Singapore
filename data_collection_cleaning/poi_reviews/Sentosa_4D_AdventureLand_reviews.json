Personally I like the log digital roller coaster experience. The 4d movie being a old concept is a good experience for the kids as they never tried it before. Very helpful and friendly staffs at this facility.",

But all the staff were so lovely and accommodating!\n\nThe 2 4d rides are pretty cool, the seat moving is a bit more powerful than most of the rides at universal, so be careful small children may not like this.\nVery good for most adults, unless you have neck/back problems.\n\nThese rides have improved a lot over the years!",

Bought 3x rides for parents and kids but kid was scared after 1 ride, so we wasted 2 rides as we were not allowed to let our adult family members use the other ride credits that we paid for.  There was no queue and not many customers - They would rather play the games to empty rooms than to allow flexible use of credits and improve their customer experience. Sentosa, you can do better than this.",
