There's a lot of shops here, multiple floors, and a few link bridges, depending on where you want to go. There's quite a lot of amenities here, so you can come with your family and friends. Overall, a great shopping experience in Bugis!",

Its also fitted with air conditioning. So it was actually pleasant.\n\nThere were a number of shops here. It's a standard shopping area. What i like about this place is its close proximity and easy access to other places. Bugis Street, Victoria Street, Bugis + are all nearby.\n\nOh ya, we were tired of all the walking and rested here with ice cream from McDonald.",
