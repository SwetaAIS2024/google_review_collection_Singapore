The soup is not the usual peppery taste kind that most chicken rice stall provided, theirs has got a rich taste of chicken broth.\n\nChicken drumstick (without bone) + egg, only $6. Very value for money.",

Strangely, there was still one whole chicken hanging there, but they told me it was only for customers ordering half or whole chickens.\n\nFound it quite amusing how this store does business—apparently, they’d rather turn away customers than sell what's left. Not exactly the most customer-friendly approach.",
