Jon L,4,"This review is for the IRVINS location at Orchard Gateway. It is a kiosk on the ground floor selling IRVINS products. While the brand has expanded to the US, the product line is different and does not include its most famous product, salted egg fish skin. Bought a pack of the salted egg fish skin here which was delicious with a rich and savory flavor. If you go to Singapore, I would recommend picking up this item given that it is still not available in the US.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105877892124929952379/reviews
