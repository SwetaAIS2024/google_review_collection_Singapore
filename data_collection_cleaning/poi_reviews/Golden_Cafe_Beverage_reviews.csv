桃田太郎,4,"Order the cocktail ice kachang!
Is $3.5 higher than the market price? I thought so, but
There are a lot of toppings inside the ice, such as azuki beans, atapuchi, and jelly, so it might be quite cost-effective.
Is there an ice cream shop near here? So it's useful 😋👍",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114961188011114023235/reviews
