I don't usually eat a lot of rice but because it was delicious, I finished the entire plate by myself. Will definitely come back to check out the other menu items. In my opinion, the fried rice here at Fried Rice Story tastes better than Wok Hey.",

Really love the Thai sauce which elevates the taste even more.",
