Travel With Jack Chee,5,"There’s actually a little Jakarta town in the heart of Orchard Road. The “J” in Jtown Café is short for Jakarta and not Japan, as you may guess if you are looking at its name. Serving Bakmie and other Indonesian street food, this halal-certified eatery is well known among the Indonesian community and has been operating for more than a decade

I had arrived at 1.30pm on a Sunday for my lunch here. Although it is packed with people, mainly Indonesians, I managed to locate a table quickly. As this eatery does not impose a service fee and tax, I had to queue to order my food at the counter. Fortunately, it was fast and orderly, and my food arrived in 5mins.

There is a sizeable selection of noodles, rice and side dishes offered here. For lunch, I ordered the following:

* Crispy Chicken Rice - $7.90
* Crispy Chicken Bakmie - $7.50
* Mee Goreng - $6.90
* Beef Ball Soup (8 Pieces) - $6.50
* Happy Soda - $2.80
* Lychee Iced Tea - $2.80
* Iced Green Tea - $2

Although the Mee Goreng tasted salty, its handmade noodles deserves a mention. I enjoyed the Crispy Chicken which was well marinated and fried to perfection. The star of the dish is the Beef Ball, which tasted tender and chewy.

The total cost of my meal is $36.40. I found it to be affordably priced, in consideration the dining establishment is in Orchard Road. I would love to visit this place again as there are many delectable Indonesian dishes which I have yet to try.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113016090208525039802/reviews
LP Pua,4,"It's a small eatery with high customer turnover, located in the middle of Orchard Road, selling Indonesian cuisine. Ordering was straightforward, but paying electronically was a nightmare due to no telco reception inside the shop. The food was above average and good value for money, considering the price and location.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Henry Cheng,5,"This place has been around forever and this is the first time I’m trying it after more than 10 years in Singapore. Located within Midpoint Orchard in the basement area opposite the food court. The fried crispy chicken with rice was divine. Served with a thick sweet sauce and some crunchy onions, it really ties everything together. The Green chili bak mie was quite spicy even though it doesn’t look like it. Noodles were bouncy and delicious. The minced chicken was seasoned very well in the sauce as well. As recommended by many people, I decided to try the meat balls as well. I’m happy to say I’m not disappointed. Delicious meal with wallet friendly prices in the heart of Orchard",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151994390288524704/reviews

Hartono Harjono,5,"Located in Somerset, the store is easily spotted on the basement level. It's big, spacious, and has many seats available. They offer a wide variety of Indonesian noodles (bakmi), mostly spicy. Bakmi ayam popcorn is a good choice if you don't like spicy food. Complement your meal with crackers and teh botol Sosro. The staff provides good service. Highly recommended!",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102944719141464210600/reviews
