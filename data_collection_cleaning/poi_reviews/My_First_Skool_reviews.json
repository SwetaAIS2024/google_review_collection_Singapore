The teachers are well trained and follow up with the developmental, learning and well being of my daughter. Principal Ms May has been the most amazing principal all these years. She really took care of our concerns and the well being of all the children. She communicate and interact with parents and the rapport we had with her was extremely fantastic. My daughter is going to miss the fun and learning experiences she had with her friends and teachers but i definitely know that her journey moving forward to primary school is going to be a smooth one. She learned all the skills that has been taught to her since day 1. Thank you JW6 teachers especially K2 Liu Laoshi, teacher Wanyi and Ms May for the guidance and love u gave to my daughter.",

      "text": "My daughter has been with this branch since she was an infant. The principal and teachers are very helpful and professional. They takes good care of my child, give timely updates of her progress. Principal, Ms May Teo, has been very responsive to all my queries especially during covid period when there were disruptions to classes. When covid hindered outdoor play for the kids, the teachers replaced with fun activities to engage the children, this showed how committed and passionate the teachers are. Overall, my experience with this branch has been pleasant. My daughter likes all her teachers from infant to now nursery, she is progressing steady and always a happy girl in school. Keep up the good job, JW6!",

During this COVID period, the staff has shown to take extra initiative to keep the parents updated and keeping the center operational as much as possible as per accordance to the  regulatory guidelines.\nFinally would like to say Thank You to the teachers, principal and staff for a job well done.",
