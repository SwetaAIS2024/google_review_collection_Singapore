Mushroom Minced Pork Noodle was one of my favorite noodle. But not many can cooked a well balance taste with good noodle texture. This stall seem have it all.

First, this hawker centre was new to me. No idea what to eat so keep browsing around, finally realized many customers having a  yellow bowl on their table.

Especially many of customers are elderly, they must be either authentic with good flavors or very cheap. Yes. I'm both strike the right answers.

Their noodles was very well cooked with slight tenderness yet very flavourful. Simple ingredients like mushrooms, minced pork, meat or fish balls, thin slide lean pork etc.

No wonder so many elderly loved their noodles, good flavours and affordable prices at $4 and $5. And they serve Lor-Mee and Laksa too.

Overall, this noodle stall is definitely worthy to try. I do highly recommend to all especially new comer.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111255682252678932891/reviews
Kwong Fei Yee,5,"Had the minced meat noodle with mushroom. Added extra minced meat and mushroom. Asked for extra pork lard and the stall gladly provided :).

The noodles was cooked just nice and the sauce nice. The sauce can be kicked up one notch with extra flavoring. The soup was flavorful. It should be more of a 4.5 star because the sauce could be better.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118030178376808365901/reviews
Keify Toh,4,"A very good bowl of traditional minced meat mushroom noodle. Âè§Êó©Âë≥Êª°Êª°„ÄÇ„ÄÇ

Only that the meat ball is not bouncy otherwise it would have been perfect.

At $4, its value for money! If uncle add some lettuce, it will looks good",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107787013562023002862/reviews

Yit Thong Mushroom Minced Meat Noodles
üìç  628 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4, Singapore 560628

üçú Food wise: Average Ba Chor Mee, the taste was quite okay, ordered the three flavours as usual. The vinegar seemed to stand out, Ketchup was well covered by the vinegar and the chili, slight hint of spice.

The best part of this bowl was the meatball, the soft type rather than tough, and pretty flavourful. The other ingredients were alright.

‚ú® Ambience wise: Hawker centre!

ü§µüèª Service wise: Was alright!

üíµ Price wise: $4!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100695078669204769827/reviews
