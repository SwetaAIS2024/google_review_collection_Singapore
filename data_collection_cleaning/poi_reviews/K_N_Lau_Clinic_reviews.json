      "text": "After surgery, surgeon advised to change dressing during 1 week on my helper's wound. She went to this clinic: Doctor Lau asked her to come every day during 2 weeks, criticized the way the surgery has been done, wanted to redo the work at his clinic. About cleaning and desinfecting, he refused to prescribe the products to my helper, saying that he wont share the details of what he is doing as it is his business. On the other way, he prescribed tons of antibiotics.\nThis doctor is not honest at all and abuses of people weakness.\nI dont recommend !",

Dr Lau and nurse  offered to help me change my wound dressing daily for free and to check for any signs of infection in my wound.\n\nDr Lau and nurse are both warm, caring, and genuine people. While their clinic may not have the most modern appearance, they certainly do not lack expertise or quality service.\n\nHi Dr Lau and mdm, if you are both reading this: thanks for the chats and remember to take breaks and rest both!",

If someone lashes out at this clinic one day I’m not surprised. Was only here because we were in the area. Should’ve just gone to the regular clinic the next day.",

But then she went here and they gave her medication and her skin disease got a lot better. I also have a skin disease so she told me to come here. I also went to many places but my skin condition still worsened. But then I went here a few days ago and it really surprised me. When I went to other places, they only told me the medications to take but here, the doctor told me very specifically some causes of my skin disease and how to prevent it. When I went to other places, they never told me what kind of skin disease but just eczema. But the doctor here told me it was fungus eczema and he also asked some questions (eg. How often I change my bed sheets, whether or not I use rackets) then he told me what I should do so that my skin condition doesn't get worse. I thought I was going for lessons hahah",
