      "text": "I visited the Forest Walk at Mount Faber yesterday, but unfortunately, it was closed for maintenance due to a slope failure that occurred in February 2023. The closure is expected to last until July 2026 as repairs are being made to ensure safety and stability. While I was disappointed not to experience the elevated walkway and its promised views, I appreciate the importance of maintaining these natural spaces.\n\nDespite the closure, the surrounding area offers beautiful alternative paths along Telok Blangah Heights, which still provide opportunities for exploration and enjoying nature. The lush greenery and fresh air are refreshing, making it a worthwhile visit even without access to the Forest Walk.\n\nI look forward to returning once the repairs are complete to fully enjoy this scenic trail. For now, check for updates before your visit, and consider exploring other parts of the Southern Ridges in the meantime!",
