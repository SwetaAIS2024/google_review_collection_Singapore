Al Marzan,5,"I am extremely grateful to physiotherapist Ashika Shahnaz for her excellent care. She carefully treated me for my plantar fasciitis, and after just six therapy sessions, I noticed significant improvement‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt expect so quickly. With two additional sessions, my pain is now almost gone, which I hadn‚Äôt anticipated happening before flying back to my country.

I must mention that Ashika is very sweet and friendly. I really enjoyed our chitchat during the therapy, which helped me feel more comfortable and open with her.

Additionally, all the staff members are professional, polite, and well-mannered. I am very happy with their service and highly recommend them. Thank you so much!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107612880403157658652/reviews
