Tan Anthony,5,"Excellent food and brilliant customer service. Delighted with the offer of free rice and side vegetables top up. What a nice touch.

Of course the price is on the higher side, but there’s Safra discount here. Paid $15 for my chicken briyani set meal and teh tarik. Only gripe is the tandoori chicken portion could have been better, but otherwise everything was really tasty and wait staff were extremely proactive.

Thank you, will be back to try other dishes in future.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118139412012847765007/reviews

Isaac Sam,5,"This Indian restaurant serves some of the best nasi briyani and mutton curry I’ve ever had! The rice is perfectly spiced, and the mutton is tender and full of flavour. The fish head curry was also surprisingly good! The portions are generous, except the tandoori chicken and the service is friendly. Highly recommended for authentic Indian flavors!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108426703400532001032/reviews
Linda Hassan,1,"I am a regular customer, and I placed an order yesterday that included Chicken Chettina. However, when I received my food, it was a different gravy, and I immediately realized that the correct item was not provided. I was not informed that Chicken Chettina was unavailable, and instead, I was given black pepper chicken without any prior notice.

This lack of communication is both dishonest and misleading, especially for a regular customer like myself. I am very disappointed by this experience and hope that you will take this feedback seriously to avoid such issues in the future.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105854502645727875798/reviews
