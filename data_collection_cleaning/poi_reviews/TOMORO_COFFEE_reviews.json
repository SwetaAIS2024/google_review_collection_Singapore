      "text": "Very inconsistent standard. I order 2 cups one for in morning and another in the afternoon, both with less ice. The hojicha latte has significantly much lesser volume compared to the coffee. When questioned, the staff just snapped back, ‚Äúit is less ice‚Äù. Despite asking for less ice, the amount of ice is still almost a full cup (refer to the blue arrow). And the ice in my coffee was lesser with way more drink, versus the hojicha latte with super alot of ice and way lesser drink.\n\nI finished the hojicha very quickly as it is mostly ice, and found it super expensive for this amount of actual drink. Not worth it at all.",

I m in my 3rd trimester of pregnancy and going to deliver at nuh very soon. I do not wish the food there to be u hygienic. Can see from the display there‚Äôs a lot of wrap prep ahead of time and I wonder how long does the wrap are on shelves. Please keep your food fresh as possible because most likely people having your food there are sick people or pregnant women like me. üôè",
