Unexpected but got 2 pieces of cookies to go with the drinks, love the buttery cookies that reminded me of Jennyâ€™s cookies from HK for some reason.\n\nI was running late to pick up the order and they helped me to store in the fridge too ðŸ«¶\n\nDefinitely a hidden gem! Will come back for more!",

Ordered an iced latte that tasted really good, besting what you might often find from so-called 'specialty' cafes that charge higher. Definitely won me over and will be sure to drop by again next time I'm in the neighborhood.\nTL;DR If you're a coffee connoisseur, try their coffee. You won't regret it.",
