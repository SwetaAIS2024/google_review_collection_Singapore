Given the many MRT lines that runs through here, you also get a wide range of people passing through, which sometimes can add to the confusion, especially on weekends.\n\nThat all said, it's clean, systematic, and connects to Plaza Singapura and the nearby malls. There are a lot of good options for a lot of things: shopping, dining, entertainment, etc.",
