      "text": "Unexpectedly pretty decent Western food place located pretty out of the way (in a tiny hawker center under a parking lot). Seems to be very well patronized by the locals, always spot long line in front of the stall (especially in weekends).\n\nThe portion tends to be on the large side for the price, with two choices of side dishes (staples or veggies). The breaded fish fillet was consistently good and fresh, with no fishy smell and very nice batter. So did the chicken and pork chops. I usually order mashed potato as staples and it doesn't disappoint so far - well-buttered and -seasoned.\n\nOn the other hand, the steak is a bit hit-and-miss. My preferred choice is medium rare, but sometimes it's somewhat overcooked to between medium and well-done. There's one occasion where the steak wasn't evenly cooked - some parts of the meat did get medium rare, but some was rubbery. So does with the veggies, particularly the carrot, once I got unlucky enough to have hard carrot.\n\nUpdate: Tried their beef burger, which is tasty and succulent. The downside is that the bread at the bottom was too thin and got really soggy by the sauce and mayonnaise, making it hard to use without having the sauce all over my hands.",

It‚Äôs definitely unexpected for this little spot in Jurong.\n\nLove it and highly recommend! Maybe if more people come the cashier will hate his life less.",

      "text": "Áå™ËÇâÊ±âÂ†°ÂåÖüçîA pork burger comes with two free side dishes. The highlight of this course of meal is none other than the pork burger itself. The burger patty is not only thick, cooked through and succulent, but there is also a gem hidden within the pork patty itself which is delectable to go with the mouth-watering aroma filled pork patty. Although without a hint of something hidden within the pork patty, you will see and taste it when you reach the middle of the pork patty. You may find it surprisingly good if you like something like custard or egg yolk. In terms of size, the pork patty could be around 10 cm in diameter with two pieces of burger buns slightly larger nicely match with the pork patty at the top and bottom. Besides, there is also a well-cooked egg with its fresh egg yolk still lies right in the middle of the egg, placed on top of the pork patty. What‚Äôs more, both the pork burger and the egg are tasty but not salty. Then, coleslaw is also given generously, probably chilled before served and nice to have. The French fry is crispy. Some sauces such as ketchup, mustard, and Tabasco are also available to grab. Overall, it was a real satisfying meal.",

It‚Äôs was a good cut of meat, cooked to the degree I wanted‚Ä¶ yumz!! Black pepper sauce was pretty good. It‚Äôs comes with 2 side dishes. Overall value for money, $11 per plate and I enjoyed the steak. Easily accessible by private transport and the multi storey carpark is just beside the coffeeshop so no worries about getting caught in the rain.",
