Aryanee Nair,5,"This florist is a true GEM. I came in last minute wanting to get a bouquet for my aunt’s birthday that’s today and she gave me the liberty to choose the flowers and the colour scheme I want which is really nice and even added more leaves and just made the flower arrangement incredible. She’s been working at e flora for about 45 years and is truly the sweetest lady ever :)
Getting a bouquet like this online or even in stores are usually $100+ on average, sometimes even more but I got this for $60 and considering the fact that she made this arrangement on the spot - $60 really is an amazing price.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101099937424222601879/reviews
