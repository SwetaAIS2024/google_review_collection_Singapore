Christine Rose,5,"Thank you to all at Ola Beach Club for a wonderful day. Warm friendly welcome from people at watersports area and especially Rachel. S$35 for a 1 hour SUP session, good quality boards (NSP). Lovely area to enjoy the calm waters with buoys to show safe areas, even though large ships are in the bay. Secure lockers for valuables and nice shower block. My husband treated himself to a t shirt to remember our lovely day. Will definitely come back when we next in Singapore.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108863923995942459027/reviews
Pxtongmxniss,5,"We decided to host the surprise birthday bash for one of our friends @ Ola Beach. I was assisted by the service crew staff, IwanD. He gave us a very great vibe & Rachel assisted us w/ the balloons. Of course, we didn‚Äôt took their package plans so we seek permission to just do a simple deco around our ‚ÄúDAYBED‚Äù. I advised the small plans we have for our friend & they hear us & helped us throughout.

Frankly speaking, i am not a fan of beach clubs/party but coming to Ola Beach & being surrounded by friendly staffs just made our celebration better! Birthday girl loves it & thanks to Ola Beach Club & staffs. You guys are the best! üòò",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107468941035990127685/reviews
J,5,"We had a great time at the Ola Beach Club! They have amazing great facility with different kinds of beach chairs (lounge chairs, lounge sofas and cabanas) at no additional cost. The staff is very attentive and helpful, they were very proactive to my toddler needs, offering him a beach set to play while we were there.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102367658069355227842/reviews
Eleni Tzampatzopoulou,5,A lovely beach and beach bar with nice food and drinks. We pre-booked tickets for the paddle board activity and there was no wait. The staff was very friendly and helpful in explaining everything and we loved paddle boarding in the warm waters of the very safe beach. There were lockers and showers.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103076366154732309471/reviews
Nicole Marie,5,"Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon in early October. Beautiful weather  and not busy. There was no ‚Äúminimum spend‚Äù today, so we were able to use whichever beach chair, umbrella, table etc we wanted and the pool.
Food and drinks are a bit $$ but not much more than you‚Äôd expect from a resort island beach club. (Cheese sticks = SHD 17.99, Singapore drink = SGD 29.99)
We ordered and paid using a QR code at the table and food/drinks were brought out insanely fast. Great service.

On a Sunday afternoon there were a lot of families with kids. We felt very welcome in this space.

We were able to use the pool, order food and drinks, and use the showers and changing rooms. We brought our own towels.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112773855529090548612/reviews
