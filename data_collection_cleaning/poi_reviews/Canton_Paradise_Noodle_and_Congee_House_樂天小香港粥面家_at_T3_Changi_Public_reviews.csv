Toby Lim,4,"The fried bean curd skin with fish paste is nice, eat it while it’s still warm. Vege dish is normal. The shrimp wanton noodle is tasty and the shrimps wrapped in the wanton is big and juicy. May be back to try they congee they look good too.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114492375814000896043/reviews
Isa Charm,5,"The whole crew is very attentive and agile towards customers’ needs. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 The staff understands that customers prefer to dine in peace enjoying good foods and having their luggages in sight. Thumbs up for the whole team, particularly for Vincent ! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

Room for improvement is to increase the air con temperature, and perhaps to include netting to cover luggages just like at hotels to protect customers’ luggages from bring stolen by the public when we parked at the restaurant’s entrance.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111097196612882793080/reviews
Shawn Lim,4,"Great place to dine in if you like authentic cantonese styled noodles. Please park at carpark B, it would be closer to the store.

Generally crowded on a weekend evening. Wait time could be 45 mins to an hour. Food was fantastic but staff did not pay attention upon requesting for no spring onions in the dishes.

Easily overlooked on such a minor issue. Would come back again for the fantastic service and food.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105246634563644001115/reviews
Justin Wong,5,"Dainty little restaurant located at quite a obscure corner of Changi T3
Right next to the B2 carpark, but quite a walking distance if accessing from Departure or Arrival Hall

One can order porridge, homgkong style noodles ( soup/dry ) or rice dishes
Top up with $3.90 for upgrade to a set meal
One can  select 1 out of 2 beancurd or black fungus side dish, with a drink of choice

Dine-in Dishes tried :
Steam pork patty with salted fish on rice, which also comes with half an egg with lava yolk and 2 pieces of steamed kailan
- meat is slightly salty as it had soaked up quite a bit of the soya sauce
- however it is still a comforting meal

Cold beancurd with century egg
- value for money dish which cost almost double at japanese sushi restaurant

Steamed lettuce with oyster sauce
- crispy and not overcooked

Takeaway dishes tried :
Dishes were packed in a heat-seal takeway pack that looked like it is used to carry snowskin mooncake... 👌

Stewed beef brisket noodles ( soup )
- separated noodles and beef from soup in a 2-in-1 container
- able to retain its heat even after 1.5hrs drive home

Black fungus
- black fungus in appetising vinaigrette

Service staff was also polite and attentive
Will return if ever going to Changi T3 again",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104174848196325714178/reviews
Sharon K,1,"Overall one star.

Food - Noodles has the alkaline taste. Soup was tasteless. Char Siew (roast meat) was hard. Wanton was acceptable. Only the side dish fried beancurd filled with fish paste was tasty and not overly greasy.

Service - lots of area to improve on efficiency. We came during dinner crowd, didn’t feel the sense of urgency from the serving crew to handle the crowd. Kitchen staff were very active and very busy preparing food for the busy crowd.

Not worth the 15 mins waiting time in line.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104545390302571211289/reviews
