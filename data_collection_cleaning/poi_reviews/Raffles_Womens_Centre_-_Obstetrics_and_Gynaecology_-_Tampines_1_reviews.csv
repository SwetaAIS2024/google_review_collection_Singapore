Rushh H,5,"Went to see the gynae for a 630pm appointment. Surprisingly, went to see the doctor within 5-10 minutes. Probably helped by the less crowded weekdays. Doctor consultation was detailed but necessary. Everything went smooth. Alhamdulillah.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104696927392589495805/reviews
Eve Chan,1,"Same experience as another reviewer. I made appointments . I arrived on time .. But they tell me need to wait because patients that are 2 hours before me, still haven’t see yet ?! I think if they take in urgent walk in case then, at least have the courtesy to call me and advise me to come in later or if I still want to go ahead with my appointment …",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107930954281423209686/reviews
Hadie,1,"Unfortunately, the counter staff was not helpful in helping me get my medicine. The staff at loyang point clinic told me since they are now a swabbing centre, that they do not administer my pills anymore or in the future. She simply asked me to go to another clinic and did not bother telling me where I should go.  When I called Tampines Womens Centre to ask whether they have my medicine, the staff said that I am a patient, not a worker, so I am not allowed to ask directly for stock. As a patient and customer of Raffles Medical, this debacle seems so tedious and a waste of my time. The way she said was quite rude but how else am I suppose to ask? If I come to your clinic and you do not have the medicine, I have to make another trip to another clinic to find it. I hope the service can be improved. All I need is my medicine and I have to go through unnecessary stuff.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104660401246637933900/reviews
