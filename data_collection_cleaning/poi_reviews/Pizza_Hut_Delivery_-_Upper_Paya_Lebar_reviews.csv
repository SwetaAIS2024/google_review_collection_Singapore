Sher Ivan Barilea,1,Safety hazard experience üò≠ Found hard plastic pieces in the pizza!! Ordered online and had a shock when I bit through something hard while eating the pizza. Found some hard plastic within the pizza itself. What if my kid was the one eating the pizza and swallowed it? Very dangerous. I expected better quality and standard from an established restaurant. Disappointing.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112828306909561389878/reviews

William Lu,5,"It wasn't really delivery only. There is take-away option available here as well. I ordered on $3 take-away pizza - chicky ham and corn. It was on 50% disc for take-away. Good price and it was still hot and yummy.

Took about 15 minutes to get the order ready. There is one seat inside for two pax.

Preferably order through the app prior for take-away. Mostly about 15-20 minutes to get the order ready to collect.

Few delivery platform drivers collecting their order here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
