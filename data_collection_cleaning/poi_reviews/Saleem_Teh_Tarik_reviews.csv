George W (Oreo the Cat),5,"A good cup of tea or coffee is so important when choosing a place for lunch. I would avoid a place if there’s no good coffee or tea even when it has good food. I don’t know of any good coffee stall at Sims Vista as I’m not familiar with this place.

So when I decided to order my drink from this stall, I asked the owner — “Is your kopi good?”.

He was taken aback by my question. “How can ask me like this,” he replied. “How can survive here if not good?” “You must try. If no good, don’t come back.”

I’m not sure if he was offended by my question. Anyway, 5 stars to Saleem Teh Tarik for charging his hot drinks at YESTERDAY’S PRICES. My friend’s kopi O was just 90 cents and my Teh C kosong was merely $1. And the quality was pretty good, better than many coffee shops charging $1.50 or more for a mediocre cup of hot coffee or tea.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113159097227833060752/reviews
