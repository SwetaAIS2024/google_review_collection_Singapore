Lena Nguyen,5,"Dr Ong is the best pediatrician out there, i have been to quite a number of PDs. Both of my kids are under his care. He is detailed in his diagnosis, patient and kind.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104894899671785353981/reviews
Rachel,5,"Dr Ong is a very patient and caring doctor. He sincerely likes children and you can see his kindness when he interacts with them.

There are some nasty reviews about him seeing kids near the carpark entrance which are unreasonable. This practice is basically segregation of those w flu-like symptoms vs those who are healthy and there for vax or check ups. Reasonable and practical. My kid, while not down w Covid, saw the doctor at e carpark. I can understand why and am fine w that. This would give parents with young babies there for vax a peace of mind. I’ve ever been to a paed where the doctor only sees sick children after 12pm; again practice of segregation but in a poorer form. That, I thought was unreasonable as kids who are sick can’t wait that long to be treated. You have kids too. Think about it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102825218038066170558/reviews
M,1,"Visit was rushed and doctor is not thorough in his checks, had to point out to him to check the basic areas such as the ear and belly button.

He did not provide much reassurance when talking about treatment plan (recommended antibiotic eye drops and said it may or may not help?/ steroid cream for a 3 month old baby).

Would not recommend to visit as there are other better and more patient doctors within the vicinity.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117606066177811926200/reviews
Chooi Fun,5,"We have been seeing Dr. Ong for 7 years. After trying a few PDs with my first child, we stuck with him when my girl 1 year old until my second and third were born. He’s wonderful, and my children love talking to him. The nurse is lovely, and even during the pandemic, when my child had COVID or flu-like symptoms, Dr. Ong was willing to see us in the car park. I really appreciate his hands-on approach, and he doesn’t mind walking in and out of the clinic to help.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105172125463948910942/reviews
Xishan Zhuang,5,"Dr. Ong has been our trusted pediatrician, and we are always impressed with his ability to quickly diagnose and treat our children’s illnesses. His experience with children’s symptoms gives us great confidence, and our kids recover swiftly after each visit. Although the cost may be higher, the peace of mind we get from his attentive and expert care is invaluable. Highly recommend Dr. Ong for any parent seeking a caring and reliable doctor.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117810188430917002963/reviews
