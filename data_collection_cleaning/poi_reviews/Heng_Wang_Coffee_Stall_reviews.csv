Paul Toh,5,"This is definitely One of the best coffee in Singapore!
The coffee uncles changes coffee bags often so that only fresh coffee is served. I’ve been here for a few times now and it’s always fresh, never sour or stale.
Uncle still sells coffee-o at $1 per cup. Used to be even cheaper but at $1 cannot complain, especially for this quality.
Be warned - there’s always a long queue here.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110584107240453374/reviews
