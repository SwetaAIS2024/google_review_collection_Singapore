Mr W,1,"Wouldn’t  bother if you see other customers there unless you really want to wait. Close to 15 mins for a “hot” latte that wasn’t even warm. In the mean time , the wife had ordered, received and almost finished a meal (with hot drink ) over at McDs next door. Sometimes you really want to support local businesses but often service not at par with the big chains .. kudos to the aunties who work at McDs Elias mall to show how good service is done 👍",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103638814432595238060/reviews

lynn,5,"This might be the best pistachio ice cream I’ve had in Singapore?? 😍😍😍 you can really taste the pistachio, and I loved that there were tiny bits of pistachio that gave it additional texture and flavour 💯

It also wasn’t too sweet and wasn’t too milky, which allowed the pistachio flavour to take centre stage in this scoop of ice cream!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113035353984436054163/reviews
George Mui,3,"Me and my partner saw the positive reviews of this place and decided to try it on two separate occasions as we live in the vicinity. During our first visit, we bought a double scoop ice cream cone, with dark chocolate and speculous flavours. I felt their dark chocolate flavour was rich and enjoyable and its texture was alright. However, we couldn't say the same for the speculoos that had a rough texture and seemed to be breaking apart in clumps.

On our second visit, we tried the molten lava cake set with chrysanthemum flavoured ice cream. My wife found this flavour too sweet to her liking and we weren't too impressed with the pre-made molten lava cake. It was decent but we wouldn't rave over it.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101440658094773891245/reviews
Elsa Lee,5,"A gem in the neighbourhood! Exceeded expectation and never expect this quality of ice cream in the neighbourhood area. Freshly made cone pair with the ice cream, it’s just the best combi! I love their Mao Shan Wang, Dark Chocolate and Pistachio. It’s DA BOMB! Must try if you are nearby!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116766732968190984461/reviews
