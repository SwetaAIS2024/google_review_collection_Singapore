Brian Sanchez,5,We had a great time the hotel check in was so easy. I asked to break down change so I can go do laundry and they were so helpful. The room was clean. There is plenty of food to eat we had Indian food every day is a 1-2 min walk which is open 24/7. The train is about 10-15 min walk but that train will take you straight to the airport. Same train will take you to many attractions since there may not be any popular attractions near the hotel most of them you would need to take a train to get there. The train you can use your Credit Card and it works so you buy a ticket every time.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113495644712486979791/reviews
Jay Lee,5,"Have stayed in almost every 81 outlet, they have all been decent in pricing while providing more than adequate comfort. During my recent stay, I was attended to by Ms.Shirley, a warm and kind lady who made my day with her pleasant service. Thumbs up to her and 81 üëç",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114520250625775672952/reviews
Mee,3,"The hotel offers a reasonable budget option in Singapore. It‚Äôs suitable if you‚Äôre mainly looking for a place to sleep. The rooms are quite old but spacious, although cleanliness could be improved. If you prefer a more modern and cleaner room, Hotel 81 Gold, located just opposite, might be a better choice. The location is convenient, with a nearby bus stop providing easy access to the city center.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104639076882066181227/reviews
sunset tourist,1,"It was the worst hotel ever. At the front desk, they couldn't find my reservation details or booking number although I showed my booking screen and booking number, so I was forced to pay again at the front. They assured me that once my Expedia reservation was found, the payment made at the hotel would be refunded. Later, they did find my reservation, but the hotel never refunded the amount I had paid at the front, resulting in a double charge. The hotel staff showed no sincerity, didn't even bother to respond, and behaved unprofessionally. This hotel is completely untrustworthy, and I strongly recommend booking another hotel instead. I will never stay here again. I would like to share my worst experience all over the world",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100115793032023917598/reviews
Loo Choon Chwi,4,"Hot water was slightly warmer (a couple of deg C) more than the cold water shower despite I turned the hot water tap to maximum, and still too cold for a shower. Got no help from duty staff to get the hot water temperature up on the night nor next morning.
Please improve the hot water system to deliver hot water.
Consider installing instant hot water heater in each room which is effective to deliver hot water.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100090593716067761469/reviews
