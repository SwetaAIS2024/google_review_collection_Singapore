      "text": "First time eating their prata after my friend raved about it. We had plain prata and the egg prata. I like the fluffiness & lightness of the prata. Itâ€™s not soggy nor oily. Pratas were still hot and I think they make them only when ordered.  What impressed me was the accompanying curry.  Itâ€™s not soggy wasnâ€™t the all-so-often watered down curry.  It wasnâ€™t tasteless nor diluted. The curry was a full-bodied mixture of herbs and spices and likely boiled and simmered in fish bones, fish meat for hours. It has the natural sweetness and packed with flavour. As how my friend describes it, he drinks the curry. After the meal, you donâ€™t get that jelak-ness of ghee.  Just some info to take note of is this coffee shop closes by 6pm.",

      "text": "Surprisingly no price tag at store, please add price tag. $2.20/plaster prata, $1.40/kosong prata which is within market price. Food quality is crispy outside and thinner, unfortunately I found a unknown hair on my plate (turnoff my appetite). fish curry donâ€™t taste like it and I think they mistakenly added meat or wrong curry. I had better prata quality at yew tee thus, this is not the best to me.",
