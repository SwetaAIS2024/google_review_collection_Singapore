Leonard Lim,5,"Soft and fluffy, slightly chewy pancake + generous filling min jiang kueh.
Peanut $1.20 generous spilling out salty sweet peanut filling. 5‚≠ê
Coconut $1.20 coconut is on the sweet side but nice and moist and retains the chewy fibre bite 5‚≠ê
Matcha red bean $1.40 good balance of the matcha bitterness and the sweet red bean but I would have preferred it more moist as the overall mouth feel was a bit dry. 4‚≠ê

Darryl C,3,"Tried the peanut pancake costing $1.20 - The pancake felt a bit too stodgy and hard, not fluffy enough. Peanut was ok, quite fine. Overall, needs improvement.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116339559063664007715/reviews
Wilson Foo,5,"Saw a lot of reviews and recommendations for their pancakes. But today I ordered something more rare in Singapore - bean curd with gula melaka (palm sugar)

I had mine as a cold dessert. The bean curd  is silky smooth with good strong taste of tofu. And I must say they added a generous amount of gula melaka, giving it an aroma of coconut and the sweetness imparted dimensions of taste to the bean curd. Give it a good stir, breaking the bean curd to smaller pieces and coating each with the gula melaka, so that the sweetness is not overpowering on some spoonful and bland taste on others.

At $2 a bowl, the portion is small making it more precious as you savour every spoonful. Sinfully sweet but delicious.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263857328212431619/reviews
