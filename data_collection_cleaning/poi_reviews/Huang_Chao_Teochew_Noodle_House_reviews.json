There was no queue when I ordered a bowl of noodles, and I ended up waiting for 20 mins because they were busy doing takeaways. They prioritise takeaways rather than a customer waiting before them.\n\nBut gotta admit that their noodles were very chewy and seasoning was on point. But it's really not worth a 20 mins wait.",
