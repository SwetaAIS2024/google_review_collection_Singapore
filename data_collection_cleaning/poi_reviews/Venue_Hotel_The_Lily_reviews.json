Soundproofing was really bad too. We were woken up by another guest checking in to a room near ours past midnight, they were shouting for whatever reason and we couldn’t go back to sleep for a while.\n\nThe location was great (walking distance if you want to roam around Joo Chiat area) and the lobby looked nice, but apart from that, everything else was disappointing. I wouldn’t come back and wouldn’t recommend anyone to stay here.",
