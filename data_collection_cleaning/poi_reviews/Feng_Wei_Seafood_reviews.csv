Yip wanyi,1,Ridiculous of a zi char stall of $7.50 consists of just 4 meat and one big bloody chicken skin. Not worth to come and never gonna patronize again!!! It's not my first time dine in at other zi char stall which is much cheaper or expensive but is to a min amount but not like this. And I worked in a fnb industry. Is pure cheating of customers food. 请自你翻新,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117934803529448517398/reviews

george ng,5,"Probably one of the best in the area. Currently having promotion of 1 fish head, 1 meat, 1 prawn, 1 veg and 1 toufu for $62. Easily feed 6. Hard to find such offers nowadays.  Perhaps bcos of the stiff competition  from 4 other tze char stalls and a food centre nearby.  Definitely value for money.

You can also get a hor fun or Sang mee for $5 with lots of ingredients.  See pics",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105767683046036944441/reviews
GH,1,"No clear system and poor communication.

Was told waiting time 10-15 mins. Tried checking in however they kept avoiding telling exact timing. After 15 mins, checked with kitchen was told at least another 15 mins. That’s a lot of time wasted when we have guests at home waiting",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101252855469598813164/reviews
