      "text": "My daughter, son and I brought my parents who are both in their nineties with walking sticks to George's for dinner on Sunday night. Business was good for a sea facing restaurant so there was a crowd. And in front of us were five groups queuing to get in. After waiting in line for about 5 mins, noticed both folks were looking for something to support themselves. I approached the cashier asking if there were a couple of chairs to let them sit while waiting. Without hesitation, she said no and all chairs are used up for dinning customers. We waited for another 20 mins before a table was allocated. During which time, a nice lady in the queue behind us told me there was a couple of chairs at the back of the restaurant. I had a peek but realised they were for the kitchen staff and as I didn't have the blessing from the cashier, I should not overstep and use them. However, I surveyed the restaurant and realised that there weee some tables where the chairs were removed to make space for pet strollers. Naturally, I questioned (in my mind) if this is a pet friendly restaurant more than a family friendly one. Then the sign at the entrance kinda confirms it.\n\nFood is ok. Service not so as the order my daughter placed didn't arrive despite reminder and only did so after we had all finished ours. Would I return? Likely not.",

Harold and Amos provided excellent service, making my visit even more enjoyable. I will definitely be returning in the future. Highly recommend especially when you're out with family during the weekends at Pasir ris Park :)))",
