Full disclaimer: I have no shares or interest in the company.\nThe chicken cutlet is big and juicy, the sides of onion rings and coleslaw are well prepared. I think they could be the only western food offering decent choices of sides within 500m of Punggol central.\nThe carbonara and salmon is generous. Salmon is thick and juicy.",

      "text": "Why all the bad reviews?? Luckily, most of them are from a year ago. I have to say, the steak I ordered was cooked perfectly medium rare, and let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîit‚Äôs RARELY done right at hawker centers. This time, the chef absolutely nailed it! I was supposed to enjoy the steak myself, but my daughter loved it so much she ended up eating most of it (and this is already after her lunch) The coleslaw was also really good‚Äîfresh and tasty. For the price and the quality, this place is a gem. You‚Äôve definitely won over TWO new customers (yes, you have to count my daughter too!). We‚Äôll be back for sure!",
