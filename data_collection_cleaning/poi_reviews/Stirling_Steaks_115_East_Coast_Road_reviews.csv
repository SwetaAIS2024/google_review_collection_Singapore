PPGIDY,5,Nice food. Steak was beefy and delicious. We had the T bone + flank combo. Comes with fries and side salad. Pretty decent for a residential area kinda set up. Restaurant is a bit old and air conditioning was smelling greasy but good enough for a nice dinner.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109593365635729944975/reviews
Zen,5,"Had the steak buffet, and really liked the sirloin steaks. Was a bit wary because some reviews here aren't great. But I thought it tasted quite nice. They weren't all medium rare (maybe 3/4s were medium and the rest medium rare), but they still tasted nice and weren't too tough.

Service from the staff was great as they were polite and enthusiastic.

If I could make a suggestion to improve: perhaps the steak orders can be served in batches instead of all at once (since I'm ordering around 10 steaks in one order).",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118349573352854659498/reviews
Faith Lim,5,"Medium rare ribeye steak seasoned well, with flavourful sauce and mash. Even the greens tasted good with slightly sweetened balsamic sauce. I noticed most customers are regulars, and I think we will become one of them too. Service was great, respectful and not overly talkative - just wanna serve a meal well I suppose!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113459882388420612271/reviews
Eve Thow,3,"The order of 2 tenderloin medium rare steaks turned out to be medium, dry and not tender at all. It's our 3rd visit but the first time trying the steak, clearly disappointing. As we used the 1 for 1 entertainer app for this meal, we both decided to keep quiet. How to reverse the done-ness? We are reasonable customers but we won't order the steak if we return.  The 3-star is awarded to the truffle fries.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103807436553859306768/reviews
