      "text": "Overall nice place to chill with an atmosphere that is pretty relaxed. There is quite a large selection of hot food options as well as drinks here. We didn't get to try as we were too full but the deserts/tarts etc seem to be pretty highly raved about.\n\nFood wise, it was pretty good. The portion size was pretty good too. Definitely enough for sharing. It is slightly pricey, we spent 72 for 2 pax for two mains and two drinks, however this can be expected as we're around the Bukit Timah area. I would suggest to park near the open air carpark near Beauty World MRT Station Exit B.",

We also had eggplant toast which delicious. They also have wide variety of pastries and tarts to choose from. Glad that they have 2 different sizes for each type of tarts for those with smaller stomach but like to try different flavors! Staff were friendly and gave good recommendation :) would definitely visit again!",

The decor is a throw  back in time. Nothing matches as such. Antique items cover the walls, plenty to see and reminisce. Tables and chairs are bare wood, glass/metal garden table with worn chairs. Church chairs. They also provide food items to match the celebration. Christmas, Lunar New Year. Their cakes are all home made and taste lovely. Definitely worth a visit to meet family and friends. Relaxing.",
