HK milk tea is pretty average and comes without sugar, so I had to add a couple of packets of white sugar to sweeten it. I liked the fast food style seating, and the overall restaurant was clean and comfortable.",

The staff took time to explain the menu since it was our first time. They also have a mini childrenâ€™s corner where you can borrow books and toys to keep the kids entertained while waiting for the food (didnâ€™t have to wait long though, service was very fast)",

But I love how they put the calories of that item which help you to decide what to get if you re calories conscious. Will wanna try their wonton soup next time as I saw the person beside me enjoying his soup deliciously!\n\nVisited here on a weekday evening for a quick dinner. Order one è‚‰å¤¾é¥ƒ and one æ¶¼çš®. Both were tasty, especially the è‚‰å¤¾é¥ƒ which had tender and juicy meat and crispy burger crust. The æ¶¼çš® was also nice and we love the sesame sauce.",
