This is the best experience that my friends and I have ever had in a restaurant. Thank you to the chefs and the waiters for cooking this food and especially Raphael who has given us the best experience eating here in this restaurant.",

Needless to say, great quality as always.\n\nAs the promotion is rather new to us, the staff patiently explains everything about the promotion, such as the $10 baked rice promotion does not stack with the ice cream promotion but will stack with the free drink promotion.\n\nNot gonna lie, this is very confusion, but kudos to the staff for putting these points across.\n\nSwenson's is one of the restaurant that make me feels that i do not pay service charge for fun - The free plain water. It is a cheap and simple complimentary that would make the whole meal much more pleasant.",

Somehow, it vanished from cart, so I added the same item again with a roast chicken. End up we received 2 of the same grilled fish. The app clearly tried to scam our money by sending out cart items without our permission. Also the roast chicken we ordered was undercooked & still smells.",

We were attended by Razib, very attentive and always welcoming. When I bring my kid, he and his great staff are quick to offer the baby chair and baby cutlery even offering the soup of the day almost immediately.  Whenever you need something, they're always around and respond like a swat team. Fine dining experience! All the staff there make us feel like we're family visiting. We feel loved!!!!\n\nAtmosphere is nice! Like a proper American diner! Lights are not to bright and you get that cozy vibes. Lovely.",
