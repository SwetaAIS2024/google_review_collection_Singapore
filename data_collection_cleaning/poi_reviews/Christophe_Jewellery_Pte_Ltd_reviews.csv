Jean Chua,5,"Itâ€™s our 10th year wedding anniversary  and we wanted something to commemorate this special milestone.
We came across good review of Christophe and decided to contact Eileen.

Eileen is very well versed in stones and jewellery. She is professional and definitely not pushy. She gave us practical advice on the design of the ring. We were so excited about the ring and definitely pleased with the outcome of our customised
10th wedding anniversary ring!

Thank you Eileen!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117086196744764381711/reviews
