Karen Gads About,4,"Checked out the newly opened @kdolsot.bbq and it‚Äôs quite an experience!

Opening specials!
Their Korean Teppan Chicken Set for just $1 (16-18 Mar) is an insane deal! And if you miss that, there‚Äôs 1-for-1 from 19-25 Mar ‚Äî super worth it too as U.P. is $5.50/set! The set also includes rice, soup & 3 kinds of banchan!

We also tried their Korean DIY Dolsot BBQ Set (from $19.80 for 2 pax), which comes with 2 kinds of meat, lamian noodles, 4 types of banchan & lettuce ‚Äî so value for money! Plus, their variety of sauces and condiments make the DIY grilling experience extra fun and tasty.

Affordable, delicious, and perfect for a casual Korean BBQ fix. üëèüèº

Woan Ying Ong,5,"affordable and delicious DIY Korean BBQ experience, this new Dolsot BBQ spot in AMK is a must-try! We ordered the 2-3 pax DIY Dolsot BBQ set ($19.80), and it was a great value for the price.

The set came with juicy chicken and pork, springy lamian, fresh lettuce wraps, and four types of flavorful banchan. Everything was fresh and paired perfectly with their tasty sauces. The DIY grilling made the experience even more fun, and it‚Äôs perfect for sharing with friends or family.
