      "text": "The Sentosa cable car is worth doing as a round trip. We just went in a circle and did not get off. The views are really good, especially of Sentosa itself. You can clearly see the roller coasters in Universal Studios.\nIts easy to walk up to the cable car from Universal or the centre of Sentosa, its basically escalators most of the way. Gives you some unique perspectives on Singapore and the bay.",

The station is built at a height, so if you have time, check out the views. You can walk up from Imbiah Lookout station but note its a steep climb but not too long.\n\nStation area was clean when we visited and was running Pikachu-themed cars. While the instructions said the car has to be shared among 8 people, every group was allowed to have their own one. Maybe because there were not that many of us.",

The gift shop here is also larger than the one over at Mount Faber Station, with more selection of souvenirs. A Starbucks outlet is part of the station and right before the station is SkyHelix Sentosa.\n\nFor those switching to the Sentosa Cable Car line, Imbiah Lookout Station is 1-2 minutes away. Exit Sentosa Station and make a right, then head downhill. Way is clearly marked.",
