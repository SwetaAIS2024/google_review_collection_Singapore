SeungJun Kim,5,"I've dined here (at innovation 4) a few times with my friends, and they've all been pretty satisfactory so far (my friends enjoyed their meals too)! I really love their salmon & avocado don - their rice has excellent mixture of flavourful wasabi & cucumber which tastes amazing to me. Their salmon sashimi also tasted fresh. I'm actually looking forward to eating here again soon",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100958975977925692266/reviews
Preethi Ramanujam,5,Beautiful Cafe with beautiful pastas and rice bowls. The mentaiko Salmon was delish and very healthy too. The mushroom pasta was super good as well. But I would have preferred to have more veggies (got avocados and veggies on the side). They seem to have really good coffee as well. Good place for a lunch in the campus at Innovation 4.0 building,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105988836980553994794/reviews
Ariel Jewel,4,"Located in Innovation 4.0, the cafe is a little off the beaten path. In other words, a little ulu.

That said! The poke bowl at $9.20 is definitely their best dish. Sashimi is generous-ish and really fresh. Cucumber and rice is also seasoned wonderfully. There’s also a hint of truffle and mentaiko on the sashimi, which blends nicely with the other flavours in the bowl.

Mushroom Curry bowl is also worth the money, and a great budget option at $5.80. Really strong curry flavour and generous servings of mushroom and an onsen egg (slightly cooked. eh.)

The General Tso bowl was just, ok. Broccoli was tough and a bit too much vinegar throughout the bowl. Carbonara was also mid, I’d prefer the tea party or even pasta express for the price.

Poke bowl  >>>

The Thai milk tea ($2.50) and matcha latte ($4 ish) are great, though the milk tea is pricey for a small tea cup.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111418563977977305187/reviews
chu xuan,4,"Affordable cafe food like poke bowls and pasta!

Their chicken carbonara is meh only. Doesn't taste fantastic. Would try their poke bowls; their mentaiko one tastes great!

They also have $5.50 strawberry cheesecake omg would try.

Some new items on their menu like chicken teriyaki pasta is not available in the kiosk ordering machine.

3.5 stars!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900991350615107188/reviews
