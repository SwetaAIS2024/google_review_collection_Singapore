Tek Xue Nee,1,"I went to the Kovan DBS branch to inquire about closing my account, and they told me that I couldn’t do it there and had to go to the Kaki Bukit branch instead. However, when I arrived at Kaki Bukit, they told me the same thing—that account closure wasn’t possible there either.

So does DBS only allow account openings but not closures? What kind of logic is that? Where exactly am I supposed to go to close my account? It honestly feels like every branch is just trying to push responsibility elsewhere.

On top of that, the service attitude was absolutely terrible. The staff showed no willingness to assist, and when I stood in front of them trying to ask questions, they completely ignored me and continued chatting among themselves. This is by far one of the worst banking experiences I’ve ever had.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114536324512229435640/reviews

Loo Qiao Yin,1,"8am come to this branch, the staff gave the ticket and ask me to come at 10.30. Now its already 12.30 and I still haven't get a chance to step inside the bank. Please be more systematic, the VTM in other branch couldn't help me to change the mobile number as well. Please do use the function of the VTM. There are place to scan the passport and fingerprint for the verification of identity.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107177784099372352387/reviews
