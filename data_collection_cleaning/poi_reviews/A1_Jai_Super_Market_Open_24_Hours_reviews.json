One is arranging the fridge, second arranging the vegetables, and the other one just walking around. They ignore me even after i tell them i will pickup my shoppee.. after sometime i asked again how long do i need to wait. They’just continue what they are doing for the next 10 mins. And there are no signs they have interest to stop for awhile: even when there is another customer wanting to buy something.",

      "text": "Insist on your receipts when buying products from here. Today when I wanted to return a banana that is assumingly not riped even after 4 days, the curly big sized Indian with thick accent tell me this is Indian banana from India. He said can eat already while the all the skin is still green! So I asked him nicely if I can change for the one that is riped, he turn nasty and asked me for receipt. I told him never give receipt whenever I buy things from here. Then he said no receipt cannot exchange and tell me to bring receipt next time. Tell me, where in Chai Chee that sells Indian banana. Since he asked for receipt, I told him you have cctv at the counter. He said wait for “Monday boss come see cctv” of course when I told him I’m a regular customer, he said how he know and said everyone also can say. When I said to him next time I will ask for receipt, he replied “you go, I no time”. Customer service of the year. Of course I throw the 4 days old unripe banana away.\n\nUpdate: Thank you for your reply. Looks like the owner has integrity and professionalism issues as well instead of addressing the situation.",

Beware\nIt was a night delivery and by the time we compared what arrived vs what was ordered, Grab showed their T&Cs on time limit (12 hrs). Throwing rule book and not solving simple issues (missing item) screams bad service. Tried calling the shop but google phone number is not in operation\nAll this hassle for groceries is not worth it. There are far more efficient models to get groceries",
