Yve,5,"Had a birthday lunch here. Service and food were excellent. They were attentive without being intrusive. Each course was tasty, and it was fun discovering modern classy interpretations of some Irish food. I'm just sorry it took me so many years to finally give this place a try. I will definitely be back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107836813499490409536/reviews
Vania H,5,"Each dish here narrates a tale of Ireland's culinary, blending tradition with a modern touch. The flavors are interesting and delicious. Service was good, would enjoyed it more if the beautiful plates and decorations were not cleared up so quick haha. Visited during the Christmas season so received a lovely surprise of small goodies.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106818022792032353598/reviews
Sarah Gail W,5,"The dining experience was very enjoyable. I thought the overall ambience and plating / presentation were 10/10. What stood out most was the hospitality. The staff noted it was my husbandâ€™s birthday and gave a little something which was thoughtful and useful - a little goodie bag comprising samplers of Irish cream, the very same bacon butter that came with the soda bread in the menu, and a useful fridge magnet with the recipe of the said bread. Such a nice way to remember the meal by!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111214692298364274085/reviews
Monna Borrini,5,"The food was really good and quite surprising. Everything was really original and tasty. Special mention for the main courses which were amazing, espacially the Mussels one. I was also quite surprised, in a good way, by the wines. The only thing I can say is that it was a little too cold in the room for me. Thank you very much for the experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116093259630635282388/reviews
