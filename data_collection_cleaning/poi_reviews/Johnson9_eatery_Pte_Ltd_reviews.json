Notice that even though they were serving coffee or drinks, is always 1 hand 1 cup.\nEven self service counter, slow slow slow, 3 to 4 fellows inside, queue long & none is bothered. Priorit should be given to those at self service counter reasons being that food that is ordered requires us to self collect example the laksa noodles fireball noodles & .....\nSeems like the management may want to carry out a spot check on the blk 332 outlet",
