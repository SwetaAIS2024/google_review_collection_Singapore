      "text": "Saw many bad comments, ordered anyway. Indeed using phone and I was ignored for about 1 minute. Lor Mee in general is quite good actually, but u can’t get the garlic, chilli, or other condiments yourself other than vinegar.\n\nWas ready to give it a better rating but comparing to the other Lor Mee or any other stalls among the sea of coffee shops nearby, this $6 lormee is really overpriced for what it offered. I was expecting way more ingredients but I can barely find any pork or fish, just 1-2 little bits of it..\n\nComparing the photos shown, I had to lower the rating further. Even the egg was half an egg instead of a full egg shown in the photos, not the right way to cut cost. Photos of Michelin star and all the ads, no where near and not the right way to do business. I seldom give such bad reviews, but just compare what I received and the signature photo shown.\n\nDon’t depend on past glory to do business.",

At least now we will have an additional option for food now that the new shop is opened. Hoping that they will maintain the standard.",
