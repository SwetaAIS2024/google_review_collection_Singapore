Sujon Sheikh Official MY,2,"In front of the main entrance gate always gossiping/gathering 6-7 Myanmar/Indonesian boys drinking Beer/alcohol. It's very harassment while couple wants to check-in hotel.
So please I request to the Hotel authority from today plz don't give permission gathering in front of the hotel.
