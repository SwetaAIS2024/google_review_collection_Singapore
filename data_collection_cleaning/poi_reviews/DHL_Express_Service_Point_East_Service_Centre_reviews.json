I have a tax payment to make and their ChatBot is simply primitive (for lack of an ugly word) and to request for online payment and contactless delivery is Magic to these cavemen.\nIt's utterly Robbery in Broad Daylight when my household were coierced to make payment or my parcel is delayed for maybe 10 years despite customers were treated as if we owe them a living and to kiss their feet when WE are the hands that feeds them.\nIf the company closes down I make sure I'm the first to post the nastiest comment!",
