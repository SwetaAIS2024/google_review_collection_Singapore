Hasrol Abu taib,5,"My car has already changed to an aftermarket air filter and exhaust system. Previously, my car felt heavy during initial acceleration and when trying to overtake other vehicles. The engine was quite loud, and there was some vibration. I went to HT ECU Tuning to get an explanation from Bro Alex and had my car tuned. Now, the engine is quieter, gear shifts are smoother, and at low speeds, the car doesn’t lose power. ""Just press the pedal, and there's power."" Thanks, Bro Alex, for tuning my car. It's so much fun to drive now... (I use a Myvi Gen 3 2020).",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110937536350572049879/reviews
