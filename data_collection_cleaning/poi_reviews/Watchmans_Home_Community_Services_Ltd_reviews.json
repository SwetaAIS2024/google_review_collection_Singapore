On the phone after the guy was rude and hung up mid-sentence. Ignored my messages after. Avoid.",

There were some challenges moving my sofa into my new home but they were very patient and took care and time to device a method and eventually safely maneuver the sofa into my new place. Thank you - you made my move an easy and stress-free one.",

The uncles were all super nice and funny (and very very strong!!!) they work so hard and were always smiling/never in a foul mood even though my furniture wasn’t the lightest nor the easiest to move. I really appreciated how easy it was to engage them, we liaised over WhatsApp.\n\nWe hired these movers for our actual move, storage, and disposal. It was hectic but we managed! Do exercise common sense - if you have particularly expensive or delicate items, consider moving these yourself or making arrangements to pack them safely in bubble wrap etc.\n\nThe movers were often early or on time which was fantastic. I recommended them to a friend who used them just today too!! If you’re on the fence, please give them a try.",
