      "text": "Second time to Prairie. First time all I remember was how bad the food was, but I wrote it off as a fluke and gave it a second chance. After dining here a second time, all I can conclude is that it is no fluke.\n\nFood is terrible. Service is equally bad. Both of the orders we received were wrong. The staff made no effort to make it right.\n\nAnd despite the orders being wrong, we ate the food anyway, and the food was so bad that neither of us finished our dish.\n\nMy omelette had some undisclosed white goop on top, and was filled with what appeared to be caramelized onions, which also were not listed on menu.\n\nMy wifeâ€™s dish was covered in smoked salmon, which she didnâ€™t order and she discarded. The rest of the dish was not appetizing.\n\nThe bright spot was the pastry, but it was on par with other good pastry shops in SG.\n\nAll in all, Iâ€™m very surprised by how bad the quality and service is given that this is a Craftsmen property. I usually enjoy dining at Craftsmen joints.",

      "text": "A good example of a place which only looks good on the photos.\n\nThe garden view and overall atmosphere are lovely, and the portion sizes are generousâ€”these are the only positives from our visit.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was quite disappointing. We ordered the Duck Leg Confit, but the duck was dry and overly salty, and the sweet potato side was surprisingly tough and difficult to chew. This dish was a big letdown.\n\nThe Omelette & Hash dish was also disappointing. While the omelette itself was fine, the potato hash was severely overcookedâ€”bitter, burnt, and extremely tough. We couldnâ€™t get past the first bite.\n\nOn a more positive note, the free salad bar was fresh and enjoyableâ€”we both liked it.\n\nService, however, left much to be desired. We were seated at a large table shared with another group, which felt awkward. There were multiple mix-upsâ€”two or three incorrect dishes were brought to our table, including one left on an empty seat without asking who it was for. When the waitress brought the Duck Confit, she placed it right at the edge of the table, which felt careless and could easily have caused the dish to fall.\n\nWe sat indoor, when I sat, I noticed there were ants on the table.\n\nOverall, Iâ€™m giving two stars only because of the generous portions and pleasant garden setting. Unfortunately, the food and service did not meet expectations. I wouldnâ€™t return and wouldnâ€™t recommend it. With this pricing, there are better options nearby.\n\nIf you read the latest reviews, you will find the similar experience as mine, including reviews and complaints about the food and services.",

We saw tables asking to cancel their order. The servers were very nice about it but\njust be prepared for the long wait and be nice to the servers.\n\nPrairie management should do better.",

Will definitely be back!\n\nHad the Eggs and Hash in 2 versions - bacon cheese and mushrooms. Both very yummy. Drinks especially matcha latte with sesame was good.\n\nStaff on duty gave good recommendations. They were also accommodative to my family of 4 (including 2 children).\n\nPleasant attentive service with superb food and drinks. Will definitely be back.",
