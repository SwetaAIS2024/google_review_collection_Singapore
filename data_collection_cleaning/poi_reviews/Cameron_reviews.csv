Roger Bingham,5,"I stayed here for several weeks 50 (yes 50) years ago with owner ""Ongi"" and son, Cameron.
Great location (at that time) mostly residential and no commerce.
Great food. Lovely family.

Yes, it has changed but I still have fond memories.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111845006189776690379/reviews

Constance Bowes,4,"The hotel is run by a family and it is like being in their home. Go for a more expensive room if you can. The neighborhood is exclusive, million dollars homes, close to hospital if you needed to visit 14 minutes away walking. There is a mall for shopping even closer. Easy access to transit. And very close to connecting park pathways. It is in need of updates but there is a staff person watching the desk 24 hours. Single lady traveling alone I had no worries. Cash only as they don't have a card machine. Also have WiFi. Best location in city",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106070429792241693675/reviews
