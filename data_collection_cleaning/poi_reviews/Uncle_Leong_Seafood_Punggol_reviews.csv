Tan SR,4,"Great service. I ordered a hot chrysanthemum tea which the waitress prompted immediately after I have had my last sip.

Pay by cash, 5% discount. Prawn cracker and wet tissues are chargeable.

Crab was 1.3kg 160$+. Total damage was ~400$. Didnâ€™t really like the prawn roll.. but thatâ€™s my personal opinion.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103895936704968230009/reviews
Shane Lim,1,"My friends took me here for my birthday lunch yesterday, chill crab failed terribly, only tasted chilli oil. Too much starch also. First and last time here, what a big disappointment for all of us especially itâ€™s my birthday lunch.

Edit: Manager contacted me to investigate the matter and I appreciate this prompt response, thank you.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117107996320796459819/reviews
Sara Joy Yao,4,"The food served is very down to earth and price point is great! Portion and cooking style is very old-school zhichar style.

The restaurant has both indoor air-conditioned seating as well as outdoor space that looks out to the park.

Ambiance is very chill and laid-back. Perfect for large weekend family dinner gathering.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114415884019099013941/reviews
Ju Amir,5,"We were craving crabs and have heard great things about Uncle Leong - so we decided to give it a try. Absolutely no regrets!!
The shimmering sand crab was a clear winner. It was creamy with the right hint of pepper. And that chilli crab! It had the right amount of chilli so the sauce is not too sweet. The meat on both were juicy and plump. For the price we paid, it was truly worth every cent.
Kudos to the service team. Food was quickly served. They were always at the background, changing our plates when things got too messy and were quick to assist us whenever we raised our hands.
Will definitely be back for more!!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101135721596085985310/reviews
