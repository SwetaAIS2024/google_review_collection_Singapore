MHong Cheung,2,The portion was big and generous. However I ordered Fried Maggie and it was too salty. I felt the price (w additional egg) was on the high side at $7. The prawn included was cold too. Hope they will cook the prawns longer next time.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112489288430816321322/reviews
Damon Wong,4,"After renovation, this stall was opened beside hua zai roasted meat that has opening promo. There was no promo for this stall but still decided to go for it because pad Thai craving.

And pad Thai has thumbs up recommendation on the menu. Plenty of wok hei coming from the plate. It's small for hungry labour workers but office workers may find it acceptable. Prawn is small. Quality ok but don't expect big portion.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101823665415475786879/reviews
