Peter Lim,3,"NOW, Each time I order the same mini salad, I need to separate the meat onto the cover to see if the correct portion (by weight, they said) is added because I once noticed the meat was so little that I didnâ€™t take a photo to prove my case and the next visit onwards I will check first before eating.  Today, I reported to a service staff, showing the amount of meat therein and THEN he took out back to kitchen and returned with a box with double the portion earlier.   I now have 2 photos to show the before and after-complaint.
Other than the above, the food is good - delicious and fresh; and itâ€™s for this reason that my family eats here regularly, like 3 days a week. The serving staff were polite and friendly too.
(Notr: I was offered a free drink or small fries if i write a review; but when i told them it will not be a 5 star review, he said then I canâ€™t have the free stuff, unless i give them a 5star review ðŸ˜¬",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111743235010518230848/reviews
BeholdHim,3,"I have patronised this outlet several times but today was a disappointment with lack lustre experience.

1. I stood at the ordering counter for over 30 seconds with a few staff busy working roundabout the counter but didnâ€™t pay attention to me. I waited until a lady staff instructed a seemingly new trainee to take my order.

2. I ordered 3 bowls of burrito bowl and wanted to add on beef. I needed clarification between the ground beef and steak beef. I used to have shredded chunks of beef and realised that it had been replaced with minced beef. I ended up ordering 1 Ground and 2 steak. When served, was disappointed that the ground beef version was not as delectable as the shredded beef version that my family liked. I believe the cost of goods must have been a critical factor for the change to minced beef.

3. What made it worst was the 2 servings of limp and soft fries. This was the first time I was served such unappealing fries at GG. I think they served the pre fried fries instead of going for a 2nd round of deep frying for the crunch. It was sub standard and a big disappointment. I hope it was only so fortoday. However, since it doesnâ€™t serve the shredded beef anymore, nothing entices me to patronise again.

4. Self service cutlery had the wooden forks and spoons mixed together. Disorganised. I had to pick several times to check if it was a fork or a spoon.

5. For dining in, we had no choice but to use the disposable containers for our condiments including onions and cilantro. Such a waste of disposables.

6. I hope the Australian Franchisor is aware of the situation and rectify the situations.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107790882829972143902/reviews
wynne daria,5,"I had a great experience at Guzman Y Gomez! The food was fresh, flavourful, and served quickly. I especially enjoyed the burritoâ€”it was packed with generous fillings and just the right amount of spice. The staff were friendly and efficient, and the overall atmosphere was vibrant and welcoming. Itâ€™s definitely a spot Iâ€™d come back to for a satisfying and fuss-free Mexican meal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116668815255996310089/reviews
Regine Ho,5,"Great fast service! Came after lunch peak hour so it's not so crowded. Always love a hearty grilled steak burrito bowl from GYG. It's a little bit stuffy because the kitchen is indoor too, but all's good.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109671976232639535525/reviews
Jeremy Huang,5,"Healthy, fast, convenientâ€¦ One of the best fast food restaurants! I love coming here for dinner. Their soft tacos are excellent! The fries are hot and fresh and use real potatoes. The price is affordable and staff will serve food to your table instead of collecting yourself.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105812504779991174441/reviews
