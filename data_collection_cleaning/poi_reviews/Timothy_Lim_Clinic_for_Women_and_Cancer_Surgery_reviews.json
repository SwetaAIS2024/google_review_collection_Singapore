Would clearly discuss and explain management plans with us and also had pleasant experience with him delivering our 2 babies. He’s very experienced and does make plans in the best interest of his patients. Would recommend him especially for his gynaecological services.",

He removed a huge blood cyst from my right ovary via open surgery when keyhole was aborted due to bad adhesion. Post surgery recovery was good and the external scar was hardly visible! Definitely very neat and careful doctor.",

I later had a few follow-ups with him - throughout my experiences with him, he was always gentle, professional, patient and would speak in simple terms so that I understood him. The receptionist ladies were always professional, polite and properly organized. Clinic was always clean, making me feel very comfortable as well. Thank you so much!",

I have been seeing Dr Timothy for 4+ years,\nI find him to be a very ethical doctor, which is quite rare attribute nowadays.   He is a down to earth doctor that puts his patients interests first instead of profit.\nLast year my third surgery was done by him, I am very impressed by his skill.  I had a very ugly and thick scar from the previous surgery by another Dr,  Dr Timothy fixed the scar after the surgery and the scar is neat and thin now! Recovery was fast under his tender care.\nHe is one of best dr that I have come across,  I would strongly recommend him.",
