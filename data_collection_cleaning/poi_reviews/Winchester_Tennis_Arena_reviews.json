And there are not many sheltered court in Singapore especially in the west side. Good thing is that you can easily book the court via their online booking system. The court might be abit hard to find you are going there for the first time since it is located inside the Alexandra Park Estate.",

Tip: book court 1 if possible since this court is separated from the rest so you dont have to worry about mixing up your tennis balls with others",

Good courts that are sheltered completely and comes with showering facilities as well. Will frequent this place and the coaches here are really friendly! Strongly recommend Coach Rocky! :)",
