IMPRESSED.\n\nCheck in was quick and payment collected prior to rendering of injection. I only waited for a minute or so after payment before I was called in to the doc‚Äôs office.\n\nDr Huang was so nice and answered my queries patiently + expertly administered the jab cause I did not even feel the needle go in nor when the vaccine was injected. üòØ\n\nWas in and out within 10-ish minutes and still reeling from how efficient the whole process was!",

      "text": "This clinic is packed and clearly the staff is overwhelmed and can't handle the volume of people. Waited almost 2 hours to do a simple blood test, measurements, BP, for the end to end process despite making an appointment? Then I'm not sure what the appointment booking is for.\n\nAfter you wait a long time for your urine test to be done and blood sample taken, there are basically no procedures and no guidance on whether it's straight to the next station or continue this waiting game. No one bothered to guide me.\n\nI don't understand how the clinic requires me to spend almost 2 hours here to do 3 simple things.\n\nPerhaps the clinic should review their own workflow and improve accordingly. This is madness.",

But their email service really takes more than a week to respond, which defeats the purpose as nothing can be done while waiting for 2 weeks or so for the follow-up. Not sure why it takes them so long to respond to emails, I think even the government bodies like ICA replies faster. It'd be good if they could reply to inquiries faster",

      "text": "My first visit this morning at Minmed Clinic @Paragon for mammogram, clinic was packed & busy but I was warmly served by DANA at the reception, she has a sweet smile & very polite. I didn‚Äôt wait quite long & was attended by KHINE for the mammogram who‚Äôs also very sweet, polite, friendly & super gentle, no pain or discomfort at all for this mammogram! Lastly I requested to retake my BP as the previous reading taken at the other Minmed Clinic was incorrect. ANDREA attended to me almost immediately, she was also very nice & patient, let me sit & rest a while before taking my BP, my new correct BP result was also updated in the app instantly at my request. I must compliment these 3 ladies for their positive & efficient service attitude, it was a contrast to my experience at Minmed Clinic @City Sq Mall.. These 3 ladies have served me well & such great politeness with greeting & welcoming smile! THANK YOU & well done ladies!!! Keep up your good work! This clinic @Paragon is also very nicely furnished with comfy couches & sofas to sit, also offers a self-service water & beverage machines & cookies.. great! üëçüèºüëçüèº",
