Charcoal roasted is always better. Roasted duck and pork skins are crispy and I love the char siew not too sweet ❤️ Stall opens every Tuesdays to Saturdays from 11 am till sold out.\n\nSecond visit to try roasted duck drumstick and roasted pork. Yummy! Pity I forgot to ask for sauce on the duck. Would have made it better.",

Tried the $8 plate that comes with all 3 combinations (duck, roasted pork and char siew). All 3 meats were perfectly roasted over charcoal and very tender. The duck's skin is slightly crispy and not too fat. Roasted pork wise, you can hear the cunchy sounds when chewing on the skin. My favourite is the char siew. Well marinated, not too sweet and with the right balance of fatty and lean meat in every slice.",

Standard is there sweet and savoury well balanced.\nChilli is nice too,match with the meat and the fragrance rice. Rice is not crumpy, well separated grain by grain.\nChar siew abit fatty. Can ask for less fatty portion next visit.",
