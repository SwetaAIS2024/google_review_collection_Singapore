Azor,5,"A restaurant like no other, mouthwatering oyako don, lip-smacking Japanese curry, and authentic Thai kapao rice. Delicious dishes served by great top tier chefs. Top tier ingredients such as corn fed and cage free chicken and A5 Miyazaki wagyu beef. Highly recommend!!!

Kimi Kwek,5,This SAC stall is fire! Always a great store and pleasure to eat from. The food includes Oyako Don and Curry Don which is mouth watering. They also serve chawanmushi which is ONLY $1. They also serve fried food on Wednesday. Always have long queues and is a fan favourite among ACSI students.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106983028607022688432/reviews
Evan Ho,5,Easily best stall in a 50km radius. Would definitely recommend driving here to eat. Just make sure you come early or the Chawamishi will be sold out.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113073862096805509506/reviews
ray chong,5,"One of the best stalls in the SAC @ ACSI. This Japanese stall serves delicious Japanese cuisine, such as oyako don, curry don, red fish with rice and much more. My favourite is the oyako don, a normal one would be $2.50 but I feel ordering the $3 one would be more worth the money. On Fried Food day, (Wednesday) There would be pineapple rice and bee hoon with fried food such as chicken, mushroom & crab stick. There is also Chawanmushi for $0.70. 👍🏻👍🏻",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107926741278506435106/reviews
Elliot Yong,5,"At first I was skeptical of the quality of this premier restaurant. I thought to myself “it cannot be! Three dollars for excellent Japanese cuisine? No way!” However, as soon as I took a bite, it was so good that the hit song ‘Dai Jou Bu’ by RADWIMPS started playing in my ears. I would definitely recommend this place. 10/10",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107874660184273980010/reviews
