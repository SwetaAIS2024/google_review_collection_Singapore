khrhms,4,"Fuss free service, just grab and go. Popular spot amongst workers in the morning for quick breakfast. Nothing spectacular, just simple food and drinks. Affordable prices. Food is HALAL certified. Drinks are made to order. Coffee is of good brew and not too sweet.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
Ember Shen,5,"$3.90 noodles and $5.40 fried rice. Noodles are better but not the rice.
The soya milk mix with grass jelly drink is $1.60, unbelievably cheap. Even laoban soya bean milk is $2 already",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117465885711011307889/reviews
LLaw Lee,1,"I recently had a truly unpleasant experience at this food stall.
I ordered three packs of fried noodles and vermicelli, without any side dishes as my wife had prepared them at home.

To my astonishment, the lady staff member responded with a rude and condescending tone, questioning my order with “Har??? Kosong ah??” (empty in Malay). Her pretentious attitude and subsequent muttering made me feel humiliated and embarrassed.

When I tried to clarify with another staff member whether ordering without side dishes was allowed, they completely ignored me, adding to the overall negative experience.

Such appalling customer service is unacceptable. I will never patronize this stall again and strongly advise others to avoid it.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105487800985813948664/reviews

安An_,1,"The portions of the food are pitifully small, and it's more expensive than other places... I don't know where I can find the confidence to sell it at such a price. The taste is mediocre, and I won't come here for a third time.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101039492601723274244/reviews
