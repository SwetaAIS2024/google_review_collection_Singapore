For our end-of-academic-year event, we reached out to Iskina Cebu, and they generously agreed to sponsor a large serving of their delicious lechon along with two trays of flavorful chopsuey.\n\nThe coordination was smooth, and their team was incredibly accommodating throughout the process. Our attendees thoroughly enjoyed the dishesâ€”the lechon and chopsuey added a wonderful touch of home to our celebration and made the event even more special.\n\nWe are sincerely grateful for their generosity and support, and we definitely look forward to visiting their restaurant to enjoy their amazing food again!",

      "text": "Great tasting lechon. I ordered the 500g for $24. Skin is very crispy, nice mild smokiness, good balance of fats and lean meat. Aromatics like spring onions, ginger, garlic and lots of lemongrass makes the meat very fragrant. It's lemongrass overload! Actually the lechon is flavourful enough that no sauce is needed for me.",

Very near to Lyf hotel and very close to One-North Station too! It is a must-try Filipino cuisine! They are located in Timbre+ where there is a live band or gig every night.
