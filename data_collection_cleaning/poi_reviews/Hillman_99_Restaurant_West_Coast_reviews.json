Medium-sized prawns ($66 for 9x), signature paper-wrapped chicken ($85 for 15x), and claypot pig liver ($42). The rest were simple classics like hor fun, sweet & sour pork, pork ribs, omelet, and beancurd. While the nostalgia was lovely and the food was good, the price tag makes us think twice about returning.",

The paper wrap chicken meat now are all breast and quite big chunks, not enough seasoning too. The dark sauce prawns used to be very tasty but not now. Omelette also Abit dry. Total disappointment",

The clay pot liver is the star of the meal - very fragrant and tasty. Paper wrap chicken too oily, but taste quite good. In general food is average.\n\nHere mainly for the nostalgic feel. Ambience is good service is good",

I relied on them for my cravings. They are famous for their claypot dishes. Claypot beef is sooooo good! Old style restaurant and love the authentic vibes! Staff are long time there, very patient and nice. Their chrysanthemum drink is addictive. Had to ask for refill all the time. Super popular space with limited seatings. Recommend to book in advance.",
