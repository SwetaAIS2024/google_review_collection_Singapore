Megan Lim,5,"The team at Siësta are so funny, cheerful and approachable. I love the food, such as the 3 cheeezy crisp and there is a matcha latte drink that is called Shrek’s love potion! The food and drinks are delicious and good quality. My favourite part is the absolutely relaxing ambience. The place has nice sofas and a warm cosy colour to it. I can totally use my laptop and relax there whilst having a slow afternoon or evening. 100% will come back again!
It is now my favourite cafe at Kampong Glam Singapore for a brunch, latte, coffee or just a chill spot. The location is convenient and quite near the popular Haji Lane.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111029822793703147953/reviews
