      "text": "This was a newly opened Kopitiam 20 - 25mins away from our house. We have always wanted to try out the Tze char (Jia Yan Seafood) here as the dishes look tasty but we were busy, and we have finally got the chance to do so today!\n\nWe ordered 3 dishes:\n1. Cai Poh Beancurd\n2. Sambal Sweet Potato Leaf\n3. Cantonese-style steamed Garoupa\n\nThe overall verdict is that itâ€™s above average. The sweet and savoury Cai Poh is well fried, and itâ€™s layered on top of the beancurd which is crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside. The amount of sauce was just alright; not too much, not too little. It tasted much better than the same dish that we usually see at ä¸‰ç›…ä¸¤ä»¶.\n\nSteamed Garoupa tasted fresh. Because the candles below are heated up, it keeps the sauce (and the fish) piping hot for a longer time, which adds to its tastiness.\n\nWe thought the sambal sweet potato leaf was quite ordinary - typical sambal fried leaf. The saving grace is that the sambal is slightly spicy, and itâ€™s not too oily.\n\nThe downside? We thought the portions were slightly on the smaller side, and itâ€™s not very cheap. Bear in mind the price shown on the receipt is not accurate - we topped up an additional $6 to switch from Steamed fish head with black bean sauce to Cantonese-style steamed Garoupa.\n\nDefinitely an above average Tze-char we would recommend. As they are still quite new, hopefully they keep up with their standards as time passes.",

When I check with them, the counter lady told me they are cooking it(maybe afraid I cancel the order?) After 30 mins of waiting & 10 mins of waiting after check with the counter lady, she comes and inform me that the marmite pork rib I ordered out of stockâ€¦ I mean they canâ€™t inform me earlier ? The food is nice but Iâ€™ve eaten better and for the service? They need to improve lmao But I guess they donâ€™t care since they think thereâ€™s still other customer than me. Also I found hair in my Hor Fun after Iâ€™ve waited for 40 mins ðŸ« ",

Thick and fragrant curry, prawn roll with fresh prawns, not frozen, fish head had some of the freshest fish ive had from SG kopitiams, pork ribs were tender and full of flavour, brocolli was cooked perfectly (which is really rare).\n\nThose that talk about serviceâ€¦ honestly its not bad at all. But dont expect hotel seafood or big restaurant service. Cmon its just a kopitiam zi char. Wan good service dont cheapskate la",
