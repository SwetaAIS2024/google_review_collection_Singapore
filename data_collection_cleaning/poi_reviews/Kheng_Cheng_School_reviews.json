      "text": "Just graduated from here [On 14 November 2024].There are many good, kind ,and friendly teachers.One is Mr Lite, Ms Chua ,Mrs Toh and Cikgu Naz. Canteen has very good people and food, especially the Auntie and Uncle at the Western Stall. Because of a certain English teacher, my English skyrocketed and gave me motivation in P3. When I got my results, my two  P1 & P2 teachers congratulated me on my Malay as I got AL 6. Being an Indian taking Malay, it was hard.With tuition and help from Cikgu Naz and my classmates,I was the first to get 41\\50 for Prelims Malay Oral . When Cikgu Naz told this to my Malay class, the reaction was a grand applause. My jaw dropped [metaphorically]. Many or even, all of my accomplishments are purely because of my teacher's support and unwavering determination [look the phrases up, you are on the internet]. Parents, if you are living in Toa Payoh or somewhere nearby, this school is most suitable for your kids' primary school journey.",

Now i m having my daughter always not happy if being sick and cant go to school and she is at primary 2. There is homeworks and she likes it. We really love the teachers here. From security to seller in the canteen are all very kind, gentle and understanding. I think this is the culture of caring has been embedded in this school.
