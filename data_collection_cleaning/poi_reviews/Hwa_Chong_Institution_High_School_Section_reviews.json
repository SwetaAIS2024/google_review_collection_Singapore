I basically completely wasted 2 years (whilst getting into trouble (= DP)). The school does place quite a bit of emphasis on academic results (like duh?) so you better do well if you don't want to be \"seconded\". You definitely do have more opportunities if you're in a Special Programme. Can't blame the school though, I simply failed to seize the opportunities offered to me. Oh and elitism DOES exist. Attaching some pictures because I have quite a few.",

It‚Äôs not true that if ur Chinese sucks u are not suitable for hci.my Chinese is trash yet I did not compared to by my classmates or teachers at all.We learning coding and stuff alr in sec 1 and we have a lesson called thinking program which teaches you the elements of thinking and stuff.we have very chill ppl here.all the stalls here have affordable and delicious food.during the open house all the ppl I talked you were patient. The school culture for hci is also very good and everyone is supportive.if you need help and u ask ur classmates and teachers they will definitely help you. My friends and I always exchange notes with each other. Facilities are amazing and the scenery is beautiful.I literally got 4M and willingly went to hci cuz I was so impressed.just saying this is a W SCHOOL.üòçüòçüòç6/5 experience I chose correct",
