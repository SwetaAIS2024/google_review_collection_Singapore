Andrew Tan,5,"Stopped by on a hot day in Singapore and got an Iced Mocha and an Iced Matcha—both were super refreshing! The service was amazing, especially from Daniella, who welcomed with a big smile and was so warm and friendly and very hospitable which makes one feel at home.

She also recommended a special dessert called Blossom Bliss, which is only available at the Supertree Observatory. It’s inspired by pulut hitam and has black glutinous rice pudding, gula melaka, chocolate mousse, and a purple sweet potato sponge. Such a unique and delicious desert that I even finished it within minutes because it was too good

Great drinks, awesome service!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117852291298225220953/reviews

The Genesis Family,5,"Janice Wong at the Supertree offers a unique dessert experience with breathtaking 360° views of Gardens by the Bay.

Indulge in beautiful and delicious creations inspired by the surrounding gardens, like the ""Cloud Forest"" mousse. Though pricey, the stunning views and exquisite desserts make it a worthwhile splurge for a special occasion.

Reservations are highly recommended, especially for sunset visits. Don't forget your camera, as every corner is Instagram-worthy!

Just be aware that access requires a separate Supertree Observatory ticket.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114071894759795666732/reviews
Carol Toh,5,"The view was stunning, and it was a great spot to relax. The dessert was delicious, and Winnie, who served me, was kind and friendly. She took the time to explain the available options, helping me make an informed choice. The dessert turned out to be excellent. Winnie was also very helpful in letting me know the location of the nearest supper spots. I had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back with my friends! :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117693358798847731657/reviews
