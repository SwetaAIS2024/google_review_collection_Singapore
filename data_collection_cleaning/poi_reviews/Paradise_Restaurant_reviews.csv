syed Ibrahim Yusoff,3,I used to visit the restaurant quite often. Lately their food quality is on the decline. Maybe the cooks had been changed. I had masala Dosa I I was quite disappointed..the dosa was not hot or crispy. The masala is ok. The coconut chutney is cold like that taken out from fidge. The bru coffee is light and the flavor is less. The drink maker also had changed too. They had to improve the quality of the food.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110405930017936179870/reviews

LP Pua,4,"I ordered the Mee Goreng with chicken meat for $7. It was a big plate, and the amount of chicken meat was probably the most I've ever encountered in a plate of Mee Goreng.
