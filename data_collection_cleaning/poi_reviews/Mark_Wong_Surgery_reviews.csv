Brendon Hawley,5,"I will start with a back ground to my life changing event in 2020. I thought I was bullet proof, in that I was fit and healthy or so I thought for a 67 year old. Two days prior to Lock Down for COVID 19 in Singapore, I was recommended to do a Colonoscopy.
From this moment our lives were suddenly turned upside down, I was initially diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer.
My Wife and myself struggled to process this, I thought this always happened to other people and not myself, and we did not know where to start, extremely emotional situation.
I was recommended to see Dr Mark Wong at Mount Elizabeth (Novena), and from that moment on having met Mark and his team, we knew that I was in the best care in the world and in extremely capable hands, our concerns melted away, this part is very difficult to describe emotionally. What a fantastic experience, besides the friendly atmosphere from Mark and his Team, the Surgery and after care beyond amazing. I am now fully recovered and owe my life to Mark and his team. Never to be forgotten.
I still go back to Mark for regular check ups and it is the same feeling as going home.
Mark you are the Best",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115454737994881945442/reviews
