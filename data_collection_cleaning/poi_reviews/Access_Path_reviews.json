      "text": "The Access Path serves as a convenient access to Margaret Drive and the many amenities around it for residents of Ridout Road, especially for those without their own means of transport.\nPeople walking their dogs were seen using the Path.\nThere used to have a few blocks of HBD flats at this area that once housed victims of the Bukit Ho Swee Fire. But these blocks of flats had since been demolished and the area left vacant until now.\nMargaret Drive was named after Princess Margaret, sister of Queen Elizabeth II. The locals, colloquially called it \"Xin Lu\"  新路 (new road) as it was the newest road around the estate then.",
