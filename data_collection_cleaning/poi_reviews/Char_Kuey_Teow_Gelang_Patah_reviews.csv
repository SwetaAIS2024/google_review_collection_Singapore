Nurul Izaaz,3,"Google 'Charkweyteow Gelang Patah' for exact location. Food was good, got one special n one kerang char kuey tiao only Rm19. Free flow water, and cili. Business runs by 3 young male, 2 cooks and 1 taking orders. They'll announce your name when your order is complete, so pls pay attention. Not enough table, chairs and light to cover the whole area, but parking was easy since it is by the road. Come only when the weather is great, since there's no shade. You can bring your own table/chair.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105387745873530370384/reviews
