It tastes good, which I like.\n\nI hope the boss will consider the price:\n$4.50\n$5.50\n$6.50\n$7.50\nClassify different ingredients into different grades, which will help customers choose.\n\nChicken and pork prices should not be too high.\n\nThe market generally accepts that the price of fish, mutton and beef is higher than that of chicken and pork.\n\n01 Mar 22‚Äô\nCame here again for dinner tonight.",
