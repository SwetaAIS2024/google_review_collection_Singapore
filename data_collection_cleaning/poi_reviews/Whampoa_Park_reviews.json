A variety of playgrounds to cater for different age groups as well as an exercise area for adults too.\n\nThe highlight would be the ninja warrior like obstacle course which was the first we encountered in SG.\n\nConnected via park connectors to the canal, it’s a great stop over for a long cycling trip as well.\n\nSituated nearby is the popular Whampoa food centre which has quite a lot of stuff to cater to the dinner crowd.",

There's also small rain gardens where you can explain to your kid how natural filtration works.\n\nThere's a dog run park which is a good addition.\n\nGood choice of equipment for adults and senior citizens to work out too. Will be back again",
