      "text": "Thank you to all at Ola Beach Club for a wonderful day. Warm friendly welcome from people at watersports area and especially Rachel. S$35 for a 1 hour SUP session, good quality boards (NSP). Lovely area to enjoy the calm waters with buoys to show safe areas, even though large ships are in the bay. Secure lockers for valuables and nice shower block. My husband treated himself to a t shirt to remember our lovely day. Will definitely come back when we next in Singapore.",

      "text": "We decided to host the surprise birthday bash for one of our friends @ Ola Beach. I was assisted by the service crew staff, IwanD. He gave us a very great vibe & Rachel assisted us w/ the balloons. Of course, we didn‚Äôt took their package plans so we seek permission to just do a simple deco around our ‚ÄúDAYBED‚Äù. I advised the small plans we have for our friend & they hear us & helped us throughout.\n\nFrankly speaking, i am not a fan of beach clubs/party but coming to Ola Beach & being surrounded by friendly staffs just made our celebration better! Birthday girl loves it & thanks to Ola Beach Club & staffs. You guys are the best! üòò",

The staff is very attentive and helpful, they were very proactive to my toddler needs, offering him a beach set to play while we were there.",

There was no ‚Äúminimum spend‚Äù today, so we were able to use whichever beach chair, umbrella, table etc we wanted and the pool.\nFood and drinks are a bit $$ but not much more than you‚Äôd expect from a resort island beach club. (Cheese sticks = SHD 17.99, Singapore drink = SGD 29.99)\nWe ordered and paid using a QR code at the table and food/drinks were brought out insanely fast. Great service.\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon there were a lot of families with kids. We felt very welcome in this space.\n\nWe were able to use the pool, order food and drinks, and use the showers and changing rooms. We brought our own towels.",
