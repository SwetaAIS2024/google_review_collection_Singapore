      "text": "I bought a FavePay ecard for Khaki Yong Tau Foo in Aug 2024, but now staff at this stall refused to accept FavePay. So I still have balance on this ecard and wrote in to Fave to sort this out.\n\nGuess what? Fave claims that this vendor has been accepting FavePay on the very days in October that I had tried to pay with the my ecard. Staff at this stall are now upset that I asked multiple times to use my ecard. I have liked eating at this stall until now. Both this vendor and Fave are leaving a bad taste. So lesson learnt: don‚Äôt put your money in any stored value FavePay ecards!\n\nUpdate: now this outlet has closed down!",
