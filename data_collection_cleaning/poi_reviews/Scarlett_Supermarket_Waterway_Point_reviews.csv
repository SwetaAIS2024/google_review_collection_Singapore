Ryan Tay,4,Chinese supermarket selling titbits and snacks from Mainland China. Most of them are hardly seen elsewhere locally. Pricing are pretty decent and not expensive. This branch at Waterway Point occupies a smaller shop space than the others (eg Chinatown). But it have its own shares of unique items. Worth the time to slowly walk around and check out the items in the shop.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100123425159940281976/reviews
Sherman Tan,5,Scarlett Supermarket sells mainly china produced food products. Therefore you will find some unique and interesting types of food products here. Not the typical supermarket stuff you find locally. They also have fresh produce like vegetables and fruits. I like their super big bottle of popcorn.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108182392432223766811/reviews
