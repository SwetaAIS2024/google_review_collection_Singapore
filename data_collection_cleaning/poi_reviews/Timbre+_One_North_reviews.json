Ordered from 4 different food stalls - quality and taste of food will just consider as average.\n\nWill suggest to come in the evening when weather isn’t that hot. Do have some mosquitoes and house flies buzzing around, thus good to be in long pants if you’re not wanting a feast beneath the tables.",

Food options were a bit limited on a PH (Good Friday) but what we had was alright.\n\nDefinitely recommend this venue to meet with friends over affordable drinks and food with live music.",

I've been here multiple times and had food from various stalls/food trucks. I haven't been disappointed. This is a great place for a group of friends to hang out, was well as for an after work group to get together.\nDefinitely recommended.",
