      "text": "I ordered sliced fish with ginger and onion cooking style for takeaway, but when I opened it at home, I was shocked. It wasn't sliced fish at all. The fish pieces were heavily battered and deep-fried, then coated in a sauce, resembling more like a sweet and sour pork dish.\nI ate few pieces and found that the fish inside was soft and mushy, clearly why they used the thick batter. For $12, this was a complete misrepresentation of the dish I ordered and definitely not worth the price. I won't be buying from them again.",

The prawns given were big and fresh, pork is good and even the fish cake taste nicer than the standard dodo or lichuan that other zichar stall uses. From the selection of ingredients, we can tell that this zichar stall really put their heart into what they are cooking for their customers. üëçüëçüëç",
