      "text": "My daughter has shown significant improvement in her Chinese since joining Lu Laoshi in P5 and got an AL3 in PSLE. Taking Chinese was hard for her as she is not a native Chinese and nobody at home could speak to her in Mandarin. However, a very experienced Lu Laoshi helped her overcome this using her highly effective teaching methods. Moreover, her lessons are interactive and fun and my daughter thoroughly enjoy her lessons. Very grateful to Lu Laoshi for her constant support and guidance!",
