holoban91,5,"Uncle is no longer snappy nor rude when asking for pin, in contrast to other reviews. Is very nice in asking for the PIN and collection date. 10/10 would recommend this collection point.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103420248945223789030/reviews
Nix x,1,Old man was so rude. I get he is being careful and prefers to read the pin from our screen. There's no need to bark and be rude. Shoved the package to me when he's done scanning. I chose to not confront him solely for the reason that he's elderly.  Last time I'm gonna use this store. Shop looks creepy old and dark and badly ventilated.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101569692500698060721/reviews
sean lee,1,"The uncle consistently displays a negative demeanor and directs his frustration towards customers. So now, my friends and family have opted to collect our parcels from alternative locations(also near to us) to avoid such negativity.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118381827172826918398/reviews
Knisa,2,"Got my shopee parcel shipped here. Uncle snapped when i read out the collection pin to him. He said he'll read it himself in a rude tone. Erm ok? Unnecessarily making it an unpleasant transaction. Also, no response to my greetings lol which is fine ig. Rudeness is not.

Similar experience with previous review on here. Definitely shipping my parcels elsewhere now ✌️",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100030866978093341929/reviews
illion,5,Had many wonderful experiences here. If multiple shopee parcels are dropped here they would take the time to collate them all for you so it makes it easier to collect. Staff is always nice when I come. Had bad experiences with other shops where they don’t even entertain you so this is the best so far,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105995504965523032593/reviews
