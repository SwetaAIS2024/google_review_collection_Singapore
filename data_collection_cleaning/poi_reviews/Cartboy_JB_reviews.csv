Athirah Azizan,4,"Really nice ambiance such a pretty place to chill. Perfect for late night hangouts since they’re open till 1AM, which is a big plus.

However, the menu is quite limited. Not many choices for drinks or snacks. They only had fries and pasta when I went. Would be great if they could add more side dishes like cakes or curry puffs.

If they had shisha, it’d be even better! Definitely a nice spot to relax, just hoping to see more variety in the future.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102953246552820121934/reviews

June Sapine,3,"I’d give this place a full score for its wonderful atmosphere—it’s a really nice spot to chill. The coffee was okay, not too bad. They serve food too, though it would be helpful to have a display showing what’s available. I wanted to order something, but the staff mentioned there would be a bit of a wait not advisable. so I ended up just having coffee. Would I return? Possibly not, if it only for the ambiance.
