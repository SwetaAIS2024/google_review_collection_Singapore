The crispy fried fritters gave an additional texture to the bowl. The ingredients were generously portioned, making it a hearty meal. Be prepared for a long wait, as the queue moves slowly.",

      "text": "Aside from the large bowl of porridge, there wasnâ€™t much to compliment. The vendor had a bad attitude and was grumpy early in the morning. When I requested extra youtiao, he seemed annoyed. I also asked for an extra bowl and spoon, but he wanted to made me wait until he finished cooking other orders before giving them to me. He even remarked that the porridge wasnâ€™t good enough to justify the requests. Honestly, despite the long queue, I wouldnâ€™t recommend it at all. Only go if you want your day to be ruined.",

Donâ€™t be put off by uncleâ€™s attitude as he just want to cook the porridge well. He is actually quite nice if there is no crowd. The pork porridge cost $3, extra $0.50 for egg. Porridge is full of ingredients and crispy youtiao. Uncle is quite heavy hand with the sesame oil and pepper, so be sure to tell him in advance if you canâ€™t take pepper. Note tho that uncle will get irritated as he get confused easily if there is too much instructions on the porridge.",
