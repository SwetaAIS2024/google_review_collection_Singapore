Zoe Wang,5,"Service is great . Food is great. Clean and nice environment. No lingering smell on clothes and hair. Free flow condiments and side dishes.
Love the wagyu ribeye set. Each set comes with a main dish that u can choose from, the braised pork rice is super yummy. The dumpling is huge portion and nice too!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113485645077192254014/reviews
Melvin Lim,5,"Second time eating at City Hot Pot. We tried once at their outlet in Woodlands and it was good. As I recalled we were stuffed and we had to bring home the raw eggs which she cooked it with the hot pot soup.

This time round I visited the outlet at Guoco Towers with my GF. It was an unplanned dinner and we though just eat and head home since it's Monday.

I went for the vegetable soup (clear) and my GF had the chicken mushroom soup. Both of us ordered the pork collar but I had the udon and she wanted to try their ramen.

Nothing much to talk about.. it's individual hot pot and they are not as fancy as Haidilao. For a quick dinner, they hit the spot and if you have about 3-4 pax and above you should try other dishes. We had their mantou (Chinese bun) at Woodlands and they are pretty good.

Give it a try when you are there.. they have a good variety of soup base and you can mix your own dipping sauce.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108538147964918099161/reviews
Zuriel Mamba,4,"Enjoyed my time over here with such pleasant customer service by the team. Was already greeted by the male Taiwanese staff before even entering the place, he was making me so at ease. Next came to serve us was Wei Wei, she was quick to attend to us when we tried to enquire something.

We had the 1 for 1 wagyu beef set meal which I thought it's super worth it. Furthermore it's individual pot means i could  enjoy both spicy bases by myself üòÇ The entire set up & presenting our hotpots were prompt. The set came with a selection of noodles to opt from. In addition we were also entitled to pick up the sides, pickles & fruits from condiment counter.

We chosen 4 different types of soup bases, 2 spicy & 2 non spicy. My fave base got to be Mala, appreciate Wei Wei for responding to my request. I thought the team's service at this outlet was expectional. We had a wonderful time there.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100097027827819745483/reviews
Giselle,4,"Perfect if you hate sharing hotpot broth with others. They have a good selection of sauces(including Lao gan maüëµüå∂Ô∏èü´òüêêüêêüêê) and fruits which are free for all. The side dishes however, I do not recommend as they have a funky taste. The portion of meat and vegetables are generous but not overwhelming and the broths are alright tooüôÇ.  Not halal üò¢.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109870691315767875090/reviews
Pei Ni Richael Chua,5,"I like that their ingredients are super fresh and high quality. The highlight was definitely these wagyu slices which are beautifully marbled and simoly just melt in your mouth.
What's hotpot without a good soup base though? We had the teochew fish soup, big prawn soup, tom yam and mala, all of which were super flavorful and delicious.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117508775223353682297/reviews
