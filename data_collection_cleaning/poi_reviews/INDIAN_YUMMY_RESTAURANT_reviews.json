      "text": "I ordered six different biryanis and some starters for a dinner party. The food was delivered on time, and we received extra starters as part of the combo. We enjoyed all six biryanis, each with a unique taste. I highly recommend the Mysore mutton biryani; the mutton biryani is a must-try. The spice levels were just right, and the portions were generous. Overall, it was an absolute biryani party. Thanks to the restaurant for the great food!",
