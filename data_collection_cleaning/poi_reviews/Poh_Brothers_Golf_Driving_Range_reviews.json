      "text": "My go to place for swing practice! The range itself is spacious, spanning two floors. The range balls are in good condition, and the ball mats are well maintained. Ample parking is also available for those driving there\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the putting training area. It offers a variety of surfaces to practice on, which is perfect for honing those short game skills\n\nThere are also 3 food choices to choose from to satisfy those post-practice meal\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic spot for both beginners and seasoned golfers. The facilities are top-notch, the food is great, and the environment is super relaxed. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!",

This one is well maintained and has eateries like tenderfesh inside as a tenant, plus a cafe on the 2nd level for you to chill while you or friends practise your shots.\n\nBalls can be purchased using nets via the machine, so no cash is needed. If I remembered, it was $15 for 138 balls.",
