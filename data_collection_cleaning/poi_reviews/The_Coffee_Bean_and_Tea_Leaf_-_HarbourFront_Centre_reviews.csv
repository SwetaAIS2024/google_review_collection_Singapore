Faye Yap (叶栩绯),5,"If you want a quiet place to chill at Habourfront, go to this CBTL outlet instead of the VivoCity one. It’s much quieter and comfortable since there’s fewer people patronising this one.

Service was pretty good, they told my partner and I about the discounts they had on the cake which was a super good deal in my opinion.

I love both the carrot cake and the cake of the day, they’re really tasty and not dry.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101750484940912874032/reviews

Angela Yong,1,"Fairly quiet on a public holiday. Breakfast set for 2 is below average. Rubbery scrambled eggs, 2 mini croissants tasted meh, side salad. Overnight oats decent. The hot drink inclusive in the set cannot be changed. The Hazelnut Americano served in paper cups tasted worse than long kang water. We are dining in so why no proper coffee mugs? Do not waste your calories on this.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101868335755839904052/reviews
Carolyn Choo,3,"I was waiting for my bus to Malaysia and needed a place with free WIFI to do some work. very few plug points here but wifi was relatively stable. I was told that there were two CBTL in vivo city and i happened to be directed to this one. I enjoyed the pancake and eggs which we don't get at home. Service was poor as they were horribly understaffed and tables were not cleared, with customers having to bring our trays to the counter. I shall find the other CBTL the next round.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109617659305455075297/reviews
