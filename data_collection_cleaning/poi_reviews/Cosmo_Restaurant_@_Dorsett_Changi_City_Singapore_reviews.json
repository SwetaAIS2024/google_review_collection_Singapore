      "text": "We recently celebrated our daughter’s 1st birthday at Cosmo, and it was an absolutely wonderful experience! The atmosphere was so relaxing and spacious, filled with beautiful natural light.\n\nThe food was incredibly generous and delicious; every dish was fresh, flavorful, and plentiful. The staff were warm, attentive, and generous, making sure every detail was taken care.\n\nWe love how convenient everything was, especially the washroom being located just outside, which made things so easy for families with little ones.\n\nThank you for helping us create such a joyful and unforgettable celebration! A special thank you to Apex and his team  for making it all happen. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate!",

We were served by Khairul and Kay, and both are very friendly, attentive, and cheerful. The spread is not extensive, but enough selections and the food are fresh! It's worth a visit for a small group gathering.",

The food overall was superb with a great variety showcasing Chef Leon's talents. The ambiance was inviting, perfect for my networking event.\n\nMuz and the team provided attentive yet unobtrusive service, ensuring our needs were met while allowing us to focus on networking. The pricing was very reasonable, especially considering the high quality.\n\nI highly recommend Cosmo for hosting events or dining. Kudos to Mus, Chef Leon and the entire crew for making my partner networking event a success!",

      "text": "Not quite sure how this got 4.4 stars, maybe the clientele are primarily foreigners with different tastebuds? Strongly do not recommend.\n\nFried food at the buffet line (croquette, nuggets etc) were soft and soggy instead of crispy. Potato in the croquette was clumpy and dry, while the nugget was mushy and gross. Even doing it yourself at home with an airfryer would taste better than this place. Food was placed under heat lamps but was still cold.\n\nMains were meh.",
