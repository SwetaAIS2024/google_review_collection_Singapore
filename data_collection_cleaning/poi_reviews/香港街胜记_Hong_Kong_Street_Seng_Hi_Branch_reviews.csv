Chan Sarah,1,"We ordered from here for 2 meals because we were holding a funeral here and it was TERRIBLE both times.

Food was overly SALTY and so OVERPRICED. Please note that the menu has NO prices on it so we felt abit scammed when ordering already.

We ordered prawn paste chicken (around 10 pieces) and it also costs $25??

Genuinely AVOID THIS PLACE at all cost... the food is bad and the prices are crazy.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108704097988279367875/reviews
