Cheryl,5,"My favourite Mala outlet at Yew tee.
Prolly the best in the west imo.
It's super fragrant and flavorful, and on the oilier side.
I think ppl who likes less oil food won't like it, but I love it ‚ù§Ô∏èüòã",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106862813287616195653/reviews
memberimage,1,"Pioneer Mall location - Bad customer service. A cashier chinese lady staff at Pioneer Mall (Koufu foodcourt) on 19/10/2024, Saturday (12:00 to 1:00 pm), I chose mala items and 1 stick of fried 3 pcs small tofu cost $1.5, with GST it will cost more. I ordered all the items with less spicy. I just asked her politely ‚Äúsorry, I don‚Äôt want only this tofu‚Äù while she‚Äôs weighing the items. Then she rudely took it out with bad attitude, shouted and complained to her kitchen chef. She acted very rude with rough manner, made it look like I‚Äôm stealing. But I buy and pay money for the food politely. Not many customers at that time. Only 2 customers including me. No respect, very rudely manner and talked to the customer. Thanks management if you can take action to that cashier staff to treat nicely to the customer and not rude.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116658434041697365630/reviews
David Wong,5,"We love the soup Mala here and it is quite flavourful and not too oily. All the ingredients are priced the same regardless whether is meat or vegetables and prices are very reasonable. They also have 4 sauces at the counter for you to customize more flavour.

It is our favorite in the west area and is located inside Koufu foodcourt in the basement.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117509461354450986725/reviews
