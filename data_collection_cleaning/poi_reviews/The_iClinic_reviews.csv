WS,1,"Clinic is Opened but all Doctors on MC till 2024!

Visited 22 Dec 2023. Staff quickly states no doctor. Doctors on MC sick leave till 2024. See you next year with a wide smile...

Signage stated clinic is open but no doctor is present..... What kind of clinic is this?

Responding to Iclinic constant google map response: obviously you are the denying. Picture reflected your clinic is opened. How to be your patient when your you stated there are no doctors see patient?

Really unprofessional of a clinic to share doctors is on sick leave from 22 Dec 2023 to 2024 and yet twist your words when the photo states it is opened.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107309501537570912795/reviews

One of vanishingly very few places in Singapore that administer Novavax Covid vaccine for XBB variants (as per my visit). Appointment can be booked using Whatsapp without much fuss. The clinic is small (it's a community clinic after all) but exceedingly easy to reach because it's located right next to the MRT station.

The nurses were kind, knowledgeable, and competent in their services. They said some people did specifically come to get the Novavax jab there. It would've been an easy 5 star if they used better quality masks rather than leaky surgicals though.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
dRey Ch,1,Clinic said its open but waited more than one hour from 845am but no sound no sight. Called and WA but no one picked up the phone. Not the first time encountering clinic closure. Why bother to show operating hours when it's not adhered to or call/WA and no one answer or reply!? That is not how a clinic should treat a sick patient coming to seek help! Annoyed.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102342241268940574851/reviews

Yin L,5,"Went for a flu jab. The inside of the clinic is small but pleasant unlike one or two of the other clinics in the same vicinity that feel grotty. Counter staff were polite while the nurse handling the jab was also pleasant, competent and gentle. The cost of the jab was $38nett - I donâ€™t understand why another clinic down the row was planning to charge me $75! No Chas discount as well. Both clinics said the vaccine was for the latest Northern Hemisphere flu.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108226586062214326779/reviews
