Asia Apparel,5,"Updated with new night market gor hiong bee hoon. Very nice bee hoon and good service.

Not bad this Kopitiam. Hidden gem. Quite a number of food I like to eat.
My favorite is the Cai Peng during lunch time. Then the laksa shop has delicious laksa, always sold out by 4pm. The Indian stall is very underrated but it’s one of the best ever. Tze Char nice and reasonable price. Morning I like to have their egg, bread, Kopi set only 3.50.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112168507594751691491/reviews
Joy Lim,4,"Small coffee shop, frequent the zichar which is not bad and the lady serving chats a little when it's not so busy.  Like that it's not crowded.  New western food stall has rather good value food and sells quesadillas which is quite rare.
Being a vegetarian, the zichar stall, western food stall (vegetarian quesadillas) and Indian food can satisfy my needs.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108694888978369676816/reviews
Backyard Xplorer,4,"Update mar22
New stalls are carrot cake cubes and chilli king wanton noodle. Not sure if the zichar stall is closed for good, not seen them operating for past 2 weeks

Update dec 2021
There goes the dessert stall and come a western stall cheekylads.

Update aug 2021
Chilli king wanton noodle is located here. Not too bad for their wanton noodle

Updated jun2021
Chicken rice nicely fragrance. Chicken meat is ok but not for the char siew. Char siew abit in the hard to chew. Stall owner is friendly though

Next to the chicken rice stall is selling dessert like chendol and tua suan. Not too bad but the way this stall.is set up, dont seem like the seller is planning to be here long but just trying out if this place is suitable for his dessert

The fried hokkien mee stall no longer in operation but in place is a mokata and lok lok stall..seem pretty popular, can see many eating at the coffeeshop

Older post
Fried hokkien mee is good. The indian stall serves good prata too. Recently the coffeeshop went thru some renovation for better shelter and more seating area.

Coffee and tea here is nice here and thick, not the usual sugar water tea you find in most coffee shops.

The seafood hor fun stall is new and quite popular. Tried the yee mee, those who like lot of port lard will love it.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102260626085916018032/reviews
Sherilyn Leah Tan,5,"Small coffee shop, peaceful quiet and cozy.

New stall selling western called Cheekylads has good size portions! I’ve tried their cream pasta, grilled chicken and fish & chips.

I personally like the pasta and grilled chicken. The chicken is grilled till the outsides are crispy and still moist on the inside. The pasta portions are big, good for big eaters.

The grilled chicken with cheese is also enjoyable - they’re very generous with the cheese portions. Good for those who love cheese!

Their coleslaw is also fresh (I’m very particular about coleslaws, I seldom eat it actually) but I could savour a few mouths from this stall.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113331871920823132181/reviews
