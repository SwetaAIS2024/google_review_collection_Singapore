Angie Lim,2,"Make a first visit, everything seem good. Doctor recommend CT scan. Staff unprofessional. Did not give us the CTscan form & I still reconfirm with them that morning if I need to have the form. They say no need. End up I have to wait from them to go back clinic to fax the form to the radiology clinic before I could do the scan. Wasted almost an hour time because I have already paid for the scan at the doctor’s clinic. If not I would have walk off. Lucky the scan does not require fasting. If it does than good luck to you.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105222917398433939665/reviews
Mikey Mike,5,"Recently my wife and I brought my son to visit The Heart Doctor Clinic after a bad experience with another hospital and I cannot express enough how impressed we were with the outstanding level of care and professionalism provided by both Dr. Soon and his team.

From the moment we walked into the clinic, we were greeted by a warm and friendly staff that set the tone for a positive and an assurance experience.

Even the patient we happened to talk to, have a very positive feedback on Dr.Soong and the clinic.

Dr Soon took his time to listen attentively to our concerns, thoroughly and doesn’t push for unnecessary procedures in my son’s case, it was not necessary.
He explained clearly and the medicine he prescribed worked well.

His genuine care for patients' well-being is truly commendable.

Thank you Dr Soon and his team!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111875820397645071867/reviews
Cheng L,5,"The staff were all very efficient and precise in doing scans. The clinic has a really nice and harmonious ambience that made me feel calm.
Dr Soon also took the time to explain my conditions and scans in detail. He also reassured me constantly because it is not everyday you hear about heart conditions, some terms can be extremely difficult to understand. Really kudos to Dr Soon and his team for being so awesome and making my experience a pleasant one. Thank you once again!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636274480436128631/reviews
