      "text": "I had a disappointing experience located in the basement food court facing the escalator. The displayed pricing was $2.50 for 2 vegetables + 1 meat or $3.30 for 2 meats + 1 vegetable. However, when I ordered 1 pork dish and 2 vegetables, I was charged $5.00 instead.\n\nWhen I asked about the price responded rudely with \"yes, why what wrong?\" in an aggressive tone. I was too tired from work to argue, so I just paid and left.\n\nThis lack of pricing transparency and poor customer service is disappointing. I hope the stall improves its pricing clarity and attitude.\n\nNote: There 3 food court this store B1 facing escalator the sign board black in colour.",

Upon arrival, I noticed that there were two options for descending to the dining area: an elevator or stairs.\n\nOnce downstairs, I was presented with a variety of food stalls offering a diverse range of culinary options. Halal, non-halal, and vegetarian dishes were all available. I decided to dine at a vegetarian food stall, where I was pleasantly surprised to find that a mere $3 could purchase a substantial amount of food. However, it is important to note that the offerings were exclusively vegetarian. For those seeking a wider variety of options, further exploration of the food stalls would be advisable.\n\nthank you, and God Bless All.",

I was just a little kid back then and after more than 50 years later, I am surprised to see that it is still not renovated. In fact, many of the shops have been there for decades especially the tour travel agencies.\nI am also surprised to learn that they charge 20 cents to use the toilets which is quite uncommon these days as even big new shopping malls don't charge.\nOne unique feature that I have noticed is that there is an annoying security robot patrolling around and always asking everyone to make way as it approaches. ðŸ˜‚",
