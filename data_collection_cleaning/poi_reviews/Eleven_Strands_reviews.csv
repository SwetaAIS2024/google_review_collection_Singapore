JAO JAO,5,"Eleven Strands offers a fantastic pasta experience with rich and flavorful sauces. The white wine crab pasta was particularly outstanding—creamy, well-balanced, and absolutely delicious.

Their wine selection is reasonably priced, with both red and white wines being smooth and enjoyable. It’s a great complement to the meal.

The restaurant has a spacious and relaxing ambiance, making it an excellent spot for couples, families, or those dining with children. Highly recommended for a cozy and satisfying meal!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101237592496501407589/reviews
Joyce Lim,4,"Was thinking is juz another cafe, surprisingly food was good. We ordered the stuffed crab cake 7/10, prawn pesto pasta 8/10(must try), braised lambshank 9/10, red wine poached pear 3/10, Apple Galette 10/10. Best part is v reasonable pricing. Only negative side is the environment n location. Is kind of noisy.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104361501551944507919/reviews
Caroline L.,4,"The crab cake is yummy and a must order dish. Enjoyed the handmade spaghetti, it's springy and giving it an extra texture.

Flat bread is 9 inches, super thin crust. Definitely will come again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104269376151723151265/reviews
Genesis NΞO,3,"Visited on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, the restaurant was quite crowded. While the restaurant has a high ceiling and was quite spacious, the sound dispersion is pretty bad hence it gets very noisy when the place is crowded where everyone is chatting. I guess it would be a great place to chit chat and chill if it was crowded.

The food is where I am at a dilemma, the appetisers were great, pastas  were pretty good but the mains are hit and misses. Pork chop was bland and lacked flavors, beef was way too salty but the lamb shank was good.

Another plus for the restaurant is the ingredients used were of good quality and coffee was good.

The pizzas and dessert does looks great but I didn't tried any so it's not part of my review.

Not sure if it's a consistency issue but I would personally think it's not worth the price if the mains are as poor as the ones we had.

Last advice is try not to sit near the entrance during hot afternoon as the heat  penetrates the glass panels and the area can get pretty warm.

Overall it's a decent place to have pasta and coffee but due to its location, I personally do not think it is worth the trip.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102854124263961361309/reviews
Jeffrey Ng,5,"The noise level becomes quite intense when the restaurant is packed, with everyone chatting away. It’s easy to see how this could be a great spot to relax and catch up if it were less busy, but during peak hours, the noise might detract from the otherwise pleasant atmosphere.

That said, the food truly made up for it, with several standout dishes that are worth mentioning.

The truffle fries lived up to their reputation, not only did they exude an enticing truffle aroma that immediately whets your appetite, but they were also perfectly fried to achieve just the right level of crispness.

The pesto pasta was another dish we absolutely loved. It struck a wonderful balance in flavor—distinctly pesto without being overpowering. The subtlety in the seasoning meant it was easy to enjoy the dish without feeling overwhelmed, making it one of the better pesto pastas we’ve had.

The BBQ pork ribs were an absolute delight. Cooked to perfection, the meat was incredibly soft and tender, falling off the bone effortlessly. Unlike some ribs we’ve tried in the past that tend to be overly tough or chewy, these were wonderfully succulent and flavorful. They’re a testament to the chef’s skill in preparing comfort food with finesse.

For dessert, the apple crumble was simply outstanding. The crumble was perfectly golden and crispy, while the apple filling was warm, sweet, and spiced just right. Paired with creamy vanilla ice cream, the combination was indulgent and satisfying—a fantastic way to end the meal.

Overall, while the noise level during busy times might be a consideration, the quality of the food and the lively atmosphere make this restaurant worth visiting. If you’re a fan of truffle fries, flavorful pasta, or perfectly cooked BBQ ribs, this place won’t disappoint. For a more relaxed experience, it might be best to visit during off-peak hours, but either way, the food is bound to leave a lasting impression.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114361573681952194788/reviews
