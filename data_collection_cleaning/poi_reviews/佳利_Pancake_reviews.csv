Danny Kwok,5,"Good snacks for young and old. Our favorite is chocolate, ham and cheese. Be prepared to wait if it is very crowded. You can order early but it is nice while hot. If it is cold, you can bake it reheat. Pricing is standard for HDB area. Best time to go is off peak during 3-5pm, timing for your tea break snacks.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100941619232436573829/reviews
Gra Cious,5,Traditional Ming Jiang Kuey with a modern twist to suit our new style of having in many choices to chose from. They are also serving the traditional simplicity of coconut | peanut | red bean. With improvised equipment and smaller size makes this local delight not a usual breakfast item but a quick snack with reasonable pricing anytime of the day. üëçüèªü§©,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109273620955046692829/reviews
