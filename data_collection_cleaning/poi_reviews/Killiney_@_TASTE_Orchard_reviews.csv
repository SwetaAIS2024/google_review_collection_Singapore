Joe C.H. Ng,4,Chicken curry was thick and aromatic but portion of curry was lesser than expected (pieces of meat were adequate). Also ordered hot Yuan Yang and it tasted bland…thus best to stick to just to coffee or tea.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101412856189523387954/reviews
Potato Head,3,"Well known local coffee shop.
Nothing much but good place to try local atmosphere and food.

Lyndy Goh,1,"Please do not bother coming here. Slow service in a Wednesday morning, with only 3 other tables of customers. We waited for close to 20mins for our food, and we had to prompt them again even after 20 mins.
The staff all seem pretty inexperienced as you could tell that nobody knows what’s happening.
From the video of the curry chicken, I think there’s not much to be said. We have never come across such watery and bland curry chicken.
Needless to say, this is our first and last time patronizing.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107345568617405894065/reviews
