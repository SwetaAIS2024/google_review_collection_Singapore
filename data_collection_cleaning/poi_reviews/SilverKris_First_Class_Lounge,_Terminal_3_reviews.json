      "text": "The location is the same as the Silverkris business class lounge, the difference is that the business class lounge is straight, while the first class lounge turns left. Then turn left, if you turn left again to The Private Room, while the first class lounge continues.\n\nThe Singapore Airlines first class lounge can be entered by Singapore Airlines first class ticket holders, Star Alliance airline first class ticket holders, and PPS Solitaire.\n\nThe First Class lounge is quite spacious, there are lots of seats and many are empty too, but at certain times it is quite crowded, there is a bar, 4 bedrooms with tempur beds (can be used again for a maximum of 2 hours if no one is using them) and also a shower room. Food is served, there are breakfast, lunch and dinner menus are different.\n\nBecause it was already night when we arrived in Singapore, we got the dinner schedule. For the menu there are:\n1. Beer, TWG tea, fresh orange juice machine, coffee machine, coconut water (by request), soft drinks\n2. Fried beehoon, gyoza, pao, hakau, siomay, porridge, soup, cheese ravioli, spiced chicken\n3. Pork belly with salted vegetables, sweet potato, long beans, briyani rice, Indian food\n4. A la carte fresh to made breakfast dishes (clam pasta, Hokkian noodles, satay, carrot cake, pork burger, prata bread, laksa) for lunch the choices are (carrot cake, truffle mushroom pizza, lu rou fan, laksa, Indian flat bread, pork burger, Hawaiian pizza)\n5. Indian bread, vanilla strawberry and chocolate Movenpick ice cream, box juice, nuggets, spring rolls, curry puffs\n6. Sandwiches, cakes, puddings, fruits, nuts, cheese, matcha parfait, cereal, bread, Nyonya kueh\n7. Sushi (egg lobster salad gunkan, Aburi Salmon Maki)\nThe sushi was incredibly delicious.",

      "text": "They've just revamped the First Class Lounge here at Terminal 3, as part of the total SilverKris experience. It's located next to the Business Lounge, and next to the Private Room.\n\nEverything is much quieter, more peace, calm, and some extra levels of service. Make sure you try the food menu from the chef's station, you can't possibly go wrong there. I really liked their herbal chicken soup as well, as that keeps my experience here very grounded and enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, a great lounge.",
