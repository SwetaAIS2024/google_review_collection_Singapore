      "text": "+ The stall seems to also own the entire coffeeshop previously.\n\n+ Located in quiet hidden corner of the estate. Less hot and expensive compared to the other nearby coffeeshop at 209B Clementi Ave 6.\n\n+ Ample sheltered MSCP parking next door.\n\n- Few other stall options in this coffeeshop if your companions want to try something else.",
