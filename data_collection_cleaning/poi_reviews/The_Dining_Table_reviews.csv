Ng Poh Lye,5,I've been dining here often recently cos I really love the food as well as the clean and spacious environment. I also like that they did not compromise on the quality and portion of their food even though they are priced so cheaply.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101054360163165217990/reviews
fayra chin,5,"I went to try their double cheese beef burger after hearing good reviews of their burgers. It certainly didn't disappoint, the beef patties are really thick and juicy.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109918860139876754431/reviews
Ryan Koh,1,"This is what u get for the western food, the picture has fries, coleslaw etc. In reality only 2 piece of fish and wet veggies.
Won't be coming back here again. Better to eat at the terrace or other shops",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115622943528588485277/reviews
Andrew T,1,Tried to give this place multiple chances but it just keeps disappointing. Ordered the aglio olio for $3.50 and it tasted as bad as it looked.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105273963189460072918/reviews
Bill Ong,1,"Ordered at 1+pm, waited for half an hour, saw people that arrived much later get their food first. Checked with the staff whether my order has already been processed, was told food is on the way but staff couldn’t provide an estimate when it’ll be done. Obviously haven’t started to cook yet. Cancelled order and got a refund.
The kitchen clearly needs to be more organized in processing orders.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118014850868755698832/reviews
