Essper Tan,2,"Quite a bad place to pick from if you're looking for a fun time to sing songs due to its facilities. The app is not user friendly and even the download app on the phone is not updated. They don't have any songs, it's all 1-2years old songs on the phone, you will need to use the in-house tablet to select the latest song which is not user friendly.
On the start, I came in into the room with mic that is not serviceable due to lack of battery and follow up the room door is not serviceable, it will not shut properly....but it could be just the room (E05) is not very good.

Overall, this place is such a let down as compare to Bugis Cube outlet. I will still prefer Bugis Cube outlet.

Jamie Tan,4,"Not bad, the had drinks and mixers available the rooms were pretty clean. The food was average abit oily for the prawn rolls, but apart from that it’s fine. The food was mainly just deep fried frozen food. Everything else was alright",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105850067618557777884/reviews
Joanne Teh,3,"Overall, everything was just ok. The people working weren't really interested in anything and rarely paid attention. The atmosphere was ok, the couch had a few stains but the lighting is good. Heard about the baby roaches but luckily I didn't see any. The choice of songs are amazing (mostly on the older side) and easy to pick.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113281190028478193361/reviews
Yiping Sun,5,"We feel so welcomed with the service provided by Alicia and Bernard! We came on 冬至, and asked Bernard if we can order rice ball. Bernard told us initially that it's not served, but Alicia and Bernard paid a surprise visit to our room with 3 cups of rice balls. It's so heartwarming! Thank you, Alicia and Bernard, for your care and service! Will definitely visit again!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102425534942506473585/reviews
