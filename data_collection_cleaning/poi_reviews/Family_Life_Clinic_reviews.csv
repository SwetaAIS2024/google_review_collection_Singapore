Eliza,1,The receptionist was very rude to me when I entered. She told me to “mask on” and I told her I didn’t have a mask and asked her if she has a spare. She then proceeded to tell other people “headache” and skipped my turn to register. I then walked out awkwardly. Rude.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117941646762037574832/reviews

SaltwaterFlyTillIDie R35,5,"Probably the best doctor that I've ever seen in my 61 years!!
Went to the clinic last thursday evening for what I thought was just a normal flu infection. Wait was a bit long but that's coz it was the only clinic open in that area at the time. Was my 1st time visiting this clinic and Dr David Lim patiently asked me about my symptoms, my health history and listened to my breathing. He then proceeded to also check the oxygen level in my blood. I could see that he seemed rather concerned with the result and started to use the device to check a few other fingers. He then used another similar device to check my blood oxygen levels, in case the 1st device wasn't working properly.
With a look of concern, he informed me that I should go to the hospital immediately as my blood oxygen was dangerously low. He offered 3 times to call an ambulance for me but I told him that I was able to make my own way there. He kept asking me if I was feeling breathless and if I would be able to drive the short distance home. I assured him that I would be able to as I wasn't feeling breathless or light-headed. He then prepared a letter for me to present to the A&E folks at the hospital.
True enough that when I reached the hospital (in a cab), the staff there reacted with the appropriate urgency after reading his letter and I was wheeled into the treatment area. I was quickly given oxygen and a doctor came to see me shortly. Then, he sent me for a chest x-ray and took some blood for tests.
While waiting to be warded, a call came in on my mobile. I was wondering who was calling me at almost 11 pm in the night. Turned out that it was Dr Lim calling to find out about my status! I thanked him for his call and related what had happened in the hospital.
The next morning at around 10, I received another call again from Dr Lim to find out how I was feeling and whether the doctors had shed any more light as to what was ailing me.
I am so impressed with his concern and care for his patient and to think that I was only seeing him for the 1st time and not one of his regular patients. I'm fairly sure that most other GP's would have treated my case as common flu and just sent me back home with the appropriate meds.
Who knows what could have happened then?? It's possible that I could have collapsed later that night at home, with no one around to help me. Whether or not I would have collapsed, I feel that I owe Dr David Lim a huge Thank You for possibly saving my life. The least that I can do is let the world know what a fantastic doctor he is. Needless to say, he will henceforth be my regular doctor :-)
P.S.
The counter staff (dyed red hair) that I encountered that night at his clinic was pleasant and polite, even though I could see that she was the only staff and rather busy.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104086967169568665756/reviews
HuiLing Zhuo,3,"Doctors are good but the attitudes of counter staff  definitely needs improvement!
We require assistance for the wheelchair ramp to be placed at entrance. Obviously one of the ladies was doing nothing and yet asked us to wait.
My helper ended up putting the wheelchair ramp herself.
Saw a patient complaining of the long waiting time and the staff just said “hello it’s according to the queue” without explaining or apologising. What an attitude!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107025154250440855254/reviews
Peter Kong,5,I am very touched by Dr Lim’s recent care and attentions to my mother. He truly went above and beyond his call of duty. Clementi is truly blessed to have him serving our community.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105460473446323390960/reviews
