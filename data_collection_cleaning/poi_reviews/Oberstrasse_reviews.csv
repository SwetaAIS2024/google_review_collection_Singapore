Alan Tan,4,"A nice, quiet cafe located at a quiet neighbourhood (on weekends). The coffee is good, the food is ok. What I like is how the restaurant is so bright and the full glass window extended throughout the width of the cafe gives so much vibe on a lazy Sunday morning. Bonus points that they have 3 little tables that are pet friendly.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103801214611209064283/reviews
Zy Tan,4,"Tom yum pasta was tasty, but portion was small.
We ordered the fennel rosti, but couldn't really taste the fennel in it. Poached egg was surprisingly quite tasteless, not sure why.
Cajun chicken was kinda a miss - it was greasy and didn't taste like much. But the grilled cauliflowers and tater tots which came with it was nice.
Overall, decent place!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111980790781970783722/reviews
Chong Wenn Fang,4,"Nice crisp on the outside and deliciously non-greasy rosti.
Well-balanced sauce for cabonara and the creaminess is subtle instead of being overly heavy.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113310750148978349519/reviews
Vanessa Tan,5,"Highly recommend the beef steak and eggs. Meat was tender, tasty and done as requested (medium). At a price of $26 flat with no sneaky charges upon payment, I would say this dish was well worth the money! I didn‚Äôt realise the dish came with 3 eggs!

A friend got the steak sandwich and the bread was crispy, buttery, soft. I would try that next time! üòç

I like that we could pay for our individual meals here via Apple Pay easily.

It wasn‚Äôt very crowded during brunch time but started to fill up around lunch time!

Service was pleasant, and had free refills of lemon water! Which is much appreciated from the crazy heat!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110679538561876302414/reviews
Amelia Yeo,3,"The food was quite disappointing. It felt high in cholesterol. We ordered the Breakfast Fennel Rosti ($19) and the Steak & Eggs ($26). The rosti was a little bit greasy but still acceptable. The avocado was generous and well sliced. The poached eggs didn't have any flavour, there's no eggy taste, it just didn't have a taste which is strange. Overall this dish was still acceptable.

The Steak & Eggs is something I would definitely not recommend. We ordered the doneness of the steak to be ""Medium"" but at least a third of the steak seemed Medium Rare or even Rare. It was objectionable for me and I had to try not to think about it when I ate it. The meat was red and chewy. The only thing good about this dish is probably the juicy vine tomatoes.

We ordered the Hojicha Latte which was alright.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112471798900577551918/reviews
