      "text": "2nd generation owner of this zi char stall is now running this restaurant. The place is air-conditioned, so you can dine in relative comfort.\n\nThe owner specializes in steamed dishes, though they have other wok-fried dishes.\n\nWe had the following dishes:\n- Steamed song fish head with black bean sauce topped with pork lard, which was delicious. So beware of the fine fish bones!\n- Steamed pork patty with good quality salted fish. Good portion of meat. Tasty\n- Watercress soup with pork ribs. Soup was tasty. Good for 4.\n- Tofu with prawns. The waiter suggested large which comes with more prawns, but the amount of tofu was way more than we could finish and we had to arrange for the balance to be packed. Better to order the small portion that will be just nice for 4.\n\nOverall food was good and comes to your table rather quickly after placing your order.\n\nParking on a weekend can be a challenge during peak dining hours.",

      "text": "Did not live up to expectations. Ordered 4 dishes. The beef kailan was best among them. Kailan was just right. Even the stem was nice and soft. The beef was good but could be better. The fish could have been more flavourful. The tofu was good hot but not so when cooled (a tad sourish) and the prawns were over cooked. The minced pork was so-so. Overall an OK meal but not \"blown away\" in terms of flavour. Service was generally good. Food came rather promptly. Setting was normal.",

The vege n soup was also within expectation. The steam salt fish pork and bitter guord pork ribs is yummy. The disappointment was the tofu prawns. The tofu is bit too soft and sauce is thin. The prawns are fresh. We still enjoyed the food but next time we will order small size for the tofu prawns",

      "text": "Food served was horrendous. I ordered four items:\n\nSoup: Too salty\nMinced pork with salted fish: Bland and mushy.\nStir-fried vegetables: Some parts were burnt and overly salty, likely due to too much soy sauce and excessive heat. There was no wok hei at all.\nSteamed chicken: Bland and oily.\n\nAdditionally, all three dishes were served at different times. By the time the chicken arrived, my vegetables were lukewarm to cold. The tea tasted like colored water, completely lacking in flavor.\n\nI'm baffled by the number of recurring customers. Did the chef have a bad week? Burning vegetables is such a rookie mistake, and the overall lack of care in preparation was evident. Let's not even discuss presentation or how Cantonese food is supposed to be 清淡 (light); it was definitely bland and oily. The entire dining experience was extremely disappointing.",
