      "text": "I recently had a disappointing experience at hougang village wet pasar the vegetable stall. It appears that the cashier (auntie) has been charging inconsistently. For the exact same items, I received two different receipts with different weights and prices — which is quite troubling.\n\nDuring my visit, I was charged $72, which seemed unusually high, as I typically spend around $50 for a similar amount of groceries. I requested a receipt and reviewed it item by item with my helper, but no matter how we checked, the total didn’t make sense.\n\nTo clarify, we queued again with the same items and asked the auntie to weigh and calculate everything once more. The second receipt was different — fewer items were listed, and items like coriander and spring onions, which were previously given for free, were now charged an additional $2. Even after this second calculation, the total came to $71 — still inconsistent and unclear.\n\nWhat’s most concerning is that the same items were weighed and priced differently between the two receipts. This kind of discrepancy feels careless at best and dishonest at worst. I hope the management will look into this and ensure fair and transparent pricing for all customers. Thanks",
