They were also very patient when explaining topics and concepts i didn’t understand well and made lessons very engaging and fun :3",

Other than giving more work to practise, I decided to let him go  Dunn Dunn learning style consultation by Dr Darren Chua. From here, I will get to know what actually suit him, example like environment, the best attitude of learning etc. Together with this, easier as a parent to guide too. Will get my younger so to do the same soon. I really hope that I can know this much earlier, this can be start as early as P1. Thank you Dr Darren Chua!",
