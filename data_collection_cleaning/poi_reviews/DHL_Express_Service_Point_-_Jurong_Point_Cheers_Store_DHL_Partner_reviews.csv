Triple 888 AGLITZ,1,"Please can you guys make customers have faith in your services. My fianc√©e had paid to use your service and we end up in a very critical situation. It has brought us sleepless night . Last week 1/12/2023 my fianc√©e sent me a waybill containing DSLR CAMERA üì∑ and till the moment the india custom department had being requesting for commercial invoice, I have sent every document they requested of me but up till this minute they are still requesting for the commercial invoice because the invoice your office issued to my fianc√©e was rejected 8 times I uploaded it to the link and email sent to me by the india DHL New Delhi branch . I consider this as a poor service. I urge and Please your team to look into this issue as soon as possible.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100256087087697597463/reviews
Archana Supramaniam,1,"I informed the staff over the phone that my shipment is abt 2kg. She then said that she will provide me a box that would fit my item well and can hold up to 4kg. Subsequently when I called to schedule a pickup, I was told that I would have to pay a $328 for 4kg even though the items in the box is worth only $120 and no more than 2kg. The customer service officer insist that I should pay for 4kg just because the box could carry that weight regardless of how heavy the items i have placed inside weigh. I am trying to figure out how reasonable this is.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104975854049901036046/reviews

First time trying to deliver at about 10pm on a Friday night!2nd time trying to deliver at 6.22pm on a Saturday, expecting me to wait whole day for them.
