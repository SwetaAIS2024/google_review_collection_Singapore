Vicq,4,"Bustling on a Chinese New Year holiday morning even though only drinks stall, Chao Yuan noodle stall and Yi Ji economical rice stall open. Of course food has a surcharge.  Noodle stall is ever popular with people queuing so prepare to queue for at least 15mins.
The only gripe is that the coffeeshop is beside an open area where smokers gather to smoke and help you become active 2nd hand smokers.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106473378023729080154/reviews

Gator,4,"Another new coffee shop opened in the vicinity. This place used to be CK selling daily items.

A number of new stalls located within the coffee shop. They have stalls selling bread, lor mee, roasted pork, char siew, bah kut teh, pork noodles, mixed rice, Muslim food and fried chicken. As it’s new, the place was packed when we visited. Difficult to find seats as there were a number of people drinking beer at the tables.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
Foh Kuek Yong,5,"We were there for our lunch this afternoon at 11:30 and I accidentally dropped my wallet in the shop after paying at the famous Margaret Drive Sin Kee Chicken Rice store without realising it; it was picked up by the elderly man who works in the coffee shop as a cleaner. He then passed on to a lady customer who then acted promptly and civic-mindedly by calling my name while holding my IC walking around the shop intending to find the wallet’s owner. I heard she called my name and my daughter approached her to claim my wallet, she was very professional in verifying whether I am really the “lost and found wallet’s” owner by asking my IC No and other contents in the wallet.
I would like to convey my sincere and heartiest appreciation to the shop’s elderly man cleaner and this professional lady customer for their kind hearted acts that could only be experienced in Singapore.
