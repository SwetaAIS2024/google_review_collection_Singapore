Ordered some of their other dishes and they are good as well. Minced pork tofu (gravy goes well with rice), sweet and sour pork (crispy and good bites), good portion of 青龙菜 as well etc and reasonable pricing:)",

      "text": "Checked out the zhichar stall at the newly refurbished coffeeshop opposite Chai Chee Decathlon. Chanced upon this stall yesterday while I was having the western food from the same coffeeshop. Came back here the following day to try. Stall wasn't busy, we were able to order immediately.\n\nOrdered 3 dishes, sambal sweet potato leaves, hotplate beancurd and the pork ribs. We didn't had to wait long before our food is served. Food was not bad, personally like the beancurd dish the most, the gravy was nice and goes well with rice. The rest of the dish were fine but nothing extraordinary for me.\n\nOverall the food was not bad, wouldn't mind coming back again to try their other dishes. Noticed that their menu also has items like bbq stingray etc.",

Tried their other fried noodles like claypot noodles… average, not as good as the mee goreng.\nLocated in coffeeshop.",

Speedy service, from parking car to tapao to getting out of carpark, all within grace period, impressive. Staff may be a little disgruntled but not to the point of being abrasive. Will be back to try more dishes.",
