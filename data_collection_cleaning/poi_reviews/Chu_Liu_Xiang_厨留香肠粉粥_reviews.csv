Derrick Lin,3,"Was disappointed when we noticed that the old chee chiong fun stall has ceased operations so we decided to give this new stall a try…not sure if the standard for the previous stall is so high, this one pales in comparison to it. Stall owners are not friendly too, plus there’s quite a long waiting time even there’s not much orders before us.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105989843156970934066/reviews
