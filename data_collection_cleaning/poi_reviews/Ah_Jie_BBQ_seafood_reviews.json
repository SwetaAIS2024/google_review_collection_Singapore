Staffs are polite and smiling face. Take time to serve our food.\n\nSambal sauce not really spicy to me. Level three of the spiciness foods. I personally think the sambal squid set or sting ray set with rice, the  food is small.",

Here for dinner on Sunday early evening.\n\nHad bbq stingray, squid, marinated cockles (can choose doneness), fried spring roll and etc....\n\nLove the sambal chilli they used; it reminds me of another stall I used to go but was closed down.\n\nEverything is good, but sambal sotong is abit too oily.\nPersonally didn't like the fried chicken as too much flour,  maybe would have been better if no flour?\n\nHope they can maintain the standard!\n\nHERE 19 MAY 24",
