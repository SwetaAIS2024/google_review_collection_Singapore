Alison Joy,3,"Visited Late afternoon on public holiday. Was not crowded. Was attended to immediately. Food and drinks ok.
Noise level tolerable except when staff cleans the table after customer left and began dragging/pushing chairs back after cleaning the area! Learn to lift the chairs guys!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102477971098017065179/reviews

stay healthy #budaklari,4,"Location: at B2. Difficult to find. Rm5 per parking per entry.

Atmosphere: have live band during dinner time. Difficult to have decent conversation. Best if you enjoy music while eating.

Food: love it but it’s quite pricey.

Waitress: im expecting their being friendly, but they are so into their work.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107777932215996605482/reviews
