The other dishes were pretty great, except for the chestnut pork belly which is kinda too jelat for my familyâ€™s liking.",

Came with a generous serving of fresh fish, yam, veg and delicious soup. The fish roe came separate, crunchy and fresh. Dip everything into the delicious garlic chili sauce ðŸ˜‹\n\nWe also had the prawn paste chicken. Itâ€™s alright but not great.\n\nBeer is a must!",

      "text": "Craving for a hearty and flavorful steamboat experience? Whampoa Keng's fish head steamboat here is a must-try. The fish is always incredibly fresh, and the thick, savory soup adds so much depth to each bite. The prawn rolls are a standout â€“ consistently yummy, packed with flavor. As for the cereal prawns, while they're decent, they don't quite compare to the other dishes. Iâ€™ve brought many of my overseas friends here, and every time, they leave satisfied. Even my daughter loves the steamboat, making it a perfect spot for family meals. It's always a delight!",
