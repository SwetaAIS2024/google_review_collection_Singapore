Duane Bong,5,"Quiet and peaceful environment with beautiful landscaped swimming pools and gardens.

Marble and real wood parquet floors given the interiors a luxurious feel and the built-in wine chiller is a nice finishing touch.

For those who drive, each dwelling gets a private lift lobby coming up from the car park. For those who don't, a shuttle bus runs 21 times per day from the development. It goes to the nearest MRT station and also to Coronation Plaza where there is a supermarket and a few eateries.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102632297261408686651/reviews
