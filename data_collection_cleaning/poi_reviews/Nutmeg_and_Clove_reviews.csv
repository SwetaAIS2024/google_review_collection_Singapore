Kenny Yap,4,"Vibey bar especially at night when they dim down the lights. Nutmeg and clove is on the top 50 bars list and deservingly so.

We started off with their happy hour cocktails for $16++, and they come with some delicious free flow fried chicken sandwiches which was nice and toasty. Cocktails itself was packed with flavors and they don’t hold back with the alcohol.

We initially were seated at the bar area but requested to move to the table seats as it was too noisy being seated at the bar. We also had our dinner there but some dishes I would probably skip. The CBS and HCG ribs were really good, rendang M&C and fried carrot cake was nothing special and just normal carby dishes like what you would find anywhere else. We saw the table beside having truffle fries, curry hummus, the pendai fish and CQ chicken wings. While we thought they looked delicious and glanced at their food one too many times, they barely touched it before finishing the drinks and left.

We proceeded to order round 2 of drinks, and I had pretty unique matcha drink with salted jasmine foam, of course with whiskey as it’s a cocktail. Pretty interesting and if you’re a cafe person it’s hard to say no to this, but for $26++ I would wish for some explanation and a little smaller piece of ice.

Overall great vibes and an extension and well documented menu. Love the small details like having a coaster for water (which is poured before you are seated) and another one for cocktails.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105256927610815725781/reviews

Fitriana Dyah,4,"Very unique selections of cocktails! Unpretentious place which makes it a great place to catch up with friends over drinks and nibbles. We ordered the signature nutmeg and cloves, ripple 75, the famous rendang mac & cheese and pork chips. Definitely one of the world’s best bars!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111312924429931985420/reviews
Brittany Grogan,5,"Had an incredible evening at Nutmeg & Clove. My partner and I had two cocktails each and they were all unique and delicious, and we wished we could try several more. I also love the lovely menu they've put together highlighting all of the community members they support with their cocktails. For food we just had the carrot cake and truffle fries, but both were outstanding. The carrot cake was a unique take on the dish, with much bigger pieces that are so crispy on the outside and so soft and pillowy on the inside, I was obsessed. We also had excellent service.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103628543000164712641/reviews
