Antony Swift,5,"What a great place and vibe!!! It’s a must visit place. The music, ambience, staff, service, everything about it is great. Plus they know how to pour Guinness. Sam and his team are pretty cool.. I went next door (Sam’s other bar) for Sunday roast, food quality was equally spot on. When you’re in Katong, check this place out.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101352740976866720858/reviews
