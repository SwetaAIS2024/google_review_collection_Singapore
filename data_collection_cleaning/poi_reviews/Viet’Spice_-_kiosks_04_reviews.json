Correctfully afterwards are the fresh ingredients (carrots, herbs) added. It tastes okay, but unfortunately the baguette is much too crispy because of the time it was in the oven. It could also be juicier for my taste with a bit more sauce.",

(I prefer butter over mayo).\n\nI've been to hawker stalls that don't bother toasting the bread, so I appreciate it. Of course, this means you have to wait a few minutes for it.\n\nThe woman behind the counter was nice.",

There is a huge difference between the product displayed and the product I purchased. I asked you to put salad in the sandwich. You just put a lettuce and a carrot. This product is not worth the money I paid. I will report this place to the tourism police.",
