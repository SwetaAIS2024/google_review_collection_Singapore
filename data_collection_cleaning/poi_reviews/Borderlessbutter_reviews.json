      "text": "Always a huge fan of flavoured butter because it just elevates your entire eating experience by levels ‚ú®. Arden handcrafts Artisanal Butter in really unique flavours and they just truly hit üòç.\n\nüåü Chunky Miso Shiitake\nYou really get some shiitake chunks within so you know it's the real deal ;). The Miso butter was really fragrant and savoury, which just paired so so well with the sourdough toast!! Really, just top it up with cheese and airfry your toast. Perfect combination of miso flavours, melted cheese and a sour twang from the sourdough and sun-dried tomatoes ü§§. Spreading this to plain bread is more than enough to add good flavours.\n\nSundried Tomato and Basil\nTomato butter was pretty light yet elevates the tomato flavours of the sourdough I bought to pair with. Such a great addition, and I just loved how her different butters can truly elevate and change up the flavours of your food so so well!",
