      "text": "We got our tiles for the main floor and both bathrooms from HupKiong, and we’re really happy with the whole experience. Xin Yan, the salesperson, was super patient and really took the time to explain all the do’s and don’ts when it comes to picking tiles for different parts of the house. E.g, she mentioned that the toilet wall tiles shouldn’t be too rough and for floor tiles, you need a certain resistance to prevent from being too slippery.\n\nWhat really impressed us was how quickly she understood our style. After sharing our moodboard, she was able to narrow down the options for us and made the whole tile selection process much faster. One of her best suggestions was the Marrakech Ivory tiles for our common bathroom feature walls. It matched our main bathroom tiles perfectly, and the mix of colours and textures really turned out gorgeous.\n\nEven during the reno, Xin Yan was super helpful. She sent over photos of the tiles so that our designer could use them in the VR tour and 3D renderings, which made it so much easier for us to visualise the final look. Overall, she was a huge help, and we’re really happy with the service. Highly recommend to visit HupKiong for their tiles selection and look for Xin Yan if you need help with tiles! Really happy with how our space turned out to be :)",
