Triveshni Sharma,3,"I ordered the matcha and red bean pancake and latte. The presentation of the food was beautiful (insta worthy) however, the pancakes are 80% cooked. This is known from the outset. After eating the pancakes, I got a tummy ache for a good while. Therefore, if you can't stomach food which is 80% cooked, this place isn't for you. I did not enjoy the texture much either. I felt like some parts were well cooked and I could taste batter in other portions. Since it is cooked 80%, takeaways are not allowed. My friend ate the mixed berry pancake and he really liked it. He did not get a tummy ache so it just depends. Service was fine. The atmosphere is also good. The cooking style didn't sit right with my stomach unfortunately. Taste wise, the pancake was nice (apart from the uncooked batter).",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116296246389883887621/reviews

Nicholas Thiaga,4,"We ordered the 4pcs and 8pcs pancake, sandwich, latte and hot chocolate. Pancakes were soft and fluffy. Hot chocolate was thick and tasty. Latte was normal. Sandwich was normal too. Nice small place to dine it. Price at a higher side. Overall a good place for pancake lovers.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114195287381212137932/reviews
Roseanne,5,"The pancake is delicious and tastes different from the ones Iâ€™ve tried at other shops.

When we queued and told the staff there were three of us, a couple came to look at the menu in front of us. The staff asked them and let them in first. I was a bit upset, but fortunately, there was a table available for us.

Two drinks and the pancake with additional two scoops of ice cream were served, but the last drink took a long time to arrive.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106601980837573461927/reviews
