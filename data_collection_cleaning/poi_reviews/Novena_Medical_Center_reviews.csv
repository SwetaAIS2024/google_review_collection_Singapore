Jasmine Kiki,1,"I am from Indonesia and i want to tell my bad experience with this clinic,  last october i visited this clinic to consult my daughter who is suspected to have vitilogo , after the consultation they suggested a therapy for our 7-year-old daughter with a quite expensive fee, at that time the therapy cost that’s already listed suddenly doubled , it felt so strange, they advised us to travel to singapore many times in a period of 5 weeks to do therapy 3 times a week, can you imagine how much money will be spent?? after we return to Indonesia we found out that the doctor we met at the clinic novena was not a specialist, so we decided not to come back again and look for a dermatologist at mount elisabeth hospital, after we met the dermatologist, he only suggested us to buy a home treatment tool at an affordable price, we can use it at home so we don't need to travel many times to singapore, and the specialist doctor told us that the drugs given to our daughter from the novena clinic are drugs with corticosteroid content which certainly have bad side effects for children, if you experience problems with vitiligo we recommend that you do not go to this clinic, immediately see the right dermatologist.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111963684699312798748/reviews
