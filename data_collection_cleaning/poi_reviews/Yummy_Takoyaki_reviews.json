Was not even sure if it was safe for consumption at that point, since it probably had been sitting in the sauce for a while. Pls be more careful with food prep time.",

This level of customer service is rare and much appreciated.\n\nOverall, the food was great, and the service was exceptional. I look forward to ordering again and try the seaweed topping if available.\n\nThank you",

Since I was already there I thought I should just buy. And buy I did. It was a family favourite (sans the Dad cos he only eats healthy food). Not saying takoyaki is unhealthy but I suspect the sauce contains sugar and flavorings (eat in moderation, then its okay).",
