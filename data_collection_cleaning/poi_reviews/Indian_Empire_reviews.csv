Dhanan Jayan,1,"I bought fried rice with chicken tikka, but it tasted average. The rice wasn't flavorful, it like white rice. When I asked for a spoon, they said they didn't have any and told me to get one from a nearby other Indian shop. Not impressed with the service.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118415604080753701246/reviews
