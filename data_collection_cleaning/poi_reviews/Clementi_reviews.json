It's also extremely well connected to all the neighboring malls, sheltered, easy access, etc. Lastly, there's also the bus interchange that will bring you further to other parts of town.\n\nThat said, it's unfortunately extremely crowded, all times of the day. Especially during peak hours, you'll want to either avoid, or factor in extra time.",
