      "text": "Staff were nice generally and the doctor explained in detail. However the waiting time is very long. Reached the clinic about 1020 and only got to see the doctor around 1130 despite being told there were only 4 people before me. After seeing the doctor, they said the doctor wanted to do a review. I asked how long it would take and the staff told me it would be quite fast. Waited almost 30 minutes (with my son screaming and crying as he was hungry and tired) but it was still not our turn for the review. In addition, the staff were not much help. everyone could hear my son screaming non stop and I asked twice how much longer it would take and they just said doctor hasnâ€™t called yet. Had to ask the staff to cancel because my son fell asleep.\n\nTotal time spent: 2 hours, Cost: $338",

His clear and detailed explanations helped us understand the diagnosis and the prescribed medication. Additionally, the nursing staff, especially the Indian nurse whose name I did not get, she was very patient and friendly which made the entire visit even more pleasant. Highly recommend Dr. Tan and his team!",
