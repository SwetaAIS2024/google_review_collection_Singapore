      "text": "Today I had this curry rice for dinner and I want to give my honest review. I don't think the previous reviews I have read here about this stall are fairly written. They deserve a better rating. It's a hawker stall and the price and portions are fairly priced, everything are more expensive these days due to inflation. I am also happy with the food server's attitude and was given a free bowl of soup with vegetables as well. Personally I will visit and eat from this stall again in the future.",

Price? $50 note with no change.\n\nUpon return to clarify price, they then said it's $42 and returned $8.\n\n$10 for chicken, $10 for pork, but did not elaborate on how they calculated the balance 3 vegetables and 4 plain rice for $22 despite repeatedly asking them for it. They kept insisting price is right without giving the breakdown and said \"it's like this, there's a queue behind, don't waste their time.\"\n\nEat at your own wallet's peril.",

When I showed to them, they said ohhh ohh, not even apologising, while I’m awkwardly standing there, only then they offer to change a new one… but that’s not really the point… please improve food handling quality….\n\nTbh, first impression was not the best as the thickness of the cutlet is freaking thin, thinner than the batter… was eating more flour than meat…",
