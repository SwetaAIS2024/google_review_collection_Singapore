Charis,5,This dental clinic is AMAZING. I wished I found out about it earlier. One of the rare clinics which open at night. I brought my friend there for an emergency tooth ache without an appt and they were so nice. Dr Benn Chua is so patient and clear with his instructions and advice. I like how he does not push you to make decisions you are uncomfortable with on the spot. Highly recommend anyone to check this clinic out. Fees are very reasonable too!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114600726145980904216/reviews

Amenda Chua,5,"As a parent of a 2 year old, I was really concern how he would respond to his first dental visit. However, the visit to Toothtown just eased my mind. Dr Nicole is an incredible dentist, who was able to engage my child in conversation and ease him to the whole consultation. She was really patient and gentle, which we really appreciate for our child.

For parents, she was very detailed and patient to answer all the questions we had. She also walked us through the type of toothbrush and toothpaste we should be using. It has been very informative for us!

This is the first dental clinic we visit for our child and we know that we will frequent this place for the future!

Thank you Dr Nicole and all the wonderful staff who make the experience so smooth for our 2 year old boy! ❤️",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115260412102427642576/reviews
Nicolai Goeke,5,"Really fantastic team of dentists. Got a broken filling at 1am and was able to WhatsApp with them in the middle of the night for a next-day appointment. Immediate, thorough and completely comfortable treatment. Next, my 5 yo fell and hurt his teeth - again they somehow found us a slot and gave him a super clear diagnosis and gentle treatment. He loved it and wants to come back asap (maybe the fancy sunglasses and kids’ video of his choosing above the seat also helped... 😂) They don’t overtreat beyond what’s needed and advise carefully on sensible options, so I also end up with markedly lower cost than I was expecting every time. Super attentive, careful and kind. Every time we pass now the kids are asking when we can go again! 😂",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109605196455534119881/reviews
Alecander Ong,5,"TLDR; Bring your whole family here!

I've always been apprehensive whenever it comes to trying out a new dental clinic/ dentists in general because of how different Doctors work and operate in their own practice. But coming to Tooth Town for a consult + wisdom tooth & a normal extraction at 11pm was something I was pleasantly surprised last night!

For starters, the clinic opens till 2am! It's one thing for normal GPs to be open till late, but dentists? How rare! Dr Benn and Dr Nicole were both exceptionally mindful of the entire process from pre-consult to post-op care and I must say the jitters of being at a dentist were practically non-existent by the time I left! Additionally, they took time to explain each and every procedure, what they were gonna be doing, what they were doing and other medically-viable alternatives - just so I had one more choice. It also helped alot that they catered for sufficient rest time in between cleaning > tooth extraction and other miscellaneous items!

Being someone that reads the Google Reviews of every new place I try, I can definitely say (in my opinion) that the reviews speak for themselves to be actual facts! Super caring, super thoughtful and vibed well too. Definitely believe your fam & kids will be in safe hands ~",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110240008477515278873/reviews
