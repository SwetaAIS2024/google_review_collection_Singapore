Shania Quek,5,"My experience at the Centre has been nothing short of amazing. Not only are the teachers patient and kind towards the kids, they are beyond competent to teach any level or students. Ever since I joined the Centre when I was P5, my scores in Chinese language examinations have improved tremendously. I went from failing Higher Chinese Language to getting the Higher Chinese Language Subject Prize this year (one year later). The admin there is really nice too. He never fails to encourage kids or all ages and that was definitely one of the factors that helped me to continue improving. In all, I highly recommend sending your kids there to learn .",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111850750696198009213/reviews
