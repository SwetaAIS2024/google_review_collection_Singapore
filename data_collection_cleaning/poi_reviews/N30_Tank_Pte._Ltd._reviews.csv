Adrian Lo,5,Bought a 5 feet tank with sump from them. Service was exceptional. They forgot my filter media and broke the glass for the tank cover while transporting. Was quick to replace it and brought the media and glass the next day. The installers were very experienced and professional. No pushing for reviews unlike other companies that skew reviews in their favor.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111762008481701761072/reviews

E .C,5,"N30 tanks was recommended to me through my uncle. Mr Neo is very patient, responsive and friendly. He came to our place, measured every single corner so the tanks would fit well. With his experience, he gave good advise and explained all in details. Price is reasonable and my family are very satisfied when the tank was delivered. Outstanding tank & service!
Highly recommended!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105282069790018720487/reviews
Gurjeet Mark S,5,"I've bought several customized tanks from N30 over the years. These have been 5 foot to 6 feet including sump and cabinet. I've always been happy with the workmanship--including the cabinetry. It's best to email them first and then go down with some planning, eg position of tank, dimensions, can it fit through your door? etc. N30's always been attentive but I don't expect a first time aquarium keeper's education from them. My tank is still with me. I've even engaged them for heavy duty shelving to store 8 x 2ft plywood sheets--including with rollers--heavy duty stuff. They're a good choice for customized tanks.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117711179514719914946/reviews
