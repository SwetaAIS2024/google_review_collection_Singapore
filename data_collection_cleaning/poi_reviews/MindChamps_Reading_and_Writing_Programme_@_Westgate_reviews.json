      "text": "I am satisfied how MindChamps helps my child develop his writing skills. He started attending sessions at the age of 6. The management introduce to us their curriculum which we are really impressed because it is inclined with MOE English curriculum standards. Their Writing Tool Box is effective because we can see how our son improves his writing composition. His passion in English writing grows fonder with the help of his teachers at MindChamps and I am running out of words to thank them for their effort.",
