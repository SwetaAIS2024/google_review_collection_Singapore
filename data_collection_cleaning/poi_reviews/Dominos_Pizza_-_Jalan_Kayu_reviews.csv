K T,1,Ordered and pick up on time however pizza is cold when I pick up at appointed time. Wonder if it was cooked way in advance. Next. The pizza taste horrible and dry. Ordered the new year promo and all 4 pizza taste horrible cold and hard. Cinnamon bread was cold and hard.  spoilt our new year celebration becus of your lousy food. It's indeed a shame as my past dinning experience with Domino Australia was good. üò≠. Decided to give your pizza a pass from now onwards üçï,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108216393212508235795/reviews
lup seng Chan,1,"Ordered 2 pizzas, both not sliced. 1 got hole.

Offered voucher as compensation.

Order another day in advance with above voucher, Order not delivered.

Branch say never recieve order, can only do refund.

Turns out order was cancelled (no reason was given), but I was not informed.

In the end, I got no pizza and no vouchers.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113697670876645803439/reviews
xin,2,"Don't order Domino from foodpanda because the delivery is not only slow but your food will also go missing. I haven't tried Grab Domino but I guess I will choose pickup next time if I have the time to go pickup.

If my calls wasn't pickup by the worker in Jalan Kayu, I will only suffer because I think foodpanda has some issue with its system where I couldn't report missing items even though the indicated delivered.

Thank you for recovery order of my food and delivered to my house. Also, thanks for the giving me extra pizza for my lost. I was so glad that worker in Jalan Kayu finally answered my call after 10 calls. Thank you so much! I felt much better.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118430895719412364348/reviews
Beverly Seet,1,"Was planning a Pizza Party with my family.. Hence scheduled my order at 1pm to be delivered at 6pm. But the Pizzas only end up arriving at 7.30pm and become cold by then.. . When I call to ask about where is my late order , nobody pick up even after calling 5 times. Hard to recommend.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109944969183891927405/reviews
darren pang,1,"A really bad experience ordering Domino's for dinner. First, the chicken kickers smell rotten or spoiled. The texture of the  meat was soft and slimy... Didn't want to risk food poisoning so threw it away.

Next, the pizza boxes did not have those little plastic supports so the top of the boxes collapsed onto the pizzas. The pepperoni pizza dough was undercooked in some parts and I can taste the raw dough.

Finally the cheese bowl-cano, errr.... cheese ""platter""...  Tasted like really cheap processed cheese from a can.

Only good thing was the speedy delivery and got our pizzas within the hour.

70 dollars for this quality,  adios Domino's!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110397669507892302553/reviews
