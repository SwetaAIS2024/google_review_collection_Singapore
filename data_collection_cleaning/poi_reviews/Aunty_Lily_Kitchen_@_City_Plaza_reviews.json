The chicken was crispy and tasty too.\nThe Ayam Penyet was delicious, and the Tahu Goreng was very nice. Aunty Lily was very friendly, and even gave us a small bowl of Soto Ayam soup to try. If you're around the area, do drop by. But be prepared to queue as it's a popular stall!",

Ended up ordering the Gado Gado $5.50 gravy was so good, lots of veg and fresh.  Auntie Lily is so friendly. Ordered another Nasi Liwet with Chicken  - so so good also.  We tasted the Belinjo - tasted to good too except anit too sweet for me but we still bought home 2 big tubs (each $18) coz too nice ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…. Have to come back to try other dishes and the otah, soto ayamâ€¦.",
