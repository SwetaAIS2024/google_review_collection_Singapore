Vince Lai,3,Installed outdoor blinds about 6 years ago. We have gotten it repaired for more than 3 times. We paid for the repairs and was told that the strong wind at my home is the cause of the string dislodging from the screws. When asked how to prevent more repairs. Was told no way. The guard rail metal strings have dislodged yet again. The blinds flap wildly. It is only a matter of time the whole piece collapsed. It happened before. Luckily it did not fall out of the window and hit anyone downstairs when it happened.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101991009389382318759/reviews
Pringles,1,"Wanted to get sliding mosquitoe screens/blinds.

Sent an email on their contact form.

Company first said that it couldn't find my email which I sent on their website.

Received no reply, so I followed up and called myself.

The women answered not with the business name but with yes?

Explained the situation what I wanted only to get sorry don't have this product, even though it clearly states it on their website. Then she gave me a phone number to call.

Called the number and received a yes phone answer (must be company policy not to answer a business phone properly) . I asked for an on-site quotation and the guy asked me if I measured out my windows yet!

When I said that I wasn't taking any risks because he might add additional costs, he just laughed like he was expecting to do business like this.

If you are interested look elsewhere, we found a good company in LeGate.

This company isn't serious for business and shouldn't be worth the risk.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109113139845675599124/reviews
VICTOR TANCR,1,"Spoke to the owner Niko on 3 occasions over 1 year. Each time he said his product would be ready soon, but he would never get back. The wait was agonising and I half believed he’s taking me for a ride. I think this qualifies enough to call him a liar and dishonest.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105830283135451049889/reviews
