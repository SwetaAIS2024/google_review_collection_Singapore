Though price is still slightly higher than in the market, but given the location, i’m ok paying for it, which is alternative to paying for transport.\n\nTiktok: SA Soln\nIG: sgfood13",

It was sour!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhy are you serving bean curd that has gone sour??!!!  Don't tell me it is a special bean curd. Don't tell me that it is mixed with pickles. Don't tell me that 40mins of traveling time made the bean curd sour!  I can clearly differentiate what is the sourness and smell coming from inside the bean curd as compared to pickle sauce.\n\nMany months ago when you first started operations at Jurong Point, I was very happy. Food was great, portions were good. Crowd was good.... But look at you now........ My gosh.....  Your outlet is now so quiet.... Quality deteriorated. Value-for-money not anymore.\n\nI sincerely hope the boss of this franchise is looking after the business well and is looking into operations and quality well. It seems on the ground (kitchen), things are not well!!",
