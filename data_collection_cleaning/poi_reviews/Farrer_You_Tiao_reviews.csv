Travel With Jack Chee,5,"Did you know this stall is featured in a Michelin Guide article as one of the best places to get your dough fritters in Singapore?

Handmade dough fritter is a rare find in hawker centres these days. This local snack is delicious and affordable which makes it a great companion to savour with a hot beverage.

This elderly couple has been selling freshly made youtiao (油条), butterfly fritters (蝴蝶煎) and ham chim peng (咸煎饼) here for many years. All items cost SG1 each. Whenever I am in this food centre, I will buy their butterfly fritters AKA bei hei ji or horseshoe fritters. It is crunchy on the outside, yet chewy in the middle and offers the right sweetness.

Tip: I recommend buying the snacks when they newly fried as this is the best moment to savour its hot and fresh dough texture.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113016090208525039802/reviews
Sandra C,5,"The best place in Singapore for fried dough - butterfly, you tiao and hum ji peng all for $1 each! The butterfly is a must try - it has a crunchy and tasty exterior with the right balance of the taste of sesame, and a fluffy interior.

None of the products are too oily and they also do not have the old oil taste that some places who reuse their oil have. Stall is run by a very friendly uncle and auntie! Only downside is that the stall only accepts cash payment, so rmb to bring your wallet!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102476879267533638532/reviews
Victoria Martin,5,"Don’t know why this place isn’t more well known. I’m sure saying something is the “best” can be very controversial but the dough here really is, let’s say, really one of the best in Singapore. The dough itself is flavorful - butterfly being my favorite (good crunch on the outside from sesame on the outside), followed by the good ole you tiao. And the auntie taking orders is so cheerful she’s adorable! The elderly uncle is working so hard in the background. I always leave there with a big plastic bag of fried dough and a smile on my face.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103026680623602309072/reviews
W.M. LIEW,4,"If you are into freshly made you char kuey and ham chin bang... 😊 Then this is the place you definitely need to consider. Seriously, this traditional SG breakfast food is at its very best when it's freshly made in the morning. Accompany it with a nice cup hot and fresh kopi, it's just simply stupendous! ☕👍😘",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108054733791350792229/reviews
Joe Stroffolino,5,"Love this place, the youtiao are always fresh and hot. But not always open, it's a gamble if you catch them.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101334283107297969567/reviews
