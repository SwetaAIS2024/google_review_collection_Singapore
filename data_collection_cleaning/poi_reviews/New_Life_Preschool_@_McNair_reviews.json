My son has developmental delays, and he started K2 here. At first, he couldn‚Äôt understand English at all, but now he can read simple picture books and recognize some Chinese characters. Additionally, a special education teacher comes every month to help.",

      "text": "In the beginning, we were apprehensive about sending my kids to school (18m old at that time). However, our worry proved to be unfounded. Their playgroup teachers have demonstrated professionalism right from the start, offering positiveness, kindness and have been very easy to communicate with them. My kids settled in quickly which was a clear sign to us. That said, their teachers are also equipped with excellent teaching capabilities, evidenced by our observation of vast improvement in my kids English and Mandarin vocabularies as well as social skills. Love this school üòç",

      "text": "My kid spent 5 years in YWCA McNair from PG to K2. It's a cozy preschool with kind teachers. The facilities are great yet the school fee is low. They don't have fancy programmes but the teachers made a lot of efforts on my child's development in terms of motor skills, language & literacy and personality. He did many creative art & craft independently at home using the skills learned from school. The kids in his class are all kind and friendly to each other, and they love to play together after school. Love YWCA McNair.",
