Victoria Ho,4,"Six Avenue Porky Prawn Noodle is a must-visit for lovers of rich, porky prawn mee loaded with premium ingredients. Their signature broth is simmered for up to 14 hours, starting with freshly fried prawn heads to create a deeply umami, full-bodied base.

Choose from a variety of hearty bowls—including their signature & limited edition Noodle bowls, each in a combination of fresh prawns, prawn paste cake, pork ribs, pig tail, pig skin, liver, kidney, intestines, and more. Whether you like it dry or soup-based, each bowl is a flavour bomb. Their dry version is another crowd favourite, so tasty with their addictive sauces & house-made chilli.

With fresh ingredients and unlimited broth refills, it’s no surprise queues form early—so go hungry and go early!

Highly recommended for a good bowl of prawn noodles!

Randomstuffsg,5,"If you enjoy a hearty, pork-filled prawn mee, Sixth Avenue Porky Prawn Noodle is definitely worth checking out.

We tried their Superior 12 Porky Prawn Noodle, and it was packed with an amazing variety of ingredients — prawns, prawn paste, spare ribs, pork slices, pork tail, pork skin, heart, liver, kidney, intestines, and bean sprouts. We went with the dry version and had it tsukemen-style, dipping the noodles into a rich, flavorful broth that’s been simmering for 14 hours. It was incredibly satisfying!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116551745132589748453/reviews
Gracia Gan,5,"Soup was flavorful, and GAO enough to be called a prawn noodle soup! Very generous with their portions - I got the $6 special prawn noodle and it has 2 full prawns (not those halved kind), good amount of pork, 1 cube of prawn paste and 1 lil cute shrimp (I thought it was an accident to have it in there but turns out my mom has it in hers too!)
All in all, a good, satisfying and value-for-money meal!

They're part of the Sixth Avenue Porky prawn noodles chain, btw.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288268016184720793/reviews
Jen Teo,5,"Tried their Signature Prawn Noodles, and it comes with big and fresh prawns, slice pork, big crunchy bean sprouts and prawn paste, that’s soaked in gao gao prawn umami broth. Apart from choice of pork ribs or pig tail, they even have the mixed pork meat which comes with pig intestines, liver, kidney and skin.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108900272532096839798/reviews
Celine Lim,5,"We are happy that this is located near our home and are in love with the rich and savory prawn broth. There are generous amount of noodles and ingredients in each bowl. We like that they have mixtures of other ingredients, quite a few choices to chose from such as liver, kidney and etcs. Great for a hearty and affordable meal!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109269510378788477117/reviews
