      "text": "I am absolutely appalled by the horrendous attitude displayed by the big-sized female security guard at the French Embassy. It is completely unacceptable to receive such deplorable treatment from a frontline worker, especially considering she is the first representative of the French Embassy. The management of the French Embassy needs to take immediate action and educate their staff on how to speak courteously and with a gracious attitude. Such behavior ruins people's moods and cannot be tolerated!",

I hope embassy of the France will look into this mater and taught them more about professionalism. I love their place mostly because of located just opposite of Singapore botanic garden.\n\nFew tips :\n1. Don’t come early since they won’t allow you to enter inside until your appointment time comes.\n2. BOTANIC GARDEN MRT just opposite, if you have plenty time then you can use MRT.\n3. Only service seeker person will allow to enter inside.",

Yes, even if we need to wait, it would be polite if she could at least tell us and not make us stand outside the embassy. When you are in the security area, she will give instructions in a rude tone, as if she is ordering you to do something.",
