Victor Ng,3,"Good variety of dishes that are decent tasting. But the lady seller can be grumpy and unpleasant at times.

Her shop has the CDC voucher sign displayed. When I asked to pay by CDC voucher she screamed at me saying in the morning she
is always busy cooking and has no time for this payment mode and why didn’t I ask her beforehand?

I told her it was not a problem I would go get cash from my car and return in 5 mins. She answered “Who knows if you will return”?

I also heard her scolding the customer before me who requested for bee hoon - “can’t you see we are selling rice”?

On another occasion someone commented that her squid was expensive and she flew into a rage.

So just buy your food, talk less and leave. 😜",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115343125507441223772/reviews
