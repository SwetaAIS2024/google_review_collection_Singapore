After 7 PM, they let us in, and the experience was nice overall. However, there wasn‚Äôt anything particularly special about this movie theater it was just okay. A decent choice for a casual movie night.",

Shoutout to the cleaners also who work so hard after every show, let‚Äôs make things easier for them by binning our own rubbish. The pictures and audio in each cinema are great too. Always a wonderful experience, thanks! üôèüèª",
