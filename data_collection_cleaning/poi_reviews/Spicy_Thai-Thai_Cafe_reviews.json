      "text": "Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe in Bedok presents a mix of flavors and influences, blending elements of Chinese Sichuan, Dongbei (Northern-East chinese), Putien, and Thai cuisines. This variety offers a unique dining experience, though the lack of clear demarcation between cuisines leaves the restaurant feeling ‚Äúneither here nor there.‚Äù The atmosphere is relaxed with a Southeast Asian or Thai vibe, which aligns nicely with its name, but the menu‚Äôs layout feels more aligned with a Chinese restaurant, and the Thai options are somewhat limited.\n\nDespite these identity nuances, the dishes themselves are delicious. Portions are reasonably sized, making it easy to share and sample a variety of flavors. The food is nicely prepared, and every dish we tried was satisfying in taste.\n\nOverall, while the setup may not appeal to those looking specifically for an authentic Thai experience, Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe can be enjoyed as a Chinese restaurant at heart, with authentic Asian cuisine as a supplemental touch.",

The weather that day enhanced our experience too!\n\nFor a hawker like this, the prices were very reasonable.",
