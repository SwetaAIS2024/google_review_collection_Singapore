Ash sayhello,1,Absolutely horrendous! Came here once on the 26 April 2024 for some training with some others and we were constantly stopped during the process of training by 1 rude indian uncle due to this not allowed and that not allowed but yeah I understand but can atleast talk properly? He was demanding us to do things wasting our time at a very rude tone and at the end of our training we were dismissed and each individuals were leaving and he stopped not only me and 2 other friends but also my coach making absolutely pathetic reasons to blame us. We claim that the previous players left the shutters there and he claims that it's ours and all the litter is ours and this time was with another indian uncle who talked in a tone like him! The rude uncle even pulled out my coach to speak with him and distrupts our training. Many others have left a review about this rude uncle and no changes were made.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110022580332110303346/reviews

Nari Lulla,4,"Easy movement and very clean. Reading space with newspapers and magazines well organised. Lots of facilities like karaoke room, training rooms, badminton and squash. Also a well patronized basketball court. Just ask permission and join either side team.. Just walk in to the office and be served better then how a VIP feels.

Pick up facility forms and print advertisements for events in forecast.
Everything here except meals and comfort seating sofas like at the library.

The entrance is clean and greenery and flowers are well maintained. Gate opens at 9.00 am, closes when you leave!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108409611324483628975/reviews
Fantastic Deal,2,"Compared to those that I have been, this one is rather quiet, with not much activities. Only badminton coaching was in progress at the hall. The cooking class was right at the end of the building. There is no directional sign or staff around to assist.
The back of the building is lined with pigeons and their droppings, on the floor and wall! The supervisor must be a pigeons' lover!
Customers have to ring the bell a few times before staff, looking lethargic and irritated, appeared from behind the office, hugging their sweaters because of the cold!
Compared to the present day service, what happened ðŸ¤”to our excellent customer service of yesteryears? Retired with the older generation? ðŸ˜Š",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100447361435532923056/reviews
