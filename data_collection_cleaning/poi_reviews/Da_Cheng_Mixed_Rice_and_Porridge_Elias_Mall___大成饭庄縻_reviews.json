Bought one packet of rice with fried pig liver, tofu with minced meat and sambal squid.\nThe pig liver is very tasty and not over cooked. It also does not have the powdery after taste which I dislike. It is as good as it gets at a chai fun stall.\nThe tofu is cooked in a savoury sauce with minced meat. Taste good.\nThe sambal sauce for the squid is very fragrant and not too spicy. The squid is soft and nice. Total price of $5.50 which is very reasonable.\nThis is one of the best chai fun stall. Will be back to try other dishes.\n\nUpdate 27 June 2023 - New photo\nAte here today. 4 dishes for $6.50. Delicious!",
