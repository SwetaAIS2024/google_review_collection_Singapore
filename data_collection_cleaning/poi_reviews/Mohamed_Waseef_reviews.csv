WY L,1,Very disappointed! They charged SGD 7 for Maggie mee goreng !!! Is basically plain Maggie mee goreng with few pieces of chicken meat that is utterly tasteless. And a teaspoon of ketchup and one slice cucumber!  I think this person anyhow inflate the price! Please check the menu and pricing before ordering. Apparently it happened more than once already!! Felt so cheated !! SGD 7!! For a lousy plate of Maggie mee goreng !!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101969586849203243240/reviews
Rajen Arasu,3,"Just opened replacing Alina's Kitchen. Definite improvement from the former operator. Was informed that 24/7 operations would commence soon.   Offering a good variety of Indian food. Quality of food  to be determined.

Updated 7th July 2023. So far tried the following:
Thosai / Vadai  - Mediocre, smaller than usual Vadai

Prata - Mediocre with watery curry dip

Mee / Bee hoon Goreng - Mediocre

Overall - would rather walk 100m to Blk 158 (Al Vajeha Restaurant). Same prices and menu but better quantity and quality of food.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113317460774650179369/reviews

Kai Wee Toh,5,"I prefer this eatery over Al Vajeha on the other side of the road. The overall vibes make me feel more comfortable.

I ordered mutton briyani with additional veggie, which was satisfying, and not as salty as Al Vajeha. The amount of mutton was also fairly generous. The curry in the small bowl tasted like dhal but I was surprised to find a small piece of mutton on rib bone in it. The briyani with additional veggie cost $8. It also came with a hard-boiled egg, onion salad and a crispy pappadum.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114038700418549783797/reviews
Malcom Neo,4,Average neighbourhood indian stall. Slightly pricey but good service as friendly staff is prompt in allocating seats and menu and Takeaway noodles and soup are seperated. Stall is 24/7 so good supper place,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103408820420094292372/reviews
