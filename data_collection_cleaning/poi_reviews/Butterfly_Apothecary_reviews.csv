Huisi Chen,5,"Searching n trying on different skin care has been always a small problem to me til I discover Butterfly Apothecary skinny care products on TikTok live one day.

I see how the founder Ms Norah explain n also sharing her products n every products she try it on her own before she start sharing n selling. So I decided to get the basic Placenta spray, royal cream and dragon blood to try.

For Placenta spray it really is a toner with a purpose cos I have combination skin n normally some days my skin will peel n dry. It does help to hydrate my skin.

When I use Royal cream with Placenta spray it help to ease the peel pain n royal cream help me with Abit of coverage when going out .

I must say the product that amaze me most is the dragon blood cos the peelin during make me uncomfortable..so for 3 nights I put thick layer before I go to bed. The peeling session of my face heal 90 percent after that.

Now I'm testing on the eye cream on my panda eyes ..will update the result with all :)

I wanna give a big shout out to the admin who has been replying to my message cos when I was having a bad peeling on my face, I not too sure if I can carry on using the product. She guide me patiently over the tt message without fail:)

Thank you Butterfly Apothecary , Norah for the great products:)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117653674815507661377/reviews
