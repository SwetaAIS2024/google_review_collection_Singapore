      "text": "Authentic Mexican street tacos are antithetical to Singaporean economics.  Everything here has to be bigger and better if only to justify the necessary expense.\n\nThat being said, the food here is quite delicious.  Start with their corn chips and 3 dips.  The tortilla chips are pleasantly crispy and light with a respectable saltiness.  Delicious enough to eat on their own.  But you get three dips.  I asked for the spiciest options, and was convinced to substitute one of them for guacamole - a decision I don't regret.  The waitress recommended the salsa verde and something else, which turned out to be a Velveeta-esque cheese dip that was oddly sweet, but which did end with a little bit of heat.  The salsa verde also had a bit of heat but it was quite mild.  Perhaps feeling bad for me, she brought me a ghost pepper bottled hot sauce which had more than enough heat.  Way more.  But I appreciated the effort!  The guacamole was very respectable, with a pleasant layer of cilantro leaves over the top.\n\nI opted for their barramundi tacos, which are served in pairs, and had mine with soft tortillas instead of hard shells.  The fish was grilled or broiled and seasoned perfectly.  This was atop a massive bed of pickled cabbage.  As someone who prefers a simpler, drier taco this was overkill.  But it was really good.\n\nPair this with a cocktail.  Their selection of tequilas was much more limited than I had hoped, but they had Don Julio as well as Patron.  I opted for the Don Julio upgrade for my tequila sunrise and I was not disappointed.  Good proportion of OJ and tequila to grenadine resulting in a refreshing experience.  They also have beer and wine and other spirits, plus sodas and non-alcoholic options.\n\nOther menu options ran the gamut of fusion experiments to more traditional Mexican-y fare.  I'd definitely be willing to go back and check out other options on future visits.  Sit outside if you like to people watch.  Or face the big-screen TV if you want to keep track of the game.",

They had Happy hour for sangria....we were expecting that they would pour from an overnight pitcher but seemed that the bar tender mixed some ginger ale & fruits and made some concoction that was truly abysmal. I didn't even take a pic of the damn drink!!\nHopefully the food is better...till the next visit or maybe not!",
