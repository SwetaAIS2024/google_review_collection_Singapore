      "text": "I've shot many outdoor wedding sessions here and it never fails to deliver. This location is incredibly rich with compositional possibilities and different backdrops. The rocket tower itself is obvious, however there's also a hidden road that goes into the dense canopy behind the tower that is equally good for photos in my opinion. Sunset here is gorgeous and you get a combination of greenery, architecture, sky and water. What more could a photographer (or couple) ask for :)",

      "text": "This 18 metre tower with a circular stairway which leads to a observation platform at the top, is an iconic landmark of the area, and here are some fun facts about it:\n\nThe tower was completed in 1969, which was the same year that humans first landed on the moon. The rocket design reflects the excitement of that era.\n\nThe tower was officially opened by Princess Alexandra of Great Britain on 10 August 1969, along with Upper Seletar Reservoir.\n\nI personally love the design of the tower because of the nostalgia of the Space Age era it brings to me.",

Still able to see the lake at night and the overview of this area on top of the rocket tower. The rocket tower is about a 2 to 3 minutes climb up (about 5 to 6 stories). Star gazing might be possible on top of the tower but due to the white light on the tower roof, might interfere with what you see.",
