      "text": "I have tried Eureka popcorn before, and was planning to buy them as Christmas gifts for colleagues.\n\nI visited Eureka Plaza Singapura on Sunday 10 December 2023, about 4:15PM. I would like to commend Sandy and her colleague (I cannot remember her name). I have always only liked the caramel flavour, but they were patient and enthusiastic about introducing me to the other flavours. Although I ended up only purchasing caramel flavour (again!), the vibe was friendly and I did not feel pressured at all.\n\nGood service ethics.",

The promoter is very rude!\n\" You are Malaysian, but never eat our popcorn before\"?\n\" You don't look like Singaporean\"\n\"if you buy \" cheap\" item, you can't use voucher, only buy \" expensive item can use\". The term and condition of the Lazada voucher did not stated so!!! At the end, I walked away without buying anything. The management should really do something. All the review here is complaining the promoter.",
