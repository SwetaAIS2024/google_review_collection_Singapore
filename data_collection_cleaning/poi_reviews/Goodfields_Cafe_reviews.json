      "text": "Popped by for a light lunch and absolutely loved it! Tried the avocado toast and grilled cheese toastie - both were spot on. The avocado was fresh, creamy, and well-balanced with the feta and balsamic, while the toastie came with a comforting tomato soup that made it feel like a warm hug.\n\nCoffee was excellent. One of the best in the area.\n\nThe space itself is cozy and calm, with a relaxed vibe that’s perfect for catching up with friends or just enjoying some quiet time. Staff were friendly and attentive.\n\nDefinitely one of those hidden gems you want to keep coming back to. Can’t wait to try more from the menu!",

Paired it with their awesome homemade brownie, which was rich, fudgy, not overly sweet and just the right amount of indulgent.\n\nMy boy is always very picky but he finished the whole plate of beef ragu pasta!\n\nThe space is cozy and inviting, perfect for a chill afternoon. Friendly service and good vibes all around.",

Food are very affordable and generous. would definitely recommend tonkatsu, coffee and apple crumble. Quite ulu to get by if your not staying nearby but definitely worth the trip down.",
