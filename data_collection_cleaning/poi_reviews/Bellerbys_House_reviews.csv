是无名,5,"It's a great gem find! Nestled in back of Dempsey,  very near to the museum of ice cream.

Nice cosy place.  Nearby have pilates, dance studio for children.  A few seats outside.  Would have wanted a seat outdoor but were all occupied.  It's simple but nice place.

There's car park space and also clean nice toilets nearby.  There's also shuttle bus to this place.

It's a great find.  Didn't have a Chance to have coffee this time but will try at my return! Had tea.

Limited food choices,  so don't think would be a choice for me for lunch, more for a coffee,  snack,  break time place.

Price wise,  definitely not a coffee shop range but would say it's reasonable for the location.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105456352515293598037/reviews
Keziah L,5,"Visited on 16 December 2023, at opening time.

This cosy place is situated in Dempsey. They have a small menu of food but a wide array of smoothies to choose from. Ordered the kaya toast and muesli this time. The bread was toasty and there was a good even spread of kaya and butter throughout the bread.

This muesli was cold but good as well. I like that you can customize the toppings to your muesli.

Overall, a very nice chill place to come to!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107928213010067287766/reviews
W,5,"I can't thank the staffs at this café enough for their exceptional customer service! From accommodating me and my baby with warmth and kindness to serving up delicious food and drinks, every visit here has been a delight. The prices are reasonable, especially given its prime location in Dempsey. The serene atmosphere, surrounded by boutique gyms, adds to the charm. Plus, the convenience of a shuttle bus stop right outside makes it even more appealing. Highly recommend this gem of a café!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114979136776377065177/reviews
Peter Kakulas,5,A great find! Good coffee and food. We had the lunch time special of the day ...smoked salmon and avocado with a coffee included.  The cafe is set in an area of Dempsey which is now all refreshed. Will come back for more good coffee.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109675022890029030682/reviews
Sisca L,5,"Stumbled upon this cosy cafe somewhere in Dempsey and decided to try its coffee. Had the Iced Pandan Latte, which was made using their homemade pandan. It is not too sweet which I really loved. They have basic pastries as well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110039034576983751535/reviews
