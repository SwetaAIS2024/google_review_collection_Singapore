The taste is consistently good, and the portion size is satisfying for the priceâ€”always leaves me feeling full.\n\nThe fries sometimes come in different cuts (which I actually like), but I often have to wait a long time for my food, occasionally getting it only after my friends have finished theirs ðŸ¥².\n\nThe place is quite accessible, 24hrs, with nearby parking and a bus stop close by.",

Mee goreng tastes lousy, one of the worse I had...\n\nDon't recommend people if they intend to have a good meal to come here.",

I preferred the dip on the most right on the plate.\n\nPlain Roti Prata came warm with a lightly crisp texture. Love that it came with 2 sauces to dip on.\n\nFried Kothu Prata was a little too much in terms of portion. I guess if youâ€™re very hungry, you can order that.\n\nOverall, pretty solid supper spot around the area. Will come back to try other items",

They were my go-to for supper after burning midnight oil at my previous job, and I once came here for 2 months consecutively every night, until the point they had memorised and processed my order before I had even sat down. I admire their work ethic for working throughout the Ramadan months, and I commend the place for its 24/7 hours. I love the Maggi Goreng and the Bandung.",

Added the paper prata which was guilty but good & crispy! I prefer it without any sauce though.\n\nGiving 4 stars for now and will review again once i try their prata & indian rojak!",
