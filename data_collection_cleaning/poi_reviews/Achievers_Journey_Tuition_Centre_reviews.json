      "text": "I’ve been attending Achievers Journey for English tuition, and I have to say, it has been a wonderful experience! Mdm Han, our teacher, is absolutely fantastic. She has a deep understanding of the subject and explains things in a way that’s easy to grasp, even the more complex concepts. What I really appreciate is how patient she is, always taking the time to ensure everyone understands before moving on. She’s also very encouraging, making the lessons feel less like a chore and more like a rewarding experience. Overall, I’ve noticed a significant improvement in my English skills, and I feel much more confident now. I highly recommend this tuition center and Mdm Han to anyone looking to improve their English!",
