Service was good, except the waiter was smoking just before he poured our glasses of water and the glasses had the smoke smell. Suggest that hands be washed before serving.",

The white asparagus was an absolute delight!\nEnjoyed their seasonal beer (can‚Äôt remember the name) and their berry bliss gin cocktail.\nService was great! The lady who took our order was a consummate professional!\nGreat setting, with 3 floors. The first one being a bustling pub and the upper two a little more formal-dining style.",

Everyone smiled and made me feel comfortable and relaxed while eating. DavidüëçüèªüëçüèªIt was a really nice place.  The portion is generous. The seasoning is just right. It's not too salty, which is nice. I didn't know that the salad came with dressing. If you don't want it, ask for it when you order. The vegetables were really fresh. My child said that the vegetables were crunchy and fresh and that they went well with sausages and meat. I was so sad that I couldn‚Äòt try a variety of dishes because I was pressed for time. Next time, I want to go and try beer too.",
