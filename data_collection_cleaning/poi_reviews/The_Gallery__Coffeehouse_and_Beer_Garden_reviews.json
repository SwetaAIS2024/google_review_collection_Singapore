      "text": "This place is tuck away at almost the end of Hillview Terrace and many people may not know it’s existence. I have patronised this place many times and I like the ambience very much as it gives a very kampung feel. Unfortunately due to teh lack of dining in customers, only two stalls are left opened and they depend on Food Delivery services to survive. The drink stall only open in the day but for the evening diners you have to self service and take the bottled drinks from the fridge.\n\nBeside the kampung ambience, I like the Thai food and the chicken wings. Delicious. Don’t expect good service, though.",

I think the auntie was already drunk in the early morning. Somemore the staffs here wear mask under chin at all time. I come here 3 times and there isn't single time the auntie and uncle able to serve item/size correctly. Avoid their drink station at all cost. The Thai food here and Bowl & Makan pretty good by the way.",
