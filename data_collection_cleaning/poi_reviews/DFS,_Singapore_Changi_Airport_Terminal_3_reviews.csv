Niger.,1,"I just arrived in Singapore and have no idea that there is a different between the DFS store before and after arrival.

When I was purchasing, the staff kept talking to one another and wasting my time. After my purchase, I asked if there was a limit to my purchase. Only then was I reminded by the staffs that this store was only for departure. So why wasn’t this brought up when he checked my boarding pass and before I actually paid.

The two staff proceeded to lament that they have to do a refund and placed the blame on me. Sylvia was trying to whisper in front of me “why he even come to this one instead of the one after arrival?” Absolutely terrible attitude and service from the staff.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110626532330282942441/reviews
