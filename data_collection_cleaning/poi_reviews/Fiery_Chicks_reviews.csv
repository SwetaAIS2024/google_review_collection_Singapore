Sm L,4,"It's juz a coffeeshop, so no comment on atmosphere. Food is always good since they opened in this coffeeshop, better than previous & nearby western food places. Their spring chicken especially, is very fresh & juicy! Recommended. Pasta also gd as my family hv tried a few types & all gd. Service wise, we are served by the young man all d time, they'r nice chaps & accept feedbacks too. It's always our first choice. üëç",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116543120526794784034/reviews
Ryan Tay,4,"Ordered chicken Cutlet for $7.90. Food was ready pretty quickly and the cutlet taste good. But the portion is a tad smaller than what I get from other Western Food stalls around Sengkang area.

Fraiche Scents,1,"Came with my wife and bought the chicken cutlet, upon paying the female cashier (not local, viet) gave me this rude attitude like I did something to offend her. I asked her whats wrong and she pretends to smile. When collecting my food, she rolled her eyes at me. Food was soso, price was expensive, highly NOT recommended with this kind of staff attitude. Ask her to go back if she is not happy to work",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107702034321998881487/reviews
