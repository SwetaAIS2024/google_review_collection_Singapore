Quing_åˆ˜å¦ˆå¦ˆ,4,"TwoLittleBread@Eco Botanic, the waffles are crispy outside and soft inside, with a great balance of texture. The portion is just right, and the flavors are well-balanced. A cozy spot for a relaxing tea break. The cafÃ© has a nice ambiance, making it a great place to unwind. Their drinks complement the waffles well, and the service is friendly. Worth a visit for a light and satisfying treat!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113415962335886718172/reviews

Loh Jansen,4,This place reminds me of another that used to be in the same area but abruptly closed. My son loves the sandwiches and waffles there. Well we have found another go to place for waffles and sandwiches. Abit of a pity they charge for filtered water though.. this unwelcome trend seems to be picking up.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107798517915450326067/reviews
