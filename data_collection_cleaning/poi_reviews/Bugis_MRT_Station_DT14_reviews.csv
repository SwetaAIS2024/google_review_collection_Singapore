Samantha Tan,5,"When you are at Tan Quee Lan Street, the stark juxtaposition of modern hi-rise architecture and traditional pre-war shophouses is very clear for all to see.

On one side, many restaurants have sprouted in the row of pre-war shophouses making it a very lively place to be in the evenings and weekends.

On the other side, construction is underway for Guocoland’s Midtown Modern and nearby Midtown Bay. These new buildings are next to Shaw Towers and are looking quite impressive before it’s even completed.

In the middle of these two sides is the Bugis MRT which is very conveniently located that once the construction is completed, you can expect that this MRT Station will bring air of foot traffic to this area for live-work-play.

If you travel along Nicoll Highway, we will see the construction going full steam ahead … even Shaw Towers jumped on the bandwagon and got itself rejuvenated so as not to pale in comparison with the sparkling Midtown buildings when it’s ready.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103326334256280105276/reviews
James Noah,1,This security guard was being very rude and started scolding people like he owns the place. I was just waiting at a corner for a friend to pass something and he started yelling saying this is not allowed. Bugis MRT station staff please advise!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111854758212751692311/reviews
EG Brothers in Singapore,2,"The toilet door lock need to fix.

I went in and while I squat down suddenly the door open on its own.

Shameful experience.

Rishal,5,"I stayed near to Bugis MRT when I was in Singapore. It was just 400 meters away from my hotel. Such a nice staff who behaves very politely and give detailed answer to our all queries. The best metro service I have seen in my entrie life and Bugis Metro station is one among the best metro station in the world.

Thank you Singapore",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112322319366908424020/reviews
Richard Loat,5,"Bugis Station is at the heart of the action. Above you have Duo Galleria which is a residences and business tower. This station which is Blue and Green Lines intersecting is above Bugis Junction which has all you can need from a shopping perspective, but also close to Hajji Lane for nightlife, Arab street for great food, and is in the Arab quarter near the Textile district so there are lots of textile merchants for all of your needs. Blu Jaz Cafe just above has good live music and there are lots of eateries near by.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102872667321698106793/reviews
