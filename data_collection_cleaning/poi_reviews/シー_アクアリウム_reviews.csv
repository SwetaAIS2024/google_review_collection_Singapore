kazam aster,5,"The largest aquarium in Southeast Asia. If you visit here, other aquariums will look poor, so that may be a shame.

It's not just a huge aquarium, it's full of wonderful and eye-catching creatures, including tiny poison dart frogs.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109917521843313832707/reviews
Kana Kama,5,"There is Asia's 1 largest aquarium. Many people sit and watch.

There are several toilets, but the one on the floor with the large water tank was kept very clean and looked like the one in a hotel.

I enjoyed being able to observe sharks from various angles in the shark tunnel.

My time there was about 3 hours, but if you take a quick look, you can probably get around in about 1 hour.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100779031301741863443/reviews
