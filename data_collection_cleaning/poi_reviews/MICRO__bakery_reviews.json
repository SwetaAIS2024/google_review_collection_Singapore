Their bread are top notch and fluffy, even my toddler enjoys their bread a lot.\n\nThe food is there is also delicious and hearty. We enjoyed the Kimchi sandwich a lot(only on weekends). Overall this is the must visit place if you are around the area, if not you will regret it.\n\nThe queue can be long, so be sure to queue and get a number.",

      "text": "Yummy tasty bakery goodness … that’s how I’d describe @microbakerykitchen off of Bukit Timah road. Sure, the Serene Center is not the sexiest location, but the baked goods here bring the sexy back! I didn’t stay here to dine in as I had this amazing homemade fig jam at home with my name on it, so I picked up a loaf of the sourdough, and because they were calling my name, a couple of lemon cranberry scones. And, since I was walking, I got an iced coffee to go.\n\nAt home, the bread toasted all up was the perfect vehicle for butter and jam. The crust was crunchy and the inside was soft with the right amount of chew. My coffee was awesome … not sure where they source the beans but it was a nice smooth iced coffee with oat milk that totally hit the spot. Later in the day I enjoyed the scone and it was flaky and sweet and tart, perfect for enjoying with a cup of tea. Can’t wait for my next walk on  Saturday to grab some more goodies from this spot",

Coffee was great, among the best i've tasted.\n\nService was efficient and commendable for thoughtfulness. We ordered at bakery inside (they have two separate shops) but tables all occupied, cashier helpfully suggested we order coffee at other outlet bcos here disposable cups but outside better cups.\n\nEnvironment is clean and nice vibes (pet friendly so plenty of furry pals)",

      "text": "I initially attempted to walk in and purchase a sourdough, only to learn that pre-orders are required two days in advance. While disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised to discover their delicious kombu butter. It's incredibly smooth and boasts a rich umami flavor.\nI later preordered a Country Sourdough ($13) and collection was a breeze. The friendly crew also offered slicing service upon request. The two-day wait is due to slow fermentation, resulting in a loaf with the perfect chewy texture and a truly distinctive aroma. Honestly, this has to be the best sourdough I've tried recently. I will definitely be returning for more.",
