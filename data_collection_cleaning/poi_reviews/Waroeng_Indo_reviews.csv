William Lu,5,"My favorite place to buy Indonesian groceries. Even though the price is a lot more expensive compared to buying at Indonesia but it is way more convenient to buy here.

It is located at level 3 lucky plaza. It accepts paynow as payment.

Very friendly store attendant, speak bahasa as well.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews

Diana Huang,5,"Recently found this place in Lucky Plaza. I am surprised to see this small store has a lot of varieties on Indonesia's food and other stuffs. To my surprise, they even sell Kecap Bango, Minyak Kayu Putih Cap Ayam and the Saltcheese biscuit.
