      "text": "Overall a good stay. Room and bathroom were clean. First day, we had issue of ants in the room and air conditioning not working. Both attended when we complaint.  However Ants were back on Day 5. Taking away half star from overall rating because of this.\n\nToiletries are very basic and not so great quality, reducing another half star for that as well.\n\nRest everything was fine. Towels and linen were clean and soft. No fridge in room but cold water available in dispenser in ground floor.\n\nLocation is good because MRT Exit B is 350 Meters away. Near this exit B, there is an Indian Store available 24x7 which sells  goods on much cheaper than any of 7-11 I tried in Singapore.\n\nLots of Indian Eateries within 600-700 meters of this hotel.  The neighborhood is silent and clean.",
