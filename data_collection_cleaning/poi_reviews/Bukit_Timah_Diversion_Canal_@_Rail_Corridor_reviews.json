      "text": "The Bukit Timah Diversion Canal along the Rail Corridor in Singapore is a historical and scenic waterway that runs parallel to the former railway tracks. It was originally constructed to divert water from the Bukit Timah area to the Singapore River. The canal and its surrounding green spaces have been integrated into the Rail Corridor development, which is part of a broader urban renewal project aimed at transforming old railway land into a vibrant recreational space.\n\nToday, it offers a peaceful setting for walking, cycling, and nature walks, with lush greenery and historical landmarks along the route. The canal provides a unique blend of history and nature, attracting both locals and tourists who are keen to explore Singaporeâ€™s heritage while enjoying outdoor activities.",

You can see the Man-made Cascading Water nearby, opposite the Holland Green Playground of the Holland Green Linear Park. You may stay longer to watch birds from the region stop by for water at the canal.\n\nNParks has done a great job of converting the old rail of Singapore into a nature corridor that is useful to all walks of life, be it nature lovers, bikers, runners, walkers and even digital influencers.",

It's the interchange of this unique man made canal which is rather picturesque and the adjoining Clementi Forest.\n\nTake a chance for a breather and enjoy the sights!\n\nNote to All!! Please continue tio keep the place clean!! Take your litter with you!! Stay on the path and not create your own path ways.... It will start to look like a construction site if you do not respect nature!! Thank you!",
