The food is tops and the sodas are not sweet either. I usually order online but visiting the outlet is certainly worth the trek if you’re in the area.",

Whoever said that vegetarian/vegan food is boring should come here!\n\nOrdered the \"Chilli Krab\" and it was absolutely juicy, delicious and packed with flavor. The Chilli crab sauce was also spot on tasty!\n\nThe service was also quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was casual and welcoming. It's a great spot for a quick and satisfying meal, whether you're vegan or just looking to try something different. I'll definitely be back to explore more of their menu! Highly recommend!",

The sauce was gingery and umami. And the cucumbers were refreshing. The tempeh chips were great too! Price is a little steep but if you’re a student, the student meal is great! Also tried the new tofu-brócoli patty",

I would say price is a little steep. But given that vegan patties are really expensive in the supermarket, guess can’t complain.",
