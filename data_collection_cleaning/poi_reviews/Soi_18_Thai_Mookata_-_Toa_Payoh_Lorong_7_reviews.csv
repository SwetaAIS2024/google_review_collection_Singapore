Stephanie Ong,5,"Great value for money with excellent service and generous portions. As others have mentioned, the garlic pork was very good. We also had the tom yum soup base (+$3) which was quite spicy but can be adjusted by diluting some clear base to suit your taste. Overall I think this is the best mookata in Toa Payoh so far!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118386790331593991852/reviews
