      "text": "Starbucks Parkland Greens, East Coast: We have cycled past this gazillion times but today we headed in the cool AC confines for a duck-out from the blistering sun. I am not a Starbucks fan as I dislike outlets but this afforded a lovely view of the blue sea and the green (hence Parkland Greens). Sit out for the sea breeze or head in for the AC blast. We chose the latter. It‚Äôs lovely to do their latest high-priced matcha mocha drink (weird blend) and strawberry blossom cheese cake. This might be one of my rare Starbucks outlet like. #eatstylishtravelstylish",

Can easily accommodate different group of people.\nThere was only one staff in the morning, when I was there. She was friendly and patient.\nOverall a nice environment to chill out- you can enjoy the sea view while you are there!\n\nOne of my favourite outlet.\nStrongly recommended!",
