Vegetarian one is 9.9 while non Veg is 11.9 which comes to 13.1 with Service Charge.\nToday's lunch had Lassi, Pani puri (4 pieces), Hot n sour soup, Papad, Chicken masala, Daal Makhni, Also Methi, Baigan ki sabzi, Chana bhindi, plain rice, Naan and Sabudana as dessert. Meal is quite sumptuous,  quality is good and service very quick. They even asked to refill the rice.\nVeg one is definitely worth it while non Veg I felt was a bit expensive.\nOverall excellent food and excellent service too.\nPS: You can add masal tea for just 1SGD as a bonus.\n14Sep2022: writing this review for their Veg Takeaway Thali. Worth the money. Comes with 3-4 dishes, Naan, Rice, Pakodas and Dessert. Mine had Palak Paneer, Aloo Gobhi, Mix Veg, Aloo pakoda, rice, naan and Payasam. All v tasty. Thali  costed SGD 8.3 and it was absolutely more than worth the money.",
