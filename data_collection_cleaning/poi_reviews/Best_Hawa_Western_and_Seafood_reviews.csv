Kacax,5,"My fav vendor in Food delivery apps. At night hungry always order from here. Not sure how many times I have order. At least once a month order from here. Tasty Malaysian style western and stir fries like Nasi Goreng, Daging masak merah etc. But my go-to is always the chicken chop with black pepper sauce, the black pepper sauce too nice.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103839386838101393779/reviews
