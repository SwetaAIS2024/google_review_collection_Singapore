      "text": "The initial dining experience was overall pleasant. Service was fast and satisfactory.\n\nI am quite familiar with its products, as we used to have it in Malaysia for a much cheaper price.\n\nTheir menu is via QR code, but ordering is through the staff, which I find quite unnecessary, so just to charge the service fee of I think above 10%.\n\nThe serving size is the same. However, we find the chocolate a little skimpy considering its price.\n\nOne thing. Chairs are a bit uncomfortable, though. Overall, it's still OK because the chocolate quality is really good.\n\nCoffee was less acidic, in my opinion, which I prefer.",

      "text": "I visited dipndip at VivoCity with my family of 5 and had a delightful dessert experience. I ordered the Fondue Indulgence, which was beautifully presented and perfect for sharing. The highlight for me was the Chocolate Fondant‚Äîrich, gooey, and paired perfectly with vanilla ice cream. I also tried a few other chocolatey treats, though I can't recall their names, each one was just as indulgent. The staff were friendly and the cozy atmosphere made it a great spot to unwind. Do keep in mind that the waiting time can be quite long, especially on weekends, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. Still, it's a must-visit for chocolate lovers! üòç",

No matter what I try, I‚Äôm always impressed with the rich, high-quality chocolate and the perfectly balanced sweetness of their desserts.\n\nThis time, we ordered the Brownies & Cookies and the Triple Chocolate Waffle. To my surprise, I absolutely loved the brownies and cookies! The texture was just right, soft, chewy and full of chocolatey goodness. Every bite was rich and satisfying, making it one of the best brownies and cookies I‚Äôve had. The Triple Chocolate Waffle was just as amazing, with a generous drizzle of delicious chocolate that melted in my mouth.\n\nThe service was great and the cozy atmosphere made the experience even better. Whether you‚Äôre here for a quick chocolate fix or a full dessert indulgence, Dip n Dip never disappoints. The variety on their menu is fantastic with so many options to satisfy any chocolate craving.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a chocolate lover, this place is a must visit! I can confidently say that Dip n Dip is one of the best dessert spot and I‚Äôll definitely be coming back for more. Can‚Äôt wait to try other items on the menu next time!",
