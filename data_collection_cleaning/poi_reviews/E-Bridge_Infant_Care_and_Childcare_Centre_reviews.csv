Mandy Thiam,1,"Staffs in the school are bounded by stringent process and protocol, communication between teachers and parents is minimal when there are issues and we werent informed due to lack of communication platform and teachers are only allowed to call parents for urgent matters during lunch time. What the centre leader, Ms Koh Sue Ai said is just that ebridge is open door policy therefore communication chat via the app is not required. “Parents can communicate to teachers via drop off and pick up”. But first, teachers will be busy checking in the kids and parents would have to rush to work early in the morning. Drop off might be other authorised person and at the end of the day, there is hardly sufficient communication between parents and teachers. In parents pov, school is not being empathetic to parents and using the name of eton house, ebridge is seeing too highly of themselves, very proud and believe they can make a difference in the young kids life. however they do not uds there are good schools which are really much better than ebridge. Too highly raved among parents which results in me having high expectations however i was utterly disappointed and totally not recommended, other AOP schools might be much better in terms of communication and procedures.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115604809116439835867/reviews
Gloria Wong,5,"I’ve placed my sons in a total of 4 schools (because we moved quite a bit in the past few years). It’s only after leaving this school that I realised how dedicated the infant care and playground teachers are. At infant care, there will only be 2 teachers who will communicate with the parent as they are the main IC. This is important as every baby have their peculiar needs and routines. Such a practice is not found in the 2 other infant cares I’ve placed my sons in. Shout out to teacher Angela who is nurturing. PG is a safe place for my son. He quickly learns the names of his teachers. They also set good routines with him. If I was still living in this area, I would never have changed school",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102908348093873686685/reviews
Perry Ng Woon Howe,5,"My 3 years old kid switched over to this E-bridge mega center from another pre-school mega center. There is a lot of plus points in their practice(s), from individual classroom in-processing to tag-based identity for guardians. It is pretty effective considering and comparing to other pre-school. The photos on the activities in school are also readily shared by the friendly teachers to the parents. I receive so many emails from my kid's classroom teachers as compared to the previous one who did not even bother to update us. It is a 5-star pre-school for me.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105502292280056391742/reviews
NASH AZIZ,1,"A poor example of for a preschool. Dont be fooled by their affiliation with Eton house. Most of the teachers are from PRC. I have nothing against them but most classes have an english teacher and a mandarin teacher, who converses with your child in mandarin. On days where the english teacher is absent or on leave, the school says that a replacement english teacher would substitute but most often than not, it is not the case. A PRC assistant would be assigned to the class so basically chinese is a first language and english becomes basically non-existant. Once again I have nothing against chinese but at least have some balance. I am a non-chinese but I am still a singaporean. Its alarming that my child have a better understanding of english than her teachers. Correspondence between you and teacher is either through the communication book or emails which mostly consist of centre closure dates and outbreaks of HFMD. My child has been there for more than a year due to proximity to my home and lack of options. After numerous feedback given to the principal and teachers that they lack the personal touch, nothing was done. Dont let me start with the admin staff, who feels that they have no need to engage with the parents who are after all, their paymasters. There are a few very nice ones, which I cling on to have positive thoughts about the school but to be honest, putting my daughter there for more than a year troubled my conscience. Visibly, there were no development in my child. I feel that my child was just another number among the hundreds there. Struggle to think of any positive things about the school. I have sinced moved and will be enrolling her to another kindergarten. If you have other options, go for others. Once again, dont be fooled with their affiliation with eton house. Just a name.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115198961326403221026/reviews
Daphnie Yew,1,Principle not open heart to receiving feedback from parents and refused to view from the point of parents. It is quite rude and unprofessional way when communicate with the parents.Preferably one way communication can't act as a neutral person.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111078924651643724306/reviews
