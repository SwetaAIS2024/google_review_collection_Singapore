Kenneth Aung,5,"They have the variety of authentic Burmese products available. The selection of snacks, sauces, and drinks was impressive. I particularly enjoyed the tea leaf salad and love drinking beers there.
The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, offering great suggestions based on my preferences. The store itself was clean and well-organized, making it easy to find what I was looking for.
Prices were reasonable for the quality, and I left feeling like I got a great deal. I highly recommend buying tea leaf salad, Sunday tea mix, Myanmar instant noodles and Bullet Beer 3 cans for $10 only. I will definitely be back!""
