+ Weekday Mass (Monday - Friday):  6.30 AM & 6.30 PM;
+ Weekday Mass (Saturday): 6.30 AM;
+ Saturday Sunset Mass: 4.00 PM;

C M,5,"A wonderful church right by MRT station and surrounded by housing estate.
The Saturday vigil was at 4 pm, the earliest I have ever heard and even then it was full house. Literally the pews on both floors were filled. It was amazing to see Saturday mass gathering such popularity.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100019447379482261801/reviews
Agnes Nguyen,5,Nice church with friendly staff. Have cantin and it open when have catechism class on Sunday. Church has a lot of activities and is very useful. It was great for parents to join parenting classes here on every kid's sunday mass afternoon. 5-7 minutes walk from Punggol interchange or mrt. Have limited parking slots. You can park at a nearby HDB ( radius 200 metres ).,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102589157344528823864/reviews
W8ll8am Gastby S8m,4,"👍👏😉Beautiful Catholic Church . The newest . 😍 Was there to attend mass. However seated at the extreme right , the sound system wasn't that good or covered enough there. Quite muffed . Can't really hear what the priest saying. However otherwise church ambient not bad but I still prefer the antique tradition type like Novena. 😉👏👍",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101069809328749995510/reviews
Mikaela Kwee,5,"The stained glass on the altar area is stunning! I also love that it depicts the Transfiguration scene which is not so commonly displayed in most churches. It is important to also remember the important roles of Prophet Elijah and Moses in the history of Salvation.

I really like that the choir chant the Communion Anthipon at the beginning of the communion time. It is so important to reflect on it as well as it builds the right solemn atmosphere for everyone receiving the Holy Communion.

The Adoration room is good, although a little bit small. It will be better if a thick curtain can be placed at the entrance before people step into the room (so after taking off the shoes) to minimise the noise from outside seeping into the adoration area.

I like that they also have a signage displaying info of the many statues around the church.

Impressed to see the uniformity of the logos of all the ministries in this church. All bear the same background but display different symbol relating to each ministry's mission.

Catholics in SG are so blessed to have another beautiful and reverent church like this one.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106774260395882483814/reviews
