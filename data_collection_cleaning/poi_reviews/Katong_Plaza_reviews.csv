Flo Yeow,2,"They have a very awkward setup against Roxy Square and all the surrounding buildings. It's a super old establishment, so don't expect too much. Mostly offices and empty shops, not a place I'd shop around in full transparency. Carpark is also simply functional, but also extremely run down.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Ng Tiow Seng,2,"It's a small commercial mall, to be re-developed soon, as it was sold collectively to a developer. There are good foods at its ground floor coffee shop or 'katong kopitiam'. Nothing much to recommend, indeed.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114417331742311110848/reviews
Tzicharpot Ski,2,"Not my favourite building because the parking gantry is manual and doesnâ€™t accept the newer cashcards, so coming in and out is always very painful - literally because I have back problems.

The building tenants itself are hugely varied. From family therapy and toy stores to satanic candle shops. Toilets are locked and the escalators are always turned off.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110441857713925968705/reviews
M Yunes,5,Very friendly and loud uncle. You will know why I say that if you have been there. I liked the black sauce wantan mee. It was good.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112677035339499270105/reviews
Pari,2,"Avoid the drinks (especially pre-made thai ice tea) at the food court. The Thai ice tea tasted strange and sour, so I went back to return it to the stall.

The store assistant couldn't speak English, and she didn't seem to understand when I told her to taste the Thai tea herself, to test whether it has gone bad.

Food hygiene seems to be poor for the drinks... I hope this helps someone to avoid a bad stomachache.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117904879712330513765/reviews
