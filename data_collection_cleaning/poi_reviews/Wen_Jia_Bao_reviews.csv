Shang Yin Xoria Meng,1,"Recalling an incident at 655am in WenJiaBao Lakeside MRT economic food stall on Sunday 24 November 2024

I queued behind a man taller and older than me. My purchase was a packet of white beehoon (kosong) which costs $1.50 and a packet of white beehoon with a piece of otah and curry vegetables in a total of $6.00 which meant my beehoon with others and vege costs $4.50.
The guy before me took long time at the cashier. So I move before him to scan my qr code for paynow.

I asked the cashier the price of my food. She told me it's $10.80. This is a shock so I asked again on what I bought? Then she question the guy who pick me food. The guy told her everything i bought is $6.00 only. But she picked the bento of a guy customer behind me and told me to move away for blocking him. I asked her what was the reason she is not serving me but someone else? She said I cut queue and blocked the way. I asked her why she had overcharge me? She brushed aside and said there are too many people and I must queue up 1st. After I paid., she said that I should get lost faster.

Terrible cashier service from a rundown profiter at WenJiaBao Lakeside MRT.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100071111006731012165/reviews
Max Leung,1,"bought chicken and tofu, $5.7?? howâ€™s that economical riceðŸ¥´ðŸ¥´after reading the reviews, looks like Iâ€™m not the only one that got scammed with their ridiculous prices.. the Chinese Mainland aunties kept on bickering with one another and they even forgotten about my order. horrendous customer service. the Nasi lemak store just round the corner is much more affordable and service was so much better.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116832467157698388905/reviews
Paul Chan,4,"This is really 2 different take out places in one.

On the L. Common ""Cai Fan"" or curry rice outlet. Good selection and pretty popular with commuters headed home.

On the R. Smaller outlet that serves an interesting selection of Northern Chinese and Shandong dishes. ShenJianBao is pretty good. Cold noodles with cucumber in a spicy sesame sauce also good. They also have a selection of other cold side dishes worthy of add-ons.

Don't expect the best service or atmosphere. This is a utilitarian take out place.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104085603801790709162/reviews

Naing Maung,1,"Disappointing experience. The staff were unfriendly, unhelpful, and spoke rudely to me. The poor customer service overshadowed the quality of the food. Improvement is needed in treating customers with respect and courtesy.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118310946269372790024/reviews
