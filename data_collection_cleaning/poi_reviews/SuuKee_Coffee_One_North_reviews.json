      "text": "Given 4 stars cos of its floss with condense milk toast. Suggest to remove it as its extremely badly done. Affect the image of suukee as I think rest of the menu are good. It’s way below average that I got no words to describe it. (Anyway, I threw it away.)\n\nSignature orh nee with butter toast is very good and yummy. Orh nee paste is very nicely done which I can say better than some dessert store orh nee paste. It’s like kaya but in yam style. Teh peng not too sweet and very fragrant. As a teh peng person, one of the best few I had and reasonable price.",

      "text": "The Orh Nee Toast is a must-try! The taro paste is smooth, lightly sweet, and pairs perfectly with the crispy, fluffy toast—best enjoyed fresh. Variations like pork floss and butter add variety, and the $6.50 set with Signature White Kopi is a great deal. The coffee is creamy and perfectly sweet, while the sous vide eggs are consistent with jammy yolks. Conveniently located by the MRT, it’s a cozy spot worth visiting if you’re nearby!",

      "text": "Really enjoyed my breakfast here! The eggs were cooked just right - that runny yolk with dark soy sauce was perfect. Their sandwiches are super satisfying - crispy on the outside, with a tasty ham and egg filling. The coffee came in these cute colorful cups and hit the spot. Yes, it’s a bit pricey for a local breakfast place, but honestly, the quality makes up for it. You can tell they put care into everything they serve. If you’re looking to treat yourself to a nice breakfast and don’t mind spending extra for quality, give it a try!",

      "text": "OG Orh nee toast was alright - would prefer a toastier toast.\n\nWent back to try their signature teh peng and the teh was good, pretty huge cup too. Also the orhnee pork floss set - chunky spread definitely recommend!\n\nBack again to try their lunch; luncheon meat / teriyaki chicken scrambled egg rice bowl. Personally find it not to my liking - rice is hard and grainy, the brown sauce that drizzle over the rice was overpowering with dark soya sauce taste.",

The taro paste is really yummy and just slightly sweet, the bread is crispy and soft.\nIt’s busy at lunchtime on a weekday, but I could get a seat. It was $3.50 for just the toast, and you can get a meal for $6.50.\nHonestly, it’s a good dessert.",
