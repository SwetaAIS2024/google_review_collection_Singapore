Rachel Wardina,1,"Worst acupuncture sessions I have ever attended in my life.

This so called professor is a joke. Zero relief, plenty of pain and he doesn't even understand my problem.

At one point, he was bending my ligament backwards and when I screamed in pain, he asked the nurses what was going on and they had to explain to him and he said ""Oh"".

Ridiculous. Utter waste of money. Avoid.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115852974374119841965/reviews
