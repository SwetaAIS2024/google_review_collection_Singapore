#janjiHalal,5,Due to January raining non-stop we shall go for spicy & heaty food to counter cold weather. Where else to Ayam Penyet President @Hillion BPJ. The juicy tender chicken blend with its devil 😈 sambal. Yum..😋 all their devil chill set you up. Their tahu telor with black sauce will sure add kick to your rice flavour. Oxtail soup for me is light smooth broth close to your heart. Couple pax less than $50 budget in the Heartland Mall.

Jia Rong Ng,1,"Food was served cold during dinner hours which is completely unacceptable. It seemed pre-prepared but wasn’t even heated properly, making it taste off from the usual standard. For the price paid, at the very least, food should be served hot. If a restaurant can’t even manage that during peak dinner hours, what should customers expect? Very disappointing.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113164625131529194147/reviews
Zamirul Muazzim,2,"I bought ayam penyet for takeaway but did not get any sambal. With that kind of price, this kind of thing should not happen.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110910314953476057424/reviews

Price increased substantially, chicken portion smaller. But taste is still good!

One of my regular dinner haunts serving authentic  Indonesian Ayam Penyet  and many other dishes and desserts.

We usually order rice (they have nasi kuning also), a portion of  ayam penyet, gado-gado and begedel. Today, we also ordered the egg omelette.

This place does a fantastic peanut sauce for the gado-gado, creamy buttery texture with that nice strong peanut aroma and lightly drizzled with black sauce.

The begedil is another amazing creation. They will fry it after u order as it is always served piping hot, hard and crispy on the outside, soft mushy and favorful on the inside.

By the way,  Perkedel, bergedel, pegedil or begedil is Indonesian fried patties, made of ground potatoes, minced meat, peeled and ground corn or tofu, or minced fish.

The egg omelette is just eggs and I believe is quite like the thai style omelette where beaten eggs are cooked im generous  amount of hot oil.

Another must try diah is tahu-telor.

You can  help yourself to the piping hot vegetable  clear soup.

Highly recommended.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106394450808200270399/reviews
Katherine Constance,5,Pleasant surprise. The grilled cat fish and fried rice were both unexpectedly tasty.  Friendly and worked quickly by the only service staff that greeted us. Will definitely come again.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101465054303291114398/reviews
