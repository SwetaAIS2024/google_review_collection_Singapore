They do have this tradition of using small plates to carve out the roasted suckling pig dish before smashing the plates on to the floor. So watch out. We ordered 2 tapas and then shared a grilled ribeye which we thought was quite good.",

Simple yet great fare that would give any restaurant in Barcelona a run for its money. Tapas are only OK, but the main courses are where the place shines. Tried the lobster rice and the signature fish dish. Both were outstanding.",

I am no expert in Spanish cuisine but definitely have had my fair share of Spanish food in the past years.\n\nFood wise, can get a little too creative and carried away with the Spanish cuisine. Been here three times and I always left hungry. Suckling piglet is overrated little piggies grilled with rosemary -- and it stank a little. Paella is not what you expect. Even the basic croquetas are a far departure from what I am used to back in Spain.",
