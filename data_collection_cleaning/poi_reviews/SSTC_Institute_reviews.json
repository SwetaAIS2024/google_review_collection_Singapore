      "text": "I spent one year learning the O-level course in SSTC. All the teachers here are incredibly responsible for studentsâ€™ development. They are kind and their classes are filled with wonderful teaching and attractive contents. The staff will try hard to meet studentsâ€™ needs like competition registrations and any testimonial needed by students. The year I studied here is also fulfilling as abundant of interesting activities held by the school. The facilities here are also wonderful. The school has a nicely equipped laboratory to support studentsâ€™ science practical exams. Within the year, all my subjects levels were improved a lot and I got unexpected grades for the final exam. I appreciate the teachers and students I encountered here, as well as the schoolâ€™s responsibility and support given to us.",

      "text": "This should be proof enough that the owner takes months to reply. Guess it's better than being dismissive or getting verbally abused. Transparency is a laugh when the owner keeps lying about why the salary is not paid. Raising such issues is the equivalent of disloyalty in the owner's eyes.\n\nStudents don't really get what they signed up for. Classes are combined often because of business or cost cutting measures. Management is deceitful; workers owed many months' pay. Owner is artogant and abusive. Family culture is akin to that of a dysfunctional one. Spirit is corrupted. Mostly part time teachers working there.",
