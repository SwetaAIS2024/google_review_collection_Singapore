It's not my first time dine in at other zi char stall which is much cheaper or expensive but is to a min amount but not like this. And I worked in a fnb industry. Is pure cheating of customers food. 请自你翻新",

Perhaps bcos of the stiff competition  from 4 other tze char stalls and a food centre nearby.  Definitely value for money.\n\nYou can also get a hor fun or Sang mee for $5 with lots of ingredients.  See pics",
