Alvin Chan,5,"Perfect for what we liked to eat.  Unlike those other buffets where more is best, I don't see a point to have so many varieties and can't even try them all.

This place has a good balance of price and just the right dishes that we love to eat. Gives us focus to enjoy them.

The grill was excellent and for the first time for a bbq, the prawns were grilled perfectly, so perfect that the shells don't stick to the flesh. (Shells sticking the flesh typically is overcooked).  Compliments to the Chef!

I feel they needed perhaps one more staff to handle the Saturday service but nonetheless they were really good, accommodating and super friendly.

Perfect evening, celebrating my dad's 79th birthday!

Dogs are welcomed too which is a big bonus! Our border collie was a happy chappy.

Love the vibe and environment, will be back again soon!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108295660106474642771/reviews

Kathy Foong,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant when I brought 2 seniors to Sentosa, it was an exceptional experience. The set lunches were not only delicious but also offered great value for money.

Additionally, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Jason, Angela and the service staff. Their warm and helpful demeanor truly elevated the dining experience, making it even more memorable for the two seniors.

Thank you for providing such a wonderful dining experience. I look forward to my next visit and will definitely recommend the Tearoom to others.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112901344757298635844/reviews
