Jun Qi Ng,5,"One pleasant find in the area.
Went to the place slightly late. But the owner (father) is really friendly and hospitable.
Was happy to try their special  thosai, which is a pancake with shredded chicken, the combi of curry and yogurt enhances the already flavourful Dish.
My buddy had the mutton Bryani, the rice is not the normal Basmati, but it's very well cooked woth various spices, and a good amount of mutton.
Reccomended!
Do check out of the timing, prata and normal thosai is available in the morning and evening.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112707378125370420901/reviews
Gabriel Wong,5,"One of the best Briyani tasted. Well marinated seasoned, not too spicy, not too oily, generous portion and reasonably priced. Highly recommended!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106180520449340985040/reviews
Yan Hong Lim,5,"Came here for dosa twice and have been very satisfied. Dosa is nicely crisped and holds its shape, and the sambar and chutney taste fresh and homely - I polished them up (which is not usually the case)! Weather was cool this morning but still sunny so I had my meal outside and it was lovely. Staff was friendly and efficient! I am glad to have found this place as the other dosa option in this area hasn't been great - hope they upkeep the quality of the food. I am gonna check out their prata and biryani next.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116397363951991490875/reviews
Patrick Goh,1,I tried their briyani when the first opened. There was a lot of spices and extra fragrant. Got restaurant standard. I bought recently. The taste totally different now. Now taste more like coffeeshop type. Maybe cut corners and save ingredients costs. So I rather eat coffeeshop now.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102907154628907330356/reviews
Selvarajeswari,5,"We had ordered food from here for a house party with friends. The food was exceptionally delicious. The package and delivery was on point.
