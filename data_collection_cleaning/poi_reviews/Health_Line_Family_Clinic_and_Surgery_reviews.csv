Woon Peng Ziady,1,"Appointment and Waiting Time Issues
The clinic's appointment system is ineffective, causing significant inconvenience to patients. Despite obtaining a queue number a week in advance and arriving on time, I was still required to wait for at least an hour to see the doctor. This suggests poor time management and a lack of respect for patients' schedules.

The nurses' refusal to provide updates or call patients when their turn approaches demonstrates a lack of patient-centered care. This practice forces patients to wait unnecessarily long periods, which is particularly problematic for elderly or unwell individuals.

Blood Test Results and Follow-up Appointment
The clinic's handling of my follow-up appointment and blood test results was unsatisfactory. Despite arriving at the appointed time, I was again subjected to long waits without clear communication about expected waiting times. The refusal to provide me my blood test report upon request is concerning and goes against principles of patient empowerment and transparency in healthcare.

Missed Appointment and Lack of Flexibility
The clinic's rigid approach to missed appointments, even when caused by their own delays, is unacceptable. The lack of flexibility and failure to provide a time estimate for my rescheduled appointment shows poor customer service. The doctor's refusal to provide a consultation as part of my health check-up and the absence of an apology for the long waits further demonstrates a lack of patient-centered care.

Treatment of Elderly Patients
An incident today with the elderly patient waiting for over an hour, coughing repeatedly and being denied a simple request for water is particularly troubling. This shows a severe lack of compassion and basic care for vulnerable patients. My intervention to help the elderly patient with a cup of water highlights the clinic's failure to meet basic standards of patient care.

Recommendations for Improvement
- Implement a more efficient appointment system, possibly using digital tools to reduce waiting times and improve communication.

- Train staff in patient-centered care and improve responsiveness to patient needs.

- Provide more transparent access to test results and medical information.

- Develop protocols for handling missed appointments due to clinic delays.

- Ensure basic amenities and care are available for all patients, especially the elderly or vulnerable.

- Consider registering with HealthySG to improve accessibility and cost-effectiveness for patients.

In conclusion, this clinic's practices fall short of the high standards expected in Singapore's healthcare system. Significant improvements in patient care, appointment management, and overall service quality are necessary to align with Singapore's reputation for excellent healthcare",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112133209036035355760/reviews

ifxxh,1,Queue system and waiting time is ridiculous. Waited for more than 2 hours despite getting a queue number early. Would not recommend this clinic if a patient is very ill. each patient easily takes up 15 to 20 mins.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110244238001759438750/reviews

Daniel Lucas,1,"I would not recommend anyone seeking immediate medical treatment here. Came before the clinic was even open and waited until 10.30am for only half my queue number called (6 patients and I was number 11). My condition got from bad to worse during the waiting time and I decided to seek medical help elsewhere (instead of waiting for another few hours for 4 more people to get called before it was my turn). Went to another clinic and got diagnosed and treated within 20 mins. If you do not have hours to spare, I recommend finding an alternative clinic.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108541025465477851578/reviews
