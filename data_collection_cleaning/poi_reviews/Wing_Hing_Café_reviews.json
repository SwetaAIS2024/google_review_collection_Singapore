      "text": "Chanced upon this place after my F45 class, and was pleasantly surprised by the food and ambience. Had classic dim sum dishes like Siew mai and Har Gow, and I was pretty pleased with what I was served considering I paid below $5 for each.\n\nThe siew mai was fresh, crunchy and juicy. And the fried bean curd skin rolls were not oily.\n\nEverything is steamed or fried only upon order. My milk tea was decent; even if you’ll never gonna find a joint here that can replicate how they serve it in HK. This was a decent stab; there was that tannic punch in the tea HK milk teas need.\n\nThere was some effort in putting in a HK vibe, with the wallpaper and canto pop music, but the counter staff weren’t gruff or bored-looking  enough like they are in HK.\n\nOverall, for what you pay, it’s pretty decent. Plus, you probably won’t have to queue or wait long on most days (I often wonder how businesses in Leisure Park Kallang survive; it’s always so quiet here).",
