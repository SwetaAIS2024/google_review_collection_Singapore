Assa Lenny,5,"Great local coffee, the place has air conditioner inside and a very unique coffee museum on 2nd story (but we didn't got the chance to see it).
I love their coffee C, the taste so bold, thick and creamy. Not too sweet just right. The staff there are so friendly and helpful.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114132599023423466970/reviews
SY Oh,3,"A nice heritage cafe, you can hide from the heat on the second floor.
Iced tea was really nice and they serve really fresh eggs.
Fan choy (charsiew rice) and ondeh ondeh was alright..

Good place for tourists to come by!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107827709777347480869/reviews
Gleeko Magpoc,5,"I tried the traditional breakfast with a kopi O kosong (black coffee no sugar). I also added a traditional cassava dessert on the side.

What I liked about this is the quick service. Moreover, they have already peeled the eggs for you. The ambience is outstanding and it feels like you get teleported back to previous years.

I liked as well the nonya (traditional dessert) they sell. It was a cassava topped with something orangy sweet.

The price is a bit higher compared to other stores but you are also paying for access to their mini museum. So I think it is worth it.

Go early so there will be less people. They have both indoor and outdoor tables.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105802991965353209371/reviews

Kai Ng,4,"It’s a corner street coffee shop. We wanted a place to seat and drink.

It was crowded. Many locals seated on sidewalk full! Also inside seating  full. It was 1045am. Coffee looks delicious but we wanted a light drink for this warm humid weather.

I got plum lemon green tea. I thought it was good but a bit too salty. The name did not include “salt”. So I was not expecting it.  It was refreshing and had slivers of jelly fruit at bottom",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105345469072974394760/reviews
