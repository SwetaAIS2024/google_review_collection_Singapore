Portion is big, is worthy if you want healthy snack. Their popiah is healthy yet nice, crunchy and crispy veg and ingredient( that is the closest texture i can describe) Is a must try to me.\nStaff is fast to me too, popiah is fresh. Kopi is classic kopi.\nAtmosphere is great too\nWill be back for more.",

I ordered the mee siam special which have extra ingredients. The nasi lemak goes well with the chilli. The portion of the food is a bit too much for me so was super full. The laksa was so so and I still prefer the mee siam. The popian was normal and still not so bad. Overall this outlet food is served hot and we like it.",

Laksa egg noodle is literally maggie mee with clam. I wish they give the traditional cockles instead. The only thing nice is the popiah. We had to clear our own tray but the table is dirty and seat is oily.",

Rice was also not thoroughly cooked, the first 2 spoonful felt like eating sand..\nNo hot drinks served even before 8.30pm which was a major turn off.\n\nStandard dropped tremendously since the last time we stepped into Qiji.\nHope this is a one-off bad experience but after seeing other reviews, it seems that this outlet definitely need to step up a little.",
