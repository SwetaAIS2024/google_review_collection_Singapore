      "text": "It’s a Gem! Fantastic Tokyo Chinese Omakase with a difficult to find door. The entrance is located behind Orchard Plaza facing the road and opposite of Holiday Inn. Door is marked by 2 circles! Took me 2 rounds to find it (thanks to the staff beside the Indian/Muslim food stall).\n\nYou are greeted by Mariya-San and ushered into a L-Shaped counter. The ambience is dark and very cosy with nice music. It’s very Japanese-American feel!\n\nThe menu looks small and lite but it’s really very filling. I opted for the Sharkfin Soup (which is a MUST to include).\n\nThe menu changes and the food is excellent. The chef speaks little English and food is prepared when he sees you finishing the dishes.\n\nOverall, it’s value for money at $128 Per pax if you dun add other things or drinks. This will get popular very soon!\n\nFood wise : 5/5\nService: 5/5\nCozy: 5/5",

Staff are awesome and very attentive. Sake was soooo good.\nFood was amazing and full of flavour. Fusion 8 courses. Tasty and full.look for the hidden door at the back of the plaza and the symbol. Looks like mr magoo glasses",

      "text": "Tucked away on the side of Orchard Plaza facing Kramat Road, Ouroboros claims a unique niche - Chinese Japanese cuisine. The risk with any fusion food is that when you don’t fully commit to one type of cuisine, you also don’t excel in either. In this case, that risk proved to be real as not all dishes impressed. The occasional plate or component was interesting, like the beef shabu shabu slice or the firefly squid, but each dish in its entirety didn’t seem to come together. Still a quality venue with decent pricing. Alcohol menu isn’t too impressive but you can find Chinese wines which are cool!",

      "text": "This was one of the worst dining experiences I had in 2022.. I didn't feel any hospitality and there was minimal interaction with the staff. They appeared to be more keen in interacting with the boisterous group next to us even though there were only 2 groups (us and them) that night.\n\nEven though you hear the wok making most of the dishes, most of them end up cold when it is finally plated and served. There is also quite a bit of repeat in flavours for the dishes (mala) and even though I like mala, I felt that it took away from what they could have showcased.\n\nThere was also the big oops of forgetting to introduce the appetizers to us since they decided to move us from the corner of the counter to one end.\n\nThe dishes I enjoyed were the mala shima aji, spring roll and wagyu sukiyaki.",
