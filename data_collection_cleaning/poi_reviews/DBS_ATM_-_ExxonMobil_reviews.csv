Zheng Le,1,"I went to get gas, but the waiter didn't let me show my gas card, and then I went to the supermarket to check out. He said I couldn't use their company's gas card, and scolded me and told me to die. Bad review. Later, I paid with a bank card. The attitude was very bad. I hope you don't go there.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102778203180896530122/reviews
