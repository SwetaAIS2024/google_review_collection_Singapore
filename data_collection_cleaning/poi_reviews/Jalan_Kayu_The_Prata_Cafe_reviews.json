      "text": "I was quite disappointed with Jalan Kayu The Prata Cafe. Having stayed near Jalan Kayu before and frequented the prata shops there, I expected much better. Unfortunately, the food was not good at all, and the kopi was equally underwhelming.\n\nThe only positives are that the food is served quickly—great if you're starving—and it’s not expensive. But honestly, the quality isn’t worth it. I’d recommend giving this place a miss.",

My colleague’s meat murtabak was full of meat. Every bite is filled. Mutton was too tough. Overall reasonable food for reasonable price but too much artificial flavouring.",

Price is expensive for this serving.\n\nThe auntie cashier was also busy on the phone and talking to other staffs and have to be reminded again of order which has not been delivered after 10 mins.\n\nThe shop feels warm, with no aircon running within the shop despite it being empty.\nPlease just close down or improve. Will be te last time eating here.",

Wished that the accompanying curry was heated up.\nPrata - not bad. Personally, would prefer a crisper version. Curry tasted like fish curry and it was yummy. It was warm as it should be and had a bit of spice.\nWould come back for my prata fix if I'm in the vicinity.",
