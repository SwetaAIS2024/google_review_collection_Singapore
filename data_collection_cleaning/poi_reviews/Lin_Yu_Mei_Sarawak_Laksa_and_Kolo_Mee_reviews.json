You can choose between their signature sauce, or choose between Red or Black. Try them all! They are all good. The best part is their chili--but be warned!--it packs a punch. Everything is served nicely topped with crunchy shallots and well braised minced meat.\n\nDo also try their QQ fishballs! They are very Q ü§£",

The laksa gravy  is getting better - thicker and flavourful. But, not quite there yet, almost as good as the real Sarawak laksa in Kuching. I normally ordered large size üòÖ then have my dessert at Sugar Town next door üòä",

The shallot oil smell and taste for both these dishes are very strong. If you do not like the smell or taste of shallot oil, you should skip this stall. The noodle used is similar to instant noodle. Not much ingredients for either of the dish.",
