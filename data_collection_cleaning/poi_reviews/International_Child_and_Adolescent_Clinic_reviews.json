They tend to be pretty flexible with appointments - but the trade off is a busy waiting room with lots of kids and waiting.\n\nBad:\nThe front desk staff is a bit brusk and seems disorganized.\n\nUgly:\nThe nutritionist adds no value. One doesn’t need to pay $1K for sometime to tell them to eat vegetables and low fat foods…",

She forced me to said who is my gynaecologist. After I told her, she told me they was not closed in relationship, so will not do standby. WOW!  I didn’t know paediatrician can choose which gynaecologist  to work with. Good luck  to whoever who choose to send their kids here.",
