      "text": "Speaking from personal experience as an ex-student.\n- Teachers can prove to be unreliable. Graduated students will oversee as substitute who lack professional training in being able to conduct themselves appropriately due to lack of experience.\n\n- Lack of proper safety practices. Special needs individuals enroll here as a sanctuary but there are times where their behavior goes unchecked and results in an unstable environment.\nHaving seen a docile handicapped wheelchaired child being brutally beaten by an aggressor only for the aggressive child to continue being allowed to enroll. It sends a strong message to those who are unable to defend themselves in such chaotic environments that they aren't cared for considering its meant to be a safe haven with strong Christian values.\n\n-Fees are incredibly expensive considering that your child will mainly be self-taught in class. Teachers often are ill equipped even those who are of older age to guide your child into learning.\nAnswers for each ACE booklet which is assigned to each child according to their level of learning removes the need for teachers to be vigilant in ensuring your child learns.\n\nI strongly suggest not bringing your child here. I speak as an ex-student that came in with a positive mindset with utmost respect for the school's rules , teachers and peers but I hope you may use this as reference.\n\nPerhaps your child may not experience or have to bare witness to such things but you may want to consider other schools for your child and test the waters first beforehand before jumping into this.",
