Casey. G,5,"I was first drawn to this gem tucked in the corner of Hao Mart Westgate because of the myriad of Sakes available & the camaraderie forged among the usual crowd there is what makes it even more enjoyable. On top of it all, the captain steering the ship, Jay is always so hospitable & willing to share his knowledge in sake & other booze.

Not to worry if you just want to have a drink alone, the crowd will not bother you unless you show interest in joining. Cheers!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113671850602709702751/reviews
