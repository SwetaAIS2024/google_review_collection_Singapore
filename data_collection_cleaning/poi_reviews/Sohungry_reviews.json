Definitely very affordable meal.\n\nIn this pork bowl, there are freshly boiled brocoli, and 2 pieces of qual eggs. It is healthier version and definitely very affordable!\n\nThe curry chicken is quite spicy. If you can not take some spicy and spices, then order other dishes!",

      "text": "Nacho Cheese fish & chips. Place is always not ready when we reach early like 12pm, today it was finally opened upon our arrival at 12 noon. Plenty of Nacho Cheese on the fish, that's to my liking. Tomato pasta is bland in taste and not tomato-ish enough. Their fries are good as usual, really fried to crispy bites. Fish batter is too thick for my liking, even fish fingers have more meat than their fish.",
