Carilyene Voon,1,"I ordered from pandamart service and the things are awful and will definitely not buy from them anymore. It was a very bad experience, missing items and sending a poor quality item as shown in the pic. The garlic is rotten, and there are worms in it, their food quality control definitely sucks",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110758215312234095586/reviews
