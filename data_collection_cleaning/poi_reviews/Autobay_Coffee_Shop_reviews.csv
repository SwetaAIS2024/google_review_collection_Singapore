Jacob TAN,4,Not many stalls are operating here. The main ones are the chai fan stall which has quite a good variety of food. The other stall is selling Indian food such as roti prata and briyani. The drink stall sells both hot and cold drinks including beers. The coffee is one of the better one in the Kaki Bukit area. The coffee shop is airy and has good ventilation.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
