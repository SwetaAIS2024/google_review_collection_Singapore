Crosby Ong,5,"My all-time favourite!
I love the old style dough instead of those who use baking flour. It’s thicker but there’s a certain particular texture and taste. And their peanuts are freshly roasted and grounded (not more than 3 days) and they always serve a generous amount!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112276992196460215229/reviews
N T,4,"Finally open! Their hours don't seem to be accurate (unless they actually sold out by 9am when I visited on a Saturday previously...)

Their dough is actually more like a nian gao/muah chee rather than a spongy fluffy pancake (thick injera). Or like Korean sticky pancakes you find at their food markets in Seoul. When hot (uncle just made them) it's actually pretty sticky and soft, which I found didn't go as well with the pastes (I prefer some contrast in texture). After it cooled down, I liked it better.

Peanut - 4.5 stars
The best of the lot for me, though it's incredibly messy to eat.

Red bean - 4 stars
Paste wasn't sweet, which was great.

Yam paste - 4 stars
Unique filling but not much inside.

Went around 9.15am again on a Saturday and there was quite the line. They only had peanut, red bean and 2 yam ones left.

Made it on a Thursday before 6am and there was no line. They had everything except the salted bean.

Having tried it again and without having to line up, I'm not sure I'd return. Their ""pancakes"", as another reviewer aptly pointed out, have the texture of a tapioca kueh, so the bean paste don't provide as much of a contrast in texture as the crushed peanuts. When cooled, the gumminess comes out more as well. I like fluffier pancakes...

Pandan green bean paste - 2 stars
Not much flavour, and the filling was an artificial bright green.

Black sesame - 4 stars
One of the better ones, with ample filling, though the filling is a bit dry. I'm not a big fan of sesame.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103165559486640653412/reviews
Teck Boon,5,Peanuts are grounded by the uncle weekly and the dough to make the pancake uses a yeast rather than just baking powder. That’s why the cake itself is a little chewy but full of flavor. Gets crowded after 830-9am so go early if possible.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105978834231481267643/reviews
Kelly Chong,4,"Expect long long queue from 6.30am onwards.

Super chewy texture that resembles tapioca cake with slightly charred skin & very very generous peanut filling.

Round pancakes left with limited quantities & flavour by 7.15am.

Queue time: 45 minutes",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113576294635855971447/reviews
Matthew Lee,4,"Fresh off the pan. Very first slice of the day. Ah gong and Ah ma were slowly getting ready as I beat any possible crowd, by arriving at 0340hrs.

Seated steps from the stall patiently swiping my mobile, up til the aroma of steaming pancake competed with the wet market had my attention. Ah ma flicked the switch to light up their signboard at approximately 0415hrs.

Warm chewy gooey goodness sandwiching a big heap of crushed peanut, very lightly sweetened with white granulated sugar. A smallish 2 bite portion for 80 cents.

Not the crispy crust type. Nevertheless very addictive.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102172941439658597090/reviews
