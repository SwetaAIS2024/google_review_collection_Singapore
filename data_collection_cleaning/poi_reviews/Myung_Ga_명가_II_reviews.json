      "text": "BEST KOREAN RESTAURANT IN SINGAPORE!\n\nI come here frequently, and everything, from the taste to the service, is consistently amazing. If you‚Äôre looking for authentic, high-quality Korean food, this is the place to go. Here are the top dishes you must try:\n‚Ä¢\tYukgaejang: Hands down the best stew you‚Äôll ever have. The broth is rich and flavorful, and they‚Äôre so generous with the beef.\n‚Ä¢\tSoy Garlic Fried Chicken: No other Korean fried chicken in Singapore can beat this\n‚Ä¢\tSamgyetang : Seasoned perfectly, so comforting and flavorful. Easily the best ginseng chicken soup I‚Äôve had in my life.\n‚Ä¢\tTuna Mayo Kimbap / Spam Kimbap ‚Äì Simple but incredibly satisfying.\n‚Ä¢\tTteokbokki ‚Äì Rice cakes were perfectly chewy\n‚Ä¢\tDonkatsu\n‚Ä¢\tBossam\n‚Ä¢\tSeafood Pancake\n‚Ä¢\tNakji Deopbap\n‚Ä¢\tDwaeji Bulgogi\n\nNote that they have a Tanjong Pagar branch as well!",

      "text": "Seafood pancake, the best dish of the night. It was crispy and packed full of seafood. However, it was seated on top of a pool of oil. The pork cutlet was overcooked, horribly dry, tough and the sauce tasted unusual. The gimbap was small and ordinary. Kind of disappointed cos they were featured in food competitor ZN's videos. Banchan was also meh - kimchi was not served cold. It needed an extra kick of spice and acid, kind of lacking in flavour in general.\n\nThe restaurant has tables inside and outside of the restaurant (the common area of the shopping mall, near the escalator). As the restaurant is poorly ventilated, the dining area would be smoky and warm, as hot air from the kitchen would be trapped inside. You can request to sit outside but be prepared to wait as most customers would choose to sit outside.\n\nOverall, a disappointing experience.",
