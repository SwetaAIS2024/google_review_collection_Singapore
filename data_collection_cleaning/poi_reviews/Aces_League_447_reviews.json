Teh Si Less Sugar at $1.40. A bit pricey for certain stalls and food, but affordable options exist. Most importantly, there are 3 Halal/Muslim-owned stalls (Nasi Padang, 24 hr AL DIA and Western) so Halal options are available - as Blk 451 Foodgle does not have any Halal stall since Burgs permanently closed. Also has a Le Le Lao Huo Tang stall, Economy Bee Hoon / Porridge (closed at this review), Economy Rice, Wanted T Plus Taiwan-Food, Bar Chor Noodles, Singapore Seafood Zichar and drinks stall.",
