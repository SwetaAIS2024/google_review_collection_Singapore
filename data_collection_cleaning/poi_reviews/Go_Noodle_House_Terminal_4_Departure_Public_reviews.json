      "text": "This restaurant serves a unique pork ball noodle dish and it’s extremely flavourful, tasty and delicious. Their noodles are in the form of ban mian, and you have a choice of chunky pieces, thick or thin noodles. If you go for their Signature Bursting Meatballs, it would be a good idea if you could put the whole meat ball into one mouthful and break it into half inside your mouth. Cause when you bite into the ball, it ‘burst open’ and you can feel the juices inside the ball ‘bursting out’. The juices are tasty and definitely delicious and savourful. However if you choose to bite or cut the ball into half outside of your mouth, be prepared for the juices to ‘burst out’ of the meat ball.\nThe side orders are delicious too, and if your stomach has room for more, you should try at least a ‘dry’ version and a soup version of their noodle meal. Highly recommended if you wish to try this local favourite when visiting Singapore or even if you are staying in Singapore.\nIf you are not too sure of how to order your meals, feel free to ask the staffs whom we felt are extremely helpful and friendly, and they give very good tips on the different food listed in their menu.",

      "text": "It's lucky we have this noodle house in airport terminal 4, before this there's only the foodcourt, and frankly all that I've tried--are local food done by foreigners (Chinese & Indian Nationals). And they are soul-less, they simply do the food, with no inkling of what our local food actually taste like. Not all stalls obviously.\nThis GO NOODLE HOUSE are run by Malaysians, the food is basically HAND MADE NOODLES (Pan Mee) and the soup is the savoury or spicy (2 options).\nThe NOODLE is amazing! They have the shredded ones, the thin ones, and the fat ones. And you can choose whether you want it very firm or normal (which is soft).\nMOST of all, the CHILLI that comes withe their meals, is a watery sambal with lime skins. And it is out of this world! The chilli and the noodle is really outstanding.\nTheir fish balls and their bean curd or dumplings comes with a fish paste that are mixed with pork or salted fish. They also have beef balls. And the Tau Pok is stuffed and fried very well; it's crispy and full of aroma. They have a plain fish cake which is solely fish (no pork, no salted), and that is my favourite.\nI highly recommend this place, their food are innovative and done with a lot of attention to details. Take the lift up to the 3rd floor, you won't miss it.",
