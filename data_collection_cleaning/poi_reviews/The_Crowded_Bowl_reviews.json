The staffs here are also not very generous with their portion. Lunch time queue waiting time can get up to 30mins. Take away add $0.3. I would recommend to just get the eat in bowl if you are going to seat somewhere near northspine.",

As it was my first time here she seem impatient and sounded like she want to end work asap lol when i ask her about the menu and where to choose etc. Food was normal nothing special. Not much variety as well. Not worth the travel lol! The service make it worst and im not stepping foot in anymore. Regrets! :( my sat brunch~",

      "text": "Not a bad healthy option. It says $4.90 on the board + $0.30 for takeaway, and mine was $6.90. Not sure where that price came from.\nThe vegetables taste fresh. The lettuce is just romain so nothing too substantial. The rice is a bit oily.\nThe tofu was good but there wasn‚Äôt much of it added.\nYou choose a few sides and a main. The base is salad and rice or pasta. I think that‚Äôs how it works‚Ä¶\nNo credit but they take cash.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a healthy option on campus with lots of vegetables, try the Yong Tau Foo in south spine (fine foods).",

There was a variety of sides, ranging from vegetables and mock meats. I chose broccoli, cucumber, corn and add on with scrambled eggs. The portion was generous and the vegetables were well sauced.\n\nI‚Äôd definitely return for lunch another day.",
