As people started coming in, he got busier too, but kept his friendliness throughout the service.\n\nI had the Nighthawks and Kick Artist Fix. Nighthawks was their version of an Espresso Martini. It was sweet, gradually getting bitter as the drink dwindles. Kick Artist Fix was recommended by a lovely staff, who had a high bun and tattoos, when I asked for ‚Äúsomething sweet, but also strong‚Äù. I believe it was a Manhattan, but served together with a mini pancake that was slightly warm and tasted of maple syrup. They recommended to take a bite of the pancake, together with a sip of the drink. As it turned out, it was lovely together. The sweetness of the pancake complemented the bitterness of the drink.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it was slightly intimate, contributed by the limited space, dim lights and great music.
