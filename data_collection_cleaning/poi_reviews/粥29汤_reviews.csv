GK,4,"This is not the only stall selling porridge nor fish soup in the hawker center but there are always queues at this stall. Only non-fried fish is available for the soup and no option to add any milk, but all these never reduce the crowds. The soup is cooked on the spot upon the order is received. Tried out the fish soup once and the taste is above average! There is option to serve with rice, noodles etc. Price wise is competitive,  4.5sgd for soup and top up 0.5sgd for rice or noodles.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117427789999716038175/reviews
