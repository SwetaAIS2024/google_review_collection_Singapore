The juicy tender chicken blend with its devil üòà sambal. Yum..üòã all their devil chill set you up. Their tahu telor with black sauce will sure add kick to your rice flavour. Oxtail soup for me is light smooth broth close to your heart. Couple pax less than $50 budget in the Heartland Mall. Yimpeeüëç for brand new year 2025Ô∏è‚É£üéâ",

For the price paid, at the very least, food should be served hot. If a restaurant can‚Äôt even manage that during peak dinner hours, what should customers expect? Very disappointing.",

      "text": "Updated  23.11.2024\n\nPrice increased substantially, chicken portion smaller. But taste is still good!\n\nOne of my regular dinner haunts serving authentic  Indonesian Ayam Penyet  and many other dishes and desserts.\n\nWe usually order rice (they have nasi kuning also), a portion of  ayam penyet, gado-gado and begedel. Today, we also ordered the egg omelette.\n\nThis place does a fantastic peanut sauce for the gado-gado, creamy buttery texture with that nice strong peanut aroma and lightly drizzled with black sauce.\n\nThe begedil is another amazing creation. They will fry it after u order as it is always served piping hot, hard and crispy on the outside, soft mushy and favorful on the inside.\n\nBy the way,  Perkedel, bergedel, pegedil or¬†begedil¬†is Indonesian fried patties, made of ground potatoes, minced meat, peeled and ground corn or tofu, or minced fish.\n\nThe egg omelette is just eggs and I believe is quite like the thai style omelette where beaten eggs are cooked im generous  amount of hot oil.\n\nAnother must try diah is tahu-telor.\n\nYou can  help yourself to the piping hot vegetable  clear soup.\n\nHighly recommended.",
