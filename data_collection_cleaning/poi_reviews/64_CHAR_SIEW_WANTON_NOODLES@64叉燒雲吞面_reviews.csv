Mark Ong,4,Very decent industry hawker food located with the food court. Springy egg noodles and savoury black sauce style base . Generous in Char siew serving. Char siew is underwhelming but wanton was decent enough. Fried wanton even comes with mayonnaise dip. Overall a decent brunch to last you till dinner. Definitely fills your wanton noodles crave in the middle of nowhere.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117348003086836979353/reviews
elena chng,5,"I had their prawn & ribs noodle the last time I returned to S'pore to visit my family in Oct 2022 and I loved it! So during this visit in Feb 2024, this place is on top of my list.
This morning, I finally get to taste their yummy food again! I had the King Prawn Noodle dry (comes with big bowl of soup), a small Ngoh Hiang and a small Thai Squid.
Dry King Prawn Noodle- fantasticly delicious with their sambal and crunchy pork lard.
Prawn soup- the aroma is enough to convince you, plus the taste is just heavenly.
Ngoh Hiang-mild in taste, not too heavily spiced, the fillings taste moist and fresh.
Thai Squid- the squid is cooked to perfection, soft yet maintained it's lovely texture.
Overall, this is still my favourite place for Prawn Noodle, best in S'pore in my list.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102639557467720456298/reviews
Sean Goh,3,"Located in of one of the coffeeshops inside Loyang industrial area which is also famous for their prawn noodles. They are the 2nd or 3rd stall once you step into the coffeeshop, signboard is pretty prominent and you can‚Äôt miss it. Wanton noodle starts from SGD$4 onwards.

The wanton noodle here is the black sauce type one. The portion is quite adequate, it comes with 4 plump wantons and generous amount of nicely roasted charsiew. Noodle was nicely cooked and chili has a hint of smokiness to it. Could be a better bowl if the the sauce is not that thick.

Coffeeshop is quite out of the way to be honest. Unless if you are working nearby or if you happen to be visiting Loyang Tua pek gong temple.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
James Tan,5,"Noodle üçú texture just nice with dark sauce and light chilli üå∂.  Old school char siew is slightly on the ""tough"" side ( need more chewing  lolx). The 4wanton were niceüòã.

Ordered small portion@ $4.5 with reasonable serving size for bf.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110655842346420247846/reviews
