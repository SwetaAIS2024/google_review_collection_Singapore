Vince Ong,5,"Came to Oxygen Performance by referral, left with plenty of positive experience. Definitely will refer more friends over. Thank you Lewis, Bryan and team for going above and beyond what I had expected from a detailing company.

They coated even the paint works behind the door sills, my rims barrels and windows. Returning the shine on the original paintwork. Thank you once again!

Come to them if you value good friendships, workmanship and best of all honest pricing!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106563576390502337183/reviews
Daniel Chun,5,"Just had my car detailed by Oxygen yesterday and I couldn’t be happier with the results! Kudos to Bryan and his team who did an exceptional job. My car was factory matte grey paint so maintaining was a challenge but Oxygen did a great job and now it looks spotless inside and out, almost like new again. Their attention to detail is outstanding, and they were professional, friendly, and efficient throughout the entire process. The quality of their work far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend Oxygen to anyone looking for top-notch car detailing services!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106719507633413073158/reviews

Ying Peng Puan,5,"Oxygen Performance is hands down the best detailing company I have tried and I have tried all the other famous one. Other places just ask me to suck thumb.

Matte Paint is impossible to fix and super difficult to maintain, but their skill is amazing. The photos tells a thousand words

My car is as beautiful as the first day.
Please don’t waste money elsewhere.
They are very reasonably charged as well with high quality products",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107915626603266295178/reviews
