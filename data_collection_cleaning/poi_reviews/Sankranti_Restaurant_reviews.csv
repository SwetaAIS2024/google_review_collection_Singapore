new eyephones,2,"I recently visited Sankranti for lunch and tried their veg meals. The quantity was satisfactory, but the taste was not good, and the overall experience was disappointing. At $10.90, the price feels too high for what is offered. I wouldn’t recommend it based on my visit.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100042239048753774713/reviews
Srd G Bains,3,"It’s a small outlet … food is ok
But very expensive for that location n atmosphere
Also very spicy so if u cannot take spicy opt for something different
Rice quantity is more
Chapathi are expensive n also not so fresh edges are dry as it’s a small outlet n normally India food is pre prepared before
Dining area is there surrounded by plastic sheets.l although fans available but it’s very very hot n pigeons are many inside the dining area as it’s just off site of the road
Must try butter milk is good
Take away is the best option
Over all ok as long as u don’t dine in as it’s only available India food in that area",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100632680324370910290/reviews
Bharath Raj,2,"When i moved to Tampines, was happy to see Sankranti here. I tried Veg meals once and Mutton briyani once. The veg meals was ok, but the rice was bit undercooked. The Mutton briyani was pathetic. The Mutton does not seem to be fresh and was very hard. Not cooked well. The briyani rice was ok, nothing great.  The worst part was it's $14.5 and for the ambience and quality of meat, it's a very steep price to pay.  I might visit them again but definitely not going to order the briyani again.

Update Mar 2024 - visited here several times but the cost is too high for what we are getting. They are surviving just because there are no better options nearby.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116444583219640053121/reviews
Veronica Gilbert,2,"I ordered 1 boneless chicken briyani, gobi manchuria and 2 coffees
I paid a total of $25. If the food were tasty the price is not a big deal. But it was horrible. It was rice coated in yellow colouring, not at all briyani. The chicken has more flour coating than the meat itself. The gobi manchurian did not even taste of cauliflower. I was only eating coatings and coatings of flour. Only the coffee was good.

Please please don't eat there. I felt so cheated of my money",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107208169155454288643/reviews
Arockia Raj,3,Breakfast is good. Ghee Pongal with Vadai is the best combination to try. Be careful when Pigeon around there. Management should look on this issue.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116193178730503212505/reviews
