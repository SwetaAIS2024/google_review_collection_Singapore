Martin Yeo,4,"Great tasting fishball noodles. Better than most other fishball noodles here in SG, but not one of the most outstanding ones. Best to request for “less oil” if you prefer your noodles meal to be ‘not too oily’. Otherwise, the noodles are a great staple for the fishballs and fishcakes that are included in the meal.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107217464996017596553/reviews
GoAheadGroupFan,5,"On Monday 4 November 2024, I had laksa with beancurd with fish paste for my lunch at 85 Redhill Teochew Fishball Noodles outlet within SG Hawker food court at Mount Alvernia Hospital after taking Tower Transit Singapore MAN NL323F Euro V on service 980 from the bus stop opposite Tan Tong Meng Tower to the bus stop outside MacRitchie Reservoir along Thomson Road, and the laksa with beancurd with fish paste tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these other delightful dishes from other Encik Tan outlets in the future.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105877449322822053371/reviews
