Due to mobility issues we had a huge stroller and she even helped me bring it up. She made sure my fur baby was okay throughout because we sat outside for a period of time and she was so kind with her words to me until I was about to tear and I told her \"okay don't say already\" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹ If I ever do have another dog in future I'll definitely come back and I'll recommend this place to all my furparent friends :)",

We ordered our food, which was decent, and noticed that most tables were occupied by people enjoying drinks and relaxation. There are toys available for the dogs, and they even offer dog-friendly treats like ice cream and waffles, although we didn't try them this time.",
