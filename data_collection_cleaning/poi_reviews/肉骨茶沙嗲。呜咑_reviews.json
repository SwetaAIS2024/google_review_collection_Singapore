      "text": "This coffee shop is just below Bukit Timah 福建公会building.\n\nIf I can remember correctly; behind this 福建公会, as my mum tells me, her young days stories; it was 南洋鞋厂is the 50's, many young ladies from near by villages works here, including her's relatives and friends; lots of memories for those who born in the 1930's, before Japan occupation. Of course, lots of painful history has happened then.\n\nOn 27th Dec. 20'; our married anniversary; my wife suggested to have our walking exercise to this Ga-Hock coffee shop, having 肉骨茶for breakfast.\n\nThe 肉骨茶汤is without back soy sauce，咸菜was well stew，猪场a litter hard and 油条just okay.\n\nI also tried the Roti Prata; with egg and onion, it was well done, I like the texture and the chicken curry.\n\nFrom my observation; lots of regular customer here.\n\nThe seafood stall will only operate from late afternoon hour, might visit one of day later.",
