Jetpinn O,5,"Fin & Feathers is a rare gem in this area, and I keep coming back for good reason. While the menu isn’t extensive, there’s something for everyone. My go-to dish is the grilled salmon—I always request to swap the fries for salad, and I appreciate the generous portion of salad they served. The salad is one of the lightest and most refreshing I’ve had, with minimal oil and a citrusy dressing that makes it a great healthy option. The fish and chips are also well done—crispy yet not greasy. My child loves their homemade smoked salmon, which is juicy, not overly salty, and pairs perfectly with the pickled cucumber and onion. I hope they continue offering healthy dishes and consider adding a seasonal menu to keep things exciting for regular customers.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102400965297950619555/reviews

Quesilla Ho,5,"We had dinner here two days in a row to tell how great the foods are in Fin&feather. Their grilled seabass was cooked to right texture, soft on the meat and crunchy on the skin. Their fries are great! We were too busy eating and didn't manage to take the rest of the foods. Fish and chips, smoked duck pasta are good too. Kudos to the floor staff who served us at the dinner but we think the cashier/lady owner can be slightly friendly, so that you will get more return customers like us.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111970183065874791331/reviews
