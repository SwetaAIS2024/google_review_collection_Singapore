Cheese was so sparsely used , and the crust was dry too .. The Pizza as a whole lacked flavour but it was decent on the portion size !\nThe Pizza station was however not looking that organized and tidy ...\nThe store mostly concentrates on takeaways rather than dine-in and the person at the counter informed before hand",

My husband and I were quite confused by the ongoing promotion, but she patiently explained everything to us without showing any frustration, even when it took us a while to decide. Her cheerful demeanor and lighthearted jokes made the experience even more pleasant. I truly appreciate Rina's patience and positive attitude, which made our visit enjoyable. Great customer service like hers deserves recognition!\n\nHave yet to try the food, but i think Rina‚Äôs service just deserve the 5 stars ‚ú®",
