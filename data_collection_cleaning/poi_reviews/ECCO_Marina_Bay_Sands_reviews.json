      "text": "June at the MBS branch had impeccable service.\n\nI was looking for a pair of black leather shoes, and found the suitable design. However, the MBS store didnâ€™t have my size and June gladly offered to deliver it from another store. After I tried on the new pair, it was unfortunately too big again. She then offered me to try on my right size in another color which fitted me.\n\nAs I needed the item on that day, I travelled to the other branch instead. However, her passionate service made me feel reallly comfortable and i will highly recommend anyone to look for her",
