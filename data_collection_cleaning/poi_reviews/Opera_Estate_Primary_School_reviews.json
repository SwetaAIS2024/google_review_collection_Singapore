The time I went featured a student population of many diverse backgrounds, all getting along nicely and harmoniously together. There were also many great teachers who I won’t forget. It felt like a tightly knit community there, and I’m still in contact with some peers to this day. Would highly recommend this school to parents looking to send their kids.",

The principal is getting worse each time. The management of the school and how the teachers deal with the kids are horrendous. The teachers have 0 sense of responsibility. They often lose kid's homework/worksheets and blame the student for not submitting it. I myself have experienced this many times so did my juniors. If you want to experience a good school life, DO NOT enter this school.",
