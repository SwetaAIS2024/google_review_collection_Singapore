Piper `,5,"One male waiter was so friendly and thoughtful and constantly checking on us if we are doing ok and if we need anything. Food is decent but there are better. We went on Friday night so there was live band, and although we sat outside the music was still very loud. A little hard to talk, but it's fine since the music was nice",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103778220622318219008/reviews

Florence C,5,"Eating here was a convenient choice after bringing my kids and their friends to the Water Park. But we leave Georges extremely delighted by our decision. Service from Asst Manager Red was excellent, so was the other lady who served us. We have 4 kids and Red was so patient with us and going the extra mile when she realised we had a cake to celebrate my son's birthday.

Food choices was aplenty and reasonably priced. I would definitely choose to eat at Georges again! Thank you!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113693591949250008274/reviews

joel sampang,4,"Had an amazing time last night. The food was delicious, and the ambience was perfect for a fun night out. The warm lighting, cozy atmosphere, and great music set the stage for an evening filled with laughter and good company.

A huge shoutout to our fantastic waitress, Red! She was not only attentive and friendly but also had the best sense of humor, making it even more enjoyable. She truly went above and beyond to make sure we had a great time.

Great food, great service, and unforgettable moments with friends—can’t wait to come back!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100588719143543515563/reviews
