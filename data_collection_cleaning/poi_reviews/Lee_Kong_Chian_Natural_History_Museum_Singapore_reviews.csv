Entry is $18 for resident adults, but it’s free if you visit during your birthday month or if you’re an NUS student or staff, which is a nice perk. The museum is on the smaller side—you can comfortably see everything in about an hour—but the exhibits are high quality, especially the towering dinosaur skeletons, which were a real highlight. It’s very educational, though not the most suitable for young kids. My 5-year-old daughter was frightened by some of the lifelike stuffed animals, and we noticed other young children reacting similarly. It's worth a visit for the unique displays, but do note that it’s a bit out of the way and not near other attractions."", 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': ""A well-maintained and impressive little museum tucked away on the NUS campus.
