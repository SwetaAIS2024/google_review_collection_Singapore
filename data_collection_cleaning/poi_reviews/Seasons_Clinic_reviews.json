When I highlighted to her, she put the blame on me saying that I didn't checked it properly. Doctor was okay but the wait was rather long. I was the 6th patient but only managed to leave the clinic at 10am considering they are open by 8.30am.",

For people like us who can only visit the clinic after the office hour, this changes is definitely affect us greatly.\n\nHence, for the sake of those working people who are your patients for many years, I sincerely hope doctor can consider perhaps to operate one or two nights in the week to accommodate those only can visit the clinic at night.\n\nThank You",
