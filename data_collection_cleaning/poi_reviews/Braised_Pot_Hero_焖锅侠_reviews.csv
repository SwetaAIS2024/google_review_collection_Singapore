JAY CHUA (蔡戔倡),5,"Not sure if it’s a new store, because I usually use Deliveroo to order food. The taste of the Sichuan Pickles Chicken Pot is really good, it’s my top choice so far. I also tried the Braised Fish Fillet Pot and the Sweet and Sour Tofu. All the dishes have a rich, bold flavor, and I’m really satisfied with the taste. I’ll definitely order again. The prices are also reasonable compared to most others.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103744688691222903141/reviews
