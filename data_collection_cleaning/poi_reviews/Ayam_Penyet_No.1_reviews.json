Wanted to order the nasi rawon and nasi sambal goreng, was in the queue for nearly 20 minutes because of the slow service, in the end, when comes my turn to order, all also finished. Only left ayam penyet. No decency to inform those in queue that items are sold out, I wasnt the only one. Wasted my time.",

      "text": "For Jummah Mubarak after Friday's prayers at this area of Bedok far corner it is not only about avoiding the many degustation temptations but also for someone like me, who prefers a lighter lunch munch, quite a challenge. Mostly for my own greed or rambang mata as the Malays will point out. Guilty as charged :)\n\nAfter much scouting at the small but wonderfully packed with many halal stalls hawker centre I chanced upon Tahu Goreng or Fried Tofu done the classic Malay style. Basically it is a square big Tofu topped with blanched bean sprouts and diced cucumber and then covered by the most delectable aromatic peanut sauce. And this stall's old skool authentic offering has a darker peanut sauce that promised a richer delight. Per chance I saw they had Paru or fried lungs and I thought why not. It is quite a good paring and when combined it is more than satisfying. Sedap!\n\nThen I felt why don't I treat myself to some sweet dessert Kueh treats. Had to be careful not to be overly greedy as I wanted to sample each one and type, that is linked to wonderfully fond childhood memories, but restrained with a choice of three for two dollars fifty cents. No more cheap kuehs in Singapore anymore. At least I knew I could finish them and not waste any. There is only so much one can makan.\n\nThe kind drink stall seller ensured my fresh lime juice was truly so. Delish and wonderfully complemented the food.\n\nPop over and if you're not with concern like me – :'( – let go and try as many temptations there.",

I love the kupang goreng here. However some of the other dishes are not available if you come by early in the morning like 8.00am. They need more time to prepare some of their dishes.",
