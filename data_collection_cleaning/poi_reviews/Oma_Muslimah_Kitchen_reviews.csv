Aqisya Zolkifli,2,"I’ve been a regular at this shop for a while, and I’ve always enjoyed the food. The taste is generally good, but lately, I've noticed the portions are getting smaller, which is a bit disappointing.

Another thing I wasn’t happy about was that the nasi lemak now comes prepacked, and worst of all, there was no sambal included.When my helper went back to ask for sambal, the aunty assumed she had already put it in the bag and said that my helper was just trying to get more sambal. Its so frustrating.It's such an important part of the dish, and not having it really affected the whole thing

I hope the shop can take this feedback into account and return to the quality and portion sizes that made it great in the past.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114068519899692931108/reviews

Otoko Otoko,1,"Bad experience. FIRST Time customer and definitely the LAST Time Customer at this stall.

2 very RUDE & impatient ladies, my 81 year-old Chinese mother craved for Muslim food, so I accompanied her to order.

My mom asked for the Chili gravy form the cuttlefish, but the impatient lady just took a piece of cuttlefish and whacked on the plate.  She went on to add tiny portion of peanuts and anchovies and charged $5.

I wanted to ask her where was the egg (if this is nasi lemak set U were charging me) if you added peanuts and anchovies but she was already making noise behind her mask. I lost my Cool and told them both be patient lah! If you work in the F&B and have such an attitude, good luck!

I was reading the reviews and realised we are not the only ONE.

Mikail Yah,3,"Was abt to give 4 star as I tried their nasi lemak before and for $3 it’s awesome value.

However today they had beef rendang and i decided to give that a try and to surprised one small piece of rendang cost $3.50?!?! Even more than the entire plate of nasi lemak.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114771121650386125948/reviews
Henry Cheng,3,"Generous portion of rice for the Nasi Lemak. I think the sambal needs more flavour and spice to it. The rice was also a bit lighter than how I would like it, maybe more coconut milk and salt will kick it up a notch. Overall, I think it’s just average for the dish that I ordered, but I’m willing to give the stall another try in the future.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151994390288524704/reviews
