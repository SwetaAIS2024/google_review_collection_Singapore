Peter Ko,1,This temple use to be very good and it is also where my late parent tablet are placed. I was the on that day to pray my late parents and I couldn't find my late parents tablets so I asked the counter service staff to help me. the were so rude and reluctant to help me and after given both my parent name they told me they couldn't find. I'm very disappointed with the service of this temple. And I've even told my brother not to donate to this temple anymore.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117862041868586415062/reviews
