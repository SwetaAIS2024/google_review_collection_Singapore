Florence Leow,5,"‚ùáÔ∏è  Been to MyVillage mall many times over the years. ‚óè Nice mall, small and compact, Toilets are clean.

üå≥üå≥ This mall has a lovely roof-top wooden deck garden where I always like to take photos of the sunset from here.

Dr Reviews,4,"A tiny yet charming mall right in the heart of Serangoon Gardens. Well it certainly serves the immediate needs of the residents in the neighbourhood.

The anchor tenant here is Fairprice Finest and rightfully so considering the upmarket neighbourhood.

A couple of restaurants like iSteaks adorn the mall.

Is the mall worth a visit ? I would not make my way here if only to visit this mall. Like i said earlier it serves the immediate needs of the neighbourhood and it is a nice mall.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112747621045786494145/reviews

Sten (Piqued Wanderer),5,"A quaint mini mall that sits on a small road, or u can call it a picturesque mall, or whichever u define it, as it is has that alluring feel to it. üòÄ

It has quite a few restaurants in it and has concierge at level 2, which sits facing the escalator leading to the rooftop. A very well maintained mall despite the looks and many aesthetic works of art around. All u need to do is jz slowly walk and breathe while observing everything around. U will realise that there are creative simple designs that makes the place pleasing to look at.

The layout is simple with 4 floors to boast at the very least. There are practical and creative designs of art outside as well. Walk along the walls and u will realise this, something that some may not have realised. Talk a slow walk n chill with friends on d coolness of this mall. It is definitely not the best of malls, but it serves the purpose fully.

Worth a visit at least once.. Cheers

William Lu,5,"Small mall around the serangoon garden. It has few eateries inside and few small shops. There is fair price finest here and indostop where you can buy Indonesia's stuffs here. The shop was in the corner at fairprice, I only noticed it after I went for fairprice to shop.

There are few restaurants at second floor but iSteak seems good because there was quite a number of people queueing at there. Didn't manage to try it. Maybe next time.

I tried korean chicken stall at b1, it was crispy and good. The staff was friendly and patiently explaining me about the food on menu. Order the garlic taste and it was good. Might try again other taste next time. Came twice to the store before and after shopping my groceries, still remember what I asked for the first time not to put chili on the food which I forgot to mention when I ordered.

Here also has coffee shop which caught my attention, only sell coffee related stuff like the machine, grinding, etc.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
