I literally repeated my self three times . I even use my hand gestures to get her easier to understand . But unfortunately she doesn’t lol. Then she gets frustrated and she gave me an eye roll and a huge sigh . After that she called her boss or brother maybe to come listen to what I’m saying. But the way she speaks is like I owe her money. If I didn’t pay for your food yet, I might as well don’t want it already! And your food isn’t even that good to start off with lol. Do I owe anything?",
