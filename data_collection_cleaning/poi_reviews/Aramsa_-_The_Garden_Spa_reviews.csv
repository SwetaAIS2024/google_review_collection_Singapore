L S,5,"My mum and I had a wonderful and relaxing massage session with Stephanie and Eileen. Both therapists took great care of us, and we truly enjoyed the experience. Although there was a mix-up with the reservation timing, the team handled it smoothly and professionally. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107046091196912670352/reviews
Ifa Wilson,5,"Had a great experience at Aramsa. Jane, my massage therapist made me feel welcomed and comfortable. Not only did she provide an exceptional massage that relieved my tension and stress, but she also went above and beyond by giving me a short tour of the spa and took some lovely photos. Her friendly demeanour and dedication to customer service made my visit memorable. I highly recommend Jane for anyone looking for a skilled and thoughtful massage therapist üòç",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100010598766694579914/reviews
Lily,5,"I was craving a really good and relaxing massage for stress relief and I was so happy that I got one here :) I called in on the day itself and miraculously managed to get a late afternoon slot for a 1 hr Aramsa Touch massage. My masseuse was Taphine who was absolutely fantastic. I wanted a light/medium tension relief massage and it was exactly that. She also noticed when I was getting slightly uncomfortable during the session (my nose was getting clogged from lying face down haha) and made the necessary adjustments which I appreciated a lot. The whole ambience (lush greenery!), massage rooms, lounge and wash areas were modern, clean and really set the tone for a relaxing atmosphere. Worth every penny and I‚Äôll definitely be returning for future visits :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109157660504199766098/reviews

Lalitha Bluecloud,5,Had a very delightful experience at Aramsa The Garden Spa. My first time here. Easy access from Carpark A. Felt transported to a foreign land with all the lush greenery! You get choose one essential oil from 3 options for the massage. My masseuse was Sun. She was very attentive and skilled. No hard-sell at all which I found very impressive. Worth pampering yourself or your loved ones here!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113472036745077756628/reviews
