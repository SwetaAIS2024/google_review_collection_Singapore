      "text": "I've been coming to Freebird for about a year, typically when they just open and have no crowd or music. I'm not a \"regular\" by any means - I might come once in 6 months or twice in one month.\n\nMy motive has always been the same: top shelf craft beer on tap. And that, together with top shelf Service is what Freebird has consistently delivered across many random visits.\n\nThey curate, tap and price their beers exceptionally well.  The presentation of the beer and the pricing (particularly the 20% off on draft beers on Tuesdays and Thursdays ), means I've yet to have a bad experience in my many visits, which is remarkable.\n\nEqually noteworthy is the high standard of service regardless  of who is on \"duty\", whether it's Harry, Jason or Veron I've always found Freebird staff to be attentive, knowledgeable about beer, and ready to have a conversation about anything under the sun.\n\nIn my studied opinion, Freebird is on the shortlist of top 5 craft beer venues in Singapore. I wish them continued success in the future!",

      "text": "I stumbled upon Freebird one evening and it quickly became my go-to bar in Singapore. The craft beer selection is incredible—always something new and exciting on tap—but what really makes it special is the vibe. It’s warm, welcoming, and ridiculously easy to make friends here.\n\nPeople actually talk to each other, laugh, share stories. I’ve heard “one for the road” more times than I can count, and every night feels like a little celebration.\n\nAs Pitbull once said, \"short steps, long vision\", watch this space.",

Seats are sprawled alfresco. Rotating 10-beer tap list. Curated cans in the fridge. All craft. Good local selection. The cheese is really the KFC. Katong Fried Chicken. Lotsa onion flavour in the batter. Takes some time to come but definitely worth the wait! Weekend nights do get busy so reserve!",
