Yang Ying Tay,5,"Mr Ang is a very patient teacher which is clear and concise with his delivery of concepts. Undoubtedly, Mr Ang is a very capable teacher that taught me to love Math more. Before he taught me, I used to think of Math as an obstacle and something that I would not want to study in future. However, he has made Math so much easier and digestible for me. With him as my teacher, my grades have improved significantly. I would definitely recommend him as a teacher.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101582512701801750756/reviews
Qinyuan Zhou,5,"Mrs Ang's lessons are very interesting, engaging and effective. I personally could easily absorb what the lesson is about and apply the knowledge in the worksheets that she gives and the worksheets in school. She also provides notes to all her students and the content is concise and easy to understand. A wonderful tuition center indeed, helpful and effective.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106687917233335352603/reviews

ashley huang,5,"Mr Ang is a funny teacher who makes sure that we enjoy math and tries to make full use of the time we have, the notes that were given to us are well organised and concise which is way more useful than our school notes. The recorded lessons are also super helpful in ensuring that we do not miss out any lesson even when we cant make it for that day:)",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103834427971030915605/reviews
Dan Stryker,5,"Mr Ang's online Math tuition gave me a glimmer of hope to do better in Maths. He teaches clearly, systematically and in an easy to understand manner. He covers a variety of practice questions in his bi-weekly 2-hour lessons. I can understand Maths concepts better under his tutelage. I still have some way to go in my Maths journey, but I am confident of making it a success with Mr Ang's help and with my own diligence.ðŸ˜„",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116401852719499298234/reviews
