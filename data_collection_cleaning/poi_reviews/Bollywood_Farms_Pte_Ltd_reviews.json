The farm reminded me of my Grandparents' farm in Indonesia, full of greenery, fresh air and so serene. May this farm continue to exist with its charms and beauty!",

The lemongrass drink was too diluted. Could have done better.\n\nThe fish n' chips were served with no lemon. We were informed that there was no lemon available. Nasi lemak set was good.  The fried chicken can be elevated with more rempah.\n\nOverall, its a good lunch. üëç",

The food is great, the staff are friendly and the ambience is truly like a much needed getaway.\n\nHowever, as much as this place is lovely for food and drinks, the whole farm is just breathtakingly beautiful. There are so many events that you could join as well as so much about the farm you can learn. The trees, the plants, the fruit and flowers, the list is endless.\n\nIn Singapore, there‚Äôs a land scarcity as so many are used to build buildings. It‚Äôs so refreshing to see a farm in our very own Singapore where it‚Äôs as authentic and rural as it can be. If you‚Äôre looking to clear your mind, or just take in the wonderful nature, this is the place to go!\n\n10/10 in charm, rustic and simple vibes and all in all the closest we can get to a kampung right here.",
