Laurie Thompson,5,"We had an absolutely great experience working with Dinu and his team. They packed and moved our entire flat so quickly and efficiently, sorted boxes into the proper rooms at our new place, and picked up the boxes as soon as we were done unpacking. Communication was prompt, prices are very reasonable, and not a single item was damaged. They made our move as stress-free as it could have been. Highly recommend!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108869907419955113831/reviews
