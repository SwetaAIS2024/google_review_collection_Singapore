Yap Hoe BENG,5,"Nov24, has been & eating Pau here at this coffee shop. The pau is the best until it is now selling at Takashimaya but here at the coffee shop the coffee is best. Takeaway with beautiful box for giveaways. Very reasonable pricing. The prawn noodle is also good. Note Prawn noodle is not available Wednesday/ Thursday. Pau usually sell out by afternoon especially on weekends.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116220693681278781294/reviews
Michael TAN,4,The lady that served me was very friendly and knowledgeable. It was because of her recommendations that I spent $30  for 20 small pay and 5 normal Bak Pau. Taste of the Pau was good.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106408988733162382676/reviews
Ng Wei Meng,5,"Bought small char siew bao at 1.00, small red bean paste bao at 0.90 here. It is pretty pricey for the size of the bao.

Filling of char siew bao are pretty genuine, can bite bits of pork belly.

Will try the big bao instead, the cost price ratio of small baos is pretty much high.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103072959491907955597/reviews
Xq Law,5,"Wanted to try the bao but they weren't closed for the public holiday. Got the prawn noodle (dry) instead. Ordered the prawn and pork rib noodle but the stallholder said they were out of ribs. He still very nicely gave me the last remaining piece of pork they had left. The Mee/beehoon was nicely cooked and broth tasted great. I asked for chili but was not prepared for how spicy it was, left about half the paste untouched. I was lucky to get one of the last bowls of noodles for the day, they turned away customers before 11am, a record time according to the stallholder.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103933056001741944467/reviews
