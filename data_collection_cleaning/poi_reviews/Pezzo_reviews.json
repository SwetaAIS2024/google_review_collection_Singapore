      "text": "Late review: After grabbing desserts at Annabella Patisserie, my wife and I found Pezzo Pizza at Jurong Point Mall to complete our New Yearâ€™s Eve dinner.\n\nThe pizza options looked amazing, so we picked a few slices with different flavors. Each slice was loaded with toppings, and the crust was the perfect mix of soft and crispy.\n\nIt was a great addition to our celebration meal, and we loved the taste and quality. Definitely a spot to check out if youâ€™re craving pizza at Jurong Point!",
