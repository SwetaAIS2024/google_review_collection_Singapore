      "text": "This review compares this Malay stall and those along Loyang Way all the way from 64+4 coffee shop ☕️ to this location. (There should be at least 3 Malay Stalls along this 600m Stretch.)\n\nI believe this BFF stall wins hands down! 👍👍👍 Stall is very clean 🧹🧼🫧, the location has ample seats 🪑, windy 💨and the food is soooo good 🧆🍲🍛! Legit good Malay food stall!\n\nMorning they serve Mee Rebus 🍜, Mee Siam, Lontong, curry puff 🥐 and Chicken Porridge 🍚 in the morning. Afternoon you have Nasi Rawon, Nasi Ayam 🐥, Ayam Penyet 🐓, Nasi Lemak 🍗….etc I’m giving a special mention to Ayam Penyet! You see my pics and you will know how much effort they took to place, set and display the food before they serve it to me.  (I’m impressed!)And it tastes so good with their homemade chilli 🌶️🌶️🌶️! If you are going for the Mix Veg Nasi, I highly recommend the Beef Rendang 🐮. It is always the first to get sold out.\n\nAll the staff are very friendly and do come early as it gets very crowded after 12.30pm + they have a healthy take away service too.\n\n#bestmalayfoodatloyangway\n#friendlyandclean\n#aymapenyet\n#chillipower",

      "text": "I’ve been looking for a good Nasi Padang stall near Pasir Ris and this place is the answer. Definitely worth a detour as it is within the industrial area, but only a few minutes away from Pasir Ris. I ordered Chicken in back sauce (slightly spicy), sambal goreng and 2x bergedil. It cost $7 which is reasonable as Malay cuisine is a lot more work. I used to travel to a popular stall in Bedok North so I am glad I have found this place much nearer to me. The staff were friendly and the place is windy and airy with high ceiling (no aircon). Good thing to note this Loyang Food Village is at 64 Loyang Way and has free parking. Not to be confused with the 64+4 Loyang Coffee Shop near the Tua Pek Kong temple.",
