Elle,5,"This is one of my favourite Yong tau foo stalls in Singapore. Their soup is light but has enough flavour to consider it proper soup, unlike many other Yong tau foo stalls I have tried. They do fry some of the ingredients for you and would ask what ingredients do you prefer to fry or add to the soup.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100984952203197490357/reviews
