      "text": "A while ago, I had an unexpected visitor—a bat flew into my house and ended up injured. Not knowing what to do, I reached out to NParks, and they responded quickly and professionally. Their team provided clear guidance and ensured the bat received the proper care it needed. It was truly reassuring to see their dedication, knowledge, and care for wildlife in action.\n\nSingapore is lucky to have an organisation like NParks, not just for maintaining our beautiful green spaces but also for looking after the creatures that share our environment. Even with my busy schedule, I wanted to take a moment to appreciate their hard work. If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, do not hesitate to contact NParks—they truly go above and beyond!",

He actually got in touch with me while on the way , ask for pictures of the snake and tried to calm me down..after 30 min Shannon and Lester showed up at my place, caught the snake and put it safely in a box! What an amazing service! So efficient and professional! Thanks to the whole NParks team and huge thanks to Lester and Shannon!",

      "text": "I have come across nparks trapping birds for the purpose of killing them right beside the hawker centres under the name of “bird management”. This is such an ineffective and short term policy if this is how you want to prevent birds flying to the leftover food. The source of the problem which is the food disposal should be the issue that you tackle, not the killing of these birds that are instinctively looking for food. Please change the method of doing things rather than killing these poor animals (birds, boars) anytime issues arise.\n\nYou can try strategies like covering food tray return areas/ensuring secure nettings (because some of the hawker centres that have nettings are not secure due to improper sealing) etc.",
