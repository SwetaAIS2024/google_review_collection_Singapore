      "text": "One of the popular stalls within West Coast Market that serves fishball noodle. Came down a few times wanting to try but unfortunately, the previous 2 attempts were unsuccessful as they were sold out by the time I reached. I was greeted by a long queue when I reached, however it moved pretty fast. Apart from the fishball noodle, they also sell meatball noodle. The price of the noodle starts from SGD 4 onwards.\n\nThe noodle was nicely cooked; texture of the noodle was springy. Noodle was on the oily side.  My bowl of noodle came with ingredient such as sliced fishcake, fishball and meatball. The meatball which were homemade tasted not only delicious, it also has a good texture. The soup that they gave was not bad too, just a little too peppery.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the noodle especially the meatball, I think I will order the meatball noodle instead.  Besides that, I would also request for less oil the next time I eat because it got a little towards the last few mouth. I would still recommend to give this stall a try.",
