Doreen Ang,1,"I‚Äôm writing to express my disappointment with my recent visit. The toast served was cold, limp, and tasted like it had just been taken out of a bag‚Äînot toasted at all. Toast should be hot and crisp, and unfortunately, this fell far below expectations.

Additionally, the dark sauce was diluted and lacked flavor, making the entire meal unsatisfying.

More concerning was the hygiene practice I witnessed: the cashier was cracking eggs and handling money at the same time without washing her hands in between. This is highly unhygienic and poses a serious health risk. Handling raw ingredients and cash should be kept strictly separate.

I also noticed several staff members standing around chatting rather than focusing on the food quality. It gave the impression that attention to detail and customer satisfaction were not priorities.

I urge you to review your protocols and staff training, particularly around food handling and service quality. If these issues aren‚Äôt addressed, you risk losing more customers.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116711410230570163801/reviews

Francis Marzuq,2,"Bad service by senior staff, rude to customers even during crowded times. If can't handle the crowd, have lesser dine in table and chairs.

As for varieties of local delights, there are chee cheong fun, soon kueh, etc. Will come back more if not for poor service crew.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100575347180839133028/reviews
