Vincent Khoo,3,"No frill fried chicken with spaghetti. Cannot say the best, but at least they fried it upon ordering, so still crispy. Will come back again if happen to be nearby.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845981260181580873/reviews
Benito Linus,5,"Ordered their Set B which consist of a chicken wing and a chicken breast or ribs, and fries with rice. I requested for breast meat but it was sold out so I was told to wait about 10+ minutes for them to fry a new batch of chicken breast for me. The wait wasn't too long and the buzzer start ringing at around 10-12 minutes time.
Fried chicken was very good, very old-school taste! Rice has a bit of garlicky taste and it's very fragrant!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114106152376985360330/reviews
Saiful Anwar (Saiful Anwar),5,"If you been to Malaysia Bazaar and came across their fried chicken, yup it’s them. Situated just beside Alexandra food village, it’s their first outlet serving chickens in delicious batter made by their own recipe. Went on their first day and it’s agreeable that the queue was long. But buzz word do travel very fast. Purchased their promo $3 for 4 piece chickens. Their batter is very nice and moist, not greasy and can last long when take away. The menu is very simple and easy to order. Definitely worth the visit to dine in or takeaway. But do factor the waiting time.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117916840836722733797/reviews
Brandon Yeo,2,"The hype is still bringing the business to them. They are not prepared for business. How could they not have spring chicken prepared at 1.30pm? I was informed that they are defrosting.

The wait was pretty long at 30 mins. Could get similar or better at Arnold's. Gonna probably be my first and last visit. Left disappointed.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105654128362934703471/reviews
W L,4,"Great tasting fried chicken without the  cloy oily aftertaste. Agree with the tag line on the signboard - deliciously succulent crunchy and crispy fried chicken.

Price is a little steep if you opt to get the individual pieces. It would have been great if they could have a bundle/bucket/party set price of x number of pieces.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112917591831961441915/reviews
