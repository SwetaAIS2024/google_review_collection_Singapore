To insure the quality they provided multiple proofs and retakes until they got my photography colours correctly for the book production.\nHighly satisfied with the experience and I am recommending Ho Printing to everyone.",

The quality of the books was excellent (one was full colour, and the other black and white). The service and communication of Wah Yuen Ho and his team was also absolutely superb. I have really enjoyed my experience dealing with Ho Printing and  I have no hesitation in recommending them - in fact I continue to do so regularly to others in the writing community here. Keep up the great work team! I look forward to having more books printed with you in the future.",
