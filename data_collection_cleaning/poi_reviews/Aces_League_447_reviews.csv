Tiara Ong,3,"Coffee promotion price states 80 cents. When I ordered and wanted to pay stallholder said it's for small cup only, But not stated. Sheer misrepresentation.

Cindy Tan,4,"Ok S$5 lunch from Barchor Mee Stall, food presented was as shown and tasty, which is important as some places showing soft yolk hard white egg do not present it on actual. Teh Si Less Sugar at $1.40. A bit pricey for certain stalls and food, but affordable options exist. Most importantly, there are 3 Halal/Muslim-owned stalls (Nasi Padang, 24 hr AL DIA and Western) so Halal options are available - as Blk 451 Foodgle does not have any Halal stall since Burgs permanently closed. Also has a Le Le Lao Huo Tang stall, Economy Bee Hoon / Porridge (closed at this review), Economy Rice, Wanted T Plus Taiwan-Food, Bar Chor Noodles, Singapore Seafood Zichar and drinks stall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117742565422712661738/reviews
