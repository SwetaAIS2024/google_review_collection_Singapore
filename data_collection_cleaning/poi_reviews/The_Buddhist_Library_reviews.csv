Ling Ing Siong,5,"I am really impressed by the professionalism and help rendered by the resident monk for the House blessing ceremony and willingness to go extra mile despite his busy schedule of also supervising the exam on same day. So far... the support and experience has been great, no words can describe the experience and the great help rendered by Buddhist library.
Also many thanks for the great support and coordination by Mary. Without her great help, I guess I am still stuck...",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102508170333209892406/reviews

Marissa Lee,5,"My favourite library in Singapore. There is a membership fee if you want to borrow books, but it’s worth it. Alice the librarian is also very kind. Suttas, commentaries and biographies from each of the traditions - Theravada Buddhism (the way of the Elders); Mahayana Buddhism (which speaks the language of its audience); and Tibetan Buddhism (which gets a bit esoteric) - can be found here. There are also books on quantum physics because Buddhism is about seeing the true nature of things.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118376949577608031841/reviews
