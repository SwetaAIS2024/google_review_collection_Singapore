In the past, it was already very organized, and even more so now.  This is a company that continuously improves and make things better.\n\nFrom pre-planning to the completion of my father's passing and ash scattering, Ms Ang and her team stayed with us throughout the whole process, providing prompt assistance to our questions, making it so much easier to focus on what we need to do for our father.\n\nThe entire team is very professional, and our guests were also very impressed with the very nice setup of the whole wake, we even have some guests requesting for their name cards!\n\nThank you very much Ms Ang and your team again.",
