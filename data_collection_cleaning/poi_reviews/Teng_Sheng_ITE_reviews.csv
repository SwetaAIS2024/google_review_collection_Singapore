Raine Ong,5,"We didnâ€™t know the place last order closes at 8.30pm and came at 8.25pm. The stall was nice and accommodated us. Food and service were great! Didnâ€™t take a lot of pictures but my favourite was the è™¾é…±é¸¡, claypot tofu, bee hoon and the tomato egg. Very authentic putien cuisine and prices are reasonable - highly recommended, no gst no service charge! :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100162570719950222835/reviews
Albert Wong,5,"A great China cuisine here. The prawn, noodle, fish, and the mushroom soup are very delicious! Air conditioned and a good place to grab dinner with family and friends.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102973031068229321793/reviews
Charlene Lim,5,"Food here is really good, a fav would be the crab beehoon! Great value too!

Thereâ€™s a fish dish that lots of tables ordered, will probably try that the next time.

Would visit again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117447857806989523984/reviews
gee M,3,"Great service from staff, food is reasonably priced and quite tasty though thereâ€™s a bit too much of MSG/salt. Also got free dessert if u order zichar. We got the suancai fish, prefer if it is not pre fried with batter. Stir fry yam and harcheonggai is good.

Place was quite packed for weekend dinner, only thing is the inside seating didnâ€™t have very good circulation so the cooking smell lingers.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113534020976231477384/reviews
Elaine Chia,4,"Was recommended by a friend and so we decided to give it a shot. After the first visit, we went back shortly for a larger family gathering.

The food tasted great, and very flavorful. Love the beancurd pot and also the shrimp dish. However, the after effect is real, needed to drink a lot of water to get by after the meal.

Itâ€™s a small family restaurant type, quite nice for a weekend gathering meal. The space outside the restaurant is kinda good for young children to play around.

Service was great! They are very attentive and do not pressure you to leave after your meal. They also provide free dessert which was quite nice to end the meal.

Itâ€™s now our go to place for gatherings, but perhaps the next visit, I would request for less salt, less oil and less sugar ðŸ¤£",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109984404323679586196/reviews
