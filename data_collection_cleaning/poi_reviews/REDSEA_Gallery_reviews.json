The lady at the reception was welcoming and friendly, inviting us in to have a look while not being intrusive during our time there. It was a small gallery but there were many beautiful art pieces. I expecially liked those by artist François Bell which were mostly deconstructed items in resin. Another piece that caught my eye was by Taher Jaoui which was a fun and vibrant painting. Definitely take a look if you're in the area!",
