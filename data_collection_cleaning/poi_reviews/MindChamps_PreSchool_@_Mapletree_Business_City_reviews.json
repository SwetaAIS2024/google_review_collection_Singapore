      "text": "Mindchamps @ Mapletree Business City is a GREAT school - our boy comes home every day excited to share about what he learns at school, and talks lovingly about his teachers and friends\n\nEvery morning, Ms Chong checks on our boy diligently and teaches him to greet the day with a smile üåª\n\nEvery evening, he shares about what he learns - going beyond the academics but also things around the world. Special shout out to his teachers Wu Lao Shi and Ms Adrea who is so patient with him when it comes to learning Chinese and music üé∂\n\nSpecial shout out to his form teacher Ms Franny. She pours her heart into the job and I see her on weekend birthday parties and kids‚Äô play dates. It is no surprise that she was loved and moved at the K2 graduation earlier‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs almost like her graduation too as a 2nd mummy to the class. Don't be deceived by her coloured streaks and her tattoo - she‚Äôs puts her ALL in the role as an educator, disciplinarian, and most importantly friend. The kids know it too - my boy called her ‚Äúhis best friend‚Äù until the other boys bribed him away with Pok√©mon cards.\n\nThe school isn‚Äôt complete without the top-down support of Principal Ms Bee. She has the job of managing the school as a business and parents as customers - but we have never felt the disconnect vs. enrolling our boy in a school with a heart ‚ù§Ô∏è",

My daughter's young mind has grown, learnt, and blossomed in ways that have exceeded my expectations over the past two years of attending Mindchamps Preschool, which provides diverse content including reading, writing, maths, music, gymnastics, etc. She frequently mentions Ms Franny and Wu Laoshi at home and she is grateful for their loving care and devotion. As parents, we are also grateful for her teachers' professionalism and kindness.",
