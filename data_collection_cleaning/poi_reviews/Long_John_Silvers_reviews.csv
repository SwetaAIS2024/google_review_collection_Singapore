Regine Koh,2,"Ordered the new buffalo single fish burger set. As u can see in the pic, is one soggy mess. Do not expect much when hot sauce and wet coleslaw on crispy fish. Taste wasn't bad tho. If you like mushy bread on mushy fish with mushy vegetables. The fries are good though.

AC is almost non-existent . It is not even crowded. There's only 2 of us customers in the shop. Is that why they do not bother to turn on the AC?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115452065015070429093/reviews
Howard,1,"Bad food, bad service, bad atmosphere.

Fries were cold and fish was dry. When we returned the food, the replacement was sent to our table in less than 5minutes time and they simply mixed in some hot fries and the fish was still as dry.

Air-con wasn’t working, and Coke weren’t gassy. I am never going to dine there anymore.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110674897393719499746/reviews
