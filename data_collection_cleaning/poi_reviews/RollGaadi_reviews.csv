chu xuan,4,"3.5 stars!

Ordered their butter chicken roll for $8.90. It's a long thin wrap and on the smaller side.

The chicken meat is a bit dry and the wrap has no sauce, but it's decently flavourful! Had some crunchy veggies inside but wish it was more filling. Prata wrap is very crispy and nice!

Overall not bad taste and an interesting concept, but I personally wouldn't buy again haha. I do like that they provide a small seating area with free tissue, and that the staff helpfully informed us that it will take 7 to 8 minutes to prepare the food.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900991350615107188/reviews
sk sk,3,"Went to this outlet for the first time yesterday,at changi city mall.
We ordered for Butter Chicken wrap and chicken Momos.
The wrap was nice but we were very disappointed with the taste of momos. The momos tasted as if, they were market frozen ones ,tasted full bland and not even salt was there. The staffs were polite and quick with the order.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104473319859158664706/reviews

Quan Teng Ho,5,"Tried this thing called a Kathi Roll at this kiosk in Century Square. It was really nice! It's basically using a prata as a wrap and then they will add the filling inside.

I asked the lady boss what a Kathi Roll is and she said that it's a street snack found in India.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115124677922200088050/reviews
