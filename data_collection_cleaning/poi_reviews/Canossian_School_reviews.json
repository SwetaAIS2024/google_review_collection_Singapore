      "text": "I am alumni. I cannot express how badly I was treated in this sch... Most teachers are racists cuz I am from brown poverty country. One of teacher treats everyone nice and gave each of them birthday presents and on my birthday, she didn't even say it and when I said it's my birthday, she didn't give me. It's not the present I wanted it's the respect I didn't get. I may be messy but I am innocent. They only help those who are strong but I am weak in academic cuz my family did not have proper education other than me. I have teachers who humiliated or frame me in front of whole class. People say it's because I did bad things but they don't dare to humiliate some good students who did bad things on purpose. I was supposed to receive award for high scores but someone Chinese who scored lower got the award last minute for Thanksgiving. Don't think about sending your child here if you don't want them to be verbally abused by teachers there especially hearing impaired side. I deal with these for 6+ years. I couldn't even get to attend alumni events cuz of those teachers I hate alot even if I tried to be forgiving. They tried to crash my dreams by saying that I will never make it or calling me stupid or useless. Now I have made it to university when they said I can't even attend ite. Pls for god sake don't send your child here. I have a friend who suffer the same as me cuz of her speech problems. She couldnt speak due to her tongue but teachers were really harsh on her and called her useless in front of sch and don't care about bullying cuz we are bullied by teachers too. ðŸ¥²they think I am some stupid undeveloped brain person but I just act fool when they treat me bad and come home to tell mom that my school was good. No child should face this. Teachers need to be equal with students and help them instead of leaving helpless weak students like me. However some teachers are nice.",
