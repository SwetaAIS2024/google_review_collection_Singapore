      "text": "My child had attended Orange Tree Preschool since PG to K2 and I would very much recommend this preschool to anyone! The school's environment is conducive and definitely safe for the kids. It has outdoor playground and mini swimming pool within the compound for the kids to have fun without worrying about their safety to cross roads or be in the open public area. Teachers and staff are also attentive and caring. They will call the parents timely if anything arises. Parents are also well informed of any events. The teachers are skilled in teaching and coaching the kids to build their foundation in reading and writing, which really helped a lot for the kids to transit to primary school. Kudos to the Principal, teachers and staff of Orange Tree Preshool (Choa Chu Kang)!",

Curriculums and activities are all well planed in place in developing the kid in all areas. External lessons like art ,speech and drama, robotics are available too.\nTeachers are all very committed and responsible, caring, patient and kind. Very Fast and responsive too. Most of the teachers had been with the school for many years and maintained very good relationship with the parents.\nMiss Hema, the principal had been there for more than 10 years. She is the best that I have ever known. Very committed to providing the best to kids, planed and managed the whole school with the well being of kids as her top priority. Friendly and caring to everyone. And she can remember every single kid names and their parents!\nOverall, excellent preschool experience for both of my kids! Very blessed and glad that both of my kids were with the school for 4 marvelous years of their childhoods.",
