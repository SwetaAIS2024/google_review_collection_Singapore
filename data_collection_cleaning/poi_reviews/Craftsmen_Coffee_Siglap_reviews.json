Crisp and a perfect base for the decadence of a lovely berry sauce and strawberry ice cream + cut fruits, I thoroughly enjoyed polishing this dessert. The Rosti was just alright. Done well. A solid cafe offering good, consistent options. Good for an easy brunch in the area",

The salmon eggs Benedict was done perfectly and their breakfast set is not bad too! After eating here, you can skip the next meal.\nCoffee is also pretty good so I totally recommend this place for a nice weekend brunch",
