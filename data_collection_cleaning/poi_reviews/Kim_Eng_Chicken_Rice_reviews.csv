Melvin Liew,4,"Decent chicken rice for daily meal. Better options in the market nearby.

Boiled dumplings were not good - the skin is too thick without sufficient meat filling.

Staff are friendly",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102951175816995376482/reviews

CK C,3,Chicken rice tasted average. There was also no minced ginger. Gizzards came in a mountain for only $1. Friendly staff.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Andrew Ang,3,An average chicken rice—portion was quite small and nothing particularly special. Decent if you’re just looking for a quick bite.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107102294621091457763/reviews
Rio Wang,4,"Hainanese Chicken surprisingly good and using fresh chicken instead of the usual frozen ones we see all over these days. Wanton soup can give it a miss, nothing fancy, definitely not a wow. It's usually understaffed and avoid lunch timings.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103067140074042430707/reviews
