It is a beautiful place for sports enthusiasts, has a lot of indoor facilities for cricket as well as football. The place has a changing area and sitting area outside as well. You can book for two hours or one hour. Weekends is a bit rush but the playing experience was really good. We had a lot of fun and we plan to do it once in a while!",

It was a hot day but the big fans inside was quite accomodating to cool down the place.\n\nBe careful on parking at the roadside, saw TP officer came and took photos on some of the cars parked there. There wasn't a parking space at the location exactly.",

The penalty spot in the pitch i played in WAS MADE OUT OF STONES. They assume no responsibility for the safety of the participants.\n\nThis place is now a disgrace. They are more focused on spending money to built better counters and seating areas when in fact the money should have gone into TAKING CARE OF THE PITCH\n\nABSOLUTE HORRIBLE TIME PLAYING ON PATCHY, UNEVEN AND ROCKY GROUND.\n\nbaffles me how this is deemed safe. Absolutely disappointed.",
