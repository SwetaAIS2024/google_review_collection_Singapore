      "text": "I had a terrible experience at Jimmy Choo. The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. They seemed reluctant to assist me, and when I asked for help, they gave me short, dismissive answers. It was clear that they didn't want to be bothered with me.\n\nI immediately contacted MBS to complain about the terrible service I had received from the Jimmy Choo staff. However, I never received a reply from Jimmy Choo, which shows that they don't care about their customers or their satisfaction.\n\nOverall, I would strongly advise against shopping at this outlet. The staff is rude and unhelpful, and the company doesn't seem to care about their customers. Save yourself the trouble and shop somewhere else",
