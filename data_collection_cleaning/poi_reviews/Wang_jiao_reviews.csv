Lee Miao Wen,5,"First thought after dining at this place, ""I NEED TO BRING MY MOM HERE COS SHE'S GONNA LOVE THIS""

Must try: pan fried dumpling, har kao.

The portions were generous, the seafood was fresh, and the pan fried dumplings were well fried, not oily! The steam pork ribs and San Lou Hor Fan were full of flavor. Pity it's a small place so it gets packed quite easily, but it's worth coming down to have a meal with your family if you're up for a good dim sum, Hong Kong food!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102632512649429471425/reviews
jermine tan,5,"chanced upon this place after taking a random bus from mandai bird paradise because no taxi wanted to pick us up - dropped down at this springleaf MRT area and walked past an entire street with empty stores, but this place was PACKED! curiosity got the better of us so we popped in and wah. no regrets. the fried rice there is bombastic, like primo wokhei, very fresh prawns used in the yang zhou fried rice, and my partner loved the beef fried rice!!! i would have ordered the dimsum if it wasnt so busy. highly recommended if you are in the area! Cash only or nets or paylah - no credit card, so be prepared!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103171898461696663820/reviews
