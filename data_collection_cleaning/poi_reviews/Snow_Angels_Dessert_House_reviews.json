Bingsu at $15.90 for the portion and condiment is overpriced, see photos attached. Ownersâ€™ daughter displays better customer service to her friends than the owners did to their customers. Place was not well air-conditioned and had flying ants zooming around.",

      "text": "Best Bingsu in Singapore! In Bukit Batok!\nThe shaved ice was really smooth and powdery, reminiscent of the ones I had in Seoul!\nSnow Angels in Le Quest.\nThe shop is facing the main road on street level.\nCan't wait to try the other flavours. They have savoury ones too.\n\nUpdate (back again just 1 day after I visited it):\nTheir Signature Injeolmi Snow bingsu ($15.90) was very delicious too, though I personally prefer the matcha one ($12.90) as it had the ingredients which I like. The Chicken and egg waffles ($15.90) was a good combination. The waffles was so tasty that I didn't need to dip it into the maple syrup that was given and could still eat it even when I was so full! Highly recommend this place. Looks so modest but able to deliver high quality food!\n\nUpdate (3rd visit):\nOrdered matcha bingsu again. Consistent, very good though the ingredients were slightly less (guess the first time was more due to opening special?). Ordered the bacon and egg waffles. Saved $4 as I bought the voucher on ShopBack for $9.90. Original price $13.90.",

With generous toppings of almond slices and red beans,  this bingsu can easily feed 2-3 pax. One of the best bingsu I had so far. Definately worth a visit- Snow Angels at Le Quest:)",
