So sweet!\n\nPistachio cake tasted great and was just the right size. She offered the information that my buckwheat tea could be refilled once, another nice gesture.\n\nHighly recommended for their healthier desserts that are just as delicious. üòã",

      "text": "The Japanese shortcake was absolutely delicious and *LIGHT* which is uncommon since cakes are usually heavy and very sweet. This is perfect for those who want a lighter and healthier choice of dessert to enlighten your mood. The delivery was earlier than appointed time despite it being very early in the morning with no damage or whatsoever on the cake. Seller made sure to send me updates and is a quick replier. Would definitely order again!",

The best part about this cafe is the vibes and service, every time I drop by I feel so welcomed. The owner really goes the extra mile to make everyone feel welcomed. She is super friendly and thoughtful! If you‚Äôre lucky you will be greeted by Tokyo, their cute little golden retriever doggo who will be around usually on Saturdays. 11/10, absolutely love this place. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
