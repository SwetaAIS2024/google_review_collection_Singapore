Amelia,5,"What a ‚Äúhappy coincidence‚Äù experience I had last Friday when I met Joanne in Ascott Raffles in her mini workshop.

I did jamming session, I learned not only how to create an art but she also shared her amazing art journey.

I always wanted to understand how abstract artist produce their arts and Joanne elaborated it clearly.

I found the jamming session very relaxing, calming and I inspired to start doing it to release my stress or just to express my feeling moving forward.

Thank you so much Joanne, good luck and hope I can join any of your session soon.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107859889051090487915/reviews
