      "text": "This $4 wonton noodle soup is a solid late-night option. The wantons and dumplings are fresh, with a good balance of meat and seasoning, while the noodles have a nice, springy texture. The broth is light yet flavorful, making it a comforting choice. However, the char siew is disappointing—it lacks the rich, caramelized flavor and is a bit dry. Despite this, the portion size is reasonable for the price. Since it only opens at night, it’s a great spot for a late dinner or supper. If the char siew quality improves, this could easily become a favorite for those craving a warm bowl of noodles after dark",

      "text": "People in the area know of this place, usually boasting a slight queue.\n\nThen again, this market is weird with the varied opening hours of each store. Still, this store has its fair share of customers.\n\nOrdered the medium dumpling noodles ($4.50) each size a difference of $0.50.\n\nDumplings were amazing. 3 huge dumplings filled with substaintial filling. Nice prawn with meat bits, a great chew and an overall great taste.\n\nNoodles with sauce was great. Now my issue with this place, always has been is that the sauce is always less than what is needed for a good mix with the noodles. As such, noodles are often left unsauced. However, you dont get the dry texture but a sticky, slightly alkaline taste. Thats not to say that the noodles has no taste, it does, just that it has no sauce on it.\n\nThe taste is strong enough to be traced on each bite of the noodle but the sauce is insufficient to ensure a wet enough mix. Taste is grsat, I just wished they added more sauce.\n\nSoup has a unique ginger taste, almost edging that of tang yuan soup but slightly salty. The soup is okay, I wouldnt say its great. Honestly wished it had that  salty kick.",

      "text": "Hawker stall and known in the area for an evening late night wanton noodles. Plain and simple with the noodles well cooked and the wantons are very traditional Singaporean style. Char siu (bbq pork) not much to shout about and the only thing which didn’t go down to well was the soup had a tad too much MSG.\n\n$4.50 is a good supper portion if you are a big eater you might want to go for a bigger serving. The gentleman taking orders is always very friendly.",

Char siew is super dry card board type. Some imaginative may sweet coat it as old school. I wouldn’t come all the way or queue for it.",
