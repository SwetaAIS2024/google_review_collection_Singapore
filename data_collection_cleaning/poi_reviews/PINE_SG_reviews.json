The team’s sincerity and thoughtfulness truly touched me. They not only helped choose a suitable plant based on my requirements but also ensured the order reached me in time. Thank you for going the extra mile!",

They have a great selection of products and when I wanted something slightly different, Winnie was great with her suggestions and prompt with her replies. Delivery was also easy. Would definitely recommend and order from them again :)\n\nI ordered for the second time from Pine just recently and again the service was great! I asked for an order to be done within a week and Winnie was more than happy to oblige. It was delivered on time and i we kept updated throughout. The final result which was a gift for a friend was lovely!",

As I am not a plant lover, it was difficult for me to choose the plants to gift. (I only knew which crochet covers I wanted, haha!) PINE SG staff was very patient and friendly, and they helped me with my queries and selection! The whole purchase process went smoothly and I really enjoyed it. It was not agonising and I liked how friendly and prompt the staff is. I would definitely come back to purchase if I need to gift more plants. Highly recommended! ♥️",
