wai siong cheah,1,"This was my first time trying pizza from this brand. I ordered a cheese pizza, which, based on the menu photo, is supposed to have spinach on top. However, the pizza I received did not include any spinach. When I asked the staff about this, the initial response was dismissive, with one staff member simply saying, 'That's just how it is.' I received the same answer when asked again. Upon asking a senior staff member, I was informed that the spinach they received that day was spoiled, so it could not be used.

While I understand the situation with the spinach, it would have been courteous and professional to inform me beforehand, allowing me to choose an alternative topping or even a different item. The lack of communication and the indifferent attitude of some staff members left me feeling disappointed and undervalued as a customer. Clearer communication and better customer service would greatly enhance the experience.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118432639177486807032/reviews
Matt E,1,"Worst pizza in Singapore. The ‚Äúall meat‚Äù pizza was mostly onion. Pepperoni pizza - one piece per slice. The photos are nice, the actual food is awful. Avoid - do not order from here.

Jerusha Soh,2,"Not worth the price. Overall taste was so so. Pizza didn‚Äôt turn out like the photo too. Prawns were small, overly salty and seemed like the frozen kind.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112762178688504391580/reviews
