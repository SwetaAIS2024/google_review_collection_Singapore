      "text": "Today is my 1st visit as Parkway Shenton is my company panel clinic. Upon registration, I was told there were 7 patients before me. I have now waited for more than 2 hours and it is still not my turn. The front line staff explained that some patients were here for medical check. Perhaps, u can assign 1 or 2 days solely for medical checks, instead of holding up the queue. User-experience need to be improved.\n\nThe saving grace of this clinic is a patient female doctor (Doctor Chin) and 2 polite frontline female staff.",

      "text": "Dr Cherlyn Chin attended to me as I was there for a routine health check. She was really professional and steady with drawing blood and giving jabs, making it less scary than they seemed. Dr Chin was also very detailed when giving explanations about the options available for health screening and was patient with answering my questions and going through the medical report with me, as well as offering adequate medical advices to improve my health. Adding on, the 2 counter ladies are also nice and helpful. Thank you for the pleasant clinic visit experience.",

When I finally got a response, they simply emailed me the report without any explanation or follow-up call to discuss the findings. Dr. Loke attended to me, but the experience felt rushed and lacked the personal touch I’ve experienced at other clinics during my annual check-ups. Based on this, I wouldn’t recommend their services.",
