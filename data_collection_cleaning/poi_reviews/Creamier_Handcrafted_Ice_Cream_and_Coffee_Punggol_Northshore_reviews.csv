Travel & Food,4,"A nice place to get your sweet tooth taken care of. There have a variety of ice cream flavors, coffee and other desserts. Also they have. Dog ice cream, which your furry friends will love.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106053886224922371151/reviews
Lisa T,4,Earl grey is their classic flavor and won’t go wrong. Tried peanut butter fudge but find it average. My favorite is their waffle as it helps balance the sweetness in the ice cream.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101998729191684176802/reviews
Dough Pillow,1,"TLDR: Staff told me waffle not available, but I just saw him make waffles for himself to pack home.

When they say the restaurant is closes at 10pm, does it mean that I am allowed to order up and dine up to 10pm?

I rushed to Punggol outlet and got there at 9:20. The restaurant was in a mess with many uncleared tables. The staff took 10 mins to attend to me because everyone was working on closing. I wanted to order waffles but your staff told me it was not available. Interestingly I just saw him make waffles for himself to pack home.

It’s my first time here in a long while so I needed some time to look at the flavors and decide. During this time the male staff just walked away and decided to do something else instead. The other staff just ignored me to do closing. My question again is whether staff are required to serve me up to 10pm or are they closed at 9:30pm to do closing? If so, it is only fair to the customer that the closing time or last order be 9:30pm.

In hope this message is read by the owner/founder themselves and not just replied by a support staff. Your establishment has really horrible issues that you need to resolve. Maybe you should spend some time in then restaurant to see what is happening.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103042544584692532461/reviews
Ron Yang,5,"The gula melaka flavoured ice cream is unique and tasteful. Worth a try!

Atmospheric and full of vibes near the northern shoreline.

A bit on the pricey side, though. Worth a try. Thumbs up!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104960568279362160422/reviews
Benjamin Park,5,"A nice chill ice cream cafe to hang out and have waffles. The waffles are definitely a class above A&W which is just next door. Comes with honey drizzle at the side and the waffles are crispy and delicious. There are a number of ice cream flavors to choose from, I chose the lychee and earl grey ice cream. The ice cream is delicious and definitely can come back kind of place. Dinner time can be crowded too. Oh there is a menu for dogs so if you’re a dog owner it’s pet friendly and you can order some treats for your dogs which is a nice touch considering there are many dog owners in the heartlands. Worth trying out if you’re in the north shore area and want to look at the sea after a meal.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117599988314464672388/reviews
