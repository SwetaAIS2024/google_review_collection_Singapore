      "text": "I participated in TFF's Serenitea workshop, where we got to learn about the different herb flavours, before crafting our very own tea blend. The facilitator was very engaging and explained the flavours of individual herbs in detail, while we were treated to a tasting session of the different combinations. I really enjoyed how hands-on and interactive the entire workshop was, and best of all, we got to bring home a generous pack of our personal herbal tea blend!",

We got to smell each ingredient and enjoy some tea brews before understanding how each ingredient affects us. This was followed by a session of making our own brew and then tasting each participant‚Äôs brew. It was very fun and heightened our interest in local plants and their uses. Thanks TFF team!",
