Tissany Tan,5,"Had a pleasant experience with Dr Tan ‚ò∫Ô∏è Went there for my annual full body mole check and she was thorough and detailed in explaining what moles I should monitor and remove.

Really efficient because I immediately booked a mole removal surgery the next day and she only took 30 mins to remove 3 mole including stitching them. Being someone who‚Äôs afraid of needles, she was assuring and we were happy conversing during the entire surgery process (did local anaesthesia and the only pain I felt in the process was the needle). The staff were very detailed with the post care instructions as well ü§ó Happy with my experience here!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112605271235643606382/reviews

Flo Yeow,4,"If you know the issue that you walk into this clinic for, and stand by your opinions (without being stubborn), you'll be very alright visiting them. Despite the many polarizing reviews written, Dr Paul Chia was patient in our first consultation, and the nurses supported him in his treatments very nicely too.

Of course, given that it was the first treatment, he'd naturally ask about the other observations that he sees (e.g. hair thinning, lazer treatments A vs B, etc), just to discover more as a doctor, and offer considerations for you to think about. No pressure whatsoever, just proper discovery and diffusal techniques used before delivering the solutions.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
