khrhms,4,"Good brunch spot and friendly service! You can pick and choose the items for your board, perfect for those who want more protein. Food came relatively quick given that it was a busy PH. Nice aesthetics in the cafe, lifting up the mood. However, given that it’s close to nature, there’s a few creepy crawlies and insects flying around. The spot we were seated at was also pretty hot and humid. Would be great if they could provide fan or indoor air conditioning as some seats might not be well ventilated. $59.84 for two people with 1 board, 1 pasta and 2 drinks which is not bad.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
Justin Lee,5,"Visited on a rainy public holiday morning. The place was empty which was expected. Food and coffee didn’t disappoint. The focaccia were airy and had a good crust. Scrambled eggs and breakfast roll were also cooked perfectly. Not too dry or too runny. French toast had the right amount of sweetness. A proper brunch spot, would recommend.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107374628830921760349/reviews
Gregory Athanasius,5,"Tucked away in the tranquil Singapore Botanic Gardens, Small Batch provides a charming and laid-back setting for a delightful breakfast or brunch, characterized by its ""pretty place, pretty food, pretty vibes"" atmosphere. The cafe's menu showcases beautifully arranged and carefully prepared dishes, with the fresh and visually appealing burrata, accompanied by tomatoes, avocado, and sourdough, being a particular highlight. Guests also appreciate the option to personalize their breakfast with the customizable breakfast board.

Overall, Small Batch comes highly recommended as a relaxing haven within the Botanic Gardens, welcoming families and offering a peaceful escape from the city's energy. Its key features include its serene location amidst the gardens and its emphasis on quality, artisanal food, with the burrata and breakfast boards standing out.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101240389824842882822/reviews
Mei Yi Yeap,5,Cosy place close to the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden -- you can even see (and definitely hear) the kids having a splash in the water play area. Nice chill vibe. You get to customise your own dish by choosing a selection of smaller bites. Overall food is pretty good.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105952848007991953931/reviews
SJ Shaw,5,"Came here with my partner and we both ordered the ‘Build Your Own Board’ menu option. There were so many items to choose from! The food was amazing and the coffee was delicious.
The staff were friendly and efficient.
We would definitely recommend this place! :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103531240895613695014/reviews
