      "text": "Come here for the views. One of the restaurants at the rooftop of Marina Bay Sands that let you access these views without staying at the hotel. Minimum spend of $30 per person. The food and drink were nothing to write home about. I‚Äôd rather have a regular laksa over the laksa spring roll. The tripe was delicious but that bread was sopping wet with oil.\n\nWaitstaff should be encouraged to ask bartenders for customer recommendations. I stated my preference as spirit-forward, bitter, and herbal, and the server recommended the Amalfi gimlet. ü§£ So random! I rolled with it anyway. The drink was unbalanced, too much citrus and not enough syrup, and way too little gin by modern standards‚Äîdid they measure out the ingredients at all? It sucks to pay that much for something I can make better at home.",

      "text": "The view at Spago Singapore Bar is absolutely stunning, offering a breathtaking panoramic view of the city skyline and beyond. It‚Äôs the perfect setting to unwind, whether you‚Äôre enjoying a sunset or the vibrant city lights at night. As for the food, it was nothing short of spectacular. Every dish was beautifully presented and packed with incredible flavors. From the appetizers to the main courses, everything was prepared with such attention to detail, and the taste was even better than expected. A truly memorable dining experience with both great ambiance and exceptional cuisine!",

The price point isn‚Äôt the cheapest, but fair considering the location and quality of the food and service.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a place to enjoy with friends, or celebrate a special occasion, with the best views of Singapore sky line, Spago is worth a visit.",
