The batter of the deep fried baby octopus was light and crispy but the ratio of the batter to octopus was like 2:1.\nWe like the sourdough but a bit pricey, 2 pc of thin sourdough cost $7 and wasn‚Äôt served with butter, it was an item on the menu.",

      "text": "The space is beautifully designed ‚Äî modern, airy, and thoughtfully curated. It‚Äôs a lovely environment to sit in, and the presentation of the food was also visually appealing. You can tell there‚Äôs attention to aesthetics, both in the interior and the way dishes are served.\n\nHowever, the food itself didn‚Äôt quite meet expectations. While the display was beautiful, the taste was average. The bagel, in particular, was a letdown ‚Äî lacking in texture and flavour. For a caf√© that puts so much effort into style, I had hoped the quality of the food would match.\n\nService was also a weak point. One female staff member was noticeably unfriendly and came across as disrespectful to certain customers, which made the experience uncomfortable. Other staff were more neutral, though they tended to gather and chat when not busy.\n\nOverall, it‚Äôs a visually impressive caf√© with potential, but both the service and food need improvement to make it worth a return visit.",

Also ordered a black coffee after consulting with the crew on the bean profile.\n\nThe crew were pleasant and attentive as they would ensure my cup of water gets refilled. The atmosphere was also comfortable - not too noisy on a weekday.\n\nSpecial shoutout to JD and Ashley whom kindly recommended/explained about the different type of beans the cafe has, so that I was able to decide and bring a bag of beans home to enjoy. Will visit again!",
