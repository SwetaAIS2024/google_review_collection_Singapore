Panda Joyce,5,"I learned about LCTA while searching for a Chinese enrichment class for my daughter. I have always been wanting to find something that is more interesting because I want to spark her interest in Chinese. So we went for the LCTA trial lesson, and she came out from her class bugging me to let her continue. (That‚Äôs a first! üòÑ) I also love that my daughter knows how to use the Chinese words she learned in class when she communicates now.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106005762522328079836/reviews
