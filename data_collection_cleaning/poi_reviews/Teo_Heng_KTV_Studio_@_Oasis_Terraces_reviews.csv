Billy Cheng,5,"Great place for small family to have a singing session! Very convenient for us staying around Oasis Terraces. We booked a medium room for 3 which I think the room max can fit 4 people. They have another medium room has 6 sofa seats and small room with 2 seats. Sound system is good, songs are very update, especially K-POP. Can drink $1 and we brought our own food. The system let you finished the whole last song even times up. They open till 1am on weekdays and 2am on weekends.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111053164897173159555/reviews
kelly,5,"I recently visited this place, and I can't recommend it highly enough! The atmosphere is incredibly cozy, making it a perfect spot to unwind. The room was superb – clean, tidy, and very well-maintained. What truly stood out, though, was the exceptional service. Every staff member was professional and attentive, but one female employee, in particular, made a lasting impression. She was incredibly friendly and patient, answering all my questions with a warm smile. Her helpfulness truly elevated the experience. I will definitely be coming back, especially for the 5-star service she provided!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107882713049480505694/reviews
Clayton Soh,5,Fuss free and easy but tough to book during busy periods due to its huge popularity,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115714118276066098436/reviews
Jaty T,3,New outlet so it's pretty clean. Sound system is better than the one at White Sands. However Teo Heng still has a LONG WAY to go when it comes to their song selections. There are many songs that you can't find in their list compared to the bigger karaokes like Have Fun and Cash studio. Then again I guess price plays a part as well!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117373966914071690582/reviews
Fion Ho,1,"The person serving us at the reception on 2 May around 3.45ish, young man dyed hair with specs was very rude to us. we had to clarify what he was telling us because we didn’t understand what he was talking about in English so we ask back in Chinese. When we asked in Chinese he seems 不耐烦 like I am just clarifying why so pekcek. Ridiculous behaviour he said ‘刚才跟你讲了你听不到吗” basically like I already said can’t you hear?. We asked you nicely on whether you can say again but noooo we got a rude reply back.
Please rectify this problem as its a very unpleasant experience",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109127343047801242466/reviews
