C,4,"The Therapeutic Garden at HortPark is a peaceful space designed for relaxation and well-being. While not spectacular or particularly photogenic, it’s still an interesting highlight and a nice place to pause and unwind. The thoughtfully arranged plants create a soothing atmosphere, complemented by gentle wind chimes and cozy seating areas. A worthwhile stop if you’re exploring HortPark—calm, refreshing, and a quiet retreat in nature.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
