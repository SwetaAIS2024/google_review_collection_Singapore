Stephen Pasfield,5,"Many say that this is the place to stay to watch the Formula 1 in October with fabulous views of the racetrack below but my visit in May was luxuriously quieter, and more appealing. The staff are attentive, friendly and extremely helpful in looking after all of your needs, especially when attending the vast and delicious  breakfast buffet which accommodates all eating idiosyncrasies. The rooms are extremely modern and spacious with fabulous views.
Highly recommended!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111153234892940336237/reviews

C.C,4,the lobby and the elevator design is wonderful and entertaining. The daily housekeeping is also very nice! However the room itself might need a renovation a bit old and dirty.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108892830185877639927/reviews
