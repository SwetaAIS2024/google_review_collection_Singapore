Yi Ling,4,"Came here on a Saturday night for a dinner celebration. We ordered a good variety to share. It was rather empty at around 7 pm, around 5 tables worth of guests. Great for big table groups gatherings.

🍤  Prawn Roll
This is our go-to order. The ngoh hiang here has really good fillings. I like how the meat is still moist and juicy, and the water chestnut and carrot bits are still very crunchy.

I rate: 4/5 🌟

🍝 Mixed Hor Fun
Used to come here very often for their Hor Fun because the hor fun noodles here was one of the chewiest and had really fragrant wok hei. I have to be honest here. The standards dropped 3 years after I came back. The hor fun noodles just seemed so mediocre. Sauce is still good, though.

I rate: 3.5/5 🌟

🦀 Crab Hokkien Mee w Open Leaf
Seasonally priced for their crab, we were pretty lucky that this huge crab had really fresh and tender flesh. The meat in the pincers was so supple and came off the shell so easily. The Crab roe was used to fry with the noodles, giving the while dish a strong crustacean fragrance with the woody aroma from the Opeh leaves.

I rate: 4/5 🌟

🫛 Dried Prawns w French Beans
This was really aromatic. I like how the Ikan billis is fried really crispy with the cubes of prawn and coated with the chilli flakes in a savoury sweet sauce. Stir fried till its dry, the mildly spicy and very aromatic condiments goes well with rice too.

I rate: 4/5 🌟

🍳 Salted Radish Omelette
I really love how thick and fluffy the cai po Omelette is. Leaning towards the sweet side, this cai po Omelette is a hot favourite for all ages.

I rate: 5/5 🌟

🍗 Salted Egg Pork
Safe choice. Meat is chunky, and salted egg 奶油 sauce is savoury.

Jas,5,"This humble kopitiam may not have the fanciest decor, but the tze char dishes are a pleasant surprise. Despite its unassuming appearance, the friendly aunties and uncles make you feel welcome. The food is delicious and satisfying, with good portions and reasonable prices. Don't let the rundown appearance deter you - this is a hidden gem that's worth a visit for some comforting home-style cooking.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113337122584904295969/reviews
