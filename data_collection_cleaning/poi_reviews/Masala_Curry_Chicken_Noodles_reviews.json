He's very picky on curry noodles.",

      "text": "Trued once when they first opened a year or so ago. Today, I gave them another try. Though there were some visible changes, the test of curry mee is still in the eating.\n\nAnd it was worse this time. The masala curry was neither Hainanese nor hokkien taste. The chicken was bland and tough. It was obvious they put on some efforts, but perhaps they just need to do a serious reevaluation of their recipe.\n\nYa. This is just my opinion. They do seem to have some customers during lunch hpurs",

Surprisingly I think it is not bad..Not sure about the masala part, but as a curry noodle is definitely worth eating...Nice curry that's not too oily and generous ingredients as shown.. for $4.50.\n\nI would say it's a big bowl. I won't specially travel here to eat but if around this hawker centre and wants curry, I will still buy it again!",
