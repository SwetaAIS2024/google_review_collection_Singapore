Pricing at $5.90 for this late night supper.\n\nOpens until 4am, according to the sign.\n\nNo other customers at that time. The staff was polite and friendly. Maybe things have changed for the better at this stall. Cheers!",

      "text": "Not that fantastic curry puff to be excited about. Their standard really has drop alot. If you can see my photos below , you can see such a small little pathetic amount of chicken meat. I have lost my words to talk about this curry puff, used to be my favourite place to buy curry puff.\n\nWell you can try to eat there, maybe when bring back it taste so so. Anyway they do sell Nasi Lemak which is so so also nothing special .\n\nGo ahead and try if you guys happened to pass by that area but no need to purposely go there lah, not really worth the trip.\n\nI m sure there is other great Curry puff and Nasi lemak to try in Singapore.\n\nAll the best if you decided to try, Don't say I never warn you.\n\nStay safe and Healthy always .",

This place according to the staff is not 24 hours but closes at 3am.\n\nHavent had richie's for awhile now but i must say standards have dropped tremendously, though I appreciate the staff making it fresh for me the curry puff had oil sipped through the big hole in my puff and it was practically doused in oil especially the filling. I too couldn't agree more with the other reviews that said fillings tasted rancid, it was true.",

      "text": "\"I recently visited Richie’s and had an extremely disappointing experience. The kitchen was poorly lit, which immediately raised concerns about cleanliness and food safety. The staff member who served me was rude and dismissive, only to become overly nice and insincere right after cashing me out. This sudden shift in behavior left me with a gut feeling that she may have even spat in my food. I was so uncomfortable that I ended up not eating it. This experience seriously made me question the standards at this establishment, and I won’t be returning. I recommend others think twice before eating here.",
