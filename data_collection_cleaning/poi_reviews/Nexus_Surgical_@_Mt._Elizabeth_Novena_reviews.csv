Thava Mani,5,"My heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to everyone who attended to me at Nexus. From the counter staff ( 2 amazing ladies) who comforted me and went the extra mile to ensure I got an operation date slot and kept reassuring me that I will be fine and not to worry - to Dr.Lee Yee Mun with his unassuming and jovial demeanour literally made me forget I was unwell. His experience and wealth of knowlege shone through and made things so clear about my condition. I will recommend thia place to everyone who needs expert medical service. I am eternally grateful to Nexus as I move forward with my treatment and healing. GOD bless all of you.

Janice Loh,5,"To Dr Lim Khong Hee and staff team:

My experience at the clinic was great, from 1st consultation to post gastroscopy visits. The booking of appointments with the clinic and the hospital was fast and efficient. I received professional advice and treatments and appreciate Dr Lim's careful diagnosis. He was helpful in ensuring that the cost of my treatments were claimable under my personal insurance. He also explained in detail my condition and the options available.
My spouse and i are thankful. May the Lord's blessings be on you and team as you continue to treat more patients. ðŸ˜Š",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112319862905422976023/reviews
