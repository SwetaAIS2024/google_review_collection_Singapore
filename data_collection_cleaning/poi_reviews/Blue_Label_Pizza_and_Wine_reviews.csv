Medric Chew,5,"Hands down the best pizza I‚Äôve had so far! The service was great, and the ambiance was just right‚Äînot as loud or noisy as some people say.

My friends really enjoyed the Japanese-style pizza (totally forgot the name), but for me, the ""Original Famous"" was the winner. So simple, yet the blend of cheeses made it so, so good. Just a heads-up‚Äîeat your pizza ASAP because the crust gets a bit dry and tough if you wait too long.

The sides are on the pricier end, but hey, if you‚Äôre up for a treat, give them a shot!

Will definitely be back for special occasions!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103146187074913164978/reviews
Bryan Ong,5,"Blue Label Pizza takes classic New York pizzas and gives them a unique, elevated twist. Their crispy, well-balanced pizza base provides the perfect foundation for their creative toppings, making each bite a delightful experience.

While the prices lean on the higher side, the quality justifies the cost. The ingredients are fresh, and the flavor combinations are well thought out. A standout is their Japanese-inspired pizza of the month, which brings an exciting fusion of flavors to the table, proving that innovation can work beautifully with tradition.

Beyond the food, the ambience is modern and inviting, making it a great place to enjoy a leisurely meal. The atmosphere, combined with delicious pizzas and premium ingredients, makes Blue Label Pizza a worthy spot for those willing to splurge a little on high-quality, creative pizza.

Would definitely recommend it to pizza lovers looking for something beyond the usual fare!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110761390753733640797/reviews
Jessie Ching,5,"You must come for their corn chips & artichoke dipüíñReally love the combination. Just for the two of us,  a 12‚Äù pizza was good enough. There‚Äôs something special abt their dough; so crisp and chewy.

It‚Äôs was a rare find like a speakeasy bar, off the main street if Ann Siang Hill. Its entrance is at a clean alley whose display window is just under the hotel ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è what an interesting location in Singapore ‚ù£Ô∏è",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107250920094900418972/reviews
David M,5,"One of our favorite spots for pizza in SG. First time to this location, and it‚Äôs quite quaint. Has a bit of a speakeasy vibe. Always have a good selection of ‚Äúclassic‚Äù rock playing.

Apps, pizza, and beer are consistently good. Our favorite is the white label, but can‚Äôt go wrong.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107345381570989890261/reviews
G Review,4,"Must order the artichoke and spinach dip and chips!! So good we polished it off. The pizza was good but not great, a bit too burnt for my liking if you ask me, so the crust was quite bitter. The crust was also too thin for my liking. The carrot cake was recommended by a friend but the 3 of us were so disappointed, it was way too sweet and dense. I took a bite and couldn‚Äôt bring myself to take another one. Atmosphere and staff were 10/10 tho!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106985639759485757837/reviews
