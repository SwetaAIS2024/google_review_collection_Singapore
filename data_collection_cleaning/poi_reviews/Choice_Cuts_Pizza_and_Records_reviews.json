      "text": "Choice Cut is more than just a pizza spot —it’s a whole vibe. The cozy space, paired with an interesting playlist, makes it a great place to chill. Their New York-style pizzas are freshly made, and the unique flavors really stand out. Hell’s Chicken with the hot honey add-on was a game-changer — spicy, packed with flavour, and just the right balance of heat and sweetness. The Buffalo Chicken was another solid pick, delivering that classic tangy kick.\n\nThe pizzas here are big — if you’re not a big eater, one slice might already fill you up. Prices are on the higher side, but the quality makes up for it. It does get really crowded during peak dinner hours with limited seating, so I’d recommend coming during off-peak times if you want a more relaxed experience.",

      "text": "Long story short, I LOVE Choice Cuts. I come here every week (even though I shouldn't for my diet). It’s the best pizza I’ve had in Singapore. It’s a bit pricey, but it's worth it for the quality. I love it when they have music, as it’s hard for me to find a place with music I like in Singapore (I’m Latina, so it’s impossible to find good Caribbean beats). The chefs are super friendly and accommodating. The only thing worth noting is that the place doesn't have the best seating, and sometimes, they close without being a holiday. They close earlier, usually when they run out. Other than that, 10/10 would recommend it to anyone!",
