I was skeptical in the beginning due to the reviews but Dr Wong is a friendly and professional doctor. She answered most of our questions in the most easiest way that we can understand. Staffs are all friendly and approachable. Back to our hometown, we had forgotten to get a memo for insurance. Was told 3-5 working days but received it right the next day.",

She doesnt use too much medical term like other doctors. It was very easy to understand and very straight forward. She is really careful handling my elderly mum. Appreciate all the kindness from everyone in this clinic.",

Dr Lisa did not even make the correct primary diagnosis (which was glaring to another gynae I have gone to for second opinion) so I’m pretty sure this is negligent. She also lacks empathy and is extremely unskilled in pain management. I’m disappointed.",

Dr. Wong took time to review my medical history, explain everything regarding my appointment in detail, and answer my questions. Her staff was extremely friendly and kind. Dr. Wong was comforting when she could see I was nervous, and walked me through every step of the appointment. I would return to see her again and recommend her to friends. Also, I spent less than predicted by the front desk, so I believe she is extremely fair.",

Doctor Lisa and her staff were kind , accommodating and attentive. They made sure to attend to any queries I had even after the consultation was over. My visit here ( twice now) has only been a pleasant and positive experience. Thank you to everyone in the clinic for being so accommodating.",
