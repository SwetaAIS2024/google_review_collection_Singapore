The chicken wing was well marinated, juicy, tender but not too oily. It was relatively big as well.\n\nAs for the beehoon, it wasn’t that bad and goes well with the chili. What I like is the portion was big.",

And a female cashier excitedly engaging conversation with either ex staff or staff from other outlets.\n\nI pack 5 wings and the aroma filled my car.\n\nThe skin is crispy with slight hint of marination. As I bite into it, the flesh is a bit tough and bland. The chili is definitely not spicy but very salty. The chef might have mistakenly put more salt than chili.\n\nOverall, I would not Q again for this stall unless other outlets prove otherwise.",
