Chandramohan Devaraju,5,"Very good devotional place. No words to explain and place to feel yourself.

Though I visit this place for more than 15 years, I just got a chance to write a note, as it was close to my heart as a home & may be the reason I did not thought of writing before.

Andrew R,5,"While in the area we wanted to have the opportunity to visit this temple, as someone who is not Hindi I find it interesting to observe how the devotees pray. We have, as far as I know, nothing like this in Germany. For non Hindi you must remove your shoes (you can wear socks), if you are a woman you must dress modestly and cover your shoulders. Men who wear a tank top or shorts above the knees must wear a provided men‚Äôs sari. While we were there a tourist was taking photos of people and making a video of the inner area and this is forbidden! To photograph people you must ask their permission too! I am not faulting the temple, but really please do respect their rules. I took photos of a few things with this in mind. Well worth the visit if you want to open your mind to different ways of living.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100488933974589821233/reviews

Sundar M,4,"Mind peace temple. Situated in main serangoon Road. Got big parking space within temple premises, but sometimes it's occupied by temple itself for any festivals.  So limited parking only available on a first come first serve basis. Usually every Saturday is crowded and offers prasatham.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116248991858885491182/reviews
