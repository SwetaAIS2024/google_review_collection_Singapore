      "text": "This Poke Theory place is really a nice place to dine in and get your poke bowl. The young lady staff very friendly and patient. My light bowl was nicely filled with the essentials and additional topping of spicy smoked almonds- It tasted so good! With specials of 30% off for international poke bowl, my tummy and wallet felt so good too. It is indeed a nice place to enjoy a poke bowl with nice service staff. Hope she keeps up her great attitude:)",

Unfortunately they'd run out on this visit.\nFood delicious but the staff member who served me today firstly completely ignored me for a few minutes before being abrupt and snappy!!! Disappointing as always been lovely on previous visits.",

      "text": "This was our first (and last time) trying Poke Theory, at least at this location. We went to Tanglin Mall specifically for this (lunch time on Jan 4th), as we’ve previously walk past it and wanted to give it a try. A few things:\n\nCons:\n-The 2 gentlemen who worked there seem uninterested and unengaged. They seemed busy with app/takeaway orders.\n-When we got there one of them just starred at us and didn’t even say hi. The first words out of his mouth were “order?” with a slightly annoyed tone.\n-As this was our first time at the restaurant, we had a couple of questions. Again, he continued to seem annoyed by our questions.\n-This is not a restaurant. They have a few tables and chairs but it felt food court like.\n\nPros:\n-portions were a good size\n-there was no one eating there when we went, which was a plus for us as we have 2 young kids who can be loud. I suspect they don’t have many people who actually eat here.\n\nOverall, it’s a decent value but nothing spectacular. The atmosphere, combined with their uninviting and cold staff, made us not want to come back again.",

It’s the first time I’m disgusted.\n\nWent by on Friday 12 July, between 645 - 715pm to get a takeaway.\n\nTo my dismay, I bit onto a plastic piece from my bowl as well as a salmon cube with a bone lodged in it.\n\nUnfortunately this isn’t only a hygiene lapse but also a safety lapse.\n\nOh yes, their staff are rude on a usual basis too.",

I know what it would be an additional $2, but after having the avocado scooped into my bowl, I was then served 1 less topping. Is that how it works??\n2) purchased Shopback voucher multiple times and tried at other outlets (Velocity, NUH, Duo) and no issues, but today the 4-digit PIN wouldn't work?!\nI expect a response regarding this. Have sent a DM via Facebook & Instagram.",
