John Bull,5,"Brighton Montessori HarbourFront has been an amazing experience for my children. The teachers always greet the children warmly in the morning. Very patient and dedicated team of teachers. My children would often chat about their day in school and it's always positive. They have grown so much in confidence, independence and curiosity, thanks to the school's teaching philosophy.

The teachers genuinely care and take the time to update us on our childâ€™s progress, which gives us so much peace of mind. My children have been cared for and nurtured by all the teachers, especially Ms Mandy and Ms Alicia. I also deeply value and grateful for their patience. You couldn't ask for better teachers! Truly a gem of a preschool.

Overall, we couldn't be happier with our choice. Seeing my children excited to go to school every morning speaks volumes about the wonderful work the team at Brighton Montessori HarbourFront is doing. Highly recommend it to any parent looking for a supportive and enriching preschool experience!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112755183608512554766/reviews
