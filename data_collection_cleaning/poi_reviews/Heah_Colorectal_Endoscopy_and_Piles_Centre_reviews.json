However, his techniques are grossly backward and inadequate, leaving his patients with severe pain, trauma and scarring. To add insult to injury, he lacks empathy, along with his staff, as several others have mentioned. Will recommend this clinic only to my very worst enemies.",

Would the problems the patients have be solved? May be. Would the patient feel she is being cared for? Not really.\n\nCondescending would be how I would describe the tone of voice of the doctor. The nurses were more or less ok. The day surgery room was cramped. Very cramped.  When I looked at the photos hung on the walls in the clinic, I understood why. They take pride on their business success rather than their treatment success or patient care.  Every single framed wall hanging was news clipping about the clinic chain as a business. Nothing else. The vibe wasn’t right.",
