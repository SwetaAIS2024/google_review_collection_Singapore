She slurped up the whole cup in a jiffy! üê∂\n\nWe will definitely be back again soon! üëç",

      "text": "I frequent On Pause a little too much for my own good. I was drawn to this place initially as it‚Äôs dog friendly which makes for a good spot to enjoy a nice lunch/breakfast with my dog. Over time, I‚Äôve come to enjoy the food, ambience and the warm service from their team. I have tried a number of their items on the menu and is really fond of their Prawn and Guac tartine. Not sure if their portobello burger is still on the menu but that‚Äôs a good one too. Banana chocolate cake was really tasty too. I only wish that it‚Äôs easier to find a parking spot there!",
