Mark Tho,4,"Still a great place to drink and hangout. Nice and spacious. Played some classic 80s music.

They’ve got decent drink and bottle deals but we still ended up spending $650 with two bottles of gin and heaps of food!

Food was so so and will start with the good… Brussel sprouts and pork cubes were nice.  Bruschetta pizza was actually quite good too. Chicken wings were decent but had better ones. Karaage was more of a chicken cutlet in strips but tasted okay. Wasabi prawns lacked the wasabi flavor. Hokkien Mee lacked wok hey or the char it needs.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108336947993231942478/reviews
Kiran Dave Singh Pannu,5,"Nice bar, well lit in the daytime and cozy at night. Had a pretty good happy hour deal. The food i hearbis pretty good but I didn't try in on this trip",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103380255530740803567/reviews
Drew Esa,5,"After a long walk, my spouse and I stopped in for a beer and some food! We were not wrong with our choice. A huge assortment of beer and good appetizers.
Bar with a good atmosphere and pleasant live music. Very importantly, the burgers here are amazing. The burgers are not very big, but with a thick and juicy patty. Be careful, before 8 pm the price of beer is 3 dollars lower.
The bar has a lot of promotions with alcoholic drinks, look carefully at the screens inside the establishment.
5 points for beer, burgers and live music.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100231074350729929090/reviews
KiDG Music,4,Best Hokkien Mee and Nasi Lemak in Orchard Rd area. Price is on the high side but oh so worth it. Eaten here many times. Beers and other alcoholic drinks pretty decent too if you’re going for the bundle deals.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108038768643376632198/reviews
Han Lee,5,"KPO is always my go to for expensive Hokkien mee! Haha! Thankfully i had entertainer one for one and got a Hokkien mee and brussel sprouts for about $20!

Their brussel sprouts were grilled and marinated perfectly whilst the wok hey of the Hokkien mee is still there!

It’s a place with mainly high chairs as it’s more a drinking and chillax place.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116918025714974988/reviews
