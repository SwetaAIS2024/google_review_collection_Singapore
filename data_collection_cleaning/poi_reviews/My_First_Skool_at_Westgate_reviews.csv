Ain Shah,1,"My husband and I signed up for their showcase which is from 9am to 2pm. We rushed after our night shift work and arrived at 1pm but was dismissed by a staff, stating that they need to wrap up. It was very upsetting. We have also registered our interest last year but received no reply from them. We experienced similar situation at another childcare center but they still accept us graciously even though we came in late. Next time, please state the showcase from 9am to 1pm instead so that we do not have to rush down. Thanks.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117336153554859386429/reviews
Suhaimi Mawasi,1,"I was disappointed with how the centre handled the situation. We had enrolled for the showcase at Westgate centre and were invited to attend between 9am and 2pm. However, when we arrived at 1pm, we were not allowed to enter as the male staff member claimed that they had already wrapped up the session. We explained that the message stated the timing until 2 pm, but the staff member simply said that the last hour is usually for wrapping up and dismissively added, 'Next time, don't be late.' This response left us speechless.

We were disappointed with how the centre planned this event.

- The showcase was stated to be from 9am to 2pm. If the last hour was indeed for wrapping up, why not state the timing as 9am to 1pm instead?
- The staff did not even attempt to check if it was possible to let us have a quick view of the centre.Just dismissed by saying we wrapped up and scaraticly say don't be late next time.Reaching at 1pm is still consider not late.Have some empathy please.

We were looking forward to enrolling our daughter in this centre as this is our 1st choice, but the staff's unaccommodating attitude has left a sour taste in our mouths.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106271853143626993903/reviews
Vivian Ng,1,"I visited the open house on 27 April 2024 and I reached at 1.15pm. There were 2 teachers at the door, and they hesitated to open the door for me when they saw me outside. I told them I’m here for the open house and they said they are closing because they need to sanitize the area. The open house is from 9am to 2pm and at 1.15pm you tell me that you are closing?

I then spoke to the principal C who brushed me aside when I said ‘isn’t this an open house for parents to look at the environment and speak with the teachers, and there are some enrolment perks, as what was marketed?’ There were no teachers whom I can speak to because the principal was wrapping things up. The principal said this event is for existing parents. What???

It was a very bad management of the event. If you don’t wish to get new parents and kids on board, then state so in the first place. Don’t waste our time going down, only to be turned away, by the principal herself.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108243887513026938415/reviews
