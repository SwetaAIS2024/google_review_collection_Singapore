Don't just quote the general health advice of 50 years old! Greenhorn. 2 Nurses at reception said they will help to organise my referral to a colonscopy. They offered but didn't do it. Don't offer to do it, if you aren't do it. I was delayed by 2 weeks because of you receptionists! And i found out I had cancer. This is serious people!",
