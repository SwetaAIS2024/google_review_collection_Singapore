Lishan Lim,5,Been eating this for years and love it! I honestly could eat it daily. It's vegan and the thunder tea formula is superior ðŸ˜Œ CDC vouchers and scan-to-pay accepted too.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104636374666642778780/reviews

Matthias Chua,5,"Located at Bukit Timah Market & Food Centre, stall number #02-188.

Price: $7.00 (Lei Cha Brown Rice)

The ingredients of the Lei Cha (Thunder Tea Rice) includes fried bean curd, sweet chye poh (preserved radish bits), long beans, stir fried cabbage, mani cai (sweet leaf), black eyed pea, toasted peanuts and sesame. Tea soup is basil based and kind of resembles Thai green curry in taste minus the coconut milk.

All the ingredients they used are very fresh and tasted delicious as a whole. The tea soup might seem little at first but the amount given is just right.

Looking forward to trying the Bee Hoon set next time!

Do come support the lesser known dishes in Singapore!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102053521939374349482/reviews
pb,5,"So yummy and wholesome. A bit pricey but worth it. Balanced flavours with generous portions of veggie and taukwa, complete with beans (more protein!) and crunchy peanuts~ requested for thunder tea paste since this was a takeaway, and I added my own water to it. On the saltier side, though I guess this is common, so I added more water to balance out the taste a bit. Still very tasty though. Will be back to try the beehoon :-D",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101588914592684067886/reviews
Honor,5,"Love their yuanyang thunder tea with both the bee hoon and brown rice mixed together. Taste great. I can taste the slight wok flavour from the bee hoon. When mixed together, they both are able to absorb the flavour of the thunder tea. Definitely will come again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100568527139508676317/reviews
