But this time they really disappointed me.\nBought their crispy chicken today and there was one strand of hair stuck in the batter, wanted to let it slide and just threw the piece away, but picked up a second piece to find another strand of hair. Staff was not wearing hair netting. On another occasion, another staff also was flipping his long hair while adding seasonings to my chicken. Very disgusted and ruined my appetite. Called their outlet but no pick up, Had to walk back to the mall to get a refund, what a waste of my time.",

The Food was ok, but the customer service was at least 7 stars and above, the energy level of the cashier was very positive, up selling, promoting products when people walk by and also very polite and friendly,\n\nSo happy to see staff work with passion and a positive attitude.\n\nLet's not forget the guy behind working fast to get the order out. I didn't manage to get anyone names as it was dinner peak period. Didn't want to disturb their work duty.\n\nWell done, give yourself a pat on your back!!!",

      "text": "If every service staff in Singapore is like the full timer aunty, Singapore’s Food and beverage industry is thoroughly doomed. Have seened her many times walking past the stall and patronised many times but was served by the Filipino full timer guy. Today, I ordered two combo sets and I told her that, I couldn’t understand what question she was asking me, so I asked her to repeat herself nicely and yet she lashed out at me impatiently and was very rude. The other Filipino guy offered to serve me but she insisted on getting my order. I had to top up money in my grab account and she just stared at me with a resting b face and said in a demanding tone about the price of my food again. Mind you, I used a very nice tone to talk to her the whole time. Usually I understand that working in this industry is not easy, but the least you can do is to talk to your customers nicely, if not where will the customer retention rate go ? Usually not the type that will write a complaint but this is too much and I hope the management does something to remind the aunty to be nice to the customers considering the amount of people that I have seened complained about her in the reviews here. Peace out bro.",
