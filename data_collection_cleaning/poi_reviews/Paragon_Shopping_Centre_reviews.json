It brings back what festive mood is about as the shops put up their best window dressing that pulls in shoppers into the spirit on spending special gifts for their loved ones. The atmosphere feels warm n happy, bringing joy to anyone who can chill at the several prestige cafes that serve gourmet food n drinks after shopping. That's what life is about during Xmas season . We deserve to enjoy it.",
