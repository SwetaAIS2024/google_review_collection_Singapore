The taste is 100% elevated today because the bananas were green, but I’m biased because I prefer bananas slightly unriped!! I appreciate a good seating place at any acai store, but I feel a little bad because the store was full, and the only table left was a 4 seater. Opps.",

The acai tasted amazing—smooth, flavorful, and perfectly balanced with the ingredients. Everything paired so well together, making it the best acai I’ve had so far.\n\nIf you’re an acai lover, this place is a must-visit. Highly recommended for a satisfying and refreshing treat!",

I still prefer the original default granola tho (30cents top-up), because the new default which is cocoa, i tried a few times and it was always not crunchy in texture.\n\nI have always bought takeaway, first time sitting in and it was a comfortable tea break. Acai bowls were made swiftly and prettily! It was a good break in-between work, will continue to support~",
