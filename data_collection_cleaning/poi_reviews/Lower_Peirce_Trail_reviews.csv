Meng Fai Yip,5,"Went back to explore the various trails as I didn't have the time to do so when I was at the reservoir 3 weeks earlier, and I was certainly not disappointed. O the peace and serenity one could experience if it wasn't so crowded! Would come on a weekday instead of a weekend the next time.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238839349859158213/reviews
JuzChris L.,5,"Awesome hiking place to take a walk along the 900-metre boardwalk. One of the oldest reservoirs in Singapore, previously known as Kalang River Reservoir or Peirce Reservoir, it was renamed Lower Peirce Reservoir. Peace & tranquility with lots of trees (over 100 years old!), flora, ferns & wildlife to observe. Fresh crisp air in the morning great place to get some exercise as well. Put aside 1 to 2hrs for the visit to enjoy the area. Outdoor parking is available less than 40 meters away. Will return again.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100442615697378152802/reviews
WHY Quinn,5,"1 of the more trekking friendly sites in Singapore. Great and decent fun time with friends and family alike. Entire trail is roughly under 4km. There's even a fishing ground for the young and old. I'll definitely recommend everyone to take a hike over here at least once in their lives..!! PS: ""Beware"" of the wild boars, monkeys, chickens and squirrels..!!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109654108843072643671/reviews
Claire Koh,5,"Love how serene this place is. It's an extremely easy trekking option, great even for young children or seniors. In fact, I have seen strollers or people in clutches embarking on the trails here.

Be prepared to see plenty of wildlife here. Over the past walks that I've taken, have seen squirrels, monkeys, chickens, and once or twice, boars and monitor lizards. Harmless though. Also love the trail along the reservoir - can spot tortoises, fishes, and some birds.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113458332503668876344/reviews
foo hean tee,5,"Absolute tranquility if you want an escape from the City.
Also a good place to hone your fishing skills.

The Lower Peirce Reservoir (Chinese: 贝雅士蓄水池下段 Malay: Takungan Air Lower Peirce) is one of the oldest reservoirs in Singapore. It is located near MacRitchie Reservoir and Upper Peirce Reservoir. Previously known as Kallang River Reservoir or Peirce Reservoir, it was renamed Lower Peirce Reservoir after the creation of Upper Peirce Reservoir. It has a surface area of 6 hectares and the surrounding forest contains many trees that are over 100 years old.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105540998881861430540/reviews
