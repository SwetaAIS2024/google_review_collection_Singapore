Faith Sombilla,5,"I stayed at this hotel from May 7–12, 2025, and arrived around 2 a.m. Check-in was smooth, especially since I had filled out the registration form in advance. Even though it was late, the staff were quick to open the door and assist me.

The location is right in the heart of the city—just a 3-minute walk to the metro and 2 minutes to the Chinatown Night Market. If you’re into buying souvenirs for friends and family, Chinatown Point Mall is also nearby, right next to the metro station.

It was my first time staying in a female capsule pod, and overall, it was a good experience. The other guests were respectful and quiet, which made for a peaceful stay. I’m quite particular about cleanliness, especially when it comes to shared toilets and shower rooms, and this hotel exceeded my expectations. The facilities were spotless—I really have no complaints in that area.

Breakfast is simple but convenient, with unlimited bread, spreads, coffee, tea, milk, and chocolate drinks available from 7–10 a.m.

I also want to highlight how accommodating and helpful the staff were. They were always available when needed and spoke excellent English, which made communication easy.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel for solo travelers looking for a clean, safe, and well-located stay in Singapore!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109250497938728414685/reviews
Nathan Jackson,3,"I stayed here for a week when I was visiting the city. The location is super convenient, being really close to the Chinatown MRT station, and also only a couple hundred metres from Maxwell MRT station too.

Getting into the hostel requires steps, which was ok as I didn't have a lot of bags. Slippers are required indoors, and I brought my own as they will not provide them for you and I didn't want to go barefoot inside.

My capsule was a top bunk, which was difficult to get into as there is a large step up to get over the storage lockers, and only one set of stairs was provided per room. The bed was fine, but the AC does not reach into the top bunks making it very stuffy in there with the curtains closed.

The bathrooms were fine, but also got really humid as there is no AC there. The laundry was unavailable which was a massive inconvenience as it cost me $15 SGD to use a laundromat to wash my clothes.

The requirements to wash your own cutlery and plates is silly when only cold tap water is provided, without using the hot water unit. No dishwashing liquid is provided either, just soap.

The breakfast consists of toast and cereal, with instant coffee. I didn't try it at all.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111174749491452591302/reviews
Hannah Jobe,5,"This was my first experience staying in a hostel and it was definitely worth it. The receptionist was helpful to make sure I could find my way around.

I was a little nervous about booking a capsule style hostel because I don’t like small spaces, but the capsule was pleasantly spacious. The room was very quiet and I was able to sleep well, though I missed the eye mask I lost on the plane because I could see the room light over the top of the curtain.

I discovered by accident that it was a street over from the China Town street market with a lot of shopping and food options.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117629297068139486448/reviews
