Bbriner Gaming,5,Fantastic church. Teaching is based in scripture and ties back to the bible. Community is very loving and welcoming albeit a bit too much at times but wonderful genuine people if you get to know them better. Small but very tight-knit church community.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112657382449216484014/reviews
