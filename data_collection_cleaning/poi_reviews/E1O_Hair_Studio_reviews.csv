RQ,5,"I walked in on a Saturday afternoon without an appointment. I wanted a normal wash and blow to help ease my headache. The hair salon was busy with customers. Lucky for me, Leon was available! He was friendly, patient, empathetic and even made sure I wasn't feeling too cold from the air conditioning. The head massage and hair wash were amazing. I felt that I was very well taken care of and I would like to return for other services in the future :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112568332982236045208/reviews

n szna,5,Walked in for a wash cut and blow. I have very thick and wavy hair which takes extra time and steps during the drying part but the male staff was very patient nonetheless. He also offered to perm my hair for the final look. Much appreciation for this and will definitely return!,12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102474754755381956337/reviews
