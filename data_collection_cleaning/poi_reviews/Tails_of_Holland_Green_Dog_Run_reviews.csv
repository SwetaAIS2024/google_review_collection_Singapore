Zag Sim,5,Excellent dog run in terms of space but lacking some basic facilities like a small sheltered area and water point. But still lovely large space for dogs to run free. Parking is also limited to a small corner along the side of the road (park at own risk) as itâ€™s not an official parking area.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116859280922586057509/reviews
Karmen,4,So far so good. Pretty clean. been there 3x so far all 3 times could find dog poo and some other rubbish (an old sharp rusty nail!). guess there will always be owners who don't clean up. ;o( but on the whole still a very nice space for the doggies to run around and play. unshaded so do come at a time when its not so hot. no water points so pls bring your own water.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113787103630937842401/reviews
Puvanesvaran Nadarajoo,4,"Would have been good if there was a water point to wash/get water for the dogs.
Big space for the dogs to run free and have the zoomies. Also for the humans to get some workout done chasing the doggos.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103460475460490919855/reviews
