Adrienne Koh Shu Juan,5,"Food: Chanced upon this quaint bakery while strolling thru and checking out the various shops at Sunway Boulevard 88. Felt very calm and peaceful once you step inside due to it's very zen, minimalist decor which allows their specialty - Japanese-style toasts and buns - stand out. Their signature toast bread comes in full and half loaf sizes while the other flavours are mostly available in half-loaves.

Bought 3 different types to try - pandan, raisin and cranberry and also chocolate. The bread have already been sliced. So it's very convenient to reheat or toast at home. I like the raisin and cranberry version the best as it's a balance of sweetness and tart, which goes very well with butter as well as a hot mug of kopi-O. Their toast bread is really of high quality (since they use imported Japanese flour) and comparable to those I've eaten in Tokyo and Hokkaido.

I also bought their buns, such as the cheesy sausage, garlic pepper sausage and red bean. They are having a promotion now where you buy 3 for RM12. The bread is soft and fluffy while the filling is quite tasty! Will definitely return to try other varieties!

Heard from the staff that they rotate or change some of the flavours of their toasts and buns daily. So it's best if you call them up and check what's available on the day.

Service: The staff is very attentive and friendly. She also let us take some samples of their toasts to try!

Ambiance: Extremely clean and well-maintained space. Take-away concept. This isn't a cafe so there isn't any tables or chairs for you to sit down.

Parking: Plenty of parking (unsheltered) available so not an issue. Parking is free.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100961238865105876649/reviews
