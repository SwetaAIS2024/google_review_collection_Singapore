      "text": "Dr Tho and Nurse Jasmine was great. But I had a beyond terrible experience with Nurse Brenda! Horrifying. If you do not allow patient to place their shorts on the bed, then have the courtesy to politely inform the patient to hang it properly at the side of the bed. You DO NOT snatch the shorts and put it at the side of the bed arm immediately and causing it to fall into the trash bin. And do you expect the patient to be okay with their shorts falling into the trash?! I have never seen such low hygiene standard from a nurse. No apologies from her at all!\n\nAnd when she asked me up on the bed for Dr’s review, it was nothing close to pleasant at all! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!",

I've also seen Dr Tho when I tried to conceive my 2nd baby and successfully conceived. The nurses there were super nice as well. They can remember every single patient name and always reassure me that we are in good hands.\nThank you Dr Tho and nurses!\n\nOne downside, price quite steep.",

My husband and I were very impressed by the way Dr Tho delivered our second child. The delivery process was well guided and the way he delivered the baby was very skillful and meticulous.\nEvery visit to the clinic was enjoyable as his team of nurses were friendly and efficient. The waiting time at the clinic was usually short, around 10-20mins as they strongly encourage patients to make appointment.\nA big thank you to Dr Tho and his team!",
