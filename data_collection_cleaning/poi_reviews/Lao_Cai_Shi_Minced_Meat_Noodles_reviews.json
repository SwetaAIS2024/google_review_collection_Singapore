      "text": "Most Bak Chor Mee are salty, but not this stall. The fishball is springy to the bite and the Mee\nPok ( a commonly used flat noodle for bak chor mee, similar to the tagliatelle ) is evenly coated with sauce that is not salty or MSG laden. The ingredients- IMO is generous for the price. There is usually a long queue starting well before the lunch time rush- so you really cannot give this stall a miss. Let us hope that they‚Äôll maintain their excellent taste.",

Sauce was flavourful too.\n\nIt‚Äôs a pity that this stall (entire Tanglin Halt market) will no longer be around after 1 Aug 2022.",

They had a long line at lunchtime (around 12:30PM) and there was a wait time of 10-15 minutes.\n\nChose the sliced abalone noodle with mee pok. They also serve minced meat and black fungus mushroom along with it.\n\nChili is mild (I prefer stronger). All ingredients are well cooked. Noodles is slurpy and mixes well with the chili. Soup is soothing.",
