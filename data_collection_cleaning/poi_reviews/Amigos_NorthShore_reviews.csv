Jehu Limang,4,"~A review for Amigos Food Stall~
What we had:
1. Chicken Chip with Spaghetti ($10.50)
Visual: 3.5/5
Taste: 4/5
* The black pepper sauce is not like the usual storeâ€‘bought varietyâ€”which was a very pleasant surprise.
The Aglio Olio pasta was decent; weâ€™ve had less satisfying versions elsewhere. It was a bit oily, but thatâ€™s to be expected with this style of dish.
The chicken portion was thick and generous.

To improve: Add a side to the plate at least as the plate looks a bit empty.

2. Chicken Cutlet with Spaghetti ($10.50)
Visual: 4/5
Taste: 4/5
Its a decent size of chicken cutlet, not tough to chew. It is surprising but good that mustard sauce is served with the cutlet, at least its not basic mayonnaise.

To improve: The cutlet is already oily and when served with Agilo Olio which is also an oil based style of pasta, the whole dish felt super oily. It would be nice to offer Chicken cutlet with tomato or cream based pasta. Add more mustard sauce!

3. Guacamole & Salsa Loaded Fries ($4.90)
Visual: 3/5
Taste: 2.5/5

Individually each part (Salsa, Guac and Sour Cream) taste good on its own. Together, not too sure... perhaps someone likes this combo?

To improve: Double fry the fries so that its more crispy. Salsa and Guac should be served separately.  Salsa could be more spicy.

Other:
Service: Unfortunately, the ringer we were given didnâ€™t work, and we only found out our order was ready when the coffeeshop cleaning staff came over to let us know. When we mentioned the issue to the stall employee, he simply took the pager back without offering an apology or acknowledgment. Its not a big problem but do ensure all ringers are in working condition at least.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101381749240099240520/reviews
Mikail Yah,2,Another tenderfresh franchise. But the staff n quality served here is lower than average. There was a bottle of Thai sweet chilli which I wanted to try but was rudely told that it was their secret sauce for one of their dishes. ðŸ¤£.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114771121650386125948/reviews
Irwandy Hassan,1,The food is for human. Kindly rethink on how you pack the food. Other amigos store pack their pasta in plastic container not paper packaging to avoid the sauce from spillage. Don't serve food if you can't respect them.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109389314856056902349/reviews
Almeida,2,"Only if you love cheap processed food. The lower scale of real western food. The Fish Burger came with a pathetic thin frozen deep-fried patty that didn't taste of fish - didn't match the price scale. McDonald's is still way better, and that's the cheapest quality of food in the fast-food chain. Great advertising and Friendly staff tho.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111636210439887082333/reviews
