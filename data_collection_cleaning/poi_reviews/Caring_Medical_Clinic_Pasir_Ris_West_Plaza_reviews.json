      "text": "I started seeing Dr Lee Jing Kun at Woodleigh Family Clinic in February 2024 for my younger son who was frequently falling sick with sore throat and fever. Despite past treatments, his condition persisted affecting his studies during PSLE year. Dr Lee‚Äôs keen diagnostic skills led to an influenza test as¬†my son got H1N1 in December 2024 and the test revealing a faint positive. He assured me antibiotics weren‚Äôt needed and true enough, my son recovered with just fever medication.\n\nWhat truly sets Dr Lee apart is his thoroughness. He identified my son‚Äôs inflamed tonsils as the root cause, advised dietary changes and after two follow ups, my son stopped experiencing monthly fevers and sore throats!\n\nI too became Dr Lee‚Äôs patient due to chronic sinusitis and frequent inflammation. His diagnosis explained my persistent voice blockage something even an ENT specialist overlooked. With his treatment, I‚Äôm now much better.\n\nRecently in Jan 25 when my elder son had an ear infection, I discovered Dr Lee had moved. After just one visit to another clinic, I knew I had to find him. I google¬†his name and realised he is at Caring Medical Clinic in Pasir Ris and didn‚Äôt hesitate to bring my son there. I stay in Woodleigh and the distance is quite far for me, I really don't trust any doctor except Dr Lee¬†üòÖ\n\nDr Lee‚Äôs dedication, compassion and expertise will give me peace of mind and I trust the way he prescribe¬†the medication.Even though my mother-in-law has a regular doctor near Serangoon Gardens, my husband chose to bring her to Dr Lee despite the distance. He insisted on it because her previous doctor wasn‚Äôt thorough enough which led to her being hospitalized.¬†¬†Doctors like Dr Lee are rare. I‚Äôm truly grateful and trust him wholeheartedly with my family‚Äôs health.\n\nP.s I will be visiting Dr Lee to do power of attorney for my family. Thank you, Dr Lee, you are a genuine doctor that will go beyond!",

As a result of this , I realised that there were presence of gallstones in my gallbladder. Dr. Lee advised me to have my gallbladder removed by specialists that he recommended. Dr. Lee took the time to explain to me the whole process. I had my gallbladder removed this week. Thank you Dr. Lee.",
