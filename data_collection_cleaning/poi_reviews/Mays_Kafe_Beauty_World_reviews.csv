Pink,5,"As a huge Ya Kun fan, I have to say May Cafe really takes it up a notch! ðŸ”¥ Every item hits the spot â€” the kopi C kosong is super gao and satisfyingâ˜• The toast is crispy, slightly thicker than Ya Kunâ€™s, and generously slathered with peanut butter. ðŸ¥œ The soft-boiled eggs are right up to Ya Kunâ€™s standard too (just look at the photo). Friendly staff as well. Definitely a new favorite place for my local breakfast fix! ðŸ¥°",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106676850203418382963/reviews

Supriya Vivek Anand,5,"Super causal place for a quick small meal. Tried for the first time today and definitely not disappointed. Ordered a lemon juice and sourdough bread with butter and honey. The bread was not chewy and was toasted to perfection. The lemon juice was refreshing and just what I needed on a sultry afternoon. self collect style but their service was efficient and I got my bread in less than 10 minutes . Most tables were taken but I was lucky to find one with a single seat.  Overall it was satisfying and reasonably priced.
Eager to try their coffees the next time.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101089941005596564557/reviews

oXRYSTALo Ong,3,"Alright, folks, listen up! Donkey and I were on a cycling trip to Albert Complex for a movie at the Eagle Cineplex, and with a hot afternoon approaching, we decided to skip the hawker centers and head to Beauty World for a quick bite. Donkey remembered a delicious coffee from a previous visit to Beauty World, so he was eager to revisit May's Kafe.

The Good:

â€¢ The Coffee: The coffee, however, lived up to Donkey's memory! It still had that incredible fragrance he remembers from two years ago.

â€¢ The Atmosphere: May's Kafe has a lively atmosphere, and it's nice to sit in the open at Basement 1.

The Quirks:

â€¢ The Food: We found a table, and Donkey ordered the Mee Rebus while I tried the Mee Siam, which is their recommended dish. The Mee Rebus was acceptable, but I felt that the Mee Siam was a bit lacking compared to other Mee Siams I had before. We also couldn't resist adding a chee cheong fun and an Orh kueh to our order. I told Donkey that I really enjoyed them on my last visit, but this time, I felt the quality had dropped a bit.

â€¢ The Tea: The tea, unfortunately, was a bit lacking in flavor.

â€¢ The Service: There's no table service, so after ordering, you have to collect your food and return your tray yourself.

Donkeyâ€™s Note: I loved the coffee! It was so good!

My Note: I was hoping for a more flavorful Mee Siam, but the coffee was still amazing!

Rating:

â€¢ Food: 3/5 (Some dishes were underwhelming, but others were good)

â€¢ Service: 3.5/5 (No table service, but efficient)

â€¢ Atmosphere: 4/5 (Lively and bustling)

Overall: 3.5/5

Overall: While some dishes were a bit underwhelming, May's Kafe is still a good option for a quick and affordable meal. Their coffee, especially, is a real highlight.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews
