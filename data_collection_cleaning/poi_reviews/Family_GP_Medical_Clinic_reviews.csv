M L,5,"I had a very unpleasant and excruciatingly painful experience in my abdomen at night after dinner. I could not move with so much pain and had slumped to the floor. Started contacting several 24hr house visit doctors. None picked up my calls except Dr Chua (see photo) 'The Mobile Doctor' thankfully. It was past 2300 hours. He was very patient and assessed my condition carefully. Despite my agony, his voice gave me a sense of calm as he went through my health condition step by step and gave his views on the current meds I was taking (for other health conditions) so as to narrow down what was wrong with me. As I had already taken different types of painkillers from Buscopan to Arcoxia to Cellebrex to relieve the pain, I was concerned with OD. I think he managed to pin point the cause and advised me accordingly over the phone on what further meds I can or cannot take to avoid overdosing. Upon taking his medical advice, my pain subsided significantly. I know there are good doctors out there but Dr Chua is one hellavu doctor. He should be nicknamed Singapore's ""DOCTOR HOUSE"" after the hit American TV series. Thank you Doctor Chua. Your contact number is now on my speed dial!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100381364985379544016/reviews

SY Wong,5,"We just moved to Pasir Ris and had to look for a new clinic. Reviews of other clnics around our area are really poor except this clinic. My mum went for consultation, and Dr Chua attended to her. It was a very good experience and she got to learn about different health schemes from Dr Chua, which our previous doc at Kallang T medical did not inform at all. Dr Chua is attentive to patients and its a great clinic! Convenient location too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103531352104428809669/reviews
Louis Tp,5,"I visited Dr. Chua at his new clinic located within the ""Seastrand"" condo along Pasir Ris Drive 3 recently because it's very near where I live. Dr. Chua is professional and very approachable, and most importantly his prescription worked for me. My wife visited him today and she shared the same opinion. We are glad to have a friendly clinic operating within our vicinity.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109869654237903039426/reviews
