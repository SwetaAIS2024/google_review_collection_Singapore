CK C,5,"Environment was cosy while staff were welcoming and attentive. For the price, food quality and quantity was great. Draft beers at less than $8++ per pint. This place deserves higher ratings and patronage.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
TOON XUAN POH,5,"Nice & chill atmosphere with a variety of mouth-watering food options!! Not many people on a weekday night but the vibes were still great with friendly staff :) Was craving chilli crab and was elated to see that they have chilli crab pasta ($24) on the menu! Tasty and spicy chilli crab sauce with juicy clam and prawns, didn't disappoint at all üòã would have liked to have a bit more ingredients in the pasta though~

Also tried the crispy snapper burger ($20), the fish was soft and the buttered buns were even softer! Came with a side of crispy and fragrant truffle fries too, loved it!

Had a hourly happy hour deal going on, got a delicious draught black cab pint for $6.99 üëçüèª",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112088356968936863986/reviews
qingxian qiu,5,One of the better fish and chip I have tried. The snapper is juicy and the seasoning goes well with the citrus mayonnaise. The crabmeat croquette is average though. Friendly staff and retro ambience üôÇ,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110218215668875336608/reviews
