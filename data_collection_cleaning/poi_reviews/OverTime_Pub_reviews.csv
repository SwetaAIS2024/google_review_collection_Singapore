Thomas Castrique (talnilam),1,"We stayed here with my friend to expect singing for fun, we bought beers that are super expensive and waited 1h30 with no possibility to sing because many songs were registered before. Some people arrived 1h after us and had their songs coming up before ours because their table number was before our number. What a waste of time and money.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106252470184182381998/reviews

Sarah Moylan,5,"Had a top 5 night of my life here doing karaoke with friends. This is a dive bar where the regulars (or so they seemed to me) have incredible singing voices. It's like something out of a movie, and a nice antidote to the slickness you find elsewhere in Singapore. I would give it 10 stars if I could.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102632340523393952213/reviews
