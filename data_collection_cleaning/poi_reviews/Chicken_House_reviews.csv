Grace Tan,1,Stall charged close to six dollars for a pack of chicken rice with only a few pieces of chicken. Nicer ones nearby like boon tong Kee,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106804530717629912180/reviews
Michelin Inspector,5,This store sells kampong (free-range) chicken which are less fatty (thus healthier) and so delicious. The chicken has the lttle jelly layer  underneath the skin. üêî üê•,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108167496990200967081/reviews
Zhihan Yeo,5,"Really good chicken rice here. Popular stall in the area.

Appreciated that the soy seasoning was light which allowed the natural flavours of the kampong chicken to shine. Chicken was smooth but retained a good bite, not falling apart tender.

The rice was fluffy and aromatic with a clean chicken stock flavour without being oily. The soup was the same, not just msg water.

Chili was fresh, like a puree. Not cutting corners with the watery stuff.

Only small negative was that beansprouts ($5) were a  bit overcooked for my taste. Prefer them slightly crunchy.

The coffee shop was small but airy, only half full on a Sat 11.30am. A lot of people buying takeaway too tho.

Paid $19.50 for 2 pax portion, 2 rice and beansprouts. Not the cheapest but worth the quality in my view.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103174476340728593654/reviews
MNG,5,"Excellent chicken rice offering kampung version. The bird is on a smaller size as compared to farm bred ones. Its color is of a distinct yellow hue.

Its meat is tender enough and provided a good bite. The flavor of the chicken was evident.

Rice is mildly fragrant of chicken oil and stock.

Minced chili, ginger, black soy and a light soy mix to dress the chicken.
All of these are flavorful and went well as a whole.

Highly recommended.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
Lynn,5,"Greaaaat place to dine! I am a big fan of chicken rice, and this is almost (one of) the best chicken rice spots in my mind.

The taste is really good, very similar to another famous chicken house in Outram Park, but cheaper and (for me) closer.

Asked for one portion of breast and one thigh, $10.5 together served with rice and soup. Kailan for another $4.

The vibe is so relaxing during the day time, with breezy wind and sufficient sunlight. Feel delighted enjoying my meal :) Tables are clean too.

Definitely will recommend to everyone ü•∞",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107558088171068925224/reviews
