      "text": "I 1st met Dr. Daniel Tan Jiadong on 11 Dec 2024 at Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic. Being a new care-giver, I have to ensure my health is in good condition and upon hearing I have some issues, he has patiently checked and explained it well to clear my concern/fear. Hence discussion and suggestion were recommended and met. 3 months later, my visit with him is equally a pleasant one. I am really glad to have met him who is polite, understanding and is open for discussions and is very accomodating too. Taking this opportunity,  I would like to wish him great success in his career. Kudos to him. He makes a good doctor. Keep up it!",

      "text": "Unthoughtful queuing system\n1) If you missed the “temperature” queue, your Q number is not displayed under “missed queue” display screen. And the staff there also don’t bother to call out the missed queue number. Until the patients who came before me already seen a doctor and I still did not. Went to check with the temperature checking staff then she say, “ I already called your number, you missed it”.\n2) Both kiosks for medication collection are hidden behind some walls, and unless you specifically walk around to find it. Its is hardly noticeable. On the day, both kiosks were spoiled. There’s a small card on the screen that says go to the reception. Again, if you are not a “regular” in AMK polyclinic. You are going to miss it and waste your time waiting for your queue number to be called.",
