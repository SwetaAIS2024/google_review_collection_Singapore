The fish and chip was nice except would prefer a firmer type of fish meat. Staff were friendly and atmosphere cozy. Would recommend to give it a try if you happen to go be around this area if you never try before.",

Today, I noticed my usual Unagi Don seemed a little smaller than usual, so I gave some feedback to the staff. I was really impressed by how seriously they took it , they listened sincerely, conveyed it to the chef right away, and even offered a small replacement along with a warm apology.\n\nTheir genuine care for customer feedback and excellent service truly stands out. It’s this kind of thoughtfulness that keeps us coming back. Highly recommended!",

Only thing is they dont accept credit card so do take note!\n\nWill definitely dine here if im running errands around this area!",
