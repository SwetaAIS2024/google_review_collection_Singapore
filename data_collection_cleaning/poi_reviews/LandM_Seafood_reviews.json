Smell was bad when I opened fish from the plastic wrap. I paid for it S$45. Shouldn't cook not fresh fish for customer. Everything else that ordered was okay taste-wise.",

Revisited with their honey chicken rice and again did not disappoint me at all. Super juicy and fulfilling and planning to head back to try the remaining menu dishes. The cashier might be a little cold and unresponsive but the food makes up for all of it.",

      "text": "When I went down to place my dinner order on March 20th, the man at the counter appeared really confused. He works in that restaurant and appeared to be confused by the variety of foods. It was made clear that I wanted my bee hoon to have sambal added and to be spicy. After waiting for 25 minutes, they packed my food and delivered it; however, when we got home, we noticed everything was a mess. Chicken with prawn paste was cooked horribly. The chicken within was blooded and a little cold. The chicken was hiding inside because there was too much flour. For Bee hoon I informed him that I wanted sambal,but he failed to inform the cook. Last night, I observed them preparing a meal for the neighbor's Tender best staff.The food looked good enough to eat,but why is it so bad when you prepare Food for your customers? I just have to wonder if you and your workers will eat the garbage you prepared for us or others. If you can't deliver what your customer requests, you should probably stop. The seafood shop that isn't halal certified can still deliver food to their customers' requests. Carry halal certified and delivery garbage food.",
