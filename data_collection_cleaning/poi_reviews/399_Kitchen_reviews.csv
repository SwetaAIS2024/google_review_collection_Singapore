GoAheadGroupFan,5,"On Friday 27 December 2024, I had black pepper chicken with rice for my lunch at the 399 food court at Taman Jurong Shopping Centre, and I liked this meal as the black pepper chicken with rice tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these other delightful dishes from this outlet (except pork and beef) in the future.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105877449322822053371/reviews
