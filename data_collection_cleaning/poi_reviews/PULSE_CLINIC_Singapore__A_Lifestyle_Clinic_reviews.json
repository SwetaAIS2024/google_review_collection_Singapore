      "text": "My son, Adiy recently underwent circumcision surgery and I wanted to share my experience to help others who may be considering the procedure.\n\nThe actual surgery itself doesn't went smoothly as Adiy was terrified upon entering the room, but I was pleasantly surprised by how quick Dr Taufiq and his his team handled and convinced Adiy to undergo the procedure. The medical team made sure to keep Adiy comfortable and informed throughout the entire process, which helped alleviate any anxiety Adiy had about the surgery.\n\nAfter the surgery, Adiy experienced some discomfort and swelling, which is to be expected. However, with proper pain management and following the aftercare instructions provided by Dr Taufiq, the recovery process was manageable.\n\nIt’s important to note that everyone’s experience with circumcision surgery will be different, and it’s crucial to follow your doctor’s advice and attend follow-up appointments to ensure proper healing.\n\nOverall, I’m pleased with Dr Taufiq circumcision surgery procedure, and I’m grateful for the support and care I've received from Dr Taufiq. If you’re considering the procedure, I encourage you to thoroughly research and speak with a healthcare professional to determine if it’s the right choice for you.",
