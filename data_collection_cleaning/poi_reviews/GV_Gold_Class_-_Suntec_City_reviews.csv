Melissa Koh,2,"They sold us dining vouchers without an expiry date less than 6 months ago and now when we returned they said it’s no longer valid, I think that’s quite unethical. Apart from that disappointment we enjoyed our movie. Beef cheeks was yummy, service was efficient. We ordered our food when we waited at the lounge to be served in the theatre. Food was promptly served before the movie started. However they came to our seat for payment some time after the movie has started, which interrupted us. When we ordered they told us that payment is done after the movie so that was surprising.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100919442873272512121/reviews

Sky,4,"For the experience , the tickets are definitely pricey . Otherwise , seats are comfortable and service are good . Maybe management should also review  the French Fries & Popcorn Combo package which comes at $25/pax. For 2 pax, it’s $50 basically eating just fries and popcorn. More worthwhile ordering other food (eg chicken wings) packages though.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100770304576606473090/reviews
La Madame NomNom,4,"Usual weekend activities. Basic items included i.e. bottled water, cookie pack and a small thin blanket. Seats are comfortable but do check between the fold of the recliner footrest. There's once my leg got smeared with ketchup that was left by previous patron. The service staff help me clean up the seat.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118395200523287063467/reviews
