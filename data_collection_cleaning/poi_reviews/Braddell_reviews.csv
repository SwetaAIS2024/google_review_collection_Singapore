sunny,1,"if i could give a 0 star review, i 100% will.
malay mrt staff on ground at 12.15pm on 10/05/2025 was so rude. i asked for ezlink card purchase and ask if can pay by card and he told me cash only. he told me can use my bank card and i said its not working then he ask me call the bank. i then told him how to call if i want to get on the train now???? he told me “like i said, use ur bank card and withdraw money from atm” i said i have no card because i didn’t bring my wallet and he rudely raised his voice and said “LIKE I SAID, go to the atm to withdraw money” this whole experience made me think that mrt staffs truly does not care about your feelings. if you hate working for customer service, then i suggest you find another job. other than that, he was using his phone at the counter and was not doing work. how is this behaviour allowed? please terminate staffs who are not doing their job. i was never rude and all i did was ask him nicely. so what makes him think that he can raise my voice as a front desk customer service personal? i am really disappointed in the service so in conclusion, i rate it a 0/5.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101009057133788382240/reviews

BILLION RONALD,2,"The security officer insisted that I can't use the wide gentry as it is a priority for disabled. Then SMRT must station a SO Strictly to guard the wide gentry to prevent ordinary passengers from using 24/7. Why other ordinary passengers can use, why can't I? I was carrying a big back pack and another bag. Thinking that it's more convinent to use the wide gentry. He kept insisting that it's priority for handicap. I am a resident living in Lorong one for past 60 yrs and have been using Braddell Station since it's inception.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111148604618308997882/reviews
Thaddeus “I’m OK You’re OK” Ang,2,"It is high time that SMRT renovate this station, the ceiling is run down and leaking!!! The worst aspect of this station is there is no escalator descending or lift in EXIT C？Maybe SMRT IS waiting for elderly to fall down the stairs then they’ll consider fixing iT!!
Don’t fix until it’s broken!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115908654766704157792/reviews
