Janet Tan,5,"We walked in around 745pm on Friday night. The vongole is a MUST ORDER. It was so good that we had a second order.

The 4 cheese pizza and truffle ham pizza were also very nice. Mushroom soup was gone in seconds.

What is amazing is the hospitality. The Manager, Alessandro chatted with us and shared that almost everything in the restaurant is from Italy. From the flour to the sauces and also the chef! Chef Andre (hope I got the spelling right) even came by to say hi.

Alessandro also gave us Italian Liqueur to try. It tasted nice, sweet almond taste.

Will definitely come again!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102035391100643490540/reviews
Tim Lim,5,"Had a great experience at Etna, been here several times. Consistently good. Attentive Service by Alessandro and other servers, who took time to chat with us and attend to our needs. Especially enjoyed the Lamb Tagliatelle, and the salt crusted Mediterranean sea bass. Pizza was also on point. Topped off with a birthday ice cream!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100225108943919916460/reviews
Jillian Marie,5,"Went here for my birthday and had the best time! The food was delicious and beautifully presented, but what really stood out was the amazing service. Pearl took such great care of us—she was friendly, thoughtful, and really made the night feel special. They even added a lovely touch to our cake that made the celebration extra memorable.

Aane Nakashima,5,Had some pizza and pasta at this restaurant and it was really nice. Ordered couple pizzas and all of them were perfectly prepared. And each pasta was very flavorful. This might be common in some of the restaurants in the area but a bottle of water costs $8 so wish they indicated the price if it's not from the menu.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117153265914946443572/reviews
