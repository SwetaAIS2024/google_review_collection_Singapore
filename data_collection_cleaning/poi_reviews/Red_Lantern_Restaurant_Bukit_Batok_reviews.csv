Vin W,5,"We had the set dinner which was reasonably priced at $98 for 5 pax.
All the dishes were delicious and varied.
The set also included dessert was a pleasant surprise.
Worth to mention that it is also a unique and airy dining experience at the void deck",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109263427873687540100/reviews
Suha Sapphire,5,One of the really good neighbourhood Zo Char places. Chye Poh Tofu was super nice and would definitely recommend! The prawn paste chicken was so good I order it everytime I visit this place! The sweet potato leaves sambal was also really good! Would patronise myself multiple times. Super delicious and really a must try!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115842561100057581382/reviews
N Y,5,"Had some nice zhi char food from Red Lantern to usher in the new year. A visibly popular spot where seats were sprouted beyond the restaurant vicinity and big family crowds could be seen patronizing. Their signature tofu was the highlight, soft, layered and flavorful. Otherwise dishes were good too, will recommend.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105633440650460007544/reviews
CY Koh,3,"Food was merely adequate, tasted one dimensional. Lala soup and grilled squid were decent and plentiful. Golden finger chicken, the recommended dish, was disappointing to say the least, looked nothing like the photo and tasted like black soy sauce chicken wing.

At least the seating area was not warm compared to the weather even without air-conditioning. Service was ok.

Food quality not appealing enough to want to revisit again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115175315726873558317/reviews
leong gee chun,5,"This is an excellent spot for gatherings with family and friends, offering delicious food at great value. Our group of five enjoyed 7-8 dishes, all for just $116, making it well worth the experience. Will Come again üòÅ",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102364345867392883297/reviews
