kiyo Chi,1,"The Chinese lady is really rude and cranky , I just simply asking nicely with smile for boneless chicken and she start show me her temple , she replied : don’t need say so many time s! I heard you ! And question me by staring me and saying: no need keep asking ! can’t you see I prepared ?
Why so rude ?
How I know which one is my food? Can’t I double confirm meh ?

QqY,4,"Just tabao back home.  The rice and chicken is good.  Only the chilli i feel not shiok enough,  need a bit more improvement. Price is also not very cheap at $5.60 + $0.30 to go.
Want soup , just add on $0.30 for the take away box.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110502466215741043440/reviews
