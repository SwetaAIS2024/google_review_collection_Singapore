Subsequently she screamed and shouted you not happy go to coffeeshop and don't come here to buy. She is really sick. Hope I can meet the management and speak. She just embarrassed me early in the morning. Such a rude and rowdy behavior. I just pity her family members. I will never patronize here anymore. Definitely will report to the authorities. It's kinda of racism towards me.",
