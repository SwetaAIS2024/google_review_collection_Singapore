Most importantly reasonably priced at 70 cts per stick which is rare nowadays. Will revisit definitely if I yearned for satay.",

Uncle was nice and friendly after u get to know him better. Be prepared to wait during weekends unless you pre-order in advance. Will continue to support him whenever I'm near the vicinity ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèª",
