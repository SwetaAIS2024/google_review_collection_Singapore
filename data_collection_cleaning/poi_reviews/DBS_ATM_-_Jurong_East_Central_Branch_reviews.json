Even if there's no signs of any elderlies in the queue or inside the bank, they're not flexible enough to let you in. It is due to covid, they put up a safe hour for the elderlies.\n\nI got it if there's any elderly around, they should be prioritised first but was there a need to reject a younger customer even when it's empty inside and outside. Fking disappointed. They could have done better but the guy seems like a lazy mofo.",
