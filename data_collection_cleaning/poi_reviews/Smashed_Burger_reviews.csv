Viel Sha,5,Fries was so crunchy and thick. We order classic burger and I forget the other one but it was a new menu with full of sauce and rich of spices . Both of it was delicious! And also their limited drinks was amazing ! Unfortunately we drink without ice added . It will absolutely taste better with ice.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109911866496197395221/reviews
Yong Yi,3,"Probably my favorite part of the burger is the bun, it’s huge, glazed & soft. I only wished it was toasted on the inside.
The patties are alright, what I expect smashed burger patties to be. The burger sauce for me is too much which made it more jelak than it needed to be.

The interior of the shop doesn’t suit any form of dining in/waiting in line as it’s just too narrow & humid in there.
I would recommend ordering and coming back later to the shop to collect rather than linger in there.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115956441745196423077/reviews
Rei yoshida,5,Today for dinner I went to this place and oh my lord it was good. I got the house burger with the special sauce which was absolutely amazing and the beef was juicy and flavourful. The bun was soft and the pickles and onions fitted perfectly with the salty a d juicy beef. Definitely worth a try and definitely coming back. Also the fries were crispy and salty with a good fries seasoning. The service was amazing and they gave us a free burger since they had some extra beef and ingredients. Definitely coming back and brining my friends here🍔🍔🍟🍟👍👍👌👌,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117969606083274477952/reviews
Eric Leong (Eric),3,"We went there for lunch.

Atmosphere - Definitely not a great place for hot sunny afternoon . It is more to a standing table kind and the environment is quite hot during the sunny afternoon.

Food - average. The meat patty is doesnt hold well together. Feels like the bun not well toasted.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112887589799911935206/reviews
Farid Cooper,4,"The smashed burgers are really good and delicious. Beef patty are nice and juicy.

Would be nice if there's seating area provided, but there's tall tables right outside",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110151127984154353187/reviews
