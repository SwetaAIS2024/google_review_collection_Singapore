      "text": "Tucked away in one corner of Lower Seletar Reservoir near the Yishun Dam, Rower's Bay Park is a hidden gem that ought not to be missed. Quite a number of people come here for fishing in the morning, and it is the place from where we can check out Yishun Dam itself and Seletar Fishing Village with its four jetties. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to go in to explore the Fishing Village. But standing in the middle of Yishun Dam and facing the Straits of Johor, we were able to see one of the four jetties of the village - the leftmost jetty called Jenal Jetty.\n\nBy the way, in case you're wondering what the pink substance near the shoreline of the park is, they are the pink-colored eggs of golden apple snails.",

If the weather is good, that's one of the best place to photograph the sunset! I advise to arrive before 5:45pm. Then you can take a nice place to see the sunset because there are quite a lot of people if you arrive too late.",
