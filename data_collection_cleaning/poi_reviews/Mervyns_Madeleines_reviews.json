      "text": "Hidden gem near Clementi 💎\nWe ordered the carbonara, nasi lemak, mango smoothie and strawberry passion fruit juice. All hits no misses 💯\nThe pasta was perfectly cooked and v evenly coated and the bits of bacon was so tasty! Mango smoothie tasted very nice and natural (no added sugar)\n\nThe madeleines are baked on the spot! So delish.\n\nPrices were very reasonable too, definitely coming back.\n\nParked outside ridgewood condo and had to pass a gate and walk down stairs to find the shop near the pool. It’s a small casual outfit with 3-4 tables and no AC but breezy",

      "text": "Got their carbonara and basil pesto pasta, along with milk chocolate cookie and mushroom croquettes. Honestly, I find the food amazing - pasta was al dente, cookie was buttery fragrant and even their mushroom croquettes, containing diced mushrooms in cream sauce, taste great despite myself not being too big of a mushroom fan. The downside is that the location is weird - inside a condo and not super easily accessible, also there's a lack of fans in the dining area so it can get rather hot in the afternoon. But otherwise this place definitely deserves a visit.\n\nIt's a little high price-wise but they do have lunch deals which makes it more value-for-money.\n\nLastly, the owner, Mervyn, is really friendly too and service-oriented so that's a big plus.",

Those who stay near the area may know them when they were there in 2022 😊\n\nWhat we had\n\n🍝 𝐒𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐝 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐢𝐧𝐞, $𝟏𝟔 ⭐️\nTomato-based pasta that is well coated and flavourful. Opted for spicy version for some spicy kick. The squid is also nicely cooked and not too rubbery\n\n🍝 𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐑𝐚𝐠𝐮, $𝟏𝟔\nPasta cooked with extra virgin olive oil and topped with slow-braised red wine pork ragu that is well marinated. Opted for spicy version here for more flavour\n\n🍅 𝐁𝐞𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐭 𝐓𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐨 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐝, $𝟖 ⭐️\nRoasted beets and diced tomatoes served with tangy balsamic mayonnaise dressing. @samlivestoeat who is not a fan of beets found this nice so that says a lot 😜\n\nPastries\n🌟 𝐂𝐢𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐬 𝐌𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬 (𝟓 𝐩𝐜𝐬), $𝟔 ⭐️\n🌟 𝐀𝐥𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐫𝐬 (𝟏𝟎 𝐩𝐜𝐬), $𝟖\n\nLimited quantities available daily so better to make a reservation in advance before heading down. The citrus madeleines are crispy around the edges and not too dry on the inside. They are also pretty buttery with a hint of citrusy flavour. The financiers on the other hand are also crispy & buttery but we prefer them to be more fluffy and less dense\n\nDrinks\n🥭 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐨 𝐒𝐦𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐞 𝐰 𝐘𝐨𝐠𝐡𝐮𝐫𝐭 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐬, $𝟔.𝟓𝟎\n🍓 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐰𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐏𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭 𝐉𝐮𝐢𝐜𝐞, $𝟔\n\nThe mango smoothie is not too sweet and the yoghurt balls are pretty refreshing with a slight tang. The strawberry passionfruit is on the tangier side but still refreshing\n\nFor more food reviews, follow me on\nIG: @dtfoodaffair :)",
