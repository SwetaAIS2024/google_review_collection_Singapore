Stephanie Tang,1,"Cash Studio Cuppage Plaza Hi, I have patronised your outlet several times and everytime one of your staff, short hair skinny middle age lady keeps telling me I can pay for the 2 hours and get free one hour promo and I can sing unlimited timing… if I oversing who knows they will charge me a hefty sum.. what kind of business practise is this? Very unprofessional… please look into this matter who knows this staff of yours has been abusing her authority in your company and has cause losses to your company and unpleasant customer experience!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101657052161879920924/reviews

Shou兽,1,"Not recommend to come here. System sucks, service sucks. Especially the lady (seems like aged 40+) very arrogant attitude. just bcoz asked twice of the price and hours she asked me back: I've told u just now right its 3 hours , I've told u just now right it's 27++ per pax' Hello that was the second time I asked, u can just answered me again but why must said 'I've told u right' in front of the sentences? and also when we reached there, before the guy bring us to the room, my frd wanted to ask for more info, again this lady told her 'just follow him he will tell u ' with an impatient face and tone. IF you were not happy on that day or you don't like your job maybe you can resign or reposition, since you are at the counter, you are to serve every walk in customers and answer the phone politely! One last thing to comment, the system very sucks. poor speaker and mic, not much new songs. I would never ever go back this karaoke",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100564639776668827379/reviews
Tommy Dong,4,"Good package on weekends that it count per pax instead of the usual per hour and the place feels very hip and comfortable. Service and ancillary service provided such as blankets and free flow drinks are well served. Just that the only few types of free flow drinks aren’t that well indicated on the pamphlet and making people confused as to which drink is free flow.

But overall room condition is good, wide variety of songs available and the sound quality is good too",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100544347172760686208/reviews
