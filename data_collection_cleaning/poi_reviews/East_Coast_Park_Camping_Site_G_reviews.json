      "text": "Great location for overnight camping. It has beach view and nice garden. However because Changi Airport is nearby so there is very loud noise from planes, so better bring earplugs. You can bring your own tent or book glamping from one of the companies. Bring your drinks, food, speaker and games and you will have a great time. There are good restaurants nearby with amazing food.",

Kids can easily go to beach and have fun flying kite as well. The only bad thing is not so near to any eatery or food stall. Can still grab or bring your own food to cook/heat up in discreet.",
