Angie from Delegance was very professional from the beginning to the end and advised me alot of how to keep the excess fats away so I can look better in clothes. No hard selling.

Alicia Lim,5,"First-timer experience and I bought long girdles, vest and corset from Dâ€™Elegance. Highly recommend their products for anyone looking for a blend of comfort and classic beauty!

The girdle is incredibly comfortable and shapes my waist beautifully without feeling too tight or restrictive. The material feels luxurious, and the craftsmanship is top-notch, offering both support and style. What I love most is how the products can be combined seamlessly to enhance my posture, giving me an elegant, hourglass silhouette.

Also a shout out to Angie who was extremely professional and knowledgeable throughout the entire consultation, she was spot-on about my sizes and very patient with my questions. Thank you very much for the kindness and support!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100141428476798313945/reviews
