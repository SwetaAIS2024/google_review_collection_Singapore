      "text": "I ordered the matcha and red bean pancake and latte. The presentation of the food was beautiful (insta worthy) however, the pancakes are 80% cooked. This is known from the outset. After eating the pancakes, I got a tummy ache for a good while. Therefore, if you can't stomach food which is 80% cooked, this place isn't for you. I did not enjoy the texture much either. I felt like some parts were well cooked and I could taste batter in other portions. Since it is cooked 80%, takeaways are not allowed. My friend ate the mixed berry pancake and he really liked it. He did not get a tummy ache so it just depends. Service was fine. The atmosphere is also good. The cooking style didn't sit right with my stomach unfortunately. Taste wise, the pancake was nice (apart from the uncooked batter).",
