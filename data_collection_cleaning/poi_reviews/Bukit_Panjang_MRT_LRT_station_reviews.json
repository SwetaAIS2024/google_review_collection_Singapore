      "text": "Bukit Panjang MRT/LRT station\nThe mrt is just beside Hillion Mall the shopping mall in Bukit Panjang is the West of Singapore.  Together with the Hillion Residences condominium that sits above the mall, the property is integrated with the Bukit Panjang bus interchange and LRT and MRT stations. According to the website of Sim Lian Group who is the developer of the project, the mall has 240,000 sq ft of gross floor area and more than 100 retail shops spread over 4 levels.   We don’t like to shop but we love to eat, so what we were really interested in is what to eat at Hillion Mall.  We took a quick tour and compiled a list of the Hillion Mall Food Places and Restaurants.  This is not a complete list as there could be some that we missed out – we suggest you refer to the official tenant directory at Hillion Mall for a full list of shops and restaurants.",

Having already only one way during off peak hours for repair works since 2019, yet we are still experiencing delays during the peak hours now in 2023. It doesn't make sense to take almost 30mins to get from Segar LRT to Bukit Panjang LRT. It's not even an one time off event. It's consecutive days/weeks. We should be moving forward with time, not deteriorate as time passes. Please buck up. Do deploy buses if required.",
