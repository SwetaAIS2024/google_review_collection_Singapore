Felix,1,"Extremely rude staff from FITSA. Encountered a very rude and arrogant Instructor, made a complaint through Facebook, contact form and email. I get no replies at all and no action has been taken. It seems to me that FITSA simply does not care about professionalism of their staff nor trying to improve their services at all. Definitely not recommended",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100104552134542993321/reviews
