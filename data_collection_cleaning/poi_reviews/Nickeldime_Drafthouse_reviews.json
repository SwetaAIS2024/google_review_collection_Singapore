      "text": "I find the fish and chips quality unfortunately, did not meet my expectations for the price I paid. The fish portion was small and tasted mostly like just cooking oil. The fries were soggy and lacked flavor, while the pasta was decent but not outstanding. To add to the disappointment, the craft beer prices were also high. In total, we spent $80 on the meal, and to make matters worse, we were the only customers on a Saturday night, which was surprising. Overall, the experience was underwhelming considering the cost and lack of ambiance.",

Did not get the chance to try their pizza though.. the garlic fries is heavenly!! And they go well with craft beer!",

Like the salad side as well which helps to balance the jelatness.\n\nThey have a range of alcohol to choose from on the chalkboard (not on their menu).",

Just that it may be a tad too salty for some individuals. This place also has screens that shows soccer matches, and friendly staffs that'll assist you on the type of beers that you may be more accustomed to. Easy to have a conversation with your friends as the music here isn't too loud.",
