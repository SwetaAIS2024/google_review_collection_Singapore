Lina Lim,3,"Prepacked mala cold dishes. Not very fascinating.

Mala scallop is not bad. Member has discount. $7plus a box (original price $12).

Mala king oyster mushroom not as nice. Look like it is soaked in the mala very long and lost its mushroom crunchiness.

Mala beancurd skin tasted ok.

But for a small box like that, to sell at $6plus $7plus, is actually not cheap. Luckily there is grab dineout discount, which makes it not too expensive.

No dine in. Its just a store where you buy and go.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107917244728844048910/reviews
