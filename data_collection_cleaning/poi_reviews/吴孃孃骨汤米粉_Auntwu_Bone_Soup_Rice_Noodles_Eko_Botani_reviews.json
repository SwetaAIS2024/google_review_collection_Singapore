They served some kind of noodles and the lady was telling us that it‚Äôs Sichuan styled noodles. My wife ordered one with salted vegetables and I ordered the mapo tofu. I should have ordered the noodles as well as the broth was really tasty. The noodles was also kinda special. The mapo tofu was quite a disappointment. Don‚Äôt taste authentic. But the noodles were really worth a try. Prices were reasonable.",

Felt like a watered-down soup which wasn‚Äôt very nice. However, they are very generous with the ingredients, the soup came filled with so much ingredients I think there was enough for two person üòÇ\n\nA plus point is also that they provide free flow water and plum juice as well as appetizers (pickled vegetables).\n\nHope they improve on the flavours because everything else was good, good service and clean environment üëç There‚Äôs also free WIFI available which is a plus.",
