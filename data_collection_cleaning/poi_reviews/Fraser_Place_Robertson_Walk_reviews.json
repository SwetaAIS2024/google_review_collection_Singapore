      "text": "We had a good welcome. We were charged for half a day as we arrived early and needed a room for 6 hours before check-in. They gave us the same room that we continued staying in for the rest of the week.\n\nThe housecleaning was well done every day. Only the dishes weren't washed. They didn't inform us that we had to do them ourselves and was informed this only when we asked after a few days.\n\nThe room had a constant buzzing sound which we guessed was from the exhaust fan.\n\nOther than these things, we had a comfortable stay. Happily walked to Chinatown, Arab Street, Little India, Clarke Quay, Jubilee Park, Fort Canning Park, etc. The hotel also has plenty of restaurants and other eateries around it.\n\nOnly we did not feel it was worth the prices charged.",

      "text": "We recently stayed at this apartment hotel to celebrate family birthdays, and unfortunately, our experience was far from what we expected—especially for a property that claims to be 5-star. Here are several important things to note:\n\n1. Check-in Process: We were asked to present physical ICs, but we only had our digital versions via the Singpass app. In Singapore, digital ICs are widely accepted——yet the front desk insisted they were not valid here. Eventually, we were allowed to check in since no one had brought a physical IC, but this outdated policy was frustrating.\n\n2. Room Condition: While the room wasn’t filthy, it was severely worn down. From the old sofa and faded throw pillows to the tired-looking bathrooms and tiny TV, everything felt neglected. We expected better upkeep from a 5-star property.\n\n3. Kitchen Cleanliness: The kitchen was dirty and greasy, with stained and unattractive wall tiles. It certainly didn’t feel hygienic or inviting to use.\n\n4. Utensils: The utensils provided were overly worn and clearly due for replacement. They looked like they'd been in use for far too long.\n\n5. *mBreakfast Experience: The most disappointing part was our experience with the breakfast staff—particularly one older lady who was visibly annoyed with us from the moment we arrived. Despite our polite greetings, clearing our own plates, and speaking kindly, she remained cold and unfriendly. What’s worse, we noticed a stark difference in how she treated non-Asian guests—with warm smiles and welcoming gestures. Sadly, this felt like racial bias. On top of that, the breakfast selection was quite limited.\n\n6. Hotel Exterior and Amenities: The building façade is clearly in need of renovation. The pool’s jacuzzi wasn’t working, adding to the sense of neglect throughout the property.\n\n**Will we return?** Definitely not. Between the disappointing service, outdated facilities, and a deeply uncomfortable experience rooted in perceived racism, this is not a place we would recommend—especially not for special family occasions.",

      "text": "Excellent 6 week stay at Fraser Place Robertson Walk as we relocated to Singapore. Spacious 2 bedroom apartment with plenty of storage for suitcases and other large items. Staff was extremely friendly and efficient. Every time I called to ask a question or request something, it was done promptly and often within minutes. The daily breakfast was plentiful and with enough variety that we didn't get bored. It was a huge help with a young child. Special thank you to the breakfast staff who were always so smiley and welcoming to our young daughter. The pool and gym were just right and the kids playground and water play area were perfect for a toddler. I even enjoyed a few afternoons working with my laptop on the breezy, 3rd floor patio. Location can't be beat with just minutes walk to restaurants, bars, grocery store, and the river. Really a wonderful place to start your journey in Singapore.",

      "text": "This was a comfortable stay. The rooms are not flashy or luxurious, but they are large with good amenities for travelers. The furniture is dated and the place is overdue for a renovation.\n\nThe reception staff was all business and didn't really tell us much about the room, building, or surrounding area. The housekeepers were very friendly and did a good job cleaning. I works say I was most impressed by this aspect as the rooms are quite large (apartment size) and the room despite being old, was very clean.\n\nThe pool is quite small, but the fitness room was surprisingly large with attached locker rooms that have both a sauna and steam room. There was just enough equipment and weights to help work off all of the food you will be eating.\n\nThe views were good and the location is a big plus if you are staying here. Everything was a 10-20 walk. There are a lot of restaurants and bars in the area that made the nights very enjoyable. In the mornings, 4 coffee shops across the street in the nearby commercial shopping center were a great start to our day. There is even a grocery store open until 2200 to stock up the mid-size refrigerator in the room.\n\nThe room had a combo dryer and washer, two bathrooms, and even a filtered water dispenser. The kitchen was outfitted with a Nespresso coffee maker, large microwave, and a gas stove. There were four silverware and plate settings. This was very convenient on days we wanted to remain at our temporary home and relax. *This apartment was larger than our first home.\n\nA few things were annoying but I thought were not deal breakers. The master bedroom air conditioner was over the bed and dripped frequently on my lower body. It was the only vent to do this in the whole place. Our room had a few small ants, but we fought them off with prevention and cleanliness. All opened snacks were placed in Ziplock bags and placed in the refrigerator. The issues weren't really a problem for us, but worth mentioning in the event some rooms may be worse off.\n\nWould I stay here again? The stay was not cheap, but i think the convenient area and the sum of all the amenities make it worthwhile. The value is there as most hotels could accommodate my family if I purchased two rooms. Because of this, the hotel was a fair amount less expensive in comparison. I would definitely choose to stay at this hotel again!",
