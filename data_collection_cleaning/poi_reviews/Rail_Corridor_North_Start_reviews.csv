Rae Gus,5,"Sunday morning walk. A fresh breathe of oxygen. Took a long stroll from the start of Villa Verde to Marsiling Station. A good exercise. Less than 10 km walk. My watch stopped syncing somewhere along the trail.

Route is an uneven mixed of gravel, sandpit & concrete. Surrounded by bushes & greenery. You may want to bring hiking stick for safety reason or as a walking aid.

So far ni sighting but do be careful for morning crawlies greeters for those with faint heart. Good for day walk & not night walk as there are no lamp posts along the trail.

Bring water bottle. There is a toilet & water cooler halfway along the Kranji Industrial Park. If you missed it, you can stopby Kranji Stn at the end of the trail walk before continuing to Marsiling Stn.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100148417347763009882/reviews
Bobojam,5,Late post. Went for a walk couple of weeks ago. Started at Holland towards Bukit Timah. The road was flat and gentle to the legs. It wasn’t crowded on that Sat morn after a brief rain. Luckily the weather wasn’t too humid. We were greeted with lots of greens. Wonderful trail and hope to complete the whole route next round,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112564684295061498928/reviews

Ram Nagarajan,5,"The entire stretch of rail corridor from ten mile to kranji is actually the real green corridor. It has a grassy path paved by the footfall in this track. Near kranji, it is a bit muddy if you go after rain, also beware of snakes, happened to see one equatorial spitting cobra.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117225861336126475144/reviews
