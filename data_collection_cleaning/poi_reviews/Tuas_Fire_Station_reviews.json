      "text": "On Saturday morning, we visited Tuas Fire Station! The experience was fantastic, and we were fortunate to have the station to ourselves (perhaps because Tuas Fire Station is located at the far end of Singapore), which allowed us to enjoy a personalized tour. WO Ridzman and Shaffiq guided us around the station, introducing us to the behind-the-scenes operations, the advanced robotic vehicles, and the various types of firefighting equipment. The kids had the chance to try on the firefighter uniform and helmet, and we even participated in a firefighting demonstration. Hats off to these brave individuals who are always first on the scene. Thank you for your service and for keeping Singapore safe!",

The firemen at the station were very friendly and design stations that were interactive and fun for both adults and kids! We got to see all the cool tech gadgets like the robo 'dog'. The highlight of the day was definitely the cute outfit that made the kids feel so special and parents to snap pictures non-stop.",
