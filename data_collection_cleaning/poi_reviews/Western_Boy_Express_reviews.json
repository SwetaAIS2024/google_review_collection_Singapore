      "text": "Average western food, had the half spring chicken with cream spaghetti.\n\nCream Spaghetti taste ok, portion quite acceptable good.\n\nFried spring chicken too small and dried until the little drumstick and wing also meatless. Maybe will try out others dishes next time.\n\nOver heard my next table also complaining on their fish and chips.. flour too thick.. No comment on this..\n\nService still pretty good for the staff at the moment.. But food need to keep it up.. as their price also not cheap.. for $8.90 per set.. additional $3 for small bowl of salad, fries, and soup.\n\nSitting spacing as usual tight spacing, especially diners trying to squeeze their way through in-between the chairs and tables..\n\nAfter the management does their arrangements replacing the table stand.. it's become very messy to dine in.. with the untidy arrangements of table and chairs around..",
