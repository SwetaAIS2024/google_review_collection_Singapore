Anna Bervander,5,Euro Soccer is such a great environment for the kids to play and learn! My boys Emil and Aksel love playing football and being part of this club! It’s been an amazing first season and I’m so happy we signed up with Euro Soccer! I usually come to practice to observe and I love how all the coaches manage to balance serious practice with fun and being encouraging yet strict. Go Euro Soccer!!!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109588373654471287045/reviews
Magda Adbelwahab,5,Euro Soccer Academy a Fantastic Experience. I recently had the pleasure of enrolling my child in the Euro Soccer Academy and I couldn't be happier with their program. The academy provides top-notch coaching and training for young soccer enthusiasts.The coaches at Euro Soccer Academy are highly skilled and knowledgeable.

Andres Acosta,1,"I strongly DO NOT  recommend this Academy. Try to stay away from it. My kid had been playing soccer for 5 years and EuroSoccer  DESTROYED HIS LOVE  for the game In just 1 year. The coaches know very little about soccer nor have experience ( none are European as the name suggests by the way) , they generally don’t pay attention to the kids during practice and the games are discouraging. Not a good level at all! There are other much better academies in Singapore.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106945701777296145195/reviews
