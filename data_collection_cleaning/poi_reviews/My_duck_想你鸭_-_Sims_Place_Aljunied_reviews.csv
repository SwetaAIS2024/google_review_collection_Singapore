Jamie Chan,5,"ordered the char siew and roasted pork takeaway and its so good!! packaging is thoughtful and creative, we have a choice of 3 sauces - garlic chilli, sambal chilli and i think plum sauce(?). the char siew is caramelised so well and the bbq sauce on top elevates its taste. the roasted pork is balanced with meat and fats, and the skin remains crispy even in takeaway. even the rice is well cooked with sesame oil, i could eat it alone~ not to forget the service at the restaurant, really nice and friendly people! the place is definitely a must visit and food a must try! :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112575964545839059313/reviews

Joey Chan,5,Love the packaging and the experience i get from the meal. The taste of the duck rice is great; duck skin was juicy and tasteful.. Got it at their promotional price but I would totally buy this again once itâ€™s over. Totally recommend!!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101409018203038442367/reviews
Sherin Yap,3,"Ordered char siew noodles to dine in. Presentation was good. Taste is average. Soup was bland n tasteless. Nothing to wow about. If there is no $1 to offset the bill, i would consider an expensive char siew noodles for this portion.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100309903465095999277/reviews
Joseph Tay,1,Took away and the chili got mold. I guess the condiments are prepacked. The mould don't look like it's fresh but left it out for sometime already.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116919087982630933470/reviews
