      "text": "Healthcare worker here. Was told by my hospital that healthcare workers would be prioritized for walk-in booster shots, just need to bring your staff pass. Unfortunately, was turned away by Fullerton Health, saying that they are unable to provide the booster shot without a booking (despite MOH stating on their website this centre is available for walk-ins).\n\nUnfortunate as I tried to take time off my busy schedule to make it for the booster shot, with me taking a cab right after work. Very poor planning and execution, with no updates on the website stating they are not accepting walk-ins. Noted other walk-ins were also denied their shots. Highly disappointed as I was hoping to get the booster to further protect me and my family/colleagues in view of my interactions with COVID patients.",
