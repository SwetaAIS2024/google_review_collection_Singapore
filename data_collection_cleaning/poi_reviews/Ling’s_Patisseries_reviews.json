All were so good. Will definitely come back to this hidden gem. Thanks for the tips on using grab to pay and get 15% discount. :)",

The polo bun with curry chicken was yummy and buttery too. Just before I left I ordered the chrysanthemum goji berry ice cream too. It was yummy and not too sweet.\n\nGo support when you are in the hood.",
