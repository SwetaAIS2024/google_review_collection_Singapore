Emanuel,1,"Don’t bother buying a house here. The management is useless and their security guards are not trained and don’t seem to understand simple English. Whenever I take a taxi/grab, always encounter problem even though I am a resident here. Tell the security guards so many times and yet they don’t seem to understand English. They are also always not at the guard house and have to find other means like calling the office to open the gantry.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111818426429345958526/reviews

Noah Bey Ridzam Mohamed (Ststephensch),5,I been living here for the past 5 years and it has been fun . There was a Children’s Day party a few days ago and there is a Halloween party coming soon and there is plenty of children to play with and it’s a perfect place to see beautiful sunsets and there is a tennis court full field 3 pools playground and the condor is very big great for jogging and walking.And the summit is very close to bus stops and an mrt station for people who needs it urgently. There is also a lot carparks around the condor with electric charging points and rent is quite an affordable price.The summit is also near East Coast and it’s connected to the pavement. It is definitely my recommendation for a good place to live and to have fun with new friends!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116949570142575132875/reviews
Ruchi Jaitly,3,Pros: Apartments are spacious. Condo is well maintained and decent amenities. Good connectivity and location. Cons: some of the blocks are not disability friendly as no ramps at entrances. Slighly old. No walking path. Mostly just a winding road uphill. Somewhat less greenery,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103624524977524140316/reviews
