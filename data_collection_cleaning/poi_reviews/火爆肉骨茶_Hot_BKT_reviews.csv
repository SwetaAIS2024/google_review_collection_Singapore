xin yi,5,"I noticed a newly opened bak kut teh spot here and decided to give it a try. The taste was fantastic! The soup was flavorful without making me reach for water afterward. The dry bak kut teh came with a rich, delicious sauce, and the chicken feet were HUGE‚Äîsuch a generous portion for the price! Highly recommended, 5 stars ‚≠ê!

It tends to sell out by early evening, so come a bit earlier if you want to try it.

The service was excellent‚Äîpatient and very friendly üòÅ",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117484971733315667518/reviews
