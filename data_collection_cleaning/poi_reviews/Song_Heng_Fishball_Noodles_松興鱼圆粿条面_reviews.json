      "text": "I’ve eaten here before but not written about it because the long queue told me it’s a very popular stall. Though there are quite a number of good fishball noodle stalls, this has constantly long queue. It sells a standard price of $4 per bowl which is great for the social economic status in this neighborhood. The fishballs are definitely handmade as the presence of big containers to make them. The fishball is really firm in texture and not too salty too. Noodles were well cooked al dente. For $4 with 5 handmade fishballs this is definitely one of my favorite fishball stalls. Please note it opens only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.",

They only work 4 days a week.\nMee pok cook to perfect, it is firm and close to hard, but there is why I like it like Italian pasta. The sauce mixing is super good with vinegar and chilli. This must be thru years of experience to get this complex taste.\n$4 portions is big with 5 fish ball, you can try $5 for 8 fish ball.\nAnother good about this famous stall is the owner is extremely friendly, the typical teow chew style. Smiling all the way.\nIt is a stall that die die must try",
