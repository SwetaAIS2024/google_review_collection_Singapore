      "text": "It's a really basic little skate park that I wouldn't recommend. Concrete slabs are bonded with a thick layer of elastic goo that really messed up my timing.\nThe mini ramp is nice with mellow transition and forgiving coping, but it is extremely narrow. So it looks like a good place for mini ramp beginners, but it's not imho ideal for learning basic slash grinds etc if you like to carve into it (because of the risk of carving out of it).\n\nThere are 2 vending machines nearby and SHOWERS (go downstairs, south-east, to OCBC Arena main entrance where there are toilets and changing rooms with SHOWERS .",
