      "text": "Breakfast: $3 for vegetarian noodle set.\nWent at 630am weekday. Noodles are bland. Fried goose is not as crispy. Other ingredients are decent. Portion is also decent. Green chilli and chilli is not self service. Need to be requested.\nOverall very average.\n\nDinner: $4 for duck rice and $1.50 for soup.\nDuck mock meat is braised. The chilli is nice. Rice has hint of herbal taste. The soup has generous ingredients such as corn, fungus tofu, carrot etc. soup taste good.\n\nDinner:$4 for hokkien mee. The taste is Abit bland, taste more like \"seafood beehoon\". More bee Hoon than yellow noodle. Ingredients are generous.",
