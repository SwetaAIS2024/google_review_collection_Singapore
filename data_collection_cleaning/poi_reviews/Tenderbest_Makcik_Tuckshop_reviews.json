My burger tasted sumptuous and just right. The truffle fries were just amazing. I can die for it. And my lychee soda drink was a thirst quencher on a hot day. Hope you can visit this place at Hougang. The only improvement is; service could be better.ðŸ˜‹",

      "text": "After hearing a lot of buzz about this place, I finally decided to check it out. The ambiance is quite similar to the previous tenant, with the same layout but some minor upgrades. As for the food, hereâ€™s what I tried:\n\nSquid Ink: It was a bit salty for my taste. I personally prefer the one at Saizeriya, which I find more to my liking.\n\nChicken Chop Noodles: The chicken was flattened and not served piping hot. It seemed like it had been cooked some time ago and it would be better to reheated before serving.\n\nCheese Burger: It was decent, nothing particularly special, but still okay.\n\nFish and Chips: Again, not bad, but not extraordinary either.\n\nThe restaurant doesnâ€™t charge a service fee, so we had to pick up our own dishes.\n\nOverall, the food is decent, but thereâ€™s still a lot of room for improvement if they want to attract more regular customers.",
