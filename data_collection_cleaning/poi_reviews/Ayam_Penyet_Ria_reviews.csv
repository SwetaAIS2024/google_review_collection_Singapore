Lau Guan Zhen (Sean),4,"Ayam Penyet Ria at Jurong Point serves delicious and authentic Indonesian fare. The ayam penyet is crispy, tender, and perfectly seasoned, complemented by their spicy sambal that packs a punch. Portions are generous, and the sides, like tofu and tempeh, are equally tasty. Service is quick, and prices are reasonable. A must-visit for fans of Indonesian cuisine!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111510773764729640794/reviews

riri,2,let’s just get straight to the point here - the begedils’ consistency were too thick and mushy? the taste itself wasn’t good either as it tasted like mashed potatoes instead. chicken were meh. kangkong could’ve been better. the tempeh was good. sambal was good.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110979957978138902485/reviews
Auraxora,1,Actually dropping a review here to give a heads up to those looking to come over at this outlet. It is legit nowhere to be found when i arrived. Walked around the whole of jurong point more than thrice but couldn’t locate the restaurant. Even went other levels for the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the map and google information is not updated. Please do something about this.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112819767712174592041/reviews
