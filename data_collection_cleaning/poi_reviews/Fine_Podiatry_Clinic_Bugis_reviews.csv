Jan Ile Ng,5,"Found this newly opened clinic right outside Bugis MRT, visited Dr Yeo this morning for my ingrown toenail which was hurting so badly. I couldn’t even put my shoe on this morning. I was also very nervous at the start but Dr Yeo was reassuring and gentle. She managed to remove the nail without too much pain at all. What a relief!

Throughout the entire process, she made sure I was comfortable and doing ok. She also taught me how to clean and sanitise my toe.

Prices were transparent and fair, would definitely come back again if I have any foot issues in future !",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101330632483423875152/reviews
Jacquelyn Soh,5,"Scheduled a last minute appointment with Dr Yeo to fix an infected toe nail. The clinic was bright and welcoming, and Dr Yeo was professional and warm throughout the treatment.

Jessica Chow,5,"Dr Li Yan was so patient with my mum and I. My mum came in for fungal toenails, and I came in later for cracked heels. She was really detail oriented, and we had a great chat while she was working on my feet. Totally pain free, and my feet feel and look great now. Bonus: the interior was really clean, warm and welcoming too :)",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103383799859963693383/reviews
