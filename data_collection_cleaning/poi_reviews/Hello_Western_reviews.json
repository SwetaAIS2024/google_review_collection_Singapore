      "text": "As far as curry puffs go, this is my personal favorite. Due to the fairly constant volume, you're relatively assured of a piping hot puff. The pastry is both crispy along the edges and crumbly when you bite into it. The chicken puff is my favorite (haven't tried the sardine) and the filling is substantial and tasty, neither too salty or sweet like other brands. At $1.80, it's not the cheapest but you do get a lot of puff for the price.",

Chicken curry puff $1.60. The skin was fluffy. The curry was flavourful and mild spicy.\n\nService was friendly and efficient. Be prepared to queue for the mee siam.",

Gravy is on the sweet side not tangy enough, a little light on the mee siam taste. The curry puff fillings is nice but the skin is very hard. The you tiao and popiah is very nice. Will try their western food next round",

      "text": "I am really glad that I can see the revival of this store selling curry puffs, fried chicken and Mee Siam back into business after closed it's business for more than 3 years.\n\nI like their curry puffs very much and not like the mechanical look of Old Chang Kee curry puff.\n\nEven they uses machines to prepare the fillings and dough etc, the making process is still requires manpower. Maybe that's the selling point of this curry puffs.\n\nUpdate on 29 July 2022:\nI had order Mee Siam today and they still have the same taste as what they had before they went for break. Glad they can keep up the standard for Mee Siam!",
