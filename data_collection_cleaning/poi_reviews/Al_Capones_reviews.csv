Chiun How Teng,5,"Excellent place for some drinks. Food choices are wide. The pizzas and meat dishes taste great.  Location is also quite convenient at Kallang Wave Mall. Parking was easy, and it's just a few steps away from Climb Central.

We were able to get seats by walking in on a Sunday.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173267101233175211/reviews
Oleg Leonov,5,"Been to this place several times now, surely enough it is pretty much always at 90% occupancy, which in itself is a good characteristic. Choice of draft beer is rather low, Guinness and Heineken, they do have a wider choice of bottled one. food is great, especially platters to share. The service is very fast. if you are in the vicinity and looking for a place to hang out - this is a very good option",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114541839478904784766/reviews
Angie Ho,4,"Friendly and fast service â€” the team knows their stuff and makes you feel welcome. Prices are good and overall great value. The place is a bit worn though, with some tattered seats, but still a solid spot for a chill night out. Recommend tiramisu",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114632119201744496240/reviews
Anthony Gunawan (R'Borne),4,"Platter was of good size, varieties and portion. Loved every single thing on it.
Service quite standard.
Nice atmosphere. However the whole room's walls aren't so absorbent. So once there is loud group of people on a table somewhere, you gotta speak much louder to maintain a conversation on your table.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113982447075945401846/reviews
