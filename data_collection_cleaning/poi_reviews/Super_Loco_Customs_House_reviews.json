      "text": "Had a great dining experience at Super Loco.. Nigel was a great server who paid attention to our orders and also made sure to inform us what foods were spicy so that we can be cautious in ordering the meals for kids (even tho we didn't ask cause we were too busy checking out the menus)...he offered to put all the spicy sauces to the side, and helped me surprise my sis for her birthday! Great service and initiative!\n\nFood-wise also great (except for the ribs)... my family had a great time n great dinner. Thanks to Nigel and team!",

We went during lunch hour on a week day. Perhaps short staff on the service side, however food arrive at decent timing so kitchen seems ok. Ingrediemts are made fresh with decent portion size. Would come again.",

Was able to store the cake 30 mins before our reservation (though they didn’t have freezers available so beware of any cakes requiring freezers) outdoor seating with views but can get a bit hot overtime ~ Jamien met all our needs and gave us free shots over our anniversary!\n\nWill recommend to others",

The service team was kind enough to wish for my birthday with a small celebratory song. Such a great atmosphere too. Everything we tried was amazing. Thank you Sol, and the whole service team",
