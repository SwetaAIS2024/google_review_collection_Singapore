Yuyu We,1,"This school have the worse student care. Never put your child in it they will embarrassed them right in front of other student, force them to do things they already clearly said they did not want too.

Maz H,5,"I want to commend Boon Lay Garden Primary School for engaging Eng Seng Book Store as their partner. The online ordering system is incredibly efficient, and the prompt responses to queries make the process so smooth and hassle-free. Customers are given the flexibility to choose between self-collection or delivery and can pay via various methods, including cash or PayNow—making it all so convenient and accessible.

I am particularly triggered to write this review because of the stark contrast with the uniform supplier for My First Skool. Their unreliable online platform often forces us to make trips to their warehouse to purchase items—a frustrating and time-consuming process.

Boon Lay Garden Primary's choice to work with a reliable vendor like Eng Seng reflects their dedication to making things easier for parents. Thank you for prioritising efficiency and customer convenience!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106549562345900047214/reviews
