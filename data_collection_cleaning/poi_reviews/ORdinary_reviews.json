The chicken sausage that came with it and the breakfast set was great too.\nEnjoyed the prawn laksa pasta that was surprisingly spicy. Taupok and prawns were üëçüëç.\nDaughter had the carbonara which she enjoyed and finished too.",

Both were really good. Not salty. Staff is friendly and respectful, that‚Äôs of utmost importance in every cafe! Food is secondary to the service! Overall it‚Äôs a great place. This cafe might become my regular spot!",

The ambience is perfect for relaxing, working, or even spending a quiet moment with a book and good music. With reasonable prices and a great overall vibe, ORdinary is a spot I‚Äôd definitely recommend for anyone seeking a laid-back yet stylish environment",

Hope you can improve your brewing technique or get better beans. But all the food is delicious and well presented. I am impressed. I ordered a Stolen Recipe salmon chunk soup, it was really really delicious and hearty. Nice bread too. My friend's shakshuka also looked really good. We will definitely return again to try more of the interesting things on the menu.",
