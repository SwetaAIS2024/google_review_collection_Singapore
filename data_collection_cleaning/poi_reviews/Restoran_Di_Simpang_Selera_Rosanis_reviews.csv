Muhammad Muawiz,5,"Nice and very reasonably priced food. Cashier named is Aishah, she can speak Mandarin because she went to a Chinese school. The food is a bit salty as they have figured out a how to make it cheap but delicious at the same, once you try then you will understand why. Roti canai gravy + sambal I would say the best tasting near Aspira homes area. Fried chicken + nasi lemak is not bad also. Easy, convenient and very very reasonable price, keep it up!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109614946268667457214/reviews
