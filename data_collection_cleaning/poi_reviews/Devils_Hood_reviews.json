The chicken was a little burnt, the coleslaw was sour (can tell from the look itself that it is not fresh) and the bun taste weird too. Not sure if the closing down of timbre+ plays a role in causing the low food quality, but if this stall stay on with the next operator, I hope they will look at improving the food quality. Personally, I won't buy from them anymore.",
