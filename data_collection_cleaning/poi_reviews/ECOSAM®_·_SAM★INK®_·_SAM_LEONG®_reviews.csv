Huzaimah Mahmod,5,"Im really amazed at how nice the boss are and how quick he is in tackling the issue with my spoilt pink spray gun which was bought in 2022. Also recently i actually repurchase again 4 of their 5L disinfectant cleaner because i really like it so when my spray gun suddenly become faulty, i try to msg Ecosam to feedback to them why it doesnt spray the water out anymore and the Boss wasted no time to send me a new device and also some spare parts and also a few small bottles of their products which i truly appreciate it so much. I will definitely support ECOSAM because their product is great, service is good, after sales was also well handled! Thank you Mr Sam Leong. May your business prosper. Good health and good wealth to you Sir. You will definitely see me ordering again once stock is low because we use this on daily basis. Use this to wipe everything in the house. Im even bringing the small bottle you gave me to work so i can spray all over.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106993384986402860842/reviews

Melissa Neo,5,"Highly recommended by a good friend, I bought a Ecosam@spray gun and a 5-liter disinfectant cleaner as well as a few spray bottles from Ecosam in May 2022 when my daughter first contracted COVID. The spray gun worked really well and I even recommended it to several of my friends. A year later (recently in May 2023), I contacted Sam when the spray gun did not work after charging. To my pleasant surprise, he kindly arranged to send me a new spray gun and replacement parts for my old spray gun as well as a few other gifts (see picture attached). This is superb after sales service which is totally unexpected! Thank you very much, Sam and team!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115415421916547532642/reviews
