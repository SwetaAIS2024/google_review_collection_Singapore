wen,3,Ordered my usual kids meal in Mc. The place was not very very crowded. But people were talking loudly. I opted for table service and food was served within 10mins. The milo‚Ä¶ was very bad. Worse than I do it myself at home. Is so diluted and could not determine was it because the powder did not dissolve well? Somehow the pancakes is bland too.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105782342636269836215/reviews
Aaron Choo,1,"Waited 55 minutes for a takeaway order before it was prepared and served. They must have made a mistake or had some error in the system. I had to ask twice, and when the second staff member actually checked properly, they claimed the number had already been called. It hadn't. I was right at the pickup counter the entire time. There was no unclaimed food that could have been mine - only one unclaimed bag in the mobile order section with a different order number. There's clearly some issue with the workflow and process at the outlet. Staff were polite, but I'm a little disappointed they didn't acknowledge any issue and stuck to the ""number was called"" line even when giving me my very late meal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103280005443567910718/reviews
Evon Low,5,Part of Level 2  is going through renovation and thus limited sitting area. Tables and chairs are new and so there‚Äôs no QR code on the tables to scan to order. Will be good if there‚Äôs a signage to inform customers to take Table stand before going to up to have a seat.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106417101267436167198/reviews
Lau Yong Hui,1,"There is an extremely rude lady you have to look out for, when making custom request.

She will argue with you and she will unhappily made your food inedible when forced to make the change. Extremely disappointed by such exprience.

Georgina Lo,5,"Visited on 19 Oct at 1 plus for lunch. The Malay lady staff in Tudung never rested a moment. She‚Äôs either busy cleaning the tables, mopping floors & even go extra mile to find seats for customers. Always smiling & even ask if everything is ok. Her service is exceptional!!!üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª Hope her hardwork did not go unnoticed by the management of this clementi mall branch.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111013906496809048140/reviews
