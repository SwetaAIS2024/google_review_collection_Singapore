However, they approach it as a mini buffet and don’t usually provide food warmers. This caused our food to get cold very quickly. Turkey was quite tough and roasted beef was pretty bloody and the beef lasagna was a tad salty. The highlight was the Broccoli Au Gratin - the cheese was creamy and very tasty.",
