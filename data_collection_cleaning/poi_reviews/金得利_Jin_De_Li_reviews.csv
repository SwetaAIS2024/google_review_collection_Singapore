Alicia Ho,4,"Came here at a friend‚Äôs recommendation. You can tell this place is pretty authentic since it‚Äôs run by Chinese Nationals. Hygiene levels are questionable but food is pretty good. As with all Chinese skewers, the seasoning is pretty strong and if you‚Äôre here for dinner, you‚Äôd feel thirsty in the middle of the night. But nonetheless, it felt great eating this and pairing it with beer üçª

My recommendations are the chicken, mushrooms, French beans, pork belly!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106651880558893608822/reviews
Larisa Pupe,1,Paid almost $40 and this is what I get. The quantity is lesser than a kid's meal. Everything is overpriced and quantity is a joke. Can only taste the Chilli powder. Almost everything is overcooked. Fungus salad $8 for about 10 pieces. Wondered how this shop survived until now. It's obviously a hit and run kinda restaurant. If anyone going to order or eat at this restaurant will be eating at your own risk. There is absolutely no standard at all. Utterly disappointed.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107553511747700766013/reviews
Salmon Cai,1,"Just don't bother ordering from with this restaurant.
Bbq meat was hard, and so disappointed that the soup and the bbq wasn't delivered via the grab.
I googled the restaurant call number, but I can't find the contact number.

Anais,2,Ordered mala xiang guo $26 for 2 pax. Maggi is suuuper salty and full of MSG. Hygiene wasnt good - staff grabbed meat with his bare hands for one of the takeaway orders.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112704779609449894761/reviews
