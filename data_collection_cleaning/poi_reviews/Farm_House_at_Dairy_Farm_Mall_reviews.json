The presentation of the Wasabi was beautiful.\nThe coffee shop had very good coffee and tea. The people preparing the drinks were very professional at performing their task.\nThe only complaint here is that service was quite slow and internet connection was not good.",

This place is rather small with 7 outlets only. But I like the Japanese stall with nice chirashi bowl. I also love the kopifella stall. They sell the best tea and coffee to me. Love it.",
