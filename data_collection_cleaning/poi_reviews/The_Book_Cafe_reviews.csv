Saloni Chandra,3,"The service was good, but everything else about the experience was just average.
Ordered the eggs royale with salmon. One of the more forgettable egg bene preparations I've had. The portion somehow seemed small and the sauce packed flavour. The potato rosti was slightly under cooked and over salted.

Nice place to sit and read etc.
But I wouldn't return for the food.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102687235029879926369/reviews
MY,5,"Great option to catch up on work - they have plugs at some tables and not too crowded, even during lunch time. If you go early, they have a breakfast promo before 11am on weekdays, where you can top up $3 for coffee when getting a breakfast item.

The skinny flat white was well balanced, but the pancakes with bacon and eggs fell flat. While the scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked, the pancakes were too dry. Portion size was great though, it was just right for one person, and priced decently too at $19.90 before gst.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111799357696285253106/reviews

khrhms,5,"Prices here are on the steeper end, but food tastes quite good for a working cafe and portions were great. They have plugs in the cafe for you to use. There‚Äôs a lot a few book shelves for you to pick a book while relaxing at the cafe. Stayed here for about 3 hours and managed to get work done. Staff were friendly and kind to help us top up water whenever. Will come again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
D L,5,"This is not any cafe. It's a home. Great ambience, super yummy food, the menu is amazing. Mushroom üçÑ soup is best. And the drinks are so refreshing. The staff are attentive and kind.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104966613744701231932/reviews
