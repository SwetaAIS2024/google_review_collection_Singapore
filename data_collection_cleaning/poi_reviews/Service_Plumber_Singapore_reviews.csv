Joshua Lim,2,"Plumber came in the morning while I was out, to fix my leaking rain shower's joint. It didn't leaked then, so the plumber charged me $20 for transport, and did not fix anything. OK ...

I called for another appointment at 4:30, because the shower started to leak again, so the plumber can see it for himself. However, after making the appointment, and taking time off from work, the plumber called me at 4:30 to say that he cannot fix the leak, because they cannot replace the rain shower.

I am upset, first, because they called me at the last minute to tell me it was beyond their means to fix replace the rain shower. It wasted everyone's time.

Second, the leaking rain shower just needed tightening at the joint, and they insisted on changing the whole rain shower. Which sounded absurd.

I definitely DO NOT recommend SG Plumber Services!",12 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101979901902318549175/reviews
