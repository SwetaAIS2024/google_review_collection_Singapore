The place is decent and tidy but do not expect it to be extremely lavish or provide bougie service. Overall great place to hang out but attentiveness of waitress could be slightly better",

So some of my friends keep complaining that they had no enough foods to eat as they can only take 1 time for their 1st anniversary.. Same for singing only can sing 1 time until their all their own friends sing 1 to 2 rounds already then can let customers sing which is 3 hours later.. Best part is they said will insert the song for U but they will delete customer songs for no reasons a several times & let their friends sing 1st.. Next time just open family ktv better.. No need celebration Cakes also for own family or BFF .",
