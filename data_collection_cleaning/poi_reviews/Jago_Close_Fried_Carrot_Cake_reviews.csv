Lawrence Teo,5,"The char kway teow is only open after 2pm till dinner. It is one of the best in Bedok.  A little moist, a little sweet, a little wok hei, a lot of flavour!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117418690770659942101/reviews
Kuan Mei Lau,1,"Didn't get to try the food because the carrot cake was sold out. But the reason for the rating was because the service was utterly bad. The man who was cooking was manning the stall on his own. But I don't think I caught him at the peak hour. He didn't say anything and kept gesturing and grunting impatiently. When he saw that i couldnt understand, he asked angrily pointing at the picture of the fried kway teow if i want to order it. When I asked for carrot cake, he just snatched the device for collecting the food away from me. Needless to say, I wouldn't want to order anything else from this man even though I was famished. And lucky for me, there are other great fried carrot cake stalls still available to satisfy my craving.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107212204129306839360/reviews
Sean Yong,3,"Was on my list of to try.  Many good reviews so was hopeful of a good breakfast.  Instead was met with an impatient boss. Wanted to walk away but decided to be patient and try anyway.  Old lady serving was very courteous though.    To be fair, dish wasn’t impressive though it was not bad.  I won’t mind impatient hawkers if the food was good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108535124596952191042/reviews

The Gal Travels,3,"Food Delivery - tried both the white and black carrot cake. Both were good and fluffy and worth the order. For the white carrot cake I requested for chilli and the smell from the sambal was overpowering, would prefer no chilli in future. There was an option to include local kopi and it tastes pretty decent.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106761453869636117275/reviews
