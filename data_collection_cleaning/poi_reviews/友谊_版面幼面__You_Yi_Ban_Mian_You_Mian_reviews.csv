Yi Ling,4,"I seriously think this shop is a hidden gem. Should this stall ever be within walking distance from my house, I would make sure I have this for dinner whenever I can. I have a strong fondness for Fujian style of cuisine, especially for its light flavours & heavy on the umani sweetness of their broth.

Dad’s friend recommended this place for lunch, and it was indeed a hidden gem for daily consumption. It is not THE BEST Putian food I have eaten, but it’s sure something that I would like to eat every now and then, knowing its quality and affordable price.

They also serve other noodles dishes, which I have seen a steady flow of their customers. I was surprised they have been there for 4 years! Lady boss was super steady as well

🍲 Putian Braised Noodles 莆田卤面 ($5)
I love how the broth has so many umami flavours. It is light, non-greasy, and carries a mellow flavour of seafood. The fragrance of shellfish like prawn and clams really elevates the depth. Lightly stewed in the doughy noodles, the broth becomes a slightly starchy. The meat slices in this were quite the highlight. It is marinated with rice wine and corn starch to give it a super sillky and tender texture when cooked. Heavily scattered with vegetables, which I love!

The whole bowl was super nourishing and comforting to have on a rainy day. The peanuts on the top as garnish was the cherry on top. Giving a burst of nuttiness in every bite.
I rate: 4/5 🌟

🍲 Putian Fried Bee Hoon 莆田炒米粉 ($5)
This use the exact same ingredients as the abice. The main difference is the use of super thin rice vermicelli. The noodles were so thin that it disintegrated easily with just a bite. The Downside of this is that the noodles had hardly any flavour and were hard to separate.

Nonetheless, it was still a pleasant carb with the ingredients since the tender meat slices really gave every bite flavour. Soup on the side is given, and it’s the same delicious broth as the braised noodles.
I rate: 3.5/5 🌟

🍲 Putian Sliced Meat Soup 莆田炝肉汤 ($4)
Bought this IMMEDIATELY after my dad and I had the braised noodles. We wanted more of the tender meat slices that were marinated in rice wine and corn starch!

Somehow, the meat in this dish was slightly red than the ones we had in the braised noodles and fried bee hoon. And it was even better with its quality. I suspect that red yeast rice was used in this marinade that had a stronger rice wine fragrance.
I rate: 4/5 🌟

Yeo Meng How,5,"It’s one of the best dry ban main I have ever eaten!!
Chilli is amazing as well with amazing noodle texture. They used fried eggs instead of poached eggs which differentiate their ban main from the rest. You have to try it for yourself! Tasting is believing👍",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116050981949330146011/reviews
chocolatto COCO,1,"SUPER DISGUSTING.
Senior PRC ( maybe mom of the prc lady ) was seen sitting down SCRATCHING HER BARE FEET for quite some time.
And when customer wanna order (probably didnt see it or not aware) She got up and went to assist in preparation of the meal.
*SUPER UNHYGENIC.
- Wanna Ask the customer how your ban mian ? Does it smell / taste of feet ?
So disgusting.
The Chinese aunt (perhaps the lady's mother) sat and scratched her bare feet for some time.
When a customer wants to order (perhaps without seeing or knowing about it), she gets up and assists in preparing the meal.
* Too unhygienic.
- I want to ask that customer, how is your board? Does it smell like feet?",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113076984823053652676/reviews
