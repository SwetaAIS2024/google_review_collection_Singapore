Good WiFi.\n\nBudget means small but perfectly functional.\n\nThere is a 7-11 further up the road on the same side as the hotel.\n\nWe had a front facing room with a tiny balcony. Lovely sense of city bustle and a view of the beautiful Hindu temple and lovely sounds of ritual.\n\nThere is also bar noise - but it stops promptly at closing and didn’t bother us\n\nTip: the hotel reception is near the yellow table; can also use this to signpost Grab pickups.",

      "text": "So, long story short, i think a lot of reviews are fake and done through SERM services, i add a screenshot of a review where they didn’t even bother to copy/paste a given review correctly. Also, odor is bad, mold, and overall everything looks horrible. I understand this is a budget friendly option, but I don’t know how it was possible to manage a place to have this condition. Pictures online are misleading, so i add my own from a room that we got.\nPs: check in is at 3, not at 2pm as it is advertised on agoda.",

      "text": "Finding affordable but comfortable accommodation in Singapore can be tricky – hotels are on the pricey side, and I wanted a private bathroom and my own space. I found this hotel and booked it for 4 nights, even though I saw a lot of mixed reviews and honestly didn’t have high expectations based on the photos.\n\nWhen I arrived late at night, there was no one at reception, so I had to wait a bit, but the staff member who checked me in was friendly. She assigned me a room on the fourth floor, and, surprisingly, it exceeded my expectations! The room had two beds and a spacious bathroom, was clean, and while a bit dark and windowless (with only a skylight), the AC worked perfectly, and there were no weird smells.\n\nThe location is fantastic – close to MRT stations, bars, and restaurants, which made it super convenient. Even better, my room was high up, so I didn’t hear any bar noise at night and got a good night’s sleep every night. Overall, it was a nice stay that ended up being much better than I’d expected!",
