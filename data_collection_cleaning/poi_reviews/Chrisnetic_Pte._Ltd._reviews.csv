BlackVue Cloud QuadCam,1,"Once my company bought a $400 hapco spark arrestor from Marcus, who actually sublet to a freelance Tuas shipyard technician to modify  smaller motorbike diameter to fit my van. He says no warranty as no moving parts, so while the arrestor stays while van stationary, on cruising on expressway the noise increased and pop out almost hitting rear vehicles. On calling, Marcus and another old lady flatly denied any refund in a barbarian tone. So I recommend all to boycott this black shop, and go fixed a $50 one at Yew Tee Industrial estate with metal wires tied in case fall out. Naming itself as Chrisnetic is a grave sin of dishonesty, greed, and disregard for life. All Christians lets avoid them. Just salesmen pretending to be engineers who never bother to read supplier catalogue.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116087505110701530189/reviews
