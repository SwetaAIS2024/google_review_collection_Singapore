      "text": "Masya Allah. This masjid is located within the Redhill area. What a huge expanse this masjid is in. In spite of the large area, the interiors are very well-maintained, clean and comfortable. Kudos to the mosque staff who switches on the a/c system during solat Terawih, making it very conducive for the congregants.\n\nIf youâ€™re coming here as a driver (like me), make sure to indicate your GPS to 150096 or 150104. These are MSCPs nearest to the mosque but still around a 5-7 minute walk. It is only however a walking distance from Redhill MRT station.",
