shiling koh,5,"I wanted to give my compliment to Joanne? Kathy? Sorry I didn’t get your name.

Felt really thankful for her service to help me troubleshoot my UOB app. I tried calling the UOB hotline and emailing but no one seems to have the answer. I walked into the outlet just hopping to try my luck. She really went above and beyond what she her job scope. My compliment to her strong grasp of service/business workflow.

And better yet, while serving me, she had the attention spam to help her colleague translate hokkien for the older folks.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103333935182970064357/reviews
Veronica Lee,1,"Totally agree with the bad reviews. This i the first time I stepped into this branch after renovation which was years ago. Only 5 counters working , 2 on Priority and 1 on normal counter. 9 customers were waiting which only 1 counter is working ( Priority  ) , the remaining 2 of them were busy with paper work. Dear UOB , please don't hire so many useless staff waiting to serve loans enquires or sat in their little cost corners who are busy chatting and gossiping rather than helping to clear the crowd .",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107314562807735146087/reviews
