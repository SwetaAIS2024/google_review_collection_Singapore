      "text": "The peanut butter filling impressed me - i could taste normal butter (or margarine) sugar as well as peanutsss. However it's overall pretty oily and wet (from melted butter i presume).\n\nBought taro and signature coconut for my family too, total $4.80. Family said the coconut was nice, but taro was too sweet.\n\nMaybe I'm used to QQ kueh texture of Munchi Pancakes so i found this kueh less chewy!",
