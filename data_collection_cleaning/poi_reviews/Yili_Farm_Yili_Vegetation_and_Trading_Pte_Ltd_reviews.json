The vegetables are really fresh and leafy. Their premium round & sharp spinach are always my first choice in choosing the right ingredient for stirred fry veggie or spinach soup! I have visited their farmer market a few times and purchased the soiled grown lettuce that is only exclusive for the farmer market.",

Loving the Sharp spinach which is really delicious upon making overnight banchan, simply delicious!\n\nAlso since their veges are easily accessible at Fairprice Finest/Xtra, it makes things sooooo much easier for us to get their veges. Support local and for sure, 5/5 stars from me~!",
