Fruits are always rotten/mouldy, storage/fridge seems poorly maintained. Product price labels are missing, food products are not stocked/always empty. Not much of variety too. I’m giving this review in comparison to the other neighbourhood outlets.",

      "text": "Interesting interior because it just weaves in deeper and deeper. Lots of turns and stacked shelves with high and low ceilings. It's a fairly big fairprice and with an NTUC unity inside as well.\n\nOne stop shop for all your grocery needs. I'm even more surprised that they have a sushi fridge there like what?? This ain't FairPrice finest. Probably one of the more interesting fairprices I have seen.",

      "text": "Appreciate the recent upgrade to the unity inside this 24 hour supermarket. Now it has a pharmacist on duty an upgrade from the previous tele pharmacist. Hope to have more medicine stocked up. So that we do not have to travel to jurong point or jem for the nearest pharmacy. Besides; there are so many clinics in the same shopping building with long queues and it will definitely help to self medicate with the advice of a pharmacist. Also; they have good updated flavors such as pistachio cream and chestnut tart for their haagen daz ice cream. Another perk is 24hours operation which is again very helpful for the residents staying nearby.",

All self service kiosk was closed as well. Kind of redundant if the store is supposedly open for 24 hours but is unable to serve customers at specific timings. I understand if the pharmacy or specific parts of the store is unavailable at this timing, but to stop customers in their tracks for 20 minutes is atrocious.",
