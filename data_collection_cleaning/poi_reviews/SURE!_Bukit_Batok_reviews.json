      "text": "A newly opened Western food stall in the Skytech building industrial canteen features a signature chicken chop that's a must-try. The marinade is flavorful, and the meat is tender. We also ordered the breaded fish, which is crispy on the outside and soft inside. There are plenty of side options available, with new ones coming along the way. Good portion and reasonably priced. Whether you're working nearby or staying in the area, be SURE! to head over and give them a try SURE! delicious! Check out the photo for dining with a view!",

Opened by solo friendly young hawker. Right next to the popular dim sum stall.\n\nAlways like to give new hawkers a try especially those who open at industrial park. It's not easy to run a stall in industrial area as there is a limited window of business. This young man was quite daring and we like that courage.\n\nWe had chicken cutlet & chicken chop, add on any 2 sides for $6 each. Also add on curry puff and mushroom soup. Imo, that's quite reasonable.\n\nCooked from scratch (waited about 15 mins). Both meats are thick, cooked very well and tender inside, Cutlet batter is very crispy. beautiful sunny sideup, love the very smooth mashed potato (very different from what I‚Äôve tasted before), mushroom soup is good too (not the canned variety) and well done onion rings (can fight fast food chains)!! ü§§\n\nAfter our meal, owner asked for our opinion on the food and how to improve. Such enthusiasm. Well done!! ü´°\n\nWe will be back to support our local young hawkers!!\n\nüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã",

The owner was friendly even though he was very busy.\nPS. Order early or be prepared for a looooong wait because it's a one man operation.",
