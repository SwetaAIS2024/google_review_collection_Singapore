Florence Lim,5,"Teacher Adeline has been a fantastic piano teacher for our son, Nathaniel! As his third teacher, she has made a remarkable difference in his learning journey. Her firm yet approachable and patient teaching style has truly inspired him. For the first time, weâ€™ve seen Nathaniel so passionate and motivated about piano. He willingly practices on his own and even requests additional homework from herâ€”a testament to her ability to engage and encourage her students. We are incredibly impressed and grateful for her dedication and skill in nurturing Nathanielâ€™s musical growth! Highly recommended!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101568997556040549590/reviews

Sheryl Ho,5,"I cannot recommend Ms. Adeline  enough as a piano teacher for young children. My 4.5 years daughter has been taking lessons with her for the past 1.5 years since she was 3.  Ms. Adeline has a wonderful way of engaging with young children, making the lessons fun and interactive.

She has a nurturing yet firm  approach, which has helped my daughter feel comfortable and confident while learning. My daughter looks forward to her weekly lessons and has developed a true love for playing the piano.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115365821853045853636/reviews
