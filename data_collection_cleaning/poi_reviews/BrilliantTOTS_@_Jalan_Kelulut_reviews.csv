Germaine,5,"What matter most to us in a preschool is not the teaching method  (Montessori, Waldorf etc ) or which phonics system (Jolly or Letterland) is being used but who the teachers are and how they educate & care for the kids.

We are truly grateful to the energetic , dedicated and responsive teachers  at B tots Jalan  Kelulut.  I can see how the kids dote on their teachers , when I attended some of the in-school events. Principal Cheryl is also open to feedback and adopts an open communication.

The smaller class size means that the teachers have more attention to each student. We also enjoy making friends with other fellow parents and know all the kids- it is good that they grow together. It is wonderful to see our child learn good habits from peer influence, and how the older kids look out for the younger ones.

Thank YOU teachers for nurturing our little ones with your hearts.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115624583892393864691/reviews
May Teo,5,"My girl was with BrillantTOTS from Jan2022-Dec2023. She had Global Development Delay and Iâ€™m so grateful that the school accepted her.

The principal, Ms Cheryl and the teachers were exceptional, they took care of my girl and tried their best to help her.

The school does multiple activities which includes the family. It is not too big so the class size is just nice and cosy. Highly recommended for the caring teachers and clean environment!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107791736734147509356/reviews
Angela Lee,5,"Both my children have been with BrilliantTOTS @ Jalan Kelulut since Playgroup. Now my daughter is in K2 (5 years in BT) and my son is in K1 (4 years in BT). Ms Cheryl, the principal, is very responsive and works passionately with parents to give the best care, education and play to the children. The teachers (Teacher Clandra, Jaya and Jason) have also been with the school for all these years. My children grow up with these wonderful teachers. Even midst all the preschool saga about physical punishments, I've never had to worry about this in Brilliant Tots. My children love their school, friends, principal and teachers.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116601974194200137296/reviews

jol goh,5,"My son had been in the school care since N2. He had developed good hygiene habits, reading skills and thinking skills from his 3 years of learning in Brilliant tots. The programs are designed well for kids and the teachers are always encouraging when it comes to learning. The Chinese teacher is very patient and helpful. He has grown to like the language these few years. Overall, the school has taught my son well in his core skills in his most important early years of his learning. Thank you Brilliant Tots!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103172579991616166198/reviews
