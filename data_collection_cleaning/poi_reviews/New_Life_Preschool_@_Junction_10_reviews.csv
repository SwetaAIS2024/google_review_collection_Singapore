yen,5,"My daughter experience at New Life J10 has been fantastic! She can never wait to go back to school, even on weekends! Ms. Hannah, her K2 teacher, is warm, creative, and knows how to inspire each child. 许老师 has been wonderful in building her confidence in Mandarin with her fun lessons. 刘老师 made her K1 year truly special with her kindness and dedication. We’re so grateful for this nurturing, positive environment that has helped her grow and thrive. Highly recommend New Life J10",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117744967519842392464/reviews
Kasey Heah,5,"Both my children attended NewLife ChildCare J10.
Teaching is not like any other jobs, you need to love children and have passion to groom the next generation.
The teachers there really care for the children and I can see that the children like them too.
My daughter is K2 this year, never in her preschool did she not want to go school. She feel at ease in school and walk around just like she is at home.
Special shout out to Miss Hannah, 许老师，陈老师，Teacher Cornelia, my daughter like them so much that she will hug them whenever she goes in and home.
NewLife let's children learn through playing, learning through things that happened around them.
I strongly recommend NewLife ChildCare J10!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111649684876321713905/reviews
CLLP CLLP,4,"A kid I know was with New Life since 18mths and is in p1 this year. Up till this July, when asked where he learned the knowledge (that I thought was new to me) from, the answer, on a few occasions, has been “I learnt it from New Life!”

I always thought New Life to be character-focused and not so academic in their programs. Yet, seeing the stuff the kid learned there and still remembers now, I’m impressed by their efforts in the program syllables as well as the teachers who conduct them with passion.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104204708005845939918/reviews
