The deep-fried sea bass with Thai sauce is a standout‚Äîcrispy on the outside and  tender inside. We prefer the sauce on the side as the sauce is rather spicy. The moo ping is another highlight, succulent and perfectly grilled. This spot is my new go-to for Thai food!",

The service from Mr Tan is very friendly and if like me you're a vegetarian he will help you out with a delicious veggie curry. My fave is the vegetarian Thai green curry, very affordable, with a big and welcome spiciness from the chillies, cooked in a yummy sauce, and it only costs $6.80 for a meal with rice that'll fill you up nicely.",

Beside the extreme care and friendliness of the person taking the orders, I would like to point out how fresh and delicious each dish is. From Seafood pineapple rice to noodles everything is cooked with care. Yesterday I tried an entire fried fish and was surprised by its deliciousness. We surely will come back to try more items on the menu üëçüèª",
