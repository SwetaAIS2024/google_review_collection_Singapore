You might notice the chicken meat is pretty nice but the rice is a tad bland. But it is the Chicken Rice stall with the longest queue in this Hawker Centre and lots of old folks patronise them. Reason is because it is more healthy due to less fat in the Chicken Rice. Will recommend this stall to people with dietary restrictions.",
