Case Woo,4,Mega DIY Sakura Fish Fritter & Sushi special with a drink was what I got. Amazingly tight generously wrapped sushi with all the recommended popular ingredients including unagi. It was a beautiful construct delivered in a pretty box. Love the texture with crunchy bits inside. The Wild Alaskan Pollock Fish fritters are 2 small super crispy breaded fish fillets. All pretty good. Enjoyed my meal. Shiok.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104415171534053217226/reviews
Sharon Cheong,3,This branch keeps getting orders wrong. And it's always the additional topping that you pay extra for. The lady who took my order even marked a huge 6 in that section on the order form & it's still missing. I think the gentleman making the orders needs to pay closer attention to his work.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103505647368535225764/reviews
Julia W,5,"It is more like a gimbap than sushi but we weren’t complaining! The ingredients are fantastic and I love how many are packed into each roll. Really really tasty, a healthy option and great convenience if you’re on the go. Miso is also super tasty. Maybe less relevant, but I love how colourful and unique the packaging is too.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110435385289345586601/reviews
Stella Andreanna,3,"got takeaway but the sushi fell apart by the time i was home — still tasted good though!

i think maki-san also uses ai art for their covers which is disappointing.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106393102114403241569/reviews
Beverly -,1,"I have visited other makisan outlets before and I honestly think this is one of the worst outlets to go to.

I visited this branch on the evening of 2nd Aug, Friday and I was greeted by a unfriendly cashier who took my order. Well, she looked as though she hated her job!

The food was tasteless even though I have chosen flavorful items. I had a salad bowl and it tasted raw and just very meh! I eat salad and poke bowls very often by the way.

The husband had a maki roll and he was so disappointed in it that when we got home, he made cup noodles. He even said that the noodles was more satisfying that maki roll.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117389095087992565915/reviews
