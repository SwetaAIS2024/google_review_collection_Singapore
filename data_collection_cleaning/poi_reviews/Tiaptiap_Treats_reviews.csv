dez Yaw,5,"We did an office lunch buffet recently and Soph really put in alot of efforts to cater to our requests and thinking cap helping me to sort out my set up with decor ideas! The food was very so yummy and fab that I saw my staff kept heading back to get more, I guessed everyone has at least 3 rounds of the food! ❤️❤️ the curry chix, chaipo egg, long beans and the pandan chiffon cake. They are my top fav. Thanks so much Soph! We reall",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104232540639069664318/reviews
Laa Laa,5,"Threw a surprise luncheon for my mum’s 85th! A mind blowing experience for most of my guest! U have no idea what feasting with your eyes means till you dine here!
Loved how as you approach the dining area, the huge balloons were placed as the backdrop, followed by the lovely Peranakan setting with personalised labels so the guests know where to sit.
The vibrant colours of Nasi ulam makes it a must try even if you are not a huge fan of it!
The special birthday noodles looked simple but the taste is beyond expectations.
Next is my favourite dessert tray! 4 different sweets in a tray! Plus the most fantastic giant ondeh ondeh cake that not only brought a huge smile to the birthday girl but it definitely wowed the guests! From how it was presented to the taste scored a perfect 10!
I would definitely recommend anyone who have not tried private dining to make this your 1st!
I just love the details and effort put in everything!
Simply Awesome 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😋😋😋😋😋",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118407264756743523532/reviews
Tracy Tan,5,"I recently ordered the ondeh ondeh cake from Tiap Tiap, and it was absolutely amazing! The cake was so delicious that I couldn't resist ordering it again the very next day. The flavor was perfectly balanced – the rich pandan cake was soft and moist, and the gula melaka filling added just the right amount of sweetness. Every bite was a little burst of joy! My family loved it too, and we all agreed it’s one of the best cakes we've ever had. If you haven’t tried it yet, you’re definitely missing out! Highly recommend!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103439683809556510719/reviews
