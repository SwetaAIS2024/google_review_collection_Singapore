It's not like students are not allowed to go there. Seriously. Also why can't we just have fun at times. We can't even cheer for the people performing when there is a performance? Literally must be dead silent. It's a literal performance. Can i not have fun. The new discipline master also said that there is no excuse to be late for school??? What if theres a traffic jam. It's not my fault if there is a traffic jam and i can't do anything about it. My mother think's this rules are not that great too. As a sec 1, I feel this rules should be fixed and teachers should not scold students for invalid reasons.",
