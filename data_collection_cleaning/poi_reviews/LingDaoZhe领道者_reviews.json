We thought they might have used the ÁâõÊ≤π to cook.. but server says it‚Äôs not. Would not recommend either broth.\n\nGood thing is meat portions are generous.\n\nVery filling meal but not satisfying.",

Other people's hot pot didn't take as long as you did. What's the chef doing? Sleeping or dreaming? Are the waiters and clerks all foreign workers, not Chinese? Oh my God, the customers didn‚Äôt clean up their food after eating. They waited almost an hour after we finished eating before picking it up. There is only one private room in the store, and we also smelled smoke inside. Maybe the store allows customers to smoke insideü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI don‚Äôt know, but! ! ! Please avoid this hotpot restaurant. Really, we waited for 1 hour for the pumpkin pie. We kept asking the counter staff how long we need to wait for our food. There was no response. We will never come here again, and we will not let our friends come over to sufferüôèüèªStore owner, if you see this comment, please contact me. I don‚Äôt mind telling you how miserable your hotpot restaurant is by your workers, or improve your store, thank you",
