Norman Teh,5,"Ordered the Dumpling Noodles and it was were great. Portions were generous and the handmade dumplings were bursting with ingredients.

The chilli was a bit spicy so would recommend ordering it less spicy. Come early to avoid disappointment as it is frequently sold out by 1pm.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117092717731649898825/reviews
Sean Poon,2,"Great services, the noodles had been almost cooked right. Ones get an old sch taste from the wonton only, Sadly, the Char Siew is out. Boiled lean meat with an after grill method. Would have a three stars review if not for the Char Siew.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104302598059978578735/reviews
Wang Huiyuan,4,"Heard so much that this wanton noodle stall food is good. Ther was already long Q when I reached.  Took about 10mins before my turn.  Husband and wife team cooking.
Had kway teow wanton with additional chicken feet. Char siew was so so,  chicken feet was well braised,  not to salty just nice. Sauce for kway teow was just nice.  Worried if it is too salty.  Soup was hot and tasted good with the few scallion added.  Overall,  can still revisit again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108141325047941728078/reviews
Christina Wong Bogardus,5,"Curiosity got me to try this stall as the line is always long. I came at 11am so the queue was manageable. Lo and behold it is delicious! The dumplings are well packed with minced meat, prawns and water chestnut.  This sized up meal is only $6 with good amount of proteins and carbs and vegetables.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113442825784592065663/reviews
HC L,4,"For me, one of the best wanton mee in Toa Payoh. Definitely the best dumplings: fat, juicy, packed with meat & prawns and most importantly water chestnut, making it crunchy. The noodles were airy and light but I prefer their kway teow. I don’t really like their char siew as they were too lean for me. I prefer charred, chunky fat char siew Hong Kong style. But then, the sauce and noodle made up for the it. It’s healthier too…",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
