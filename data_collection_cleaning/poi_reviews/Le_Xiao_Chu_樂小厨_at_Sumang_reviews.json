It's not always available, do enquire for its availability.\n\nIf you order from them, you get to seat at the big round tables specially reserved for their customer.\n\nFor the sambal smelly bean w prawns, there's only two small shrimp inside.  The sambal Petai is nice if you are craving, this come w rice and it's cheaper.\n\nSalted vegetables soup is not nice, tasted weird, too much Chinese wine maybe. Usually salted vegetables soup don't go wrong but at this place, it's not nice. Don't order, try other soup instead.",

Now, if you stay in the Northeast Punggol, fret not - there is a good place for fish steamboat you can try. The soup has good flavor and is refillable, you just need to ask for it if they are too busy. We also loved the stir fried beef noodle which has lot of wok hei. Can't stop once you start.",
