amosyee,1,"The manager ,  Wendy was very rude. From the fitting room i can hear her talking loudly to the point it’s so annoying , and she keeps on persisting to buy more stuff when my plan was just to buy 501 , honestly i just cannot withstand such behaviour as i expected an outlet at such mall to have more class but yet i was treated with such rubbish service. And i could barely understood her english , furthermore , i can smell the stench of cigarettes emitting out from her mouth every time she speaks. To those who wants to buy levi’s , i suggest you explore to another outlet rather than this. 😒😒",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111000026455771011002/reviews
CR Cham,1,"Terrible experience at this store.  I asked three times for a specific type of jeans, but the store assistant kept pushing the boyfriend jeans on me, saying they'd look great. While I appreciated her recommendation, I was clear that I wanted to try the jeans I requested. Instead of helping, she made unsolicited comments about how the jeans I wanted wouldn’t suit me, saying they'd make me look bigger and weren’t flattering. It was completely uncalled for and rude. I’ve worn that style before, and I love how they look, which is why I wanted to buy them again. After I insisted on trying them, she then conveniently claimed they were out of stock.

If you're looking for Levi’s jeans, I strongly suggest going somewhere else where the staff is respectful and attentive to your requests. There's no reason to spend your money in a store that makes you feel uncomfortable and disrespected.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102383923421524510789/reviews

James Lee,5,"Visited at around 940pm on 4th July.
Never been to Levi’s for decades and missed this retro brand from my teens especially the 501.
The Malay lady who attended to me, forgot to ask for her name, was really attentive and friendly. Giving suggestions and even passing me more styles under the fitting door to try out.
I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed retail service already. Too bad I didn’t like the fitting, was really hoping to buy something from her.
Hope she can keep up her warm personality. 👍🏼",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114496737787871738011/reviews
Ivan Tan (FireFox),4,The Jeans that last a life-time. It is no wonder I own only 2 pairs so far. 2nd pair gets 50% off (Dec'22) great promotion. 510 is an awesome and stretchable skinny/slim-fit design that is cheaper than Malaysia and Thailand from my recent cost comparison.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117659783939101213413/reviews
