Pretty much eliminate many customers like myself who is a tourist and have no desire to download the app.\n\nSat outside since no indoor seating available. This coffee concept mostly cater to young people as I watched many customers visited this place.\n\nNot sure will I revisit this place.",

The speed of service here is exceptional – I was impressed with how efficiently they handled my order without compromising quality. The location is incredibly convenient, especially for those in the Novena area, and the outdoor seating is a great touch. It’s perfect for enjoying a cup of coffee while taking in the surroundings.\nI Highly recommended for anyone looking for a quick, yet enjoyable coffee experience in a prime location.",
