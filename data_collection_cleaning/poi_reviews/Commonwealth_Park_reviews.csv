Vienna,3,"Near the residential area, the equipment is very old and the ground is very wet, as if no one has managed it for a long time.  The place is not big, and it's good to come to exercise by the way, but it's really not worth visiting.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103415808392827589559/reviews
Hob,4,"Nice park and exercise area; it connects to another exercise area via an approximately 600m track along the Greenway.  Four runs of this makes 2.4km. ☺ Lots of greenery, flora & fauna (well camouflaged- see it?). oh, also some patterned grilles- what do you think those are? 😋",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111279973416572568370/reviews
