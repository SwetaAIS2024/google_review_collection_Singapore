Marcus Yeo,5,"I had a great experience at TSN and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking professional dermatological care! Dr. Joel impressed me with his deep expertise and calm professionalism. He took the time to explain each step thoroughly and made me feel completely at ease throughout the consultation.

The clinic staff are equally outstanding. Xiaoxin, Divya and Catherine were incredibly efficient and helpful, making the whole process smooth and seamless. A special mention goes to Xiaoxin, whose warm and nurturing demeanor makes it all the more pleasant. She has a gentle way of making clients feel cared for, a rare trait to come across in any industry!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115665311164143019115/reviews

Lloyd Daniel Anthony,5,Was a patient of Dr Koh in the earlier part of the year. Underwent 2 surgeries with him. Felt that he handled the surgeries and took care of me quite well. Do appreciate the advise that he has shared with me. He has also referred me to a specialist whom I have confidence in as well.
