Jasper Aston Lim,5,"Ah Hoi‚Äôs Kitchen reopens (for dinners only, Fridays and Saturdays), and for those who enjoy their fiercely local Zi Char specialties, they‚Äôve got an A La Carte Buffet at $48/pax featuring a whole list of zi char favs and popular signatures, such as their Salted Egg Baby Lobster and the must-try Seafood Claypot Mee Tai Bak that‚Äôs just chockfull of flavour and wok hei.

From their menu, try also their crab creations, which you can currently add-on at a discounted price. One particular standout is their umami-laden Salted Egg Yolk Crab that‚Äôs loaded with crisp, deep-fried yam strips coated in that rich, savoury golden sauce. üòç",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117931186025944877329/reviews
eileen lin,5,"Spacious and quiet environment that reminds me a lot of the traditional Chinese restaurant I used to enjoy when I was a kid. We tried the $48 dollars ala carte buffet ---  every dish was tasty, fresh and well-presented. Excellent, prompt and warm service from the waiters, in particular, the waiters name Ice and Obama. The place is a bit difficult to locate, probably due to closure of various entrances due to Covid. And yes, the serving is not as small as we thought, so one needs to be careful not to order too much, as takeaways is not allowed.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113816794947803126276/reviews
Ewok Ewookiee,4,"After some confusion and misunderstanding about the lobster promotion which unfortunately ended before our visit, Ah Hoi accommodated our wishes and served us with two delicious baby lobsters.
The atmosphere was very calm and relaxing while very humid despite fans and ACs as all the doors were left open. In times of climate change, it might be advisable to either close all doors or switch of the ACs.
Overall, good dinner experience. E&E",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102644308633578171335/reviews
LX,3,"Food was on the salty side and not very flavorful. Staff seemed abit overwhelmed and came with the wrong orders twice but were nice and polite. Good pricing for zichar in a hotel poolside setting in the orchard area (10+ for veggie, 20+ for meats). Do note that the entire restaurant is not air conditioned, but there is ample fan and ventilation.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102248438615677515145/reviews
W Y,5,Wonderful dining experience here due to the pleasant service and short waiting time - could be a result of the dining space being ¬æ taken by diners. The dishes are really worth it; set meal for 2 pax was of relatively big portion. Loved the ginger chicken and their seafood fried rice. Ingredients used were fresh and generous in each and every dish.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101522161375913093051/reviews
