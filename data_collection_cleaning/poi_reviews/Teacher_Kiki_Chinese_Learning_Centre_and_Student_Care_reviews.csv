Doreen Tan,5,"My primary schooler has been going to Teacher Kiki's for about 2+ years. He enjoys the lessons and improved his Chinese, especially composition by quite a bit. Sometimes he surprises me with Chinese expressions that he has learned from Teacher Kiki. If you are looking for a small size class for your child, and a teacher who cares for each student, this place should be one of your considerations. 👍",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114067111922654869763/reviews

S Wismoyo,5,"We made the right choice to put our kid to Teacher Kiki since K1 level. The teachers are very attentive to the progress and keep us updated about how our kid is progessing.
From having a difficulty on Mandarin, our kid was quickly pick it up once she joined this centre. It was such a relieve since both of us coud not teach her Mandarin. Our kid has been doing great in school until now.
We definitely recommend this learning centre to other parents, the centre puts effort towards their students. We can’t thank them enoughy for our kid’s progress in Mandarin.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117057629491239001435/reviews
