(managed to complete everything around 9.10am)\n\nDoctor and all staff really nice. they communicate in good manners.\n\ncons: i prefer them to call our number instead of our name one by one.",

Everything was done speedily, appointment at 10am, out by 10:27am on a Monday morning. Had to do an x-ray and urine test and usual checks. Kudos to the reception who seemed busy but were polite and clear, and Dr Foo who was personable and quick. Minimal waiting, was shuffled between checks quick.\n\nFew people waiting, but it seemed that things moved really quickly for them as well. Fuss-free. Hope this balances out the other bad ratings from the past - things seem to have changed.",

But waited for an hour and still didn‚Äôt get to see the doctor. While I saw others that arrived after me, get to consult the doctor.\n\nGranted that it might be for other purposes, but it‚Äôs ridiculous to be waiting for an hour when you walk into an almost empty clinic.",
