Ashley Liew,5,"Been coming to Tanglin Mall on and off for some time now, and am always impressed with how brightly it appears.

Many eateries and retail options here, as well as different studios for the arts. Basement parking is available here.

Fab Foodie Swede Malin Nordblom,4,"I really like this mall as it’s having a lot of interior and normal clothes. And it’s a great place for buying your groceries, but a bit expensive. Several cafes and restaurants, food court, opticians, book store and much more. A very friendly mall.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107062657007062713328/reviews

Florence Leow,5,"🟨 Tanglin Mall
❇️ 163 Tanglin Rd, Singapore 247933

🟫 It is a relatively small mall = but it has nice cafes, a pharmacy, retail shops, a supermarket & a foodcourt on the basement floor.

🟧 This mall is quite a premium one, and has upscale boutiques and eateries. 🟦 Nearest train station is Orchard Boulevard MRT Station on the TEL aka Thomson East Coast Line.

⬛️ Target market = the expats living at Grange Road area. The locals also visit this mall for the cafes and restaurants. ✅️ It isn't a very crowded mall, and that is why I like it.
