Jun Wei Chan,4,"The mala had pretty good and strong flavours. Price wise is also on the more affordable side as the meat and vegetables are charged the same priced based on weight. However, meat and noodles are overcooked but the taste made up for it,

I found the 小辣 to be spicier than other mala elsewhere.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105654477728379439763/reviews
Alicia,3,"We ordered the chili oil dumplings - $4.50 for 6. Unfortunately we didn't even managed to finish it. The skin was thick and clunky, and the spice was just not flavorful. The presence of chili oil was missing so the entire dish was a bit dry.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111454597467966256107/reviews

khoo ky vinh,1,Chicken fried rice is so oily there's a pot of oil nesting at the base. Yangzhou fried rice is just as oily! What's wrong with this people!?
