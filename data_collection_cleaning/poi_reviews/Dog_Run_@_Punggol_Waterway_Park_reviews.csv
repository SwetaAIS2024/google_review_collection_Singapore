S Elan,5,"Good amount of space, nice and clean with no potholes or overgrown grass. There‚Äôs very little shade and benches to put your things down unless you count the wooden slabs but those are quite low. There‚Äôs also a tap but the water sprays from it as there‚Äôs no hose. Theres a small parking area at the park entrance but its a paid carpark.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103544649935674572451/reviews
Lionel Ng,4,"A simple dog run with a water point. The nearest carpark should be at the HDB estate near Nibong LRT. For dog owners going there on foot, it‚Äôs quite a long walk. Your dog will probably not have energy to play anymore. üòÇ",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116020449307115383712/reviews
Miya Chen,5,"Used to think it‚Äôs a not-so-popular dog run. When we made another visit yesterday, it changed our mind - so many dogs and all are friendly. Dou had tons of fun there! Finally we don‚Äôt need to travel all the way to East Coast for Dou to have a proper ‚Äúsocial networking‚Äù",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112035048266895716246/reviews
