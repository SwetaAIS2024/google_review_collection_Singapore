Starriie Star,5,"Highly recommend! We loved the 7 out of the 8 items we ordered!

Babi Ponteh, Honey Wings, Sotong Hitam, Buah Kuluak Fried Rice, Nonya Curry Chicken, Chilli Brinjal and Beef Rendang were good.

Dried Laksa was ok but could be more flavourful.

Would definitely come again.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115651858741720491378/reviews
SK Ho,5,"We wanted something simple for dinner, but ended up in this restaurant. Ordered assam curry fish head and otak. Both dishes were great. Fish head was fresh. Love the otak which i am going back for more. Chendol was thick and fragrant.  Worth the drive there.
Environment is good for family dinner and group gathering.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106052152130933399046/reviews
Michael Lee,5,"The rich flavors of the nyonya cuisine truly captivated my palate.  Each dish was a delightful experience, expertly blending spices and ingredients.  The service was remarkably swift, with each course arriving promptly.  This popular establishment tends to fill up quickly.  Therefore, securing a reservation in advance is highly recommended for a guaranteed enjoyable dining experience.

must try: beef rendang, beanjour,  curry fish head, black fruit pork,",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114470968673659962003/reviews
Yeo Kai Wen,4,"Excellent food, but the atmosphere killed our dining experience. The acoustics in the room was not taken into consideration during renovation. As a result, the ambient noise was almost unbearable with just 4 tables dining in. The sound of people chattering and dishes clanging was echoing throughout our dining experience and my group could hardly talk to one another. My apple watch registered up to 90db of noise while we were there. I would definitely reconsider coming again if the place is full of patrons.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105028782764100809863/reviews
Josephine Tan,5,"An anchor for authentic Peranakan food in the heart of Joo Chiat. We enjoyed our selection of dishes today at the newly renovated restaurant. It looks brighter… though I do miss their old batik tablecloths!

We’ll definitely be back to try other dishes. Lots of parking is available just opposite the restaurant, making it very convenient.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112348698048907176645/reviews
