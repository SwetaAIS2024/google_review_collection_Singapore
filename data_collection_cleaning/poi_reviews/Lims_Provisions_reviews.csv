Rajesh Rajamanikam,5,"""A Neighborhood Gem Since 2009""

I’ve been a regular customer at Lim Provision since 2009 but never took the time to leave a review until now. Mr. and Mrs. Lim have always been incredibly kind, making every visit a pleasant experience. Their shop consistently offers a wide range of basic necessities and groceries, perfect for everyday needs. In times of urgency, I’ve always found exactly what I needed here. Lim Provision is truly a cornerstone of the community, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for quality service and convenience.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110273949050063722408/reviews
