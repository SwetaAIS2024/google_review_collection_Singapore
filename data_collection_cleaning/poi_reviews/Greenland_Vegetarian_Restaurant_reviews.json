The fried\nyam ring had a milky taste to it. All in all, the dinner didn’t speak joy. I spent $97 for 2 pax. Disappointing meal. But what to do? Haha…",

The staff are friendly in general and willing to be of kind service. Food comes at a reasonable cost given the location and upkeep of the place. Come and try if you are ever in the area, or just craving vegetarian food!",
