Benedict Correya,4,"A vibrant and spacious mall that offers a great mix of shopping, dining, and entertainment under one roof. The layout is well-designed, and it's easy to navigate between its different zones. We loved the variety of stores—from fashion to electronics—and there’s something for every type of shopper.

The mall has plenty of dining options to suit different tastes and budgets. We had a delicious meal here and appreciated the clean and comfortable seating areas. The iconic Fountain of Wealth adds a unique touch to the experience—it's fun to watch and great for photos.

Conveniently connected to Promenade MRT and just a short walk from City Hall, Suntec City is very accessible. Whether you’re here for shopping, grabbing a bite, or just spending the day indoors, this mall is a solid choice.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292377967743781974/reviews
Kylli Kell,5,"A modern conference center with a spacious shopping center with a very wide selection.
The food places on the lower floors offer flavors from around the world.
Near the Suntec City towers is located FOUNTAIN OF WEALTH -
a symbol of wealth and life. Recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest fountain in 1998, the fountain's bronze ring is modeled after the Hindu Mandala (or ""universe"") and symbolizes unity in spirit and unity, representing the quality and harmony of all races and religions.
Fantastic landmark!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107986808867745897815/reviews
