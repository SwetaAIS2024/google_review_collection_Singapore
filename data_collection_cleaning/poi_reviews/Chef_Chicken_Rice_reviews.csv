Julie King,1,"Yesterday, 6th Feb 2025 I went to this Chicken Rice shop to buy dinner for my daughter. I stood there in front of the cashier for 10mins with no one attending to me. A lady on the other cashier didnt even look my way. They shared the same space as L&M Seafood yet they are acting like they dunno each other. No basic courtesy to tell me that the woman at Chef Chicken Rice stall is at the toilet until 10mins later when I asked.

When the woman finally walked out of the toilet, she clearly saw me waiting there yet she ""terkedek-kedek2"" walk to the cashier. When I gave my order, she looked like I just spat at her face which I wished I had at that time! No smile. Very rude. Did someone force her to work there? Or is she the owner?

I packed some soup and since Im the only one standing there, I thought my order will come out quick. HELL NO!!!!!!!!! She was busy doing other things and when I stared at what she was doing, then started to do my order.

All in all, dont bother come here. Chicken rice is very blah! That woman's attitude is just embarrassing.  Rudeness to the max! If you dont want to work, go home! Dont show ur bloody attitude to your customers! This CHicken Rice store must have already made millions that they dont care about customer service!!!!!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100900424459216137149/reviews
Emak Ahn,1,"I've always ordered here. But this is inexcusable even though first time I faced this. The dumplings were rotten. My kids always eat this. Today I happened to eat it first. If my kids ate it first, they could have had stomach upset. Go thru your frozen stock before using it the next day!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105995950264503989720/reviews
