The only meat we ordered was BBQ wings! üòÇ\n\nThe food was delicious and the ambiance was nice. It would have been better if we could get a seat inside, with aircon.\n\nI would like to send shoutout to a super friendly, helpful and smiley waitress call JOY! What an appropriate name, as she was definitely a joy to have!\n\nThe night view from here is fantastic! Nice place to take photos!",

The BBQ chicken pizza was delicious, with a perfect balance of toppings, and the buttermilk fried chicken was really tender and flavourful. The wings, though, were just average.\n\nOur food took a little longer to arrive, but given the festive season, it was totally understandable. Staff were warm and welcoming, and the weather was perfect for dining outdoors. It was an enjoyable dining experience!",

Amazing and refreshing beer.\nThis bar has some good pizza and burgers and overall staffs are very friendly. You can sit here and enjoy the Spectra show and people cycling/skating. We were taken care by May (lovely lovely person and very jolly). We were so impressed by her personality that we visited Dallas Bar & Cafe twice. Will miss you May! ‚ù§Ô∏è",

The standard of the pizzas was quite a surprise and the chilli and Parmesan cheese a great addition. Daily happy hour until 8pm the perfect accompaniment.",
