But with the teacher patiently and love , my girl was adapting the school very soon. And now she looked forward to going to school and knowing what to expect each day.\n\nEvery staff person we met was polite, professional and friendly. Administration was wonderful and accessible.\n\nAnd also I would like to take this opportunity to these teachers that my child transited through~\nTeacher Rina, Zhuang Laoshi, Ms Jen, Cheng Laoshi, Ms Joey, Cikgu Su and Li Laoshi. Thank you being so patient, love, caring towards my daughter.",
