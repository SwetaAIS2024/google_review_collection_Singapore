      "text": "Food is decent although service is slow which made it hard to move this to 4 stars. Operationally they are not the most efficient but the wantons, both the soup and fried ones, are pretty good. This is a chain store but quality seems to vary across the outlets. The one at this coffee shop is not too bad.\n\nUPDATE 12 Feb 2022: They changed the recipe for the worse, the char siew is now not authentic and uses colouring, the wontons are much more starchy with less meat, the noodles are not springy and just dense. They are clearly cutting costs, but all items have increased in price across the board. It is no wonder that the long queues of the past are no longer here. I would not eat this again. Stay away.",

Wanton lack fillings and it’s mostly flour, but the noodle is only 4.00\n\nBut for sure the springy noodle is the killer and made everything worth. Existing review don’t do justice. Auntie is abit rude and emotionless tho.",

      "text": "We normally go off peak around 3pm so no Q.  When I last asked in May 2022, they open everyday.\n\nThe Vietnamese girl does a good job of the preparation. Not dunked in unnecessary sauces - you can choose the black or white version. Both of us like the dry preparation which is a good portion for a normal meal $3.80. Dislike tomato sauce so we always ask her to leave that out.\n\nThe wanton is nice and the noodles are springy, without any strong after taste. Generous with the green chili. Server’s temperament is pleasant enough.\n\nThe char Siew is ok - nothing to rave about. There is the Kim Heng char Siew stall at the other end of the same coffee shop if you need better char Siew. We usually top up our char siew $12 from that other shop.\n\nJust take note that those char siew people there have their grumpy moods. But the Vietnamese at the wanton shop is pleasant enough. No attitude.",
