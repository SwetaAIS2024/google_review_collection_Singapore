      "text": "Decent flakey crust curry puff ($2.20) if you happen to pass by the area.\n\nI wouldn’t have tried them but they had a 50% off promotion today. Granted they are not freshly baked on-the-spot but a little bit of air fryer magic at home definitely made them a lot tastier.\n\nThe puff pastry was quite fragrant, but the portion of curry inside was quite lacking. Overall, a decent snack but wouldn’t really re-purchase.",
