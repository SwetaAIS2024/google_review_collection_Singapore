Beefü•© is medium well, though dry but still tasty, especially with the sea salt sprinkled on it, as recommended by the staff.\n\nOverall, great food at great prices.",

Every dish was flavorful and cooked to perfection, with authentic Thai tastes that we all enjoyed.\n\nThe food was delicious overall, and the best part? The price was very reasonable, especially for the generous portions.",

      "text": "Value for Money hidden gem in Hougang. Thai halal food in Hougang Rivercourt.\n\nThey have budget friendly family platter as well as ala carte servings.\n\nMy personal favourite is the Garlic Lime Steamed Fish. It goes well with any accompaniments that you order.\n\nFor this visit, I tried the new ribeye fried rice. The flavour is more towards a western approach, with the steak being infused with truffle oil.\n\nThe kailan and kangkung is faultless. Well seasoned and not overcooked.\n\nHad the clear tomyum soup as well. It's clean tasting, could do with a little more galsngal and lemongrass.\n\nOverall shiok is experience. Consistently returning here for makan",

      "text": "Thai restaurant located within the HDB blocks. The shop is huge and can accommodate quite a number of people.\n\nThe sambal fried sea bass is great. You can happily enjoy the sambal without afraid that it could be too spicy. It goes well with the fish.\n\nThe spinach with fried bean curd is something quite rare in Thai cuisine and is good to have. However, the fried beancurd appears to be too bland. I would suggest sprinkle some salt on the beancurd before stir frying.\n\nThe Tom Yum soup came in metal pot, which is rather interesting. Tom Yum soup are always a comfortable dish in Thai cuisine.\n\nOverall, the dished are cooked deliciously and it is considered cheap, on top of no GST and service charge. Will try their other dish next time.",
