So, I won't be bother to go anymore.",

      "text": "Absolute scam!!! Avoid eating here above anything else. Ordered fried rice and additional toppings (meat, broccoli, egg) cost me $5.50. Okay, I thought price was decent because ai orderded quite abit. Until I digged into the food and realised the entire chicken chunk was infact just BONES and totally bare of meat. They have literally scrapped off all the meat in the chicken, yet they still dare to serve customers chicken bones and charge more than $5. There must be a reason why they only do takeaways. Itâ€™s because they know customers will immediately demand for a refund. Trust me. This eatery is garbage.",

For the ones looking for a cheap meal at JP, the usual Set A and Set B nasi lemak are available here too(Singaporeans will know what I'm talking about), albeit at $2.50 instead of the usual $2.",
