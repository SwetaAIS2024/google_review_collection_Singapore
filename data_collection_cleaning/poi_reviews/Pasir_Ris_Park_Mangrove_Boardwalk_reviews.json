It is a nice walk and you can view the ancient mangroves from the boardwalk.\n\nüå≥üå≥‚òòÔ∏è There are lots of interesting tropical flora and fauna to be observed too. Here are some throwback photos over the years.\n\nüå≥‚úÖÔ∏èüü®  It is best to come here either early morning or evening time. Because midday would be too hot and humid for a walk.",

It even connects to a Bird Watching Tower as well.\nA section of the boardwalk lead to a viewing Jetty that overlook Sungei Tampines.\nBird Watch Huts and View Decks were strategically located along the Boardwalk.\nOverall, a great experience.\nNot too hot even in the late morning as the mangrove tree canopies provided the shade.",
