Aykan Rajan,5,"It's a really nice place, I entered through the Bangkit Road entrance. A lot of trees and place doesn't have a lot of ppl, so nice to take a stroll or cycle there. There is a cool sand playground and fitness area, equipped with swings, slides, benches and dustbins ðŸ’€. If you walk for a while there's actually a connector into the Chestnut Nature Park in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.
The 4th and 5th images show the connector, which is directly under the BKE. Beware though, I'm not lying it actually feels a bit creepy there and I saw a golden idol on the top of a soil mound on the right and just beside that there was graffiti on the wall saying "" Be careful "". The connector is a bit dark and the path isn't really proper.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116092056400295037057/reviews
Edrie Boomz,5,"Totally lurve this nature park, perfect for beginner hikers too.

If youâ€™re lucky, you can spot wild boars as well.

Itâ€™s a well shaded park with a lot of trees, so you donâ€™t have to worry about the scorching sun if you plan to go in the middle of the day.

Itâ€™s connected to chestnut nature park, but be sure how to get there as I almost walked into the bike trail instead.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111751045487129289869/reviews
Jason LimKH,5,"Zhenghua Nature Park is one of my favourite neighbourhood park. Today spent 1-1.5 hours walk from one end till another end. Along the journey, squirrels, chicken can be seen. Sometime if you are lucky, wild boars also can be spotted, need to be careful. Overall, It's is a good place for family, friends' outdoors activities.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106186053402153829099/reviews
Sing Eu,4,"A fairly linear and shady neighbourhood park, along the PCN, connecting to various nearby parks (e.g. Zhenghua Nature Park, Chestnut Nature Park, Bukit Panjang Park) and various trails for hiking and cycling. Popular with families, joggers and cyclists.

Very lush greenery, providing good shade in the morning. Nice scenic nature view along the trail. A sandy children's playground and a fitness corner along it.

Seems narrower and with some steep slopes at some parts. So do look out for other park users when cycling.

A little noisy with BKE just beside it, but this park acts as a green buffer for the nearby HDB and other residential developments.

Will visit again, and maybe explore the Chestnut Nature park trails it is connected to.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107791645068746527105/reviews
Forest BK,4,"The long narrow Zhenghua Park runs parallel to BKE. Residence are blessed as the park serve as a buffer to the noisy BKE traffic, yet at the same time provide a green space for them to enjoy. The park is shady with noticeably tall trees.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
