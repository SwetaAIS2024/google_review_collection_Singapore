      "text": "The mutton served in big chunks.\n\nSurprisingly, the meat is not as hard as you would think. Very flavorful and tasty, the mutton. Hopefully I will request mutton curry sauce next time.\n\nHowever, the biryani rice is not as fragrant as I expected. Its good not oily and the masala not too \"overpowering\"\n\nIt's still good to pair with the mutton.\n\nThe given sauce is very ordinary, not my favorite.\n\nThe price and portion are okay - $7 SGD for mutton biryani.\n\nOverall, I will patronize it again if I come to Farrer Road, but it's not the best biryani mutton in my book, just slightly above average.\"\n\n2nd visit is a nightmare..\n\nThe briyani rice disappointed..\n\nThe worst chicken I ever had (tasteless) .. the portion disappointed.. they use the biryani to cover the chicken to make it look bulky or a lot..",

The curry sauce is very tasty, and I usually order the plain prata which is nice and a bit crispy but they have lots of choices with the fillings for the prata.  Also serverd briyani rice, either with chicken or mutton.\n\nUsually has a short line for breakfast but otherwise quick service.  Very reasonable price.",

It's simply amazing. Glad I tried it after reading other's review.\nYou definitely have to try this if you are in the neighborhood.",

      "text": "I am surprised by how yummy this is!\n\nCaveat - it is not spicy type, tho super flavourful. You literally do not need the curry gravy, tho u can save it for another day.\n\nI ordered a lamb and chix briyani, and 3 of us had a great meal. Love how the rice is just perfectly cooked and so flavorful. I actually do not need the curry gravy or meat. Pricing is a steal.\n\nService is functional and it is a clean hawker centre. All good, in my books.\n\nI do wish they have papadum. That wld make perfection.\n\nThank you. I will be back.",
