We contacted Thomas through the recommendation of a relative to help source a submariner date Rolex watch as a wedding gift for my son. Thomas was very helpful and professional. He asked us to first register interest first and invited us to the shop to view other watches. Couple of days later he shared good news. Rest is history. We are happy customers üòäüôè",
