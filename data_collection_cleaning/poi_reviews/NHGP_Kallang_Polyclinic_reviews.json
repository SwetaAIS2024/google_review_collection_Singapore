      "text": "I went there twice in 2024. And twice in 2025. I find the service wonderfully good. Everything seemed to work very well, especially the checkin kiosk.\n\nBut the new system requiring patients to check BP and BMI on the self-service machines needs to be reviewed. I went to level 4, and there was no indication anywhere to say it was self-service. So i waited foolishly for a staff to appear behind the counter. No one did. There were also no instructions at all on how to use the machines.\n\nIt should not be assumed that all patients would be familiar with the use of such new technology to check their own BP and BMI. Many polyclinic customers are elderly.\n\nToday, however, I was sent to level 2 and both the BMI and BP machines (see photos) had instructions, unlike the two at level 4 and there were 3 very helpful staff at level 2 to help the old folks test their BMI and BP.\n\nThe level 2 BP machines even had an iPad each attached for patients to scan their NRIC. The iPad was missing on the one at level 4.\n\nIn any case, my self administered test results were extremely wrong. I deliberately tested myself twice just to be sure. I could have used the machine wrongly in the absence of user instructions.\n\nBut i must say that all medical and admin staff were most polite and professional, except for one technician who gave me wrong information.",

      "text": "During my visit to the polyclinic, I encountered an unpleasant experience at the registration counter. The staff member Nazilawati Binte Abu Bakar displayed a lack of professionalism, speaking in a dismissive and impatient tone when I asked for assistance. Instead of offering guidance, she appeared frustrated, making the process more stressful than necessary.\n\nA healthcare setting should prioritize patient care and ensure that all visitors feel respected and supported. I hope that the management will address such service issues and provide better training for front-line staff to improve patient experiences.",

      "text": "I truly believe that the organisation would seek to ensure wait for each patient is not long. We need to understand that long wait could be due to delay caused by earlier patients who were not punctual with their appointment time. Also, each patient has different medical issues which doctors cannot predict on the duration of time needed to attend to the patient. Most of all, this is a public organisation, waiting in queue should be expected.  It is a new polyclinic and if they are slower or ‘blur’ in service, seek to understand as staff maybe new or trying to familiarise with new environment and/or setup.\n\nMy experience had been very pleasant thus far.  Clean and spacious environment with super efficient and helpful staff. Kudos especially to the doctors and nurses who were superb. They helped make each visit a pleasant and assuring one.",

      "text": "TLDR: long waiting times might be caused by various reasons like patients taking a long time but the staff were so understanding and patient, answers all your questions.\n\nHospital is new and clean and tech-equipped for quick processes, from registration to payment. I understand why boomers on GMaps complain—it's their frustration with technology.\n\nAlso, a lot of Singaporeans on Google Maps complaining about the long wait times. But the ones causing the long wait times are patients themselves. I overheard an auntie asking so many questions in the room, another auntie hogging the counter, scrolling her phone to decide her next appointment date.\n\nI beg to differ but I had a great time here. I waited an hour and a half for my consultation but the doctor was so patient to answer my questions and explained to me thoroughly what I needed to do next.\n\nCame back for blood tests and vaccs a few days later. Blood tests took me ten minutes in and out. Before my vacc I went for lunch and received a call from RN Rina Foo Shi Yuan who saw my schedule and asked if I'd like to have my vacc earlier so I don't have to loiter, but I was already eating lunch. I did appreciate her bumping me up to a free slot when it was available.\n\nI went for my vacc and was called at exactly 2pm and RN Rina saw me, again taking the time to answer my questions for me to choose the right vacc.",

Can’t book certain services on their app. Have to call and make an appointment. Don’t have emails or a system to receive reports or memos. I had to ask my private doctor to fax. Who still has a fax machine in this day and age? The staff helping me had to physically run to another room to get the fax! Amazing. Had to make sure I was in 2025 and not 1985.",
