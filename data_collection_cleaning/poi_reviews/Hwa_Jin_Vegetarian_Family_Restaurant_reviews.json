      "text": "BEST Mala dry noodle ever!\n\nThey used to have the best dry noodle (Âπ≤ÊçûÈù¢) IMO, but ever since they changed the base (it used to have more mushroom and gravy), I switched to their Mala dry noodle and has never once looked back! Only downside is, the spicy level changes every time, either too spicy or not spicy at all haha.\n\nTheir set (rice + soup), I love the rice, super tasty. The soup, i think it largely depends on what is the soup of the day‚Ä¶. As I usually feel really thirsty after having meal there.",
