Plenty of space for strollers, and safe areas for children to walk around. We even grabbed some snacks nearby and had a small picnic. Clean, accessible, and perfect for a quick family outing with amazing photo op",

Also gives a picturesque view. Evening view is also very nice . Try walking around the place in the evening , which is simply surreal experience",

The statue itself is smaller than expected, but the view of Marina Bay Sands and the city skyline makes it worth the visit. Itâ€™s a great photo opportunity, especially at sunrise or sunset. Can get crowded during peak hours, so early morning is best. Nice place for a short stop while exploring the city!",

The iconic Merlion statue, with the Marina Bay skyline in the background, makes for stunning photo opportunities. The area is clean, spacious, and well-maintained, offering a relaxing atmosphere to walk aroundâ€”especially in the early morning or evening. There are benches and shaded spots to rest, and itâ€™s close to other key attractions like Marina Bay Sands and the Esplanade. While it can get crowded with tourists, itâ€™s still a memorable and symbolic part of any visit to Singapore.",
