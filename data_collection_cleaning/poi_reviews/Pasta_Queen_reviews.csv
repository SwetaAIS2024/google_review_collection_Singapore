Low Bao Heng,4,"Went trying this new western food in Punggol. Takeaway the Mixed Grill ($15.90) and the Budget Meal - Chicken Mushroom Spaghetti ($2.80).

The mixed grill is really good. Even the budget meal at that price, the portion is big. generous.

Kai Jie,1,"Ordered their signature chicken chop as they call it, it costs $9.50. Look at my picture, small piece of normal tasting chicken, taste of coleslaw isnâ€™t fantastic, very small portion of baked beans, and typical fries. Serving portion for $9.50 is very disappointing and the overall taste was not even impressive. Sorry but for the price, taste, and quantity, this place is not recommended.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116040620256115569605/reviews
