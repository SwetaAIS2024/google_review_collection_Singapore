kunjeeboi Gomez,5,"First time here. I heard good things about this place from a colleague so we decided to have a farewell dinner here.  We enjoyed the great ambience as we were seated outside. The music was not too loud, we were probably louder. ðŸ˜… Food was fantastic! I highly recommend the chicken masala pizza. The lamb pizza wasn't as good as the chicken Pizza. The Kilkenny pint was nice as well. Dessert brownie was rich and sweet. I hope to visit again in the future. Keep up the great work.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116940179546306653309/reviews

Mohan Chandrasekaran,4,"We had a wonderful dining experience.

What truly made our visit special was the exceptional hospitality. One of the servers Mr, Nayab went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. He was incredibly kind and patient, especially with our childrenâ€™s little bursts of energy and mischief. His calm, friendly demeanor and warm service really stood out and made us feel right at home.

Thank you for such a lovely experience â€” weâ€™ll definitely be coming back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106411941727676926882/reviews
