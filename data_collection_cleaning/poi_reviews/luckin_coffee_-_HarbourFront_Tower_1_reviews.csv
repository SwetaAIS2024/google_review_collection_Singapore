Asia Apparel,4,"The no-frill coffee that settles my caffeine needs. Ordered from my app and collected in few minutes at counter. Fast, cheaper and near zero contact automation.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112168507594751691491/reviews
Mark Ong,4,Cheap coffee but out of the way. Little hard to find. One of those store that cater for the surrounding office crowds than to bonafide individual. Quite a distance from the subway station or the malls. The rewards? Half the average price of typical chains. Faster process time as it's not that popular compared to it's other branches.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117348003086836979353/reviews

Ritz Bitz,4,"Staff at Luckin are generally impersonable at any branch, likely because of their business model. However, this particular girl is the worst. My two attempts at checking in with her were met by a stony stare and absolute silence. She really didnt respond! Unbelievable. The drink is average but i do appreciate the 60% voucher and fast production time of the drink. So still give 4 stars!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110358387947738376597/reviews
