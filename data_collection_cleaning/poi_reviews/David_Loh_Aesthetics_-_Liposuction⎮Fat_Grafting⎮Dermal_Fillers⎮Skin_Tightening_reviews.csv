AR AR (ANImosity),1,"Went for a lipo consultation early last year at the Novena Med Ctr. I didn't find doctor David Loh approachable. He honestly had a low demeanor, unfriendly, wasn't approachable. And I found him lazy tbh. I am of normal bmi, but carry abit more fat in my arms and upper thighs. Which is why I was clearly there. Before assessing my body. He upright called me fat, stating, just by looking at my arms (because I was in a sleeveless dress) and asked his nurse to offer me Saxenda injectables( close to $500), without knowing my medical history/allergies. Told me to use them and come back after 3 months. It seems like he just wanted to make immediate money out of the ""free"" consultation. I tried using the appetite suppressant injectables but experienced bloating and indigestion and discontinued. All of which was also not properly explained to me. The nurse only taught me how to use the dosage. All in all, the doctor couldn't be bothered to sit and discuss my concerns with me. Its like he just wanted to faster  get rid of the consultation. He only talked to me to a good whole 10mins, (with body assessment) and lazily told me to use Saxenda. I went for an assessment at another clinic recommended by a friend and learnt more about the treatments and what worked for me. All in all, don't fall for the free consultation and head here.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106962242422156577566/reviews

Sharon Yuen,5,"I have been going to David Loh for more than 5 years now. Dr Loh is a patient and careful doctor who explains to me in detail before I do any procedure. He is priced relatively more affordable than other aesthetics doctors in the field. I highly recommend going to him.
In addition , the nurses at the clinic are friendly and helpful , in particular Sammie Chiam. She is kind and caring and makes the experience truly comfortable and reassuring",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107123216369595484065/reviews
Yew Wah Lim,4,"Been going to this clinic since they were located at Orchard area and now I visit them almost every 1.5 months at Novena. While I may not have had many sessions with Dr Loh, the few encounters I had with him had been very pleasant where he had listened attentively and provided his advice professionally. I usually have my treatments done by Sammi. She is polite, very service oriented and has a very warm personality which put me very at ease whenever and whatever treatments she is doing for me. She doesn't hard sell and will even discourage me when she thinks I do not need certain treatments. This is a clinic (and of course Sammi) that I'll recommend if anyone would like to better improve their looks.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112133670564802597299/reviews

I’m very grateful to have Sammie to help me, for my face’ issues (pigmentation, pores etc). She is not a pushy type but would provide appropriate suggestions to address the issues.
