Calbee Cracker,5,"Have been going to Bee Choo for 3 years on a monthly basis. Happy to have healthy shiny hair  now. I always go for colour treatment so all my white hair will be reddish. This outlet is brand new as they relocated. It’s facing the multi-storey carpark linked by a bridge. It’s nicely designed and the new shampoo chairs are more comfortable now.

I have always enjoyed the excellent customer service of the Bukit Merah team since I started 3 years ago. They are patient, friendly and professional.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110229110724135670872/reviews
Jennis Neo,5,"Have been visiting this Bukit Merah branch for 2 years now. I like the fuss free treatments and the staff there are always nice and friendly ! Nobody tries to sell me any package or products- so it’s a blissful experience every time. Now they moved to a new location nearer central, I also followed them here.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112692814981715708209/reviews
Ivanna W,5,"I have been going to Bee Choo for years now. I think they are affordable and provide good service. Since coming here monthly, my hair is less oily and more healthy. They have 2 options of herbal hair treatment: normal/colour. If you choose the colour option, it helps to cover your Gray hair too. The Gray hair will turn golden red orange and not so obvious. Good option if you don't have that many Gray hair. By the way they are now at a new location which is nearer to Bukit Merah Central, which is very accessible!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117422612191677321157/reviews

Brenda C,5,Recommended by a friend as I used a shampoo that was too strong from other salon causing some scalp issues. Was able to book a same day last minute slot luckily. The staff at Bukit Merah were friendly and gentle during the whole process. They were patient with my questions and even recommended a suitable shampoo for my current scalp condition. Thank you :)),2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105318186427289338926/reviews
