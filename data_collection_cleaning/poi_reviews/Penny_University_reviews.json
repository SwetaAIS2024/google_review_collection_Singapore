Chairs are a bit uncomfortable ðŸ˜…",

The food portions were generous, and I especially loved their scrambled eggs. They also provide complimentary ice water, and the coffee was great. Outdoor seating at most cafe tends to be quite warm, even with fans, but this one had two large power fans, making it much more comfortable. We truly felt pamperedâ€”thank you for a wonderful experience!",

Had the brilliant Penny's Benedict with the beet flavoured hollandaise. Watch out if you're going on a hot day though and get a table deep inside. Took one closer to the entry and was sweating profusely which made me cut my time short at this cafe. Will revisit though!",
