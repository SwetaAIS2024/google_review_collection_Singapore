johnnykuochung,4,"After a long morning, I decided it was time for a festive treat. The cozy and bustling Hougang 1 led me to PastaMania, where their holiday special the ""Happy Ho Ho Holiday Frosty Feast"" caught my eye. At $19.90, it promised a hearty meal, and I quickly chose the set with Chicken Pasta, Rock Honey Salsa Chicken Wings (two pieces), and a refreshing Sparkling Cranberry Soda.
I took a seat and waited, noticing that the staff on duty included an older auntie. She moved with quiet efficiency, her careful manner suggesting she was still relatively new. Despite this, she handled everything smoothly‚Äîno hesitations, no mistakes, just a calm and steady approach that added a comforting touch to the atmosphere.
When she brought my tray to the table, she placed it down with care and gave me a polite smile. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your meal. Enjoy!‚Äù she said warmly.
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I replied, appreciating her attentiveness.
The meal looked as good as it sounded. The Chicken Pasta was steaming, with tender slices of chicken sitting atop pasta coated in a rich, creamy sauce. The Rock Honey Salsa Chicken Wings were golden and glistening with a sweet and tangy glaze, and the Sparkling Cranberry Soda added a bright and festive touch to the set.
The first bite of the pasta was delightful‚Äîthe sauce was flavorful, and the chicken was perfectly cooked, tender and well-seasoned. The wings were equally impressive, crispy on the outside and juicy inside, with the honey salsa glaze adding just the right balance of sweetness and spice.
The cranberry soda was refreshing, but as I sipped on it, I couldn‚Äôt help but think about how a spoon would have been handy for scooping out the berries and ice at the bottom of the can. A small detail, but it would‚Äôve made the experience even more satisfying.
Throughout my meal, the auntie moved around the restaurant with quiet confidence, checking in with diners and clearing tables efficiently. While she didn‚Äôt seem like a seasoned veteran, she handled her role with care and precision, never missing a step.
As I left PastaMania, I felt a sense of satisfaction‚Äînot just from the tasty food, but from the thoughtful service and the festive cheer that filled the air. The auntie might have been new, but her professionalism and kind demeanor made my dining experience a truly pleasant one.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110803765536711118720/reviews
Walter Soh,2,"I‚Äôd honestly give a higher review if not for the slow service, and the lack of priorities.

Here‚Äôs the thing, it wasn‚Äôt even a full house evening at 7:30pm. There were probably 6 empty tables and around 4 servers. At the time of writing 6 tables waiting for food for the past 15 mins with only drinks served.

It‚Äôs supposed to be fast casual dining. By now I‚Äôve waited for 25 mins for my food to be served. Do you know why???

Because of food delivery orders. If you‚Äôre not gonna make it in time for your in restaurant customers anyways, why even bother with food delivery right?

Your service is ok. But I‚Äôve gotta wait close to 30 mins for my meal‚Ä¶can you imagine the mother with her child at the table opposite me? The child famished.

You get the gist?

TLDR Pastamania, do better at the restaurant service, quality and time wise, and you‚Äôd do better overall, rather than focusing on food deliveries.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113039568502628385221/reviews

Sarah Foo,4,"Really liked the tomato-based pasta, and cheesy crumble was really nostalgic too! Service was patient, especially Rina who was really cheerful and asked us how the food was after our meal! Atmosphere a little bit loud though.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102454889093117976526/reviews
