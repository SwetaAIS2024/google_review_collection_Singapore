      "text": "Nice egg, the yolk immediately breaks upon cracking so i dont need to durther break it down. The bread size is just noce so i can go and eat other things later. $6.70 for a traditional set. Received excellently bad attitude when I inform the staff worrying that the egg might not be fresh enough for soft boil.\nCame to hospital for visit, dont wish to end up in the hospital myself. So, had to be more wary of the egg condition.\nI might be wrong about the egg but thats what I was taught and whoever say can eat please go ahead.",

This is something which I rarely observe but good job to the team here.\n\nFood wise, really just average at best (flavor and portion) for the price we're paying for.",

Your other competitors are making bigger toast bread than yours! Not to mention about your $3.80 for a cup of large size take away coffee..\n\nEverything overpriced now with toastbox.. No more my number 1 favourite coffee place..",

Upon ordering the Laksa, I was struck by the richness of the broth and the ample serving of dou pok, both of which left a strong impression. Additionally, I found the iced coffee to be quite enjoyable. Without a doubt, it's a dish I'll be sure to savor again when I return.",

The sponge cakes taste great and able to bite into cakes instead of just air. The coffee is very tasty! Coffee still good after left for 15 minutes. My friend who order the mee siam have to guess if the packed food is hers because the staff just continues to prepare the next order after putting the food on collection counter. Thankfully the foods are easy to recognize.",
