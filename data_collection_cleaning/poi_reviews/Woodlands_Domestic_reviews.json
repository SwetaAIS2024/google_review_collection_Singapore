They assigned me the worst installer in my life i ever encounter.\n\nCharge me $60 for installation and installer charge me $80 for wiring and trunking.\n\nThis is the trunking standard of $80.\n\nEnd up i tear down everything and redo again.\n\nFan cost me $198 but installation end up cost more than the fan. Really what a joke !",

      "text": "Shop is located in the West Coast HDB heartland, next to a hawker center and near a shopping mall.  Both owners are nice people and attentive to their customers. I was looking for ceiling fans and the owner explained and demonstrated several types of fan available in the shop in terms of wind coverage & strength, the light temperature, the wind noise, room type, the remote control and pros/cons.  I have learned something new while chatting with the owner.  Thanks for the sharing of knowledge.",
