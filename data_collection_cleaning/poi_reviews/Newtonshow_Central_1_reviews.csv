Vera Ivantsova,5,"Thank you for party on 7 December 2024 for Alexandra (3yo)

We hired Newton Show to organize a dinosaur-themed party for our daughter’s third birthday in December 2024.

We decided to put ourselves in the professional hands of their Manager, Julia, and ordered a full package N3.  As well as the science demonstration, this included food/treats for the kids, a dinosaur-themed cake, room and birthday table decoration, posters, souvenirs for children, etc.  On the day, everything was ready and prepared as agreed, and we just turned up an hour before the start to add our own personal touches.

We encouraged parents to drop off their children for the 90 minutes of the party, although some chose to stay, and that was fine too.  In spite of the children being so young (2.5-3.5) they were enchanted by the Newton Show experiments (dry ice, making plastic snow, burning foam, etc.) conducted in entertaining fashion by Mr. Dinosaur.  Like magic, but everything was real.  And safe!  He was able to grab the young audience, keep them interested for a whole hour, and even get them to participate where appropriate.  The proceedings were rounded off with a “volcano” birthday cake.

The parents who stayed were thrilled to see the enthusiasm and twinkles in the children's eyes as they were watching Mr. Dinosaur’s experiments and jumping up and down while participating in all activities.  We even hope that a few tiny seeds may have been sown for the development of scientists of the future!
We had 24 kids at our daughter's party and received a lot of positive feedback from other parents.  The kids enjoyed the party while the parents had a peaceful 1.5 hrs for themselves on a weekend day.  Many thanks to Julia and her team.
We wish Newton Show lots of success with Christmas activities and generally developing scientific skills in the younger generations.
Best wishes,
Vera & Bernard Samules",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114313594025443086880/reviews

The teachers are not just knowledgeable; their passion for science shines through in every lesson. They foster an engaging and supportive environment, ensuring that every camper feels valued and inspired to learn. Their genuine care for the students' growth and understanding makes a world of difference, creating a nurturing atmosphere where young minds can thrive.
