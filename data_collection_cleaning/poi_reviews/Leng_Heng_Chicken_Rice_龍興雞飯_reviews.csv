Sg Food Review,5,"Wa just look at this gorgeous. I added extra serving of chicken. Good taste, good price, and chilli goes well with rice !!  Will buy again!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108257463057765976698/reviews
Kok Tong Tan,5,"Leng Heng Chicken Rice is the best chicken rice in the area! Have been to this stall since the pandemic times to takeaway and has been a fan since then. Things that really caught my attention is how beautiful the rice is being cooked. Each grain of rice is clearly separated, firm and fragrant. Portion is generous! The other thing that I like to share with you is the dumplings! This stall is one of the rare ones that has an entire prawn and generous portion of minced pork in the dumpling. Look at the picture and you can clearly see it. Taste is wonderful. If you are around, maybe for once, skip the other stalls and give Leng Heng Chicken Rice a try! I am certain you will be back for more!!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108592853232022020585/reviews
Hoong Wai Wong,5,"Super long queue as this stall is very popular and many people buy multiple sets or takeaway.
After buying the chickens rice, I can understand why.
Good, will eat again if the queue is not so bad.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106237336061537561898/reviews
Jon Veel,1,"Initial impressions were good. Chilli had excellent flavour and the rice was tasty. But Oh my goodness, the chicken was sliced so thinly that it was almost the same thickness as the skin. Eat elsewhere first as a $4 serving here definitely will leave you feeling ripped off rather than full...",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111452572739474241710/reviews
1O73,5,"11am-7pm operational daily, closed on Wed & Thurs. One of the BEST stalls at Lagoon. SUPERB FOOD. Cannot rave enough about how good and clean they are. Quality and quanity is 10/10 and soooo generous, so flavourful, yet healthy with less oil and no MSG. It's always a wholesome and hearty meal with Leng Heng. The chilli is power lah, if you eat chilli you know this one got serious standard! My family and friends totally love this stall and patronise it without fail. The wonderful Mr & Mrs Yeoh do take take-away pre-orders (if you are a regular üòÜ) during offpeak hours and if you give them lead time to prepare, so can save you carpark cost and time. They do PayNow too! And they are on Deliveroo/Food Panda/Grab as well.
Their food are all highly recommended but mussst-tries are: homemade prawn dumplings (sui kao), wanton mee, macaroni soup, chicken rice, roast pork noodles, chicken ipoh horfun and chicken cutlet noodles. They give generous helpings of cai sim vege too. They have fried wantons too which are great add-on appetisers.
This stall stood the test of time, of Covid and of personal health closures too. It saved us during Covid when getting food was such a challenging time. They are just so underrated! Show your support to them too - this hardworking couple have an amazing stall going. üôè",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101851419567543058501/reviews
