      "text": "Visited this place on a weekday during lunch. Was the only patrons at noon, so for a table for two, we were waited on by three staff members. Despite the high staff to customer ratios, refilling of water requires a degree of effort, which marred the dining experience. Food wise was decent, the trio of pork being a good value, but probably would not be sufficient for two big eaters. The serving of the course were well timed, and clearing of the dishes prompt. Overall, quite comfortable a place to dine, but could be perfect if staff could be more proactive in topping up of the water.",

Delivers mainly angmoh food with a tapas menu, and for October they have an Oktoberfest promotion. During covid times there are a number of takeaway promotions. This is the flagship angmoh restaurant inside of RTC, not as posh as Churchill room at tanglin but also easier on the wallet",
