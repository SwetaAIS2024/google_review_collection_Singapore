Over just a short span of 2hrs we planted 18 trees, under the guidance of the team. There are also many community gardens in the area, making the place vibrant and filled with greenery. I would love to come back to visit the cafe and explore the place. Beautiful place to get away from the city!",

      "text": "Atrocious service by a bunch of rude, unprofessional staff during lunch. Openly scowling at customers over a small request to adapt a Mediterranean salad for a vegetarian guest when the menu displayed a clearly vegetarian salad was just the begining of the nightmare. Rest of the staff became brusque and rude during service, and was discourteous up to the point of payment. I'm not even expecting service at this point but the sheer disrespect and rudeness from such staff is just ruining what looks like a nice cafe to chill out\n\nNo wonder the place was totally empty during lunch. Good riddance.",
