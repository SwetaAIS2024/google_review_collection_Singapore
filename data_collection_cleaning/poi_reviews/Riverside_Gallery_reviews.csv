William Lu,5,"Plenty of seats theater-like staggered to view the river. I came in the morning, luckily it wasn't that hot and a drizzle for a while only. It was windy morning. Beautiful scenery and relaxing place.

There are plenty of animal here, monitor lizard, turtles swimming also few of them staying on top of the rock, goose, fishes, and many others.

Good place to do sport, saw group of people did the dancing around here as well.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
Meng Foo Choo,5,"Good to seat here and watch the river and the people on the other side of the bank. One huge panoramic view expand the heart and soul of the individual or together with the close friends or love one. It will quench one's desire and quieten the easily excitable heart so that the serenity of life will return. A place to keep still and introspect, look inward instead of outward. Here one find himself/herself. No longer lost nor wondering, remain rooted. Still and release all the self induced reality. See that there is nothing that can make one not happy. Happiness is always here, inside, inward, dwelling within.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118082395255459356366/reviews
