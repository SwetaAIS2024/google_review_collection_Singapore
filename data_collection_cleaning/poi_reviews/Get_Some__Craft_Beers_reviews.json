      "text": "Great selection of craft beers.\n\nI came on a Friday evening with a friend. We had a plate of fries and a shepherd's pie, along with 2 ciders and 2 pints of beers.\n\nFirstly, I wish there were half pint options available. The menu only has full pints shown.\n\nSecondly, we ordered fries to share and then decided to get the shepherd's pie later on. As you can see, the shepherd's pie also came with fries. In the menu it is indicated that she shepherd's pie comes with mash potato (it does). I wish the staff had informed us that there is another portion of fries coming or that they might've given us the option to swap out the fries that came with the shepherd's pie. I would've been very impressed if this was the level of service.\n\nWe found that for $19.90 the portion of shepherd's pie is extremely small. Not because we were sharing, it was just a very tiny serving. Taste was great, just don't feel that it is worth the $19.90++ price.\n\nI'd come back for the beers. Service is decent. Not so sure if food is worth it.",

      "text": "Was drawn here by the good reviews. As expected, good reviews were more for the drinks and beers üç∫.\nService was ok, friendly and quite fast, even though there was only one server.\nPrawn paste chicken cutlet was quite good. Really ‚Äúsmelly‚Äù if you know what I mean for prawn paste. Well seasoned. Noodles texture is good.\nChicken roulade was quite good too. Chicken was also well seasoned. Mashed potatoes has some lumps, which I didn‚Äôt like.\nCoffee is horrible. Do not order. Looking at the picture, both are cafe latte but look different but taste equally bad.\nOverall, food is good.",

      "text": "Great craft beer place in the West. Wide selection of tasty beers - from IPA, lager, stout, and fruit beers, both canned and on tap. Tried several select beers - the hazy IPA (forgot the name) was crisp, refreshing, \"hoppy\", with good deal of citrus notes. \"Cheat Day\" stout was bold and strong (8.5% ABV) yet uniquely sweet, malty, and buttery (with some spice notes like cinnamon). It's like drinking a very tasty liquid cookies lol.\n\nThe meals are also served fresh, albeit rather overpriced given the location. The pasta was cooked al dente with sufficient (but not overwhelming) garnishes and chicken chop was freshly made and come with large portion for a dinner and nice mushroom sauce.\n\nThe semi-outdoor patio is also much appreciated - not that big but still nice and airy enough to enjoy the pint with peace.\n\nIf there's any room for improvement (aside from the price) - perhaps the management should consider serving more sizes of beer, including smaller pint aside from the tall pint currently used. A beer taster set (like picking 4-5 different beers in small glasses) could also be considered for those who can't decide which beer to be ordered or are beer enthusiasts.",
