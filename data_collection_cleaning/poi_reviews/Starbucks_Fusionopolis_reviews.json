Every other Starbucks I've gotten my brewed coffee right after paying. I waited around for 5 minutes only to ask what was going on. They said it would be 5 minutes to brew.\n\nPoor service.\n\nThere are multiple coffee pots for a reason. And it's not for different blends. Every Starbucks usually only has one blend available at a time.\n\nThere is another coffee shop directly across that I would recommend instead.",
