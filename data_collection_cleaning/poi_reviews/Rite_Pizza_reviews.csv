Kennedy,1,"Thought you can't go wrong with Pizza. Quality dropped like mad, won't recommend to anyone. Disappointed Christmas meal.

See the colour of the crust, was very tough and very bland",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111840895145152855915/reviews
Abundance Chiang,1,"Ordered pizzas and garlic bread for dinner last week. The super spicy chicken pizza was super salty. Instead of spicy, the whole pizza tasted like someone poured a bottle of salt into the pizza rather. Tried another slice and it was the same saltiness. Had to throw the rest of the pizza away as it was way too salty. Very disappointing experience as we've been ordering from Rite Pizza for years and been recommending to our family and frens :(",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100781064793955179386/reviews
Jeroen Derks,1,"Ordered pizza first time from here.

This is the worst pizza I ever ate. Soggy and the taste was so bad, I only ate half of it.

Never order from here again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107586282714050658780/reviews
