Had dinner here with a few friends. We ordered pizza, fish and chips , lamp chop and beef steak. Except the pizza that was too salty. The rest are quite good. Will be back again.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104379740216436886242/reviews
Soo Wei Qiun,5,"I recently visited and had an amazing dining experience. I ordered the tomato seafood pasta, truffle mushroom pasta, and fresh oysters, and each dish was outstanding. The seafood pasta was loaded with fresh, tender seafood and had a rich, flavorful sauce. The truffle pasta was creamy and indulgent, with just the right amount of truffle to elevate the dish. As for the oysters, they were incredibly fresh, briny, and served perfectly chilled.

The service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was cozy and welcoming. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for high-quality seafood and pasta dishes. I'll definitely be returning soon!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103381027150104182099/reviews
Yee Yee,4,"A cozy cafe that offers a unique mix of Asian and Western dishes. Seafood Tom Yam Pasta is a creative concept, but the flavors didnâ€™t quite come together. The tom yam sauce was a bit too mild for my taste. The pork meat stuck to the bone, making it hard to eat. But, the ambiance was warm and inviting, perfect for casual dining.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104000004718761246100/reviews

Benedict Jacob-Thambiah,5,"We had 2 lunch sets, one pork adobo and the other sesame chicken. Both with pandan drinks.

The food was awesome. For a moment I felt I was in Makati and it made me miss my many trips to Manila.

Please keep up the good food and good service.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117230040794410296532/reviews
