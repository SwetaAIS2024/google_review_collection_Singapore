Waiting area is not necessarily big so try not to congregate there. Other than that drinks are affordable as usual",

      "text": "Great tea quality and rich flavours. Go-to would be the Jasmine Green Milk Tea. The tea is fragrant, smooth, and not overly sweet. Service was fast, and the ambiance at VivoCity is nice for a quick break. Prices are a bit on the higher side, but worth it for the quality. Definitely one of the better tea brands in Singapore.",

I ordered Jasmine Milk Tea here but didnt fit to my family taste, this Chagee place was so cool, there were some smell samples of their teas and so many young employees work here.\nNever saw place like this before. It was so crowded, many customers in queue and there were no place left to sit down.\n\nnext time I wanna try the Da Hong Pao milk tea, i hope the taste same or maybe better than Kungfu Panda \"Impression Da Hong Pao Milk Tea\" in Malaysia.",

The dine-in area is spacious, allowing patrons to enjoy their beverages in a pleasant and calm setting.\n\nHowever, the waiting time was surprisingly long. Despite visiting on a weekday, I had to wait for over an hour after placing my order. While the tea and overall ambiance are commendable, the extensive waiting time significantly detracts from the overall experience. Hopefully, they can improve the efficiency of their service in the future.",

      "text": "Finally a tea brand with nice 'cafe' setting.  Usually such possiblity is only available outside Singapore,and around SEA. And most tea brands feel they cannot earn enough profit if invest in seating stores. But tea drinkers know otherwise. Just look at the queues for BBt ðŸ¤·.Now finally we have a tea brand that serves amazingly good tea and willing to invest in seating stores for customers. The hype is real as much I was not really buying itðŸ¥´ðŸ˜…. But once you sit in,the comfort and fragrance of the fresh brews will convince you otherwise. Hopefully they continue to be a great brand and don't slack off like most coffee chains here.\n\nUpdate: as expected,they have to ruin the 1 thing that makes this branch a winner...by plastering their branding. Things don't really last. Nobody needs to see the patterns from the harbour side. Just let the patrons enjoy a good view",
