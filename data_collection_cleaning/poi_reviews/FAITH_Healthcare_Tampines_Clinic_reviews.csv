G. Yong,5,"Dr Clarence Chiang was amazing! Super professional and my persistent cough and cold was gone quickly after lasting for a week prior with another doctor.

I also went to him complaining about vertigo and earwax blockage, and after recommending Tropex for one week, I did ear syringing with Dr Chiang. He was super patient and kind during the process, made sure I was comfy and I had a stubborn piece that he persisted on. He went through multiple rounds to try his best to remove everything. I really appreciate his persistence. My ear canal is smaller than usual and it‚Äôs been blocked for a long time- so thank you Dr Chiang!

Shoutouts to Nura at Recep as well; she‚Äôs so sweet and smiling that you don‚Äôt feel so bad when you‚Äôre sick ‚ù§Ô∏è

a great experience thanks to these two.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105054611672519326538/reviews
Barbette Strauss,5,"One of our family members walked in for a booster jab with Sinopharm (paying).  The doctor who administered the jab did a good job as there was minimal pain and no scarring at the injection site.  Nurses at the counter were also very well trained and even with the high traffic of patients in the clinic, the whole vaccination process was rolled out pretty systematically.  Highly recommended for vaccination!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116995110127835257886/reviews

Skyman J,4,"I recently visited this medical clinic that left me with mixed feelings. While the doctors and the overall cleanliness of the facility were commendable, my experience with the clinical assistants was less than desirable.

The doctors at this clinic were truly exceptional. They exhibited a high level of professionalism, expertise, and empathy. Their ability to listen attentively and provide accurate diagnoses was truly impressive. I felt confident in their expertise and appreciated their thorough explanations of my condition and treatment options.

The facility itself was exceptionally clean and well-maintained. From the waiting area to the examination rooms, everything was spotless, creating a pleasant and hygienic environment for patients.

While I understand that clinical assistants have demanding roles, effective communication is vital in ensuring a smooth patient experience.

I recommend this clinic for their excellent medical care and clean facility. However, I hope that the clinic administration addresses the issue of communication with the clinical assistants to provide an even better patient experience in the future.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111603338203240007465/reviews
