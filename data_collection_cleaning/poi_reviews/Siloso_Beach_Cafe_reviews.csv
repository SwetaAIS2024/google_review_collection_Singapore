Zhou Lin,5,"The price is reasonable and the herbs are directly from their garden. Relaxed outdoor seating in beautiful garden by the beach.
Support the disabled staff. The atmosphere here is nice and you can watch peacocks walking around elegantly.
Hear the stories of the animals sharing the place and it's interesting.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108176626851283373888/reviews
wilson 777,5,"ONE OF THE BEST BURGERS I'VE HAD! Meat was well seasoned and I can taste the herbs, not just a plain beef patty. It was juicy and cooked to perfection, I dare say it's comparable if not better than shake shack that's nearby. Price wise it's reasonable. Service and staff was great! Looking forward to coming back for it again!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106930674266711884939/reviews
Patrick Loo,5,"This restaurant offers a delightful dining experience with friendly staff and great food. The Prata is a must-try; it’s traditionally made, puffy, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. The curry is well-cooked and flavorful. Additionally, the beef burger is highly recommended—the beef patty is juicy and perfectly seasoned. The set comes with waffle fries that remind us of our childhood snacks.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108020463241243379392/reviews
Toni is traveling,2,"The food is mediocre at best, couldn't eat all of it. Seating also not great, liked the garden vibe though.

The breakfast is very limited, some croissants, an egg/omlette and few fruits slices.

The staff was OK, no complaints here",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112092604242223846516/reviews
Oliver Griffith,2,Worst mie goreng ever - spaghetti with spicy ketchup. Almost as bad vegetable fried rice with frozen vegetables and no egg. At least not expensive for the area,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113492088862545722697/reviews
