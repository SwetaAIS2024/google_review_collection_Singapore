Tiramisooo Tiramisooo,4,"Anna deserves a reel-worthy moment. üòç

Tucked away in a cosy corner at Kent Ridge Road, Anna‚Äôs Sourdough x The Soup Spoon has been lingering in my mind ever since I first saw the cafe a few weeks ago.

The ambience in this little hideout is warm and inviting, with views of beautiful, lush greenery. The menu‚Äôs surprisingly extensive. I had the pulled beef burger with a bowl of hot tomato soup which made my belly very happy. üòä

Dessert was a sourdough cheesecake that I‚Äôm loving for all its cheesiness. The sticky date sourdough cake wasn‚Äôt quite my vibe, but I gave it a fair bite.

I‚Äôll definitely be back to visit Anna again, soon!
