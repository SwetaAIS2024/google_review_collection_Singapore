Seah Jia Hui,2,There’s student meal but you have to order at the counter. See my poster for info and don’t let them scam you. We had to insist to the counter that there was student meal because they didn’t believe us at first. But need to show id. Food is served out fast in 5 mins so that’s a plus. Hygiene wise.. I don’t know. We saw a baby cockroach crawling on another table….,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews

I just wanted to take a moment to express how truly touched I was by your kindness and thoughtfulness during my visit. It was heartwarming to see you reserve a table specifically for your staff to break their fast. This small but incredibly meaningful gesture speaks volumes about your character and the care you have for those around you.

It’s rare to come across such genuine consideration, and witnessing it firsthand made my experience at your Pepper lunch jurong point even more special. Thank you for not only serving food with such dedication but for also fostering an environment filled with compassion and respect.

Wishing you and your team continued blessings and success!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111476786433488375396/reviews

Joanne Kate,1,"The food is so so, while there is a chubby woman with spec waiter is rude as hell. I changed seat cuz the seat is exposed under the sun and hot, then she warned us cannot change table seat way so rude, as a customer I still don't have to right to choose a seat? Please train your staff how to serve first!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103755471052956867673/reviews
Alvin Li,3,"Pardon the not so appetising photo for this review.

Initially the payment system was weird because after ordering food on the QR menu and paying, you still have to line up at the cashier to get your pager and food. Months later, we can now order, pay on the QR menu and wait without moving from our seat.

I very much prefer this outlet to JEM due to the spacious and open dining area for air flow.

Recommendation? You can't go wrong with their beef pepper rice. What you order aside from this depends on how adventurous you are.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636040394390892825/reviews
