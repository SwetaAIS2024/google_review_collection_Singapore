      "text": "The outlet is clean and brightly lit. There is not much customers even though it was lunch hours as the renovation works might have blocked the restaurant. The noodles were served hot and rather promptly. The tables were cleared promptly too when I left.\n\nI could taste the five spice powered in the beef brisket noodles and the shallots added a flavour and crunch taste to the dish. The soup tasted more of that for duck noodles. Nonetheless, I love the soup so much that I finished drinking it.\n\nIt is not my first time here. I remember that it was pretty crowded during lunch hours previously and I had to wait to be seated.",

Seated us at a table with the baby chair already place there.\n\nOrdered food via the QR code and the food came quick which is good as we were starving. The garlic fried rice with onsen egg was very delicious. We also had the deep fried carrot cake, egg tart and chee chor fun. We paired with pu er and chrysanthemum tea.\n\nOverall food and service is excellent.",
