Gaik Ni Esther Lim,3,"They only accept cash and that’s the key reason causing the long queuing time! And don’t be alarmed if you see some of the customers rushing back to their friends/family to get the cash.
The price is reasonable and they have so many  varieties for us to choose. The food was fresh but they were too heavily and bluntly seasoned, and I could only taste salt, (lots of)peppers, oyster sauce and msg. The ambience was very nice with the live band performance. I would advise to go there early especially if you drive. They don’t have enough parking space, most cars had to park illegally along the double-lined roadside.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101838252163860150929/reviews
jayden,3,"Average BBQ skewers, seasoning to just feels like salt and pepper. Abit salty though, the shishamo is also not grilled enough, inside still soggy and outside burnt. In fact the skewers I ordered are mostly quite burnt on the outside layer... Not worth the price for such standard.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews

Mel T,5,"Very very flavorful!! First time here and ended up going back for a second order because it was too yummy! Their seasoning was on point and each stick was well cooked. Those that were supposed to be crispy were definitely crispy, those that were supposed to be tender were tender ❤️",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105447081530524428390/reviews
