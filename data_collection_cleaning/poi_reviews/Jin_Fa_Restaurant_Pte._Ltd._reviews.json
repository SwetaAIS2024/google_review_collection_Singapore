Especially on weekends, people who have just visited Macritchie Reservoir will come by after their morning walks. They have a few good stalls here, including the Sin Ming Roti Prata, the vegetarian food, the Popiah, and the chicken rice. The Sin Ming Roti Prata is especially crowded, but they're also worth every minute of waiting time!",
