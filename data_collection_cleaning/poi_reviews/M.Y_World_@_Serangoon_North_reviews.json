      "text": "Quite disappointed with the choice of this day care for our son. The teachers lacked empathy and patience. My son (who may be a tad more sensitive than most children his age) has complained multiple times of teachers being rude and partial towards other students. I would have brushed it off as his childish exaggeration, except I observed the behavior first hand. In some parent school engagements, I could visibly feel a difference in how the teachers would engage lovingly with local children but not so much with my son (we are foreigners). There was a marked mood change when they spoke to us vs. locals. In addition, I have had a teacher ask me \"what do you want me to do\" when I informed her that my sons pants were wet during pick up. Except for the spanking new campus and sweet and empathetic PG teacher Lynn, we were constantly disappointed during our 8 month stint with this establishment. This review is for the benefit of foreigner parents looking to enroll at this center.\n\nAdditional: I have since found out that another parent has also pulled out their child from the school on similar grounds. So it's definitely a systemic issue and not a personal experience.",
