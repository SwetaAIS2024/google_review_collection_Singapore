      "text": "Tong Sheng Bak Kut Teh has been a consistent favorite of mine for a few years already. the staff  are friendly and efficient who are always prompt with their service. Whether you prefer the cool comfort of the air-conditioned seating area or the more casual outdoor setting, there are options to suit your preference.  Bak Kut Teh is herbal Malaysia type and it boasts a wonderfully fragrant and flavorful broth that feels both comforting and nourishing. What's great is the flexibility to customize your bowl with your preferred ingredients, allowing you to create your perfect Bak Kut Teh experience.\n\nBeyond their signature dish, Tong Sheng also offers an array of other \"zichar\" style dishes. While I keep coming back for the Bak Kut Teh, the variety on offer suggests there's something for everyone.\n\nRecommended.",

      "text": "Went to here for lunch and tried their Signature Herbal Bak Kut Teh Soup (S) at $9.50 and Dry Bak Kut Teh (S) at $10.50.\n\nHonestly, this is one of the best herbal-style Bak Kut Teh I’ve had in Singapore, probably the closest you’ll get to the rich, robust flavours of Klang-style BKT. The soup was deeply herbal, layered with a complex blend of ingredients that gave it a warm, comforting depth. Plus, free soup refills are always a win.\n\nThe dry version was equally impressive, flavourful, with that signature salted fish aroma that adds an addictive umami kick. The sauce was thick and nicely caramelised, coating the meat beautifully.\n\nIf there’s one downside, it’s that the soup version came with relatively little meat and ingredients for the price. But flavour-wise? It’s definitely worth a visit.",

Kam heong pork meat is tender. Assam prawn is a must order dish. Finally, the egg & pork floss is packed with various ingredients. Price is reasonable. Only set back is portion is quite small. Overall worth to come by eating if happens to be nearby.",
