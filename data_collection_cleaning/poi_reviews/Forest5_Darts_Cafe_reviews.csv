Alex Ho,5,"Absolute must-visit for darts and karaoke lovers! With around 40 Dartslive boards, there‚Äôs plenty of space for both casual and competitive players. The atmosphere is lively yet comfortable, making it a great place to unwind. What sets this place apart is the private KTV room‚Äîperfect for those who want to enjoy singing with friends in a more exclusive setting. The staff are friendly, the drinks are great, and the overall experience is top-notch. Whether you're here for darts, karaoke, or both, Forest5 delivers an unforgettable night out. Highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107116371135942108310/reviews
Vanessa Lee,1,"2 staff with horrible service (working on the night shift on 15 Feb). For context, there was a total of 3 tables (including my group of friends - 6 of us) and the entire bar was almost empty. Firstly even though we purchased the darts live card, we were allowed to only get 2 sets of house darts and the reason is ‚Äúoh we usually do that‚Äù. Like hello?? We were willing to put deposit so why does that matter when your bar is totally empty. Secondly, karaoke system was turned off on our side and we had to shift to the other side of the bar just to select songs. I think don‚Äôt operate better, looking at the crowd it won‚Äôt last long too.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114954717602311695620/reviews
