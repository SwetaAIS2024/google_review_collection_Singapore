Andrew Lum,3,"Trail Update (as of 1 May 2025):
The gate connecting MacRitchie to Upper Peirce Reservoir is open and accessible via the trail from Venus Drive Carpark. The route passes through the grounds of the Singapore Island Country Club and leads to a quiet view of the reservoir. While the detour is peaceful, the fencing along the country club feels out of place in the otherwise natural setting. Upper Peirce itself is a small, quiet park with not much to explore",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110233780324113291357/reviews
Forest BK,5,"🌿Decided to hike to Upper Pierce Reservoir from Venus Drive, instead of from the usual Old Upper Thomson Road.
🍁Hike from Windsor Nature Park entrance as you would towards Tree Top Walk.
At the tarmac road just before Terentang Trail, enter into the fence gate.
This is where the Hiking Trail to Upper Pierce Reservoir begins.
🪟The access gate opens daily from 7am to 6pm.
🚜The Trail runs parallel to a private Island Club Road along the perimeter of the Singapore Island Country Club Golf Course.
🏵️The Trail is, for the most part, tarmac road all the way to the Upper Pierce Reservoir.
🐒🐒🐒Lots of monkeys at the trail.
Do not carry food in the open or eat on the trail. Confirm plus chop the monkeys will come after you.
🏵️Very serene and scenic trail to the Reservior as compared to approaching from the Old Upper Thomson Road.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Kane Cunico,3,The main gate to this part of the trail is closed. You can’t walk through it anymore. It’d be better for you to drop off at Windsor Park entrance as the gate on the country club road that connects to this point is locked.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108662215706446061508/reviews
