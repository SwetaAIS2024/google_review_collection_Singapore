On my follow up visit on 29 Nov night. He told me to go to A&E as he suspected my cough had became Pneumonia and he was correct. He told me if i was to visit the clinic in day time they could also send me to x ray but i went there at clinic closing time so i had to go to A&E.\n\nLast but not least both nurses at the counter are very patient, speak without rush, explain the medication to patients clearly and with a smile.\n\nI would return to this clinic if i am sick again.",
