Valerie Woo,4,"My MS teacher is Ms Mala, and she has helped me in math by understanding the topics well and helping me with the questions that I don't know. One thing I really like about her is that she is very patient and helpful, and she is also very kind towards us. Thank you for teaching us and sharing with us about your dog during breaktime, he seems really cute :) Happy Teachers' Day!!
