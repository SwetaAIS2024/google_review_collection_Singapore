Nor Danish,1,"974 is the worst bus service i have ever seen in these past few days. They sent 2 single deck bus on a peak hour, bus stop at Opp westwood Sec had at least 40-50 people waiting and most already waited for nearly an hour. There was a student worker recording the busses and another SMRT conductor at the bus stop. What a genuine waste of resources.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106925189498579991512/reviews

Serena Tan,2,"Bus 255 always delayed after 746am since late Sept. Reached early past few days for 752am bus, ended with taking 806am bus. And the Q got longer. Is there shortage of drivers due to Covid19 at Joo Koon bus interchange? If there is no route at 759am, pls remove it on the screen. So misleading and really not punctual. Please rectify bus 255 schedule time accurately. Thank you.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109730529671502053895/reviews
nafisah zulqifflie,1,"My colleague was waiting for her bus after work at 1030pm and was hungry so she wanted to take a bite of her bread when one bald guy in smrt shirt came screaming at her ""here can eat ah"". he repeated it a few times before stomping off leaving my friend confused and ashamed from the stares she was getting from ppl around. 1) he cldve said it nicely. 2) he SHOULDve said it nicely. 3) interchange cannot eat? then why have mini mart? understandable for mrt platforms as they always repeat the announcement not allowing people to eat.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101434013042174986667/reviews
