      "text": "Reasonably priced Korean food in National University of Singapore.  I believe owners are authentic Koreans as we spoke to the Korean uncle who was clearing the plates,\n\nFood was served fast as u queue and move along the line. The nice thing about it was probably the stall was situated n the air-conditioned part of the canteen, so u could eat in comfort. The hard part was looking for seats.\n\nYou also get to have a free Korean tea with your meal.",

      "text": "Hwang's is a gem for affordable and delicious Korean cuisine, offering a variety of options, including pork, chicken, beef, and fish. With all their sets priced below $10 (the most expensive being just $8.90), this is a budget-friendly spot for a satisfying Korean meal.\n\nDuring our visit, we tried the beef and pork belly sets, and both were excellent. The meat was tender, juicy, and packed with flavour. The accompanying seaweed soup was spot on, complementing the meal perfectly. As a bonus, I also sampled their Korean rice cake (tteokbokki), which was a pleasant surprise‚Äîsoft yet springy, with a texture and flavor that rival far pricier Korean restaurants that often fail to get it right.\n\nThe restaurant itself is spacious and comfortable, and even during peak hours, it wasn't overly crowded. This makes it an ideal spot for a relaxed meal without the hassle of long waits.\n\nIf you're looking for great Korean food at unbeatable prices, Hwangs is a fantastic choice. 8/10, highly recommended!",

      "text": "Good Korean food! My friend from Korea said the food is decent, with the ddukbaegi samgyebsal being the best dish. I enjoyed the chicken/beef + pork belly combo sets, and I like their new naengmyun. The free side dish of kimchi is small, but I think they're okay with you taking multiple. Worth a visit if you're craving Korean food!",
