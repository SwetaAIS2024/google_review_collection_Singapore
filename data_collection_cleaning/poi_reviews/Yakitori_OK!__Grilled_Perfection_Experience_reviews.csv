Tay Boon Siang,5,"This is not a solicited review. Staff is very friendly when I brought for the first time today. Food is pretty surprisingly good! Will try again. I tried all types of chicken skewers.

But the display food looks very unappetising. I feel can be improved. Just honest feedback.

Edit: Revisited it again today, same friendly staff, and same great taste!!! It’s starting to become my favourite place to eat.

Edit 2: I have eaten here 10 over times and the quality never drops. Highly recommend!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107725356135621793247/reviews
Chantal T,5,"So delicious. Friendly service. Order and freshly grilled on the spot, some waiting time required. I love that they gave kimchi instead of Japanese pickles. There’s a small seating area at the side.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101758428229172238147/reviews
