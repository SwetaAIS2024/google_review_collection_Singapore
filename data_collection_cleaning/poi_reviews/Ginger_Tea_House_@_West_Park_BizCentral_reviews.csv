Bizley,4,"Very big industrial building. Depending on your location, mobile reception is sometimes limited.

Directions in carparks can be improved, especially the lifts. Cos depending on which part of the building, it can be levels 1-11 and the other starts at 1, 2, 2M and so on. So for visitors, it‚Äôll be confusing.

2 canteens to choose from.
Canteen 1 = Ginger Tea House
Fully air conditioned and also mean you‚Äôll smell like a canteen too.

Food wise, the chicken rice is a definite to go for stall. Economical rice is not too bad, although the ‚Äúeconomical rice‚Äù may no longer be a valid statement.

Former Malay stall is good, the current one is so-so. If you‚Äôre feeling rich, go for the Ayam penyet and you‚Äôll get cutthroat price at $8 üò±

Personally, I‚Äôll give the Thai and Japanese food a miss.

The beverage is so-so with the coffee kinda thin. Currently, the beverage stall is doing a price match against canteen 2.

Personally, I‚Äôll patronise canteen 1 under ‚Äúforced circumstances‚Äù.

Canteen 2 = MX Cafe
Non aircon, more choices for Chinese food.

Downside, no Malay food and just 1 Indian stall.

Beverage is definitely way better.

The second time I ate mee soto, it was mediocre. Not to mention the drinks are very pricey. üò§",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100494635038017339069/reviews

L Wong,4,"Canteen is very clean and airy. Excellent!  This is added point for me.  With aircon and additional ceiling fans. Served good traditional coffee. I tried mee rebus and long tong from the malay stall. Long tong is very good, the vegetable curry well done. Hubby said the chicken rice next to this malay stall is good too. The economical rice stall has a lot of variety, looks good but i can't eat anymore. üòÖ  Got to come back and try the Indian food too!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105052490586738746635/reviews
