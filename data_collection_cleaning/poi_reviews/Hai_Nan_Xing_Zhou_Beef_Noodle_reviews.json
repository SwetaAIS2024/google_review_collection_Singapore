      "text": "Quality of their beef noodles is high, but probably not something that I'll specially travel and visit, just to grab a bowl of. It's good, but not mind-blowing for me.\n\nIn this time and age, I appreciate the fact that they serve all the different beef tendons and parts of the cow, given that the preparations take a lot of effort, and it's extremely difficult to do it right.\n\nWe ordered the sliced beef, beef balls, stomach, and tendons dry beef noodles. I really like the bowl of soup, with the rich flavors and umami that it comes with. The only thing I didn't like as much of, was the thickness of the sauce; could perhaps enjoy the soup version of the noodles slightly better. That said, for 7 SGD, and the fact that it's award winning, you can't really complain.",

Go for beef noodles dry with everything all in and ask for a big bowl soup to taste the sweet, savory beefy taste of the soup and the nice gravy on the noodles.",
