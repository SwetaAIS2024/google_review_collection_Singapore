      "text": "Review of [Fishball Noodles- Q Prawn Noodles]\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at a fantastic fishball noodles stall, and I must say, it was an absolute delight. The food served here is not only delicious but also offers great value for money.\n\nThe fishballs were incredibly fresh, boasting a springy texture and rich, savoury flavour that stood out with every bite. The noodles were perfectly cookedâ€”al dente with just the right amount of chewiness, complemented by a flavourful broth that was both aromatic and comforting.\n\nWhat truly sets this stall apart is the perfect balance of flavours and the generous portions provided at an affordable price. The ingredients were fresh, and the attention to detail in preparation was evident.\n\nIf you're on the lookout for a satisfying and budget-friendly meal, I highly recommend giving this fishball noodles stall a try. Itâ€™s a true gem that delivers both taste and value.",

      "text": "Been ordering the prawn noodles with sliced pork regularly for many years.\nThe auntie is generous with her ingredients. She give whole prawns, not halved and thick slices of pork. It is really value for money for $5.50 a bowl and she hardly increases the price.\nThe prawn broth is well balanced and tastes very traditional. The pork lard is crispy!\nSometimes, the dry noodles can taste overly oily and the pork lard is slightly burnt but it's okie. You can tell the auntie you want less oil and just discard the burnt piece(s) of pork lard.",

      "text": "Despite the rating, this is still one of my favourite prawn noodle to satisfy my cravings. Fresh big prawn and peeled. Nice flavorful soup and tender pork rib at a reasonable price. I would highly recommend....try it and judge yourselves. Considering the inflation and raising price everywhere, please empathise with our hawker the price increase to survive at the level they desire. Not even sure if our next generation can enjoy such cheap and nice food in time to come. Enjoy the moment! ðŸ˜€",

No regrets and itâ€™s definitely worth it!\n\nWe had no.4 prawn mee and mee hoon dry.\nAbsolute delight! The noodles were perfectly cooked, firm and springy. The prawns were fresh and succulent, adding a delightful seafood flavor to every bite.",
