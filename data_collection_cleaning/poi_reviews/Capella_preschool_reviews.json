      "text": "A preschool built on values, love, respect for children and partnerships with parents.  Staff at Capella Preschool truly value each individual child’s needs and their learning styles.  They place extra effort (to partner alongside us parents) to understand each child’s uniqueness… preparing them for future learning, but more importantly preparing them for life.\n\nEngage, Explore, Evaluate is their motto. Teachers not only plan the lessons meticulously, but also set up the classroom environment to engage each child holistically 1-1.  Both my children were guided and loved by the principal and preschool educators now in Capella Preschool (Sims Urban Oasis) and I'll be the first to say, my two children have had the happiest, most joyful memories of learning even till today.  If you are in search for a QUALITY early childhood education provider with a HEART… Capella Preschool is it !",
