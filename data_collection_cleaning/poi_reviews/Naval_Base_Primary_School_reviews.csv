Mei Bao,3,"Tbh I love the school and this review is coming from a sec one student who just graduated from primary school last year.

Overall, Nbps is a school where A LOT of drama happens. And you WILL get to see all types of students in this school. You will get to experience being bullied in this school but if you can stand up to yourself, you can survive in this school and continue learning without anything bothering you.

Otherwise, prepare to get bullied for a year.

The school facilities are good but a little run down and the staff and teachers are pretty nice as well",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105643359777765727483/reviews

zuzzori,3,"I was a student at Naval base, just graduated, do I recommend it? If your child is mentally and physically strong then yes but if not prepare to get bullied by the high ego kids who think of themselves only, other than that alot of the teachers are supportive and nice, especially the teachers who are parents and also the canteen is clean enough i guess, stall aunties are great aswell, overall some facilities are VERY outdated but i had an okay time here and im not too proud to say i was a student here but hey what can you do right? It is what it is.
Recommend for kids who can bear to be bullied and can stand up for themselves and not be influenced by the naughty ones.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114005293448381632616/reviews
meow mochi (meowmagicc),4,"Tbh, the school is nice. The counselors are patient, the teachers are not bad, some are pretty rude and strict but of course, every school has those types of teachers. The students here are chaotic(I'm a student, some parts may be biased but I'll try to wrote this with full honestly and from true experiences). There are a lot of kids that are becoming more rude and egoistical. A lot of us that go to other places like the playground tend to be loud and annoying for some. There are so many incidents where kids were reported by the residents living near by. But most students here are willing to improve so there are many good role models for your child.I appreciate this school and treasure it with my heart. I'll surely remember this school, the teachers that helped me, my friends and the activities and effort they put into making us happy. To my p3 English teacher, thank you so much for guiding me and getting me out of the deep dark pit of my family's situation. Recommend yippee:3

The teachers here suck.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108889331278645187546/reviews
