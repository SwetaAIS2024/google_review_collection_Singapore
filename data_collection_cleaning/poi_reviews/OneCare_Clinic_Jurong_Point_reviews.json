Although the clinic was full of patients, the nurse helped me first to dress my wound, and advised me to go to ED as my wound was too big to settle in clinic. The staff were friendly and efficient, there was no waiting, and it's wonderful that the CA/ Nurses were able to help out the Dr during the busy period to ensure patients get timely care.",
