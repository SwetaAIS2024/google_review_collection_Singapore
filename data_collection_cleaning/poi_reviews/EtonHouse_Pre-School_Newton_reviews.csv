Yuiko Murakami,5,"Both of my daughters were in Etonhouse Newton, and they LOVED their  school. I was so sad that we had to leave because of relocating back home, but the teachers were caring for my kids until the last day of school so well. We are missing all the teachers a lot!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107937420671195563620/reviews
廣瀬龍太,5,"I am a graduate of EtonHouse Newton. I recently visited there for the first time in about 20 years, and the interior had been renovated and was very clean. The children attending are diverse, and they seem to be having a lively time while learning various languages ​​and cultures.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109097745377339370718/reviews
J,1,"As parents at Etonhouse Newton, we chose this school for its promise of quality education and a supportive learning environment. Unfortunately, our experience has been disappointing. Despite assurances of a student-teacher ratio of no more than 1:10, we've found that teachers in my child's class have less than 50% attendance, leading to overcrowded classrooms. Our concerns have gone largely unaddressed, as the administration prioritizes their vacation schedules over responding to parents. Instead of hiring additional staff to ensure proper education, Etonhouse cuts costs, compromising our children's safety. This raises the question: Is this truly a school that puts students first? Every child deserves attentive care and a safe environment. We encourage other parents to consider whether silence serves our children’s best interests. Let us unite and advocate for our children’s safety and rights. If you have faced similar issues at Etonhouse, please report them to the Ecda to help secure a better future for all our children.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104840265634300180133/reviews
