syaFika chu,1,"Hi,i Wanted to share an incident today at lakeside mrt station toilet at around 8:30pm,I bring my mom to the toilet. As my mom was handicapped it took a while for her in the toilet .The lady(indian cleaner) came in and want to wash the toilet.She didn’t told us first hand that we need to get out of the toilet, the lady then waited around 5 min.She suddenly voiced out “keluar la orang nak cuci.” with her unhappy face and rude tone.
We also told her that we inside the toilet not to play but to assist our mother. She then said that we were “lambat” she said that she has a timing to wash the toilet. Then a few people came in to the toilet then my mom said to her, why she let them in if she got timing to wash and she said that is because we were still inside the toilet… throughout the incident her face was very unhappy.

We do understand her situation that she has a timing to clean, but her tone and expression and the way she told us is very rude.

Please look into this matter especially her, if she done it to us she might do it to others in the future.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115527453345206456842/reviews

Jonathan Rou Sun,1,"Currently, there are temporary toilets outside the MRT Station as the permentant toilet is closed for renovation. Those temporary toilets are very smelly and every day I walked past I could smell how bad it was. I wish SMRT could do something to speed up the renovation work for the toilet ? It has been 3 weeks the toilets are closed. I wonder what contractors were they and why are they taking so long.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111308024624491796222/reviews
