OUYA77,5,"After coming to Singapore for a month, I looked for a nearby Korean church and ended up holding a service here. It was full of the grace of the Word and praise, and the meal fellowship system after the service was also great🥰 I will support you even when I return to Korea so that God’s grace will be even more abundant in the Word of Life Church🙌",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105131297239464375835/reviews
