Lee Yee Jiat,5,The red braised pork belly scallion oil noodle IS SUPER GOOD. The noodle is so fragrant and the pork fat just MELTS in your mouth. The real hidden gem. Only takeaway though but so worth it.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109331950528961862464/reviews
Eve W,5,"tried the minced meat butter garlic noodles today and loved it! you can taste the fragrant butter, and the garlic is not too overpowering. opted for little bit of chilli and it really completes the overall flavour. a very comforting bowl of noodles.

meat portion can be small for guys with larger appetites. maybe 2 pax can order 1 noodle dish then add on extra meat to balance out the carbs and proteins.

also can be a tad oily but i’m ok with it. pair with a refreshing drink like iced lemon tea and it’s a shiok meal.

only randomly discovered it on grab by searching “noodles”. not sure why i never saw the listing before today. glad i gave it a shot.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101446499316168538102/reviews
