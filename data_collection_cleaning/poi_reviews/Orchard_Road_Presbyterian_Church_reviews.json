      "text": "A very old church in singapore, built all the way back to 1878, being the oldest Presbyterian church in singapore. Initially it was built for the Scottish community, but gradually caters to a congregation of different backgrounds. There are multiple services, while the english marina service is at sunday 9am and afternoon (two per week) there are also chinese service.\nPersonally i found the design of the church very attractive, and i would rank it as one of the most appealing churches in singapore (both exterior and interior) somehow it's built next to a small hill, and all those plants surrounding makes it so delicate. The teaching is quite traditional and the atmosphere is conducive, both staff and pastries are very helpful and enlightening ( pastor in their suits look really professional) their choir is also very decent.\nI would recommend this church to all of you even if you are just a vistor (can walk in without anyone asking or pestering anything) enjoy~",
