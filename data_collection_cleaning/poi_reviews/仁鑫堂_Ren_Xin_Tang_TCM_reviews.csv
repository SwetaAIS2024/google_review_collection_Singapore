Neo Paul,5,"I recently had a bone setting session with Kelvin and was genuinely impressed by his professionalism and skill. From the start, he took the time to understand my concerns and explained the process thoroughly, which helped me feel at ease.

Kelvin's technique is precise and confident — you can tell he has deep knowledge of body mechanics and alignment. During the session, he addressed areas of stiffness and discomfort I had been struggling.

After the session, I felt a noticeable improvement in my posture, reduced tension in my lower back and neck, and greater mobility overall.

Highly recommend Kelvin if you're looking for an experienced and effective bone setting therapist who truly understands the body. I’ll definitely be returning for follow-up sessions.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111164077168650373841/reviews

Lin Zhou Ao,5,"Contacted via WhatsApp during lunchtime, and they replied very promptly!

The clinic was clean and tidy. Consultant Mr. New Chin Ker was extremely patient and knowledgeable, offering a straightforward diagnosis without any gimmicks and gave me advices like a caring dad.

After acupuncture, I proceeded to the bone setting, handled by Michael. All I can say is, don't worry, you are in good hands. He knows what he is doing and doesn't yank it out for the sake of it. He ensures that you relax and then slowly loosens your joints.

Overall, it was a good experience. There was no hard selling, just an honest diagnosis.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102716679307168225751/reviews
