Doreen Goh,1,"First time encounter such food. I clearly order pattaya kway teow and they serve this to me. The egg is fry like pancake, looks so dry and not appetizing...

Next, the waitress took away our menu without our consent. We clearly mentioned that we wants the menu for further orders!

I strongly don't recommend this outlet if u guys wish go have a good supper. Is really disappointing with such service",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116279407945551341024/reviews
Nana,1,Menu is deceiving. Ordered Coin Prata with Chicken Curry (Menu Item) delivery but was given coin prata with curry gravy (chicken flavour) only. Checked with delivery company and they say it's only with gravy (without chicken). There's no meat despite the expensive price ($10++) of the coin prata set (6 pcs coin prata). Very disappointing.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106619761491547267078/reviews
