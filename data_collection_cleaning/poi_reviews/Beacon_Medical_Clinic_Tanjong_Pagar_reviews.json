Quite convenient to go to, barely 5mins away from the MRT.\n\nThe clinic has just renovated and it seems quite nice but thankfully the prices are still reasonable in my opinion.\n\nThey have Blood tests, Xray and Ultrasound services. Makes it very convenient for helper to come and get her 6ME.\n\nDr Kong is quite approachable and doesn't hard sell her products. And she is also knowledgeable too.",

Told me to back to take the report 3-4 days later due to Dr is on leave, she even said when the report ready will give a call, but did not mention the delay of taking report may have a change of 10 dollars delay fee.  I texted official whatsapp 1 week later due to not receiving phone call, the next day when I go take the report, the same front desk staff told me have to pay 10 dollars.  She argued with me she surely told me.  I said I would pay if you told but you not even mentioned.  In the end I guess she found she was wrong because I didn‚Äôt sign on the agreement.  She kept murmuring ‚Äúok ok forget about ‚Äú. The attitude is very annoying.",
