Her passion and dedication to organic gardening stands apart  as she guided us step-by-step on cultivating our own kitchen garden. Anna's eco-friendly practices and personal anecdotes made the session fun and resonated deeply highlighting the importance of sustainability.  I highly recommend this workshop to anyone looking to learn not just gardening, but also ethical resource usage.",

      "text": "This is an amazing workshop. Anna has really put in a lot of passion & effort in teaching how to grow our own kitchen garden,  organic vegetables & greens without any pesticides or fertilisers. Anna explains everything beautifully with lot of her own experiences from her childhood and patiently details the minor steps that will go a long way in growing healthy plants.  Itâ€™s not only about gardening, but also about recycling, reusing & how to be gentle on our Mother Earth.  I really wish lot of kids can also attend her sessions, so that our next generation will not lose the value of utilising our resources ethically.\nI found the session meticulously well planned. My daughter also attended the kids workshop and was very happy about her learnings.  She started appreciating every little thing on earth. I highly recommend this workshop to everyone, irrespective of the age group !",
