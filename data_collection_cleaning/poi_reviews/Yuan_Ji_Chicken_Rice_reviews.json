      "text": "Had ordered roast duck and charsiew rice. Portion of the duck was miniscule, which made me wonder if it was a one-off or if it was a different person behind the counter. Because every other time I've eaten here, they serve a good of meat. And at $5.50, you'd expect a decent amount of meat. So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered a second plate of duck and roast pork rice. To my horror, the portion was the same; measly. If you look at the picture, you can see the amount of duck they gave me in my second plate; more skin than meat, and the slices are small and flattened to absolute smithereens. A travesty.",

Quite generous with the lard bits and sambal chilli and the chilli is quite decent for wanton mee. I added some ginger into the wanton noodles and it tasted decently acceptable.",
