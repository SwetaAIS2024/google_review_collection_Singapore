teawithpearls 26,1,"I had a terrible experience at this outlet. It was 3:20 PM, and the place was nearly empty, with just one other customer besides me. The two kitchen staff (one male, one female) were incredibly rude, except for Gan at the cashier, who was polite while taking my order.

Since it was my first time here, I wasn’t aware that the collection point was at the side, as my view was blocked by a pillar and a bin. I kept hearing my number being called repeatedly but saw nothing being served at the front, so I assumed there was a problem with the machine. Instead of simply informing me, the staff just kept pressing the buzzer. Worse still, the female staff member came out, looked at me, and walked away without saying anything.

When I finally went to collect my order, the male staff member took the receipt from my tray and crushed it without any acknowledgment. I commented on the poor service, but neither of them bothered to apologize. This was by far the worst service I’ve experienced at this chain—I’ve never had such issues at other outlets like Oasis Terrace.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117140257350254450459/reviews

Beary Beary,5,"Quiet Afternoon Coffee

This outlet makes its coffee better than other Fun Toast outlets I have tried in the past. The service is excellent here. Place is quite empty for a coffee place in the afternoon at 4pm. So it’s a great place to have a quiet coffee by yourself or a chat with a friend in a quiet place.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101788329090998743221/reviews

RCSC,4,"Had iced yuan yang and set 9 soy sauce chic w ccf. Drink was good. Had coffee taste and was not overly sweet. Soy sauce chic was a letdown. Not much taste. Came with 4 wings and 1 egg.

There was 10% surcharge for CNY Day 3 in 2024.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101381356185028377091/reviews
