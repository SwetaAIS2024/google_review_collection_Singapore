Sei Juro,5,"Nice & Delicious Vegetarian Sweet & Sour Pork Rice! üçõüòã. (Stall : Red Apple Vegetarian)

Its pork is crispy & yet soft paired with a balanced sweet sour sauce and freshly cut ü•í+üçç+ü´ë+ü•¨. It's been a while since I've come across such a Vegetarian stall. Highly recommended!

Price wise a bit high side but still decent & is quite filling though.

Remember to order the Kopi-C siu dai, it's coffee really good. The right balance and intoxicating ‚òï aroma ü§§

1. Came back again for Hor Fun this time. Not so bad but still got room for improvement ( Not piping hot as the sauce just drenched over it w/o cooking together with the Hor Fun, hence the texture not soft  & smooth enough to complement. )",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100816457077830774823/reviews
Jonathan Koh,4,"This coffee shop offers some of the finest coffee I've ever tasted. The service is exceptional, with the owner and staff always attentive and proactive in taking orders. Additionally, their Thai cuisine is a must-try, especially the flavorful Tom Yam soup and a variety of other delectable dishes. The roast duck is another highlight, though it's worth noting they close at 2 pm. I've also heard rave reviews about their vegetarian options, and it's clear they have a dedicated fan base, though I have yet to sample them myself.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110322417305771163637/reviews
