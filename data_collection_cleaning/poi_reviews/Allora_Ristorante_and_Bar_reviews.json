They both are really tasty and the natural spices complement the salmon or chicken.\nPortion is large compared to other hotel fine dining restaurants.\nService is great as the staff are mostly friendly Filipino and very hospitable!\nThis restaurant deserves 5 stars!",

      "text": "I was drawn by the positive reviews on Google and decided to try the afternoon tea set.\n\nDespite the restaurant being way less than half full, the service was disorganised and notably slow. It was difficult to get the attention of the staff, and I waited 40 minutes for the afternoon tea set to be served — quite disappointing.\n\nThe only redeeming point was that the staff accommodated my request to replace one of the sweets with an alternative. However, the ladyfingers in the tiramisu were much too dry. While the rest of the food was generally enjoyable, the level of service falls short of expectations, especially for a restaurant located in the World’s Best Airport Hotel and Best Airport Hotel in Asia.",
