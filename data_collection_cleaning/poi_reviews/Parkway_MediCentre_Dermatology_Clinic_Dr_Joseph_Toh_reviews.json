During my first visit Dr Toh thoroughly explained how to take better care of my skin, all the available treatments and we chose a comprehensive treatment plan (dupixent + skin care) suitable for me.  After 2 months my eczema is 80% improved and getting better each week.  Very happy with the results and Iâ€™ve had a very good experience at the clinic.  Dr Toh is very knowledgeable and professional, and staff is courteous and fast!",
