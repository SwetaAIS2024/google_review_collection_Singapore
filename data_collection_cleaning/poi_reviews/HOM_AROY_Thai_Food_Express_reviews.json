      "text": "Tom Yum Fried Rice Review\n\nThe tom yum fried rice leaned on the sweeter side, lacking the bold aroma you'd expect. The rice itself was a bit soggy, which took away from the ideal texture.\n\nIngredient wise, it was decent featuring three medium sized fresh prawns, which were a nice touch.\n\nOverall, the dish was just okay, and the price was reasonable for what you get. However, if you're looking for that strong, fragrant tom yum flavor, this might not hit the mark.",

      "text": "+ This is the hawker centre branch of the main Hom Aroy restaurant hidden gem in Coronation Plaza.\n\n+ Has strong competition from the Blk 22 Lor 7 TPY hawker centre and 3 other coffeeshops nearby, but it's the only Thai stall in the immediate area, and the cheapest among the other Thai outlets in TPY which tend to be more of restaurant formats.\n\n- They don't open everyday, and is usually closed on Sat, unless their parent HQ at Coronation Plaza has spare manpower (on Sat), or there's a big order to fulfil (like mine for a home gathering).\n\n+ Price menu as indicated in photos. My order for 12 pax was:\n\n1. Tom Yum Soup ($6 w 2 prawns) x 3 = ($18) (sweeter than other stalls)\n\n2. Fishcake 6pc ($7) x 3 = ($21) (pieces were small)\n\n3. Pandan chicken 4pc ($8) x 4 = ($32) (pieces were small)\n\n4. Basil Pork ($10) x 3 = ($30) (Not salty quite salty enough)\n\n5. Green Curry Chicken ($8) x 3 = ($24) (gravy not quite thick enough)\n\n6. Fried baby kailan w minced pork ($8) x 3 = ($24)\n\n7. Mango salad ($7)\n\n8. Steamed prawns w Glass Vermicelli ($15) x 2 = ($30) (This dish is very good @@)\n\n9. Omelette Crab ($12) x 2 = ($24)\n\n10. Olive Prawn Fried Rice ($5) x 4 = ($20)\n\n- You cannot customise dish size (e.g. $20 of Tom Yum Soup). You have to order in multiples of the dish (e.g. $6 x 3 soup portions) due to POS (Point of Sale) system limitation.\n\n- I tried to give them early warning at first, by placing the order 5 days ahead on a Monday evening (go around 7:30pm, after the dinner peak crowd), but was told this was not possible at first by the youngish Thai lady cashier (the one famous for being curt?). After much probing, it turned out that they \"change staff\" for the stall every weekend, so they \"cannot handover order\". But given that I dun intend to come down another 2 times (once on gathering day morning to order and another that evening to collect food), I pushed for and the non-English-speaking Thai granny chef kindly came out to say it's OK. With that, I was able to place my early order and only needed to place a $50 deposit for the $230 order.\n\n- I also wanted to pass them my 9 big plastic containers + 1 thermo pot (for soup), to which the cashier lady was initially reluctant to accept, saying they dun have the space for them. This is important to me cos otherwise, the big containers cost $2 each and that means a $20 extra fee for 10 dishes. Again, after much cajoling, she acceded cos there's not other practical alternative (I seriously didn't want to come down 3 times, and the food has to be ready for collection on actual day).\n\n+ Towards the end, after placing my deposit, I recorded photos and a video of the order form and what containers I had passed on to them. Surprisingly, the lady cashier gave me a cute peace sign pose when the camera came to shine on her :-D\n\n+ Collection day was smooth with final payment made in cash.\n\n+ While I have had better Thai food elsewhere, the stall does offer unbeatable value for money, especially for large gatherings. The main restaurant at Coronation Plaza is also worth a try, with its extensive and authentic Thai decor.",

The service was also good\n\nThe only feedback about this whole experience was that the food centre was rather stuffy and uncomfortable.",

      "text": "Certainly not worthy of the 1 star review that it had previously, given the slow but steady crowd on a weekday evening.\n\nFood were actually great, ordered 2 main dishes and although leaving without the fullest stomach, the taste was good and we would return for sure üëçüèª\n\nBasil pork was the better deal of the 2 we ordered, lightly spicy for us and it has a decent portion of pork, coupled with a runny egg too.\n\nThe fried vermicelli was very well seasoned, though there‚Äôs only 3 prawns and some leafy on the side - not that great at $5 but still tasty nonetheless.\n\nWe will be back to try the other options or just hit the Basil pork in future üëçüèª",
