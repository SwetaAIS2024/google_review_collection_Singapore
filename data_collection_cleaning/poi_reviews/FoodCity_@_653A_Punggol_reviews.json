I know the stall is called 泰姐辣椒面 but still really disappointed if elderly people or young kid want to eat is very difficult for them. Need some improvement.\n\n(no.6 mee pok dry $5.80)the ingredients only have pork slice and meatball.\n\n(No.6A mee tak mak dry $5.80) only have pork liver and meatball.\n\nOther bak chor mee stall at least have fishball, meatball, pork liver, mushroom and fishcake for only $4.80\n\nWould not recommend to others\n\nBut can try the porridge that's is right beside the economy rice the porridge is nice and affordable. Really would recommend that.",

      "text": "Solely made this post for the indian food. For months I put up with their behaviour as their only saving grace is their mutton murtabak and roti john, but they will always up sell and try to push things you don’t want. One second theres no mutton, suddenly there’s mutton available only for a certain dish. They will say Mutton Murtabak only have large size, no regular size, what kind of logic is that???\n\nPrice says 6 for Nasi Goreng, will push for chicken nasi goreng for $8. I insist on ikan bilis nasi goreng, with egg, dish ends up with just nasi goreng and egg and some chilli ketchup. plain, bland, nothing good. Avoid at all cost.\n\nYou tell me, looks good?",
