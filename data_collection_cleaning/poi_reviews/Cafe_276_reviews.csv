Beany Deany,3,"Variety of foods available.

Kenny Pan (KP),2,"Very neighborhood coffeeshop. Many food stalls in and out. Only surviving stalls like fishball noodle stall, yong tau foo stall and 2 Muslim stalls. The rest can not make it the standard of local cuisine. They are able to hang on today due to there is only 1 coffee shop to go. Tenderbest came, initially the food ok then later standard goes bad. Spagiti cost more ex than small piece of chicken meat. New player for chicken rice stall, the roast and white chicken at least much better cooked than the previous ones. But the chicken rice has to improve.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101635814406382146864/reviews
