XU ZAIQIANG,5,"My daughter attended JCK Kindergarten, and it has been a wonderful journey for both her and our family. The teachers are responsible, passionate, and truly dedicated to the children’s growth. After moving house, my second daughter had to attend a different childcare center, and that’s when I realized how special JCK is — not only in terms of education but also in providing a healthy environment. At JCK, my daughter fell sick much less often. I would highly recommend JCK Kindergarten to any families living around the area!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112482215642893890968/reviews

LittleBeeHouse Jae,5,"Thank you JCK for nurturing my son to where he is today. We are so glad of our decision to let him study here.

We have only enrolled our son to JCK K1 and were thankful for the accommodation and understanding that the teachers gave to allow him a place in K1 Blue. We were keen to let him study in JCK after hearing reviews from his cousins’ mom and once we did, the rest were history.

Indeed, we have seen the transformation of my son and are happy to see him going to school excitedly and happily every morning. We believe his teachers (Ms Anna, 刘老师 and Mrs Mari) must have done wonders and are able to engage the kids such that my son enjoys his school time so much. Apart from academic, the school have other activities like music, gym, art craft lessons. We are impressed by the group art work (be it using reycled items or other themes) done by the class and this definitely allows my son to learn about teamwork and respecting other classmates’ opinions.

This year, we have decided to enrol him to K2 S-T-E-A-M programme and once again the school has accommodated to our request and this allows him to gain more friendships which he truly treasures and enjoys. We are grateful and thankful that Teacher Marvis has helped him transit smoothly and also triggered his curiosity for Science which he will share with us eagerly. We are appreciative of the learning videos that were sent too.

Thank you JCK for giving my son a memorable fun Kindergarten experience and nurturing him. Also, a gratitude to all JCK teachers for the effort and preparation to make the students happy during each celebratory occasions!
