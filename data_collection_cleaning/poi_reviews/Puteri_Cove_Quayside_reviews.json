The roof maintenance work takes almost half year still not completed and the elevator always malfunctioned. And some rules are ridiculous, eg: my friend’s car cannot park overnight at the visitor’s parking spot. So what’s the purpose of the visitor parking spot? The space there so empty and yet not allowed someone to park overnight.",

One has to come here to experience it. If you are looking for hustle and bustle of things then I suggest you head for JB. This is a place for relaxation of the mind and to slow things down.
