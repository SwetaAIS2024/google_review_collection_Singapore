Cecelia,5,"Nice Ban Mian at an assuming corner of Tampines. Definitely one of the tastier ones around. Consistent with the Qiu Lian branding, serving bowl is big size with lots of soup, vegetables and crunchy anchovies. Will be awesome if they offer ke ko mian type of noodles too.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117470772597466912483/reviews
