Lynette Koh,3,"Got an iced matcha latte for dine-in. They served it in a disposable cup (they mentioned non-disposable cups are only for hot drinks). Was quite disappointed because how not eco-friendly‚Ä¶ I would‚Äôve brought my tumbler if I knew :( Though they use paper straws‚Ä¶ The matcha latte was grainy and milky, not worth 5.20 in my opinion. I would probably recommend getting other drinks which i‚Äôve heard other people rave about (chai latte/honey latte). They have a lot of seats inside the cafe with charging spots to do work here though. But I really hope they stop using disposable cups for iced dine-in drinks‚Ä¶",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104610856914755333480/reviews
Heartyheart,5,"Our always to go place to get good coffee in NUS ! Their Hojicha Oat Milk is really good too, and I love their straws",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102082257162676219106/reviews
CK C,4,"Revisited after two years, and found that the coffee is still as great, probably the best on NUS campus. Taste of pastries have improved. However, very disappointed that the food and beverages are now served in disposables by default, even for dine-in. But do note that the hot drinks can be served in ceramics by request.

This cafe is located conveniently just beside the bus stop. Place was bright and clean place with both indoor and outdoor seatings. Staff were very polite too.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Chin Dawn,3,decided to try the matcha recently for the first time and it was so bad.. it was so grainy you can even see the grains throughout the drink and sediments at the bottom of the cup because the matcha is so low grade it can‚Äôt mix well. the matcha was also so diluted and it tasted like flavoured milk more than anything. it‚Äôs also not due to the staff as i saw that they prepared the matcha properly and they redid my drink for me and sifted the matcha as well but it still ended up really grainy.. i would really suggest to use a higher grade matcha because for $5.20 it‚Äôs really quite a rip off and it‚Äôs the worst matcha i‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶ especially in recent times where matcha is becoming more of a thing i‚Äôm quite sure consumers will be hugely disappointed by this standard of matcha which is unreasonable at this and any price point.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100546214105763621340/reviews
