On their screen shows, bus 85 was arriving in 6 minutes. Me and a few others stood there waiting like a bunch of idiots, 6 minutes later, it says arriving and later switches to arriving in 8 minutes. As per usual, their reply to my feedback is that we will look into this matter and proceeds to do nothing.",

The bus driver closed the front door while my son was still going up the bus. The bus door hit my sonâ€™s cello which he was carrying on his back and the impact of the door closing cracked the cello. Anyone knows where can I file a complaint over this matter?",
