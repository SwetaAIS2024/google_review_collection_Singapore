Teacher Faith explains the concepts really well and took the effort to make herself available for additional help after class. Not to mention that my daughter really loved the classes and found them really fun and enjoyable. She ultimately got an AL1 for Math which exceeded even her own expectations!",

      "text": "I sent my son for the online science class for PSLE's preparation class with Teacher Jo. Her patience and dedication was shown through the way she explained the key concepts and explanations for different types of questions, and would also consistently remind them on the techniques to score marks. Overall, I found that her lessons were very helpful as my son had a big (2AL level) jump, which would not be possible without her teaching and guidance. We are thankful to have found Bluetree and Teacher Jo through our friend's recommendation.",
