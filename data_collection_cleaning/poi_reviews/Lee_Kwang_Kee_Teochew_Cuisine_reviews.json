The restaurant is not big so I tink itâ€™s better to make a rsvn before coming . The price of hotpot is not cheap .. double the price of fish head hotpot. But do give it a try! Also they hv 20percent discount if u join members so u guess itâ€™s more worth it!",

      "text": "Never ate such horrible fish steamboat before... not sure why this place is so crowded but the reviews are mostly accurate. Paid $65 for a pot of soup with so much veggies and pathetic slices of fish which were not even fresh. The soup was so fishy my dad ate 1 mouth and thats it......\n\nThe other cooked dishes were still fine. Oyster omelette had alot of oysters but not fresh. Prawn ball was fine. We also ordered their bazhang (not in pic) but it tasted horrible ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®\n\nNever ever coming back again and pls do not waste ur money here!!!!!",

We order the set menu, so we do not have the fish steamboat, which apparently every table order one. We will come back for the steamboat after CNY. The food on the whole is good, especially the steam fish and shark fin. Recommended.",

Although the restaurant isnâ€™t air-conditioned, the ceiling fan provides good ventilation, making it comfortable enough. I also couldnâ€™t resist trying their huge dumplings, worth the value.",

A jem in the neighbourhood and it open 24 hours!\nVery authentic teochew food.\nHighly recommended on their teochew platter, you can have all the teochew signature in one plate. The pig trotter jelly is also a bit different with other stalls, thicker and more texture, and very nice. The fish porridge is awesome too. You must try\nThe best part you can also enjoy Cantonese dim sum here.",
