Goh Shirlyn,4,"This bowl of Mee Hoon Kway was absolutely delightful! The handmade noodles had a soft, chewy texture that paired perfectly with the rich, flavorful broth. Every spoonful was packed with the minced meat, crispy anchovies, and egg. Overall, it was a satisfying and delicious. Perfect for a rainy day or when craving something hearty and homemade!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104514021300126863659/reviews
Yang,4,"Ah Huat Mee Hoon Kueh ($4.50) features handmade chewy noodles in a rich, savoury soup with marinated minced meat, choy sum, a poached egg, prawns, fried shallots, and ikan bilis. While the noodles and soup were the stars of the dish, the prawns felt unnecessary and could be skipped for a cheaper option ($3.30/$3.80). A hearty and satisfying meal overall!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews

TN Boey,4,"Great deal and food!

Handmade mee hoon kueh (broad wheat noodles) which are handmade fresh, right in front of your eyes!

They offer affordable eats for anybody, starting from 3$ for a medium bowl of noodles, with meat, an egg, and some vegetables, all the way to 5$ for 4 extra prawns.

Definitely a place you should drop by if you're in the area. The soup they put the noodles in is also light and flavourful without being overly salty.

Overall score 4/5",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105375668338316247264/reviews
Porshin Ng,4,"Always my go to comfort food since secondary school days! The noodles are springy and the broth is light but has the right amount of umami to it. Mee Hoon Kueh is hand pulled so if you appreciate the traditionally uneven texture, you will love it!

Please do not expect any service except cooking your dish. Sometimes you might even witness the couple argue. However, without fail, the dish will be cooked right!

The new coffee shop is much cleaner and it’s spacious and windy.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107429272416257729022/reviews
