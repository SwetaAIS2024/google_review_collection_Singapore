It serves a mix of Reserve coffees, classic beverages, and snacks. To avoid the crowd, visit during non-peak hours or explore other nearby Starbucks locations, like Marina Bay Link Mall.",

Always a place I would visit for a cup of quick coffee\n\nService is great for me. Never had any issues with them since I first patronized them. Very friendly. Welcoming and nice staff members.\n\nAtmosphere at Marina Bay Sands feels a little better than other Starbucks. Not that other outlets are bad. Just that this place feels better.\n\nWill be back again üåü",

      "text": "I had a disappointing experience at the Starbucks MBS that I‚Äôve always frequented. I‚Äôve always had good experiences with the service of regular staff such as Loges and Amin. Today the new staff Ajcai showed bad attitude and the service felt rushed and poor. He started closing procedures well before the official closing time of midnight. He was eager to chase customers out even at 11.40pm when the official closing time is 12am on a Friday night, which is not the welcoming atmosphere I expect from Starbucks. If the closing time is advertised as midnight, customers should be able to enjoy their time without feeling pressured to leave early. I was always allowed to stay till the closing time of 12 midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.  I hope the management addresses this issue to improve the customer experience and satisfaction. Otherwise I would definitely discourage my friends and relatives to patronise this store in future.",
