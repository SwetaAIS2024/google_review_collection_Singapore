xaxxolonch,5,"Super delicious, love the tamagoyaki super delicious. Highly recommend the sweet sour chicken, it was super flavourful and tender. The spam sushi roll was also super delicious, the rice was soft and fluffy. Love the pancake too, it was soft and a generous amount of fillings. The tobokki was also spicy enough and chewy . The zhajiang noodles was also superb, it was seasoned well with the black sauce.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112943480526851653374/reviews

Melvin Liew,5,"Best jajjangmyeon in JB! Have been to the restaurant when they were at Molek and I’m glad that the taste didn’t change despite the extra 40min drive! Ordered their jajjangmyeon with tangsuyuk and mandu and they were very delicious! Missed having it when I was in Korea and it definitely hit the spot satisfying my craving for a good jajangmyeon! The tangsuyuk is a must order and the kimchi sides was very good too. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a great jajangmyeon and tangsuyuk, along with a variety of other dishes from their menu!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100222656151411422680/reviews

Sean Sean,5,New clean and good Chinese Korean food. The sweet sour pork is very nice.  Set meal for 5 dishes at rm180 is also very worth.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106961859890315476383/reviews
