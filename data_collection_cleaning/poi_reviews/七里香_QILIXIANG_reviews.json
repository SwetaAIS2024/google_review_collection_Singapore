      "text": "I tried to submit my feedback on their app but couldn't. Main entrance space is tight and customers no choice have to all crowd there end up block mall users + quite scary if customers hands holding hot tea or coffee cos everyone is too close for comfort (while queuing to order, the customer in front kept accidentally bumping into me cos I was very close to him. But I had no choice cos I was blocking the entrance\n\nHope the shop can consider sticking QR code on tables for customers to order, to provide convenience, and reduce discomfort to other mall users\n\nSesame oil chicken was nice although a bit pricey compared to other \"nostalgic food\" eateries like Wang Cafe or Toastbox. Still,  I won't mind ordering again\n\nAlso I like the Korean spoon, very pleasing to use when eating hehe",

      "text": "Visited QILIXIANG for afternoon tea over two consecutive days! The Prawn Chee Cheong Fun, Chicken Nuggets, Sesame Oil Chicken Rice and Luncheon Meat & Egg Sandwich with Hot Kopi and Teh were savoury and flavorful! The standout item was the homestyle Sesame Oil Chicken Rice which QILIXIANG has aced the taste! Skilfully marinated and cooked, the whole chicken wings (cut up in two parts) were tender and juicy with aromatic sauce that was of the right consistency - both complemented each other flawlessly..unexpectedly yum-yumðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ Can't wait to try other stuff!\nQILIXIANG recently moved to a new location that is situated closer towards Royal Square @ Novena main entrance. It has a larger space for casual dining and a smaller area for sale of dry merchandise, like cookies, tarts etc.  Given the white interior and simple setting, the environment is bright, unpretentious and functional nonetheless. Yes, the service staff are friendly and efficient. Anyone craving for Ipoh-inspired cuisine and specialty coffee, be it munchies or full meal, it is worth giving QILIXIANG a go! Best to avoid rush hour or be prepared to wait.",
