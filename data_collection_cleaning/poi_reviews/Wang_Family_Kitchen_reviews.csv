LP Pua,4,"A friend brought me to this restaurant, and after being seated, I couldnâ€™t find any menus. My friend explained that there was usually no menu because everyone eats the same thing. However, today was differentâ€”the staff came over and asked whether I preferred Kimchi Soup or Pork. Later, I noticed that the menu and prices were displayed on a TV screen outside the restaurant. My pork set included rice, soup, pork, and eight side dishes. And dessert was also served after the meal. The taste was alright, but the uniqueness of the dining experience won me over.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
jean ho,5,"Yummy food! it really feels like family restaurant, there are limited options for each day, 2 options are available on the date i visited, chicken soup and fried pork, we like chicken soup more, seems fixed price total 39.8 for 2 sets. Recommended! They will give a dessert (small waffle and one fruit) for each set.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107686923275991695210/reviews
jaynechz,5,"Chanced upon this homely Korean family-run restaurant nestled in Hillview CC. They donâ€™t have a menu, so we opted for one each of the two bento sets they offered. Yummy home cooked Korean food. They even had a dessert at the end (warm mochi waffle and a slice of pineapple)! Would come back again :)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101621939474125187588/reviews
Jodeci Fine,5,"Happy New Year Everyone! ðŸ¥³ Our first meal of 2025. An authentic Korean Restaurant well hidden in Hillview CC. About 7 min walk from Hillview MRT. Good vibes and we are served by very friendly Korean boss. Service is top notch and they are known for their affordable prices.

Very interesting concept from this restaurant as there is no menu to show. They serve only one set meal per day and set dishes change everyday (follow their Facebook for update).

Can you believe it?? A set meal with 9 dishes(assorted banchan+stew chicken & korean fried chicken), one bowl of soup, one plate of dessert(watermelon+mochi waffle) and rice only at 18.90 each!! No service no GST!! The banchan is very delicious and chicken is very well-stewed so yummy sauce. Really an unexpected find!!

We will be back!!

Viveca V,1,"Been here several times in the past year, the food was fine (you could definitely get better food for cheaper) for the price, had always been served by a Korean lady - sheâ€™s great. But the experience by the male owner cum waiter this morning was atrocious, there needs to be a fairer queuing system in place! The man  (supposedly the owner) took note of us waiting in the queue (and he acknowledged when we first approached him to ask for a table before waiting in line) alongside other groups of patrons waiting outside the eatery for their table. When a table became available, he ended up inviting the other male and female duo (photo: the lady in revealing spaghetti strap padded top and sports shorts) in for their meal ahead of us right immediately upon their arrival, leaving us waiting in the queue. No apology made. And I  recall they do not take reservations, no? Horrible experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115456083877417584999/reviews
