C,4,"Chestnut Nature Park is Singapore‚Äôs largest nature park, spanning 81 hectares and offering a serene escape into nature. It‚Äôs a great option for a light hike, especially for beginners or casual walkers looking for an easy, refreshing trail.

The northern loop is a straightforward 1.7km route that takes just over 30 minutes, with gentle terrain and clear signage throughout. Along the way, you‚Äôll find a couple of huts for shelter, small bridges, and a quiet stream ‚Äî simple highlights that add charm to the walk. I‚Äôd rate it a 4 out of 5 ‚Äî accessible, peaceful, and a welcome retreat from the city.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
LiAnne Ole,4,"Another pleasant morning hike at Chestnut Nature Park via Zhenghua Nature Park, started from Hillview.

Greeted by a squirrel shortly after our hike at the very beginning (lovely)! Then, it started drizzling‚Ä¶fortunately, just a passing cloud. Well, on & off over the 2-hour hike. Overall, a pleasant hike despite the humidity.

Apparently, quite a few wild roosters/hens spotted along the hike on this trail. I kinda like this nature trails üëç üëç",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109023630295431446580/reviews
Donald Isaac,4,"Great for weekends with nothing to do and want to take a walk in the park.

This place consists of hiking and bike trails which are well divided but sometimes people just walk or ride anyhow.

There are plenty of monkeys around doing their own thing.

It‚Äôs not a bad layout and good for those that enjoy both hiking and riding.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111620843433357170307/reviews
Meng Fai Yip,5,"We were at Chestnut Nature Park on three occasions.

On the first occasion, we were at the inner section of the Northern Hiking Loop, and we noticed that this hiking trail was relatively more rugged compared to many other trails in Singapore. We decided to go to the Northern Loop because the Southern Loop was partially closed.

On the second occasion, we were at the Southern Hiking Loop to train to hike on rugged terrain using our recently purchased hiking sticks. We saw some weird-looking fungi along the way. The Southern Loop was still partially closed then.

On the third occasion, we were at the outer section of the Northern Hiking Loop to continue our training on rugged terrain, routing back to Chestnut Nature Park car park via Zhenghua Park. Highlights of this route included the Observation Tower and an old bridge in the vicinity of Zhenghua Park. We also spotted a small deer along the way. The small deer was probably a mouse deer.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238839349859158213/reviews
Eva B,4,"A pleasant place to walk for a few hours.
The northern loop was my favourite as one can hear traffic in the southern one. But the trees with the 'globe balls' in the southern one were very interesting!
Got to see a wild boar family in the northern one, safely in the distance.
I enjoyed the view from the tower, too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102558088981043953228/reviews
