The vegetables and boneless pork loin were tender and juicy.\nWe love steam salted turnip egg was marvellous.\nThe same goes with the curry fish head.\nOverall, we had a sumptuous dinner.\nThe service personnel was excellent. Ms Eileen and Mr Xiao Qiang are very polite and humble",

      "text": "Chance upon a video on tiktok that there are many variety of food served in this aircon coffeeshop. Was disappointed that only the seafood stall is opened. Since we are already here so ordered a few dishes to try. This stall didn't disappoint us. We had the claypot fish head, sweet & sour pork and the prawn paste fried chicken wings. The food is great, my favourite will be the claypot fishhead. Fish is fresh and in the pot there are tofu, random vegetables and pork cubes. Quantity of tofu and pork cubes could be more.\nBill for 3 dishes is $68.  Will be back to try out other dishes. Parking is conveniently outside the coffeeshop.",

There is an air-conditioned zone for bigger group dining. Use Fave eCard and enjoy some discounts. Highly recommended.",
