The intention is just get you to pay for the tuition fee and when want to withdraw, refuse to refund although during sign up had a different story. Avoid this like you avoid a person coughing during the height of the covid delta period.",

      "text": "Went there for an interview, easily the worst experience I have had. Place is located at an underground bomb shelter, lots of construction around. When I got there there was no one, I rang the doorbell but it didnt seem to work. Knocked but still no one. After about 10min someone finally came up. At this point I was already wary of the place. For the actual interview, the interviewer was extremely unprepared and did not know anything about me though I had submitted my resume prior to the interview. Interviewer was clearly not prepared and sat there keeping quiet majority of the time. I did most of the talking and clarifying the details of the job. All of a sudden the interviewer asked me to teach a lesson. I was not informed of this beforehand and was completely unprepared but regardless I went ahead with it spontaneously. Anyway to conclude the interview, the interviewer proposed a salary that was approximately $500 lower than the stated range. Honestly given all the red flags, the only reason why I was still interested was because I thought the salary range stated in the job portal was decent at $4.2-$5.2k. I was horrified when the interviewer offered $3k+ only so future teachers please beware. I personally would not recommend even attending the interview, dont waste your time.\nFor parents thinking about sending your kids there, syllabus taught is way above the level in school, about 3-5 grades above. If your child is advanced and already has background knowledge for higher levels then you can consider, if not dont, because your child will struggle a lot. Teachers at the centre are not MOE trained which is ok, but what I was surprised by is that they arent familiar with school syllabus at all, based on my experience, so do beware of that.\nAll in all I had an extremely unpleasant experience at the place and 100% will not recommend anyone to go there. If there was a 0 star option I would give that.",
