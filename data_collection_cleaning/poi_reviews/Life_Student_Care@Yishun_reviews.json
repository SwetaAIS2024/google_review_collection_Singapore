Besides academic monitoring, the teachers are also actively bring the kids to outdoor activities nearby centre. They also work with local high school and university so the kids can have more interaction with teenagers/youth as well as some enrichment program, outing to some local attractions, park, museum which my girl looking forward every week. My girl had been more independent, discipline.",

      "text": "What initially appealed to me about Life Student Care was its spacious layout compared to other student care facilities in shophouses or malls. I wanted my son to have a comfortable environment after a long day at school. However, it was the teachers who became the deciding factor. I found them to be sincere and friendly. If you don't believe me, just strike up a conversation with any one of them! After my son was enrolled, I realized that there were volunteers conducting lessons and organizing activities for the kids frequently, which I found to be amazing. I'm glad we made the right choice; the teachers exceeded our expectations. Thank you, teachers and volunteers! üôèüèª",

The patient and approachable teachers, along with the transparent reporting system, have made it a fantastic place for my child who is on autism spectrum. The principal's responsiveness is also noteworthy. I'm grateful that my child has such a wonderful place to attend after school.",
