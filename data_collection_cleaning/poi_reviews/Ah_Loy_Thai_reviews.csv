Lam Yuanyin,2,"I had dinner with my friends on 11 April. It wasn‚Äôt our first time there, as we remembered the food being good and the staff being friendly during our first visit.

However, our second visit was a terrible experience. The staff were rude, with sour expressions throughout. While we were eating, an elderly staff member suddenly wiped our table and pushed my friend‚Äôs glasses aside. That was still manageable.

Later, when we were about 70% done with our food and my friends were still eating, the same lady came over and attempted to clear our dishes. We were fine with her taking the empty plates, even though the sauce from one dish splashed on us slightly. But when she tried to take a half-eaten fried egg, we stopped her. She responded by rolling her eyes at us.

It‚Äôs worth noting that other tables were still empty, and we had only been there for about an hour‚Äînot as if we were lingering for more than 1.5 hours without eating.

What an experience at the restaurant. While the food is undeniably good, we might not return for a while.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103791757713091627070/reviews

H·∫£i Thanh,5,"It was great to try Spicy Seafood Glass Noodles (first pic). I am terrible at eating spicy but it is worth to try once. The others (chicken and squid) were fine, not too bad but also not too good.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117611275649594554861/reviews
Jimmy Boey,5,"We ordered Tom Yum Nam Sai (Clear Soup), Pandan Chicken and Glass Noodles Salad. They are very generous with the serving and very yummy. Aunty gave us extra chilli and was very attentive to our needs. The only negative part is the noise, it feels very echoey and affects the dining experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106422115320754938753/reviews
L x,3,"I like the clear tom yum soup, very good flavour, but the ingredients are not fresh.. frozen prawns and squid. The pandan chicken is not bad, big piece but can be abit tough. The omelette is crispy! The pineapple fried rice and phad thai are soso.. pineapple fried rice dont have floss and pineapple is not ripe enough. Phad thai lacks fragrance.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116678363375930567885/reviews
