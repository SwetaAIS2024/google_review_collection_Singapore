jayden,3,"Nice bowl of bak chor mee, I ordered the minced meat mushroom noodles with extra chilli and vinegar. The proportion of sauce and gravy blends in well with the noodles, not too dry or overly oily. The noodles doesnt have the ""yellow noodle"" flour doughly taste. The meatball is quite nice, I guess it's handmade by themselves. The meatball isn't those usual normal small meatballs, it's bigger and also more meaty kind of feel.
However 3 stars for the atmosphere and cleanliness, when I entered the restaurant I can smell a foul ""toilet"" smell, very stuffy and bad ventilation. To my great disappointment the outside seats is as bad! There is urine pee smell on the outside area and the floors outside below the tables are all covered with bird shit stains! The tables are also dirty with bird shit.....super unhygienic.
Food is good but with such environment and hygiene issues, I won't come back here.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
