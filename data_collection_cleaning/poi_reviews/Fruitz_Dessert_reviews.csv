John Koh,5,"Love to come here for the cut fruits and fresh juices. With all the spicy food in Bedok corner, nothing beats washing it down with a fresh sugarcane or fruit juice. The lady owner is friendly and always serve with a smile. I will enjoy a dessert like Chendol or ice jelly during the hot afternoon. Prices are pretty reasonable from $2.40 for watermelon 🍉 to$3.50 for avocado 🥑 gula melaka shake. 3 🌟 for Atmosphere because the heat is unbearable during the month of May!! Lastly, Stall is clean and spotless as I always see the boss cleaning up when there’s no order.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103447327229500686102/reviews
