Serene Huang,5,"Was recommended by a friend whose daughter was enrolled in Shaws almost 10years ago! Absolutely love that there’s plenty of outdoor time within the school compound and not forgetting the curated sports programme by the Shaws little league!

The teachers are patient and meticulous to details. They provide timely updates to what is happening in the classroom so the parents can be well informed. Overall, a great experience so far!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105418077637402969742/reviews
Reena Kaur,5,"Our son has attended Shaws since he was 18 months old starting in pre-nursery. He is now 5 and attending K1. What attracted us to Shaws was the focus on play-based learning. It was evident in our initial research and over the last few years that Shaws puts a big and very professional effort into developing and executing the curriculum. The teachers have given excellent pastoral care, and we have seen very impressive development in terms of our son’s learning abilities. This is in addition to a fun and engaging sports program including an on-site swimming pool.

Perhaps the best testament is that our son enjoys school and he looks forward to going every day. When we pick him up he’s always happy and sweaty from playing with his classmates. We feel that Shaws has just the right balance and approach to nurture children through these important developmental years. None of this would be possible if not for their very dedicated staff and caring teachers!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111628593337887399870/reviews
Deepa Govin,5,"My oldest joined Shaws Lorong Chuan in 2019 and has since graduated. He not only had the most fun with all the excursions and various school events, he was also very much prepared for primary school. My younger two attend Shaws currently and are having the same fun.   It’s incredible how the curriculum focuses on messy play and sensory stimulation for the younger ones and slowly build up to focus on reading, writing and math concepts in the K1/2 years. Though we are Indians, my kids thoroughly enjoy their mandarin classes packed with songs and dance. The teachers are fantastic.. Thank you Shaws for the amazing preschool experience!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116932856965719528016/reviews
Cel T,5,"My son started in Dec 23 and has been looking forward to go to school daily. This gives me great joy to know that he’s adjusting well to classes. He loves the positive energy from his teachers who have made a lot of effort to engage the kids. Since starting, we have had 2 parent-kid external excursions and the school also hosts different events which gives a holistic education and learning experience",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112139596751886029514/reviews
Kelly Williams,5,"Our journey with Shaws Lorong Chuan began in May 2023 when our 2.5-year-old daughter joined Pre-Nursery. Fast forward to today, and she's flourishing in Nursery 1. We couldn't be happier with our experience at Shaws.

One of the standout aspects of Shaws Lorong Chuan is its well-crafted curriculum that seamlessly blends learning and play. It's evident that the teachers and staff are deeply committed to nurturing young minds. Their unwavering support for both students and parents has been truly commendable.

Moreover, the facilities at Shaws Lorong Chuan are top-notch, providing a safe and stimulating environment for children to thrive in. The dedication of the principal and teachers in fostering our daughter's development has been remarkable. As a result, we've noticed a significant boost in her confidence and enthusiasm for learning and participating.

We are immensely grateful to the entire team at Shaws Lorong Chuan for creating such a nurturing and enriching environment for our daughter. Thank you for making her early learning journey fun, safe, and unforgettable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111856787266283751808/reviews
