Also pleased that it remains open for public access at any time (except when there is a session of course). Hope the area can be maintained well.\nRoller bladers/ skate scooters/ whoever rides plastic wheels have to be careful as some areas can be covered with moss and hence are slippery.",

During primary school time you will have a chance to be here acting as \"drivers\" \"riders\" \"pedestrians\" practicing Road Safety. You will be given a card, all you need to do is to go to the respective station, they have these mini petrol station/bus stops/ vicom etc etc with traffic lights and zebra crossing, to get a stamp without committing any traffic offences then you will passed off as a road safety users, cool rite?!?",
