Helmie Misni,1,The worst experience ever had. Ordered seafood fried rice and seafood fried noodle at 6pm waited and waited for half an hour but still didn't get my food. Was assured by the guy who works there it gonna take 2 more mins. So I took his words. The place was NOT crowded at that point of time only about 5 customers was eating. The worst part is the customer who ordered after me got his food first. In the end I told them to eat their food themselves and left that place.,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111953125983910056398/reviews
