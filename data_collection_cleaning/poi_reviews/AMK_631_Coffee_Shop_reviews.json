The sides were a mixed bag: the mashed potatoes were a bit too creamy for my taste, but the tater tots were crispy and enjoyable. Overall, a decent meal with room for improvement.\nRating: 3.5/5",

Fish soup, rojak, zi char, chicken rice, Muslim food, chai fan, etc. The toilets are clean and well maintained. The service staff here are mostly seniors but very courteous, friendly and smiley. Everyone seems happy to work here.",

The cheapest I've had in years and of very decent quality. $3.00 for curry chicken, vegetables and steamed egg with less rice. The bee hoon stall has a unique \"bee hoon\" choice that looks like Hokkien Mee. Price is not as cheap as the mixed rice stall but it is very reasonable and opens 24 hours.",
