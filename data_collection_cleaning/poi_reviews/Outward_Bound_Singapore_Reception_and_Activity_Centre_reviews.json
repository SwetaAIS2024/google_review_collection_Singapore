My kid was posted to the East Coast Campus this year under the charge of a tomboy instructor.\n\nI wouldn't advise those whose kids are having mid to serious asthma (ours was not in this range) to even consider going. Having a medical certificate and filling up the pre-camp form was as good as of no use.\n\nThe instructor did not allow any pit stop and not forgetting kids are carrying heavy weight backpack or survival pack while hiking. Informed on pre-existing condition.\n\nHowever, of compliment, is the joining school's boy student in the same team whom displayed excellent teamwork by assisting to encourage and helped \"weaker\" ones with their backpack, lending of suntan lotion (although had one), etc. Kind soul displayed at a young age!",

      "text": "I was really looking forward to my experience at Outward Bound Singapore (Pulau Ubin Camp 1), but unfortunately, it didnâ€™t live up to my expectations. The facilities felt outdated, and some areas could definitely use better maintenance. Additionally, the scheduling was poorly managed â€” there were long periods of downtime where we just sat around with no clear direction from the staff. While I understand it's an outdoor experience, I believe more organization would have made it much more enjoyable.\n\nThe staff, while generally friendly, seemed unprepared for unexpected situations, and there were moments where safety protocols didnâ€™t seem to be adequately enforced, which left me feeling uneasy.\n\nOverall, I hope OBS can work on improving these areas to ensure that future participants have a better experience. I would have appreciated clearer communication and a more structured program.",
