Misaki,1,"The short blonde hair lady (probably an auntie), (she was guiding the queue in the front) at 1:44pm today was super rude and wanted me to give up my queue when i literally did not press any cash and i help my mom to queue since my card is getting declined for no reason. There were literally ppl who queue together with her colleagues press out cash at the atm? I had to literal shout at her because she was being so rude and didnâ€™t ask us nicely. She just butt into my mom and start to shout at us bruh",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102231048801249828870/reviews
Luqman HS,1,"Terrible management of a branch.

Supposed to open at 10 but there is no queue system to manage the people waiting. No queue ticket machine or q sms to manage the line. Senior citizens were just standing around waiting for the branch staff to show up.

Please buck up",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101781655388984496203/reviews
LoliconMaster69,1,"Replace people with a single machine. Needed to replace my card asap but for some reason not only must you go to a video teller machine, its the only machine there and it does not work.. If you need help with something or need to get your card replaced don't even bother wasting your time here, also it swallowed my previous card so another reason not to come here for any other reason than to withdraw or deposit money",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115395487606922700315/reviews
