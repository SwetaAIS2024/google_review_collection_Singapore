But, for those who do not fancy fresh, tasty juicy crispy chicken parts, do not fret! Plentiful of food selections to fill your stomachs, and also enjoy a hot bowl of soft soya bean curd just on the left of the main entrance staircase. Have some fruits and snacks as you head out to go about your dailies. And, should you somehow dropped and crack your phone along the way, there is a very reputable phone repair shop!\n\nCome get your peace of mind and heart at this very cosy mall, have your stomachs filled and happiness with your loved ones here!",
