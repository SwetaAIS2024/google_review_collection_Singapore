To me, personally I think the patty doesnt suit the bun at all, steak is harder to chew. I bite both burger and steak together but after 1 min, im still chewing the steak and the bun is already devoured... I would prefer their patty beef instead of steak next time.\nFries was pretty normal, price also dont seems to match the burger.\n\nI will be back for other dish and re-rate this cafe. Sorryz.\n\nI ordered only 1 main dish and thats all, will change the rating once i tried another dish.\nService: service was great.
