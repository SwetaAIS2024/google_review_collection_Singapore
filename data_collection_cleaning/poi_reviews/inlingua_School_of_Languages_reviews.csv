Minh Phúc Nguyễn,5,"It has been a great 6 months of study Chinese Intensive Class. Teachers, staffs, even the Director are very kind with study, they always want feedback from study day by day to make sure that their students will study in comfortable and fresh environment which is very important to study at an "" international environment"".
If any students want to come to study Chinese I would recommend Inlingua.
The staffs 9.9/10 ( Friendly, helpful, positive and energy)
The teachers 9.9/10 ( Above but much more care about your study and attendance because they wish you not to KNOW but to UNDERSTAND) *Important*",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104878811372910835326/reviews
TASY,5,"I have been studying here for the last five months, and I have to say it has been the best experience I’ve had with any language school. After studying here, my Chinese has definitely improved. Not only have I learned the language itself, but I have also gained cultural insights — whether in class from the teachers or through activities organised by the school.
The staff were very friendly and welcoming, ensuring clear communication between students and the school. The teachers were thoughtful and caring, delivering lessons with dedication. They didn’t just go through the material but genuinely helped students understand it.
The learning environment and facilities are definitely a plus. The school provides everything students need and creates a very comfortable atmosphere.
Overall, I’m really happy that I chose Inlingua to study Chinese, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a language school in Singapore — not just for Chinese, but for any language!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115796780438358243045/reviews
林慧瑜,5,"This is a very good school where everyone is easy to get along with, and you can meet friends from different countries. The classes are interactive and lively, so they are never boring. I am very glad to have met such wonderful teachers and classmates. Over the past 7 weeks, my English conversation skills have improved significantly. If I have the chance, I will definitely come back! Thank you, inlingua, for the wonderful memories.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112106890197379848225/reviews
enzo 9374,4,"A really good school with amazing pedagogy. The teachers and staff are attentive and do their best to respond to any request. The courses are great and emphasize oral speaking, which is excellent for learning English for beginners and intermediate levels. It's perfect for learning how to speak English informally and communicate your thoughts, but a bit less if you’re looking to perfect it in a formal and professional way.

Overall, a positive experience !",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102081815741480848784/reviews
