joey lau,2,"I have patronize Old Chang Kee at WWP since it first opened. Service crew is forever friendly. However I am truly disappointed with the food quality this morning when I grab my popiah‚Ä¶.

Don‚Äôt be mistaken. The service crew is still friendly as always.. and I grab my favorite popiah like I usually do‚Ä¶ when I took a bite I got a shock‚Ä¶ the popiah skin was HARD n crispy and has that super oily taste and felt like it was refried!  I have always buy popiah from old Chang kee cos it‚Äôs always made fresh‚Ä¶

This morning‚Äôs experience made me wonder if these are the leftovers from yesterday..
I still finished the popiah and the oily taste lingers in my mouth‚Ä¶ this is the most yucky popiah I ever tasted.

I hope the management will seriously look at the standard of food and upkeep the reputation and food quality n taste like you have always do‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs such a disappointing experience‚Ä¶
I should check the popiah colour next time before I get.. :(",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103622968756308118721/reviews
Shirley Tung,5,"Cheezy Kaya‚ÄôO, this innovative snack combines the brand‚Äôs signature flaky, buttery puff pastry with a unique filling of creamy Mozzarella Cheese and fragrant Kaya. The result is a perfect balance of sweet and savory flavours. While you might expect a cheesy gooeyness, the kaya takes center stage with a rich, luscious filling that‚Äôs reminiscent of salted egg yolk sauce, offering a satisfying and indulgent bite.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106317919913718716517/reviews

Belinda See,2,"Saw the ""limited time promo"" for big fish ball with fiery chilli sauce so I ordered it. Aunty gave me the usual chilli sauce and said the promo is only for sotong wing. So is it false advertising? Or is aunty not aware of the new promo?  Either way plz do something about this, outright misleading",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101391540947062041769/reviews
