Chloe Snyder,5,"I absolutely adore this place and we will go out of our way to go here rather than closer spots. The people are kind and friendly, service moves fast but they never appear rushed (professionals!), and the coffee is SO GOOD. Vegans and dairy / egg allergy folks rejoice - the cookies they make to attend the drinks are made without egg and dairy. (Both types of cookies they make are delicious). I recommend their latte, rose coffee, and soy hojicha latte (iced!).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107080157930478365870/reviews
Pearlyn Yap,5,"I was googling for places with good coffee in the Havelock/Clarke Quay area and came across this humble, beautiful and cosy space, run by a lovely young couple. I read the reviews online but honestly did not expect the coffee to taste that good (my expectations are pretty high), but I'm really pleased that I was able to get good cappuccino at such an affordable price in this area! Their cookies were lovely too!

The young couple running this space was incredibly friendly, and chatting with them for that short 5-10 mins while I was waiting for my coffee made my day, because of how passionate and authentic they were in running this humble space. :)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100146700165843425688/reviews
Yee Yee,4,We took our lunch at Havelock2 and passby this coffee shop. There's a monitor recommending hojicha latte. üòÑSo we give it a try. They give a free cookie with purchase of any drink. The Hojicha taste bitterness and burnt smoky flavor. Taste acceptable. The shop only has few stools and we had to take away and they do not provide straws.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104000004718761246100/reviews
Joanna Wong,5,"Nice cafe serving good coffee and yummy pastries - located in the basement of Havelock II. You get a cookie with a drink purchase. There are also some seats if you want to take a breather from your office desk!

They accept digital payments - Fave & ShopeePay (can get a slight rebate - yay). Glad to know they also have dairy milk replacement - oat milk is available! Will definitely be back for more cakes and coffee!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114388960892399045138/reviews
Adeline Goh,5,"Have always love their cafe latte and cold brew tea since I have tried at their old stall at Hong Lim.

Don't have pics of the hot cafe latte because drink finish liao üòÅ

The eggless chocolate chip cookie is nice. Bought a packet for my kids. And seeing how yummy looking the brownie chip is, also got one home. Banana pecan cake looks good, will try soon.

Just wish such nice coffee is located near my home.....

And ya bought a cold brew black coffee home before they can paste their shop logo label in it :)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114684469877176081566/reviews
