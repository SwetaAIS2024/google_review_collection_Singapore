Haziq Samsudin,1,"I had food from this restaurant which branched to Temasek Polytechnicâ€™s canteen. However, the food hygiene really is poor. The server that cooked my prata didnâ€™t wash his hands before putting his hands to fold the dough and crack the egg. Afterwards, he washed his hands and wiped it onto his jeans ðŸ˜ƒ. Really poor food hygiene, and the next few days Iâ€™ve been struggling with the need to use the toilet every few minutes.

Please look into this issue and review their hygiene certificate. Itâ€™s really questionable",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117083549575708932750/reviews
