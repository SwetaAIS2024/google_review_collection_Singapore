      "text": "Watched the historic match between Lion City Sailors and Hiroshima Sanfrecce here. The seats were close to the action which made for a great viewing experience.\n\nHowever, it seems like the stadium/staff weren’t prepared for the large crowd (4000+ people). The toilets ran out of water so we couldn’t wash our hands, and the water coolers also ran out of water during halftime. Plus they did not allow people to bring water bottles in, forcing us to leave the water bottles on a table outside, but the table was not large enough to accommodate all bottles, by the end of the event the bottles were all placed on the floor instead. This led to a very long queue for drinks, which we managed to get prematch, but abandoned our halftime queue for second cups due to the super long wait. I get it that LCS isn’t used to attracting such large crowds, but they need to up their game for the upcoming semifinals, which is bound to attract an even larger crowd. The toilets need to have water, and there needs to be more drink vendors (otherwise, simply let people bring their own water if you can’t sell them water). Looking forward a better semifinals experience!",
