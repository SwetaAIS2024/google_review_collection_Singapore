thwelay2015 thwelay2015,1,"I had a very disappointing experience at this clinic with Dr. Chelsea. I went in with severe mouth pain and bleeding gums. Dr. Chelsea dismissed it as just ‚Äúsmall ulcers‚Äù and didn‚Äôt provide any medication or proper advice. A week later, the pain got worse, so I went to another clinic turns out it was actually a cold sore, and they immediately prescribed the correct treatment. Because of the delay in diagnosis, I had to suffer through an extra week of unnecessary pain and my healing took much longer. I really expected more professionalism and proper care. Would not recommend based on my experience.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101315251384991766527/reviews
