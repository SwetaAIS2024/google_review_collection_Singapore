Weixi Tan,1,"Ridiculous system for this day and age. No one was managing the queue on 5 May. Walk ins and people with pre-bookings are made to wait in same line. Really? It not only waste the time for walk-in customers who might not know the rules, but also those of us who made the effort to do a pre-booking. Swensons, you can do much better than this!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107139034445652718527/reviews
G Z,4,"Was craving for a tenderloin and this place didn't disappoint. My mum ordered a pan-seared barramundi, which was thick and fresh. Got the salad bar with my tenderloin and was surprised that in addition to salad, there was a selection of sliced bread  (multi grain, sourdough), fruit, prawn crackers, cheese and soup.

Finished off with the quintessential banana split and a single scoop of durian ice cream. Swensens ice creams are the best! Service however was rather slow, staff didn't seem knowledgeable, so that detracted a bit from the experience.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115201872598341368949/reviews

Jane Lim,5,"Came for a dept lunch. We had the set lunch. The salad bar had a good spread of food, with soups. The service staff was very friendly and efficient despite serving a big group of us - 70 persons. The lunch was good.
