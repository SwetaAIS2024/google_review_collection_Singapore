      "text": "A huge shoutout to Heart of God Church!\n\nWe had 14 pastors and leaders from New Life Restoration Church join the GenerationS Pastor Conference.\n\nWhat an incredible experience it was! Under the leadership of Pastor How and Pastor Lia, God is raising up so many amazing young people who are making a real difference in this generation. This conference was a powerful wake-up call for all of us to value and empower the next generation!\n\nOver these three days, their team went all out to make us overseas guests feel welcomed. Hanging out with them was so easy and warmâ€”it honestly felt like being with family or close friends. They donâ€™t just call their church a home; they made us feel like it was ours too!\n\nAnd of course, a HUGE thank you to HOGC Pastors & Team 18 Global Hosts:\n\nPastor Garrett Lee\nPastor Charleston\nJian Ming\nCindy\nWee Shing\nChiu Wen\nJay\nTimothy\nNicole\nShearer\nEdward\nHui Ting\nFion\n\n* If I messed up any spellings or left out anyoneâ€™s name, my bad! Feel free to let me know and set the record straight.",

You donâ€™t see fireworks or dance performances all the time (in fact, maybe only twice or thrice a year), feels more like a club than a church, loud music and many young people dancing during their worship.\n\nIn fact, when you first walk into this church, you might think that it looks like a 5-star hotel, with â€˜butler servicesâ€™ (they are actually volunteers who serve as hosts!).\n\nLights, screens, cameras, cross-stage.\n\nLook beyond all those that I mentioned. Stay around to hang, talk to the people. Youâ€™ll be amazed to find that itâ€™s not about â€˜Christians are all friendlyâ€™, but heart of God people are genuine.\n\nMy 4 y/o learns to serve people, be compassionate and look out for the needs of others and clean up after her own mess. Where else can I get such â€˜teachingsâ€™ for my daughter?\n\nYou gotta come and experience for yourself.",

Stay away.\nTry visiting one of your smaller neighbourhood churches, or expository churches instead :) Expository wise, I recommend Grace Baptist Church, Adam Road Presbyterian Church, and Redemption Hill Church. These churches (and many others) preach from the Bible in context and not from the preacher's agenda",
