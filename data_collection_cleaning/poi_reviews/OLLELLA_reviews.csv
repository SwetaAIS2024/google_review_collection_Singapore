C C,1,"I bought chicken rendang and kueh kosui from here as a friend of mine says they sell good food.
Chicken rendang sauce too sweet, chilli also sweet and the sauce soak the bowl, which causes the bowl to disintegrate. The kueh kosui is too watery, not firm nor chewy.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103508424259257680514/reviews
Dianne G,5,Love their kueh and glad to note there's space to dine in here. Their ayam lempir especially is my favourite! Staff are friendly and the sambal petai prawn was good.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101239466346974818146/reviews
Faith,5,"I chanced upon this quant cafe during my hospice visit. It was a rough few days and I got up pretty early around 8am. It made my day and helped me stay energized throughout the day. The store had not prepared the components for the nasi lemak but they kindly got it ready when I enquired about it despite saying they would only be ready in 30 minutes etc...

By far one of the best nasi lemak I had!! Fragrant rice and super moist and tasty chicken. Loved the sides as well.
10/10 would recommend!! I even tried to search for them on Grab so that they could deliver to my place, however sadly could not find them on grab ðŸ¥² guess Iâ€™ve to make my visit down. Please open on grab!!!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102212746000945138821/reviews

Jean Chai,5,"Nice little cafe tucked away in a corner of Mount Alvernia Hospital. They have a few seats there for dining in. Food options include Nasi lemak (this month) or protein bowls (that was last month), and with other items like lontong, and gado gado. They also have coffee and tea. And of course an array of their kueh and cakes (I really like their lempur ayam ). Good for a quick meal or takeaway. The food is yummy, a welcome addition to the Mount Alvernia campus. They close at 3:30pm though so",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115391654025827815074/reviews
