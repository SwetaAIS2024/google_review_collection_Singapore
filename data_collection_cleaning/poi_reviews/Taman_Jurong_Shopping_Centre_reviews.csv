Yi Ling,4,"An unassuming crowded neighbourhood shopping centre here.

It's a good in between of old and new. Ventilation is pretty good and very interesting because of shops. There are 2 food courts here and traditional bubble tea shops and snack shops as well. Car park is in the basement with beautiful plants basking in the natural sun. Kids running in the designated playground.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115707001285123682601/reviews
Ayi KW,4,"The shopping centre is left with some kiosks still on business. The building was old and incomparable to those new shopping mall. But still a place to go for food, grocery and market for nearby housing. Bus access is convenient to and from MRT station. And there is a mosque just a side.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104367576393154426307/reviews
Andrew Ho (‰ΩïÂæ∑Ë¥¢),3,"A sleepy old neigbourhood shopping centre at the older part of Jurong. Not much people walking around but it's bustling in the morning due to the close proximity to the market and food centre next door.
There are 2 food courts, a supermarket and a variety of shops offering different service and products for all needs and wants.
The only shop with the best business is the 4D LOTTERY. Who doesn't wanna get rich??! üòÖ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117281057664754523775/reviews
