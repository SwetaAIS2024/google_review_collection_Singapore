The staff attitude is very rude, shouting at foreigners like us. And when I entered, I didn't know that inside this bar smoking of electronic cigarettes is prohibited, there was no sign or any reminder when I entered, the security guard outside checked my bag and knew I had it and didn't see any reminder, when I entered, I used it once and the staff snatched it from my hand. I think they just kept it to prevent me from smoking inside again. And after a while, I left and asked again if I could have it back, the staff said they threw it away. They could have reminded me the first time without throwing away the customer's things (Other 5 star restaurants also don't throw away the customer's things like that, they just remind). When going around, the staff chased away and shouted at the customer. The first experience at the bar was terrible. If it was just confiscating and throwing away the e-cigarette, I wouldn't say anything because that's bar policy, but I have to rate the attitude and service of the bar, discriminating against customers who bought tickets.
