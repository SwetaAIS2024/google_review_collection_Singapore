      "text": "This fabulous wtm stall well hidden in this industrial park food centre certainly changed our knowledge of wanton mee. Helmed by a couple, they have great variety of menu at affordable $4 each and the interesting part is you can get to choose your type of mee. Very interesting.\n\nCuriosity with a foodie mind. An idea just hit us. We decided to order Mee Pok instead of usual Mee Kia. Mee Pok Sesame chicken chop $4 in wanton mee style. Heard that mee pok is their specialty and we are glad that we made a smart choice. Sesame chicken chop is actually a char siew chop topped with sesame. Ohhh.. surprisingly delicious!\n\nThe mee pok they use is not our usual type instead It's thinner version and has a very smooth texture. Very yummy with no alkaline taste at all. Lots of black sauce/chili given, mix it up and the best thing is they are not salty. Very satisfying fusion from this hidden gem stall. We enjoyed it very much and will surely come back for more.\n\nüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã",

      "text": "Chance upon this wanton noodle stall right inside one of the coffeeshop at Ang Mo Kio industrial area. This wanton noodle stall was the only stall inside the coffeeshop with a short queue, there was at least 5 people infront of me when I was there.\n\nApart from the standard wanton noodle, they have a few other options to choose from such as chicken cutlet noodle, braised soft bone noodle, as well as Sarawak kolo mee. The wanton noodle starts from SGD$3 onwards. The bowl of noodle came with both fried and normal wantons, decent charsiew and blanched veg. Noodle was nicely cooked and texture of the noodle was springy. Personally like the sauce alot, it was very well balanced.\n\nOverall, an above average wanton noodle for me, only cons for me was the location.",
