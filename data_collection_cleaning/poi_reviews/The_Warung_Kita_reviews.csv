Denis,5,"Lovely space for lunch üòÑüòã

We tried Ayam Rendang, beef and kuey teow for lunch!

Syrup Drinks are ABIT sweet for me but the service and food comes pretty fast.

5 of us we visited about 12noon and food came in about 8 mins after we ordered",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107269275231105198912/reviews
Sally Lee,5,"It was our first time here, and we were impressed by the beautiful view and the comfortable outdoor seating. The service was excellent as well.

We visited for lunch and ordered the Kambing rendang, Ayam Rendang, and Korean Cheese Noodles. We enjoyed all the dishes, though the lamb was a bit tough. However, the flavors were delicious!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106215866297684705142/reviews
Intan Syafira Rostam,2,"We decided to visit this restaurant after seeing their paid collaboration with a KOL on TikTok. The place itself is undeniably pretty‚Äîcozy interior, aesthetic setup‚Äîso we were a little surprised to see how quiet it was when we walked in.

We ordered a Spaghetti Carbonara for me, and my husband went for the Fried Chicken Chop with Truffle Fries. For drinks, we had Orange Juice and Apple Asam Boi. It took around 15‚Äì20 minutes just for the drinks to arrive, even though the restaurant wasn‚Äôt busy.

When the drinks came, my husband‚Äôs orange juice tasted like watered-down Tropicana Twister‚Äîlike it had been diluted two or three times. Not ideal.

The food came out in parts. My Carbonara arrived first. It was okay‚Äînothing special, just decent comfort food. But my husband had to wait another 20‚Äì30 minutes for his meal, which unfortunately came burnt. The lighting inside was dim, but even the camera picked up how charred the food looked. The truffle fries were overly oily and lacked the flavor we‚Äôve come to expect from similar dishes elsewhere.

Our bill came to RM77 for two. For the tastewise, wait time, and overall experience, we left feeling disappointed. Unfortunately, we won‚Äôt be returning.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106383280795331501799/reviews
Paddlegood,5,"We love this place, we always bring our guests here- buffet or ala carte. The food never disappoint, be it western or local. Dishes were prepared with care with beautiful plating. Surprisingly, even a simple dish like carbonara exceeds our expectations. Shiny, creamy, al dente well seasoned pasta. One of the best place to have assam pedas too. Service people are excellent, attentive to our needs. Beautiful aesthetic insta-worthy decor, nice music, kid-friendly, ample carpark, clean. Menu does not have overwhelming variety but they keep updating their menu which is refreshing! Drinks here are good too! Would love to gatekeep, but here‚Äôs the review.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106974524144368081671/reviews
fearrow,4,"Brought my family to The Warung Kita for breakfast, and it turned out to be a great start to the day! They offer a breakfast buffet at RM24, but it‚Äôs not your typical self-service style. Instead, you order your dishes, and they‚Äôre freshly prepared and served to your table‚Äîa nice touch that keeps the experience more personal.

The food? Simply delicious, especially the sambal, which really stood out. Every bite was packed with flavor, and I couldn‚Äôt resist ordering more after every dish. Let‚Äôs just say my wife wasn‚Äôt too amused by my endless stream of orders‚Äîshe gave me that look. Hahaha!

The in-laws were happy, which is always a win. They enjoyed the food and the overall atmosphere. It‚Äôs safe to say this place has earned a spot on our ‚Äúmust revisit‚Äù list.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114871863174076338408/reviews
