Jeremy Chan,1,"Now moved across to Mr Teh Terik eating house.

Overpriced- and more ridiculous- rigid policy on 4pcs ANY two flavors!
So 3 peanut and 1 coconut should be alright?
NO!
The lady taking our order says ONLY 2 peanut and 2 coconut!

COME ON! What’s the difference!?????? Don’t be so rigid and inflexible.
We actually wanted 2 gula, 1 peanut and 1 coconut - not even allowed. Tsk tsk tsk!  Bad marketing and selling strategy.

And it’s $5.. 4 pcs
And it’s so small.!

And the new peanut flavor, again a mislabel - it’s actually peanut butter - NOT NICE.
Better if it’s dry crushed peanuts and sugar.

And the gula Melaka, so much less gula inside now - look at the pics- it’s NOT enjoyable anymore.

Won’t be coming back.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107031205335562689738/reviews
Chun Keong Chia,2,"Alamak… why you deprive me of the fresh coconut shavings?

You have pampered me with fresh and heart warming putu piring all these years, and I thought today would be the same. But I got a rude shock and horror.. when I finally can feast on my post meal dessert after a terrible day at work.

Seriously being an ardent fan and supporter of you, I really cannot accept this. It’s just not the same dish without it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112592835033732855595/reviews
Darryl C,5,"Was around the area and tried this for the very first time. Took away 3 boxes of Gula Melaka filling for $10.50 and asked for the coconut shavings to put at the side as I wasn’t intending to consume immediately.

The Putu Piring was made fresh on the spot - Exterior was fluffy and topped with nicely grated coconut shavings along with the right amount of sweetness from the Gula Melaka in each piece, it was a delight in every bite.

I’m Chinese and Putu Piring is like a relative to our Tutu but I think I prefer Putu Piring!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116339559063664007715/reviews
陈亮永,4,"Haig Road Putu Piring offers a traditional Malay snack, featuring soft steamed rice cakes filled with fragrant Gula Melaka and topped with grated coconut. Handmade with care, each bite delivers a perfect balance of sweetness and heritage. A must-try local delight!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114321948141200229097/reviews
Justin Tan,3,"This is a simple Malay rice cake with palm sugar and coconut shavings. It makes a light dessert. I used to have these as a teenager,  but it's no longer a must-have food whenever I am in Singapore.  It's definitely worth a try for tourists. The price for 4 pieces is $2.50 in January 2025.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115739474329491912284/reviews
