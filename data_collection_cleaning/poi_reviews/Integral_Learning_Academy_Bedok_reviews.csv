James Phua,5,Ms Yew is extremely patient and understanding in helping us learn new concepts and topics. She always aims to cover the topics before school does so that we have a better understanding before learning it in school. The small class size also makes it more conducive for learning.

R K (thedarkestmellow),5,"I enrolled in this tuition center in 2023 for O-Level Additional Math lessons and I was definitely impressed with the quality of the lessons. My tutor, Mr Clarence, was very helpful and gave detailed explanations to all of the problems. The learning materials are more challenging than those provided in school, which is great as it helps with preparation and really comprehending all the concepts and skills. Because of this tuition class I scored A1 for both my WA2 and prelims. I finished my A Math O lvl exam with confidence thanks to the help and support of my tutor. Highly recommended to anyone looking to get better A math grades and simultaneously develop genuine interest in the subject.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100338897502116581429/reviews
