DR DAVY GOH,5,"Located at the top floor of the industrial building. Cosy place to have dinner, quiet environment.
Great seafood at affordable price. The steamboat was an excellent dish to order. The soup was flavourful and lots of ingredients- more than enough 3-4 person. The steamed fish was fresh and well-cooked.
Overall, their food were quite good.
The place could still be considered clean.
Staffs were friendly and nice.
This stall also sells canned abalone at reasonable price.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100178836333366849641/reviews
Kendrick Wee,5,"Quality of food was mostly above expectations and its prices were all very very reasonable. Small setup, but the place had a lot of choices. Hidden in a quiet place. Parking was easy in SkyTech building. - Stir fried beef hor fun (wok hei, marinated meat, right balance on the flavor) - Claypot noodle (fair amount of ingredient, generous portion) - 三捞河粉 (generous with fish and if saltier would be better - Sweet sour fish (generous portion, not overly sweet nor sour)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793547912532718349/reviews
MNG,5,"Located on the 9th floor of an industrial building which provided a great view of the surroundings.
It is a canteen for the local workers during the weekdays.
