There are table needed to be clean and empty seats available but waitress have no more bandwidth to bring customers in. waited for a good 15 mins and finally got in. Place is noisy, lots of echo. Need to raise voice to heard each other. The atmosphere and service wasn’t really pleasing. Roasted chicken was oos at 7 plus, didn’t managed to try and gotten the white chicken. It was good, the sauce is nice. Rice is fragrant and tasty. Traditional dumpling, a good mix of mushroom, prawn and pork. The beansprout was served piping hot and tasty delicious. Not a fan of their chili and ginger sauce but it was okay cause the food already taste good.",

      "text": "Best roasted chicken rice in Singapore hands down. Had their chicken rice for many years and the main branch is the best, their roasted chicken has crispy skin with flavourful meat. I had their roasted chicken at their now defunct Marina Square outlet and it wasn’t very good. I usually eat at their restaurant to ensure the chicken is at its tastiest. You can skip their tze char dishes and stick to just chicken rice because most of them are underwhelming. I have eaten their baby sotong, Thai style beancurd, dough fritters and sambal kangkong and all of them were below average.",

Chicken served cold, as it should. Veges served piping hot and were comparatively expensive. I asked for less oily, but still seemed oily, and was slightly over salted. But have to have a balanced meal right?!",
