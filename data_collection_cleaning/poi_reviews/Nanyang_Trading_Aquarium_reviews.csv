mehmet eren,5,"I really like this shop as you can find everything you are looking for under one roof. Prices are better than other aquatic shops in town most of the time as well. Just a friendly reminder for not to expect much assistance from the staff, it is mostly self service so you need know what you are looking for.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117711579927767075153/reviews
Goh Sheralyn,1,"Just bought a bag of Zebra snails from this shop today & only to realise ALL 5 ARE DEAD!!
We thought they were resting but all of them did not move an inch even after 5hrs!
We took out & smell them & GOSH THEY STINK LIKE DEAD BODIES!!

Just like other reviews say, they customer service at the cashier not even friendly so whoever want to buy snails from them, do it at your own risk!!!

I put 1 star because its mandatory to choose, if possible I will rate a NEGATIVE!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116453867332153340686/reviews
Manjit Singh,1,"I recently visited Nanyang Aquarium and was impressed by their wide variety of aquarium items. However, my experience was marred by poor customer service. When I tried to provide feedback on a defective item, the cashiers were unprofessional and unhelpful. Unfortunately, my attempts to contact the manager/owner, Mr. Winston, via email and phone calls were met with silence.

Turtle tanks are leaking water even though the brand new unit in their shop is leaking and yet they continue to sell it to customers even after being aware of it.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117230088640392515068/reviews
Hakuna Matata,1,Just bought a bag of Apple snail about 1 hour ago and only to find all of them were dead. 3 of them are even empty. Called the customer service and they didn't even ask for photos or do any investigation and straight away reply no exchange or return. What a good service!,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100716461232359880860/reviews
Albert Yeo,1,"bought $50 worth of fishes here. less than 30mins later, more than 10 fishes were dead. called them up and the person on the line said, they were alive when you paid but we canâ€™t guarantee they will be when you leave the shop!!!!

Will not recommend for livestock.
Decent range and variety of supplies but be prepared for 10-20% higher prices.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110321406679784448178/reviews
