Timothy TM,4,"The cali burrito is awesome, super tasty! Mini size ($8.90) is too small and the regular size is quite pricy at $12.90 but itâ€™s quite a meal. Quesadilla was super tasty but the regular portion ($8.90) is again too small to be a meal. The coffee is good quality and is cheap at $2 for latte, but it is proportionally smaller :)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116897826354325250403/reviews
