Gabriel,5,"Review is based on off peak dining at 9pm-ish. 1st time here, this outlet is clean and neatly designed with fine aesthetics. Ordered 2 cakes, partner enjoyed the pistachio cake alot. Checker cake was the runner up. Dark Chocolate peppermint is unique and novel. The cold brew white Coconut was a miss for us. There was not much patrons to begin with so service was rather efficient and quick hence nothing much to fault as service crew were also polite and friendly. Perhaps the only comment was that we were a group of 2 but only 1 tissue was given 🤔, it's the attention to details that do matters in the long run.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117387838809977391267/reviews
ChunWei-CW Li,5,"Lady M at Orchard Central offers elegant mille crêpes in a chic, minimalist setting with great Orchard Road views. The Signature and Earl Grey flavors are top-notch, though pricey at ~$13 per slice. Service can be hit-or-miss, especially during peak hours. A great spot for a treat, but there are more affordable alternatives if you're just after good cake.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110528148229170189484/reviews
Jenn,4,"The service is worth the wait. I cant even comprehend how the server can still smile, greet, and be very friendly despite the busy service and the stairs that she needs to walk on to serve the food and drinks; up and down. Big kudos to Madam Jackie (unsure of the spelling)!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101973946691840334852/reviews
WenKang “wenkang” Chin,5,"Cakes are fantastic. Textures and favours are well balanced and top notch.
The overall tables and sitting setup is great with good privacy.

Definitely not cheap.

A little bit of minus point for the service, sent us a wrong cake and coffee came late.
A male staff taking the order from the nice variety of cakes options seemed a little impatient.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115756761244278882368/reviews
