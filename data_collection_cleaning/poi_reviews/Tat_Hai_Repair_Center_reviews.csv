Samantha Ko,5,"I had a great experience with Mr. Aung from Tat Hai. He arrived right on time for the appointment. Within 20 minutes, he had my washing machine fixed efficiently and professionally.

The service was not only fast but also very reasonably priced. What stood out most was his patienceâ€”he took the time to answer all my questions, shared useful knowledge, and guided me through everything I needed to know.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a reliable, skilled, and friendly handyman. Thank you, Tat Hai and Mr. Aung!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109797345995252016089/reviews
David Chee,5,A friend recommended this company. My washing machine was leaking due to a torn gasket. The company didn't have to gasket at hand so I bought an OEM gasket from Shoppee and paid for installation. Benny was the repairman and came on time. The installation process was very complicated but he was very fast. The best thing about his service is he gave me advice on how to maintain the machine and what to do of machine breaks down again.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103141603760662465251/reviews

D C,5,"Recommend! Chance upon Tat Hai Repair after searching many on a Sunday wee hours due to wash machine failure to drain. Many 4.0 rating above were closed or unresponsive nor provide repair job. Called 85557676, an avid female customer rep was quick to attend and make arrangement. Handyman, Mr Benny was experience & skilled. He identify the issue & repaired on the spot after discussion & careful consideration due to other hidden obstruction. He was patient and kind to further advice. Takes pride and effort in his field. For the labour and appliance $150. Transport $40 waived.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105370849723143879140/reviews
