      "text": "The entire experience at Lien Clinic for Women was excellent, professional and exceeded our expectations. The staff are a credit to the clinic, I would recommend to anyone!\n\nDr Lien and the clinic staff handled our situation with great care and understanding. Dr Lien is a brilliant doctor and extremely knowledgable, we felt as though we were in competent hands from the moment we arrived. Due to the nature of our visit being a shock we were feeling a tad fragile, we were treated with the utmost empathy. We had many questions that were answered in a patient manor and clearly explained to us, at no point did we feel rushed or pressured into making decisions.\n\nAfter we had decided that we would proceed with the plan set out by Dr Lien it was put into action swiftly the same day. I was booked into day surgery where I was escorted to the hospital and checked in by staff from the clinic. The surgery was a great success and I am extremely happy with the quality of the attentive care I received.\n\nDr Lien met with me post surgery to discuss how it went and came back for a further check up the following morning.\n\nAfter being discharged from the hospital I was brought back to Dr Liens clinic for a debrief  where I was prescribed my medication and had a check up appointment arranged for the following week.\n\nMy follow up appointment went extremely well, my pain was practically at a zero and I felt myself getting back to normal! Dr Lien examined me and removed my stitches, he was very reassuring that everything had gone well and my recovery was progressing as it should.\n\nDr Lien and his staff are all genuine and sincere people, they really do care! They will make you feel as though you are their only patient!",

      "text": "Dr lacked empathy and asked some unnecessary questions but overall professional. Staff was very money-minded and just worried about bills being paid, not understanding and rude. My friend was trying to find the funds and I offered to pay first since I live close by but the manager said the patient needed to be present during payment for the medication to be given, then the manager proceeded to say in a condescending tone that there was “no rush anyways” and she needed “cool down time” and she can come the following week albeit the fact that my friend was in distress and wanted to get this procedure done as soon as possible.",

      "text": "We went to Dr. Lien for second opinion and were grateful that we found him. He is very professional, meticulous and patience in explaining the medical conditions. His genuine caring and kind heart throughout the process makes him standout among all the specialists that we've ever been to in private hospitals in Singapore. His dedicated nurse team is also very friendly and helpful. Hence,  we highly recommend him if you're looking for a gynecologist/obstetrician.",

      "text": "Dr Lien delivered me and my siblings, I went to him based on my mom's recommendation. He took care of me until my 24th week as he no longer do the delivery. He is very experienced, and each time he will do an ultrasound for me to check the fetus. He gives very sound advice and he is open to us asking questions and finding out more. He is a very patient and caring doctor.\n\nThe staff at his clinic are also very friendly and welcoming, helping with the ultrasound and whatever that I might need. Kudos to them :')",
