      "text": "Tastewise pretty good. But very overpriced and service was okayish. That's the reason I'm giving a 4 and not 5.\nVery spacious , have good seating both inside and outside. But You have to go to the counter to order everything. No one comes to check in on anything.\n$28 is too high for a breakfast platter when you have that kind of service.\nOatmilk latte was good. Asked it to be heated up more and they obliged.\nPlatter - Salad was good, scrambled eggs were yummy.\nSo no issue on quality of food. I'd come here more often if it was slightly better priced. Also almost no veg options but can't really complain on that..",

Would recommend to try the TSP white coffee as the saltiness of the cream goes really well with the coffee. The har cheong gai waffles is   also a must try!\nThe cafe offers tissue and water which I appreciate as not all cafes provide that now.\nOverall, I highly recommend this cafe as the ambience, service and food are exceptional ü§©",
