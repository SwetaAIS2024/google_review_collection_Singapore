Quite a number of food I like to eat.\nMy favorite is the Cai Peng during lunch time. Then the laksa shop has delicious laksa, always sold out by 4pm. The Indian stall is very underrated but it’s one of the best ever. Tze Char nice and reasonable price. Morning I like to have their egg, bread, Kopi set only 3.50.",

New western food stall has rather good value food and sells quesadillas which is quite rare.\nBeing a vegetarian, the zichar stall, western food stall (vegetarian quesadillas) and Indian food can satisfy my needs.",

      "text": "Update mar22\nNew stalls are carrot cake cubes and chilli king wanton noodle. Not sure if the zichar stall is closed for good, not seen them operating for past 2 weeks\n\nUpdate dec 2021\nThere goes the dessert stall and come a western stall cheekylads.\n\nUpdate aug 2021\nChilli king wanton noodle is located here. Not too bad for their wanton noodle\n\nUpdated jun2021\nChicken rice nicely fragrance. Chicken meat is ok but not for the char siew. Char siew abit in the hard to chew. Stall owner is friendly though\n\nNext to the chicken rice stall is selling dessert like chendol and tua suan. Not too bad but the way this stall.is set up, dont seem like the seller is planning to be here long but just trying out if this place is suitable for his dessert\n\nThe fried hokkien mee stall no longer in operation but in place is a mokata and lok lok stall..seem pretty popular, can see many eating at the coffeeshop\n\nOlder post\nFried hokkien mee is good. The indian stall serves good prata too. Recently the coffeeshop went thru some renovation for better shelter and more seating area.\n\nCoffee and tea here is nice here and thick, not the usual sugar water tea you find in most coffee shops.\n\nThe seafood hor fun stall is new and quite popular. Tried the yee mee, those who like lot of port lard will love it.",

      "text": "Small coffee shop, peaceful quiet and cozy.\n\nNew stall selling western called Cheekylads has good size portions! I’ve tried their cream pasta, grilled chicken and fish & chips.\n\nI personally like the pasta and grilled chicken. The chicken is grilled till the outsides are crispy and still moist on the inside. The pasta portions are big, good for big eaters.\n\nThe grilled chicken with cheese is also enjoyable - they’re very generous with the cheese portions. Good for those who love cheese!\n\nTheir coleslaw is also fresh (I’m very particular about coleslaws, I seldom eat it actually) but I could savour a few mouths from this stall.",
