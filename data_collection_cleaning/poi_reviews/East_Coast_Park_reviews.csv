Loh Ricky,5,"Best beach you can find in Singapore, plenty of parking lots, restaurant and cafe, pet friendly too.
The park was beautiful and there were many tables and bench for resting.
You can rent bicycles here to cycle along the coaster.
The road was built wide enough for an enjoyable ride, you will feel safe as they are separated from the walking pavement.
Along the way you can find restaurant,  cafe, children playground and toilets for your needs.
There are areas for camping and bbq, and it is definitely a good place for family gatherings.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105538701864779732018/reviews
Lonnie Bevens II,5,"I frequently visit East Coast park as it is on one of my exercise walking routes. The hawker center has something for every taste, the walk paths and surrounding areas are well maintained and groomed. There is an automated water ski lake with three levels of difficulty for every skilled level. Very beautiful and serene place to spend time.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102461799908688670960/reviews
Gabriel Kang,5,"We had an amazing day at the Swan Valley Cuddly Animal Farm with our two kids! From the moment we arrived, the staff were super friendly and welcoming. The kids loved feeding and cuddling the baby animals—especially the lambs, bunnies, and guinea pigs. There were also goats, ponies, alpacas, and chickens roaming around, which made the experience even more interactive.

The tractor/train ride was a big hit, and the playground kept them entertained for ages. There’s plenty of shaded seating and picnic areas, so it was easy to relax while the kids explored. It’s such a wholesome, hands-on place for young children to learn and have fun. Highly recommended for families visiting Swan Valley!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110659862523504713900/reviews
Tiew traven,5,Nice beach for a walk or a run. Visited there on a weekday morning and it was so peaceful. Got to see many amazing sights and nice scenery.

Elvina Ang,5,"Decided to go a morning walk here and it was the best decision! A bit far from the city but worth it!

Many people come by to go fishing, biking, walking, running, or just enjoy the slow morning just like me.. Better to bring water along with you!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102931720560954796172/reviews
