Ray Lim,2,"Visited Capasso about three weeks ago for a dinner date with my girlfriend. The restaurant is located in the CBD area, so the price point was
definitely not an issue for us ‚Äî we‚Äôve had our fair share of dining experiences.

The food was decent, the atmosphere was spot on ‚Äî cozy, classy, and perfect for a night out. Unfortunately, the service left a lot to be desired. Throughout the evening, we couldn‚Äôt shake off the feeling of being judged by the service crew. We received looks that made us feel like we didn‚Äôt belong there ‚Äî as if we couldn‚Äôt afford the place or were ‚Äútoo young‚Äù to be dining in such an establishment. Not to mention, we were served breadsticks in a ceramic jar instead of what others were served - on a plate?

At this price point, good service should be a given, and sadly, that was where the experience completely fell short.

Would I return? Probably not ‚Äî great atmosphere and vibes with decent food, but the poor attitude from the staff was enough to ruin the night.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102197777291359408245/reviews

Barry 95,4,"Good atmosphere. Had the highly raved about pork and crab meat pasta and other dishes too. However, these two dishes were just mid.

Overall, carbonara and butter served are the stand out.

Don‚Äôt recommend to spend your stomach space on the pork.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104087282975058175641/reviews
Kean // keanmono IG & TT,5,"I came for the pasta, stayed for the vibes, and left already planning my next visit!

With a cosy lounge for drinks, a DJ spinning cool beats, and even a cigar lounge, this place will have you saying *Mamma mia!*

We kicked off with house bread and smoked butter‚Äîsimple, yet irresistible.

Then, came the house-smoked Salmon Carpaccio, silky and smoky, followed by Burrata with Parma Ham ‚Äî a creamy, truffle-kissed dream.

Next was the Squid Ink Tonnarelli with Lobster ‚Äî briny, umami-packed goodness. And the Grilled Octopus Leg was sooo tender, I‚Äôm definitely ordering it again!

For meat lovers, you have to order their Beef Tenderloin, Braised Beef Cheek Tagliatelle, and Iberico Pork which were succulent and super satisfying!

And the Duck Confit Dumplings were tiny pasta parcels of pure comfort.

And you have to try their Deconstructed Blackforest Cake with rum jelly, simply delectable.

This is your sign to visit Capasso ‚Äî where every plate is a masterpiece and every bite, a love letter to your taste buds.

Highly recommend this restaurant for the wonderful dining experience, vibrant flavours and warm hospitality.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110201119911939984946/reviews
