Bryan Tay,4,"Tried some of the food here for the first time. Place was cosy, but the ventilation was quite bad at the dinning area.

Mee Hoon Kueh - 4.5/5 (Well executed dish, got to try this)

Curry chicken set - 4/5 (Nice and decent taste, but the presentation was off)

Nasi lemak set - 3/5 (Wrong choice of rice used. Sides dishes look very normal)

Grilled Squid - 4/5 (Have the char taste which I like, but why so watery cos it supposed to be ""Grilled"")",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106836086325330248925/reviews
Jes Low,5,"These are some of the best pastas Iâ€™ve ever had in Singapore! Itâ€™s not typical pasta from any western restaurant, the taste is just different. You have to try it to know!

The fish and chips are nice! They donâ€™t use tasteless dolly fish, and you can really taste the difference. The pizza is delicious too! Everything is a must-try!

MEY (Mochima),5,"Came here on a weekday night and it was kinda crowded.

Menu was extensive and make me wanna try everything! ðŸ¤£

With Norah's recommendation, we decided on Smoked Salmon Avocado Tartare with Tortillia Chips, Wagyu Beef Balls with Sourdough and Crabmeat Aglio Olio.

All dishes are good and our favourite got to be the Smoked Salmon Avocado Tartare and Wagyu Beef Ball, these 2 are your MUST ORDER!

Crabmeat pasta are for the spicy lover, love the fried garlic they use as garnish for the pasta.

We are already looking forward to our next meal here!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108391933445095625891/reviews

Love the salmon avocado tortilla, mid wings and curry chicken.

Would love to see idol Wang YuQing.

Hope to see him the next time.

Highly recommended.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103174467925260896781/reviews
Charles Lim,5,"Delicious home made food, we tried the wagyu burger, avocado salmon tartar, crab spaghetti, wings, and the signature Xiao fei yu mee Hoon Kueh. Excellent service, had a nice chat with the owner. A few of their specialty is cooked from scratch so expect longer waiting time. If you are there for the first time you will be briefed. My mum, wife and sis enjoyed the evening.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110889262262086182424/reviews
