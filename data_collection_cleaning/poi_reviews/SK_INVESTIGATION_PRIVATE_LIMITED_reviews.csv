Karabel Bramow,5,"5 stars for fast, honest and reliable work! I am so happy I went to Lawrence and team. They really did a fantastic job on helping me locate my birth father in Singapore while trying to communicate with them from overseas.

I explained my situation and within the same day (within hours) they were able to locate my birth father and provide me his address, photos, and video. Wow! I am so impressed! :)

Highly recommend this company, SK Investigation Services; and their rates are pretty reasonable compared to other PI. Please check them out first before consulting other places because their work is very professional and trustworthy. You will get good results!

Thank you so much Lawrence and team! You have made my dream come true and now that Iâ€™ve reunited with my birth father I am finally at peace with myself!

Yours truly,
Happy and satisfied customer",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110735750345453577575/reviews
Email Signature,5,"Fast, responsive, accurate and affordable.  I've used this company on several investigative projects over the last year and, it's been a pleasant experience each and every time. They get me information that other investigators were unable to get. Raffi is very approachable and patient. He often goes the extra mile to get that extra piece of information.
They have helped me find long lost family members that I have been needing to reconnect with. I can honestly say that the service they provide is very valuable and worth every dime. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone in need.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113096924808280484737/reviews
shah ahammed zubayer,5,I needed some assistance with some information. A regular background check was pulling up what I needed. I sent a message to SK INVESTIGATION SERVICES and he quoted me a price and we started working. At first he couldn't find what I needed but I knew it was more out there. The more information I provided the more they searched. Things started happening and the information started flowing. I love the extra mile they went to help me get the information I knew was there. These people are great and will get you what you need. But...be careful what you look for because you just might find it.,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100913938937898017929/reviews
Md Mridul Hasan Tusar,5,"I needed to investigate a private matter on a rush notice.I called them on a Friday and by Monday morning I had all the information I needed and more. The report was very detailed, informative  and definitely more than I expected. The price was very reasonable and actually lower than 2 other quotes obtained.

Very highly recommended if you need something investigated fast. No nonsense, Quick and to the point, you can't go wrong with this agency.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105485670739729493341/reviews
Jerome K. Williams,5,"I contacted him about finding a person that owed me money, within minutes of when I sent him a message with my situation, he responded back to me swiftly.  He told me he would look into my case and get back to me within a few days, he got back to me the next day with results that I was looking for and all the information I needed.

Definitely using his service again",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101919607796112116075/reviews
