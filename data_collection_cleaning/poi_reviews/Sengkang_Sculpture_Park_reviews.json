      "text": "Perfect place for families to gather and enjoy a morning...or really anytime. The palms and other trees are lush and beautiful.  Plenty of sun or shade plus benches to relax. Near some food/beverage spots. In between housing blocks. Easily reached by bus or MRT.  The sculptures are all wonderfully innocuous, from a whale or fish shape to bocce ball looking blobs to rounded fused cubes and so forth. Nothing that would scare a 3 year old or look spooky in the shadows of an evening stroll. Playground areas here and there. Walkways on varied ground surfaces.  Good neighborhood vibe.",
