Wilda,1,"Terrible management, teachers and principal. Only one awesome teacher there who is sincere and passionate about caring children especially those who require additional guidance in their developmental needs. Bad partnership with parents, lack of communication with parents to understand the child’s needs in depth and no concrete or follow up procedures taken for the betterment and inclusiveness of this kinda developmental needs child. No emphaty at all and when they left with no solutions; can’t handle the developmental needs child; they just watsap us to withdraw. Truly shows how unprofessional they are and easy to give up. Bad attitude of educators. Not fit at all to be teachers and having a centre. So parents who are searching for a pre school do look out for other reputable nicer environment pre schools that meet your child’s developmental holistically.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108551696925181222970/reviews
