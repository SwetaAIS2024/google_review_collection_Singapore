Gillian Koh,5,"Posting this review only after full grooming and 2 shower sessions at Pet Stop. Our groomer, Fiona did a wonderful job with my bichonpoo‚Äôs cut. She looked so good that it was worthwhile for me to drive the distance. My puppy was also happy to enter the shop. On top of the excellent craftsmanship, the shop space is kept clean and organized. Fiona might come across like she‚Äôs keeping answers short and sweet initially, but I think the animals know when they are cared for.

We will definitely continue with Fiona for her good work!

k9 kops,5,"Thanks for helping to groom a lost and found dog at short notice. Your excellent grooming skills transformed Brownie from a shaggy dog to a cute pup instantly. For a dog who has never gone for full grooming before in his life, and also a dog which has bitten a few people who tried to help him, you treated him with compassion and care, and we could tell he was happier after the session. Thanks for alerting us to his ears and butt issue so that we could bring him to the vet timely. Brownie thanks Fiona and team and gives Pet Stop full marks 5 stars!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106706337124209461944/reviews
