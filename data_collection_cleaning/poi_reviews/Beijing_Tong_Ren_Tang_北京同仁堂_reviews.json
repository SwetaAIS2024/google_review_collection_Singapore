      "text": "I highly recommend Therapist Goh TP as a therapist for anyone dealing with pain and discomfort. I’ve been working with him to manage pain from sprains and chronic neck tightness, and he has been an absolute lifesaver. Therapist Goh's approach is both professional and compassionate, taking the time to understand my specific needs and crafting a personalized plan to help alleviate my discomfort.\n\nHis expertise and skill in addressing muscle tension and joint pain have made a noticeable difference in my recovery. Not only does he use effective techniques, but he also takes the time to explain what he's doing and why, which helps me feel more confident in the process.",

I experience it once for my plantar faciitis (heel pain) which western doctors  just recommended physio that didn’t help after 1 year. Here, after 5 sessions the pain vanished. Second experience was pain in my left palm at base of thumb, hand ortho doctor prescribed a brace for 3 months without moving my thumb and it did nothing - Here, after just 1 tuina session it healed. Dr. Li Bin is the expert in tuina, you should give him a try.",
