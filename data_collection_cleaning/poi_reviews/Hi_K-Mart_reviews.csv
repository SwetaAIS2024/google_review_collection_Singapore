Caya Chan,1,"Wanted to drop off Shopee parcel, got confirmation end up mia, shop close and parcel still outside shop. Closing hrs at 10 I went at 9.45pm closed. Opening hours at 12pm, it’s 2pm now, non public holiday, not weekend. Owner still not awake :)

Edited: got replied close on Monday, but on Monday I called before going down, the owner said ok put outside he will scan by TODAY, I still double confirmed today? He said yes. If u guys are closed on Monday, jolly well edit the spx opening hrs. And I called the next day on a TUESDAY at 12pm according to the ss attached. So now tell me ur opening hr isn’t at 12pm on Tuesday too?",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103190569772558622172/reviews

Patty,5,"Friendly boss who is very kind to help receive shopee parcel on my behalf as I was travelling. The shop can then deliver to doorstep if a purchase is made (no min amt) from their shop, as long as resident unit is not far. As a small shop, I fully understand they may be out making delivery and there is only one staff on duty. Shop has variety of korean products which is great!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105350394742435295943/reviews
david tao,1,"Giving this 1 star for their collection point / drop off service. On various occasions, we had to go down multiple times a day just to drop / collect a parcel because the staff is always out during their operation hours. Parcels dropped off often take days to a week to be collected. On the platforms, most notifications is written as merchant unavailable which is not surprising as delivery partners probably came down to a locked store.

I have seen many customers waiting outside the empty store like myself recent weeks. The mart has had more than enough time to rectify this issue. It’s irresponsible for them to take customers’ patience for granted and continue using manpower shortage as an excuse.

If you’re rushing to drop something off, avoid this place!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114822658589450861429/reviews
