      "text": "I happened to arrive in this coffee shop (Kopitiam) by chance.\n\nFirst thing to look out for was to find a palatable dish to satisfy my hunger.\n\nYes...Hokkien Mee.\nIf you see in the picture an empty plate, you probably might ask why was it empty? Well, it is obvious that it is worth a recommendation.\n\nThe noodles are well cooked and the ingredients are generous. Given the price of $4.50 per plate, it is both an acceptable price range and it is delicious.\nAnd again, the reason for the empty plate photo. Sorry about that folks.\nWas sceptical at first and didn't bother to take a photo. After that, everything went in the stomach. ðŸ˜‚\n\nCome and try.\n\nDid I mentioned that they provide pork lard? Yes, self service before this place gets popular. LoL.",

      "text": "This Fried Hokkien Mee is the \"clean\" version. Lightly seasoned with almost no wok hei. But I surprisingly like it, if you are really craving for a plate of hokkien mee, I think this will just about hit the spot. Two things that stood out was the spicy and slightly belacan-y chili and the al dente thick beehoon. Not bad.",
