LP Pua,3,"This is a one-man operation stall that sells various Indian dishes. When I ordered the Maggie Mee Goreng, the chef had to juggle between frying the Maggie Mee Goreng and flipping prata for other orders. The taste was average and nothing remarkable.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Jit Sandhu,3,"A good prata place. Not too oily and a good texture, although could have been a little more crispy. The cheese and egg prataâ€™s are a decent size and the fish curry was flavourful with a little spice.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107828362774544806287/reviews
Sanae Ishii,5,"From 7 am,  you can enjoy a home made Prata, Thosai, and others only for SGD 2-3 dollars.  My recommendations are:  Onion Prata and Thosai.   After sending my daughter to school,  morning break with their curry and Prata/Thosai is relaxing.  Crowded in the morning and lunch so better to expect to be in a queue.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115143721962558907348/reviews
LeongYan Yoong,4,Friendly service for an early morning Masala Thosai breakfast in the Dover area! In the coffee shop setting with prata also as the other option. It was well made and good size serving especially the 3 sauces as seen in the picture. Worth a visit if you are in the area and want Indian breakfast.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104961167743187290991/reviews
R F,5,"One of the best Indian Muslim places in Dover / Ghim Moh / Clementi despite the small crowd.

Dhal / curry - excellent flavour with large lentil bits in dhal. Curries are all delicious and not too sweet. More liquid than northern Indian styles which is perfect for roti and thosai.

Roti prata - consistently good.

Thosai - slightly crispy",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117734560689339030931/reviews
