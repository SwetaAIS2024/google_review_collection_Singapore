      "text": "This could well be our new favourite place to hang out - a cosy and spacious bistro with fun activities and yummy, affordable food.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the grilled fish with fries as it was different than what is usually served elsewhere. With every purchase of a main, you get free flow iced lemon tea for just $3, and can have a go at the darts machines (starting from $2) too. The other table games are free to play, and they have billards, table soccer and old school video games.\n\nStaff was friendly too - we look forward to be back again!",

I suggest slowing down .... this building is just next to the Hafary Showroom building.\nUpon entering, you will be surprised by the interior decor the owner had put into.\nA big dining area, another section with dart game machines and high chairs.\nThe ordering station is at the center, where their friendly staff will explain and take your orders.\nWe ordered their Grilled Boneless Chicken which was succulant and nicely presented with fries and salad.\nTheir smoked duck salad came in a big bowl, with generous meat servings.\nOrdered a jug of beer to round up the meal.\nThere is a Special Offer now where every 2 orders, you get to choose the 3rd item at only $1.00 .... get more details from their friendly staffs ...\nYou can park at the building's multi-storey car park, take the lift to ground floor, go thru the main door, walk towards side of building.\nA nice place to chill with friends .. family ..",

We like the atmosphere and the kids were thrilled with the dart board and mini billard table.   To top this experience up, there was a free refill for the thirst quenching ice lemon tea . The chicken wing was well marinated as I did not need any sauce.  This is our third visit in a short span of 1 month.",
