Timothy Leong,4,"This is our family’s preferred children’s clinic. Their operating hours are slightly longer than others, which allows us to bring our child to see the doctor during non-peak hours.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101017930728410692319/reviews

Chu Alice,1,"Completed Infanrix Hexa (6-in-1) on 4 Jan 2025 with Dr. Jeffrey Lai, but the record in the National Immunisation Registry was updated as Hepatitis B missed.

Called the clinic on 7 Jan 2025 to check and was advised to wait 10 working days. Checked again on 4 Feb 2025, but the record still showed as no record found, so I decided to submit the record myself.

I am truly disappointed with the service, especially given that such important information was not properly updated.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108774904551678716383/reviews

Michael Tan,5,"I normally don’t post reviews for GP appointments but do feel that this one was warranted. Two days ago, I contracted a stomach bug and was in so much pain that I was quite surprised I didn’t faint on the way to the clinic and let alone in the waiting room.

When I got there, the clinic was rather small and looked like it was run by only a 2-person team. The seating area was a tad cramped and uncomfortable but when you’re sick everything feels (or is conspiring to be) uncomfortable.

The receptionist was very gentle and patient with me which I’m grateful for. I felt that she was genuinely concerned that I was in so much pain.

Though the wait felt long, when I finally saw the attending physician, Dr John-Paul, he got straight to the point and did a thorough examination and diagnosed me accurately and was comprehensive with his prescription.

Long story short: everything worked well and I made full recovery in just 3 days! I’ve had stomach bugs in the past and I’ve never had such a short recovery time such as this.

Just want to say thank you to the team :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100442835610338547032/reviews
