Jocelyn Chee,5,"The roasted pork is one of the best I've had! Crispy skin layer yet not hard. The rice is fragrant, the soup is hot and peppery and the chicken is tender. Everything is good! I love it. I would eat it everyday but need to control my calories intake. For house party I will recommend ordering the pork! Price is very affordable too! Uncle and auntie both very nice people!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106516626257682537216/reviews
zach quek,1,"Respectfully, one of the worst chicken rice i've ever had in my life. Ordered the more expensive chicken, asking for thigh and drumstick - there was little meat, and whatever meat was given was full of bones, meat was stuck to bone, and tasted dry and old. Even the rice was stale, and cucumbers were bitter. Never ever ordering here again. Please be warned to not eat here if you enjoy nice chicken rice.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100442879768854292919/reviews
임브렌다,5,"There quite a number of good food in Teban. One of my favourite will be Poh Poh Chicken Rice. The store sells Roasted and white chicken, roasted duck and etc.

My favourite will be the white steamed chicken. Taste really good and chicken is tender.

The auntie, I guess who is the store owner was friendly and cheerful. Usually give a good portion of chicken. The soup I think is not too bad, just that might have msg lol.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101007232829113133394/reviews
