Gosh. This will be my last time ordering from your bakery. 2 or 3 years back, the nutty misu cake was decent hence the 2 stars.",

The cake fridge looks old with the condensation inside so not sure whether it would affect the cake and also heard someone saying why is there a fly inside the fridge so it may have flew in.",
