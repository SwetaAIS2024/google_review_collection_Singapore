Vincent Teo,3,Thank Goodness that a new principal took over the helms. The other one...Boo was a real disaster. No leadership qualities. Lacking in compassion. Would have run the school to the ground.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102960050998686953144/reviews

Terence Leong,4,"Nice clean pool, though the walk up the hill can break you if you're not prepared for it.  Commonly used by many dive shops to train newbie scuba divers.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106938553533876498595/reviews
Flo Yeow,4,"Surprisingly huge secondary school located in the middle of town! They have a swimming pool up on the slopes, where the diving association PADI has a space meant for weekend pool sessions, as part of the certification process. It's not fantastically convenient, with busses and grab cars readily available, but is a short distance away from the train station. Not the cleanest pool around but gets the job done for sure.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
