I'm very impress with the way they tidy their shop.\nIts very neat, tidy and clean and the fishes are very energetic and in healthy condition. Am very happy with their service and both the boss and lady boss are very friendly and willing to share their knowledge with us. Had bought a betta and food from them too.. together to pair up with my lucky draw fish. They have quite a few of beautiful variety that they did not post on social media. The shop is not so big to house many people but the feel and ambient there is very relaxing. Will patronize them again soon...",
