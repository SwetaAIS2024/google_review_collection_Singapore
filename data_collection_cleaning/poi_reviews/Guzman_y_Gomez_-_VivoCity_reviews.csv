Lyon .L,4,Food was great as always portions here were rather generous as well. No complaints there only complaint would be the quesadilla which had quite a sad amount of chicken inside. Other then that the loaded fries were good and the burrito bowl as always. Would recommend,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116530427276878715771/reviews

Janardhan Shenoy,1,"I was at the VivoCity centre today and ordered takeaway of one cheese quesadillas and one spicy grilled quesadillas along with 2 Churros.
It took a while to get the order, eventually we got it and took the parcel away and when we reached home we saw the package had only one cheese quesadillas and one churros. The  spicy chrcken quesadilla was not packed and so was the churro missing
We live in the East Coast and now do not have the food for dinner. Tried calling non stop but it kept going on voice mail. Poor service",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106629497997784286021/reviews
Denis,5,"Visited on a Tuesday night 8:45pm.

Food came in less than 5mins.

Menu was easy to read and understand. I ordered Quesadillas Plus ($11) - pulled pork option, mild spicy.

The vibe of this space is spacious and nice for dine in and getting work done too üëç

I love the generous portions of ingredients and how flavourful each bite brings! Super cheesy too! I had 3 cheese pulls with each Quesadilla!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107269275231105198912/reviews
