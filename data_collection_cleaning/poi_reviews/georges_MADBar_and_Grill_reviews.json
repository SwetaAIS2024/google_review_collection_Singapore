A well stacked burger! ðŸ˜‹\nBrioche buns were a bit too crispy and it was falling apart with each bite so it ended up a bit messy. But no less yummy.",

      "text": "2025 Apr update : boy the Georgesâ€™ cop the lot burger was really good. The difference is the fries which were 10/10; crisper & still soft on the inside, tasty too even without the sauces. Highly recommend to try at least once. We ordered ours without cheese. They can add a fried egg on request at a minor cost.\n\nAlso 10/10 was the fried squid head. Awesome & addictive. Not for those with weak teeth though generally soft and the batter is nice & crisp.\n\n2024 Jan update : Georges burger awesome bacon burger & crispy fries; mine without cheese â€¦ mayo & ketchup ðŸ˜‹ New pictures uploaded.\n\n2022/May/06 update. The Banger & Mash recipe has changed since my last review. It is good. A repeat for sure. Topped with thin young asparagus, mushroom & halves cherry tomatoes at bottom with mash potatoes. Sausage is not the cheesy ones. Sliced into two pieces. See picture.\n\n2020/Jul/18 Saturday evening.\n\nOrdered the combo with pork chop & cheese sausage.\n\nService 5/5\nFood 4.8/5\nDrink 5/5\nAmbience 5/5\n- cosy but still spaced out for social distancing",
