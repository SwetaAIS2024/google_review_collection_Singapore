Lee JI,4,"Food was nice although quite expensive for its quality. The pizza was quite thin and hard, not recommended. Mac and cheese was nice. Beef burger was good and big.

KTV selection was quite ample with QR code song selection option. Rooms aren't very soundproof as I could hear someone singing from afar.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113582053690694725740/reviews
