      "text": "This morning I went and requested for a tall macchiato. While the menu said caramel macchiato, I specifically told the barista that I wanted it without caramel as I didn’t like it sweeten. When I took the coffee, it felt so heavy and opened up and it’s full to the brim! Went and asked the barista is this macchiato and he with a straight face said “yes, it is like that”. I may not be a coffee connoisseur but this is so wrong. It shows that the barista doesn’t even have basic knowledge, “great training” Starbucks! Wasted $7!",
