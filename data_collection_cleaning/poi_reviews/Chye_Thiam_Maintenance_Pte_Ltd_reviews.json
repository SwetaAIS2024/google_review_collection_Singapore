I stop my helper to see what they would do, staff then show attitude that she not happy with this. She didnâ€™t know the simple way to clean up spillage and want to use broom and dust pan to clear. I stopped her and helped her to clean then I place caution signed for temporary while  waiting for staffs to mop the floor. However no one could bother it until the floor get dry. This is terrible experience.",

They turn up about once a fortnight, and usually only when a resident complains. They say they do not have the manpower to fulfil the conditions stated by NEA. So why are we wasting public money for non-existent services?",
