Calin Chua,5,"We initially chose MFS for its convenient location without knowing what to expect.

Over the past 2 years+ (PG, N1, and now N2), we are incredibly thankful that our choice is right, because we saw the dedication and effort of the teachers in nurturing our boy.

While I wish there is more regular updates on the app (as provided by more premium schools), we understand that the teachers' focus is on the children (and we certainly didn't pay for premium school services). That said, the teachers are always very happy to share with us on what's going on whenever we ask.

Most importantly, my boy really likes and respects his teachers, and is thriving in their care. A heartfelt thank you to the wonderful team of teachers and staff! :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109197073465188696128/reviews
Goh Kuan Yee,5,"My daughter (N1 this year) has been with MFS East Point since she was in Playgroup and our experience has been really great! Her teachers have been amazing (shoutout to Teacher Farah and Min Ling Lao Shi!!) and they make sure each child feels loved and seen, which is so important in the early years. The turnover rate is low too and the same team of teachers has been working together for years :)

Even though our family has shifted further away from the school and our travelling time has doubled since, we are still continuing with the school as our daughter really loves it here. In fact, we are looking to enrol our youngest child to the same branch once she is 18 months too :)

Thank you for providing a safe space for our child to develop and to grow confidently!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101056537572843860222/reviews
Glenda Sim,5,"100% recommend!! I highly commend the teachers in MyFirstSkool Eastpoint Mall!

The curriculum is top notch! From educational to holistic learning, indoors and outdoors, various school trips (which enhances their learning so much!), engaging various vendors to come and share as well as organising family activities!

And it’s not just the curriculum! The teachers are very engaging, full of love and care towards each and every student. They learn, understand and cater to each individual child with compassion and nurturing attitude.

Even the Principal and Admin team has been incredibly helpful w any assistance and provide swift and efficient actions!

Amazing amazing team of educators! And I cannot ask for a more loving and caring team of teachers to hold my children’s hands as they grow and develop under them.

(Special thank you to Tr Farah, Min Ling Laoshi (N1 Friendship B) and Tr Rina, Tr Bee and Cai Laoshi (Sharing B))",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103365302716661937182/reviews
yong wk,1,"Enroll since Nov 2022 and i have been ENROLLING again and again. Only until this year when i see my neighbours' toddler all went in.  When i called in, the CSO said I'm still in waiting list. Well done My First Skool.
How long should i be waiting in the waiting list? Until my kid is K1? Its been 1 year 9 months in the waiting list! When i asked if I'm the next in the waiting list... they tell me it's all computer control.  Super high handed.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111371959815864435516/reviews
