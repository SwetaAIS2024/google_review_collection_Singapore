Francis Oh,5,"The Couple Hawkers are super friendly, the lady boss remembers all her regular customers orders, It is always very enjoyable to patronise them. The food taste fantastic especially the mince meat noodles and the special add on meatballs which taste superb.

Their prawn noodles use fresh prawns and not frozen prawns. The stall owners spend an hour plus to peel the shells of over 1000 prawns. 💪💪

👍👍👍😋😋😋🥰🥰🥰",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109797442713807425214/reviews

Wendy Toh,5,One of my favorite “must go” noodle shop when I crave for laksa and meat ball noodle… you will never regret it once ya tried it.

Elly Wu,5,"Noodle 123 serves delicious noodles at an affordable price. I would like to give a special shoutout to the owner who is ever-patient in attending to customers' requests to ensure that each bowl of noodles is customised according to individual's preferences (& also for going an extra mile to remember customer's preferences for those who patronises his stall frequently)!

Will definitely recommend everyone to try it out :)!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115979061178427247140/reviews
