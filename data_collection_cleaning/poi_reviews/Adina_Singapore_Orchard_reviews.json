      "text": "Checked out today after an 8-night stay, and unfortunately, the experience was far from satisfactory. For the high apartment rates, the value simply isn’t there. Unlike a good four-star hotel that offers a well-rounded experience, including breakfast, here you get none of that—just an overpriced stay with no added perks.\n\nAmenities are practically non-existent, except for a pool. There’s absolutely nothing for kids, making it a dull and frustrating experience for families. With no lobby, the only option for spending time together is the living area of the apartment, which feels restrictive and isolating.\n\nFor the price they charge, I expected much better facilities and service. Would not recommend for families looking for a comfortable and engaging stay.",

The pool was out of use most of the time due to renovations. Of course, sometimes the property needs maintenance, it is understandable. What I really liked was that cleaning took place 4 (or 3? cannot remember) times a week. This made the space feel more like my own.",

Only a 5 min walk to two MRT subway stations which can get you anywhere in the city in not too much time. Vani and all of the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating! Breakfast was nice (mostly continental) and the rooftop pool was very pretty and relaxing. Would definitely recommend staying here for anyone visiting Singapore and needing a good base for exploring.",

The service it provides is quite unique as it can be positioned somewhere between a hotel and an apartment rental.\nThe apartment was well furnished with fully equipped kitchen, dinnerware and washing machine and drier combined. The swimming pool is perfect for relaxing.\nThe location is close to Orchard road and malls but far away enough to be quiet and walking distance to multiple MRT and bus stations.",
