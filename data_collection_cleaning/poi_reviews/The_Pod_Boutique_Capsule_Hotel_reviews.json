I appreciated the coworking space and the small room for calls.\n\nIf you prefer easy access, request a lower deck bed—I found climbing up and down quite a workout! The location is perfect, with easy access to food and public transport.",

      "text": "Lovely place to stay in Singapore.\nHonestly a very pleasing experience.\nAs Singapore being an expensive city, it was very nice to have this type of hostel in Singapore. This capsule hotel is well communicated with central sin, not that much with metro (10-12 walking from hostel to Bagis MRT station ) but very well connected by bus to marina sands, Chinatown and Orchard street. Nice private rooms, very clean, cozy and comfortable bed.\nSimilarly very clean toilets and showers.\nAn amazing thing is that you can leave your luggage at reception so you can pick it up when you head up to the airport/bus station etc.\nWill definitely be coming back to this hostel the next time I come back to Singapore!!!",

      "text": "Unfortunately, I had a disappointing experience at The Pod and have still not received a response to any of the emails I sent directly to the hostel since January—it’s now nearly three months later, so I’m resorting to writing a review in hopes of finally hearing back.\n\nWhen I arrived, the front entry and elevator lobby smelled strongly of mildew/mold. The room I was assigned was hot, with AC units that weren’t cooling the space, and it also had a strong mold/mildew smell. As someone who is very sensitive to these conditions and already had a migraine upon arrival, I couldn’t stay in the room comfortably.\n\nI explained this to the front desk staff, Maigo, and asked to switch rooms. He was very understanding and helpful, and had one of the female staff show me to another female dorm room, which did not have any mold or mildew smell. However, the only available bed was next to a window facing a busy street, which was too noisy for me. I decided to try my original room again just to rest, but once I got into bed, I realized the bedding was damp—likely due to poor ventilation and high humidity. I returned to the front desk and was told the only other option was a mixed dorm with front entry, even though I had booked (and paid more for) a female dorm with side entry.\n\nMaigo then kindly showed me the mixed dorm, and thankfully there was no mold or mildew smell. I agreed to stay there—even though I preferred being in a female dorm—and mentioned that I had paid more for my original booking, but the mold/mildew was the deciding factor. He was understanding and said a price adjustment could be made if the third-party booking site contacted the hostel for approval.\n\nA week or so later, I followed up with the third-party site about the situation, and they kept informing me that they had not received a response from the hostel. This was surprising, since I had spoken directly with Maigo only days earlier. After several back-and-forths with the third party, I reached out to the hostel myself via email and their contact form—multiple times—but never received a reply. I’m disappointed that after such a positive and understanding conversation in person, there has been no follow-up or response.\n\nOne other thing worth noting, there are security cameras in the bathroom area—not inside the toilets/showers (which are behind closed doors), but by the sinks. It was a bit uncomfortable knowing people are doing their hair, skincare, or possibly coming out of the shower in that area, possibly unaware there’s a camera overhead.\n\nOn the positive side, the location is great—within walking distance to the train, buses, restaurants, coffee shops, and more. The bathrooms were also very clean.\n\nOverall, the staff seemed genuinely understanding and accommodating about the situation—even acknowledging the mold/mildew smell. However, the biggest factors contributing to the lower rating were the persistent smell of mold/mildew throughout the lobby and rooms, likely due to poor ventilation, and the ongoing lack of response after my stay.",

      "text": "The brain child behind this place is truly amazing. We booked the Queen bed in a mixed room and you get exactly what the pictures looked like. Between this and some others that I considered, I chose this mainly for the good reviews and the fact that they give you 4 pillows. We knew we will not spend that much time in the room and needed somewhere to safely access, store luggage and accessible to the places we wanted to tour. I came with an open mind and was impressed by the decisions made to make this place attractive. The bed was very comfortable and there's a space to tuck your luggage in and it's card swipe protected. There are a number of bathrooms. So you can use your bowels and immediately jump into the shower after. The shower has body wash and shampoo and most importantly, hot water. There are blinds to give you a measure of privacy and the lights are controlled and turned off from 11 pm to 8am. After two days of running around I just wanted to sink into a comfy chair and lounge. So I went downstairs and used the common spaces. I loved that they had unlimited drinking water, tea and coffee. There's a bus stop right in front of the location. It ticked all my boxes and to make me love them more, they gave hubby a little souvenir and wished him a happy birthday. Like I said, your comfort has been taken into consideration!",

You have very good reception service, you got good cafeteria, you can connect with people, good washroom, good pod, you have personal lockers beside the pod. Safe.hygiene. Free coffee and water. Very good for couples as well those who try to travel. If you want full privacy then obviously you should book a hotel, but lots of couples do live here as it’s super safe and cozy. You get to meet lot of people but you should be extrovert. I got 4 friends here from Japan Indonesia Dubai and Mongolia.",
