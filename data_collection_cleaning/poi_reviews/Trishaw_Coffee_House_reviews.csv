Paoh T,2,"Rather empty on a weekday night with less than 4 different groups or patrons.

We ordered both Asian and Western cuisines, and the food we ordered took a long time before they served. It might be because they were short staffed.

Skip the Asian dishes like their rice and noodles. XO fried rice tasted too salty. Ordered laksa but unfortunately the gravy tasted closer to curry gravy than laksa gravy.
The western dishes tasted average.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105891353757394313385/reviews
Tan Wei Rong,5,"We certainly enjoyed the food and service. Cutleries are clean. Laksa soup is well balanced, not too spicy. Curry chicken is also yummy, not spicy at all. Suitable for children and people who donâ€™t take spicy food. The accompanying rice is very well plated, even use banana leaf. Itâ€™s a delightful surprise for us. Hor fan can taste the wok hey, good. We think itâ€™s quite under-rated, given the quality of food that we tried. The billing receipt also quite nostalgic, hand-written old-school style.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116542987191918251333/reviews
Le Rock Steady,4,"Old school coffee house ambience and food bringing back memories of yesteryear. Went mainly for the ice cream at the trishaw seat for nostalgia.
FYI : we didn't get any tummy upset ðŸ˜‚, unlike one of the other reviews.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115013846059878367663/reviews

Michelle Choo,1,"Had a meeting there with six others.

I was not keen to meet after reading the reviews prior to my first visit there.

I thought since itâ€™s always not crowded - the food cannot be that freshâ€¦

However, I still gave it a try since majority of the team decided to meet there.

Sadly, my hypothesis was proven right!!

I had such a bad food poisoning after my dinner was done! I had to rush to the washroom twice before the meeting ended.

That was my first time to Trishaw Cafe n certainly my LAST time there!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105446749475869169888/reviews
