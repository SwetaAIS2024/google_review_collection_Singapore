      "text": "First and foremost, FINALLY I found the clinic!!! that clears my doubt and worries to getting me back to what I enjoyed doing on daily basis . Before its was trial and error trying different clinics but nothing comes close to what I’m seeing in terms of recovery, in terms of posture correction &  bone alignment or even advise on how to maximise my potential in terms of strength, endurance and muscle stability.\n\nLife Chiropractic centre did answers all my concerns and doubts I have, And yes ! , you read it correctly. Dr Jesse understood what I’m going through, others than just spine health , he does also highlight what cause this or that to happened and it’s been 4 months and I see a drastic increase and change and I feel better each visit each time.\n\nThe front reception (JJ and Sam) are very welcoming, their smiles always makes the room brighter and positive. That’s absolute gold !!!\n\nKeep up the good job guys !!!",

They were thorough in explaining my condition and the treatment plan, ensuring I felt comfortable throughout the process. The adjustments were effective, and I noticed significant improvement in my back pain and posture after a couple of sessions. The clinic is well-maintained, and the overall atmosphere is calming. Highly recommend to anyone seeking chiropractic care in the area!",

      "text": "Long-term regular of this chiropractic centre for about 5 years. (I gave a rating 4 years ago but neglected to leave a review then)\n\nA lot has changed with this chiropractic centre since I first came in. Dr Brian, the original founder of the centre, left at the end of 2021, bringing in a change of management to take over the centre. Nevertheless, his successor, Dr Marcus, still continues to deliver a similar level of care as Dr Brian did for my perennially poor posture (though with more force than Dr Brian did)\n\nAmbiance music and free hot/cold water for patients has been a staple for the centre for a long time. The centre also recently started a \"reward system\" for patients who write Google reviews, which explains the recent trickle of reviews. There's also a new New Year lucky draw too.",
