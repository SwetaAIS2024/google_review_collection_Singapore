      "text": "Love the Matcha Latte and Leaf Pie, they go so well together! The Matcha Latte is not too sweet with medium matcha intensity, and sweetened slightly with their delicious whipped foam. The Daily Coffee is pretty good too, with their special blend. Would recommend for anyone in the area looking for a short coffee break. I‚Äôd love to try the Matcha Affogato next!!\n\nOh, by the way I love the sando ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Sooo good ü§åü§åü§å must try!",

I had an iced Kilimanjaro single origin light roast, which they brewed for me using a Simplify dripper.\n\nThis is also a great spot to shop for coffee equipment - drippers, kettles, coffee cups and bottles from brands like Kono, Origami, Hario, Timemore.\n\nWill return for more the next time I‚Äôm in Singapore!",
