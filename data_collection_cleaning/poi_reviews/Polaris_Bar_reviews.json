      "text": "The restaurant had a delightful ambiance, substantially enhanced by the live violin and piano performance. All the dishes we ordered, from the fried halibut and steak to the lamb shank and foie gras, were not only delicious but also beautifully presented. However, one area that could use improvement was the soft-spoken waitress who made it really difficult for us to hear her. Her introduction to the menu using a tiny iPad, while holding it in her hand, felt awkward and made it really difficult for us to see the menu and hear her properly. It would have been so much better if she had introduced the menu while we were holding the menu ourselves, allowing us to fully understand and appreciate her explanations. So, don’t need to whisper lah. The other waiters at the same restaurant were speaking loud and clear.",

I really hope they can improve their short.\n\nAfter finish our dishes, they apologized to us and gave us some free snacks and drinks. So far so good, their service is good.",
