Caden Tan,3,The ice cream was very nice but at the same time very expensive i would say its not really worth buying i mean $4.70 for a scoop is not really worth it but if you want to buy i would reccomand the cookie monster flavour it is very delicious!,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107290827517981490343/reviews
Berlinda Goh,4,"We always come here for the waffles - really 1 of the best among ice cream cafes, crisp exterior n fluffy inside!

Ice cream flavours we liked and regularly order :
Cookie Monster
Speculoos
Pistachio
Honeycomb

Tried the cappuccino n latte, the latte was more like a diluted flat white.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100207240187708698568/reviews

Ignatius Lim,5,"A quaint little ice cream shop nestled in the humble corners of Telok Blangah.

Atmosphere was nice and quiet as we visited on a Saturday afternoon, the neon lights were a great complement to the vibe, gives kind of like an American diner feel to the place!

With GST & Service Charge, a Waffle with 3 Ice Cream flavours set us back ~$16.

Firstly, the waffle was great. Crispy on the outside with airy, fluffy texture on the inside, delectable üòã

We ordered three flavours: Yoghurt Oreo, Milo Mallow and Hazelnut Truffle.

Yoghurt Oreo had kind of a sour, cheesecakey feel to it with chunks of crushed oreo. Was rather balanced but not my cup of tea! Definitely worth a try though.

The Milo Mallow was awesome! Sweet chocolate ice cream paired with soft marshmallow chunks somehow works so well I don‚Äôt know why more places don‚Äôt have the flavour. Seriously great!

Hazelnut Truffle was really nice too but definitely on the sweeter side. If I were to describe it I suppose it would be ice cream ferraro rochet. I believe that encapsulates the entire essence of the flavour.

Overall, the waffles and ice cream portions and flavour were good at the price point, with a nice atmosphere it‚Äôs surely somewhere you‚Äôd want to visit if you ever find yourself in the area! Will come back again!!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110032560714692350770/reviews
