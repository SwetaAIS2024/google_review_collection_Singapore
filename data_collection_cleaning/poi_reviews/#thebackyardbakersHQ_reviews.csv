argh c,5,"Scrumptious and oh so delicious. No nuts except as easily visible and avoidable toppings. Don‚Äôt miss it destination for chocoholics. Not cheap, but totally worth it. Cash only.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107945476213341647743/reviews
YT,5,"Really the best brownie i have tasted! Came back the next day again to buy! The brownie was a perfect balance of rich, decadent chocolate and the subtle saltiness from the Himalayan salt makes each bite heavenly. If you‚Äôre a chocolate lover, this is a must-try!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116335289933602715039/reviews
T T,4,"Come here for THE MOST DECADENT brownies ever! They are super indulgent, moist, and perfect for those who like their chocolate dark and with in-your-face level of richness.

I tried the chewy fudge brownies today and could only get through less than 1/3 of it - will save the rest for another day! It‚Äôs just pure, premium chocolatey goodness. Best shared because it really packs a punch.

The banana bread is also a must-try, and constantly sold out. Pre-ordering in advance would be the safest bet!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101419297734532688604/reviews
Lyon Bakes,5,"Lovely brownies you just dig into. Super sinful as you dig into and forget about the calories.

Have tried almost every other flavors. Still the Valrhona dark chocolate with sea salt is my favorite. Can‚Äôt go wrong with it.

Not cheap as 4 pieces easily sets your back with S$30+ as each diff flavor has a different price tag.

Yet to try out their other food items.

Will be back for more but can‚Äôt be a daily affair. Else I need to worth extra hard to shed those calories.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107552928553169969294/reviews
Kara Mok,5,"Whenever I think of avocado toast, it has to be backyard bakers. They‚Äôve perfected it and  though price isn‚Äôt cheap, the quality sure makes it worth it. I can safely say that their mala options, herbivore are yummy and have kept the standard.

On my most recent visit, I decided to try their otah and I was blown away by how generous they were in the otah serving and how yummy it was.

Their brookies and muffins blows my chocolate loving soul off. üëçüèº",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109629577346332010040/reviews
