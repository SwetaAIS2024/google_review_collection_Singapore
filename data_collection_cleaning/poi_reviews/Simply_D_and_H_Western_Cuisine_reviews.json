      "text": "Located under my block [31 Holland Close], it is owned by Moeslem.\n\nIn my opinion, ayam taliwang is spicy enough. Mushroom spaghetti is also tasty. In addition to the price, raw ingredients are now also very expensive. So, the price was considered normal.\n\nHopefully this stall will remain at 31 Holland Close for a longer period of time. As, it is so hard to find halal or moeslem food here.",

Okay if i pay a price of $7.00, i dont expect it to be super perfect. What i received is Sphagetti, Ham & Mushroom with Mushroom soup as gravy. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!",
