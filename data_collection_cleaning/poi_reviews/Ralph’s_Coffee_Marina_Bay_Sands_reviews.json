Had a cup of hot chocolate—tasted fine, though a bit disappointed that marshmallows were no longer available.",

However, despite the quiet atmosphere, the staff were completely unresponsive, even when we tried to get their attention, which quickly left us feeling frustrated and unwelcome.\n\nThat said, the coffee was excellent—rich in aroma and taste, far superior to what you’d find at certain well-known chain cafés.\nThe delightful coffee alone makes me want to return, but next time, I might consider trying a different location to see if the service is better elsewhere.",

They even offered us a small complimentary cup of ice cream while we were waiting for a table. Decor is nice, and signature Ralph Lauren. Would go back again, just for the chocolate chip cookie!",
