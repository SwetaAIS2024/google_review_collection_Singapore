Highly recommend!\n\nPros:\n- Great portion for its price ($4.50 for Teriyaki Chicken, as of Dec 2024)\n- Delicious seasoning and tender meat\n- Uncle is a genuine, sincere chef who takes pride in his cooking\n\nCons:\n- Age has caught up to the chef. His hearing is not as good as it used to be. Recommend speaking louder and in simple English.\n- His imperfect hearing leads to some to perceive him his tone as ‚Äúrude‚Äù. Recommend being patient and speaking with empathy as uncle has aged.",

The boss is very hard-working and friendly don't be taken aback when he talks loud because the environment is noisy. I also recommend their salmon dishes which are very popular. Do visit early as there will be a take out queue that form during peak hours. Highly recommended and a culinary gem that showcase the best of Japanese food at down to earth pricing. üíé",
