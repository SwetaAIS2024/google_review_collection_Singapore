Damcho Tshering,5,"Visited the Fort Canning Heritage Gallery, a place steeped in history and significance. Walking through the exhibits, I was transported back in time to understand how Fort Canning Hill has played such a central role in Singapore’s journey—from being the seat of ancient Malay royalty to its pivotal role during WWII.

The gallery’s displays of archaeological finds, historical artefacts, and interactive exhibits were incredibly engaging. I found myself reflecting on the layers of history that this hill holds—how it has witnessed power, war, and transformation over centuries.

Exploring the gallery was more than just a history lesson; it was a reminder of how much we can learn from the past. Surrounded by the tranquil greenery of Fort Canning Park, it felt like the perfect blend of nature and heritage.

If you’re in Singapore and haven’t been here yet, I’d highly recommend a visit. It’s a place where stories of the past come alive, leaving you with a deeper appreciation of this island's rich legacy.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833702802756994837/reviews
Miles Macdonald,5,"Excellent place, which takes you through the history of Singapore from its founding as Singapura ""Lion City"" in 1299 through to present day. The chronology as you start the exhibition details all the key events in the country's history. As an Englishman, I was particularly interested in the impact that Sir Stamford Raffles had when, under an agreement signed in 1819, he secured substantial control of the territory. Lots of information available and well presented. You learn how brutal the Japanese occupation was when they took control in 1942. I've included a lot of the information boards in my photo attachments for those who wish to learn more.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112943810663501022344/reviews

Ju Amir,5,"A very well thought out gallery with multiple interactive exhibits. There are lots of information that was included that I did not even know prior to this visit.

Love how they tied in the history of the park into the gallery itself. A definite must visit for anyone who is in the vicinity.

Wish there was a retail store within the compound to buy some mementos, books, spices, magnets etc.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101135721596085985310/reviews
