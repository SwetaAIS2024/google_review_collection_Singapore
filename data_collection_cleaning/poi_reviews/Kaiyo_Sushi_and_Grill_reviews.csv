Ann L,2,"I really have to put it in a very diplomatic way but it is difficult. The tempura batter reminded me of goreng pisang. Grilled shiitake tasted raw and only the charred bits hinted that the 2 skewers with 8 SLICES of mushroom was actually cooked partially. By the way it was priced at 6 dollars and i think that is the most profitable, by percentage, dish for the restaurant!

Thankfully we ordered sashimi that need not be cooked and so ate something that resembles Japanese cuisine.

Only saving grace is there are enough tables and space in the restaurant so you can hang out for hours if you don't mind sub-standard stuff.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103657010349229508636/reviews
Audrey Tan,5,"Although they were packed on Friday night (all the Valentine's day warriors), service was brisk and courteous. Sashimi slices were thicc and fresh. Udon is not my usual thicc texture either but simple and satisfying. Chawanmushi came at the end but was a warming finishing touch to a very nice meal. Will be back again to try their other dishes!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100537510928931715089/reviews

Marcel Yap,2,"idk why i saved it to go to but tbh the food isn't great and it's quite expensive and not worth thr price so 2 stars instead of 3
The unagi bowl I had was really dry there was just a layer of sauce on the unagi and none on the rice so it's just hard to eat
the wasabi octopus was p good tho
the fried sushi we got was underwhelming i thought it would be something unique but it's just mid and I can't even taste the salmon
again the food is mid but for the price it's bad",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114696497557638005372/reviews
