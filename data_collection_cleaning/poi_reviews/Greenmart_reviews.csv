Kenshino,1,"I recently picked up my parcel at Bedok North (Green Mart) and was disappointed by the service I received. The Chinese woman working there, who appeared to be in her late 40s to early 50s, had a poor attitude. When I arrived to collect my item within the collection timing, she gave me a disapproving look. Today, as I stood quietly waiting for her to assist me, she angrily sorted parcels into a trash bag. When she finally addressed me, she did so with hostility, slapping the trash bag and demanding my pin number. Despite her rude behavior, I remained composed, provided my pin number, retrieved my parcel, thanked her, and left without receiving any acknowledgment in return. Buyers like us do not deserve this.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100708320658439348248/reviews

Now my children does not like going to greenmart. Besides from that, you have to wait 5-15 minutes if you want to collect your parcel because usually there is no one there.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106441836395605769972/reviews
Yan Hua Lim,1,"Worst service by the boss himself! If you‚Äôve read the other reviews on the so-so customer service by the staff, just want to share that the boss is even more horrendous.

Never gonna use the store as a Shopee collection point anymore, and definitely not patronising as a customer!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111752942371265356810/reviews
