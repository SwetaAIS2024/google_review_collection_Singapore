Portion is well worth the price.\nFor those who dislike garlic, this might not be in your favour..\nFor garlic lovers, this is the go-to place..",

Lots of ingredients, fishball, meat ball, minced meat, beancurd sticks...$4\n\nI love the kway teow kia dry too. Special mention of the Mexican style salsa/cincalok condiment that you can help yourself with, add it to my noodles for extra oomph",

      "text": "Koay Teow Kia is Hokkien for flat rice noodles. In different places, it has different meanings. Eg, in JB, Kway Teow Kia means Kway Chap. In Penang, it’s normally rice noodles with fishballs in soup, which they call Koay Teow Tng\n\nSo this stall caught my attention because the concoctions are not what I am used to in Penang. I ordered the #2 set (Mee Kia) and added three Fuzhou fishballs for $2.\n\nLove the noodles. Al dente and well coated with dark sauce and chilli. Lots of ingredients and the sliced taro was exceptionally good, being the powdery type. At $4 a bowl, it’s a steal considering the runaway inflation in Singapore.\n\nBut the Fuzhou fishballs were disappointing. They were rather bland, borderline tasteless, even with the sambal ikan bilis sauce that they come coated with. Not what my experience with Fuzhou fishballs has been in the region and in Fuzhou itself. Can skip.\n\nExpect longer queues during meal times.",
