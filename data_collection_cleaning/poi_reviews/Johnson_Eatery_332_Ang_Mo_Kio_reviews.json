I went there 3 weeks in a row and ordered the same dishes (because the children are picky) but the price increased from 6, to 7 to eventually 10 dollars!  The following week, my dad paid 3.80 for the same dishes!  He speculated they are increasing price because the last 2 times I ordered I was using CDC vouchers.  I dont support dishonest hawkers and won't be ordered at the cai png stall again.",
