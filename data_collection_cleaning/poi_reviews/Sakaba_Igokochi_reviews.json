Chose the omakase and was not disappointed at all for food.\n\nThe problem was that they didn’t tell us the kitchen closes at 9:30PM, which means all my food was rushed. I had one dish in front of me then the next came before I finished. I wasn’t sure why until I found out later on. In the future I think it would be better appreciated if they had informed us beforehand so we will choose ala carte rather than a course meal.\n\nThe food was delightful but the waitress often did not explain what the food was. The other more experienced staff did when he came by to check on us.\n\nI’d recommend to come! But definitely before 8PM. My favourite dish was the first dish with delectable salad dressing and yellowtail, but every dish was delightful.",

The cold soba was another highlight; the noodles were cooked to the ideal texture and served with a refreshing, well-balanced dip.\nThe tebasaki has a unique taste. Worth trying.",
