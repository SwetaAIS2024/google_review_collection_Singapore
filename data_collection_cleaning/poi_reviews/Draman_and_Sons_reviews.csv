G M,5,"Traditional, authentic, aromatic old school Satay, (sharing stall with Draman’s Biryani)
I’ve been having this hidden gem of best traditional satay for over 40 years from Hamzah who was the original iconic Master satay chef at Satay Solo ( opposite stall) for many years.

Please Note - Hamzah has recently moved out to share a stall with Draman Biryani in the same food centre at Bedok Corner ( opposite Bedok camp) where he continues the old fashioned way of barbecuing satay with a hand held straw fan over the charcoal stove and maintaining  the highest standard of satay.

Beautifully marinated, charred just right, tender best tasting satay where the aroma is further enhanced by little bits of crushed grilled spices. The peanut sauce is just perfect, thick with some chunky bits that clings onto the perfectly textured ketupat ( rice cake).
Amazing satay that brings back decades of wonderful memories of how satay used to be in the olden days.

Historical fact - Hamzah has been selling satay for over 50 years since taking over from his mother who was at the old canopy Bedok Beach stalls next to Bedok army camp, across the road.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111893506303575252503/reviews
Mantou,4,"Agree with the review here, the potion is generous. Both the chicken and the mutton were nice and flavourful, wish the briyani rice were as flavourful. The Tulang not the usual Tulang merah, more like a rendang, nice for a change but wish it's cook longer as not tender enough. Overall nice",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118213126945726447138/reviews
Sean Yong,4,"One of the better briyanis in Bedok.  Very generous with the rice and mutton.  If you like dark gravy mutton, then you must try this.  Sometimes you get bone in with nice soft tissue and lots of meat.  Love it!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108535124596952191042/reviews
Ed,4,"Looking for Britain and chanced upon this at Bedok Road.
The serving was decent and had a big chunk of mutton smothered with rice.
The rice was very light and tasty, the meat easily came off bone. One of the best dum briyani I’ve had so I’m a fan now.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104056554846052732887/reviews
Kacax,5,"Best Briyani in the East, everything executed perfectly, rice is light and fluffy, dum briyani mutton/chicken not oily but very flavourful, dalcha sedap.

1 of the very few hawker Briyani that is very aromatic, high quality and the price reflect that. Very underrated and even better than more popular Briyanis, I had them when they used to sell at Mukmin.

Huge portion but priced quite high, top 5 Briyani in SG to me. Only con, taste not consistent, certain days top notch, certain days a little off. This taste very similar to Anjaniman Briyani but a notch better. Do give them a try.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103839386838101393779/reviews
