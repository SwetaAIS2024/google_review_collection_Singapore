Nurfilzah Izzati,1,"This is my second visit to this clinic, and I don’t remember my first visit being this disappointing. DR. HASHIM JOHAN is extremely unfriendly, and the way he speaks to patients comes across as rude.

When I registered, I informed the male receptionist that I was pregnant, and he said he would note it in the system. However, during my consultation with the doctor, the atmosphere was tense, and he seemed unfriendly throughout. At the end of the consultation, I reminded him that I am pregnant. To my shock, he sighed and reprimanded me, saying, “That should be the first thing you should have said.”

I was taken aback and explained that I had already informed the staff at the front desk. He then replied, “No, the people outside are not doctors. I am the doctor. You shouldn’t trust the people outside.”

I was absolutely stunned by his attitude! If you’re planning to visit this clinic, I strongly recommend calling ahead to check who the doctor on duty is. Avoid DR. HASHIM JOHAN if possible!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100744550504638456482/reviews

Sana M,1,"I don't know about other doctors. But would definitely not recommend Dr. Hashim. His diagnosis is way off and he doesn't listen. My husband went in after he vomited multiple times. He was very weak and went in for an emergency consultation. The doctor never listened to him and gave him a medication for cold (cetrizine)?? I mean are you serious? My husband was trying to explain and this guy just brushed him off. And since it was around Closing time in the afternoon, he was in such a rush to leave that he didn't even pay attention to the symptoms.

As a non medical professional, even i knew it was related to gastritis and I urged my husband to visit another clinic where the doctor gave him the right medication for gastritis. Without it, my husband couldn't have had any food and would have suffered overnight.

This is very unethical of Dr. Hashim. If you can't be a doctor, just don't be. We were able to still manage since I had some idea about the issue. What if it was innocent patients who just follow you blindly? I cannot even image the plight of such people.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103688606051133256897/reviews
