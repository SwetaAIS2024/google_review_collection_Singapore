We were served by Miss Loo, who was incredibly polite and helpful — she recommended several dishes that we ended up loving. Excellent service all around. We’ll definitely be returning!",

All other staffs are equally good and friendly and always attentive to every table. You’ll always feel welcome coming here. Had lala steamboat and it tasted truly amazing. It’s a must try! Thanks for the great food and even greater service!",

Anyhow, Macau has lala pots many years ago before JB did, all they did was to copy the concept and this House of Seafood copied from the Johor Bahru copycats lol. Honestly would rather eat their crabs, more worth it.",

Not the food but it was a windless night.\nWe took advantage of the 20% grabpay offer.\nThis is part of House of Seafood so … not saying anything. We were billed the wrong table when we checked out. Good thing wifey checked the bill or we would be paying for our next table.",
