David Adams,5,"My family and I  have been patients of Citimed for over 20 years in my case and 15 years and less for my wife and 3 children. In the majority of visits we have been seen to by Dr Chan.
We have never received anything but professional and courteous treatment. Yes sometimes it is necessary to wait  this is mostly due to overal demand and most likely caused to the time taken to obtain a thorough diagnosis which I have always found to the case.
NOTE: When reading reviews take into account the number of unhappy patients/ customers v those that have been very well taken care and take into account its the complainers who write in and the multitude of happy patients / customers rarely do so. This applies to medical practices , restaurants or white goods suppliers.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111249361108500406142/reviews

N A,1,"Called to ask for medical treatment details, suggested to email. 1st correspond was good with clarification. But they ‘scolded’ me for not answering their calls to make appoinment because i only managed to revert the next day. Demanded me for answer why the calls were not answered. Tried to explain but insisted why the calls were not answered. Thanks for calling back but rather forgo the stress with such frontliners. Thanks.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111355499071350216992/reviews
