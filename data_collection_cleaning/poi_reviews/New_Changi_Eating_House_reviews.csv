Rajen Arasu,4,"Usually at the coffee shop for my CKT (Char Kway Teow)  fix at the Katong Jago stall in the evening. In the morning I'll have their Fried Carrot Cake. The CKT has sufficient ""wok hei"" and is quite good containing sliced lap cheong (chinese sausage), fish cake and blood cockles. Tastes equally good when you takeaway. Only minor complaint is the minute size of the blood cockles and insufficient pork lard cracklings (IMO). In the mornings the stall serves  Fried Carrot Cake which is quite good as well.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113317460774650179369/reviews
Richard See,4,"22 Oct 2023: AMPANG QQ no longer there; stall taken over by AL AASHIRA…prata, mee goreng, Indian rojak and more. There is another AL AASHIRA stall in the same coffee shop and we ordered Appam from them. Taste and texture is more like thosai; not the typical appam that is fluffy in the centre and crispy at the edge.

30 Aug 2022: The Black and White carrot cake from KATONG JAGO is really good…simply soft and yummy. AH YEE CONGEE…still as smooth, tasty and very satisfying comfort food.

Leonard Wee,3,Smokiest sitting area even if they don't allow smoking while seated. Coffee and drinks queue always long and they stop serving drinks for many years. Gotta queue and line up. Horrid,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116841518027778345489/reviews
