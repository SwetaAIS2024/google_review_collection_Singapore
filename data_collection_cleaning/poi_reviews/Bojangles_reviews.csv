Murali Nalamarthu,1,"Remove the male customer service guy before i escalate the matter to higher level...saw him talking very rudely to other customers and he was very cold and no customer service..

Jimmy Teo,5,"Stumbled upon this place after a stroll at rail corridor. It's a nice cozy place that serves affordable beers with good service. Perfect place to chill out with your buddies. Oh yeah, they were screening soccer match when I was there, so plus points if u are a football fan",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112078231109976433931/reviews
Mohana Marimuthu,1,"Poor and abrupt customer service . After all we were the only 2 first customers at 3pm. The guy was so cold, it was like he got up on the wrong side of the bed.
He is working in the wrong industry or he just can't be bothered ðŸ˜¡
The female lady was pleasant and customer service oriented.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114984770330193670702/reviews
Paul Ashton,4,"Good dive bar. Happy hour till 7:30pm (can pre-order beers before cutoff, but they all come at 7:30pm)..pool table SGD$2 a go...good for giggle...not a main hangout...but ok for a local bar. Plenty of 80s and 90s music. Also bottle keep available for spirits, with mixers provided FOC.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101743146842337789649/reviews
John Cheng,1,"The male bar tender is super rude, ask him for food menu, ask me to refer the menu on the table myself (in an impatient tone), after I decided what I want, then he tell me the food is not ready to order yet, must wait till 6pm??  Funny enough, I saw someone ordering food around 5:30pm. Seriously, if you hate your job that much, maybe find something else to do. Wonâ€™t be coming back here.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109161324228165405264/reviews
