Meng Fai Yip,5,"First hike of 2025! It was an AMAZING HIKE. We did the following:

Botanic Gardens MRT Station > University Road > Kheam Hock Park > Trail Entrance > Abandoned Cars (two and a half cars) > ""Avatar"" Trees > Bukit Brown Cemetery > Lornie Highway Bus Stop > Adam Food Centre (pit stop, via bus) > Botanic Gardens MRT Station

Highlights of Bukit Brown Cemetery include:
(1) The Gated Tomb (Tomb 8)
(2) Tomb with Sikh Guards (Tomb 16)
(3) Ong Family Complex (Tombs 22 & 23)

Difficulty level = 2 out of 5. It would be good to bring hiking poles along, especially for the first two portions of the Trail.

Chen Weizhi,5,A peaceful place to cycle and walk. There are quite a few people taking a stroll here. There are a lot of unbeaten trails that wind deep into the forest.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104262822998888136081/reviews
Melissa Eisner,5,Delightful slice of history. Seems all of the famous of Singapore families are buried here. There is a lot of history so make sure to read the signs posted besides the graves. There are some places need you to hike to so come with hiking boots and long trousers. And bug spray. But highly recommended and suitable for all ages.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117316308946167178763/reviews
Ice Qu,5,"Getting here is a little interesting what with construction going on nearby but it is worth it. Step into a long lost forest of this nearly a century old cemetery and pay your respects to  the forefathers, foremothers and their descendants as you learn more about Singapore's dynamic and fascinating history.  Wear sturdy shoes, bug repellent, and carry your own water. Also remember to pack out any trash you bring and maybe pick up any trash you see (though there's not a lot of it laying around, thankfulky).
This cemetery is full of art, stories, spirits, love and loss and the circle of life.  You're surrounded by vines upon vines entwined amongst the barrel trunks of trees, wrapped along the facades of gravestones, trailing all, reminding us of our own roots, our own twisted journeys.  A place for discovery of ancestors, of wildlife and wild woods. Highly recommended.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112472682452415767759/reviews
