Food was ready super quick though and plenty of seats available for lunch around 1 pm. Good thing is that the tenders were not fried too oily.",

Today I visited this outlet again, management have seem to change since - franchise to Fei Siong Pte Ltd.\n\nI ordered 3x 3 piece meal, the serving was pathetic. 2 sets came with super small piece of chicken wing, chicken breast & a drumstick. The 3rd set difference was the chicken thigh over the breast. The chicken were tough and cold, this was the same for the Cajun fries. Tap at sink is damage.\nNot recommended. Avoid this outlet at all cost!!!",
