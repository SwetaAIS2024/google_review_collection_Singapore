Staff are attentive and friendly and we were sitted and served rather quickly.\n\nWe ordered beef bowls, sushi and some fried finger food. The beef bowls as they were delicious.  Sushi is fresh and for the fried food uniqueness depended more on the sauces. Beef bowl portion is small for a small eater but adding up everything, portion is just nice.\n\nPrice maybe considered steep. But overall will revisit again for the beef bowls.",

Enjoyed the sashimi salad too - loaded with sashimi cubes, octopus, oranges, tomatoes and salad.\n\nStaff is friendly too.",
