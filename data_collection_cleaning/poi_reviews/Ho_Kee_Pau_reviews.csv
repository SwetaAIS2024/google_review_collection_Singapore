Nick Chan,5,Something is different about this branch that makes the items taste authentic. It may be an older branch but definitely the food is maintained at it's best. Still my fave amongst all the rest of it's branches. Even it's not at the same as yesteryear but I'm contended with the price range.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107958726105754382413/reviews
wang Jessica,5,"Not many branches left , this is the most old school one . Price is reasonable for dim sum. Open air seating for a quick meal",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102697701521068615637/reviews

Shirley NKL,5,Excellent soft and fluffy  buns.  We're ordered a chat Char Siew Bao to try and ended up eating 4 pieces.  A bao that is lovingly made in house a  testament of how a good bao should taste like. Remindedme of the stories that my daddy used to share on the bao of yesteryear.  Awesome!,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107527800723976080799/reviews
KKM KKM,2,"So disappointing. Standard has dropped. But the staff is always lively and pleasant.

Fried and steamed items could be warmer.

The skin of the prawn dumpling is really too thick.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108851748732355049781/reviews
