Atmosphere was nice and lively, live music was also a plus.\n\nOverall, service was normal with the dishes we ordered coming out rather quickly upon ordering. Nice place to chill on a Saturday evening.",

The pasta was rich and flavorful, though it was a bit on the dry side. The pizza, however, was great and definitely stood out. Overall, a solid dining experience!",

The ambiance is fantastic, and the live music creates a perfect atmosphere.\n\nThey also offer a good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.\n\nI really recommend this place if u just want to chill out or hang out with ur friends + tasting the delicious foods",

      "text": "Surprising Find! Awesome vibes & Italian food!\n\nIf you are feeling bougie (fancy), one of my top recommendation!\n\nPizza - Half Smoked Salmon / Half Morning After\nSmoked Salmon was okay, but morning after was awesome! The egg yolk just makes the pizza feel a lot more creamy.\n\nThe flatbread with Brie Cheese was surprising... One of the staff recommended it. The flatbread has a strong garlicky and herby taste. The brie was super creamy and matched perfectly with the honey almond! Perfect combination of sweet and savoury!\n\nEnded the meal with their Tiramisu, although it was slightly pricey, it was worth it!",
