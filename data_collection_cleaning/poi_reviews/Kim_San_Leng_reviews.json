It offers a good selection of not-so-humble foodstalls.\n\nMy favorite ones are: economic rice or porridge, tai seng fish soup, the fish ball noodles and the prawn noodles.",

As i see she was doing some other drinks so i didnt say what i want. And the next thing she say,‚Äù you must tell me what you want‚Äù in mandarin. Bro‚Ä¶. Before that she was alrdy complaining about a customer at the front for not ordering and kept talking. We will order if you are ready. If you are not ready, how do we dare to order?",
