Scooping hard ice cream from the tub is no joke, so tiring.\nAnd when the staff sat down infront of me having their meals, they only took 10mins and quickly go back to work.\nI really think your restaurant is under staff & they are definitely over work.\nPlease reward them accordingly.",

Everything tasted good and you get a good mix of western, asian and seafood. The ice cream was fantastic, huge number of flavours. Overall a really fun experience, did not disappoint!",

Friday lunch, $35 each and after 10% service charge and 9% GST, it came out to be $83.93. The buffet spread was great! Recommend the pasta station and dessert station. Baked rice (fish) tasted bland, Butter chicken was good. Buffet is only given 90mins. The staffs were fast to clear the empty plates which allowed us to take more foods.",
