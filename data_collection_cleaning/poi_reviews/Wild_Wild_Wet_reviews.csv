General Twilight,5,Had great experience here with my family. The price is also affordable for the public. Each ticket is about $30 for each pax. There is a great variety of slides for both children and adults to play in. There are several family themed slides and some for more thrill seekers. It is within walking distance of the mrt station or just 1 bus stop away.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114314523990529053400/reviews

Gatsby,4,"Liked this place as it is not that crowded on weekdays. With annual membership, easy to stop by after school.
It stops all facility when bad weather is coming due to the risk of lightning. There is no compensation for this. You can wait till weather becomes better to enjoy the park or leave in this case.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104607839695805855739/reviews
Stiggy L,4,"Was in early Dec 24, not crowded. Some attractions were closed. All in all is good, lazy river is bigger than Adventure Cove but quality wise adventure cove is better (also a lot more expensive) . Locker price is a bit on the high side too.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112035404327528284334/reviews
