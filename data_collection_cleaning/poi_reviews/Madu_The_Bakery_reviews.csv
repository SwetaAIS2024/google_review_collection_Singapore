Jeffrey Heng,5,"Googled and came to this place as it was near to where I was waiting for my wife. Came around 3 plus pm so parking was very available. Vibes and ambience was pretty good and it exudes a zen feel.

When I was ordering my coffee, I turned to look at the croissants on display and the lady behind the counter recommended for me to try their Cereal Prawn Croissant. Seeing that she was pretty sincere I decided to take her recommendation. This is not an on display item so will need to wait for a while for them to prepare.

When the croissant came, it didn’t disappoint. Looks good, smells good and tastes good. The croissant comes with 3 big pieces of cereal prawn and the prawn was crunchy and nice. Overall a very good croissant and I didn’t regret ordering.

As for my Long Black, it was just normal so I don’t have much comments on that. Definitely can drink but not awesome type.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111822831988646055522/reviews
Matthew Lee,3,"Not sure if its that this place is closing soon, so there were a lot of people wanting to come and give it a try before it closes.
Paid a visit on a public holiday at 10 and there was already a queue at the door. Thankfully we managed to be the first batch of customers into the cafe.
Think the staff were not well prepared for the opening. Wanted to order some items and were told had to wait until 11 before the items become available. So it's like 10-11 is mostly for drinks and we only managed to order a pain au chocolate.
Could see that the queue was getting longer outside but no one was leaving because the food wasn't available yet. So it was finally 11 before people started ordering the food to have a proper meal.
We did order drinks before 11 and ordered more food after 11. First had the cheesy garlic bun which I thought was good though am not really a cheese person. The cereal prawn croissant was also quite innovative and delicious. Ordered the umami mushroom waited for quite a long time. The staff came to tell us it was sold out and asked if they could replace with the mentaiko and we said ok. She came out after 10 minutes to ask the same again, but strange enough she still served us the umami mushroom after a while.
Thought of trying the matcha croissant. Didn't look as lava as was on display but it was decent. The matcha powder was quite good though.
By the time we were about to leave around 12, the display shelf was quite empty and there was still a long queue outside. Looks like they were not prepared to handle big crowd.
Food was overall good and the savoury items were better than the sweet ones. Still have a week before closing so give it a try if you have been thinking about it!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109397825257995094119/reviews
nat reviews,5,"Another place I’ve been meaning to try.

Food and drinks: 5/5
Had the Aerocano, Yuzu espresso tonic and Madu toast lite. Aerocano tastes a lot like Starbucks’ nitrogen coffee but with a lighter taste tone. While Yuzu espresso tonic on the other hand, feels like Aerocano but with the addition of yuzu peels from those Korean honey tea jars you see in supermarkets.

The madu toast looked underwhelming at first, but is actually quite tasty. It was soft and fluffy toast coated in caramelised brown sugar, paired with mascarpone cream.

Service: 4/5
While they were apologetic about sending our drinks to the wrong table, they also reconfirmed if we ordered any food. So both drinks and food orders were essentially messed up. However, it was an easygoing day for me and so I was in a pleasant mood to repeat my orders and wait.

Atmosphere: 3/5
The seats were comfortable but the oily and smokey air stung my eyes and made them really teary by the time I left. My clothes and hair also smelled oily after i left the cafe.

Overall, I would come again. But it would be helpful if they improve their ventilation.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105973186058375958042/reviews
Lynette Koh,4,"Ordered a coconut latte and a truffle bun. The coconut latte wasn’t sweet and the coffee was rather strong and a tad bid too acidic for my liking, but i enjoyed the truffle bun! The truffle cream was generous, and there were bits of luncheon meat to add to the umami flavour. But the bun is quite heavy for the palate, as the truffle cream was already quite rich so the luncheon meat in the bun made the bun too cloying or oily. I loved the vibe in the cafe though, interior was very cozy and inviting and service was great! Would come back to try other stuff on the menu!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104610856914755333480/reviews
Johann Loke,5,"A cafe spawning out of a bakery. The croissants were great, tasted fresh and handmade compared to most central kitchen ones.

What made me impressed was the level of service when the female cashier greeted, explained and guided me through the entire purchasing experience. Probably a first in Singapore as no other cafe has ever had this attention to detail before.

Will be back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106795515849159566778/reviews
