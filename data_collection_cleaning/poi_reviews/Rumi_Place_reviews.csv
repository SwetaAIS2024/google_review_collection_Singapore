Celebr√†itg Chap Goh Mei at this  cafe. First visit for us.

First we ordered lemon slamon come.with pasta. White source and slightly sweet for us. Then we had soto and I like the pekedel (mesh potatoes).

All the waiters were super friendly and attentive. Like their utensil too.

Toilet super clean.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104234572596322175340/reviews
