Nicole Quek,5,"We ordered the Quinta pizza (medium), it was great. Seasoning done well. Dough was thin and crispy.

The ravioli and other two pastas were really good too.

Server (Sharil) was amazing and very supportive in our queries.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113529067165435693059/reviews
Jitya M.Topaz,5,"We visited Spizza Bukit Timah yesterday around 9 PM, even though they close at 10 PM. Despite the late hour, the staff was very accommodating and welcomed our group of nine without hesitation.

We ordered quickly and were pleasantly surprised by the prompt service. The food was generally delicious and well-presented. Some dishes, like the vegetarian pasta and carbonara, were slightly under-seasoned, but nothing a little salt and garnish couldn’t fix.

The highlight of the experience was the service—friendly, humble, and attentive staff who made sure we were comfortable throughout. It’s a cozy place for gatherings, and even though they close relatively early, they went the extra mile to accommodate us.

We spent around $300 ish in total, which we felt was reasonable for the group size and quality of the food and service.

Overall, it was a lovely spontaneous dinner plan that turned out to be a great experience. Thank you, Spizza!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106544907846751999334/reviews
Jason Feuerstein,5,"Always a great experience, regardless of dine in or takeaway. Food is well priced and very good value. May not be the most authentic Italian but still excellent flavours and fresh ingredients.
