johnny chan,1,"Very bad service from the counter staff. 1) they will not entertain any request before 12 noon. 2) one could place the first order but ended up waiting for 20 mins as it doesn't follow first in first out concept 3) overheard them telling a customer to come back later for 60 cts change as they ran out of change when they just started their business for the day 4) seriously, no customer service at all, in a service industry. Think twice before patronizing",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102827125691110950574/reviews
