Alex Ng,5,Review is for Aunty Yong‚Äôs economical Bee Hoon that is only opened in the mornings. Don‚Äôt underestimate the chicken wing here. I‚Äôve been her customer for more than ten years and it‚Äôs because they are well marinated and never bland like other stalls. I‚Äôd also recommend their white Bee Hoon as it has a bit of Chilli in it and thus more flavourful than the black version.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116567255422509387871/reviews

JX L,3,"Economic bee hon is good for mornings. But the mixed rice stall now is expensive compared to 7 mile coffee shop further down, not worth it anymore. Tze Char also changed a while back and standards dropped",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110548650131414433886/reviews
john ‚ÄúDochalliday‚Äù doe,5,"Very nice spot.  Very inexpensive and a real old school eating house feel, in a nondescript suburban neighborhood.  There is a stall inside with pre cooked foods but I ate from the kitchen of the Delicious Eating House itself.  Thai style crispy chicken was awesome; light, sweet, flavorful, fragrant and it had a delightfully lingering spicy heat that crept up on you after a time.  Kangkong in spicy sambal and green beans with dried prawn crumbles were winners.  Die die must try.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104015407175863805503/reviews
