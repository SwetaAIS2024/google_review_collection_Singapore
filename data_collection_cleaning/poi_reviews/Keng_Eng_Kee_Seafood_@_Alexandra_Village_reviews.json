The marmite chicken and butter cereal prawns were served piping hot and they were especially delicious! üòãüòã Highly recommended!\n\nOne friend had fresh coconut juice while I had the water chestnut juice. Our friend who ordered the ambarella juice found it a tad too sweet.\n\nWe arrived around 7.50pm and waited about 20 minutes for a table, and interestingly, we ended up with a large table for ten all to ourselves üòÇ\n\nThe crowd thinned out after 8.45pm, so if you want to get a table more quickly, consider arriving a bit later.\n\nOverall, a really happy dining experience and definitely worth a visit again! üôåüôå\n\n(For the 3 of us, the total bill came up to $91.50)",

      "text": "Chilli crab is like a total flavor bomb, with this awesome sauce that's super rich and tasty. It's thick and wraps around the crab in this spicy-sweet hug. The tomato gives it a tangy kick that just makes the crab's sweetness pop, and everything just blends together perfectly. Every bite is like a flavor explosion, with the chili giving it a nice little heat that sticks around in a good way.\n\nNow, the coffee rib pork is a whole other level of cool. It's like they took regular pork ribs and gave them a coffee makeover. The coffee adds this bold, earthy vibe that‚Äôs both savory and a bit sweet. The ribs are super tender, and the coffee glaze gets all caramelized on top, making it a texture dream. This combo of coffee and pork is just genius and leaves you with this surprisingly awesome taste that you won't forget.",

      "text": "Went there during a Sat right before Mother's Day. I went there earlier before 6pm as I had not made any prior booking for a table. As advised by their staff the early arrival allowed me to secure a table for 6. Service was good as they had pre-empted me that the food may take a while to arrive (around 20 to 30 min). The place was nestled in a pretty rustic housing estate. Lots of wild chicken broods around the area. The food was up to my expectations. Sambal kangkong was great. Lots of sauce. I liked their tofu dish, especially the minced meat that was slightly spicy. The fried rice had good wok hei. Total cost was around 110 for 6 pax. I will consider coming again for their other dishes next time.",

Most of the dishes were tasty, except for one of the crabs we ordered, the meat was not firm and smelly. Finally, the price, we don‚Äôt expect a small plate of morning glory cost $20 dollars, all in all, don‚Äôt think the food and service worth the money.",
