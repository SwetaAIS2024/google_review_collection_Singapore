Janson Yap,4,"Stayed here 2 years for my UTCP from 2020 to 2022. Room is fairly clean, common amenities (e.g., lifts, toilets, pantries, lounges) are well maintained. Located right in the heart of Utown means easy accessibility to a lot of facilities such as food courts, supermarket, gym and infinity pool. Nearest public bus stop runs buses 33 and 196 which connects to Buona Vista and Clementi stations.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118180444666458427544/reviews
Kristie Li,1,"Do not recommend it!!! The toilet seats look at least 20 years old! Very unhygienic! The meal plan is compulsory but definitely not worth it, especially if youâ€™re a meat eater! They even cut olives into quarters! Very stingy and very filthy.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105565034670270416585/reviews
Brett Kho,1,"disaster. Constantly things being stolen by security guards and there are fake cameras that don't even work. Bosses play ""favorites"" with who gets what and incredibly unfair to certain students.

Boris P,1,"Terrible place
They treat local students horribly and always give attention to foreign residents. Very discriminatory and breaking apart inside, despite all the fancy photos on their website, keep your kids elsewhere",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111877556733222515166/reviews
