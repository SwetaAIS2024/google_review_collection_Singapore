Ari Diraffe,1,"Iâ€™m sharing this to warn others and, hopefully, encourage Domino's to improve their service. I ordered three items, but when my delivery arrived, one item was missing. Instead, I received an empty box with only the baking paper inside clean and untouched. I wasnâ€™t aware I had ordered a box of air or invisible food!

What makes this even more frustrating is that this isnâ€™t the first time. This has happened multiple times on different occasions. I tried calling them, but no one answered. I hope this feedback reaches them because this kind of service is unacceptable, and customers deserve better.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113009884730893103885/reviews

Esther Loo,1,"I visited this outlet on 31.12.2024 @12.30 pm to place a walk-in order for a pizza and to collect on same day 5.30pm.
After i check the receipts, noticed a price discrepancy of $12.00 compared to the app price. When I brought this to the staff's attention @5.30pm, I was informed that walk-in and app prices differ. Consequently, my order was voided, and I was assured of a refund.
However, I was not provided any acknowledgment or receipt as proof of the voided transaction, despite requesting it. The staff mentioned they were busy and assured me the refund would be processed. As of now, I have left the outlet without the pizza, my money, or any documentation for the refund.
Considering this was a same-day transaction, the refund should typically reflect on my card immediately. I kindly request the management to verify this matter and ensure the refund is processed promptly. I appreciate your assistance in resolving this issue.
Thanks
As at 06.01.24, still no refund for the
Voided order, also no update for the refund status.
No one follow up, just need someone to update the status, very very disappointed with their service.

David Ethan,1,"Absolute horror. We ordered 2 hours ago for delivery and nothing showed up. We drove down and our orders were just sitting on the counter cold. The person did not even apologise and said they would make a new one in 20 minutes. 20 minutes, nothing happened. We left and bought other stuff out of frustration. Please DO NOT order from this outlet unless u don't mind the heartbreak. At the time of this review, we have yet to receive any order at all...after 4 hours !!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106591005602354578316/reviews
karho ong,5,"One of a kind experience, the staff working night shift on 15 May was very helpful, and tried their best to accommodate to my request. It was pleasant and heart warming to had the staff understanding my food decision and had the food prepared, ready in less than 10mins. Goodos to the night shift crew on 15 May. Hope the shop becomes better with more staffs like them! ps im not even exaggerating, the right staff does the right stuff! ðŸ˜Š",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109793363163884897802/reviews
