Mel G,5,"Our 2 boys (PN & K2) transferred to Brighton Montessori @ Hillview in December 2024, and we couldn't be more pleased with our choice.

The transition process, which often concerns parents, was handled expertly by the Brighton team. Both our boys adapted remarkably well to their new environment, a testament to the staff's warmth and experience in welcoming new students.

The school's physical environment is spacious and bright, with well-thought-out learning areas, clean and organised spaces, and purpose-designed activity zones.

What truly sets Brighton Montessori apart is their outstanding teaching team. Their loving and accommodating nature provides great reassurance to working parents like us. The teachers demonstrate genuine care and attention to each child's unique needs.

Communication with the team has been excellent, including comprehensive weekly updates, regular photo sharing through their app, parent-teacher meetings, and quick and helpful responses to our queries.

The curriculum weaves together structured learning and play-based activities, staying true to Montessori principles while incorporating creative and engaging elements. Educational experiences are thoughtfully planned and tailored to each child’s developmental stage.

The teachers' dedication is evident in the effort they put into creating engaging activities, which we can see through frequent app updates. Their commitment to documenting our children's learning journey helps us feel connected to their daily experiences.

We are incredibly thankful to have found Brighton Montessori @ Hillview. The warm, nurturing environment combined with their strong educational approach continues to exceed our expectations. We look forward to watching our boys grow and develop under the care of this dedicated team!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116473367637375494194/reviews
龄之之之,5,"Brighton Montessori has been an amazing experience for our family! My daughter started here at 18 months, and she has truly thrived. The teachers are incredibly caring and attentive, always creating a warm and nurturing environment for the little ones.

The Montessori approach has helped her develop independence and a genuine love for learning. It’s heartwarming to see her come home excited about the activities and eager to share what she’s learned.

The location at Hillview Community Club is fantastic, with the added bonus of a lovely playground on Level 4 that my daughter absolutely loves. It’s a great space for kids to explore and play safely.

We’re so grateful to have found such a wonderful preschool that truly feels like a second home for our daughter. Highly recommend Brighton Montessori to any parents looking for a loving and supportive start to their child’s education!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110879399952721658322/reviews
