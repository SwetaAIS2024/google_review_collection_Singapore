Matthew Lee,5,"Visited this new clinic for a checkup and it exceeded expectations. Dr Michael was patient, friendly and knowledgeable. I informed him that I was at risk of vasovagal syncope for the blood draw and he let me lie down for safety while talking me through the procedure. This really put me at ease and I did not have any anxiety whatsoever.

I especially appreciated the posters with transparent pricing and options around the clinic, which helped me to make an informed decision. Many other clinics have opaque pricing and checkup/treatment options; with AscendCare I did not feel awkward or unsure about choosing the best option for me with the doctor's advice.

The facilities were also clean and comfortable with friendly staff at the front desk. Highly recommended.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118287436279403003952/reviews
