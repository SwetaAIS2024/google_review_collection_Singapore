Thankfully, the queue move fast and it turned out to be a fantastic decision!\n\nWhat really caught my eye were their Vietnamese banana fritters - never seen them anywhere else. They did not disappoint! Crispy on the outside and filled with sweet, warm banana puree - pure deliciousness. Definitely going back for more of these!\n\nUpdate: they are closed every other Monday.",

I bought 5 items which was all squeezed & packed in one carrying plastic bag, I took a smaller carrying plastic bag in order to pick out one at a time to eat, but she told me she had to charge me $0.10 for the extra bag. If I were to buy the 5 items at 5 individual time, I would have the items all individually packed and she would have to waste 5 bags...",

Goes very well together with a hot beverage. I can eat this everyday for breakfast. The other fried fritters such as peanut sesame ball, poh piah and you tiao are pretty good too!",
