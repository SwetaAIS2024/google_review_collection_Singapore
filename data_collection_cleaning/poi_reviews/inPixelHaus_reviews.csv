Charles Ferguson,5,"More than a ""vendor""... Irman and inPixelHaus have become a partner to my business and a trusted advisor in design, visualisation, and brand communication. The patience, professionalism, and execution in our website and brand revamp project were second to none. The level of service and turn around time was beyond expectations and the design was simply perfect; he listened to everything I said and overdelivered. I can only say sincere thanks to him, and cannot recommend the services from inPixelHaus nighly enough!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107016715776253251011/reviews
Pam Pam,5,inPixelHaus created a beautiful website for us that has earned a lot of praises from our business partners and were very responsive to our enquiries and request. They are easy to work with and always willing to take the time to discuss our concern. I can't remember a problem not solved. Their knowledge and attention to detail have aided in keeping the development process smooth. Well done! We are 100% satisfied.,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105587744162928678330/reviews

Odie Maestro,5,"Great service rendered by inPixelHaus. Always listen to customer needs and give substantial advise to how we as a customer can optimise from the product offer by them. An exemplary entrepreneur whom I personally believe that put customer priorities first over personal gains. A definite must to engage them for a professional Website for a ridiculous price in the market.

Keep up the good job!!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115159381931176370371/reviews
Ricardo Lee,5,"If there are more than 5 stars I would gladly rate it. Top notch service at a reasonable price.
Website design is so much more than my ideal, I cannot emphasise how personalised and professional this company is.
Whenever I require any help, or have any requests, they are promptly being replied and actioned upon.
I would say, such promptness really spoil market, until now I am still engaging them for some of the updates on my website. You would imagine someone to do up your website nicely or not nicely and just leave you to it, but inPixelHaus goes ALL THE WAY!
I would TOTALLY recommend any one that I know or donâ€™t know, to go ahead and engage them.
Thank you for everything!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108817818690406605215/reviews
