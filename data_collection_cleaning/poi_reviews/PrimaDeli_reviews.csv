BABY GERM,5,"This is one of the best waffles in Singapore! Made fresh upon order, I tried it with peanut filling for just $2.10â€”a great combination.

However, it could be even better if they used crunchy peanut butter for added texture. The current peanut filling was a bit too watery for my liking",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112868994757778796482/reviews
Jyy Jyy,4,"Kaya waffle $2.1
Least sweet kaya I've had, similar to fairprice brand. Waffle is kinda cakey too, not the usual chewy ones.

Pandan Kaya slice $2.2
The sponge was kinda dry and the pandan layer was soggy. No pandan taste.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105036094348602076531/reviews
Richard Cheah,5,"One of my favourite outlets in Taman Jurong Shopping Centre.

Whenever I happened to be there, the sweet and nice aroma will quickly remind one of their existence. That's right! I am talking about their waffle.

If anyone has a crave for good and tasty waffle, this is the one outlet you can go for.

My whole family, including my 5 years old son simply loves the plain waffle. As for me, I will always go for the peanut waffle.

Don't be surprised when you happened to place an order, the queue formed earlier will make you wait for at least about 10 to 15 minutes for your order to be ready.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116759225490774107700/reviews
