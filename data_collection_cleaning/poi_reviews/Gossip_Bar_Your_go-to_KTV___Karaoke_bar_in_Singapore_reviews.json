It now has a pool table & is a lot more spacious.\n\nHave been here thrice and love the retro karaoke pub vibes and the bar grubs! Especially recommend the sotong balls & vegetarian rolls üòãüòã Couldn‚Äôt get enough of them ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nI like the easy to navigate song search system. Scan the QR code at your table and you have a long list of English, Chinese & Canto songs to choose from.\n\nHeard from the staff they have open mic Live Singing sessions on Thurs & Sat Nights. Would love to check them out in the future.\n\nGreat that their location is so accessible - It‚Äôs just a few min walk from Tai Seng MRT Station.",

The sound system is good, niche place with like 7 tables and doesn't need to wait too long for your turn.\nThey served Blanc, Guiness and KuroNama on Tap.\nDefinitely a gem in the area.\n\nThey live bands too on certain nights. Do head down if you are in the area.",
