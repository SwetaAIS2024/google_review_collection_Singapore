Joanne Cheng,4,"There is a community center just next to this eatery. It is open space and airy. There is a big fan and spacious seating area. There is multi-storey parking or can park along the roadside. We ordered curry fish head, and it was nice and spicy. The portion of food is enough for us. We have total of 5 adults and 2 children. The salted egg chicken dish is crispy. The tofu was soft, and outer is crispy. Overall, we like the food and often visit here. Cause my dad loves the spacious place and the parking.

There are mee stall if you want to have your own meal. The drink stall will be self-service. You can drop by if nearby for coffee and toast bread too.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110408957347137900620/reviews
Eugene Lee,1,"Regrettably, our highly anticipated family dinner at this establishment failed to meet our expectations. The black pepper beef was unacceptably tough, and the steamboat pomfret, priced at $57, consisted primarily of bones. The staff member's assertion that flat fish lack meat is demonstrably incorrect, as we have consistently ordered this dish elsewhere without encountering such an issue. Furthermore, it appeared that the fish was frozen and not fresh, and the soup had a sour taste, suggesting that the fish may have been spoiled. This disappointing experience precludes our return to this establishment, and we cannot recommend it to others.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104604604968762691113/reviews

LongEr,5,"One of the best neighborhood local Tze Char style.

From the crowd you’ll know how popular this cafe shop is. Diners just drive all the way here to order Tze Char. If you visit after 6pm, it normal to wait half a hour to get your dishes. So better visit Super early or Super later.

Cereal prawns is one of the best must try local dish. It’s also famous in Jumbo in tourist guide. The tiger prawn is big. Cereal is mixed with sugar and salt. The flavor is delectable for different ages.

Salted egg prawn is stunning. Actually all salted egg flavor dishes are awesome. The salty flavor is mixed with oily egg yolk which make diners keep salivating and sucking.

Tofu dishes are generally good. Minced tofu, sizzling tofu and homemade tofu are all nice to order. This cafe shop can be daily canteen.

Google is much better than TA. This rest doesn’t have in TripAdvisor.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107257477085501290498/reviews
