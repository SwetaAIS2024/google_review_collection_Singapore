JL,5,Liked they provide brown rice. Dishes are healthy and not oily (even the pork chop is not oily). Highly Recommended for those looking for healthy mixed veg brown rice in this neighbourhood!,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111923653431439408688/reviews
Darren Cheong,2,"I ordered the kungpao chicken.. the chicken taste like frozen chicken...

Portion not okay.. 2 vege and 1 meat.. $4sgd

The stall managed by a couple.. so the service very slow...

I would say healthy dishes but not that yummy.. maybe elderly like it because healthy dishes means not yummy food..",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136407063098297690/reviews

Lawrence Teo,1,"My boy bought rice with 2 prawns, sweet & sour pork and cabbage. Stall charged him $5.30. Explained that prawn cost $1 each while 1 meat & 1 veg is $3.30. Totally dishonest!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113265821392349431707/reviews
