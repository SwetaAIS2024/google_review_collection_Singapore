Saveendra Ekanayake,5,"I recently visited the Caribbean Juice Bar, and it was a delightful escape from the city’s hustle. Located by the harbour, the bar offers a tranquil atmosphere with a beautiful view of the water and lush greenery. The wooden rustic decor perfectly complements the laid-back, tropical vibe, making it an ideal spot to unwind.

The drinks were a highlight of the experience. I tried two of their refreshing beverages, each served in a stylish glass with metal straws, which added an eco-friendly touch. One drink was a vibrant red juice garnished with an orange slice, bursting with tropical flavors, while the other was a refreshing watermelon cooler with a hint of lime. Both drinks were chilled to perfection and tasted incredibly fresh.

Sipping on these flavorful drinks while enjoying the river view made for a perfect afternoon. The combination of great drinks, scenic surroundings, and cozy seating makes the Caribbean Juice Bar a must-visit spot for anyone looking to relax with a cool drink in hand.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112485216419568676213/reviews
YT,5,"I came across this juice bar in Johor Bahru on TikTok, and I’m so glad I decided to check it out. Apparently, all their desserts are vegan-friendly (not entirely sure, but we gave it a try). The cake was really, really good, and the chocolate milkshake was exceptional. The watermelon juice was sweet and refreshing.

We sat on the upper deck, which faces the sea. There were no issues with flies, and the place was clean. We even caught the sunset, which added to the beautiful experience.

For the price, the food, and the stunning view, this place is definitely a steal.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116335289933602715039/reviews
