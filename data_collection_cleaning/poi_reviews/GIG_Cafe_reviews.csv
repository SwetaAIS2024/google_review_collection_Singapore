miko goh,5,"At first, I felt that the staff were not very friendly. However, later, a lady who seemed to be the lady boss approached me and kindly offered to move us to an indoor table, as we were seated near the door and our baby might feel hot. She even helped carry all my belongings to the new table, allowing me to focus on carrying my daughter while my husband was placing our order at the counter. She was truly kind and thoughtful. Additionally, she provided a new set of baby cutlery after my daughter accidentally dropped her plate on the floor.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103049887510487604862/reviews

Lynn Lim,4,"A very nice and cozy café tucked away in the heart of Tampines, nestled in the HDB heartlands. The place has a warm, inviting vibe with a peaceful atmosphere. The staff were friendly and attentive, adding to the positive experience. I ordered a café latte, lemon chrysanthemum flower tea, and the tomato seafood stew. The stew was wonderfully flavorful, the tea was refreshing, and the coffee was decent.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118375945530929131414/reviews
