Hashvini Rekha Pachappan,2,"Dr. Celyn seems to know what she is doing but session was rushed. I was given a diagnosis but it doesn’t require medication. This costed me RM460. There are other places with better service and cheaper price than this. And I had a 3pm appointment to which I was punctual. Because their reminders mentioned any delay more than 15 mins my appointment will be cancelled and in future I won’t be able to make appointments too. But when I was punctual, they made me wait until 4pm . Only when I reminded the counter staff, the doctor called me in. Speak about punctuality, rushing the session and charging RM460. For a referral letter for any further treatment outside they charge RM80.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117399357511603242280/reviews
