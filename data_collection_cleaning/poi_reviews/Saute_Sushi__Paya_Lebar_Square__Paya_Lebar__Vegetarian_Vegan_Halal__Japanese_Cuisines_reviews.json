Every time when I visit Saute Sushi, it is nearly full, and every time I will definite enjoy my favourites : chawanmushi and the fried mushroom.\nI am very comfortable with their service.",

Especially Adeline, she noticed that I was about to finish my food and served a couple of napkins! I also noticed her serving other customers with more in depth service than usual. For example, the customer asked for hot water, she asked if they wanted warm or hot, n they preferred it warm. But the menu only had hot so she went the extra step to give them warm water.",

We were in awe of the vegetarian unagi roll and the truffle soup ramen - so amazingly delicious. Food gets delivered on a train so it‚Äôs somewhat entertaining.\n\nService is a little inconsistent - staff can be quite friendly and polite, but napkins aren‚Äôt always provided. So the little things made it a 4 instead of 5 for service.\n\n$54 for membership gets you $70 worth of vouchers - not a bad deal.",
