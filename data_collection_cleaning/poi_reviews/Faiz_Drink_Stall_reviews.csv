Jason Aw,1,"So this happened today: I ordered 2 teh halia for $2.80 and the 2 guys tending the stall claim that they didn’t have change for $10 so they gave me 20 cents and said that they will give me the rest of my change later. Wife and I both felt that the drinks were flavourless. My wife couldn’t even bring herself to finish her drink. I don’t like wasting food so I finished my wife’s drink after I was done with mine. When I was done with both drinks (and I was drinking at a leisurely pace), my change still hadn’t come despite a number of customers buying drinks from this stall after me (so, they should have had change by this time, right?). I had to leave the hawker centre already so I went up to the stall assistant and requested for my change. The guy turned very aggressive, claiming not to know anything about my change as he had just arrived at the stall (I recognised him as the guy who prepared my drinks so I’m pretty sure it was a lie). At this time, the other guy (who was off delivering drinks to other patrons) returned to the stall and intervened, asking me how much change I was owed. I got my $7 in change and left.

Tldr; drinks stall accepts money from customer, claims not to have change for $10, and then totally forgets to give change to customer.

Moral of the story: (1) teh halia from this stall is weak sauce, (2) if you buy drinks from them, best to pay with exact change (they might forget about your change and if you also forget, then you’ve just spent $10 for 2 really thin cups of teh halia).",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104063920916479728083/reviews
