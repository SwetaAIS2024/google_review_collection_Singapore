Crypto ExDee,5,"Extremely beautiful park in a landed district area that has all your needs in one place and largely cater to the Seletar Hills small population.

The park isn‚Äôt big but it definitely has all the essential facilities and amenities from 3G fitness corner, to community garden, a children‚Äôs playground, basketball court and even old IPPT stations. There are swings available as well.

Plenty of benches are available for you to sit, rest, chill and enjoy nature.

One round on the footpath track is 290m long.

There are bicycle stations for you to park your bicycle as well.

There are a few restaurants and a coffee shop just beside the park so you could grab a quick meal there.

This place may be a little crowded during evenings.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110697649280498996686/reviews
Jonathan Wan,5,Nice playground with a adequately maintain footpath ring that you can do some running/walking around.
