Chan Michelle,5,Accurate diagnosis of my car cooling coil leak as i topped up few times air con gas and recommended to replace it at a reasonable price. They have a digital machine to check the coil for leak which is more accurate than manual gauges. Staff also gave clear explanation how the cooling fan work.  Able to collect car on the same day and air con is super cold after replacement. Also replaced my rear camera which was blurred. Staff are all polite and helpful. Happy customer and would recommend!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110093961403397883352/reviews

Jeff,5,Superb service. Responsible and reliable. The owner Alex will not try to upsell but will recommend you something that’s good and within your budget without compromising quality. I did up my car there recently and their service was awesome and their workmanship was meticulous. My car was new and I had some accessories that I needed to install. Alex and his crew automatically installed the accessories without me notifying them. They will treat your car they way they would treat their own. I have nothing but good things to say about Alex and his crew.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101763540896756605183/reviews
