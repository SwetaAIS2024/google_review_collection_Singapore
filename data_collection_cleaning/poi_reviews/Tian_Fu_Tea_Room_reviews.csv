Glen Ho,1,Came for a kunfu tea experience. But I get this instead. $16.80 for the teapot on the right. Da Hong pao. And $9 for the teapot on the left. Why did I even bother.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107812143249024383976/reviews
Bryan Klein,5,They took the time to sit with me and explain the brewing process and some of the history and culture of tea. It was very generous and I really appreciated it all. They exceeded every hope I had when I came here to visit.,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109585843785338848804/reviews
katsutakeatsu,4,"I wasn't sure what the famous restaurant was because I was taken there, but I ate some dim sum.
It was pretty good. A staff member who specializes in tea pours tea for customers using a long-tipped teapot (?I don't think so?). It seems like you can get a second helping as well. I'd like to say that it's an outstanding technique and doesn't spill a single drop, but you have to be careful as hot water sometimes splashes out (lol).
Because the prices are high... Maybe there are cheaper and better options in Chinatown?",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107456886370114284710/reviews
