      "text": "Dr Lai is very knowledgeable in his field and supportive towards organic birth. His routine check for baby developments is very thorough if you like prolonged ultrasound frequently. He follows through mummies' preferences. My husband love that this clinic is punctual on appointments. Basically just 10min wait each time. Charges is on the higher end.\n\nOn the other hand. Sri, the clinic staff is terrible at communication and insensitive. It felt like she doesnt care about patient but just wanted to finish her SOP and end the day. When I just discharged from hospital on a wheelchair, she insisted that I must rush down in 30min to see doc upon a call (we rushed down, my car journey to the clinic alone is 30min and we later found out that she had atleast 2hr margin). To make it more painful Sri made me walk around unnecessarily when I arrived to complete each of her SOPs thats not important for a woman in pain such as measuring weight and giving routine vax but split it into multiple trips at different ends of the clinic. I was so afraid that i need to go to hospital again because of my condition. Sri just doesn't care.\n\nSri measures all your data without telling you whats the results. She gives medicine & vax without telling patient the instructions or side effects. Very often her info differ from the doctor's instructions which is confusing. I always had to double check with clinic. However, Regina is very helpful and she usually steps in for Sri if needed. I recommend Regina to look at bare minimum patient experience that her staff is providing under such a reputable OBGYN clinic.",

      "text": "I am so deeply grateful for Dr Lai’s support and care throughout my pregnancy and delivery of my son just this week.\n\nIn the initial stages of my pregnancy, I had some signs of potential miscarriage & Dr Lai was kind, practical and honest with me about navigating the situation with clear choices; and fortunately my pregnancy continued. This was a stark contrast to another OB I consulted who pressured me with interventions with significant cost and limited evidence of support.\n\nI had chosen to have a natural birth at Four Trimesters with minimal intervention and support from doulas through my labour. My birth didn’t entirely go to plan, though Dr Lai and the doula team helped me achieve a natural, drug free delivery at the sanctuary that I am thrilled with nevertheless. Dr Lai was very calm, reassuring, consistently consulting with me, reminding me of my original birth plan and giving me choices, so I still felt like an active participant in and owner of my birth experience. The doula team and Dr Lai worked really well together and with me to help me achieve the outcome I desired for me and for my son.\n\nDr Lai made me feel reassured, respected and heard throughout my pregnancy and delivery; and ultimately empowered and confident about my mamahood journey. Staying on at 4T afterwards was wonderful in creating a gentle and nourishing atmosphere for my son and I to heal, bond and settle into life together.\n\nI would very highly recommend the care of Dr Lai & A Company For Women as well as Four Trimesters for any mama who wishes to have an empowered birth experience, in hospital or at the birth sanctuary. I certainly see why women choose to travel internationally for this experience. Thank you so much to Dr Lai and the 4T team for enabling such a precious experience to be safe and truly magical.",

This was by far the best experience in my life.\n\nI can only hope to have the pleasure to have doctor Lai as my obgyn again. He offered my the choice to birth with freedom, a choice many women don’t have here in Asia.",
