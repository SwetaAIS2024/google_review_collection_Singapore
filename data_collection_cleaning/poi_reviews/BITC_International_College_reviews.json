      "text": "SUPER LOUSY SCHOOL WITH LAZY IRRESPONSIBLE STAFF\nFIRSTLY, NOBODY TOLD ME THE COURSE DETAILS OR CONTACTED ME OR GIVE ME ADDRESS AFTER I SIGNED UP AND PAID. Then blamed me on first lesson for not wearing covered shoes.\n\nThen on 3rd lesson right now, I am so enraged writing this review halfway through my Advanced Peranakan ASSESSMENT DAY on 7 Jan 2024 at 3.15pm. HOW CAN SIMPLE THINGS LIKE SESAME OIL BE OUT OF STOCK WHEN IT IS REQUIRED ON MY ASSESSMENT DAY? I have to storm to office to scold people and everyone is so laid back. How can ingredients be used up and not be stocked at all? Super NOT WELL EQUIPPED, dirty, no system and the class can even be like 1-2 students. Shows how bad their planning is! WORST SCHOOL I EVER I HAVE EVER ATTENDED COMPARED TO ABC BAKING STUDIO AND BELLS!",
