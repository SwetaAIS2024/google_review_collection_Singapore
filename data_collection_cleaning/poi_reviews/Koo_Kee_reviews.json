Gravy could be more tasty and a little watery. Ngo heong if heated up better. Taste ok. Their rice dish is actually quite good. Tasty meat, rice was well done.\nI don't really like the Thai ice tea. Colour looks a little off and taste too. Not as authentic but ok lah. This is not a Thai stall:)\nOverall, a 4 star experience.",

(Like, I already ordered and paid and waited, what’s the alternative?)\n\nThink they should have prioritised and started steaming early if they know it’s going to take more time\n\nEdit: at 740 it still wasn’t ready (they said 4 more min but I’m not sure I trust that estimate) and I asked for a refund.\n\nThey were apologetic but i think they should review their work processes",
