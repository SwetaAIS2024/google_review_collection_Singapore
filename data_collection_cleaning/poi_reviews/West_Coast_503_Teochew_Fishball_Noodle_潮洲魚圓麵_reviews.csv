Zhixiang Chee Siong,5,My favourite noodle stall around! Never get sick of eating it again and again. Atmosphere is not as ideal but can't really blame it on the stall since it's located within a coffee shop.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101494858664707763825/reviews
Eric Wong,5,Visited on 14 Mar 2023 for lunch and the store doesn't disappoint.. I ordered the teochew fishball meepok and 3 fish cakes. The soup that the fishball were in was deeply flavoured.. the fishballs were those that has chopped chilli and chives mixed into it. The chilli meepok is very tasty and tangy to the bite. The fishcake was very bouncy and is icing on the meal.. the long queue was very much well worth it ðŸ‘Œ,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117691308830861443080/reviews
Joe P,4,"Had the fishball and minced meat noodle ($3.30) and it was a very satisfactory meal. The 4 large fishballs are not the run-of-the-mill generic type - it had  tiny bits of chilli and scallions embedded in it.
They said they're open early until 7.30pm daily with no fixed off days.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109325409107438635368/reviews
