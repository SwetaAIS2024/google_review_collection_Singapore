Elijah Tan,4,"We visited P.S. Cafe at MBS to celebrate Christmas early after a lovely time at Winter Wonderland, and it was a great choice to celebrate the festive occasion. Thankfully, we had called ahead for a reservation, as the restaurant was packed.

The pasta dishes we ordered were decent, with generous portions that were perfect for sharing. However, the highlight of our meal was undoubtedly the truffle fries‚Äîsimply delicious and worth every bite!

The service was alright. Nothing much to say about. The overall experience was enjoyable, and we left feeling satisfied.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109287346354369266778/reviews
Angeline Tjandra,5,"Been a patron of PS Cafe and finally visited the MBS branch.

Had my usual favourites: truffle fries, king prawn aglio olio and sticky bbq ribs. Also ordered junior spaghetti bolognese for my daughter.

Truffle fries - great starter to share, with fragrant truffle oil and shoestring cheese
King prawn aglio olio - pasta was cooked well, herbs are fragrant, the toasted breadcrumbs gave nice texture
Sticky bbq ribs - finger licking good!
Spaghetti bolognese - well balanced bolognese sauce, can taste the meat and not too sour unlike some other places

The dining place has nice atmosphere.

Special shoutout to Hergesh for the great service :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105376742778053414108/reviews
N T,4,"Cauliflower gratin - 3 stars
Cheesy, could use a bit of salt.

Barramundi risotto - 3.5 stars
Had this a few years back at Dempsey and that was better. The fish was moist and spicy but could use more salt - I usually like things less salty so was surprised.

Roast chicken - 3.5 stars

Red velvet cake ($16) - 4.5 stars
Was sceptical when I heard they stopped making their cakes in house 4-5 years ago, and get their cakes delivered from a central kitchen every week but this was moist, had good chocolate flavour and wasn't too sweet. I'm a fan! It's definitely pricey though.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103165559486640653412/reviews

JAO JAO,5,"PS.Cafe at Marina Bay Sands offers a delightful dining experience with a relaxed yet elegant atmosphere. The environment is beautifully designed and kids friendly, perfect for a family outing. The service is prompt, and the staff are attentive, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable meal.

We tried the roast crispy chicken, which was tender, juicy, and flavorful, paired perfectly with a rich garlic bread sauce. The French toast was a standout‚Äîsoft and fluffy with a caramelized exterior, complemented by a sweet caramel sauce. For our little one, we ordered the kids' cheeseburger meal, which came with a generous serving of fries. The burger was well-prepared, with a juicy Angus patty and melted cheddar cheese.

Overall, the combination of delicious food, great service, and a serene environment makes PS.Cafe a must-visit at Marina Bay Sands.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101237592496501407589/reviews
