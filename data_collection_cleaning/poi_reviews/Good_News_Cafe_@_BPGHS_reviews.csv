Zachary Chua,3,"Nice place to eat at if you're from the school and want a quick bite. The service is rather fast as well so that's a plus. If you want to avoid the canteen crowd and have a quick meal, this place is for you. The food quality isn't very good though.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116465865951212263673/reviews
