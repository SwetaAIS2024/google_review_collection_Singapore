Benjamin Yong,5,"A taste of my childhood. My mum told me they've been patronising the store since I was in her stomach. Noodles are OK, but what's truly fantastic are their handmade Teochew fish balls and Teochew Har Giao, which is both flavourful and chewy. I like how chewy their Har Giao are and the owners said extra time is taken to ensure it's chewyness. Regulars continue to patronise this stall, which recently reopened. Hopeful to continue patronising this stall if possible!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112734674285643560833/reviews
Kenneth Lee,1,Very rude stallholders. Food not that nice either would avoid at all course. The other two fishball stalls serve much better food,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111922348739571682699/reviews
Kok Yeng Lim,4,"Fish dumplings is firm and chewy, filled with meat mince, it is very unique. Fishball is soft and very tender, quite tasty too. The noodles serving is slightly small for most adult. Do opt for upsize if you have a big appetite. The stall owner is the pioneer of Karenâ€™s diner. Do expect some attitude from him if you are first time visiting this stall. ðŸ˜‘",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107366980102710903664/reviews
Sean Goh,3,"Heard alot about this stall over at Toa Payoh west Hawker centre that sells shredded chicken noodle. I was quite lucky as I managed to buy the last bowl of the day before they call it a day.

Apperantly they are famous for their handmade fish dumpling. A bowl of noodle starts from SGD$3 onwards, i had the shredded chicken fish dumpling noodle which was SGD$4.

Noodle was nicely cooked and texture was springy. The sauce could be more savoury. Quite unique to have shredded chicken instead of the usual minced pork. The fish dumpling is indeed special and different from the one you commonly find outside

Overall, its was a average bowl of noodle, nothing special that I would come all the way just to eat.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
PY,4,"Handmade fish dumplings and fishballs were great! Minced meat came in the piping hot soup base! Love the chewy mee pok in vinegary sauce, mixed with shredded chicken and mushrooms",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101942741229132110086/reviews
