Irfan Maliq,5,"I was a BGPS Student since 2018. The teachers are kind. All my friend are awesome. The development of the buildings is very modern. They now added ramps for wheelchair at Gate 5 and School Hall, making it accessible. I love BGPS! :D",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115129371211029342618/reviews
Clarkinite,4,As an alumni of bgps i would like to say that i had a great experience but now looking at my juniors i realised that they did not like my batch of p6s at all as we did not have this many opportunitys to go on feild trips and have interactive lessons as the newer p5-p6s do but i can say that this is an amazing schools with amazing teachers that taught me how to grow as a person but the new disipline master is quite terrifying to this day,12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111299037924542377041/reviews
DAFAKE KREEKCRAFT,2,".The school is ok but why can't students go to stores after school to buy food? And why can't we eat just one step out of the canteen? Or at other tables? It's not like students are not allowed to go there. Seriously. Also why can't we just have fun at times. We can't even cheer for the people performing when there is a performance? Literally must be dead silent. It's a literal performance. Can i not have fun. The new discipline master also said that there is no excuse to be late for school??? What if theres a traffic jam. It's not my fault if there is a traffic jam and i can't do anything about it. My mother think's this rules are not that great too. As a sec 1, I feel this rules should be fixed and teachers should not scold students for invalid reasons.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104864471841650293906/reviews
