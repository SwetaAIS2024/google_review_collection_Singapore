      "text": "So, we ventured to Clusia Cove at Jurong Lake Gardens, enticed by the idea of a free water playground. The concept is fantastic‚Äîtidal pools, sand play, and a naturalistic setting that mimics coastal shores.  The water is shallow and clean, thanks to an eco-friendly treatment system involving sand beds and UV purification.  Ôøº Ôøº\n\nBut here‚Äôs the catch: shade is practically nonexistent. Despite being surrounded by trees, the water play area lacks adequate cover, making it feel like you‚Äôre wading in a sunlit skillet.  There‚Äôs a shaded area near the toilets, but it‚Äôs not sufficient for the entire playground. Ôøº\n\nOn the bright side, the bathroom and shower facilities are clean and well-maintained‚Äîstandard for Singapore.  Ôøº\n\nFinal thoughts: Clusia Cove has great potential, but the lack of shade is a significant drawback. Consider visiting in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid the peak sun.  Ôøº",
