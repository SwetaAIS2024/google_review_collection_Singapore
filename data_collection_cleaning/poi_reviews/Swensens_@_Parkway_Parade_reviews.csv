Liza Bakar,5,"My family and I love the food, and Parkway Parade outlet is our favourite. We usually try their specials and this Chinese New Year was no exception. The gold bar dessert was such a novelty, and it was fun cracking into it.

It was delicious, and worth the extra premium as we were creating memories.

The staff there were wonderful as usual and food arrived quickly despite how busy they were.

Thank you, Swensens Team!!!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112510100586618079470/reviews
Darren Foo,3,"Food was good, service was decent, but it took 50 mins for the mains to comeâ€¦ which was unacceptable.

This branch is short-staffed - pity the staff as they were running non stop and getting complaints from most tables",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100521246943401452556/reviews
J Ou,5,"We ordered the pasta carbonara and ultra burger. The food was good. Fries were crispy. Service is good. They have students promotions for less than $20, comes with drink or soup, can add a scoop of ice cream for $2.50. We will come back.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104528985003715532586/reviews
Lydia Tan,2,Disappointed with Swensen parkway Nutty Mighty ice cream served on 12.5.25  - waffles with nuts are soft and not chrispy : hardly any nuts in the ice cream. The macadamia nuts are rancid and has the stale taste,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105258766403885761713/reviews
Angelin,4,"We always love their classic vanilla crunchy cone and now I got to try their fried chicken ice cream. I really loved the crunchiness of the outer layer, it was such a good topping to the ice cream. I also appreciate how realistic it looks! My dad tried the brownie but he thinks it's way too sweet, especially with the marshmallow drizzle. Service was too slow.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105417076759937799330/reviews
