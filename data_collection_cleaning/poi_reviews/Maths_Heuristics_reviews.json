Under Kevin’s guidance, my child’s grades improved from an AL3 in math to achieving consistent AL1 grades in both Primary 5, 6, and the PSLE\n\nKevin is an exceptional teacher who is patient, skilled, and genuinely invested in his students’ success. His clear explanations and consistent guidance have helped my child gain a much stronger grasp of math concepts and build confidence in solving complex problems.\n\nWe are thankful for Kevin’s unwavering support over the years.",

      "text": "I signed up my child for the tuition with Tr Kevin given the online review, but on an online basis.  My child was totally neglected for 4 months. He wasn't engaged , the teacher didn't know what my child was up to in each class but had never reached out to work through on how to engage him. 16 lessons later I found out my child was just copying answers from the screen. Utterly gutted and disappointed.  It's 4 months in his psle year , big mistake. The centre asked for feedback and just filed it away.",

We as parents own the responsibility for our child. But Mr Huang helps it a lot. He is also readily available for help too.\n\nMy son got AL1 for his Maths in PSLE. It was a brilliant happiness and I attribute it to Kevin and his teaching methods and his hard work in providing lots of solutions to past year papers.",

      "text": "Mr Kevin Huang is a very patient and dedicated teacher who guided us through the whole process of having the P3 Class purely online. He introduced to us the different tools so that he can effectively monitor my daughter's progress via her ipad at the comfort of our own home as distance was in issue. I was first worried if my daughter would be shortchanged as she is not in the physical class but certainly not at all. Mr Kevin could still engage her in the lesson by making her answer questions during the lesson together with the other students in the physical class which i think can be quite challenging but Mr Kevin did it seamlessly. My daughter also started to have more confidence to want to try heuristics questions in school too. Thank you Mr Kevin and Maths Heuristics!",
