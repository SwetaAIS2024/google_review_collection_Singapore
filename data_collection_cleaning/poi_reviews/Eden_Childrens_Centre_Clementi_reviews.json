The children who have grown & graduated from here are the real-life examples of the dedication, love & work that the staff put in daily. Not enough recognition is given to special education providers; and what it takes to pour their lives into our children, all the while holding their hands as they grow. They work tirelessly behind the scenes for our kids' welfare. Our family has been very blessed. Thank you & awesome job Eden (Clementi)!",
