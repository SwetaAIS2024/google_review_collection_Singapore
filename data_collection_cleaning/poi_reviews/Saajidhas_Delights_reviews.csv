Ainnie Tey,5,"A classic combination that brings together the fragrant richness of briyani with the fiery kick of ayam sambal. This dish is a powerhouse of flavors. The meal is made even better by the warm and friendly service. The staff is attentive, always ready with recommendations and a smile, making the dining experience feel welcoming and personal. Whether it's ensuring the sambal is just the right level of spicy or offering extra sides, their hospitality adds to the enjoyment.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113046146623172340915/reviews
Darren Cheong,4,"The briyani rice was almost perfect..

The Mutton, ar char (salad) and sauces are superb...

The Mutton was in a big chunk, then she/he use the scissor to cut into small sizes.. its very tender and boneless..

The sauces very rich with Mutton flavour. I love it. The spices and masala just nicee not too heavy..

The chicken taste ok ok..

The briyani rice was not the best in my dictionary..

The roti prata is good.. the key is the Mutton sauce.. yumyum $2.20sgd (2pcs)

$7.50sgd for Mutton briyani.. satisfaction above average..

$7 SGD chicken briyani..

$6SGD Mutton + white rice.. Mutton GOOD",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136407063098297690/reviews

Xenoempathy,1,Came for breakfast. Prata was decent. What really gets to me was the fact that the server wants to charge me $0.30 an extra plate and I am not talking about a takeaway container. Lol. Not coming back here for this kind of service. There are soooooo many other food options available here.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101447531694692415542/reviews
