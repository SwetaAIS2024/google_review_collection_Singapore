Kim Long Wong,4,"The best place to gather for friends and family. The service attendance was so helpful and explained that there are so many details, especially the sugar levels. Also, the taste of the cake is such a great taste. The 2nd level is the area to enjoy the best environment in this shop. You can view all the shops within this area. Besides that, there are plenty of seats at the balcony that make you feel better or have a great life in this moment.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113164696041785989339/reviews
