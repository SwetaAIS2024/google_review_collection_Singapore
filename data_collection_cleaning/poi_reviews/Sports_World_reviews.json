Excellent customer service and they all are very good about this product knowledge.\nI visit many shops in Queensway shopping centre but they don't give the correct shoes for the customer just only ask the shoe size and give, but here they recommend the correct shoe either flat or arch foot. Thanks for your service guys.",
