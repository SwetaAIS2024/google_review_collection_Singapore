Anikaz Travel,3,"Good coffee for a better price but no sitting place and can get very crowded.
The coffee is pretty strong over here and if you go for an afternoon coffee this place wonâ€™t be crowded. But if you visit this place for breakfast you canâ€™t even step foot into this.
The concept of this place uses and open kitchen which can be troublesome as you need to serve the people and the only seating place is outside. Other than the seating problem this place is good and has a lot of good treats and coffee.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100371975357068365869/reviews
