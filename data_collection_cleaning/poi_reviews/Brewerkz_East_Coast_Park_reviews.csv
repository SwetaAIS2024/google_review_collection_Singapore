Maisie Lim,5,"Food was amazing, service staff very friendly and attentive. Great place to grab a bite or a beer. Fish and chips was amazing, very value for money considering the quality of food. Was a thick cut of fish with a very light crispy batter.

Only downside to this place is that its not a fully air-conditioned place, but its well ventilated with tons of fans around. You get alfresco dining and enjoy nature and people watching.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108467420716576542108/reviews
Brian Dobbyn,5,"Woohoo what a find so glad we hunted out East Coast Park across from the The Mecure Grand Roxy, service excellence from both Jeeven and Jhon 101 hospitality delivering 10/10  service, in a wonderful location.
Now let's talk beer as a brewer myself these beers are truly delicious.  We have booked a table for our return in 2 weeks time.

Tracy Yeo,5,"My 2nd time here within the same week. I love the atmosphere there , near to the beach and also plenty of parking lots and most importantly; pet friendly!  I brought my 2 furkids here while dinning but last few days was here with a customer for lunch.  The Pepperoni Pizza is superb and the Buttermilk Chicken and Pancakes is delicious too.  I am not so much of a beer person but the Golden Ale is smooth and easy to drink.  Sitting outdoor will be recommended as it is quite breezy and there are many ceiling fans installed. Will come back to try other dishes and pizzas soon, food selection is quite good as well as the beer selection.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117317539897562874177/reviews
Pun Eunice & Dave,1,"I had high hopes for Brewerkz East Coast Park, given its nice atmosphere, but unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. While the ambiance is pleasant, the food was just okay. I specifically found the kids' meal to be not worth ordering; it was underwhelming and definitely not worth the wait. Speaking of wait, we ended up waiting an hour for our food to be served, which is far too long for a casual dining experience. Overall, I was left frustrated and won't be returning anytime soon.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102969324286807883876/reviews
Fauzi Mohd,5,"When for a pet fair and we end up having early dinner here. Seem like every F&B joint here is pet friendly so that a plus ++. The food we ordered Sausage Platter & hot wings were really good. And the new beer selection the have is really good, better than the last. Well done Mitch ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103869021987530566277/reviews
