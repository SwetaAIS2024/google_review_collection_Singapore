      "text": "Food was OK I would say. Since it’s a new stall it has a lot of hype but the queue is getting shorter everyday.\nPartly because the food is not like the GOAT, but it’s decent. I personally would recommend 卤肉饭 Braised Pork Rice (includes sliced braised pork with half braised egg and some salted vegetables).\nAnd also DO NOT buy the tea bag egg, $1.20 for an egg that doesn’t taste different from any other egg and you have the peel the shell yourself.\n\nThe service I would give 5 star in this canteen as this is the only stall that gives out collection buzzer (the one that will buzz when your food is ready to collect) and detailed receipts",
