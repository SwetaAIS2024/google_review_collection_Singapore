      "text": "Recently 2 Mar 2025, a newly renovated section 2nd floor in the Jelita Mall Jelita Gourmet foodcourd is opened. Good size and good variety of food stalls there. There are Ah Ma Bakchor noodle, Ipoh Tuck Kee zhi char, western grill stall, roasted meat noodle,  prawn noodle, prata, briyani, drink stall with beer that open till midnight, gelato economic rice and etc.\n\nWe tried the steam fish and fried kang kong for 2 person and ordered the yifu noodle and fried beetaimak for another 2 person from the Ipoh Tuck Kee zhi char. Due to promo, came with a free boil octopus dish as well. All tasted delicious and with decent prices. We have gotten the chocolate tissue prata and gelato for dessert to complete the dinner there. It was an enjoyable meal.\n\nOverall, it was a good addition to the mall as there was no foodcourt near this area and will be a good pit stop for those who cycle or walk along the Railway corridor.",
