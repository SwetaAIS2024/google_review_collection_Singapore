For a condition that a highly raved urologist previously deemed as “no other solution for me”, Dr Quek managed to reassess my condition and offered me different perspectives. She patiently analysed my 2 full pages of medical journal on our first consultation and treated me accordingly based on her initial prognosis since then. I feel very much at ease under her care. Really thankful to have found her and that truly gave me hope towards the road to recovery. Wish we have met earlier to save me from the agony.",
