Randy Ngatimin,4,"Food is good, service is impeccable too. Staff was very accommodating for our large group and even allow us to bring our own cake to celebrate our friend’s b’day, providing us with plates and utensils. The impossible mushroom Swiss burger is not bad, mushroom wedges are nicely fried. Fries are also perfectly fried. 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107076346774947547605/reviews
Abby Ng,4,"A place suitable for family gatherings, dates or social hangouts, enchanting both indoors and out. Comments from our table;: food portion is good for sharing; food quality surprisingly good. Shout out to Mok together with Gary and team did a great job attending to us.  (Didn’t take the rest of food pics as we arrived separately.) drinks were $9 per glass. Can try Vietnamese chicken chop. Mushroom pizza was good too!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107988237520328990049/reviews

Justine Thyme,5,Kudos to the staff for perfect meal recommendations. My elderly guest really enjoyed the Chicken rice! The team was also quick to help when the sudden downpour came and groups of outdoor diners had to move to tables to avoid the pelting rain. Ms R and the blond male wait staff (sorry didn’t get your names but you were so kind to elderly diners❤️) managed the lunch crowd so well and gave my guest a birthday cake surprise too! We had a great time thanks to both of you!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101356046755798757674/reviews
Deric Soh,4,Food was OK. Penne was a bit hard. If it was boiled for another minute or so it'd be al dente.  Meatballs stuck together. But it was cooked. Pizza Margareta was good but don't put the basil leaves in to bake. Put it in 30 sec before it's ready. 1 leaf per slice would be nice presentation.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101392722722790392221/reviews
