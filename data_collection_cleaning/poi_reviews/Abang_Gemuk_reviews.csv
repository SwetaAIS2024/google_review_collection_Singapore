Nissan Skyline GTR32,5,"I just ate here on 5 Jan 2025, Sunday 9pm, young Malay chap was working/cooking solo. The food was fresh and delicious, very generous portions.

I ordered Fish and Chips, the fries were hot and crispy, the fish was huge (bigger than my open palm, and there was 2pcs), tasty and well seasoned and the bun was fluffy and airy. The Coleslaw was just normal, yummy, but nothing special. Paid $8.90 only.

Not sure why there are many low reviews of the place. Maybe due to consistency of different staff working?

Service - Itâ€™s a coffee shop. You order, pay, and collect your food. Nothing much to it, the staff was pleasant enough.

Atmosphere - Again, itâ€™s a regular coffee shop, nothing special.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107149001770266702858/reviews
julian lee,1,"Terrible food. Fries and onion rings were so hard, too overly fried. Got the steak and it was so hard and dry as if i was cutting a dried up clay block with a plastic spatula, when ordering the guy working did not even ask for how done i want my steak to be. Super inflexible, could only change coleslaw to mash potato and nothing else. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST OR ELSE YOU WILL REGRET!!!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100373474945793638295/reviews

Benjamin Alexander Chua,1,"I seldom make such a harsh review because I know small businesses has to survive but this is really quite bad. The chicken is fried until it is quite tarred and overly salty. Furthermore, this cost $30.50 for nine pieces of chicken.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115630886107474621464/reviews
Momochi,1,"Tried twice and both time the chicken was over-cooked, dried hard not fresh.. Don't try unless you have no option but wait! Macdonald is just across the road.
