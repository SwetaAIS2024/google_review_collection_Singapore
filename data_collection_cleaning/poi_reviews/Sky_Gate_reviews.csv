J G,1,it’s quite amazing how those social media butterflies can make this place look so much better in photographs. i wonder how many mosquitoes bites did they need to suffer when posing there while their camera operators try to find the correct angle and light. not to mention how much editing to make the photos presentable. joke,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102256847058402150550/reviews

M Y,5,"I came here because I wanted to see Sky Gate.
Currently under construction as of December 2023.
I can't go inside.
But I could see it from above.
You could even see it from near the construction site.
Please refer to the photo.

It's inside a big park, so
Besides the gate, the view was amazing.
I thought it would be perfect for a walking course.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112047980642282768584/reviews
