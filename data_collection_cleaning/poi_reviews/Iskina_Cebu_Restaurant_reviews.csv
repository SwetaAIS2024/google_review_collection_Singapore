Jan Matthew,5,"I am an undergraduate student from Nanyang Technological University and a member of the Filipino cultural club. For our end-of-academic-year event, we reached out to Iskina Cebu, and they generously agreed to sponsor a large serving of their delicious lechon along with two trays of flavorful chopsuey.

The coordination was smooth, and their team was incredibly accommodating throughout the process. Our attendees thoroughly enjoyed the dishesâ€”the lechon and chopsuey added a wonderful touch of home to our celebration and made the event even more special.

We are sincerely grateful for their generosity and support, and we definitely look forward to visiting their restaurant to enjoy their amazing food again!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115386014194601926745/reviews
Duval Val,1,Unreasonable price for the taste and portion of the bbq and lechon. Rice also almost half cup. Taste is not the same as before. It looked like I ate a kids meal. Waiting time around 20mins.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114227678695925643422/reviews
Ida Einjaw,5,"Great tasting lechon. I ordered the 500g for $24. Skin is very crispy, nice mild smokiness, good balance of fats and lean meat. Aromatics like spring onions, ginger, garlic and lots of lemongrass makes the meat very fragrant. It's lemongrass overload! Actually the lechon is flavourful enough that no sauce is needed for me.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108652927491238470317/reviews
Dennis Teodoro (D Channel),5,"Very authentic Filipino cuisine. Delicious and the serving is just right. We tried their lechon, sisig, adobo, liempo and laing and we say it is really really good. Very near to Lyf hotel and very close to One-North Station too! It is a must-try Filipino cuisine! They are located in Timbre+ where there is a live band or gig every night. You have to try and comment here if you agree! ðŸ˜Š",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117193042422236231090/reviews
