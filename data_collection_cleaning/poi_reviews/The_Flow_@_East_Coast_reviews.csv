Queen Yasmin,1,"I noticed a serious mosquito problem in this building. Even inside the lift, there were many mosquitoes. Considering there are tuition centres and gymnastics classes here—places where children often go—this could be a health concern. It’s not just the lift; the whole building seems to have this issue. I even visited a beauty shop inside and there were still lots of mosquitoes. I hope the management can look into this and take action to improve the hygiene and environment.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103545625736556289847/reviews
Flo Yeow,3,"I don't know why, but the Flow of Flow Mall, did feel quite off to me. It felt like the mix of shops, restaurants, bars, and just businesses located here in general, is relatively modularly built up, instead of cohesively thought through.

The loft vibes across the entire building feels like the developers didn't have much of a choice, ending up having to squeeze an extra floor, or to make each floor shorter or taller.

One note though... I just can't stop wondering how many of them here are washing money.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Bryan Goh,1,"The building is as accessible as Everest. The car park has a false entrance in case you want convenience. You won’t get it. The actual entrance is similarly hard to navigate. The building is designed to turn you away and if you are unfortunate enough to make it in, to trap you forever.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105851092792063976200/reviews
