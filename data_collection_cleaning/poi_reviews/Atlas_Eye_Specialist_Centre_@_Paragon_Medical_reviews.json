The staff were professional, attentive, and reassuring throughout the entire process. Dr. Chan and his team provided clear explanations and excellent care, making me feel confident and well taken care of. Recovery was smooth, and I‚Äôm very happy with the results. Highly recommend Atlas Eye for anyone considering vision correction surgery!",

      "text": "I had cataracts surgery done by Dr David Chan a month ago. From the first to the final consultation, my experience with Atlas Eye, Dr Chan and all the staff involved has been extremely pleasant and seamless. My journey started with a detailed eye examination which put me at ease as I now know the exact conditions of my eyes. After the surgery date was confirmed I was briefed on what to expect pre and post surgery. Communication has been seamless throughout as my queries  were attended to professionally every time whether in person or through WhatsApp. It was never rushed and I felt I was well informed and looked after. On the day of my surgery which was split into 2 different days, the staff were there on both days to make sure I was ok.  During the surgery, I was quite anxious to begin with especially during the first surgery on my right eye. However after witnessing Dr Chan‚Äôs expertise and what an amazing job he did, I was able to relax during my left eye surgery 2 days later. The post surgery instructions were succinct and mediations packed in such a organised manner that nothing can be misunderstood. I will not hesitate to recommend Atlas eye to anyone who is looking for first class eye care.",

Dr Wong was professional and answered all my enquiries patiently. The whole consultation was not rushed at all and he took time to explain my eye situation and solution to me. The receptionists are friendly and helpful too. Thank you for the excellent service rendered!",

Thank you for your dedication and professionalism.\nFrom making appointments to my surgery only took me one month plus, no long waiting time during appointments although there‚Äôs always quite a number of patients in the clinic. I had done my cataract with multi focus lenses implant. So far my vision is almost perfect as it‚Äôs just 5 days after my surgery. No regrets! No glasses needed anymore :D. The whole surgery process was pain free üëçüèª  it solved my reading and short sighted problem. Glad that I come across your clinic when I google online. I‚Äôm so lucky!",

Dr. Wong was incredibly warm and friendly‚Äîhe made her feel comfortable right away. He reassured us that her corneal abrasion would heal quickly, but also took the time to explain what steps to take if things got worse. The staff were professional and the whole experience was smooth and reassuring. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this clinic to anyone looking for quality care.",
