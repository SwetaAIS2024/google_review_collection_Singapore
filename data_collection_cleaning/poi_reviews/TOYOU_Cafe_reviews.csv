Rene C,5,"I really liked the way the day light streamed into the cafe, made the area feel more bright and airy.

Service staff were all very helpful and polite, service time was quick despite the crowd.

The food was great! My whole family enjoyed all our dishes and even had seconds for the chicken karaage. The sando is a must try as well! And please please do try the strawberry matcha, otherwise it has to be the sea salt latte if you’re into coffee.

Don’t forget to take out some pastries - I had the croissant and scone, they were really yummy and I think their scones are my new favourite now!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109980768062357810585/reviews
Yordan Yit,5,"This cafe offers a rustic charm with metal plates and cups. The food was flavorful and well-prepared, with the creamy truffle udon being a highlight, though it could have been less creamy.

While the cozy ambiance and pet-friendly outdoor seating add to its appeal, better ventilation and clearer signage for steps leading to the restroom would enhance the experience.

Overall, a pleasant visit with great food. With a few improvements, this cafe could truly shine!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111794790666094275154/reviews
YM Tan,5,"TO:YOU Cafe is a cozy, pet-friendly café tucked away in a quiet residential stretch near Kembangan MRT. Its dark green exterior opens into a bright, minimalist space filled with natural light from a skylight — creating a wonderfully airy and welcoming atmosphere.

Despite the open design, the café remains pleasantly cool and comfortable. Even when crowded, the atmosphere stays calm and peaceful, making it easy to relax or have conversations without feeling overwhelmed.

If not for my son bringing me there, I would never have discovered such a hidden gem tucked in this neighborhood.

Food & Drinks Tried

Vanilla Ice Cream:
Served in a delightful glass bowl adorned with cute dog illustrations. The ice cream was creamy, smooth, and not overly sweet — refreshing on a warm day.

Furikake Fries:
Golden, crisp fries topped with furikake seasoning for a savory umami kick. Well-fried and highly addictive — perfect for sharing.

Waffles with Matcha Ice Cream:
A hearty, crispy waffle drizzled with chocolate sauce, topped with rich matcha ice cream and a playful red biscuit. The contrast of warm waffle and cold ice cream was comforting and satisfying.

Coffee & Espresso;
Rounded off the meal with a hot coffee and an espresso shot — aromatic, robust, and a perfect match with the desserts.

Final Thoughts

TO:YOU Cafe is truly a hidden gem in the East. The natural brightness from the skylight lifts the mood, yet the café remains comfortably cool. Even when full, the quiet and cozy vibe makes it perfect for a relaxing brunch, catching up with friends, or simply unwinding.

A heartfelt, community-driven space — and definitely a spot worth revisiting.

Jing L,5,"A ""hidden"" gem at Jalan Senang. The dishes (including the dessert) were executed perfectly. Well done chef!
Weekday dinner - cozy ambience, not overly crowded. The service staff was friendly as well.

A cafe that we will return again, perhaps to try their breakfast and coffee.

Indeed ""Today is a wonderful day."" A good dinner at TO:YOU to end the day on a high note.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104828919516750525001/reviews
Hui Wen Loon,4,"Service was slightly slow.
Loved the truffle carbonara sauce however udon was overcooked. Lost the al dente feels.

Tamago Sando was not too bad although I wouldn’t have preferred it to be the traditional katsu instead of tamago. But creative dish.

Drinks - can be improved. Matcha taste not strong enough.

Pet friendly place also location was rather ulu. Saw a couple of cars kena ticket as there isn’t much proper parking near the cafe…

Overall good vibes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115539226792829764982/reviews
