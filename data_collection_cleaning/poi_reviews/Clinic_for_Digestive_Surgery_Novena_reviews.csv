Yvette Tracey Tang,5,"Thankful to be referred to Dr. Tan Bo Chuan for treatment of cholecystitis after experiencing ‚Äúpain die‚Äù situation overseas. I was able to see Dr. Tan immediately once I was back to SG.

Dr. Tan is friendly and non-intimidating type of doctor. He explained my condition, the potential risks and the surgeries to be done in the most layman English as possible, making my understanding easy. All his clinic assistants are also very professional, friendly and client-centric.

Due to my case, Dr. Tan also work amicably with my  Gastroenterologist, Dr. Eric Wee. Didn‚Äôt expect that I will need 2 specialists for my condition but I am most grateful to both heroes in white coat!

Dr. Tan‚Äôs professionalism is evidenced in his keyholes surgery I did. He is assuring during the process of pre-during-post surgery. The amount of pain and discomfort I had I believe have been reduced to the possible minimum due to Dr. Tan‚Äôs skilful work in the removal of my gallbladder. The keyholes wounds healed nicely in a week‚Äôs time.

On day 9 post surgery, my wounds look like a 0.3mm to 0.5mm thin lines. Wearing of bikinis are still possible! üòÜ

All in all, I am in good hands with Dr. Tan Bo Chuan.

Once again, thankful to Dr. Tan! üôèüèº Highly recommended and definitely deserves a five stars review. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110704834962606236794/reviews
