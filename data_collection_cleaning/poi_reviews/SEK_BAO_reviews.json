      "text": "I happened to pass by and found the menu intriguing. We ordered the lemon chicken rice and a salted fish meat patty rice. The lemon chicken was overwhelmingly sour, lacking the expected balance of sweet and sour flavors. However, the real surprise was their tea—smooth, well-brewed, and free from the harsh, over-steeped bitterness often found elsewhere.\n\nThe ambiance, though lively, felt somewhat cramped due to the tight table arrangement. Service-wise, certain corners of the restaurant seemed overlooked, with waitstaff occasionally missing diners in less visible spots. A bit more attentiveness in these areas would enhance the overall experience.",

The serving speed is impressively fast, making it a perfect spot for a quick yet satisfying meal. The store's HK-style design adds a unique charm, making it a cozy place to enjoy with family and friends. It's also a fantastic spot for taking photos and soaking in the lively atmosphere. Highly recommend!",
