      "text": "An unforgettable stay at an iconic landmark!\n\nThe grounds and architecture are absolutely stunning — rich with history yet immaculately maintained. The interiors are just as impressive, blending heritage charm with modern comfort. Staff were warm, professional, and attentive throughout.\n\nA special shout-out to Vikram the doorman at the entrance — he was so friendly and even remembered our names throughout the stay. We were really impressed by his hospitality.\n\nIt was such a cool experience to stay somewhere so iconic, and I was pleasantly surprised by how modern and luxurious the facilities were (even the bathrooms!). A perfect mix of old-world elegance and contemporary ease.",

Established in the heart of CBDin 1887.\nClassic 19th century British-colonial architectural style and design - White-washed walls, symmetry, ornate wooden detailing, high ceiling, and wide verandas. Relaxing lawn. So beautiful. Like a palace.\nShopping at the Raffle arcade.\nNot hard to find clean toilets.\nFamous Singapore Sling at Long Bar. Afternoon tea at the Grand Lobby, but no live music, unfortunately.\nProfessional staff.\nNice experience.",

The room was clean and comfortable and easy to personalize with the tablet. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. I loved my time here. I will definitely book again when I visit Singapore.",
