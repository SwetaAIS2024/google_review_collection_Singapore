S. Lee,1,"When I first sent my child here, there were too many students compared to the number of teachers
So when I inquired at the academy, they made excuses like the teacher was temporarily absent... I felt like children other than those in rhythmic gymnastics were being neglected.

Because there were too few teachers, while some kids were learning gymnastics, the rest seemed to be left to their own devices, playing elsewhere.

Despite it being close to home, I had to eventually stop sending my child here because of these issues.

AND, It's been two months since I stopped, but I still haven't received my deposit back
They impose fees immediately when a student pays tuition late, but this academy has been breaking promises and withholding my deposit for two months despite having the money to give back to me
so Bad !!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227102046504780112/reviews
