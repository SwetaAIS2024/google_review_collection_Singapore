阿宝,4,"Had my Sunday morning walk from Pasir Ris and then breakfast at this coffee shop that is within walking distance the Tampines Polyclinic.

The male staff looks fierce but when he took order, he became an entirely different person.  So polite, friendly & considerate :-)

We ordered the breakfast set & only paid $3.50 which if we order from the two famous kopi places in shopping mall…. AK or TB, it will easily cost us another $2!

Love the bread texture as it is soft. & they are generous in their kaya & butter spread!

Love the teh!  Thick & not too sweet.  Nice!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
Leslie Lee,3,"Ordered coffee, eggs and toast set.
Price @ $3.50 - Can be more affordable.
Coffee - Good, one of the better one.
Eggs - Normal, nicely done.
Toast - Below average, not sure why there is no sliced butter in my toast, only see and taste kaya. Kaya is too sweet and the toasts is way too sweet without sliced butter or margarine to balance off the taste.

I was in a rush and did not check with the staffs. Hope that it is just a missed on their end.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101111784449349364218/reviews
