Gayan Chathuranga,5,"Chinatown MRT Station (NE4/DT19) is a vibrant and centrally located transit hub in Singapore, serving the North-East Line (NEL) and Downtown Line (DTL). Situated in the heart of Chinatown, it provides easy access to one of Singapore‚Äôs most culturally rich and historic neighborhoods.

The station features eye-catching design elements that reflect the heritage of Chinatown, with artwork and motifs inspired by traditional Chinese culture. Its proximity to iconic attractions like the Chinatown Heritage Centre, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, and Sri Mariamman Temple makes it a popular stop for both tourists and locals.

Chinatown MRT is surrounded by a variety of dining, shopping, and entertainment options, including hawker stalls, souvenir shops, and boutique stores. It‚Äôs also well-connected, offering seamless transfers between the NEL and DTL, making it a convenient starting point for exploring other parts of Singapore.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115580882753025627106/reviews
Flo Yeow,2,"The Chinatown MRT station itself is insanely crowded, messy, and incoherent in my personal opinion. It feels exactly like how Chinatown feels like.

The unfortunate fact is that I'd personally have preferred if they put more thoughts in how they'd do up the Blue Downtown line, vs the Purple North East line, and how everything connects a little better, like other train stations in Singapore would.

This feels a lot more like Hong Kong unfortunately.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
