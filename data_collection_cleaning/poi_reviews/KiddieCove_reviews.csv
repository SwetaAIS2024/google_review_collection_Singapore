Walaa Sh basatneh,5,"Our son went there for almost a year and a half. Every weekend he was looking forward for Monday to come so he can go back to school. Every day there are lessons and sensory activities. From gardening, cooking, music to water sports. The teachers and Ms Faridah are wonderful!
Highly recommend, you will be happy and your munchkin will be ecstatic!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118409387505385757965/reviews
Estrella Cho (판교망고맘),5,"My child spent two months happily at Kidicove. The teacher sent me photos of what my child did each day, which always made me feel safe even when I was abroad. If anyone comes to Johor Bahru with a child, I would recommend Kidicove without hesitation.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112540679761176178380/reviews
Raíssa Pereira,5,"When I moved to Malaysia and visited Kiddie Cove, I confess that I was unsure whether to enroll my children, who were 3 years old and 1 year and 8 months old at the time, because the structure was small compared to the school my 3-year-old son studied at in Thailand.
However, I was pleasantly surprised because what seemed small in terms of infrastructure was huge in terms of the quality of teaching and love for the children.
My son's English improved at an impressively fast rate and my daughter, who at the time could not speak, also started to learn a few words, and today, having just turned 3, she knows colors, the alphabet, numbers, days of the week, among others.
The director was always very present and respectful of our opinions and parenting principles.
I truly recommend this school! It is a place where we can feel the love from the teachers, the playful way in which they teach the children so well, and we can follow all of this very closely due to the constant feedback and photos.
What I can say is that we will all miss and will always be grateful for the time our children spent here.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116431978053943214253/reviews

Sofie Kornum,5,"Having enrolled our son into Kiddie Cove made the adjustment period in a new country so much easier! From day one our son loved the structure as well as the activities, that are always fun, creative and educative. A part from making lots of new friends he improved a lot in English and in a variety of life skill situations. The principal and the teachers are really competent and kind. We appreciate the daily updates, photos and communication a lot. I have already recommended Kiddie Cove to other parents and I would be happy to do so again. Thank you for taking good care of our son!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102670799974029859371/reviews
