Marc Morgan,4,"Nice rides, but unfortunately some were under maintenance for us. Wave pool is nice, but a little small. Food is okay at the restaurant. The lazy river is great and has a nice theme to it. Wild Wild Wet is an alternative to this and half the price with more rides and a wave pool.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101401942962530182857/reviews
Jennifer Liepin,5,"I had a great time and for $25 Singapore if you use Klook. Wait time was generally about 15 minutes per slide unless you did the magic carpet slide - no wait. Unique waterpark. Pretty different from the US. I‚Äôm attaching pictures of the cost of food - prices -, as no one else has done that. Also, no one checked our bags so you can bring food in even if they say not to. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107459204527494230825/reviews
Nina R.,5,This is a wonderful park!  The lazy river takes you to all the attractions and it goes through the Ray Bay where the rays come up to the glass and try to splash over the glass wall haha it‚Äôs cute.  There‚Äôs a dolphin experience and you have options of interacting with them.  There are plenty of lockers and full body blow dry machines.  The restaurant is very nice with some veggie options.  There are some beer and cocktails.  My favorite was the Rainbow Reef and the Riptide Rocket water slide.  Not too scary just a quick thrill.  You won‚Äôt be disappointed if you come here.  It‚Äôs clean and not too many pesky birds.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108104869829155726108/reviews
pr Teo,5,"Nice place for family fun!
My kids loved the waves and lazy river.  The DJ was amazing at the wave section ( if only it's a daily session). Do buy your own waterproof phone pouches BEFORE going..else it retails for $40/45 in the souvenir shop. Wish there were water dispensers around thou.
Food and drinks are pretty pricey( mains cost around 15 and up, drinks cost $4 and up. The walk from rws was a pretty short one( within 5mins instead of 13 indicated by goggle map).",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103497961728941445272/reviews
Saksham Sehgal,5,"Since the time of entering this grand Waterpark, me and my partner were not falling short of surprises and thrills across rides! Pokemon themed elements and the parade was a nice experience.

Coming to eateries, plenty of options to enjoy in the Bay Restaurant.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106839680426689363824/reviews
