Sufen Lee,4,Visited a community farm within the school that was birthed 5 months back. Lovely people who were quietly sowing the ground and sharing of experiences/knowledge. Looking forward to the growth of this urban farm!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101269803193723353169/reviews
Joel Langton,1,"Speaking from personal experience as an ex-student.
- Teachers can prove to be unreliable. Graduated students will oversee as substitute who lack professional training in being able to conduct themselves appropriately due to lack of experience.

- Lack of proper safety practices. Special needs individuals enroll here as a sanctuary but there are times where their behavior goes unchecked and results in an unstable environment.
Having seen a docile handicapped wheelchaired child being brutally beaten by an aggressor only for the aggressive child to continue being allowed to enroll. It sends a strong message to those who are unable to defend themselves in such chaotic environments that they aren't cared for considering its meant to be a safe haven with strong Christian values.

-Fees are incredibly expensive considering that your child will mainly be self-taught in class. Teachers often are ill equipped even those who are of older age to guide your child into learning.
Answers for each ACE booklet which is assigned to each child according to their level of learning removes the need for teachers to be vigilant in ensuring your child learns.

I strongly suggest not bringing your child here. I speak as an ex-student that came in with a positive mindset with utmost respect for the school's rules , teachers and peers but I hope you may use this as reference.

Perhaps your child may not experience or have to bare witness to such things but you may want to consider other schools for your child and test the waters first beforehand before jumping into this.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114028222281252642241/reviews
mengg,1,"i dont recommend coming to this school. my friend experienced being here and unless you like to be brought up in a christian environment, i highly recommend you going to other schools instead. they will persuade u to become christian, and have alot of expectations for you. very little art related stuff n maths n science here also cannot make it. they will also persuade u to go to rsc, claiming its compulsory and get u to donate money to them. sch fees here also r so overpriced, and if u want to leave the sch, they will keep persuading u to change your mind n stay.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117763651284236065120/reviews
