Chinese Moon,1,"Pricey with poor and slow service.  Ban mian store was chaotic, letting people cluster waiting to collect their food.  People ordering according to the line ended up lining up without line moving forward as others came from opposite direction cut queue as those waiting for their food were blocking.  The menu was deceptive too.  Ordered Tom yum noodles and was asked if wanted pork or seafood.  Seeing the menu had seafood prices $7.50 which was $2 more than pork, I went with pork but was charged for seafood and told that it was because the soup was Tom yum.  Then don‚Äôt ask for choice if the meat is not the same as the menu‚Äôs base offering.  The young guy there was extremely disorganized too as I saw him charge another customer twice to the annoyance of the customer.  He also did not close the cover of the packed soups for delivery.  I pity those who ordered from Deliveroo or foodpanda as it will definitely spill along the way.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106735384857518209558/reviews
