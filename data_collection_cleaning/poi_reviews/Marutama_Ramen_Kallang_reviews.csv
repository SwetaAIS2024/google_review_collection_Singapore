Jasper koh,5,"Simple yet flavourful chicken stock ramen.

I really enjoyed Marutama Ramen. The ramen noodle had a good texture to it, not too soft and hard.
The chicken stock was something I could keep drinking, if they allowed top ups, I would definitely top up.

A good place to satisfy your ramen cravings for sure.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103969433559486829987/reviews
Wesley Wong,3,"Marutama Ramen at Leisure Park Kallang struggles with being understaffed, especially during weekend peak hours. The staff members work tirelessly to keep up with the crowd, but it’s clear that there simply aren’t enough hands on deck. Despite the pressure, they remain efficient and courteous, which is commendable given the hectic environment.

As for the food, it’s rather average. While Marutama is known for its signature chicken-based broth, the ramen here doesn’t particularly stand out compared to other ramen shops in Singapore. The broth lacks depth, and the overall flavor profile is neither rich nor memorable. The noodles are cooked to an acceptable texture, but there’s nothing exceptional about them.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107433449088212182977/reviews
Clo’s Laobu,4,"At first I thought I’ll get disappointed with the ramen from its menu but it didn’t. The chicken base soup makes the soup taste savoury and flavourful.

Woo TY,1,"Q for 30mins during lunch rush on a Saturday. Sub par ramen restaurant with no air conditioning in the mall. Food was passable but for the price, air conditioning should be available. Was perspiring the whole meal. Service was ok. Ramen is ok but has better ones, maybe the humid feeling ruined the taste and experience altogether. Management should ensure proper ventilation and air conditioning.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103222407418223546799/reviews
Jeffrey Poh,5,Would like to compliment Zhong Hin for his excellent service. We are a family of 4 but we accidentally ordered 5 bowls of ramen using the online ordering portal. He was very sharp to have noticed it and patiently asked if we would like to takeaway the extra ramen or refund and reorder. He is definitely an asset to Marutama Ramen.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109972777653261547435/reviews
