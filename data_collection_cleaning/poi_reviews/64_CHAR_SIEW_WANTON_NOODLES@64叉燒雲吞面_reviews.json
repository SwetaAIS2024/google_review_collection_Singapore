Char siew is underwhelming but wanton was decent enough. Fried wanton even comes with mayonnaise dip. Overall a decent brunch to last you till dinner. Definitely fills your wanton noodles crave in the middle of nowhere.",

So during this visit in Feb 2024, this place is on top of my list.\nThis morning, I finally get to taste their yummy food again! I had the King Prawn Noodle dry (comes with big bowl of soup), a small Ngoh Hiang and a small Thai Squid.\nDry King Prawn Noodle- fantasticly delicious with their sambal and crunchy pork lard.\nPrawn soup- the aroma is enough to convince you, plus the taste is just heavenly.\nNgoh Hiang-mild in taste, not too heavily spiced, the fillings taste moist and fresh.\nThai Squid- the squid is cooked to perfection, soft yet maintained it's lovely texture.\nOverall, this is still my favourite place for Prawn Noodle, best in S'pore in my list.",

      "text": "Located in of one of the coffeeshops inside Loyang industrial area which is also famous for their prawn noodles. They are the 2nd or 3rd stall once you step into the coffeeshop, signboard is pretty prominent and you can‚Äôt miss it. Wanton noodle starts from SGD$4 onwards.\n\nThe wanton noodle here is the black sauce type one. The portion is quite adequate, it comes with 4 plump wantons and generous amount of nicely roasted charsiew. Noodle was nicely cooked and chili has a hint of smokiness to it. Could be a better bowl if the the sauce is not that thick.\n\nCoffeeshop is quite out of the way to be honest. Unless if you are working nearby or if you happen to be visiting Loyang Tua pek gong temple.",
