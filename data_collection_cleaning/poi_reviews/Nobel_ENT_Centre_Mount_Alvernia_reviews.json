      "text": "I am incredibly grateful to Dr. Annette and Sarah for their exceptional care and professionalism in treating my twin children. Dr. Annette is wonderfully gentle and efficient, knowing exactly how to handle kids who are often scared during their endoscopy appointments. She provides such reassurance and understanding, not just for the kids, but for parents like me as well. The improvement in both of my children’s sleep quality has been remarkable since we started seeing Dr. Annette. I am truly thankful to have found a doctor and team who are so caring and dedicated. Highly recommend!",

She did the surgery for me, it went very well and the post-surgery care, and support has been great.  At Dr. Ang's clinic, you have the two most helpful assistance - Sarah and Chelsea.  They are very professional, polite and know their work very well.  I would recommend Dr. Ang and her team.",

      "text": "I truly feel incredibly fortunate to have met Dr. Annette Ang, who treated my son’s hearing condition. She gave us invaluable advice and created a clear treatment and intervention plan for him. Even within just two visits, she carefully pointed out many important things I should pay attention to, and offered me tremendous encouragement and confidence. Without her, I would have likely fallen into a state of helplessness and negativity.\nI’m also deeply grateful to Chelsea at the front desk, who always responded promptly and patiently, helping me sort out all the follow-up matters and allowing me to focus on my son’s care without any worries.\nThank you as well to every staff member at NOBEL ENT—you are all like angels. I feel truly blessed to have found this clinic. Thank you again from the bottom of my heart!",

My husband followed Dr Ang’s recommendations on completing some tests and took some medication. After about 3 weeks, my husband recovered and his hearing is back to normal under Dr Ang’s care. I also wanted to comment on Dr Ang’s staff. Their friendliness and helpful attitude makes visiting the clinic so pleasant. Thank you once again.",
