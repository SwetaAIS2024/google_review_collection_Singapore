Except the fact that itâ€™s in a hotel lobby everything else is perfect ðŸ˜† wouldnâ€™t say too much about the food, but check out their wine list. Will always be my all time favorite",

Great place to appreciate curated wine & champagne selection with a food menu that features lounge setting bites and substantial dishes to fill the stomach from the F&B establishment within the hotel. A comfortable spot for sundowner wind down to late night hang out.",

We got a brunello at $130 and the Hokkien mee was amazing and they were so nice to split the portion into 2 for us. We also got the cheese platter which we couldn't finish. Overall I would definitely come back again!",

The service was really good. Attentive and friendly staff. However, for a fancy wine place, I felt that the sommeliers could have been more knowledgeable and descriptive with their wines. The food menu is a combination of trimmed down menus from the hotel's restaurants, so there'll be something for everyone. Our bill for a party of 5 worked out to around $800.",
