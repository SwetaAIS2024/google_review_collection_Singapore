While I appreciate the quality of the food and service, I was surprised to learn that requesting hot plain water to adjust the saltiness of a soup base was not accommodated. Instead, I was informed by a staff member at Hot Hideout that only tap water was available.\n\nIn my opinion, providing hot water for such a request is a reasonable expectation, as it enhances customer satisfaction and allows guests to tailor their meal to their preference. I believe a small adjustment like this would greatly improve the dining experience and demonstrate greater flexibility in customer service.",

The ordering system is quite efficient.\n\nI was curious what was so different about this mala place from the others, and I got my answers. The deep fried lotus roots, the flow scrambled eggs in the soup, that singaporean-ness of the soup base that was more nourishing and less intense than the China version.\n\nAlso it was amazing that I saw zero PRC Chinese customers, and all were singaporeans.\n\nI must say this was my most enjoyable mala experience, looking forward to trying another soup base with the scrambled eggs.",
