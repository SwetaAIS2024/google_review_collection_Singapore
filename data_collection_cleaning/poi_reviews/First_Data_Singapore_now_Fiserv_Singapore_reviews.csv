Son Son Tan,1,Our company liaise with First Data for almost 1 month but couldn't settle the refund matter. I believe they outsource their customer service team. I'm not sure whether they have other team is working because no one can help or communicate with us except the reading script customer officer. I feel so  disappointed with the service.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114631018785975617907/reviews
andrew wong,1,"Very bad service from this company, hotline service is call centre at Philippines, apply their company credit card terminals, wait for almost 1 month still no set.up, sales person never answer phone call and even WhatsApp msg take few days to reply, in the end cancel the application and move on to others. Even their rate is cheaper we just don't think we want to have this type of terrible services.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107907199015394741434/reviews
