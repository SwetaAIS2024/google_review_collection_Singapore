Ens Lee,5,"I had an excellent experience at IELTS University. Jonathan, our instructor, was incredibly knowledgeable and shared invaluable study techniques that made preparing for the IELTS exam much more manageable. His years of experience really showed in how he could pinpoint common mistakes and help us improve quickly.
The study method he taught us was practical and effective - I particularly appreciated how he broke down each section of the test into digestible parts. His approach helped build both my confidence and competence in all four skills: reading, writing, listening, and speaking.
Highly recommend this class to anyone preparing for IELTS. The investment was definitely worth it!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107358495141188564972/reviews

The reviews were compelling, so I decided to enroll in his class. Through his instruction, I uncovered many essential factors to consider before taking the test. I learned how to discern and tackle challenging questions in the reading and listening sections. We were supplied with an ample array of resources for vocabulary and grammar enhancement, among other aspects. If you require preparation before sitting for the exam, as I did, I highly recommend Jonathanâ€™s class; the depth of information and support is exceptionally beneficial.
