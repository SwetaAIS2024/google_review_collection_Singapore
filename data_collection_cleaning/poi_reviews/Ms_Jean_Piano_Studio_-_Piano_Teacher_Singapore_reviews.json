His hard work, coupled with Miss Jean’s consistency in her quality of teaching as well as her patience and gentle guidance has greatly encouraged him to pursue his interests in piano. One can definitely sense her sincerity and genuineness when teaching a student, and she always makes sure that a student is fully ready before taking any examinations. Definitely highly recommend her as a piano teacher; whether for beginners or intermediate.",
