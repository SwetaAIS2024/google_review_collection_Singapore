Doraemon,5,"Today was a truly special day! Kitty and I made our way to Sri Murugan Hill Temple to celebrate Ganesha's birthday.  It was such a beautiful and peaceful temple, with a unique structure unlike anything I've seen before.  We were drawn to the vibrant colors and intricate carvings, and the atmosphere was filled with a sense of devotion and tranquility.

We were so happy to be able to offer our prayers and blessings to Ganesha.  It felt incredibly powerful to be surrounded by so many other devotees who were also celebrating his birthday.  Kitty and I both felt a sense of peace and connection as we offered our prayers and offerings.

Aparna A,5,"This beautiful temple of Lord Muruga is not really situated on a hill, but is at an elevated level which can very easily be accessed by climbing some steps. This temple is just a 2 minutes walk from Bukit Panjang MRT station.

This temple has beautiful, colourful statues of all Gods and Goddesses. Apart from Lord Muruga, shrines of Lord Shiva and Parvathi along with several other Gods like Ayyapan, Durga are all present, including that of Lord Buddha",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115841588924741000793/reviews
