Desiree Lim,5,"This place is managed by the RC of the neighbourhood. Users who visit here regularly are usually residents residing around the area. The gate has a padlock which only members of the dog run have the code to it. U can sign up as a member for a minimal fee for access, or wait till there's someone inside but for the latter, you'll have to leave once the member leaves.

Typical dog run rules apply like making sure the dog you off leash does not show aggression and you are constantly looking after your dog. Picking up poo is also standard protocol. Apart from these, no commercial activities are to be held in the dog run as well for the safety or assurance of visiting dogs..

Lights are out at about 1015pm everyday.

There are long running members who monitors the dog run and treat it with lots of love. So it will be nice for other users to do the same!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112586785323936062473/reviews
Jezz Leong,1,"small dog park run by the residents there. not open to public unless inside got people (i guess). experienced a member over there who kp** so much over my dog & without asking for permission, just carried my dog (who's new there) & brought it to us to ask us to leash my very friendly puppy, cuz there are other members entering the dog run. rude. cannot just wait meh?
& when my pup is just playing around with other dogs there, the same woman keep over there call my dog's name in those 'aiyo' tone. seriously the member self entitled or what? don't bother going there. won't make any pawrents friends. only will give you high blood pressure and cancer. would've given ZERO stars if had the choice.

oh, member even asked us where we stay, and how we found the dog park. answered her & guess what? she shake head & say she will write in to remove this private place from google maps. lol yes please, such attitude from such a community don't deserve the public's kindness. y'all can just continue to hang in the small & boring area of yours.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114436658073288353287/reviews
