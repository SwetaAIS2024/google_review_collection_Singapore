They charged consultation charge even for vaccination, which other clinics don't, but they say all other clinics charges too, which is totally not true and  a lie.\nAlso, vaccination for influenza itself is much more expensive than other clinics in Singapore.\nAll the total, you have to pay 75Dollors for vaccination.",

      "text": "The worst experience. Overcharged for a consultation fee of 60 dollars without any detailed explanation and was given supplements that can be found elsewhere at a much lower price. Additionally, An unnecessary reference letter was given for my helper's pass renewal, which lacked any supporting evidence. This led to thousands of dollars spent on specialist visits that was ultimately meaningless and a waste of time. You're better off going to heartland clinic, even long queue there and here is no quere at all, at least you'll get better value for your time and money.",

      "text": "I had a very disappointing experience at this clinic. I made an appointment for my 15-month-old’s vaccine, but we ended up waiting for over an hour because other patients with reviews were prioritized. The clinic also pushed optional Hep B vaccines, despite my daughter already having it, probably didn’t even check her health booklet or kept updated on what was previously administered already. The doctor (Alex Teo) insisted their vaccines were superior to those at the Polyclinic, where we’ve had all previous jabs and reassured us that it was what she needed at 15 months . But horrifyingly, my daughter didn’t receive a pneumococcal vaccine, and I only learned about it three weeks later from the Polyclinic as this record was missing from the govt’s system. TLDR;  If you're considering a place for your child's vaccinations, save yourself the trouble and go to Polyclinic.This clinic’s mistakes, lack of knowledge and overall experience were frustrating, and I won't be returning. I’m baffled why this place was recommended by Kids R Us.\n\nFYI there is a $50 for first consultation for vaccines. This was also not told upfront.",
