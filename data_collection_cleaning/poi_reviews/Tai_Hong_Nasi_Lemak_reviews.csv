Gan Kl,4,"Ordered their mee rubus & nasi lemak. The aroma of the mee rubus brings back my school days memories in the 80s. The taste almost make me time travelled. The fragrance of their nasi lemak rice is just amazing, together with their sambal chilli, i can't find a word to describe. Thank you for the hardwork to bring us these wonderful dishes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109770372191676866852/reviews
Ronnie Tok,4,"Little known, understated stall selling one of the best nasi lemak. Chicken and fried egg are freshly fried and rice is served hot. Sometimes they would serve directly even though a queue tokenis given. Friendly service and budget meal. Glad to have discovered this place. Carpark is convenient but the block is somewhat deep inside the neighbourhood.
Coffee shop seating can be a little cramp as tables are placed quite close to each other",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106648660045863210175/reviews
