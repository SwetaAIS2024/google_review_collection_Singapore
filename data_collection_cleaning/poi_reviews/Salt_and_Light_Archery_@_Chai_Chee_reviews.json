      "text": "We booked this place for a small gathering and was initially hesitant about trying it. However, it turned out to be an amazing experience! We opted for a package that included a trainer and some interactive games, which made the session even more enjoyable.\n\nThe trainer was fantastic—funny, engaging, and very interactive. He made sure everyone felt comfortable and understood how to play. At first, we were just learning the basics, but soon we got the hang of it and started having a great time.\n\nAs we became more confident, the friendly competition kicked in, making the experience even more exciting. There was even a mini prize for the winner, which added a nice touch. But in the end, it wasn’t about winning—it was about having fun and bonding with friends.\n\nTime flew by because we were so immersed in the experience. If you’re looking for a unique and entertaining way to bond with friends or colleagues, I highly recommend trying this out. It’s a great way to enjoy some laughter, teamwork, and friendly rivalry all in one session. Definitely a must-try for anyone seeking a fun and memorable gathering!!",

      "text": "Appalling that the female petite coach seems cold blooded. I expressed that I need help to pluck out the 3rd arrow (after removing the other 2 on my own), as it was firmly stuck in the target. Instead of offering help, she just stood there and pushed the blame on me. In the end, it is another bigger build kind female coach/assistant who intelligently came over to help (She also took initiative to help me correct my posture, thumbsup). I am highly independent, being able to even travel overseas on my own. It is rare for me to ask for help and this is what I get from a service provider. Is she a self-declared princess or queen? If so, then I think it is very unkind and selfish of her to tarnish the reputation of the company.\n16/11/2024 3-5pm session",
