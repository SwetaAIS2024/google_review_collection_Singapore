Nish Ronaldo,5,"Went for dinner last night, the mutton and beef satay was delicious! The meat was very tender and had a nice char, it was tasty even without the sauce! Ketupat was soft too.

Otah was good, it wasn‚Äôt sweet.

Wanted to try their chicken rice but sadly it was sold out, had the mee goreng cutlet instead, it was spicy!

The lady boss was very friendly! She came to check on us once we were almost done.

Would definitely come back for the satays! We tapao-ed 20 more sticks home.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106439666139489027922/reviews
