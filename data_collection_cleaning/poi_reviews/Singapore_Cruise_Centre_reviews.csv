Kesmond Kwek,4,"Unlike Airport, Cruise Center needs to clear thousands of passengers through at one single port at a very short time. The queuing can be frustrating, the waiting can be tiring. There is just a few seats before the custom area. Can be tough for those elderly cruise passengers. I do understand of the layout at custom area, however, about 30 seats for thousands of passengers is truly a misplanned. With extremely limited seats, there are still passengers use their belongings to ""reserve"" seat for companion. There are hundreds of seats at holding area before immigration. Overall, cruise center is efficient and clean.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106594644998430315896/reviews
Dariush Malekirad,1,"I used this port 4 times and every time the officers treated me differently. And custom clearance was also having different kind of checking. I was confused with what I should have or haven't in my luggage, even when I was traveling there for transit.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104139036588813086611/reviews

Dr Reviews,4,"A great place from where one could  travel to places in neighbouring Indonesia including Batam and Bintan.

The ferry schedules generally run on time.  The staff do their job well but could certainly be a lot more polite.

Expect a longer queue during weekends,  public holidays and school holidays. So it's important to plan one's trip carefully.

Upon return to Singapore the queue at customs where the bags are thoroughly checked can be painfully long even during off peak periods.  Only one xray machine was in operation causing the queue.

The terminal has money changers and if one needs to change money its best to enquire rates at a couple of shops.

The terminal has sufficient food and beverage options apart from shops selling souvenirs.

Before i forget the terminal has a duty free shop and atm machines as well.  A terminal with all necessary facilities.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112747621045786494145/reviews
