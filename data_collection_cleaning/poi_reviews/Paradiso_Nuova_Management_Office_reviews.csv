Edafe Mathew,1,"Condo service is just worse! Every month there is issue, horrible property management who makes it not nice to live. It can take months to repair the lift in block (A) whenever it is broken down.

Security doors to my building block (A) are broken in the open position for months so anyone could walk in. The lift security key does not function easily to access any floor, It seems like every month one more thing is broken. The common area from level 4 up to the rooftop lack of maintenance.

Another thing, each time it rains heavily there is leakage in my living room and my bedrooms, it's really annoying cos the owner has no interest in fixing it.

I will aabsolutely not renew my lease and it is because of this horrible management and the owner of my unit",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110550309194713869055/reviews

Joshua Sham,1,"If you have no issues with the following, then you should consider staying here :

No nearby convenient stores;
The security here is questionable;
The only road that leads to the entrance is one way so if you need to exit on the road on the opposite direction, you're looking at a u turn close to a kilometre away;
The eateries nearby (like 3 of them) are always closed and do not coincide with the opening hours shown on Google maps.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104124993954856714465/reviews
