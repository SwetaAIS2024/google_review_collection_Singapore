Portion was decent and the ingredients were pretty much bite size. Lettuce was fresh, 1 boiled egg(would be better if they are Ajitama eggs) and chicken was tender but batter has a little smell. Possibly the oil that was used to fry the chicken, was reused a few times. It will be nicer to have mango salad in the dish.\n\nI enjoyed their Thai Milk Tea which I appreciated that it can be customised in terms of the sweetness.\n\nTotal damage : $9",
