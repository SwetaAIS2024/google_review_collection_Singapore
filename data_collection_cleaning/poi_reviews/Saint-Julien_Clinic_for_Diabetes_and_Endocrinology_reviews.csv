Soo Shuan Goh,1,"I was 5mins late today for my appointment (1015am) this morning and the next patient came in 5 mins early (1025am) for her 1030am appointment.   I knew the next patient had appointment time after mine because I was there earlier than her and overheard her conversation with receptionist when she arrived.  The receptionist then let the patient go in to see the doctor before me.  When I questioned the receptionist about it, she claims it was because it’s doctor’s policy to always serve patient that is early for appointment rather than admitting she made a mistake n apologise.

I waited till 1125am to see the doctor eventually.  When I question doctor when I went in for my appointment, again the doctor evaded my question on his weird policy and says he would investigate.  I decided to give the doctor a chance since he claim he would investigate but I have yet to hear back from the clinic.

This shows a lack of integrity and accountability to their patients and how the entire medical profession seem to expect all patients to just wait however long it takes.  They put their own profits and benefits ahead of patient’s time.  It is a very disappointing experience for me at this clinic.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114975432703659529996/reviews
Amy MacDonald,5,I have a good experience with the treatment I received through Dr. Goh. He was direct and straightforward and was helpful throughout the past years.
