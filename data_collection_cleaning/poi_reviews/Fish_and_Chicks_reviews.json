      "text": "Was a patron 2 months prior, food was decent and filling. Today's dish was horrible, carbonara sauce looked like it was made of curdled cream, it was watery and wasn't thick enough to coat the pasta noodles.\n\nOh also, it's apparently \"truffle carbonara\", but there was barely a hint of it in the pasta. The grilled chicken didn't smell right and was rubbery, I suspect it might be really old. Couldn't bring myself to finish the chicken as the smell was making me lose my appetite.\n\nEating here before, I had come to expect the same quality and taste but I was sorely mistaken. Considering the hefty $10 price tag and the possiblity of an upset stomach, you can say I'll never eat here again.\n\nExtremely disappointed, save your money, eat somewhere else. P.S if I get food poisoning, I'll update my review.",

Nonetheless, proceeded to attempt to eat the food as I was hungry by then, and the order took 66min to arrive. But the food was terrible. Fish was soggy & chicken felt sour, old and wet. Please avoid, not worth despite the hefty ongoing offers.",
