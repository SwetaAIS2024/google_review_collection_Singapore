Tasha Arriola,2,Bought double prosperity beef burger they gave us single. Bought double mc spicy cheese. They gave us double Mc spicy without cheese. Meaning we paid more but got not what we ordered. And it wasn't even crowded to begin with. Very disappointed really.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108249473494934426414/reviews
Edmund Teo,1,"Ordered via Grab for 6 pcs of crispy spicy chicken at 9pm and it was delivered at 945pm. It was the worst chicken I had in past decade. Chicken has obviously been deep fried several times. It's tough and dry to the point I cannot tell if I was biting into the flesh or the bone anymore. Like a jerky tough, its disgusting.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104389708992440712775/reviews
Jeremy Lim,3,"Had breakfast here, ordered the sausage mcgriddles with egg and milo. Had few sips of the milo and was diluted, so I went to ask for a change. And it felt the same. I think your staff should try a small cup after prepping the milo to ensure quality. Ain't expecting milo dinosaur kind of thick but definitely not so diluted yea?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107019858916474894149/reviews
Sabrina Tan,3,"Very disappointed when I decided to takeaway big breakfast for my kids. Not only have you increased the price, the food is disappointing and even scrambled eggs have had a shortcut. The combo looks makes you feel you have been swindled of what was meant to be larger than a muffin with the same ingredients and still less of a cheese.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106320435416764921834/reviews
