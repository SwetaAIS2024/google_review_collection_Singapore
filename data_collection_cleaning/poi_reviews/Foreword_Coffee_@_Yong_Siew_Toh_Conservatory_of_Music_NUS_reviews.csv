Dylan Li,3,"Can't speak for the coffee, but I've gotten snacks a few times before class at YST. The food is quite expensive, particularly the muffins being around $5 iirc. That being said, the muffins taste great. The croissant was nice and crispy, but the sandwich was small and the meat was a bit tough. I can't really recommend going out of your way to get the food here, but it's a convenient, tasty, albeit pricey option if you go to YST and are in a pinch.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227455027475284936/reviews
GH,4,"The cafe is tuck at a cosy yet scenic corner of the conservatory . The tables are spaced out for you to take in tranquil vibes .

Coffee is thick and aromatic . Bakery is fluffy and quite to standard . And they offer rice bowl during lunch hour too !

The staff has hearing impairment however ordering made easy through a simple menu . I find the effort to customise the cafe setup to accommodate the staff is very commendable .

Would definitely visit again !",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101252855469598813164/reviews

Su Ann,3,"A quiet space within the campus. We came here purposely because the good reviews online.

The menu itself was not fantastic. There were only a handful of items to choose from. The service staff at the counter was very impatient.

Food wise, the croissants were good. We ordered specialty Yuan Yang but it was so so.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108986585577231909472/reviews
