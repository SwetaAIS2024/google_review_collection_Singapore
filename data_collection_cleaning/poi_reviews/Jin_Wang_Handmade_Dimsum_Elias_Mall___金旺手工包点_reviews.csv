Jacky Ong,2,"The Da Bao is good, tasty and juicy. However the Har gow is a total letdown. Skin is powdery and torn. The prawn is small and lumpy, totally not fresh.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117944778252314011232/reviews
clement,5,The big pao is my favourite here. Filling is generous and very juicy. Skin is not thick unlike alot places. Other dimsum are also fresh. Other favourites are century egg siew Mai and fried beancurd skin prawn roll,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109998912959283910136/reviews
Tan Thiam Hock,5,"Went in the late afternoon so wasn’t crowded. Bought this 大包. The bun and meat filling was well-defined. Filling was flavourful and juicy. Following this, I bought more other buns to bring home. The food is good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112182740534629336651/reviews
Jun Kai Toh,4,"Tried almost everything on the menu except Chicken Feet (never was a fan of it).
Everything is good except Fan Choy which I never liked anyways, and Carrot Cake; it is not as tasty and crispy. Char Siew Steamed Rice Roll is way below that of the Shrimp version.
Small Paus are too dense.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107198429972623127094/reviews
zhi yang sim,5,"First time trying this after a few failed attempts to get their paus. The quality and ratio of the skin and filling was good, though to some people the filling might be too little",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105929993325081842596/reviews
