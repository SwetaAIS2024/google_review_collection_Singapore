LEE daryl,4,Ordered sliced beef kuay teow soup and beef brisket kuay teow dry (thick gravy). Both were very good. Broth was flavourful. Beef was tender. Generous lightly pickled onion slices and chilli condiments nicely elevated the food.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108531494959724961440/reviews
Gerald H,5,"This stall took over the previous owner who sold the same food and I have to give the point to Cowboy for its generous portion and quality food.

Good beef noodles are hard to come by and this definitely checks my box. Please maintain the standard and donâ€™t scrimp on your portion. I will come back many times for sure!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103966161734409501390/reviews
Dan N,4,First time trying despite passing by a few times. Really a very decent bowl of tasty beef slice noodles. Could have been 5stars if not for quite a few pieces of beef slice that have unchewabke viens/tendons. Will be back if I have cravings for beef noodles.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113578043896522398982/reviews

Gillian Lin,4,"Pretty good bowl of beef noodles. Signature bowl is $12.... Lots of ingredients, pretty worth for once a while. After all, $12 for a coffeeshop setting, seems pricey.
Will patronize again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104230902325892800251/reviews
