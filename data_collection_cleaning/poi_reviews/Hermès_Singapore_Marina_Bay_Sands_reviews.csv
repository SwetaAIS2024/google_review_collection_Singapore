DR SG,5,"I recently visited the Hermes store at Marina Bay Sands and had an exceptional shopping experience. The store’s ambiance was luxurious and welcoming, offering a true sense of elegance.

A special mention goes to the salesperson, May, who provided outstanding service. She was incredibly professional, attentive, and knowledgeable about the products. May patiently guided me through the selection process, providing valuable insights and making thoughtful recommendations that perfectly suited my preferences.

Her warm and friendly demeanor made the entire shopping experience delightful. May went above and beyond to ensure I felt valued and comfortable throughout my visit. It’s rare to find such dedication to customer service, and she truly represents the high standards of Hermes.

If you’re visiting Hermes at MBS, I highly recommend seeking out May for a seamless and memorable shopping experience. I look forward to returning in the future!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116544865914211833721/reviews
Michelle Koh,5,"So glad to meet Catherine because I didn't thought that I would be able to bring any bag home when entering. Much to my surprise, I bought the bag I long wanted and Catherine goes the extra mile to help me in selecting the scarf and tie it. Will look for Catherine in future, very pleasant purchase.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113005302051880474302/reviews
Fritz A,5,"Izzati truly embodies what it means to deliver a world-class luxury experience. During my visit to the Hermès MBS store, she demonstrated exceptional patience and attentiveness, making me feel genuinely welcomed and understood from the moment I stepped in.

What impressed me most was her thoughtful and caring approach—not only did she offer valuable recommendations tailored to my own preferences, but she also provided insightful suggestions for my wife’s wardrobe when I asked for her opinion. Despite my wife not being present, Izzati considered her style and needs with impressive intuition and professionalism.

Her deep product knowledge, calm demeanor, and genuine care created an experience that felt personal, elevated, and memorable. Izzati is a shining example of service excellence and a true asset to Hermès.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101999164023573273663/reviews

I was looking for a scarf as a gift and Siti was incredibly patient in explaining and demonstrating different design and colors. She has very warm smile and sincere making me feel truly welcome.

It’s rare to come across such genuine hospitality, and this experience has made me want to return to the same outlet again. In the end I went out with 2 items :D
