      "text": "We visited Big Wine Freaks with my wife for date night and we had a most excellent experience. We chose the set course plus wine pairing which was provided by the Italian Wine Club in Singapore.  Every item on the menu was fresh, delicious, and prepared by the very talented chefs right in front of where we were sitting. I personally loved the Sashimi Mix, Mushroom Mix as well as the Beef Short Rib. The staff was extremely professional and friendly and the decor of the restaurant and overall vibe was amazing. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "Funky vibes, curated food, unique wines, and attentive service - this made our experience very enjoyable! I appreciate how the ingredients are carefully selected and prepared. The Japanese tomatoes were impressively sweet. The Hamachi was perfectly cut & seasoned. And the dessert tart was delicious. Really enjoyed their selection of wines, especially the Vanguard ones which were quite funky and unexpected. Removing 1 star for the price point.",

Food if more of tapas style so we decided to order a couple of things for sharing. Sashimi platter was fresh, beef was very tender and flavorful.\n\nWine list was not as extensive as I have expected for a wine bar. Overall experience has been quite nice for friends gathering.",

The staff was knowledgeable and the wine recommendations were spot on.\n\nHowever, service-wise, there is some room for improvement. During our visit, no one checked on us to see if everything was okay, which was a bit disappointing.\n\nDespite that, I would still recommend this wine bar . Looking forward to seeing improvements in service on my next visit.\n\nAlso shoutout to Negin, for taking care of us too!",
