      "text": "My child trained with them for over a year. The coaching was good when they were based at Turf City. However, after they relocated to the courts at Dover International School, we noticed a decline. The better coaches were no longer as present, and unfortunately, the overall quality and standard of coaching dropped, which was disappointing, especially given the high fees. Additionally, there seems to be a lack of passion among many of the coaches, with greater emphasis placed on competition teams rather than the general training groups. The only bright spot was Coach TY, who genuinely stood out as a coach worth training with, but sadly, our schedules did not align.",
