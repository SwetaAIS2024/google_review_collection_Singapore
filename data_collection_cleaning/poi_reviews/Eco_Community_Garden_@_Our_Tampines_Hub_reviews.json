It has no seat here, however, the view was ok. The place is opened for public, I don't know who can be authorised to plant things here.",

Children will enjoy seeing all the vegetables right on the plants. This is a great initiative by Our Tampines Hub and the residents of Tampines! Heard that the vegetables are given away to the residents.",

      "text": "My family visited the Eco-Community Garden at Level 5 of Tampines Hub today. Many spices, fruits and vegetables were planted in the Eco-garden. There are oregano, chin chow, red chilli padi, Aloe Vera, fig, lady's finger, chye sim, Chiku, lettuce, tomato, costus, pumpkin, mango, papaya, and many more which I can't recalled. It is a good place to visit with young children as they will be surprised to discover how the plants look in real life. It is a good bonding place for elderly to share their gardening knowledge with the young ones. Furthermore,  the Eco-garden was well maintained. Oh! I was told that the produce harvested will be used in culinary classes hosted at Tampines Hub. I hope the Eco-garden will sustain with the support of Tampines residents and visitors.  Well done.",
