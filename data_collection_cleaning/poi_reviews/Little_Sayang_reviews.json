As for the fries, not only were they soggy some were under cooked; you can tell from the photo that they arenâ€™t crispy.\n\nChicken Cutlet Nasi Lemak: rice, chilli paste and pickled cucumbers are normal. Ikan billis are crispy, the chicken cutlet okay.\n\nSorry to say I wonâ€™t come back again ðŸ˜…",

      "text": "I had previously eaten nasi lemak here and found their version too oily. Decided to give them a second shot.\n\nTried their satay, a mix of Chicken ($1.00 per stick) and Mutton($1.20 per stick). To my surprise they did not have ketupat at all. What surprised me more was when they took out the frozen satays from some plastic packaging that was definitely ordered from some supplier or central kitchen.\n\nMeat tough, chewy and lacking flavour. Avoid.\n\nAfter two tries, I will not be giving them a third try. Made my stomach act weird too.\n\nOf the multiple Satays available in Toa Payoh, this is surely the saddest. Go elsewhere where they make it homemade.",

I enjoyed the pasta dishes - a nice modification from its western cuisine origins. I asked for \"extra meat\" for my orders as they are most flavorful.",

Itâ€™s indeed tucked away in an industrial food canteen area - an obvious sign that the service/atmosphere wouldnâ€™t be that of a cafe/restaurant. I cannot understand why theyâ€™re getting poor reviews on the fish & chips though. Itâ€™s IMO the better ones in Toa Payoh (battered and crispy!). So itâ€™s a quiet place, business might not be that good. Do give them a try if youâ€™re around the area. Ignore the reviews and come try with an open mind.",
