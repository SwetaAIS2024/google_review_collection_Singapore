The food was served quite quickly. Didn‚Äôt order their chicken rice even though they‚Äôre known for that. Ordered the fish horfun instead. Not too bad. They added strips of ginger which I found interesting. Overall okay for lunch. Affordable and reasonable pricing as well.",

      "text": "We chanced upon this little no fuss outlet. It looked simple and clean. Owner and staff are friendly. Rice served is chicken rice ‚Äî cooked just right - not hard nor mushy. Crispy baby squids has good crunch with the right amount of caramelized coating. Mixed veggies was not overcooked. Lemon Chicken has a good portion of lightly-battered chicken fillet slices. They retained the crispiness too even though they were doused with tangy lemon sauce. All of us  of 3 different age groups (Above 80, Above 50 and Above 10 years of age) enjoyed this meal. Total bill came up to $40.55.\n\nToday, we are here again for dinner. Now managed to add in photos of the almost-the-same-ordered dishes except today, we had sambal kangkong and tofu with prawns. The kangkong was not clumpy nor too oily. There is still the crunch, hence not overcooked.\n\nTofu with prawns dish has good-sized prawns that are fresh. The sauce over the dish was done ‚Äúhor-fun‚Äù egg-based style. So if you enjoy the ‚Äúwet‚Äù/‚Äúsup kum‚Äù style, order this dish.\n\nConsistent good quality is important. Better still, the lady server still remembers us! üòÉ",
