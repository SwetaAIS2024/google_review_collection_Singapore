Dawn,5,"Nice and friendly yet professional staff and dentist. Very efficient and fast! Did general teeth cleaning, which is scaling and polishing, as well as two teeth fillings. The total cost was about $300, reasonable price as tooth fillings are higher priced anyway. Minimal discomfort during the procedure and also got clear explanations from the dentist. Can use cashless methods such as credit card PayWave. There's a water cooler available. I plan to come back for regular checks and cleanings.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107101897476917529085/reviews
Bluu,5,"Would highly recommend Dr Richard!

He did my wisdom teeth extraction, he explained all the options I could have, such as doing all 4 in one go or do 1 side at a time, and the pros and cons of each option. He lets me know I can raise my hand if I feel pain. The discomfort during procedure was bearable, his easy going nature and jokes make the exp more comfortable. Recovery was quite smooth, swelling was not noticeable at all if there was even any. The recovery pain was so bearable I didn't even use any painkillers.

For routine cleaning, he spots signs of teeth weakening, he is very good at educating on proper teeth and gum care, and how tooth decay happens, all this without any form of shame at all. Using shame and embarrassment is an awful and hurtful tactic used during school dentist visits in my childhood, I didn't dare to visit dentists for years, so I'm thankful now I always come back routinely thanks to Dr Richard!

Receptionist is also handles admin stuff and payment in a friendly manner!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108575493607172405079/reviews

Zephyr Khambatta,5,"I had the most amazing time removing two wisdom teeth with almost zero pain. I felt like a mosquito bite type of pain at a couple of points but that was it. I think Dr. Teo (Jian Kiat), was fantastic at explaining everything and making sure I felt super comfortable at every step! I’ll definitely come back here for more treatment. I think Dr. Teo and BoBo make a fantastic team! Regards, Zephyr",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101186575963410694602/reviews
Mia Silverwolf,5,I have been to Q&M since 2009 for extractions and my children’s appointments and each visit has been nothing but wonderful. The doctors and nurses were very patient with me and every visit I am educated on the dental procedures and the root causes of my dental issues.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104158961599063963489/reviews
