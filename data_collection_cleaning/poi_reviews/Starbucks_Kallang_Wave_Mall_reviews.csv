Constance Y,4,"Delightful and warm bagel, what made it even better was that it came with butter, cream cheese and jam. However, I did notice that the cafe was a bit warmer than expected and it seemed like the AC wasn't quite doing its job. Nonetheless, I appreciated the fact that it wasn't overly crowded, allowing me to unwind and relax after a hectic day.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114828186394594090722/reviews
Tricia Loh,2,"Barista was quite rude when we asked a question regarding a voucher. Not recommended if you want to spend time here for a long time. The place was not even crowded, not sure why they want to chase us out and even threatened to call police even though we left our things there for 30mins and came back for it.
