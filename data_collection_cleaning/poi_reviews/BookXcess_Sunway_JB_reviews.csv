kus popo,4,"My first time here, after seeing it on social media so often. The idea is not new but still impressive enough when seeing it with your own eyes.
I was there during the long weekend holiday, but still feel very spacious and not over crowded. There are probably more books for the young readers and children but I also saw a wide range of books for adults & topics.
Inside that impressive lighted bookshelf is a hidden ""book room"" for children. Even more impressive, it is 2 levels of hidden ""book room"". There's also a cafe (wolf cafe) in the corner and a piano by the window, surely anyone, young or old, can find their interest in this store, whether you like books or not.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100231466774373349791/reviews

Natasha Liman,4,"The books are very cheap and the interior is very pretty = instagrammable. The staff are helpful as well in helping us to find that you're looking for. However, the book collections are limited, a significant part of the collections are catered towards children and not a lot of science/technology non-fiction.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102397633516649975287/reviews
