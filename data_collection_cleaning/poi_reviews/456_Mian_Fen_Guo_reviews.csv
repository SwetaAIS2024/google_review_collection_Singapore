Sean Goh,3,"Tried this mee hoon kway stall that is very popular and constantly having long queue. Went early around 10am and there wasnt much of a queue. Price starts from SGD$4 for all types of noodle. They served both the dry and soup version. Dried noodle are tossed in dark soya sauce and comes with a bowl of soup.

Had the mee hoon kway dry, portion seems a little small. Texture of noodle was great, it was perfectly cooked and still retains the good texture.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Melvin Tay,5,"This home made noodle stall is indeed one of the tastiest in both dry or soup version ever. Homemade broth is superbly tasty with tangy noodle texture filled with aromatic minced pork and well seasoned mushroom in dark sauce.
The dry version is authentically tasty too.
Can’t deny further on how this stall upkeep it’s dish with consistency and added with pleasant service rendered.
For me rainy and cooling days - savoy in the soup version",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100911509802523186728/reviews
Stephanie C,5,Well worth the 30-min queue for this! Each piece had the perfect bite and chew to it. The accompanying chili sauce tasted more like the ones for chicken rice than mian fen guo though.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112652857005699672221/reviews

Daniel Tan,5,"Ordered the dry version, honestly speaking the best thing is the noodle itself!

soup and other condiments are quite normal

But worth coming here for the hand tear noodle, the just the pan mee itself without anything is already quite tasty.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105879306434357539012/reviews
