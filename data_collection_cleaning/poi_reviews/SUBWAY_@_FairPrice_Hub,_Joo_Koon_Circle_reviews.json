      "text": "I was very tired after work and noticed that your dining area was completely empty, with no customers at the time. I just needed a few minutes to sit and rest. I understand and fully respect that the seating is for customers only, and of course, if any paying customer had arrived, I would have moved immediately out of courtesy I do have manners.\n\nHowever, I felt a bit disheartened when the staff asked me to leave right away. I understand they may have been following instructions, possibly because their boss was watching, as one of them mentioned. Still, I believe that a little compassion goes a long way. I also noticed an older man who looked exhausted being asked to leave, which made me feel even more uneasy.\n\nThat said, I want to acknowledge that the Malay gentleman, the Indian lady, and the Indian man on your team were all friendly and respectful in their approach. I truly appreciate their kindness it made a difference.\n\nThank you for your attention to this feedback. I hope it's taken in the spirit of humanity and understanding.",

Veggies are fresh, serving is worth it (amongst the other branches in west that I visited so far)and staffs are quite welcoming, I like them, very friendly. Just that, the queue is really long on peak hours (well, all stores though), but still bearable. üëç",
