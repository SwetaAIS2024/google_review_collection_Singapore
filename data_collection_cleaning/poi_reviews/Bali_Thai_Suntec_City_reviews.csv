G A,3,"I dined at Bali Thai hoping for a proper Thai meal but left feeling disappointed. Their menu leans heavily towards Indonesian dishes, with only limited Thai options. To make things worse, the food was served cold, making it feel more like fast food than a proper dining experience. For the high prices, I expected much better quality and service. Unfortunately, it didn’t deliver on the authentic Thai dining experience I was craving, and it’s not a place I see myself returning to.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110239616130172309842/reviews

SK Ho,5,"Had an enjoyable dinner tonight. A wide variety of dishes to choose from. Prawns are fresh, big and juicy. Rest of the dishes are good and satisying too. We had pineapple rice and it came with sliced chinese sausage. Would be good if the outer skin of chinese sausage are peeled off.
On seevice, Staff are pleasant and friendly.
Nice environment with tables apart.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106052152130933399046/reviews
C T,4,"We had lunch at Bali Thai on a weekday. The team seemed a bit overwhelmed but manageable. The food was served quickly after ordering. The Tom Yum soup was a bit too light for me, and the fish was a bit too dry and hard to eat, but I liked the mango salad that came with the fish. Kang Kong and green curry was nice. The Red Ruby and mango sticky rice were below average.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113390811001221493323/reviews
