dq,4,"Very small outlet but at least they're organized. I'd come here if I wanted to avoid a crowd, more for groceries and dry goods. Fresh bakes would prefer to go to a higher turnover store.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114649758928693741649/reviews
Lindt MM,5,"Cold storage never fail to impress me. Well known for their motto,  “The Fresh Food People”. Everything look fresh & clean. Neatly stacked & clearly labelled. Wide range of snacks & chips. Staff is helpful when asked for assistance.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106081966351615781892/reviews
Craig Towers,3,Kind of a disjointed layout. The range is pretty basic but ok. If you get to the mall and can’t find it look up. It’s on floor 2. They definitely push self check out.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109402199938349198883/reviews
Benjamin Millar,4,A good all-round supermarket in the UE Square shopping mall.  It competes with the Meidi-Ya across the road - both start discounting their sushi & sashimi as the evening draws on.  It's not as large as its competitor and has a smaller deli because of it but stocks a wider range of more general groceries including some UK brands if you're an expat.  I noted they had a wider range of beer than across the road.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115021262746852080558/reviews
Soo Hin Yeoh,5,"This is a sizeable Cold Storage catering to the expat community around Robertson Quay, it has everything you need especially cheese, cold cuts, wines and bread from Swissbake.

As it’s located on L2 in a mall with low footfall, it’s usually a delight to shop there during pandemic as there is very few people. The only thing missing is perhaps some semi-cooked or cooked food.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115725392210756907778/reviews
