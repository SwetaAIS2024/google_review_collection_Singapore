Ja C,1,"It was advertised as a Tcm,  so I'm expecting their staff to have some basic knowledge of what they do, treatment or massages. Was initially skeptical and I'm glad I only paid for a 40 minutes foot massage to test it out. Told them that I've  a minor bump on my sole and would need a massage, the counter lady said I should drain blood from the sore which I'm glad I didn't!  Gosh.. The masseuse was just doing subpar massage that involves some pressing and some hitting. Told her to go harder and asked if she could rub on the aching spot, her response was oh I don't dare to because I'm not trained. She was also yawning away as she pressed and tickled my foot..  Erm, thanks.
I think my home osim machine gives a better massage.
Possibly one of the worst massages around.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110142901540695327258/reviews
