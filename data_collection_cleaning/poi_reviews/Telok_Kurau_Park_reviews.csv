Rhea,5,"My children really love this place. There's plenty of equipment, including 4 swings, a merry-go-round, wall climbing, a climbing frame, and a sandpit. It's very shady in the afternoon, and kids can also play football and basketball. It's the best neighborhood we've experienced so far. It's very safe as well because it's far from the road; it's next to the canal that connects to East Coast Park",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108494042356276555350/reviews

Vig Mail,5,"It’s not a large natural park like the reserves in India or Yosemite Park in the US. But it serves the young parents and their kids as it provides the space and greenery needed for folks to run around, play games, exercise and enjoy some quiet shade under trees and the gazebos around the park. There is an exercise area too for those inclined to work out more than chill out but the rest of us are likely to use the park benches littered around. There is one stretch of tarmac connecting the canal (which runs along one side of the park) to the side road on the other side of the park. I’m assuming it’s for fire engine access or general official traffic. It’s a lively space in the mornings, late afternoons and evenings. Especially on the weekends.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104543753463741058163/reviews
