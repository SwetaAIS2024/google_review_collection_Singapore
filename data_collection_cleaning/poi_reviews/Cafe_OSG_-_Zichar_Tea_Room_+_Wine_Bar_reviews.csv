Jessica Lee,5,"The food was delicious and we especially enjoyed their hotpot with tea-infused broths. As a tea lover, their prebiotic kombucha tea blends were right up my alley. üçµ

There are both indoor and alfresco dining, with dices and cards on the table.. nice place to unwind after work.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100560834945941691426/reviews

jayden,4,"Definitely a 5 stars for it's atmosphere to chill and cleanliness of the restaurant. Came here a couple of times wanted to chill for a drink or 2 and end up being here for more than 5hrs and had many multiple orders of beers.
The beers here is fresh, the Sapporo is one of the fresher draft beers which is always constantly fresh for these few times.
I quite like the beef rendang lunch set too, easy to eat, meat is quite soft too. The hokkien mee is average, abit on the salty side.
Good place for meetings, gatherings or chillouts. The Aircon is good too even on a hot sunny day, the restaurant is still cooling, sometimes even over too cold especially when it rains.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
