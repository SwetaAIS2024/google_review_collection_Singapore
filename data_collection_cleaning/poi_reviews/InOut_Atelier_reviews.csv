Deon Lim,5,"Hands down, best terrarium building experience led by in-house experts.
Chanced upon this place on Google Maps, and decided to give it a try after seeing the numerous 5-star reviews. Was not disappointed as we had a great time learning about mosses, how to care for them and the basics of terrarium landscaping. The founder, Ming Kuang, is a humorous and down to earth terrarium expert who will guide you through the building process patiently. After 2 hours, you’ll head home with a handcrafted masterpiece and pleasant memories.
While location is not the most convenient, there are many cafes nearby for you to build a day’s worth of itinerary around.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116562411734764130577/reviews
Bill Ye,5,"My experience at InOutAtelier has been remarkable, the owner was patient, friendly and welcoming. He was more than willing to answer my inquires, about the different types of terrariums, how to take better care of the terrariums, the workshops they offer and, how he started up his company from scratch, was also inspiring.
The terrarium that i had purchased was a perfect idea for a gift as well, and it looked incredible! Overall, it was one of the best customer interactions I’ve had so far and it was worth every penny I’ve spent, did not regret my purchase! :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103135093313153981941/reviews
