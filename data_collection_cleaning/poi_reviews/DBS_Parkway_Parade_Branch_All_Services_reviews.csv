Shanta Kesavan,2,"The queue management at DBS Parkway is appalling. A couple of weeks ago my daughter who works abroad asked for assistance to open an account. The male staff brushed off and told her to use the scanner and online. She  found that it was not as direct or simple as in her case.  If he took time to listen, he could have saved alot of hassle for her.
Personally,  I  find some of the staff are not happy to do this particular job, they are impatient especially with senior customers and clueless in managing skill. It's always chaotic at the entrance even when it's not busy! I have had better customer service at other branches of DBS.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111158374893246466411/reviews

She was incredibly patient and helpful throughout the entire process. Wei Ching explained everything clearly and answered all my questions thoroughly. She made the account opening process smooth and efficient.
