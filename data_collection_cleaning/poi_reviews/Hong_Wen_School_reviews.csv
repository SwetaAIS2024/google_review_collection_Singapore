Regine Tan,1,A very bad school that only seems to care about grades.My daughter gets bullied and a regular class has 10 bullies! Though already reported to the school the form teachers did not even care at all! Only untill I reported to the teachers then they cared only a bit about my daughter. Highly discouraged to join as the school is like invested with bullies.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112874771229019511946/reviews
