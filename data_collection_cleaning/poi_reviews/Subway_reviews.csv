brandalyn loo,5,"Got a quick bite at Subway before running errands. I was not expecting much. However, it turned out to be the best subway I have ever had. The honey oat bread was toasted to perfection and the staff was generous with the fillings. Enjoyed every bite. Would definitely come back to this Subway again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100615878020894709715/reviews
