KYQH,5,"A while ago, I had an unexpected visitor—a bat flew into my house and ended up injured. Not knowing what to do, I reached out to NParks, and they responded quickly and professionally. Their team provided clear guidance and ensured the bat received the proper care it needed. It was truly reassuring to see their dedication, knowledge, and care for wildlife in action.

Singapore is lucky to have an organisation like NParks, not just for maintaining our beautiful green spaces but also for looking after the creatures that share our environment. Even with my busy schedule, I wanted to take a moment to appreciate their hard work. If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, do not hesitate to contact NParks—they truly go above and beyond!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117304730385787834747/reviews
Taj Imran,5,Many thanks to the 2 NParks staff who swung by within 10 mins to remove a baby snake that I discovered in my backyard (Holland Grove View). And also for answering all my questions and alleviating my fears. I didn't get their names but you guys are lifesavers.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110861713843586688153/reviews

Silvia Foralosso,5,"Today I got home and found a snake on top of my kitchen..I rushed to inform the condo security/management and called straight away NParks to ask their support..the lady who answered me in the first place was super nice and tried to calm me down, got my details and address and told me I would get a call from a colleague soon..in 10 min another officer called me to confirm the address and informed that an expert would be on his way to my place soon. He actually got in touch with me while on the way , ask for pictures of the snake and tried to calm me down..after 30 min Shannon and Lester showed up at my place, caught the snake and put it safely in a box! What an amazing service! So efficient and professional! Thanks to the whole NParks team and huge thanks to Lester and Shannon!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100246563829025427930/reviews
Jia Ing Neo,1,"I have come across nparks trapping birds for the purpose of killing them right beside the hawker centres under the name of “bird management”. This is such an ineffective and short term policy if this is how you want to prevent birds flying to the leftover food. The source of the problem which is the food disposal should be the issue that you tackle, not the killing of these birds that are instinctively looking for food. Please change the method of doing things rather than killing these poor animals (birds, boars) anytime issues arise.

You can try strategies like covering food tray return areas/ensuring secure nettings (because some of the hawker centres that have nettings are not secure due to improper sealing) etc.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100878689846663193484/reviews
