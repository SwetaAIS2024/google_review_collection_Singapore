      "text": "Dr Teo is a very patient oncologist (although he look a bit fierce initially). During my recent conversation with him, he slowly explain all the cancer medical stuff, good and bad… and even advise which is the most suitable option, after considering my health condition, financial and gave me a lot of good advice. He did not rush thru the conversation and help me analyze all the points.. and I think we chat for 20 mins.. until I fully understand everything. appreciate his time and make me feel taken care of..\n\nTruly a very passionate dr who cares for patients wholeheartedly. Highly recommend 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",

      "text": "Good oncologist in jb. 👍🏻👍🏻\n\naccompanied a friend who desperately need to see a cancer specialist after getting her scan results. We didn’t manage to get appointment on the same day to see dr through official contact.. but decided to just walk in to try luck. Clinic was very full with patients but all the nurses were helpful. They tried their best to accommodate us to meet dr, in the meanwhile assuring my friend who was very worried and crying.\n\nAfter waiting for 2 hours, we managed to meet Dr Teo. he reassured my friend and telling her not necessary to go for advanced treatments which costs a lot. He can plan the treatment to be equally effective within her financial capability and insurance coverage.. also explain a lot of cancer myths that we are worried about.\n\nReally appreciate it for making time to meet us and not rush through the consultation eventhough we did not have an appointment slot. Thank you, Dr teo, farah and other nurse (forgot her name). 🥹🥹",

      "text": "I am not a patient of Dr Teo. Because he is in JB and I am in KL. But one time I accidentally saw his video on Xiaohongshu. It happened that my sister was suffering from lung cancer adenocarcinoma. We don’t know or understand many things. Dr Teo’s video gave us a lot of practical suggestions and tips to help us understand what we should ask my sister’s attending doctor. There are also things to pay attention to before and after treatment... Later, our whole family followed him, and he gave us many suggestions on how to take care of cancer patients...\n\nThank you, dr teo! 🙏",
