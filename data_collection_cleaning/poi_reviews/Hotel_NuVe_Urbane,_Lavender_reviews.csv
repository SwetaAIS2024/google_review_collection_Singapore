Shanti Javadekar,5,"I loved my stay at this hotel. I loved the housekeeping, the location, and the kind staff. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. Just one thing to note: the rooms are small but comfortable for one person and are very well-maintained. If you need a safe, clean, and comfortable stay and are traveling alone, this hotel could be an option.

Looking forward to staying here again someday.üòä‚ù§Ô∏èüôèü§û",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111589236135993947834/reviews
Sofia Olivia,5,"hotel facilities were good. room was spacious with ample amount of space to eat (on the floor) despite not having a chair.

service was excellent, staff was accommodating and friendly.

location wise could be better as it‚Äôs about a 8-10 min wall from lavender MRT. hotel was discreet - somewhere behind HDB block 1 but otherwise quite easy to find as it‚Äôs right beside the bar",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112536090641521745506/reviews
Â•™Êúà ÂÑ™,4,"Clean rooms but one thing I don't like is balcony facing a block of flats.
The shampoo and body cleanser seems abit diluted and I had to use more of each.
Cleaner is nice to write a note to inform his shift will end at 3pm, sorry about that as I'm too tired so slept way past noon.
Short walk to hotel from bus stop and sheltered walkway from mrt station.
Free biscuits snacks beside reception and great service from staffs.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106229036625964621134/reviews
Kristien Keown,4,"This hotel was a bit on the dated side and clearly hadn‚Äôt been renovated in a long time. The room itself appeared clean, just not the nicest room. Room was fairly small and didn't have a lot of space for two people. Bed was adequate, but pillows weren‚Äôt very comfortable nor were the sheets. The pool area looked quite different than the pictures. It was pretty small and not maintained great as the wall seemed ‚Äòunclean‚Äô and chairs were scattered about. It felt a bit squished into the space. Hotel was conveniently located from metro station.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117129836968985330119/reviews
Andrea Tichborne,1,"My room suffered from condensation - the walls on the 5th night were literally crying. Reception was quick to send maintenance however he says open the window but this was impossible as it was locked - he checked and couldn‚Äôt so he turned my aircon down to 16 degrees, mopped the walls dry and did not respond to me saying carpet was damp as was my bed and bag. I turned air con up as who can enjoy 16 degrees! Reception was ok but not interested after initial check in. My cleaner was awesome - she was so kind. I wouldn‚Äôt stay again - pay a bit more and get a room that does not suffer from condensation and damp. I also bought ear plugs to stop the noise although they advertise quiet.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100755277421639784067/reviews
