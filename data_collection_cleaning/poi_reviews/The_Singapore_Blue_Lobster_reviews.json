      "text": "Dudes, you are over extending your menu. If you guys can't handle the vast amount of dishes, cut down your menu.\n\nIt's unacceptable that everyone is waiting around for your food. We waited 1hr and 15mins for a breakfast. Had to chase you guys 3 times and you didn't even know where the order was.\n\nI was just one out of the many angry customers.\n\nIn the end, my sando was delayed even later than the breakfast and still got the wrong sando I ordered.\n\nBreakfast was super oily, you paper below was not suitable and tore together with the bread. Its not pleasant. Taste was alright.\n\nTaste\nBreakfast 2.5/5 (prawn version. Too oily, paper tore.)\nSando 2/5 (2 slices of bread with meat ain't worth 10.90)\n\nWon't be back. Wish yall the best though.",

The standout dish was definitely the Beef Galbi Tacos â€“ a must-try! I also really enjoyed the scrambled eggs from the American Big Breakfast. Overall, it was a good experience, enhanced by the lovely vibes and charming pink decor.",

The oysters they sold were relatively fresh which saved it from a 1 star rating.\n\nWould not recommend the lobster roll at all.",
