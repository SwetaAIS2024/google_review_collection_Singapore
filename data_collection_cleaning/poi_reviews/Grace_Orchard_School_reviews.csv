Eunice Koh,1,"Supposedly a SPED school but will pick and choose their own students to make their lives easier and only accept students with neurotypical behaviors. Demands for more documentation than is needed for the already-convoluted MOE SPED school application process, only to choose to ignore all reports in favor of a deeply-flawed 2-day admission screening that even a layperson not trained in psychology would know is statistically skewed. Completely unethical and goes against the basic ethos of education that puts the MOE fraternity to shame.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101428588084246815530/reviews
