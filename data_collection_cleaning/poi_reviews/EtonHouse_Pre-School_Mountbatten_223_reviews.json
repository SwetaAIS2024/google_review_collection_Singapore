      "text": "EtonHouse Mountbatten 223 will always have the most special place in my heart. My son will be graduating at the end of this year and as much as he will miss the school, I will most definitely miss it more! From the parent liaison team to the teachers, theyâ€™ve all become such a huge part of our days and I like to consider them my little extended family. For 4 years weâ€™ve had teachers listen to our concerns and come up with solutions as a team. Weâ€™ve seen our son grow into a confident and articulate little boy, a beautiful sight to see. ðŸ¥¹ The school has prepped my son emotionally and academically and this will definitely help him enter the local primary school system with no issues. Iâ€™ll always be grateful to the team at EtonHouse for creating a holistic environment filled with their love, joy and care.",

      "text": "I cannot recommend 223 Etonhouse highly enough! From the moment we enrolled our child, we have seen tremendous growth in his confidence, social skills, and love for learning. The caring teachers truly go above and beyond, fostering a nurturing environment where each child feels valued and supported.\n\nThe curriculum is thoughtfully designed, balancing play with educational activities that engage the children and spark their curiosity. Our child comes home excited to share what he learned each day, and itâ€™s clear that the staff genuinely cares about each childâ€™s development.\n\nAdditionally, 223 Etonhouse offers incredible value for money. The quality of education and care provided far exceeds our expectations. We feel fortunate to be part of such a wonderful community. Thank you to everyone at 223 Etonhouse for making this such a positive experience for our family!",
