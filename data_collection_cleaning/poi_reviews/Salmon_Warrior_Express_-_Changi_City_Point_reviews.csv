see you latté,4,"Paid S$13.10 for Cheesezilla Chick Don S$11.90 (staff packed veggies separately according to request) and an additional onsen egg S$1.20. Mixing onsen eggs to the rice and nicely grilled, flavorful meat elevated the taste even more. Overall experience was okay.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109562020139406369328/reviews
bryan tan,1,"For the price we paid, this is measly portion. They even sliced a cherry tomato into half. But anyway, the salmon was fresh but way too little. The rice was clumpy too. Wouldn’t return even if it’s 20% off selected bowls.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104632911289360286356/reviews
S.Y,4,"Order 2 Donburi home and saw that they have just recently open

Had the Beef & Chick Don $12.72 (UP$15.90) they had a 20% discount which was decent and yummy.

Also the Kuro Kusho Don $9.90 which is Seared Salmon slices that came with green lettuce, cherry tomatoes, onsen egg.

Had the choice to pick a base and we had the Sushi Rice however it did not taste like it at all, it was actually just plain rice, a bit disappointed",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103878295994654326123/reviews
jetwilldash,2,"Food wise it taste good.

However what I do not like it is the so called ‘fake’ advertisement for the 20% off for weekday lunch/dinner.

When asked I was told 20% is for the add on sides only not for any rice bowls.

I don’t think I am the first person to experience this.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112727197931683289301/reviews
Jacqueline Tan,1,"Salmon was mushy and definitely not fresh. Very small portion for the price of $15. Miso soup was very sour, even the rice was bland and not sushi rice. Service was also very slow for an express stall. Basically nothing was right about the dish. Will never buy from them again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113453772970020993265/reviews
