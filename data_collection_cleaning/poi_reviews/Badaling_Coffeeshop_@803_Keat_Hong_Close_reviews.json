But Less food choice with inconsistent food quality at economical rice which beginning was good with the right chef. bad attitude staff in HK Roast. I would rather go Keat Hong Market for better food quality. Good part only lots of seats avaliable with good zi char, malay food, tender fresh and king of fried rice.",
