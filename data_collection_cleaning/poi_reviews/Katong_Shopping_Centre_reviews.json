      "text": "Katong Shopping Centre may be an old mall that had been around for decades since I was a kid but is still going strong. I appreciate how their car park lots have been widened. The indoor food court Gourmet Centre at basement one is fantastic with famous stalls like the chicken rice stall. It also has many legitimate and trusted maid agencies, and we are grateful for our foreign domestic worker coming from one of the agencies here. Even has a charming aquarium too. Will be back! üôèüèª",
