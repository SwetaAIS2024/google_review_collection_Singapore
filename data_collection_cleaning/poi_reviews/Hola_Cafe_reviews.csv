카트리나,1,"I had the same experience as the reviewer named Vision Discs. The lady at the vegetarian shop was extremely rude, and I’m very disappointed with the service. All I did was politely ask for some gravy on my beehoon, but she gave me a disapproving look as if I had done something wrong. I was charged $5.80, yet I received such poor and unfriendly treatment. I don’t believe any customer deserves to be treated this way, especially when we are paying for our food. The owner of this shop should really look into this matter and ensure that customers are treated with basic courtesy and respect.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101623651304554289564/reviews
Yvonne lsy,1,"It's the first time I've eaten this kind of ramen. It's completely tasteless. If the stall owner still wants to do business, please follow up with your employees in time and try your food.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111510328915028353126/reviews
Princess Mania,3,Had the signature minced pork mushroom meepok $4.80. Forgot to inform the staff to reduce the vinegar in the noodle. Would hv enjoyed my  meepok more if it wasn't for the vinegar. The 2 pieces of pork lard was soft n not fragrant. The noodle n ingredient portions were adequate.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107320587807657797918/reviews
Amanda Chen,1,"The economical rice store at the very end of the food court was atrocious. The server was picking up the ingredients I selected while talking loudly to the customer at the back.

The food he was chewing in his mouth flew into my takeaway box which was left unnoticed by him. I was charged $3.60 for food that has to be thrown away due to bad hygiene.

Too disgusted by this experience and would never patronise this economical rice store again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113722986083260607977/reviews
