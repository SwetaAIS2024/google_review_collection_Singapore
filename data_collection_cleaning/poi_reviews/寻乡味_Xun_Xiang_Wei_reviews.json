      "text": "Located in Rong Fa Coffee Shop.\n\nPrice: $4.50 (Lei Cha Brown Rice)\n\nThe ingredients of the Lei Cha (Thunder Tea Rice) includes fried bean curd, sweet chye poh (preserved radish bits), long beans, stir fried cabbage, mani cai (sweet leaf), chye sim, toasted peanuts and ikan bilis (dried anchovies). Tea soup is basil based and is quite savoury.\n\nLoved the addition of the ikan bilis which provides more crunch and savouriness.\n\nCame at around 12 and was served immediately.\n\nDo come support the lesser known dishes in Singapore!",
