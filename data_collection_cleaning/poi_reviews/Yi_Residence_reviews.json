We have our lo-hei which is quite unique in itself, unlike the typical restaurants.   We enjoyed the dishes & Pen-Cai by Chef Eric.  With a party of 9, throughly enjoyed the experience of private fine dining.",

      "text": "Had dinner there yesterday. The A4 Waygu which was my main was cooked perfectly. It was juicy, tender and beefy. Enjoyed it very much. The wife had the cod which was great as well. I'm not usually a fish person, but I have to say it is something that I would want to go back again for.\nDessert was bird's nest. Tasted as good as it looked. Not overly sweet which was great.\nThe best dish for me though was the starter. We had a pumpkin bisque that came with a seafood wonton that was topped with a clam. It was fresh and had a lovely texture to it. Would definitely recommend it.",

Service was excellent and we received lots of support on the back end in terms of seating arrangements and drinks. The events were a success and I would recommend everyone to book with them. ☺️",
