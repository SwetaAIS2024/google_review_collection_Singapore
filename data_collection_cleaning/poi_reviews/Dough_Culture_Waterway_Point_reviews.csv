Scott,3,"We like the youtiao from this outlet compared to those from the surrounding coffee shops etc. The old auntie is really nice and patient. She always pack our purchases nicely in the plastic bag. There’s only once a young lady that served us, tried to give us an overly deep fried youtiao (really dark brown in color) that even all the previous customers ahead of us kept rejecting. We also have to be insistent for her to finally replaced the “charred” youtiao with properly deep fried ones. She’s really trying very hard to get rid of that overly “charred” youtiao. We also compared the Curry Puff against their directly opposite Old Chang Kee Curry Puff. We still prefer the Old Chang Kee Curry Puff even though it is way more expensive cos the Dough Culture Curry Puff skin is a little to “thick” and the potatoes is more like a paste plus it has a stronger chili powder taste which if not to our preference. The usual sweet potato slice, tapioca cake, yam cake, carrot cake etc. are all not bad. Good snacks to go with your kopi.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102640518090043652928/reviews

oXRYSTALo Ong,4,"I recently had the pleasure of revisiting Dough Culture at Waterway Point after its reopening from renovation. As I made my way back to the office from a meeting, I couldn't resist stopping by to indulge in some of their delectable treats. One of my all-time favorites, the TAU SUAN W/ CUT YOUTIAO. The combination of the warm and comforting tau suan with the crispy and freshly cut you tiao was a perfect blend of textures and flavors. It's no wonder why this dish has always been a standout for me.

In addition to my favorite tau suan with cut you tiao, I also decided to try out some other items on the menu. The spring roll was crispy and packed with flavorful fillings, while the pumpkin cake and yam cake added a unique twist to my snack selection. Each item was freshly prepared and served with care, showcasing Dough Culture's commitment to quality and taste.

The reopening of Dough Culture brought with it a renewed sense of excitement and freshness to the stall. The ambiance was inviting, and the staff were welcoming and attentive. Despite the hustle and bustle of the reopening, the service was efficient, and I was able to enjoy my snacks without any delay.

Overall, my experience at Dough Culture post-renovation was nothing short of delightful. The familiar flavors of my favorite tau suan with cut you tiao, coupled with the new additions to my snack lineup, made it a memorable visit. If you're looking for a place to satisfy your cravings for traditional dough snacks in a welcoming environment, Dough Culture at Waterway Point is the place to be. I highly recommend trying out their offerings for a tasty and satisfying treat that will leave you craving for more.

This combined review encapsulates both my previous experience at Dough Culture @ Waterway Point and my recent visit after the reopening, highlighting the consistency in quality and the joy of indulging in their delicious treats.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews

Zachia Low,2,"Always bought Dough Culture youtiao from waterway point outlet as it holds its crisp over long hours. Over past few attempts, notice youtiao is not as crispy as before and becomes soft and tough after awhile. Today's purchase even worse. So tough and soggy to bite. No difference from other mainstream stalls.. So disappointing that it doesn't sustain it's standard.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111367871906446824063/reviews
