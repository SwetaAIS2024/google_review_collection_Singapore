Terrence, the manager, was attentive & super friendly even after we did not hit the minimum spending for the discount. Appreciate his sincerity. Definitely coming back for another bowl soon!",

Most enjoyable part of the meal is the friendliness of Crystal, the service ambassador. She was very welcoming and warm the moment we stepped into the restaurant. She recommended the dishes and we tried and we loved them! She will come and check on us to ensure that we are enjoying our meal. The celery crush drink and the new ice cream dessert are worth trying. Thank you for your impeccable service,Crystal! ",
