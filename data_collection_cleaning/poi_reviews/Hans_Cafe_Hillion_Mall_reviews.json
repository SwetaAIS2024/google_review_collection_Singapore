Plus, this newly renovated branch looks so inviting.\n\nUnfortunately, the $4.20 pie was served cold and fell short of expectations. The crust was dry, and the banana filling could be more aromatic.\n\nSurprisingly, my accompanying Kopi C was actually better than expected. I may return to try other cooked dishes next time.",
