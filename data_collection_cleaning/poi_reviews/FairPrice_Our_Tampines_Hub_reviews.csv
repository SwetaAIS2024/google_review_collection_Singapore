Besharps,5,Quite a huge supermarket located at the basement of Tampines Hub. There are lots of items around the store and it is 24 hours which is pretty nice. There are also bento boxes at the entrance that you can buy. It's clean and well maintained and a lot of products on discounts. 👍 The self check out worked well too.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111020676081888304196/reviews
