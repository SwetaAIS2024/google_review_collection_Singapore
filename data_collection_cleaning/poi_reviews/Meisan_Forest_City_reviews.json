      "text": "Missed the Peking Duck at the old Meisan restaurant in Hotel Mutiara, so when I heard abt the Forest City outlet, I was excited. But, excitement turned into huge disappointment.\n\nReached there and was told no more Peking Duck, coz they only prepared 3 ducks per day. 1st red flag, coz which restaurant prepares only 3 ducks per day?But I decided to stay, since I missed the food there.\nI was so wrong.\n\nWe were the only ones in the restaurant at 7pm on Fri,  which was dinner time.\n2nd red flag.\n\nThe lady captain recommended a special pumpkin based soup with fresh Soon Hock.\nshe did not show us the weight or size of fish before cooking.\n3rd red flag.\n\nThe soup was nice and the fish meat was fresh.\n\nAlso ordered a veggie dish not listed inside the menu and the portion was so small, though it was medium size and ordered a ma po toufu.\n\nThe shock came when I went to pay. The total bill came up to RM462, which was a shocker, as I never expected the fish soup alone costs more than RM300.\n\nSo sadly, this would be my last time at Meisan.",

This restaurant deserves more love.\n\nFood: Beef was tender and brinjal was tasty.\nAtmosphere: Clean and bright\nPrice: RM 30-50 per pax\n\nHope they will turn on the aircond when more people dine in their restaurant.",

They really deserve to have more guests. It‚Äôs a pity not many people come to this beautiful place. It will be tough if not enough visitors, hotel guests, patronize this lovely city. It will be difficult to survive without customers. Do visit here and eat here if you can. Nice food and atmosphere.",
