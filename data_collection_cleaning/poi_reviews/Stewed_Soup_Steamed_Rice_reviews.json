Old cucumber pork ribs soup $3.50\n2. Salted veg duck soup $4.50\n3. Snow pear, sea coconut pork ribs soup $4\n4. Sichuan veg pork ribs soup $4\n5. Meat patty steamed rice $3.80\n6. 梅菜扣肉饭 $3.80\n7. Steamed carp fish head with black bean sauce $14\n\nSoups were perfectly steamed with super soft ingredients and very flavourful soups. Rice is also delicious mixed with tasty sauce and generous toppings. Fish is steamed to order, big piece, very fresh and full of tender flesh.\n\nGreat choice for rainy weather!",

      "text": "Super value for money in today’s context where prices are high everywhere. Quality stewed boiled soup with generous ingredients for as low as 3.50 to 5+ per portion. Their steamed rice is also highly recommended! It’s 5 stars in terms of value and I strongly suggest you come down to sims vista market and try it. They open around 1.30pm and will close on Sunday. Usually from 1.30-2.30pm there will be queue and some items will run out after 3pm.\n\nThis time we ordered 2x stewed soup, steam egg, sliced fish and claypot chicken rice. Total cost 21+ for so many dishes we had. Their steamed egg is really delicious too :) I think there’s better claypot rice than what they have here but for this pricing it’s still ok.\n\nWhen I come to hawker with lower spending, I don’t think atmosphere is an important criteria so my rating does not take into account of environment and ambience.",
