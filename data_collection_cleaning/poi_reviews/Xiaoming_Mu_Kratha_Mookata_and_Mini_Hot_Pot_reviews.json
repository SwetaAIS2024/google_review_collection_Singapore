The fire was able to last through my meal for close to 30 min. Would definitely come back to try the real mookata next time! Just a small feedback for the chilli sauce, its on the sweet side, would be good to balance with some acidity like lime or vinegar so more refreshing as a dip for the cooked ingredients.",

      "text": "Ulu hawker centre jalan batu is a happening place now!!\n\nAnother exciting new stall in this hawker, stall manned by friendly owners specialising in mini hotpot & mookata. With 3 broth and various meats/seafood to choose from. We got beef set for $9.80 each with chicken broth & tom yam broth. Each set comes with variety of fresh ingredients.\n\nThey should be very proud of their soup base cause it's heavenly good. We had high praise for the chicken broth. It's excellently brewed with strong herbal taste. Also, tom yum broth was good too, not too sour but spicy. Very ÈÄÇÂêàÊàë‰ª¨ÁöÑÂè£Âë≥.\n\nWe throw in all the ingredients except beef & egg. Let it cook for a few mins and absorb the tasty broth. Soak the beef for a few second and enjoy the softy beef. Taste like shabu shabu, so delicious! Lastly, pop the egg and have a yummy onsen egg.\n\nAnd YES, Ê±§Â∫ïÁöÑÈáëÂçé make us finish the soup till the very last drop. What a great meal!! Definitely worth a trip!!\n\nüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã",
