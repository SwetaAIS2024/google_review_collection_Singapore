      "text": "This is a hidden gem and easily one of the best western food in the East! A1 Family Ayam Goreng has been operating for the past few decades and they serves good old school western food which you hardly see nowadays.\n\nFirst is their panda rice with chicken wings, the rice is well cooked as it is fluffy, fragrant and flavourful! The chicken wings are heavenly good! It is nicely seasoned, the skin was crispy and the inside is very juicy and tender! Totally loving it!\n\nNext is the mixed grill! The chicken chop was so tender, juicy and very well seasoned! Lamb chop is superb! No gamy smell! Very well seasoned and the meat part was soooo tender and juicy! ü§§ the proteins definitely goes well with the homemade sauce which was very fragrant and it taste so different from those stall who uses ‚Äúpowder‚Äù sauce.\n\nLast but not leas, their FRIED BUNS! which hardly see nowadays was sooo nice!!!! The outside layer was crispy and inside was hot and fluffy! Totally nostalgic!\n\nWill surely return to eat again!",

      "text": "$7.50 lemon chicken chop. Chicken is crispy on the outside albeit a bit dry on the inside. Meat detaches from the batter as you cut it. Coleslaw is good! The portion of fries is on the small side. Nothing to comment on the baked beans - standard from the can. Would have preferred the bread to come with butter. Overall, not bad considering price point.",

      "text": "One of the best, if not the best western food stall in Tampines! Why? Simply based on the chicken chop and chicken cutlet, what you are getting is VALUE & TASTY with their homemade sauces! Especially the coleslaw is made fresh and served cold. the chicken cutlet is CRISPY and cooked just right with a wonderful batter and marinade, the chicken chop simply speaking is above average!\n\nThe only bad food that we ate was the mala chicken tenders, which to be fair is a very new item and perhaps they haven‚Äôt got it right yet. Nonetheless, the basics are there and exceeded all expectations",
