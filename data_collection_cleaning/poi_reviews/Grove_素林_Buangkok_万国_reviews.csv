Frosty Autumn,5,"Super ulu but worth the trip!
Staff was friendly and she also told me that Grove might remove the sandwich from the menu?! But it’s so good?! Grove boss if you see this, please don’t remove from menu. Maybe sell it at Paya Lebar outlet. I’ll go there more often ;)",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108480573876840211171/reviews

Grab delivery for dinner:
1. hainanese pork chop - too much rice, 8x fries, small pork chop, tomato sauce separately packed. Missing peas.
2. laksa - separately packed meetaimak and soup. 3 taopok, some mushroom, one egg and a few strands of beans sprout.

Tasty, if not a little salty.

Ordered via food panda at 1130am Sun received at 1210pm.
Bolo egg luncheon arrived warm in paper boxes. The sticker seals were hard to break. Tasted as good as ever. Found the portion very generous.
The yam cake with chili sauce slapped on the side, came steaming hot in a double deck paper bottom container with its sweet sauce in a plastic top container cover (regrettable packaging and no option to remove chilli).

Now that grove is here in NE, we don’t have to go to singpost paya lebar. It’s got the same menus, and there’s ample carpark and seating in Aircon!

The old fave hainan curry chicken rice is welcomed here and tastes just as good. New dishes beef noodles and unagi noodles were surprisingly tasty. Also tried the delicious cheese/egg/luncheon bolo and sardine puff - happy with the menu variety.
Good portion and decent pricing.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106223395921756091650/reviews

Claire Leaw,2,"I used to always have my breakfast here after dropping my kid off to his preschool. Their breakfast toast set used to be above average. However, the standard has dropped even since, the toast is thin and dry now, soft boiled eggs are overcooked most of the time. Now, I would rather pay $3 more to have my breakfast at Toastbox/Yakun/HeavenlyWang.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833273504290378991/reviews
