I had the earl grey matcha and it was bomb.com.  You can really tell how much care and precision goes into every cup. Service is warm, intimate and genuineâ€”it feels more like visiting a friendâ€™s kitchen than a business. Highly recommend if you love matcha, or just want something a little different.",

Tried the unique thai milk tea matcha latte, and it didnâ€™t disappoint (was surprisingly a nice combi)ðŸ˜‹ If you like cinnamon, can go for the honey cinnamon matcha latte which is slightly sweeter but itâ€™s a nice blend without overpowering the matcha flavor!\n\nDefinitely worth a try if you are nearby the area, wish I stayed closer ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜†",
