      "text": "Came here to try the hairy crab since it is in season. Ordered the set meal which we felt was worth it. Each dish is well executed but wished they had served the dishes in order for the food to stand out more eg appetiser first and mains before dessert. Wait staff were attentive and even helped us with the crabs. Crabs were good with lots of roe. As usual, Putien provides really good comfort food like the white Lor Mee and sweet & sour pork.  The great chilli sauce is their secret weapon above the competition as it elevates each dish to the next level.",
