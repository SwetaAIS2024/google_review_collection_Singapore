Tube inserted competently by Nurse Siti. She put everyone at ease. Very reassuring .  My husband was able to continue with his feed without delay. Thank you CMY.",

I find Dr Lau to be a very dedicated and detailed doctor. He will share with us his detailed diagnosis and provide us with our options. If there is any problems with Mom, he is just a call away and will rush down if urgent. He even answered our call at 3am when Mom was having  some problems. I deeply appreciate the help of Dr Lau and his nursing team and would like to compliment them.",
