T L,4,"Not bad but not amazing. Butter was too thin, baguette was quite dry actually. Coffee latte is good, but a bit too thick. please get kosong because it is naturally sweetened. I think they use 3-in-one coffee mix for this.

Wonâ€™t be back though Abigail service is very good. Super friendly.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105491523268870269764/reviews
Elizabeth Elisha Ms Kueh,5,"It's been a long time since I had a good breakfast set. Their toasted bread w kaya and butter is amazingly good and cheap.

I don't take French loaf usually, but I ate theirs! It was very crispy on the outside and tender in it.

Their coffee taste really fragrant and has the traditional scent. Not bitter at all.

Their staffs are very polite and nice too!

Definitely a place I'll recommend!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116463728634826205226/reviews
Jd L,4,"Came here to try. Relatively new food centre. Premises are clean. Order kopi o kosong, toast, french toast eggs. French toast bun is good. Peanut butter toast is normal. Kopi is decently strong although not my fav beans beans. Place by the stall is airy. Parking is terrible. Haha.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115003699534688199669/reviews
Cl Ang,5,"Real gem here. There was a queue and it took me a while to order but they are efficient, and patient. The lady fronting and serving is nice too. The quality is really good. I enjoyed the big eggs and toast is just perfect. Coffee also nicely roasted not too overpowering yet strong enough for me. Without bad aftertaste for a traditional coffee. Love it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113021594581484035202/reviews
