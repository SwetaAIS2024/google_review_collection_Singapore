Samantha Yeo,3,"Located ultra close to the MRT, the hostel is great for people on budgets. The inside would need a bit of cleaning up, with the toilet looking dirty (I didn't even dare to step inside) and random stuff like boxes and pillows being packed all around. However, the owner is professional when I check in and out. Prepare some cash to pay a deposit for the key.

Pro:
Location
Cheap

Con:
Needs a bit of clean up
