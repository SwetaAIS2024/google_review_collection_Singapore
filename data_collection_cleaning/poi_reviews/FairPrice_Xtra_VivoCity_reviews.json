There’s your typical snacks, beverages, hygiene products, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish sections and way more smaller or bigger sections. Aisles are very organized, the whole FairPrice is quite clean, quite a few staff all around and very friendly as well. I’ve come here multiple times and always had a good experience.",
