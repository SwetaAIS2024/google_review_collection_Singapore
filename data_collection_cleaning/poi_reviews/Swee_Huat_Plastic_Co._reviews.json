      "text": "Walked in on 2 Jan'24 (1st day of biz in NY). Bought a set of mini mahjong, foldable wooden table and tile rulers. No room for bargain at all but their price is indeed better than online. Quality of tiles is good as usual cos I'm a returning customer who have bought many times from them, including a solid wood foldable table which is now obsolete. Table quality is good.\nStaff not very friendly though but importance is that I get what I what at a reasonable price ◡̈",

I had to take a couple of photos and send my friends in order to come to a conclusion on which set to buy but she kept mumbling stuff like oh you have taken all the photos already, still not buying? The range of mahjong was also not that huge.. But it is still a heritage shop as it had been around for at least 30+ years I think?",
