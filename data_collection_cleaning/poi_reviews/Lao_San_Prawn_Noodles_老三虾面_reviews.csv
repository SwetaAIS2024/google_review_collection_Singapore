Clicktosave,1,"I would like to express my disappointment regarding my recent experience at your establishment.

The male staff who attended to me displayed a poor attitude. I had requested and paid for an additional serving of noodles, but it was not provided. I have attached photos for your reference, one with added noodles and one without. Both look the same right?

Additionally, the soup served was barely one-third full, which was far below expectations.

This experience was truly disappointing, and I urge others not to patronize the store.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102854273672724200011/reviews
Thaddeus Zheng,2,"Just plain noodles and sauce. Probably the component that resembles a prawn mee is the soup.

Small portion, unsatisfying bowl. Lacking of quantity & quality.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114223914636653789152/reviews
XGL Cool,4,"New stall, first time tried.
Soup is very good, flavourful. Can choose types of noodle. Dry version too much sauce in my opinion, but I guess that makes it tasty.

Only complain is prawn is sliced into half, which really affect the ‚Äòbite feel‚Äô; and it doesn‚Äôt make de-shelling any easier.

The pig stomach is tender. Hope to try the intestines next time, if I still have remaining CDC vouchers to use üòâ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103093430885144194855/reviews
Alvin Quah,4,"ËÄÅ‰∏âËôæÈù¢ Lao San Prawn Noodles ÁªôÈù¢Â≠êpork noodles and Hello Fried Chicken caught my eye as I was checking out this coffeeshop at Bukit Batok after my bike inspection.

Decided to go healthy with the prawn noodles in soup üòÑ üòÑ üòÑ. I ordered the prawn noodles without ribs version - thinking of leaving some room for curry puffs.

First impression was great. There were 1 and a half prawns of decent size in the noodles, the fishcake slices looked gourmet and there were also pork lard (shout-out to the fans) and fried onions in the soup.

The soup tastes decently good, it is not as rich as those other branded prawn noodles, which threaten to clog up your arteries or cause a gout flare-up rightaway, and not as thin as your primary school canteen's prawn mee stall.

The fish cake was really good, there is not a tinge of fishiness when I ate it. You can tell they use quality, fresh ingredients.

Pork lard was crispy and prawns were fresh so I managed to peel them off the shells with the chopsticks and my teeth.

As for service, auntie didn't smile and didn't look too friendly, I think need to warn up more üòÇ

Overall it's value for money at $4.90 and offers a great pawn noodles fix if you are nearby.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117766417318468985509/reviews
Eve Liu,1,"The female cashier taking the order is too hostile & has bad manners.  She interrupted me abruptly when I was ordering while she spoke to another, and the details were missed out. She did not hear my order not to have chilli. When I reminded her, she raised her voice and reprimand me for not telling early(which I did).

After all that fuss & embarrassment, I was still given 2 bowls of spicy chilli noodles. The food was wasted as I never take chilli noodles. Paid $15 for 2 bowls. Will you go there??

Don't understand why people are so unhappy earning a living. We treat them with all the respect, but received such idiotic treatment for patronising...

There were many similar complaints before... I guess the company wouldn't care less.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110999678937991494084/reviews
