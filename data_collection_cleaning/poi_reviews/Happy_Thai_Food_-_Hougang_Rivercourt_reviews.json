      "text": "Came here with my family on a lazy Sunday for lunch. Tom Yum Seafood Hotpot smells so good when served (my mum loves Tom Yum Soup), and tasted good too, with a bit of aromatic coconut and lemongrass taste. Ingredients are fresh, especially the prawns and squids. Generous portions of seafood in the Tom Yum Seafood Soup. The seafood sauce goes well with the fresh cockles. For those who love extra servings of sauces, they are available on the self-service section. Kailan with oyster sauce tasted just great. Spoilt with lots of food choices in the menu. Will definitely come again.",

The pig trotter rice was slightly gamey (subjective) while the tom yum and green curry were too diluted for my liking. Will give this a pass the next time I see it on delivery apps.",
