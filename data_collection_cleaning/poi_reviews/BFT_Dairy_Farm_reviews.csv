Max See Yong Jun,5,"Many gyms speak of their community as a factor when selling their experience to you, but none truly delivers on that like BFT Dairy Farm.

If you find yourself struggling to ballot a BTO, don’t be shy to call BFT Dairy Farm your second home as you find yourself turning up daily simply to soak in the endorphins of a good workout with your gym buddies.

If improving your fitness is not your priority then BFT Dairy Farm is not for you, the steady progression of workouts caters to all levels of fitness and allows you to adjust your intensity according to your own starting point.

Love hate relationships with the coaches here are common, chatting like old pals before and after workouts, yet cussing them under your breath during. (but that’s only cos they love us and push us to reach our goals ❤️)

Three things in life are certain; death, taxes and a good workout at BFT Dairy Farm",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110628883519286950955/reviews
