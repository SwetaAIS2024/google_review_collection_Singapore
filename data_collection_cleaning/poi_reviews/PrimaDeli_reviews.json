Made fresh upon order, I tried it with peanut filling for just $2.10â€”a great combination.\n\nHowever, it could be even better if they used crunchy peanut butter for added texture. The current peanut filling was a bit too watery for my liking",

I am talking about their waffle.\n\nIf anyone has a crave for good and tasty waffle, this is the one outlet you can go for.\n\nMy whole family, including my 5 years old son simply loves the plain waffle. As for me, I will always go for the peanut waffle.\n\nDon't be surprised when you happened to place an order, the queue formed earlier will make you wait for at least about 10 to 15 minutes for your order to be ready.",
