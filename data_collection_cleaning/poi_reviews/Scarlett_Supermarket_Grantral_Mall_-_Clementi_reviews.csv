Martin Yeo,5,"A relatively big supermarket packed with mostly Chinese imported goodies, completed with some small cooked food counters. Well stocked and conveniently located next to the Clementi MRT station. The place has one counter manned by a staff and two self checkout out counters, for checking out your purchases.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107217464996017596553/reviews
kang shiqiang,1,"If I could give zero star, I would give zero star.... Absolutely worse customer experience I've had in a while, the shop at the front selling the 生煎包 literally shouted at me for a good minute just because I was no longer buying anything from their store. Such uncouth and gangster actions from the male employee. Will never buy from them again. Absolutely disgusting behavior.

The food from the image comes from the other shop deeper  into Scarlett market. Highly recommend them , friendly service staff, and even provided additional service to ask & pack everything nicely. The food is really good, bigger portion as well and more affordable.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111685677604209954208/reviews
LP Pua,5,"This is one of the larger Scarlett Supermarket branches, and it features a cooked food section. However, the main reason we always visit this branch is because their Cha-Pi drink is the cheapest, at $10 for a carton of 15.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Gator,4,Quite an interesting supermarket that sells lots of items imported from China. This is the Chinese version of Don Don Donki where you literally can find most food items that’s manufactured in China. There was a live station as well selling cooked food like dumplings and Chinese dishes. We bought a number of these to try at home as there was no seatings within.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
웬케빈,5,"Scarlett Supermarket in Grantral Mall offers a pleasant shopping experience with its wide selection of imports, quality snacks, and diverse prepacked grocery items. The store is well-organized and clean, making it easy to find what you need. Staff are generally helpful and courteous, enhancing the overall customer service. Prices are competitive, though some specialty items can be on the higher side. Their cooked meat section is particularly noteworthy for its delicious cuts of meat and cooked vegetables.
