Didnâ€™t expect much, but the waffle was actually really good and the food overall was impressive. Nice bonusâ€”free kids meal on weekdays when you order a main and any drink. Definitely worth a visit!",

The cheese coupled with the tomato sauce made it very mushy after awhile :(\n\nRosti was bland and very oily ðŸ˜© roast chicken was cooked well\n\nAlso the seats gave me abit of rash - I think it hasnâ€™t been cleaned in awhile.\n\nAtmosphere is cozy but would only return for drinks and not the food.",
