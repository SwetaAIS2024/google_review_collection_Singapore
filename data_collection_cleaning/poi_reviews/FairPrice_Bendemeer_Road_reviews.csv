Patricia Yeow,1,"I previously had a disappointing experience with one of the cashiers, a typical auntie. The service was not only rude, but I also overheard her gossiping incessantly with her colleagues, all while pretending to be friendly at the same time. Hypocrite! What a shame to tarnish the reputation of such a well-known brand. Fortunately, she isn't assigned to any of the larger stores in the mall.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105596420947707904040/reviews

Vicq,3,Very small outlet - it is the smallest NTUC FairPrice outlet I have ever been to so obviously does not carry many other groceries and items as most FairPrice outlets but still have the bare basic necessities. The size is approximately three 7-Eleven convenience store. Am quite surprised that FairPrice does not have a bigger outlet here as the Bendemeer estate has a lot of residents.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106473378023729080154/reviews
Cynthia Ng,5,"The manager and the staff are very helpful when my mother carelessly dropped her CDC vouchers in the shop. They are empathetic and the lady Filipino manager handles the verification process professionally to avoid scams. Appreciate the effort.
The shop is small in size compared to most NTUC outlets because it's more of a franchise shop like some NTUC Cheers outlet. However, I have also observed that most of the staffs and manager working there are very patient with elderly at the cashier counters, especially during long queues.
As this is a mature estate with a lot of elderly, their attitude is worth the compliment.
If you have no patience during payment queues, I will advise you to buy at other places.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117927561997094123656/reviews
