      "text": "After careful research online, me and my fiancee decided to select Vineyard as our ROM lunch reception venue. We select the outdoor patio as the ROM ceremony and the indoor air conditioned restaurant for the lunch reception. Have to say the actual event turned out super great. Best choice ever. And the key factor to make this event so successful is our coordinator Mr Aaron Gardner, the senior partnership exec from Vineyard. He is the one that guide us thru from start to end and ensure all the requests (so long is reasonable) being met and able to give tonnes of useful advices based on our condition. So so grateful to have him to be our key planner on our big day!!! Highly recommended to look for Mr Aaron and select Vineyard for any of your important events:)",
