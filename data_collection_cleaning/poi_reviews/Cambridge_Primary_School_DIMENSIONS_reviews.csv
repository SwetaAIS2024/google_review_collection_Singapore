divya kulkarni,5,"Dimensions Primary School BukitTimah-
I can say this is best school academics wise, budget friendly and provides a holistic development of child.
The staff are polite, warm and pretty informative at both the campuses.
Creative learning rather than stressing or by hearting.
Teachers are mostly  Singaporeans , that's the best  thing coz they are so warm, kind, patient  and empathetic towards students.
as part of CCA the child learns Music, drawing, painting, word puzzles , Sudoku etc.
Transportation facility available all around Singapore. the bus captains are friendly.
my child is in P3 here I'm extremely happy about my decision on choosing Dimensions.
i would recommend this school with an immense confidence.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114935455291332861076/reviews
