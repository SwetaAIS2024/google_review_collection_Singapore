      "text": "The food was delicious and service was hospitable. However, the portions were particularly measly. We were told that we could add more noodles to the pho for an extra $1.90, which is such a money-grabber, since a bag of noodles is really not that expensive when you buy them yourself at the market. Moreover, the kampung mama meal was awfully stingy. The lemongrass chicken came with one wing and a footâ€”hardly any meatâ€”and the vegetable serving looked like an afterthought. The soup was also just a clear broth with no substance. They were generous with the rice, but given the tiny side dishes, youâ€™d end up eating plain rice on its own.\n\nFYI, they donâ€™t take credit card. Itâ€™s either cash or payment through an app.",

      "text": "If you're craving authentic Vietnamese cuisine, this restaurant is a must-visit. The pho has a rich, flavorful broth that truly captures the essence of traditional Vietnamese cooking. The spring rolls are a standout, generously filled with large, juicy prawns. Even if youâ€™re not in the mood for Vietnamese fare, the Western dishes here are also impressively well-prepared.\n\nThe serving staff add to the excellent experience with their warm and friendly service. They were welcoming and provided great recommendations that enhanced our meal. The restaurant's inviting atmosphere makes it perfect for family dining. Highly recommended!",
