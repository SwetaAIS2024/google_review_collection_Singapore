V,5,"A hidden gem! This cozy little pizza joint‚Äîrun by a friendly Muslim couple, I believe‚Äîsurprised us in the best way. We visited on a Saturday evening and were initially concerned as we were the only table, but the place quickly filled up after 8PM.

Ordering was smooth and easy through the QR code, and the food was served promptly. The pizza was genuinely one of the best I‚Äôve had, delicious and reasonably priced. Will definitely be back to try more flavours.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113989276641195154173/reviews
aljufrey,5,"Nice cosy little pizza joint! They make great pizzas for those who love the soft thin dough type.. freshly made upon order, you‚Äôll eat them piping hot when served!

We had the Spicy Kambing, Chicken Cilantro and Beef Pepperoni for our daughter, and she also loved it!

Their warning on their pizza box: ‚Äú1 slice may not be enough!‚Äù And boyyyy, I told them even 1 whole pizza wasn‚Äôt enough! We had to order 3 of them hahah.. definitely worth a try!

Oh and Chef Nawi was very friendly and took time to explain to us the pizza making process etc.. keep up the great work and I truly believe they‚Äôll gain much success from here on InsyaAllah ü§≤üèº",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110676694627158948829/reviews
Zac Z,5,"This cozy pizza joint serves freshly baked pizzas with a well-balanced flavor profile. Something different from the common pizza franchise. The taste is not overpowering, striking the perfect harmony between the cheese and sauce. I particularly enjoyed the Margherita pizza, while my kids devoured the chicken mushroom and beef pepperoni varieties. With six slices per pizza, it was just right for our family of four‚Äîand even my picky eaters finished off every bite! Though the drink selection is currently limited, I wish them the best and hope to see their menu expand in the future.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112637368661833061368/reviews
HAFIIZ ZAHIIN,5,Definitely will go again for other menu. Tried beef pepparoni. My daughter cleared it all. Zaatar has a unique taste but we like it. Spicy kambing is just yummeih. Service was great and friendly. Pizza dough was soft even when it was cold from our take away box.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109200449198490862137/reviews
Peng Hui Lim,5,"Good size pizza and my kids love the standard pizza like margherita pizza. I'm not a fan of steak pizza, just my personal preference.   We did take away, Pizza are freshly make to order, so it's great to eat there freshly made.  The seating are a bit limited, but service when ordering are great :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105135522970910242835/reviews
