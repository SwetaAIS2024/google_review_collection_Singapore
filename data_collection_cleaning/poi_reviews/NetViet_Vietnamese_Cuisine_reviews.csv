michelle wong,5,This stall is quiet and unassuming. Ordered the Grilled Chicken dry noodles and it was tasty. The best Vietnamese dry noodle I had! The sauce made it so refreshing for the hot weather. It also come with a spring roll which is nice as well.

Jo elle,5,"My favourite Vietnamese food, highly recommend the Banh Mi and summer roll

So far all the dishes have been a hit, the beef noodles and pork rice are worth a try!

The lady boss is also very friendly and kind, when we ate there she will serve the food to us which is so sweet.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102868240875661939796/reviews

Min HL,5,"Able to pre order via their whatsapp number - 86680344!

Ordered 2 items:
B5 Grilled Pork w vermicelli - grilled pork taste and smell very fragrant. the peanuts & fried onions adds a nice aroma and crunch to the dish

B12 Fresh Summer Rolls - nice! lettuce and cucumber are fresh. the rolls are wrapped in plastic to ensure the rolls do not stick together.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103965869018673563240/reviews
