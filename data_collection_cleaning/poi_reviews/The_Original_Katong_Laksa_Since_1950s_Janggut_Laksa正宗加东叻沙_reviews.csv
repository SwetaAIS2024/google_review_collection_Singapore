tm sii,3,"It's like thick vermicelli in super rich curry broth with coconut milk aroma, unlike the usual Laksa in Malaysia using thin vermicelli. A nice flavour. Otak-otak Is good too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104063137357045257769/reviews
Mr Wang Wang,3,"Visited around 6 PM and ordered two sets of laksaâ€”one with otah and the other with muah chee. The laksa tasted pretty average, nothing particularly special about it. The unique aspect was that they donâ€™t provide chopsticks.

The otah was just your standard fare, while the muah chee was overly sweet with an excessive amount of sugar mixed with the peanut.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100792947771991544056/reviews
M K,5,Best laksa I ever had.  Thick coconut milk gravy and it is gluten free. No wheat flour or soya sauce. Ask for no fishcake (no gluten-free) Contain dried shrimp and fresh prawn and clam,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104322352588427851712/reviews
Koh Thiam Guan,3,"Brought my stainless steel food container to buy 2 portions of laksa. Was told that they will charge $0.50 per portion even we use our own container. Reason is that they will give more gravy. When I tell them I donâ€™t need more gravy, the counter staff said the 50 cents still apply. In the end paid extra $1.00. Those need to ta pau no need to bring own container as they will charge u $0.50 whatever the case. Just left the shop.ðŸ˜ž",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105553990327602411997/reviews
