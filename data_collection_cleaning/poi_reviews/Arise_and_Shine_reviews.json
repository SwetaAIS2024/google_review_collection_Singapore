They don't serve iced drinks during university vacation time.. they said they don't bring in ice during the school breaks.",

The kopi they serve is good.\n\nFor snacks, they have a wide variety. They have the buns (Bo Luo Bao, hot dog bun), sandwiches (egg mayo, ham), waffles, fried items (samosa, banana ball, vadai), cakes (sold by the slice), and many others. The snacks are generally quite good.\n\nThe queue may be quite busy after lunch time and or tea-break time, but the queues are generally moving quickly.",
