Zac Tan,3,"Nice place with good vibes. I personally like the names of the bagel - good puns. The bagels are good but somehow seems normal. There’s nothing special about the bagel and I’m unsure if it’s homemade.

The purple pickled cabbage is really good even though I don’t normally like it. Super refreshing and balances the pulled pork well.

Slightly expensive for the quality, hence the 3 stars.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113474926495303866354/reviews
Jonathan Tan,4,"We got the brekkie and the porky on a Sunday afternoon. We didn’t have to wait very long for our orders and there’s a bit of room for eating in. The flavours were great, the pickled cabbage stole the show for the Porky. The texture of the bagel was soft and not very chewy (unlike the NY style). So overall  great sandwich but not the most ideal if you’re looking for something chewy with a crisp exterior.

I would recommend eating the bagels quickly if you’re getting takeaway as the more savoury/saucy options may get soggy quite quickly.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111600357886320328567/reviews
Joyce Koh,5,"we enjoyed the food here very much! ordered the porky fiesta and can trust chic bagels and they were both very good! the truffle flavour blended really well with the gooey cheese, the portion of chicken was generous too. the pork was tender and the slaw cut through all of the heavyness making for a well-balanced dish! the iced lemon tea was also really good and refreshing~ the cafe was very vibey with good music and a cozy interior, staff were very warm and friendly too! would def come back again ☺️",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104258259445156119444/reviews
randall,4,Pretty surprised how nice and tasty the bagels were. The creamy wet eggs really do help the whole dish along. Got the Luncheon and breakie. Kinda prefer the breakie as eggs and bacon combo is good. The Luncheon had super thick cuts of luncheonmeat but it was too thick for our liking.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109975281303071622618/reviews
Elaine,5,"delicious bagels!! we got the “can trust chic” bagel comprising of grilled teriyaki chicken with mushrooms (tastes like a mushroom swiss burger but bagel version), and the “porky fiesta”, which has pork, bacon and cabbage. both were very enjoyable and serving size was huge :)",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104919347946879574362/reviews
