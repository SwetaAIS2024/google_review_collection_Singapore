Cathy Wu,5,"It’s a wonderful LOB diving trip with GS-Diving.

On May 2019, we used our long weekend and join leisure dive with GS-Diving. The instructors and dive masters are professional, we’ve explored many place include wreck and seen many marine life.

The boat- Seaborne, with some age but maintain quite well, with 2 bathrooms and 5 bedrooms, each bedroom with double-deck bed. The room is not big but nice and comfortable. As a diver I am very happy to spent my nights on Seaborne. Again, this is not luxury boat but it’s definitely quite good for LOB.

The staffs and captain are friendly and nice, we even had BBQ for dinner. It’s definitely unforgettable trip with GS-Diving.

Sorry I didn’t realized I had recommended at many places such as FB but not Google. I will definitely join again once we can travel.

If you had no experience on LOB but consider where to start diving and where to learn, I will definitely recommend to start from here. I did not start my diving here and I met many instructors before during diving trip, therefore I highly recommend to join GS-Diving because the instructor, Gary Lim is reliable and professional.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111732712736124528238/reviews
Ronald Chan,5,"Professional live on board diving operator under new management Gary and his experienced team of divers. Our dive master Bert has 350 logged dives and unearths all sea treasures! Amazing! The friendly crew was on the ball, equipment well maintained and in mint condition, organization of the dive trip solid bom pee pee. The food was fit for kings. 10/10 would dive with GS again.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109298398031027771945/reviews
Damien Storer,5,"Just returned from my first ever diving experience with gs-diving and completing my Open Water certificate. Great fun and truly memorable. Professional team, well organised and made me feel welcome from the start. There's no egos or bragging here, just staff keen to share their passion with others. I can't speak highly enough of Julian my dive instructor. He made learning a fun, safe and exciting experience. Salut!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118244136858654723114/reviews
Diana Lisova,5,"Great diving weekend getaway from Singapore. I joined the liveaboard trip on MV Seaborne around Bintan last weekend. Everything was organized very well: no delays, changes of plans or whatsoever, which I experienced with other Singaporean dive operators. All equipment is well maintained, the instructors and dive masters are very friendly, professional and ensure high standards of safety. Throughout the trip you do not need to worry about anything, just put on the gear and dive! Food was great, served 4x times a day. Pricing is very reasonable, considering everything. I am very surprised to see negative reviews about the organization and the boat. The boat is equipped with pretty much anything you need for comfort: hot showers, a fridge, a cooler with fresh water. If you are expecting a 5-star all-inclusive cruise with Michelin star chefs, you should go on a cruise ship. This is a diving trip on a diving boat after all. It’s all about diving and having a great time with like-minded people!",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114844631411848064575/reviews
Kenneth Low,5,"We found GS Diving for our year end family activity. THe wife and I were already certified for basic open water (but had not dived for way too long), and our 3 kids were fresh to the diving scene. We met up with Gary, and he was patient in explaining the steps for PADI certification (which had changed since when we took ours).

For the pool and open water dives, Felix was our Dive Instructor and he was easy going (while being safe) and did not pressure us at all to complete our pool check out. More importantly, he was able to quickly bond with our teenage kids.

We did the open water at Lazarus, where the currents were not too strong (one of our concerns for the kids and us as we're essentially touching the water again).  Visibility was not the best, but we make do with what we have. While the kids went for the check out dives with Felix, we were partnered with Yann as our Dive Master/underwater tour guide. Yann was also a great help as both the missus and I were struggling a bit controlling our buoyancy and  he was able to keep us together. Amazingly, he was able to pick up sea life in that low vis environment. It was not the best, and one had to really get up close and personal to see the corals and fishes and all the other sea life at Lazarus.

All in all, it was a great experience. The kids enjoyed it thoroughly as did we, and now, we're all certified to get back into the water and prepare for new explorations when the borders reopen.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111940595459476074236/reviews
