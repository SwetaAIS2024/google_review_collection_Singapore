Mui Cher Ng,5,"I have many spider veins and some varicose veins
developed over the years.  Dr Chen diagnosed my condition and explained to me in details and the recommended procedure. He is a very patient and reassuring doctor. He performed a sclerotherapy and the procedure went smoothly. I had no pain or discomfort after the procedure which surprised me. I appreciate Dr Chen checking on me twice even after the procedure had completed which is usually rare for a specialist.
The staff are also very caring and efficient. The clinic is well run. I recommend Dr Chen and this clinic for those who wish to seek treatment on this issue,",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116339835302835987915/reviews
Katja Schlamp,5,"My husband got a vein procedure here. From start to finish everything was great. It was a long hassle with the insurance, but the staff did everything they could to set everything up. On the day of the procedure it was a very warm welcome, everything was well explained, my husband felt really well taken care of. The procedure went perfectly fine and the aftercare was excellent. We can absolutely recommend. We felt super happy that we chose this doctor and his wonderful staff.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117631749477186100893/reviews
lee jessica,5,"The doctors and the nurses were nice and kind and the procedure went well as well. The day surgery didn‚Äôt take that long and I was under anaesthesia. In a blink of an eye, I woke up lying on the bed in the recovery room. The porridge they provided after my surgery was really delicious as well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107262488477715831239/reviews

Pinky Doros,5,"I had my UFE under Dr. Chen Min Qu and his team.
I‚Äôve been suffering from Uterine Fibroids for many years and it‚Äôs only now that I can do this procedure due to my age. Dr. Chen is such a kind doctor and patient to explain the case and procedure. His team of nurses/admin assistants are all friendly too. I am recommending them for those who also suffering from fibroids and looking for non-invasive procedure. Thanks Sujatha for your care!
Thanks again VIC teamüôè It was a great experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104646546908205052226/reviews
