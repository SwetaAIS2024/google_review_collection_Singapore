      "text": "Ordered the floss toast set for $6.60. Coffee nice and strong. Eggs came whole and you have to crack them open yourselves. They are the usual Singaporean very soft runny kind, so watch out when cracking them open. Do it over the bowls provided! Toast a bit dry, pork floss ok - think it‚Äôs sprinkled with a squeeze of honey? Would have preferred it not cut into 9 small squares, but rather let me do the cutting - may have not dried out as much. Filling if not particularly nutritious breakfast!",

It's has nice aroma and nice to drink.\n\nThere is high table and those normal seats at Novena Square outlet. Environment is bright and clean.\n\nTheir curry chicken noodles and mee rebus is nice.\n\n#ILoveToastBox",
