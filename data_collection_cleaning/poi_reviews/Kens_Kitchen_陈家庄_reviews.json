Really love the taste of every single dish we had ordered so far!\nFor our first try, we had Hong Kong noodles, Sambal Potato Leaves & Coffee Pork Rib. We love the taste of sambal! You could taste the dried shrimp in it! The coffee pork rib was a üëçüèªüëçüèª!\nToday we tried the Mongolian Chicken which was a rock üåü too! Sambal kangkung will never disappoint us and the moonlight kway teow was pretty decent too! Oh! Serving for each dish was of the right size too!\nHope to dine in some day! üòä",
