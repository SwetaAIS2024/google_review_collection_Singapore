oscar w,3,"easy ordering and payment system, just scan QR to order. the menu is clear and pages load very quickly. after placing order, drinks came pretty fast. the prawn noodle soup is very thick and flavourful. Assam laksa was rather disappointing, soup is neither spicy nor sourish enough. no other ingredients except a piece of sardine which is still cold inside.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111622338660084561466/reviews
