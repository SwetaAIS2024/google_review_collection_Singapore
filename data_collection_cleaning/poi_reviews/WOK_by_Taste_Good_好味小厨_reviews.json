Ended up I need to add in chilli sauce to boost up the taste. Total cost is $16.50 for 2 plates of rice.\nAtmosphere is good as they have plenty of seats available during dinner time too.\nThis is location at level 1.",

All were scrumptious and flavourful.\n\nHowever do come earlier (preferably) before 7.30pm), if you prefer soupy dishes as they are sold out pretty fast",
