      "text": "Ordered the tonkotsu ramen, but it tasted quite different from typical tonkotsu – more like a light shio broth, but still not quite that either. My Japanese girlfriend called it “original Singapore ramen,” which might be the best way to describe it. The taste is still pretty good, and at $8 it’s solid value – comes with all the essentials like meat, egg, seaweed, and noodles. Don’t expect Hakata-style richness, but if you frame it as SG hawker-style ramen, it hits the spot.",

The white base is equally good!!!  The portion is good,  more than enough! The pork slices are just too good! The onsen eggs are so good. Had items 12 and 17. Going to try others next time.\n\nDefinitely a must try if you are at this place.\n\nThere's free noodles upsize. There's also more affordable lunch sets.  So check out the menu.\n\nOwner is patient and quick.\n\nStall is right at a corner,  be warn that weekend can be busy. There's a nice space right in front of stall.",
