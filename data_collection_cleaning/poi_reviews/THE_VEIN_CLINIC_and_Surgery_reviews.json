      "text": "I went to Dr. Tan because I was experiencing symptoms related to my varicose veins, including pain in my feet and legs. My feet would swell significantly in the heat and even with minimal physical activity. Additionally, they would swell and cause discomfort.\n\nWhen I visited Dr. Tan, he was extremely professional and took a lot of time to thoroughly analyze my case. He conducted all the necessary tests, including Doppler ultrasounds and other diagnostics, to ensure an accurate diagnosis. He then recommended a treatment plan.\n\nThroughout the entire process, he was always attentive to my concerns. He treated me with great respect and patience, making me feel very comfortable in his clinic.\n\nThe results have been outstanding—my legs and feet are no longer swollen, and the discomfort has disappeared. He even treated an area affected by varicose veins that no doctor in Spain was willing to address, yet he took care of it, and the outcome could not have been better.\n\nFor these reasons, I highly recommend Dr. Tan and his team of Nurses and receptionists. Not only does he listen attentively, but he is also kind, explains everything thoroughly with great patience, and always maintains a positive attitude. If you have vein-related issues or varicose veins, go to Dr. Tan—you will be in the best hands in Singapore",

Dr. Tan has always been thorough and explained everything to us in a way that we could understand. He always patiently listen to our concerns. The nurses at the clinic always very efficient and helpful, respond to emails and chats in a very timely manner. We feel very well taken care of. I would highly recommend The Vein Clinic.",

Essential information was explained during the consultation, hence my condition was assessed as mild case, no underlying serious issue. Oral medication would be sufficient.\nDr John is a good listener; candid doctor :)",
