Salim Finance,1,"If you’re reading this, don’t bother coming. A (small) size bowl of herbal jelly that costs $9. Seems like the owner gradually increased to a point where price and portion does not match anymore. Revaluate your portions if you wish to increase price. $9 is utterly overpriced.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108079087497999095411/reviews
Alps,5,"Stepped into a place filled with fond memories, where you can enjoy herbal Gui Ling Gao jelly and herbal tea. This special jelly is made from a blend of different herbs and is known for its ability to remove toxins from the body and reduce heatiness. People, especially the elderly who are familiar with this brand, love its benefits for the body.

You can choose between a small portion of herbal jelly for $9 or a larger portion for $12. The place is kept very clean, and there are seats inside the shop where you can rest and enjoy your treat. Right now, they have a promotion going on: if you buy a prepaid credit of $100, you'll get an extra $20 value to use at this shop or any of its branches in Singapore.

The staffs are friendly and honest. I left my earbuds in the shop and was still able to retrieve it when I returned a few hours later. The only suggestion is that they should also include the shop contact number on their website.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103635543546981451993/reviews
