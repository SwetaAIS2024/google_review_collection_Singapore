They weren't all medium rare (maybe 3/4s were medium and the rest medium rare), but they still tasted nice and weren't too tough.\n\nService from the staff was great as they were polite and enthusiastic.\n\nIf I could make a suggestion to improve: perhaps the steak orders can be served in batches instead of all at once (since I'm ordering around 10 steaks in one order).",

I noticed most customers are regulars, and I think we will become one of them too. Service was great, respectful and not overly talkative - just wanna serve a meal well I suppose!",

As we used the 1 for 1 entertainer app for this meal, we both decided to keep quiet. How to reverse the done-ness? We are reasonable customers but we won't order the steak if we return.  The 3-star is awarded to the truffle fries.",
