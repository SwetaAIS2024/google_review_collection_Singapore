SeanN WJ,5,"Recently got to know that the stall was taken over by a young couple. Tried their signature chicken chop + an add on wing and it is awesome and taste exactly the same as the previous owner, seems like they have taken over the recipe. Unlike many other western food stall, their signature chicken chop taste tender and juicy. Well marinated and cooked!

Aside from the main dish, the coleslaw and fried bun side dish taste extremely good as well.

Price: Acceptable
Waiting Time: Acceptable
Service: Very friendly

I highly recommend this stall. Definitely one of my top choice for western food.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117974195755499423782/reviews

weeleong yap,5,"Still the best value for money western food not just in Jurong but also Singapore!
Price is reasonable,  and the portion is good!
The level of crispiness of the fries and the chicken wings... always very consistently good!
Go-to order for me are always chicken chop, pork chop, or chicken wings. ....not forgetting the hotdog!
And oh ya how can i forget the ðŸŒ¶ chilli! Somehow the chilli is nostalgically and magically good for me..
