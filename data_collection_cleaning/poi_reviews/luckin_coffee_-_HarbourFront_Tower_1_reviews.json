Quite a distance from the subway station or the malls. The rewards? Half the average price of typical chains. Faster process time as it's not that popular compared to it's other branches.",

My two attempts at checking in with her were met by a stony stare and absolute silence. She really didnt respond! Unbelievable. The drink is average but i do appreciate the 60% voucher and fast production time of the drink. So still give 4 stars!",
