TNJ Housing Solutions Pte Ltd,5,"Super nice nasi Lemak, seriously better than famous ones. Very fragrant rice and crispy well marinated fried chicken wing or drumstick. The sambal chilli is also the thumbs up. Must try!

Teh peng is also nicely done or rather they make nice drinks like ice holick, ice milo too. Not too sweet, not too bland.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103779904320049277745/reviews

Azroy Miller,2,"I recently discovered that the ""Mee Bagus"" coffee shop, despite being listed as open until 10:30 PM on Google, actually closes its doors around 8:00+PM. It's unclear whether this is an official early closure or if the staff simply choose to wrap up operations ahead of schedule. Hopefully, the shop will consider extending its hours to accommodate local residents who would love to enjoy their delicious ""Mee Bagus"" later in the evening.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104230302308049416912/reviews
