      "text": "This is my go-to Ban Mian place around the area. It is simple, and it is cheap. I usually have the Mee Hoon kueh ($3.30) and sometimes the deep fried dumplings which is not too oily as they drain the oil well. They are 10 for $5. Nice broth for the soup and a good al dente bite for the kueh. They usually open till late. Maybe about 9+ to 10pm. 4 stars because not enough veg usually but I am sure you can always ask for more. The dumplings are a good mix of pork, chives and grated carrots.",
