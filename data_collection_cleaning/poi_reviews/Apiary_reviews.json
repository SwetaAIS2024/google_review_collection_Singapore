      "text": "This was my first time at Apiary, I got the passion fruit sorbet (top) and cookies & cream (bottom), the flavours were nice. The passion fruit was more bitter - cookies & cream was sweet and less mild in flavour compared to passion fruit.\n\nThey have upstairs seating with AC.\nThe seating area has 2 incense diffusers which will irritants those that have skin issues or are allergic to fragrances - the cleaning spray they use is VERY strong so I recommend sitting outside near the door.\n\nThe staff were very friendly.\n\nOverall, I recommend this place for ice cream l.",

Waffles is one of the must order item in the menu for the crispy and light texture. We ordered the \"nian gao\" glutinous rice in the center for chewy texture.",

I would've wanted to order more and take some pints home if I liked the other ones. I didn't want to buy something I've never tasted.\n\nGot a 2 scoop. Looks soft when they scoop but it is harder when you eat it.\n\nApiary - you can taste the cocoa nibs. The honey mixed well together.\n\nLychee yuzu sorbet - refreshing and taste what you think. I'd recommend on a hot day.\n\nThe flavors were delicious! If I'm in the area again, I'll come back!\n\nSeating - there's some upstairs and downstairs!",

      "text": "Apiary is a boutique ice cream caf√© tucked away in the heart of Chinatown, known for its artisanal, small-batch ice creams made with quality ingredients and inventive flavours. The interior design emphasizes natural light and clean lines, creating a serene environment that invites patrons to relax and savour their treats.\n\nI had the Baileys & Brownie ‚Äî a rich, indulgent flavour that blends Baileys Irish Cream with chunky brownie bits. It‚Äôs a unique and well-balanced combination that stands out without being overly sweet. Despite it being a weekday afternoon, the caf√© was well-patronized, a testament to its popularity. A definite 5 out of 5 ‚Äî creative flavours, great execution, and a calm, inviting space worth seeking out.",
