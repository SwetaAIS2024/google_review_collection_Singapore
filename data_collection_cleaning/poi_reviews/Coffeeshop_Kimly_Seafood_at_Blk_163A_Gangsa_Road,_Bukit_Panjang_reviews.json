However, I was not sure why the outside of the bun looked so oily. Were they trying to fry it but ran out of time?\n\nStill a great plate of fish and chips for the price though. Might come back for another.",

They make sure food cook out are frangance. Amaze bean sprout cook with salted fish, vegetable cook with dried shrimp.\n\nUnlike social enterpriae rice garden, food taste cannot make it. Use cheap quality rice.",

I had my doubts on whether the food was really being charged by the weight or that a tare was made to ensure that the weight measured excludes the weight of the bowl. The weighing balance was also always being kept in the shop which shows a lack of transparency. When I took the same items but in lesser quantity, the price stayed the same. Will NOT be patronizing this unethical shop again, highly recommend considering having Mala at the shopping malls nearby instead which might cost even lesser and at a better environment.",
