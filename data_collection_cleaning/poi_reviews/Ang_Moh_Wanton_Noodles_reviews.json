      "text": "Wallet-friendly wonton noodles along Joo Chiat road when compared to the other eateries.\n\nNoodles are springy and neutral in taste for the sauce to give the flavour. Nothing to shout about the char siew and wantons (normal/fried).\n\nHowever, do note that the red chilli packs a punch and definitely not suitable for your average ang-mo!\n\nI ordered the smallest $5.00 portion and a plate of $2.50 fried wontons.",

Can tell that the wanton was precooked and left there before itâ€™s reheated to be served.\n\nVeggies were also pre cooked and over cooked before serving.\n\nCharSiew was also dry and tough. The noodles were decently cooked but nothing spectacular about it. Not sure what the hype of this place is about too.",

It tasted similar to what I had at the Tembeling area (Fei Fei wanton mee). Even the chilli and the soup was similar in taste too! But nonetheless the food was good. We also ordered their carrot cake, chicken cutlet noodles. All very good. Will want to come back again after that if I am around the area.\nAtmosphere was pretty great just that their fan was quite strong. Else the noodles will have been piping hot. But I like their food most importantly!",
