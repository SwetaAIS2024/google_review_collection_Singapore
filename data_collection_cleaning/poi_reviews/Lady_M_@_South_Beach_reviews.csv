Taz Tatt,2,"Mixed Feelings at Lady M @ South Beach, Singapore

I was really excited to find out that Singapore has Lady M, and I made my way to the South Beach branch with high hopes. However, I felt a bit disappointed the moment I walked in. The shop didn‚Äôt have a visible cake display ‚Äî instead, you order by looking at photos in the menu. The atmosphere was rather quiet and a little lifeless, lacking the cozy, vibrant vibe I usually associate with cake caf√©s.

There were only a few customers, and we ended up eating quietly at our table, which didn‚Äôt feel relaxing at all. The seating area wasn‚Äôt particularly clean either; there were visible stains on the chairs, which was surprising for a place like Lady M.

That said, the cakes were still the highlight. While they didn‚Äôt feel as fresh as I had hoped, I‚Äôve always loved Lady M‚Äôs creations. The Rose Mille Cr√™pes ‚Äî handmade cr√™pes layered with rose-flavored pastry cream and topped with delicate rose jelly ‚Äî was soft, fragrant, and absolutely delicious. The Pistachio Mille Cr√™pes was a bit too creamy for my personal taste, but still well made.

For drinks, I had the Green Pomegranate and Lady M Iced Caf√©, which were refreshing ‚Äî especially in Singapore‚Äôs heat.

All in all, I was glad to enjoy my favorite cakes again, but I do hope this branch improves the overall experience to better reflect the elegance and quality that Lady M is known",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106252418632801929289/reviews
GG K,2,"Crepe cakes are sadly not as good as I remembered them to be many years ago. The service at this outlet is also lacking, the counter staff just stared at us and went to the kitchen after we entered. We then had to seat ourselves down and went to the counter to call for her attention before ordering. The matcha crepe cake now no longer has that strong matcha fragrance that once impressed me, which left us feeling rather disappointed.

Ambience was terrible, the speakers here were spoilt, and were simply butchering the songs. To the management here: please fix your choppy speakers, the noise is unbearable.

Overall, this experience at Lady M has been such a letdown. I'll definitely not be returning.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113182488876013163119/reviews
Darren,4,"Used to love their Mille crepes, and while tastewise it is still pretty good (Green Tea pictured), the price is getting ridiculous...$14.99 for a slice of cake is enormously pricey. Perhaps for a date or special occasion, as the shop's ambience and surroundings are quite aesthetic.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews
Michele C,5,"Got (the world‚Äôs best) Mille Cr√™pes? üç∞
Had the Sake version & it‚Äôs always a moment to soak in each time I visit‚Ä¶consistently amazing no matter which outlet in the world. This one takes the cake for being in such a beautiful location & setting that‚Äôs truly apt for the Lady ‚ô•Ô∏è",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116865273965869189790/reviews
khanh linh,5,"Minimalist design, comfy and quiet place. Great service and the cakes as nice as usual. The new Rose is a recommendation, the fragrance rose taste is refreshing, just a bit sweet for my frd. If u like strong tea, the tea here not for u. They‚Äôre light but tasty. The Happy tea comes w berry taste. Garden of Eden come w fruity taste.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106052650711284514899/reviews
