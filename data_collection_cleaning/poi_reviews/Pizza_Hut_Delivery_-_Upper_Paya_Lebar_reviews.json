Found some hard plastic within the pizza itself. What if my kid was the one eating the pizza and swallowed it? Very dangerous. I expected better quality and standard from an established restaurant. Disappointing.",

Good price and it was still hot and yummy.\n\nTook about 15 minutes to get the order ready. There is one seat inside for two pax.\n\nPreferably order through the app prior for take-away. Mostly about 15-20 minutes to get the order ready to collect.\n\nFew delivery platform drivers collecting their order here.",
