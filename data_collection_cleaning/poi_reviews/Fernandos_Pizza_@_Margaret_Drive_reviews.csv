GG K,5,"Food was great and prices are relatively reasonable.

We got the lunch sets with the Carnivore and Truffle Mushroom flavours. Each came with a soup of the day, which seemed to be tomato soup for us. The medium pizza was really big, and the chef was super generous with the toppings! Well worth the price paid, I must say. The taste was also on point, the pork sausage was really delicious on the carnivore, and the amalgamation of it together with the pepperoni and ham was pure bliss. As for the truffle pizza, the truffle flavour was very pronounced, much better than the average ones. The texture of the base was great, it leans towards a denser and chewier kind of dough, not as airy and light as some other places. However the flavour of the base wasn't that impressive as it didn't really have that fermented taste, but it was still good enough!

Pricing for the lunch set is extremely reasonable at $20 nett (no additional service charge/GST), given the huge portion and high quality. The restaurant wasn't too busy during lunch hours on a weekday, so the environment is nice for chilling. Overall, I'll definitely be back again if I'm craving a good pizza!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113182488876013163119/reviews
z y,5,"Easily one of the better pizza place.
We ordered their Fernando’s special pizza and cheesy meatballs.

The pizza was perfectly crafted, every single ingredient served a purpose. The mash of ingredients was incredibly harmonious along with their crisp and light pizza dough. My only qualm is the olives could be halved in the dish as it can be quite overwhelming.

The meatballs were generously submerged in their tomato sauce. Their tomato base tasted so homely. It was the perfect amount of tartness mixed with the savoury and fresh tomato taste.

Do give their homemade ice tea a chance. Incredibly unique and nice. Definitely the perfect beverage to have with your pizza.

Highly recommend people to give it a try especially if you’re in the area.

Oh, and the manager is very hospitable and friendly :)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111055360606253705951/reviews
CHARM CHARM,5,"We came here just to eat pizza. The owner is so kind and the pizza is so delicious!!! It was the best meal during my trip to Singapore. Especially the hot honey sauce was really delicious, so it was the best trip :-)",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116803221907531914943/reviews
Cait,5,"Wow this meal made us so happy. We ordered the couple combo with half and half Tagliata Di Manzo and Fernando Special, meatballs in tomato sauce, and added on an order of burrata. Food was really good and the ingredients were fresh. Portions are generous too. What makes it even better is we can pay by CDC voucher (you have to ask the staff for assistance at the counter), but even without the vouchers it’s worth every cent. Will be back someday!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107742885395938380986/reviews
Peter Chong,5,"Pizza was amazing. The dough alone was good enough to be a meal. The toppings however weren't to be outshone by the amazing crust. The quality of each of the ingredients was great and the pairing was just perfect too.

Would definitely be back!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115086655103873779488/reviews
