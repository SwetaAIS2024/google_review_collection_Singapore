CH Pow,4,"Very nice tasty soup. Not the overly msg-like soup tat makes one thirsty. I ordered the small soup and the meat portion is generous, lamb rib meat is tender and juicy, certainly not the over boiled fibre kind tat has been cooked too long in the soup. Will definitely be going back for more.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105439485383217004780/reviews
Eskay Seah,5,"Been eating here for a year now. Uncle can be a little grumpy but that‚Äôs how you know the food is hella good. The auntie who works there is really friendly though!

Their mutton soup always hits the spot for me, and I always leave nothing but the bones.

They‚Äôre closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. So just take note!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115216577927077188920/reviews
Vivian Cheong,5,Warm comforting bowl of herbal mutton soup with a good amount of tender mutton and a mixture of other parts. Many bought large at $10 while I bought an $8 medium to try. Will definitely have it again and again. Recommended üëç,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111218219205301874917/reviews
Hoong Wai Wong,5,"Soup is flavourful in a herbal way,
Quite generous with the amount of meat too.

Looks like it's similar standard and quality to the other branches, can eat!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106237336061537561898/reviews
