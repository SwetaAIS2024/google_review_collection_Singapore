      "text": "Teban Neighbourhood Park provides relaxing, exercises, with children and elderly corners for them. The running track has a measuring mile stone marker for the runners. This Park comes with a basketball court and Street Soccer for the youth. The Park also provided barbecuing facilities and sherter for the users. A park full of energy in the early morning as arocbic is a regular event for 7 day in the week. You're most comfortable with the benches provided for enjoying the environment or just watching the birds flying around. The trees provided good shade even in the hot afternoon. And you can view the sunset at the island near the basketball court. With the view onto the Pandan Reservoir. It's good for yourself to be in the Park.",

Well used too by resident of all ages.\n\nThe welcomed sight of residents doing morning dancerobic is a testimony to the park's success. An oasis at the fringe of industrial Jurong and a stone's throw away from the beautiful Pandan Reservoir  - a fact that few property agents actively promotes.\n\nFor us, the lucky ones calling Teban Gardens home - cheers!",
