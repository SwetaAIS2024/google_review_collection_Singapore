What I want to feedback is that I am a Baimei member. I took a photo of the membership card. The membership card is also mine, but I didn’t bring the card with me. My points, the first time I called Baimei Company to give feedback, but still nothing There has been an improvement. This is the second time. I thought the company would explain it to me. However, there has been an improvement. As long as the card is confirmed to belong to that guest, points can be given to the guest. The waiter insisted not to let me get points. It really made me I am very disappointed, I don’t want to give my heart to you, and I hope to get an explanation from your company.",
