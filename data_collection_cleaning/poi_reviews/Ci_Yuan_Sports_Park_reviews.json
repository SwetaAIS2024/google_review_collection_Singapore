There’s children playground, street soccer cage, jogging/running track, fitness bars, picnic and seatings around. It’s also walking distance to Ci Yuan community centre/hawker centre.",

There's a huge pavilion in the middle for gathering and not sure what purpose. Events maybe?\nStill, I wouldn't call this a park given the size. But with what's around the area (nothing much to be honest), a great place for exercise!",

What I don't like is many people walk their dogs and some don't pick up the poop of their pets. And a group of ah peks walk here often but talk & block the damn path  so often. Other than that it's a nice park for a walk.",
