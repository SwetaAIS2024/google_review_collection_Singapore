Cho lin xiang,1,"Don't bother to purchase from here, complete waste of time. Not efficient, no customer service, reply 1-2 days later, sarcastic remarks, rude, pretend that they're robotic with replies much later, delay in issuing invoice and delivery, etc.

After seeing so many bad remarks here, they don't bother too!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118193595841559149227/reviews

Jena Lim,1,"I had ordered hampers from this company this year and realised a lot of wood dust dropped from the base of the hamper. The wood base is broken and has a lot of mouldy spots. I email and left message to them to request for a refund or exchange but never reply.This is unacceptable and it is impossible to for me to give this hamper away to my friend as a CNY gift.

Saw a lot of people comment and complain on their official FB fan page these few days, either hamper damage or never receive the hamper after made order. Also they are facing the same issues, not able to reach the seller via email, whatsapp and call at all.

Bad service and irresponsible seller! Never order hamper or any products from them anymore!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115612306619682859878/reviews
