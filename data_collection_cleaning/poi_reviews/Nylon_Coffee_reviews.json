However, the shop is quite small and often extremely crowded, which makes it hard to relax and fully enjoy the experience.",

You have to walk through a narrow path, and then a small, open green garden comes into sight, with the café on the left.\n\nThough ，the café is small,  the outdoor area is decorated with lots of plants, so you can sit at the outside area to enjoy the 'green' decor.\n\nWe ordered 2 Iced Long Black , and it's the best Long Black I've had in the past five years. It has a bright , clear fruity taste with just a hint of bitterness— very refreshing drink after walking under the sun.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and make you feel welcome!\n\n------------------------------------------\nValue for Money:3/5",

Very crowded cafe and always long Q , location not so easy to find under a local flat Apartment . Multi storey Public car park  available. Price is value for money.",

It’s light, crisp, and incredibly refreshing, best enjoyed on the spot. The staff know their craft, and the quality is consistently top-notch. If you’re a coffee lover, this place is a gem.",

Not a place to work but to enjoy coffee and chat with your friends as there isn't much seating.\n\nGreat coffee and friendly staff that helped with recommendation for filter coffee as well!",
