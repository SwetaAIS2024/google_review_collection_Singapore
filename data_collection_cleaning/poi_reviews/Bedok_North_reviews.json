      "text": "Bedok North MRT station. Horrible experience. Accidentally left my phone and wallet with my friend and she tapped out first. Could not call out to her as she walked off and hence, could not get out as I couldnâ€™t tap out and my form of communication was also not with me. Staff had the audacity to comment a very rude and disrespectful remark. This happened on the 26th of March 2025 around 12AM. If as a service worker you have no compassion for your people, why even serve? It was an accident. Not on purpose. Nobody is out to make your life harder for you, please check yourself first before making any sort of comments. Disgusting behaviour from SBS staff. Would give 0 stars if I could.",

      "text": "Very nice material design style, simple floor plan. One thing I appreciate is how simple the station floor plan and design is - the three exits have large and clear signs labelling them, the toilets are easily found and the four card top-up machines ensure there will not be any annoying waits during peak hours. The beauty in simplicity concept carries forward to the exits as well, which are all beautifully designed, have lifts, and look nice when viewed from a nearby HDB flat",
