Julian W.,5,"One of the oldest Theravada Buddhist temples in Singapore.

Daily puja in English. Also free classes on dharma and abhidharma on Sunday mornings from 10am to 11am. One hour per subject. Conducted in English and lesson materials (including high quality textbooks) are provided for free.  Teachers are volunteers. There are exams every year and it takes five years, I believe, to complete the course. There is also a diploma program.

Also, there are Buddhist chanting classes conducted every week.

In addition, there are free meditation classes (mindfulness - non religious) that are open to the public. And other classes such as yoga. Depending on the available of volunteers to lead the class. Most, if not all, of these classes are conducted in English.

Highly recommended.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108980951554403203384/reviews
