      "text": "NomStopX at SIT Campus Foodgle Hub offers affordable and delicious American-style comfort food, with hearty options like Nashville chicken, spicy chicken sandwiches, mac n cheese, and BBQ ribs. The food is satisfying and perfect for a quick, filling meal. However, itâ€™s worth noting that several popular items, such as dirty rice and BBQ ribs, were out of stock before 1pm during my visit. Additionally, the bread used for some sandwiches could be of better quality. Overall, itâ€™s a great spot for tasty, budget-friendly meals, but I hope theyâ€™ll keep their stock up and improve the bread in the future.",

      "text": "Happy to support this stall!\n\nI enjoyed the jerk chicken with dirty rice on my first visit. Today I decided to have blackened fish with a side of charred broccoli. They were out of dirty rice.\n\nThe fish was well done with a buttery sauce which I enjoyed very much. It went well with the plain rice. Would have probable been a bit too much with the dirty rice.\n\nThe broccoli had a good char and smokiness to it, though a tad heavy handed on the salt. But overall I still enjoyed it and would order it again.\n\nWill come back to try their other dishes.",

The dog was alright being a chicken frank I assumed. Nothing special with the usual sauce and relish and bun. I guess it's a decent try for American carribean food at a very affordable price.",

Owners are friendly, passionate in what they do and have great knowledge about the food they whip up. Food was served quick and piping hot. I was eating nomstop for sure... Travelled 1.5 hours from the West and have no regrets. Northeasties especially SIT students you're in for a treat!!!\n\nMust orders are their Nashville fried chicken, lobster sandwich and jerk leg chicken rice ðŸ¤¤ðŸ˜‹",
