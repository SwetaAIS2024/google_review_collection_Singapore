      "text": "One of the best Thai food place I've been to in sg so far. The food was good ! especially the fish, I usually don‚Äôt really like fish but this is really fresh and crispy the sauce was very good too. The green curry was very fragrant and the beef was tender, very flavourful and creamy for the curry. Their clear tom yam has so many ingredient in it and the flavour was fantastic enough spicy and enough sourness too. Even the stuff chicken wing was very good. The desserts are good , not too sweet and very good especially the taco, mango sticky rice, Tapioca and the tang yuan. Totally worth coming!",

See the photo; the couple purchased two coconuts from Fairprice and orange juice from iJooz. I was curious, so I approached the staff; they were aware but not opposed to it. I suppose I can bring my own food and eat here next time, as there is a free seat and table! üëç",

But for the price, I was expecting a bit more.\n\nMaybe we were just extra hungry, but the portions seemed a tad on the small side compared to what we were expecting. Still tasty though! Just gotta factor that in next time we decide on Thai for lunch.\n\nNote: My photos are zoomed in.\n\nTips below üëá\n\nPortion Patrol: I might have to do some recon on reviews beforehand to see if portion sizes are consistently on the smaller side.\n\nAsk about upsizing options! Some restaurants might offer a bigger portion for a small additional cost.",
