      "text": "Over the past year, we‚Äôve witnessed remarkable growth in Ella‚Äôs musical skills and confidence. Your patience and enthusiasm have made each lesson both enjoyable and engaging. Here are a few highlights from this year:\n1. Enhanced Technique: Ella has demonstrated significant improvement in her overall piano technique. She is able to play more complicated piano pieces and play quite fluently. This advancement is a clear reflection of your effective teaching methods and encouragement.\n2. Boosted Confidence: We‚Äôve noticed a considerable increase in Ella‚Äôs confidence, both in her playing and her willingness to perform. She enjoys playing for me and letting me record her performances. She also takes the initiative to read and practice new pieces on her own before you teach them. I believe Ms Seah‚Äôs efforts of organizing recitals every year is having positive impact on her.\n3. Steady Progress: Ella has consistently improved her sight-reading and piano skills. She earned a merit in her Grade 3 exam earlier this year and is now preparing for her Grade 4 exam. Ms Seah‚Äôs structured approach in each lesson has been highly beneficial.\nWe especially appreciate her flexibility and understanding regarding Ella‚Äôs individual needs and learning pace. While she loves music, she can be quite impatient and has a short attention span. The teacher‚Äôs personalized approach has greatly enhanced her progress and enjoyment of the lessons.\nLooking ahead to the coming year, we are excited to continue this musical journey with Ms Seah and are eager to support Ella‚Äôs growth in any way we can.\nThank you once again for your dedication, passion, and the positive impact you‚Äôve had on Ella‚Äôs musical education. We truly value your role in her learning experience and are deeply grateful for everything you do.\nWarmest regards,\nWendy\nElla‚Äôs Mother",
