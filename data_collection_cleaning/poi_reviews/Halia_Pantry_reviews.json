      "text": "Excellent food at economical price!  The lemon grass prawn salad comes highly recommended. It is an explosion of flavours being sweet sour and tangy with chunks of mango and grilled turmeric prawns. The finely sliced ginger flower acentuates the dish further with the lemon grass. The seafood gratin is cheesy and creamy with smoked salmon making it a very satisfying meal. The chilli crab pasta is spicy with generous serving of real crab meat. It took quite a while to adjust to the idea of having to eat restaurant standard meal with disposable and flimsy plastic cutlery. Also hope the management will consider a more environmental stance by reducing the use of plastic.",
