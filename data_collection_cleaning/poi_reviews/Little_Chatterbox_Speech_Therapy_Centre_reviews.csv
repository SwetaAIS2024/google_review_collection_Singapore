Ryan,5,"Ms. Suat Chin Tee has been an excellent speech therapist with over 20 years of experience working with children.

In the beginning, it was difficult for my child to follow her classes, but she sought alternate ways to make the classes more engaging for my child to follow.

She also accommodated through online classes during an overseas job stint in the past year. When I returned to Singapore, I continued with physical class which my child has shown significant improvements in speech and pronunciation clarity.

I am grateful for her help and continues to work with her to achieve some milestones within the next few months.

Overall, I am satisfied with the progress for my child and strongly recommends to other parents seeking for speech therapy in Orchard, Central Singapore.

The clinic is conveniently located within walking distance to Dhoby Ghaut MRT (Circle Line, North-East Line & North-South Line).",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107768500291943923401/reviews

Rachel Hole,5,"We were so lucky to find Little Chatterbox. Our son struggles with articulation, so when we moved to Singapore from the US we wanted to make sure to get him in speech therapy as soon as possible. Suat Tee Chin is firm and takes a no-nonsense approach that really capitalizes on the time they have together each week. We have noticed major improvements in the 6 months he has been attending.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115907975849649785045/reviews
