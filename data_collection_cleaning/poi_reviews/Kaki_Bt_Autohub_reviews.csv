Sean Tan,5,Very happy with the professionalism of this workshop.  i always am sceptical of workshops other those from authorised dealers but decided to try this workshop recommended by my colleague so as to save some money.  The replacement of my air con compressor was professionally done and work was completed within the promised timing.  Boss Ah Hong threw in free filters some more.  The price is also very reasonable.  Strongly recommended.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100352354569691593292/reviews
