      "text": "Whoever Milind Sovani is, he sure has a huge ego to put his name on food this bad. Dryest, least flavourful Biryani I have ever eaten before. Serving size was okay, but the rice had nothing to it and only four smallish pieces of mutton for 16 dollars. The restaurant called to say they were out of a side dish and offered to replace it with the most authentic of Indian side dishes - deep fried cheese fingers. They tasted okay but I question the authenticity of this restaurant.\n\nEDIT: Looking at other reviews and pictures, it seems my Biryani was supposed to have come with a pot of curry to fight the absolute dryness of the rice. Guess what didn't come with my order? :)",
