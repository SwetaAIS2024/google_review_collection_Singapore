Navreet Kaur Dhillon,5,"We are deeply grateful to Dr. Sujit Gill for his exceptional kindness, patience, and reassurance during my father's recent consultation. His clear explanations (spider veins versus varicose veins), thoughtful answers, and gentle approach significantly eased our concerns, especially comforting for my father, who is over 70 and had numerous questions. Dr. Gill's sincere approach and genuine care through both his words and actions deeply touched us. Additionally, his generous gesture regarding my father's scan deeply moved us, reflecting his compassion and professional integrity. Special thanks also to his wonderful staff for their warm and attentive care. We felt welcomed, at ease from the time we walked into his clinic and so appreciate his warmth and professionalism and wish him & his staff continued success in his valuable work.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113605301013684683238/reviews

Jose Armando,5,"I had an excellent experience with Dr. Sujit. From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and at ease. He is incredibly kind, patient, and thorough in their approach and addresses my queries. Also  makes u feel at home with subjects unrelated to the issue. They took the time to listen to my concerns about my stomach issues, asked detailed questions, and explained everything in a clear and reassuring manner.

What truly stood out was their friendly demeanor and genuine care. They didn‚Äôt rush through the appointment and made sure I fully understood my condition and treatment plan. Their professionalism, coupled with their warm and approachable nature, made a huge difference in my experience.

I highly recommend Dr. Sujit to anyone looking for a compassionate and knowledgeable doctor.

Wai Yen Wong,5,"I consulted Dr Sujit about 6 months ago. He was very professional and patient in explaining the details of my medical condition. He was so reassuring that I decided on my first appointment to have him carry out the surgery.
Turned out, my condition was worse than what we anticipated from the scans. Dr Sujit patiently and delicately managed the surgery with minimal invasion.
The aftersurgery care extended by him and his nurses were well above expectation. The care demonstrated really put me at ease that all is well. Six months on, I have Dr Sujit and his staff to thank that I could enjoy life again.
Today, it was only natural for my husband and I to bring my mother in law to consult Dr Sujit concerning her medical condition. Dr Sujit was very professional in his approach to investigate her condition with us and we went home with a path forward that was certain and decisive. Dr Sujit, thanks to you and your staff for making my mother in law feel very comfortable and relax while she was at your clinic. üëçüëçüëç",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104644754280525044404/reviews
