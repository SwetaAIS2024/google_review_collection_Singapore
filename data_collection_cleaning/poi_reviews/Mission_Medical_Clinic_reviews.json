Iâ€™m sure you can find other clinics around with much better service.\n\nWas my first time here and the receptionist is extremely rude (should have read the reviews before coming) - Stared at me the moment she walked out and when I asked her about first time registration, she rudely gestured and pointed to the QR code located on the counter a little further. Did not ask if I was having a fever yet when she asked for the first time, she said I should have told her when she first asked. Was asked to come back 2h later and upon reaching, told me to come back again at closing time as there were too many patients. No chairs provided for fever patients so I ended up seated on the floor outside.\n\nGo for other doctors and other SASH clinics, there are way more empathetic receptionist and better doctors around. Worst experience and service ever, would not recommend this to anyone at all unless you want to experience bad service.",

The clinic ends it session on 12pm Monday and eventually give up waiting and have to try to struggle to go to another clinic after few hours of anxious wait. The clinic should know how to manage crowd and reject walk ins early for alternate planning. Very bad experience. Go only if no waiting is needed.",
