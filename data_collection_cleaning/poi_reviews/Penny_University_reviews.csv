Barat Vinayakan,5,"Great place, found it while walking towards Symmetry another breakfast place. Tucked away in the corner and had a nice vibe, had their Turkish eggs, Builders breakfast, waffles with maple syrup and coffee.
The waffles could have been topped with some whipped cream or ice cream and a more generous helping of maple syrup, it was overpriced at 15 sgd.

Brella Y,4,"It was our first visit with our golden retriever, and we were delighted to learn that, despite being halal, they welcome furry companions. The food portions were generous, and I especially loved their scrambled eggs. They also provide complimentary ice water, and the coffee was great. Outdoor seating at most cafe tends to be quite warm, even with fans, but this one had two large power fans, making it much more comfortable. We truly felt pamperedâ€”thank you for a wonderful experience!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107961269578762138575/reviews

Arjun Sood,4,"Absolutely smashing cappuccino, one of the top ones I've had in a while. Fresh, balanced, well prepared - just an absolute treat. Had the brilliant Penny's Benedict with the beet flavoured hollandaise. Watch out if you're going on a hot day though and get a table deep inside. Took one closer to the entry and was sweating profusely which made me cut my time short at this cafe. Will revisit though!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112771647438580081502/reviews
