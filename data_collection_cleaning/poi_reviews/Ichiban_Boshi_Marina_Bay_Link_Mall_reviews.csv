Sky,4,"Chanced upon this Japanese restaurant at Marina Bay Link Mall which serves decent Japanese cuisine. A little pricey perhaps it’s because we over-ordered for 2 pax , otherwise everything quite ok.

Tip: Marina Bay Link Mall has a dedicated carpark which provides easy access to all the restaurants inside.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100770304576606473090/reviews

Gem cai,5,"Quiet and lovely spot during the weekends. Visited twice, first with a group of friends and then on my own. Both times, service was excellent. They go around refilling tea and beverages and staff are always friendly and efficient when you request for condiments and assistance.

I love the grilled salmon head and the option for no salt added.

Only thing is the poor ventilation because the ceilings are rather low and it has this perpetual smoky smell.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108936225266166532481/reviews
Janet,5,"Waiting time was a little long given the dine in was on a Sunday late morning. Food is nice, portion is good too. The food choices weren’t exactly the same as the other branches in heartland malls though.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100573853464116740052/reviews
Joyce Lim,5,"Excellent service, felt so welcomed for lunch despite the outlet being busy. Best service I've had on ichiban outlets. Hire katsu was slightly tough and tasteless, but it was served with mustard, Tonkatsu sauce, and sesame seeds to be ground up. Side salad was refreshing and tasty. Free items if you have their membership card and accumulate spending. Every 20 bucks after ++ gets you one stamp. Lots of free items and can even exchange for cash voucher for next visit. Mini california maki was the free aka item this time round, very fresh and tasty. Salmon avocado handroll was an ala carte order, I remember it to be fresher, today's salmon was slightly stale. Overall a great place for lunch in cbd.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114306834103372851451/reviews
