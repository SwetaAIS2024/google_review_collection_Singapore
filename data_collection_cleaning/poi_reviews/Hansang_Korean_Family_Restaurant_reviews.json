      "text": "Jokbal (Pork Throttle) was a good n flavorful dish. Seafood pancake was ordinary, and only crispy on the outer side of the pancake. For the price they’re charging, the amount of seafood is certainly a let down. Pork Bulgogi was tender and bold but a tad too sweet for our liking. Tasted both versions of Makgeolli, we preferred the sparkling over the traditional non sparkling version. Overall the food is Authentic but the prices are slightly high. The potions are too big for dinners to order more dishes to try/ share. It’ll be a great ideal to bring down the portions n prices at the same time, so that dinners can order more varieties of dishes to share around, like in many other Korean Restaurants. It didn’t live up to our expectations of such high Google reviews.",

      "text": "Hansang serves truly authentic Korean food. Be prepared that the waiting time may be long, even when the queue is short. Although the prices are slightly higher, the generous portions justify the cost, especially when you opt for one of the many promotional sets. The food were very tasty, although we would prefer bolder flavours. The lady owner was very friendly. While free items were given for leaving Google review, this honest review didn’t take advantage of the offer.",

The service staff were very busy and rush with their service. The ginseng chicken was so so only. The saving grace was the banchan which had good variety and taste. The Korean owners were service oriented and friendly.",

The marinated pork also so so too\n\nAlso tried the bbq chicken set. Bean paste soup is not bad though abit bland with no meat taste. I find th  bbq chicken too burnt and they were very nice to change. Second batch is better but I find the bbq meat so so.\n\nI didn’t like their barley tea as it seem to taste off but i do for kimchi which is the fresh kimchi kind",

Not spicy at all too, so it was a very comforting meal :’) bonus to the friendly owner whom we had a great chat with~",
