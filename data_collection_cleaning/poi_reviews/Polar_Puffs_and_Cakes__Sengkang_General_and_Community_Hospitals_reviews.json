The curry puff however is expensive and without much filling as you can see from the picture. Don't think I'll come back again.",

I stood at the cashier there for awhile and the male and auntie staffs seem busy‚Ä¶ they saw me, but ignored at first‚Ä¶ so i thought to myself, maybe they are busy, so i shall wait‚Ä¶ the auntie, saw that i didnt walked away, asked me ‚Äúwhat u want‚Äù in non friendly tone. I showed her my order email and told her that im here for my cake collection. She turned her back away, told me she dont rmb got any cake collection. I explained to her that its a mango cake, and if she liked to see the email.her face turned black immediately, then from then, she muted all the way, from cake checking to asking me to sign the order paper. I can sense such a huge unfriendliness from this outlet. The guy staff also not helpful at all.\n\nTo add on, i saw the responses from polar are always we will improve and let us serve u better in next visit, since years ago‚Ä¶ i shall see if they will respond this again‚Ä¶ and be frank, seems like their service didnt improve despite so many ppl complaining‚Ä¶\nBad service for compassOne and sengkang hosp outlet.",

Save water as no washing is required  but bad for environment though‚Ä¶\n\nJust an average cafe but good enough to spend a couple of hours if you happens to be in SKGH.",
