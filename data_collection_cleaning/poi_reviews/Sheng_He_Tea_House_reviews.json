      "text": "Was recommended by friends to this coffeeshop at Blk 631 along Bedok Reservoir Road to try their Tze Char. We tried their $59 set dinner promo recommended for 5/6 pax. We were given choices to choose from each dish selection. The curry fish head was flavourful and most importantly, the fish was fresh. The salted egg yolk prawns was just nice, not overpowered by the strong salted  egg yolk. Marmite chicken was nice and crispy with a nice coat of marmite sauce, the sambal sweet potatoe leaves is nice too, tasty and not too spicy. Omelette taste almost the same everywhere. Overall the meal I would say is value for money. We enjoyed the meal and will come back again from time to time. üëçüòã",

      "text": "Nowadays, it is not uncommon to find dishes that are as good if not better than their counterparts elsewhere that are more publicised and popular. This is one of those. I have been eating claypot rice quite a bit lately and I am pleasantly surprised that this is so good. You can watch the claypot rice cooked from scratch. And the final product is nothing short of amazing. I like the quality of the rice cooked to perfection, with savoury lap cheong, tender chicken and pieces of delicious salted fish. Coupled with a hearty stew soup of choice for $8.80 in total, it is a really satisfying lunch treat.",
