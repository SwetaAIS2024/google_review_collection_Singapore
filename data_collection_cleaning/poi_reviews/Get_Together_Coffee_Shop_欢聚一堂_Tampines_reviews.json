There is a good variety of food stalls here, from noodles to nasi padang, western food, chai fan, roasted meat, chicken rice etc.\nWill order and try the food from the other stalls in our future visits.\nThe coffeeshop is clean and airy.",

The char Siew rice is the same operator at Old airport road hawker centre. Somehow the original stall‚Äôs char Siew seems to be better. Overall, a decent coffee shop to patronise with ample and easy parking. The Ang Mo mini mart is just few units away. The area has a bakery shop, dentist, clinic, Guardian, laundry shop etc.",
