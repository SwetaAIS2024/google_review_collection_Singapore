Abby Y,4,"Chose the restaurant for its spectacular view but it was raining so we asked to dine in instead. We arrived for early dinner, there weren't many customers but they were slow in getting us menu (asked twice), setting up the table and ordering drinks. Food was served quite quickly after the order was made. Each dish is well presented. The portion size was smaller than expected. Every dish was delicious, but not special. Kangkong wasn't spicy.
The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor dining area, with comfortable seating.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100797203657748541018/reviews
Jin L,5,"The food is delicious, the atmosphere is good, and the staff is friendly. It is a restaurant that makes you feel good. My child loves the bread so much that he ordered it three times. I couldnâ€˜t find a menu with shrimp and thin noodles, but I think the menu has changed a little. The chili crab is spicy but sweet, so I think the kids will like it. I personally like the chili, but it is really delicious when you mix it with the remaining seasoning and eat it with rice",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111989888697449964494/reviews
Jennifer Wang,5,"Literally our No 1 go to place for entertaining our guests or family gathering. The strategic location of this restaurant is 10/10. The iconic merlion is within 1 min walk, the breathtaking view of marina bay is right outside(if you choose outdoor seating).

Over the years we might have ordered all the things on the menu and it never fails to impress. Personally my fave crab is creamy crab. Its heaven if you like creamy taste.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107986140932546980153/reviews
Roque Merrick Dacullo,5,Food is delicious and everything is in healthy options. Friendly and accommodating staff. Price is high but it is all worth it. All expectations were met. So worthy of its reputation. :),4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106924467959873361056/reviews
Daryl Ong (TimeTravelTherapist),5,"My No.1 go to place for eating locally cooked crabs. Iconically located right beside the Merlion, by the One Fullerton stretch. Probably has the best crabs. These crabs they serve are fresh and full of meat. Price point is slightly on the higher side, but if you wish to enjoy delicious seafood, it is definitely a good to place. Not only the crabs are good, bamboo clams and prawns are also fantastic. And if you sit outdoors, you enjoy the Marina Bay Sands View like in the pictures. Personally i prefer the black pepper crab over the chilli crab, but both are equally good. Do make a reservation earlier to avoid disappointment, especially if you have a bigger group.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112205513111796980060/reviews
