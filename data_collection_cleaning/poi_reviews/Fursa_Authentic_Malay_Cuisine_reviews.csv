Nora Sariman,5,Enjoy my lunch greatly today. Only discover yesterday about this lovely place @ Midview Blk 18 coffee shop. A simple assam pedas with sardine fish since their assam fish sold out at 12 noon with stir fried sambal brinjal and nice crispy fried tempeh. Will be my regular stall now.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114822810789773723447/reviews
