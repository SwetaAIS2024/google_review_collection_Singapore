      "text": "These donuts truly live up to the reputation. Light, soft, and perfectly fluffy, each bite felt like a sweet little cloud. The burnt butter honey donut stood out, it tasted like a pancake topped with honey drizzle. The pistachio donut had the jam drizzle which didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark the jam and pistachio didn‚Äôt fully complement each other. The beef sandwich was just okay, tasted more like a McDonald‚Äôs burger with a simple patty instead of actual beef. The salmon sandwich instead is lighter and a better balance overall",

Had to control ourselves from ordering more.\nThe sandwiches were great too. Innovative combination of fresh ingredients, yummy sauce, and the bread was fluffy on inside and nicely toasted on the outside. Staff service was very friendly and cheerful despite being crowded and having to attend to many orders.",

We had the beef and tuna sandwiches, and both were delicious.\n\nAs for the donuts, we preferred the pistachio and chocolate ones over the original burnt butter flavour.\n\nOverall, the food was tasty, and the service was friendly and fast. The only downside is that the seating area is quite small and limited. Still, we‚Äôd definitely recommend checking it out!",
