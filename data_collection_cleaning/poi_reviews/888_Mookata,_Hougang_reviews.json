The ingredients were decent, the soup base was okay, and service was acceptable. Overall, it’s alright if you’re nearby and craving mookata, but not something I’d go out of my way for.",

Food here is absolutely delicious and the meltique beef cube has such delicious fat marbling, it kinda melts in the mouth when grilled! Garlic marinated pork and chicken taste really good too! Portion is reasonable here and service was straight forward and simple. Just scan the QR code to order.",
