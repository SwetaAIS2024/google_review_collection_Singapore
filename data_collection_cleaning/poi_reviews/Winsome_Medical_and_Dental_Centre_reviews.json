My wisdom tooth erupted and i was in pain so i called in at 9am to check if they accepted walk ins since the clinic is located opposite my house.\nFirst thing the women said otp, ‚ÄúAre you (some random person‚Äôs name)?‚Äù.\nNo hello and no good morning.\nWhen i replied no i‚Äôm not and that i was just calling in to check if yall do walk ins since its an emergency regarding my wisdom tooth, your staff replied, ‚Äúyou go somewhere else. We fully booked‚Äù\nLike okay, i understand if you guys are fully booked but there is a better way to say it. Also what a way to deter potential new customers. When i asked again if your clinic accept walk-ins even if its an emergency, she responded ‚Äúdoctor not in. doctor off. you go somewhere else‚Äù.\nWhat a rude response.\nEventually your staff did mention to ‚Äútry my luck‚Äù and walk-in tmrw.\nWouldn‚Äôt recommend this place lol.",
