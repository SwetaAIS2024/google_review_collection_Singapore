Ephraim Lin,5,"Dr Tan is an exceptional doctor who genuinely cares for his patients. He takes the time to listen attentively and always ensures that his explanations are clear and thorough.

His warm and approachable manner makes you feel at ease, even during challenging times. I am grateful for his care and highly recommend him to anyone seeking a doctor who goes above and beyond!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114627398352947469063/reviews
Chris Vera,2,"The doctor completely missed our appointment.  After going all the way to Alvernia, I find the door locked.  I call the doctor, he says his receptionist is off today and didn't check his calendar to see we had an appointment.  He was in surgery but apparently could leave it and make it back to the office in a while.

I ended up leaving.  If something simple like a schedule can be botched, I don't want to imagine what could happen to my body.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104406946494892431965/reviews
