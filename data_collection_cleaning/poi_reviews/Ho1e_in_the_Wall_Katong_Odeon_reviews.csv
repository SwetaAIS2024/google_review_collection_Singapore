lance kwok en Cheng,5,"A very cosy and nice,place to chill, and have a few drinks with your friends. Good for groups, and I've spoken to the guy at the mic, and he'll be here on Tuesdays and Fridays (entertaining you on your preferred song). Food wise, Bernie who'll more than likely to be tending to your table, will try to accommodate to your request of food orders, and assist in your orders. Definitely a nice place to chill at a reasonable price.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117361932774134204234/reviews
Mihir Vinekar,5,"A Cozy Gem with Exceptional Hospitality - ""Ho1e in the Wall"" Bar Review

My recent visit to ""Ho1e in the Wall"" was a delightful experience that exceeded my expectations. This charming bar stands out for its incredibly friendly and warm atmosphere, making it a perfect spot for both regulars and first-time visitors.

One aspect that particularly impressed me was the exceptional kindness shown by the staff, especially Sam. He was not only attentive and professional but also genuinely nice to talk to, adding a personal touch that is rare to find. His amiable nature and ability to connect with the customers truly enhance the overall experience at this bar.

When it comes to drinks, ""Ho1e in the Wall"" offers great value for money. The selection is diverse, catering to all tastes, and the quality of the drinks is commendable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101191141221610429622/reviews
