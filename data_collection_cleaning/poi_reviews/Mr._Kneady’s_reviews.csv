Ming,5,The place is only for takeaways. Simple menu. Short 10 mins in-store order wait or you can order pickup in advance on Grab. Nice sourdough pizza bread and generous toppings. Reasonably priced. Definitely be back again.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109226628464118431877/reviews

Ali Jumabhoy,5,"I loved the pizza here. It is absolutely delicious. Was intrigued by this little shop with no seating area in Ann Siang, finally picked it up for an office lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Pizza dough quality is extremely high and the flavours and options are innovative.

I hope this opens into a fully fledged restaurant because Iâ€™m sure I will be a regular! Canâ€™t wait to see what new pizzas the team here create.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112319499646182773120/reviews
Phyll Y.,4,"Tried the Remedy ($18) which is smoked chicken, red onion and mozzarella with a garlic sauce base. Two of us polished it off quickly. It's bit mild-tasting so I'd suggest adding a topping or two. The sourdough crust is spot-on though.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116766235154293681938/reviews
Jas,5,One of my favourite spots for pizzas and sourdough bread! Love how they thoughtfully slice and pack the bread into two half loaves with cling wrap. I actually prefer the bread here over the popular TBB ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117949273984026621551/reviews
