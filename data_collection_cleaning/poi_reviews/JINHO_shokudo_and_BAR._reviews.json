Tried their garlic fried rice with chicken cutlet, pork shabu shabu, beef shabu shabu & their spicy iberico pork jowl inaniwa udon (dry)! (We requested non-spicy) Portion sizes are good. Every single dish was tender, tasty, and memorable! üòã\n\nHighly recommend this place! Would love to gatekeep, but I want them to be successful in their business so I can enjoy it for many more years to come ;)",

Busy during work hours like lunch.\n\nSet lunches is reasonable priced.\n\nThe jap rice is not the best as compared to some others,  but ok!\nThe sashimi I had was really good.  Like it!\n\nThe tonkatsu (pork) and the chicken katsu, are dry. It seems a little over deep fried.  Recommend the chef to not over cook the katsu.\n\nThe chawamushi (steam eggs) is very good.  Yummy.\n\nOtherwise,  this place is decent and presentable for your meals.",

I liked the tsukene and sushi roll.\n\nEdit: after two further visits I'd recommend the grilled fish collar and pork skewers instead. (The menu was changed and the tsukene was no longer as good.) avoid the gyoza.\n\nThe sake is good. Not crowded on a Friday night. Service is good. Music is a bit too loud.",
