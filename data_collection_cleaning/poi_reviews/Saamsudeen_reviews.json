Saying 2 pratas can only give 1 curry? 1 prata kosong is $1.10 yet they refused to give even a small bowl of curry??\nAnyway, will never return as stall assistant was very rude.\nIf they can only give one curry for every 2 pratas then they should indicate as there is no minimum pieces of pratas needed. Very selfish and money minded hawkers üòè",
