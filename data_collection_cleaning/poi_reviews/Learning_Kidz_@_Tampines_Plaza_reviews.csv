J L,5,"As a parent, I am extremely pleased with my child's experience at Learning Kidz Preschool.

Teacher Germaine's dedication and enthusiasm have made learning enjoyable for my child, fostering both academic and personal growth.

Similarly, 穆老师‘s engaging Chinese lessons have been instrumental in developing my child's language skills, providing a strong foundation that has greatly facilitated his transition into Primary One.

The school's annual Halloween parties are a highlight, showcasing all the teachers' creativity and commitment to providing memorable experiences.

Teacher Sheila's engaging sports classes is something my child always looks forward to, and really helps in developing my child's physical skills and promoting a healthy lifestyle.

Teacher Cecilia and Teacher Maggie's leadership is evident in the school's well-organized programs and emphasis on holistic development (especially during COVID-19). I am grateful for the positive impact they have had on my child's early education journey.

We are very happy with our experience here at Learning Kidz, and thankful for having such caring teachers that made our child's preschool experience a great one. Thank you so much!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100498412545772186632/reviews
Audrey Yip,5,"I’m surprised by the bad reviews about CCA and teachers. My daughter spent 4 years there and she is really happy. The teachers are kind, the fees are extremely affordable, and the extra curriculum are completely optional. I compare Learningkids to mindchamp or posso I don’t find learningkids is at all non comparable, just the fee is way less. The only thing is learning kids have low teacher/student ratio, they follow MOE rules, whereas mindchamp has more teachers to take care of same number of students",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104240562398146358465/reviews

Alina Tan,1,"If your kids is mild on spectrum don't even bother to visit.. after speaking to a kind teacher 15mins on phone and they say they have similar kids and can cope so we schedule a visit. When visiting, another unkind lady simply just want to make her job easy.... it would be easier if you reject me straight on phone.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115700892257863698055/reviews
CW CHER,1,"Horrendous place. The principal is very toxic. Tells my niece this on her last day ""bye, I hope I won't see you again"". The school is all about sucking money from the parents by organising tons of extra curriculum activities. If you do not consent your kids to pay and go for the activities, they will be treated badly by the school. Be prepared to spend 100 to 200 more a month to let your kids take part in those ""extra "" curriculum"".",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105691573541795351187/reviews
