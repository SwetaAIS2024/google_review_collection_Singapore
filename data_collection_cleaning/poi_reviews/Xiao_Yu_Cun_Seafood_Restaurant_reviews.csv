Hongyi Sheng,5,"Been coming here since a few years ago and not sure why the ratings r not high bc this place is great! Portions r huge and food comes very fast, so don‚Äôt over order! Their ÂõûÈîÖËÇâ n skewers r very delicious, the grilled eggplant is very good n the huge pot of chicken was a feast to the eyes too. Their corn pancake that they toast against the pot became smaller over the years tho (shrinkflation :( )",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109425576648266202867/reviews
Eileen Oh,4,"Initially here for Chinese skewers and coincidentally found a place near me with the salted egg sweet corn dish!! Been looking for it at different Chinese restaurants but can‚Äôt find such a dish.

The taste / seasoning of the dishes are mainly on the heavy side which pairs very well with white rice.

Food portions bigger than usual/common SG local restaurants
Ambience - seems very local like what you can find in China, with KTV music system and VIP room

Will be back to try other dishes!",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102032025085129737526/reviews
