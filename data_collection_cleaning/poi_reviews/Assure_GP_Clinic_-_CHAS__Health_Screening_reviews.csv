Lin Jianhe,5,"I was feeling quite ill at work today. I discovered a new clinic that I had not visited before and decided to go there, as I was unable to walk any further. The clinic was very clean, and the nurse at the reception was very polite in guiding me through the registration process and handling it. I'm glad the clinic was highly effective. I was soon able to see the doctor and complete the process, including obtaining the necessary medication. It's worth noting that the receptionist nurse also offered me a mask for my runny nose and cough during the registration process. I appreciate the positive experience I had during my visit. Thank you.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115228280294723720111/reviews

Siyu Lye,5,I brought my 2yo child there to see Dr Charis. She was very gentle and knew how to examine my daughter without scarring her. The staff there are very friendly and approachable. One staff even came outside to look for me when she realised that I had left a medication at the counter. I appreciate that she came all the way to the carpark as I did not answer my phone.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110912496714101256136/reviews
