      "text": "There are four McDonald's at Changi: T2 (Public Area & Transit Area), T3 (Public Area), and JEWEL (B1F).\n\nThis one at T3 is in a quiet area, so you can relax and take your time. It's open 24 hours, which makes it perfect for late-night or early-morning flights. The place is always clean and comfortable, which is another big plus.\n\nThe menu includes classic items like hamburgers and Big Macs that you can find worldwide, along with some Singapore-only specials.\n\nDon't miss the local flavors like the Satay Burger, Ha Cheong Gai Burger, and Thai Milk Tea Frapp√© ‚Äî these are unique to Singapore and definitely worth trying!",

      "text": "Stopped by McDonald‚Äôs at Changi Airport Terminal 3 for dinner and tried the McChicken meal and Chicken McCrispy. The McChicken was fresh, with a crispy patty and just the right amount of mayo‚Äîsimple but satisfying. The Chicken McCrispy had a nice crunch on the outside and was juicy inside, definitely a good pick if you‚Äôre craving fried chicken.\n\nThe place is spacious with plenty of seating, so finding a spot wasn‚Äôt a hassle. Ordering was quick and smooth with the self-service kiosks, and the food came out fast despite the evening crowd.\n\nIf you‚Äôre in T3 and want a quick, no-fuss meal, this McDonald‚Äôs is a solid choice‚Äîhot food, fast service, and a comfortable place to sit and enjoy.",
