I did everything a week before I heading to the US, and US only requires Rapid antigens test 1 day before boarding. So I just walk in, paid, and they swab me, I waited 20 minutes for my hard copy result. Extremely efficient!",

They had a short queue but it moved fast. Queued at 6.15pm, done by 6.45pm. $65 + $10 festive charge. Received my certificate via email that night at 1am, faster than the 24h expected time! Reliable and super efficient üëçüèªüëçüèª Kudos to the team for working so hard even during holiday period.",

      "text": "Saw the reviews from other people. Found it kinda difficult to believe the reliability. But honestly, it was a smooth process. Book appt to be safe. My first time doing swab test, I thought they will insert it all the way into the nose. Even art test we have to insert into the nose deeper.  I asked the swabber whether is it normal. He said that's how it is done. So I was fine with it. It's so much more cheaper compared to other places. Only $65. Other places charged $77- $90 ++. And they also send it after 8 hours on the same day itself! Even though it stated 24 hrs! Amazed by the efficiency.",

The nasal swab was performed professionally, felt extremely comfortable compared to many I‚Äôve had in past. The 24Hr guaranteed result actually arrived email about 8hrs later which was a pleasant surprise.\nFinally do remember this place is located in People‚Äôs Park CENTRE (I went into the nearby People‚Äôs Park Complex by mistake first try). Happy Travels !!",
