Forest BK,5,"🍂The Venus Loop trail is part boardwalk and part natural (jungle) trail.
🍁The Boardwalk section leads to Hanguana Trail and Squirrel Trail, beginning from the Park's entrance.
🍂Continuing on, the trail will lead to Venus Link where you can proceed towards Drongo Trail and Tree Top Walk via Venus Link.
🍁If you choose to stay, the second part of Venus Loop is a natural (jungle) trail that loops back to the entrance of Windsor Nature Park.
🍂If you enjoy the more natural trail, this section is great for you.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
