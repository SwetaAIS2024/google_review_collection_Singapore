      "text": "My daughter attended PSSMK for her K1 & K2 years. We had switched her from her previous preschool in order for her to benefit from the Montessori style of teaching, which caters to the different needs of different students, as she has some learning challenges. I am very thankful to the teachers for their patience in guiding her, their care, and their attention to details. The teachers would go the extra mile to try different ways of teaching for students to better grasp a concept. We know our daughter was well looked after in school and that she was very much loved.",

      "text": "Our association with PSSMK spans five wonderful years, and as a family, we consider the school, its dedicated teachers, and the principal (Ms. Cheryl) to be an absolute blessing! PSSMK operates as a close-knit community, fostering a nurturing environment that feels like an extension of family. Both of our daughters have flourished during their time here, exceeding all our expectations in their development and achievements!\nAs parent of two daughters: one a proud graduate of PSSMK and the other currently thriving there, I feel compelled to share our journey with this exceptional preschool.\nWhat stands out most about PSSMK is how the program is tailored to suit each child’s unique pace and abilities. My elder daughter, who graduated, had her own learning rhythm, and the teachers nurtured that beautifully, helping her gain confidence in reading, writing, social awareness and math. We witnessed her transformation from a shy 2-year-old into a confident 6-year-old, ready to embark on her primary years in school. Now, my younger daughter is blossoming in the same supportive environment, excelling in motor skills and self-care. Just yesterday, she excitedly shared her plans for her first “Show and Tell” in February, and the shine in her eyes reflected the incredible work PSSMK does with its students.\nEvery term, the children explore a new culture, and this cultural immersion has been an enriching experience not only for our kids but also for us as a family. From Mexican tacos to counting in Japanese, exploring the flavours of Thai cuisine, celebrating Indian festivals, and learning about Chinese traditions—the list is endless. This approach captures the imagination of children and fosters a global mindset.\nThe independent projects undertaken by the children are simply remarkable, helping them develop communication within a group and critical thinking skills. A special mention goes to teachers like Ms. Liyana, Ms. Shirley, Ms. Faith, Ms. Qi, Ms. Angel, Ms. Hui Ling, and principal Ms. Cheryl, who have created a warm and inclusive atmosphere where every child feels valued. It’s heartwarming to see our younger daughter forming close bonds with the same teachers who once guided her sister.\nFor our elder daughter, the primary readiness program was instrumental in her seamless transition to primary school, and we are confident it will have the same impact on our younger one. The overnight camp for K2 children is another fantastic initiative, offering kids a memorable experience of independence and teamwork. Our elder daughter still fondly recalls it as one of her favourite memories.\nLastly, the Parent-Teacher meetings at the end of each term are highly personalized and provide valuable insights into our children's individual learning journeys. I still remember the 45-minute call post-PTM with Ms. Cheryl, where we discussed ways to support our elder daughter over the term break. As parents, we deeply value the detailed feedback and tailored guidance these sessions offer.\nThank you, PSSMK, for being such an incredible part of our children’s lives and for creating a community where they thrive.",

      "text": "I’d visited and called around 20 preschools before finally finding the only one that fulfilled my requirements: Paper Scissors Stone Montessori Kindergarten. My two kids have since graduated from PSSMK, and they both loved their time there.\n\nWhat we love most about this kindergarten is the team of nurturing and caring educators who have stayed constant through the years. The teachers spend a lot of time and effort building bonds with every child, and are very familiar with their different characters, strengths and skills. They’re able to customize learning to the child’s needs, and apply the right strategies to help bridge any gaps. Also impressive is the strong growth mindset shared by the team, and their consistency instilling independence and confidence in every child.\n\nPSSMK is very clean and well-ventilated, with no air-conditioning during class time (means it rarely has viral spreads). The preschool has a well-balanced approach, skillfully combining Montessori learning with knowledge of local primary school requirements.\n\nThe kids at PSSMK are well-adjusted, confident, and happy. They get along with one another and all have solid relationships with the loving teachers there as well. Kudos to principal Cheryl and her team for their dedication and hard work cultivating this safe, fun and educational space, which we’ve been fortunate enough to experience for more than 7 years.\n\n(Bonus: there’s a playground right outside the preschool, where kids can run about and play together before or after their session.)",

      "text": "My four children have attended Paper Scissors Stone over the last 7 years and I have only praise for all the teachers and principal, Ms Cheryl.\n\nThe program is a perfect balance of all areas of learning. It teaches motor skills, reading, writing, maths and general self care at the speed and capability of each individual. I really valued the importance of this with my kids, each of such varying ability.\n\nThe kids really enjoy the cultural element where they learn things like dance, art and cooking through a revolving focus on different countries around the world. The kids often want to delve deeper into these topics with me at home.\n\nAt the K1-2 level the kids are expected to do team lead project work as well as show and tell presentations which have been so great to encourage, team work, self learning and responsibility. My kids love these sessions and always talk about their work with such pride.\n\nI have watched my children and all the other students blossom into responsible, independent, respectful and very able individuals through their time at the kinder. I’ve very much appreciated the way the teachers create a warm, inclusive and caring environment between children of all levels. My kids each had such close bonds with their teachers. Ms Liyana, Ms Angel, Ms Hui Ling and Ms Shirley have been fantastic.\n\nThe teachers take time to write very thorough reports on all areas to give parents a good idea of what the kids have been learning, and how they are going. This often helps me understand more thoroughly what the kids tell me about. I like that during parent teacher meetings, the teachers will give fun helpful ideas as to how to help each child based upon their needs and try their best to prepare parents for the next step.\n\nMs Cheryl goes to great lengths to prepare a thorough program and continues each year to come up with new fun ideas to inspire the children. I’m most impressed with how she and the teachers are able to take on an overnight camp for K2 children each year. The kids gain a lot from the experience and it’s definitely a highlight at the end of their kinder experience.\n\nFinally I really appreciate how well prepared my children have been for their primary years. In K2, the children spend a term thinking about, researching, interviewing and learning regarding what to expect in primary school, which I believe has helped each of them to confidently look ahead to their next stage in life.\n\nPSSMK has been a blessing to our family and I can’t thank them enough for all that they have done for us.",
