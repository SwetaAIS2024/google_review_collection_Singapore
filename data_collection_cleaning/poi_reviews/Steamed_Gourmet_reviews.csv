steven lim,3,"Funan Mall branch - located inside the Kopitech, you are required to order and pay for the meals at various kiosks, and pick up at the stall when your number comes up on the board.

The food was hit and miss.  The steamed egg with pork was delish, and custardy in texture.  The pork patty did not taste overly fresh, or it could have been the fermented vegetables that was chopped and added inside.  The chicken was okay.  You have a choice of white or brown rice, as well as sides like cabbage with oyster sauce and salted vegetables, or braised peanuts.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117434407303387249783/reviews
Yong Sheng Ng (YS),1,"Bad experience. Worst pricing I've seen in awhile especially if you use fair price app. 10% discount only applied to takeaway charges, not the food items. First time encountering. Unlikely to return.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114603812666671986990/reviews
