Yew Chung Chee,5,"Nice cosy karaoke bar. Only 4 tables. More suitable for those who like to drink and sing. The shop is along the corridor inside the building, not along the street, so may be a bit hard to find. The building is near Tai Seng MRT station Exit A. The boss is nice and friendly.  Right now they have a promotion where you could get a bucket of 4 bottles of Heineken beer for $20.  Payment is by cash or paynow only.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109637640634901628234/reviews
