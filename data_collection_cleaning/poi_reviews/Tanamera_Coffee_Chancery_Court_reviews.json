Her coffee is always delicious and reliably consistent. I truly appreciate her exceptional service and dedication to crafting a great cup every time. The charming outdoor seating, with its quaint tables and chairs, creates a perfect spot to relax. Grabbing coffee from here has become an essential and cherished part of my morning routine.",

I have breakfast at this outlet twice a week (they sell pastries too) and always enjoy talking to Teresa, the very friendly and cheerful barista! She makes an awesome cup of mocha :) It's a great start to the morning.",
