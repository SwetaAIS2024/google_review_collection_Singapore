Managed only by Tower Transit Singapore, there are currently only 3 trunk-service buses running from this newly opened bus Interchange - 870, 871, and 992 that connects Tengah with Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak, Bukit Timah, and Jurong East.\n\nAs it is new, do expect least human activities as Tengah is still a live construction and the bus Interchange is meant to serve its first connectivity to other parts of Singapore.",

There are many things I find unique such as the exit numbering similar to that of an MRT station and the NTWU canteen which looks a lot more like a coffee shop! This bus interchange would certainly be VERY beneficial to the people who are living or are moving nearby. Looking forward to coming here in the future and more people around. For now, it's quiet and peaceful.",

The interchange, which has three alighting berths and six boarding berths and is managed by Tower Transit Singapore under the Bulim Bus Package, will have three bus services: 870 (to Jurong Town Hall Bus Interchange), 871 (to Upper Bukit Timah Road near Beauty World MRT Station via Bukit Gombak) and 992 (to Bukit Batok Bus Interchange). The vehicular access to this bus interchange is at the signalised intersection with Tengah Boulevard and the bus interchange, which sits on a site which is reserved for residential use under the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).",
