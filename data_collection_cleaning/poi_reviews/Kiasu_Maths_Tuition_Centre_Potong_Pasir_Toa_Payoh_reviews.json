      "text": "I send my P3 son there for maths tuition and he enjoyed it alot. No, he is not the studious kind who loves tuition. but he really enjoyed Teacher Horace classes. we have private tutor too but my son says that Teacher Horace explains better. Kiasu maths tuition centre has their own worksheets by topics but also go through other top school papers to make sure the students are on par with other schools. small group size, sometimes even one on one. what I love most about them is their flexibility on make up classes. I've tried many tuition centres and often frustrated about their rigid processes. our family travels alot and really appreciate this flexibility and not just miss and waste the class. Teacher Horace will communicate with me and work out something that works best for both parties.",
