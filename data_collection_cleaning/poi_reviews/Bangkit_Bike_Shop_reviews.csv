Dive Talking Lets Talk Diving,5,"Friendly mainland Chinese uncle who is probably a Singaporean PR now. Owns this shop and is efficient at fixing basic bike stuff. Not exactly cheap, but if you canâ€™t be arsed to get it fixed yourself, he will do it for you in a jiffy for a small price (including parts). Highly recommended!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115820149866263807656/reviews
Julin Yao,5,"My tyre cap broke and the air leaked totally, so I searched for the nearest bike shop and came upon this shop.

The technician was an old uncle with very little words. I told him my issue and all he said was ""have to change"" (the tube). And so he did it plus he checked my gears for me. All in all, only $10 spent for a tube and free gear check within 10 mins. Quick fix, and I learnt from him how to change it on my own during emergency.

As I have mentioned, he is a man with little words so dont expect very welcoming service attitude, after all you are paying cheap amount to get things done as well.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115247519167864874106/reviews

Sean Chong,5,Having issue with my bicycle and ask the owner to diagnose. Not only he explained what are the cause of the issue but also provide with the replacement option from cheap to higher price according to your convenience. The owner even gives some discount after the work. Is truly glad we have him on our neighbourhood.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100592693941645088546/reviews
Iftekhar Alif,1,The worst one in the neighborhood. Asked him in a friendly tone if he does servicing for bicycle and he literally ignore me. Customer service down the drain type. Not sure if he is interested in gaining customers or follow mood kind.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101604595663025964867/reviews
