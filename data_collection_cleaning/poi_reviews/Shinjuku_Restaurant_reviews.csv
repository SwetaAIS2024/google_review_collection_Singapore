Andrew XZ Lee,5,"Definitely a hidden gem in Singapore. The food is really close to what you can get in Japan or even better.

Definitely try the tofu with yam, salmon sashimi (super fresh), salads.

The pork udon is not bad but the hamburger omelette",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103214396992886699987/reviews
L Davis (SG),5,"Cozy izakaya place which I hear many Japanese visiting. walk in has a dining limit of about 90 mins, more than enough time. The most memorable dish was beef tongue soup, the broth was sweet with its fat and the tongue was so tender that you could ""laji"" with them. Sorry for the language, trying to be funny. Its chicken meatballs were just ma-ma so-so. Along with its grilled stick dishes, a little drier in meat. 5 kinds sashimi was good though, not too cold and the best cut was its salmon, it was so thick and succulent, wooden chopsticks can't hold it properly.. ðŸ˜†

Overall, a chill place you should try.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112234525476361740401/reviews
Bryan Tan,5,"I have been to this place multiple times over the years. Never fails to disappoint. Go for the standard bentos during lunch and the skewers during dinner. Canâ€™t go wrong. Most dishes here are very well made with great authentic flavour.

Tried the daily lunch special oyakodon today. Itâ€™s alright but could use a little more salty flavour.

You gotta book to guarantee a seat here. Walk in is possible but no guarantee. You can try to ask if have walk in seat. If no seat you can go to the isle cafe nearby.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100172346597544084544/reviews
LP Pua,5,"The restaurant opens at 5:45 pm for dinner and was immediately filled up, so reservations are recommended. We were pleasantly surprised when we were served hot towels after being seated. The food cost around $23 after adding the rice set to complete the meal. Most of the dishes were okay to good, except for the Tsukune. Overall, we enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews

My office relocated to the vicinity recently. I  have walked passed this restaurant countless times, making a mental note of visiting as it looks v authentic.

I feel like I am visiting Japan when i stepped in. Love the set lunches here. Super good value and good food. The staff looked like they have worked here foreverâ€¦ very experienced and brisk.

Am now a fan. Itâ€™s gonna be my regular go-to.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116804450051508415316/reviews
