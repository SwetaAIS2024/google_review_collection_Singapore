urmom lol,2,"service was amazing and fast and amazing place looks great to study and really clean
but the egg mayo croissant is awful how do u mess up a croissant like that
putting so many fibrous grains on the croissant that keep on dropping when i eat (annoying sia) is lowkey gross like i can tell itâ€™s trying too hard to be healthy till itâ€™s unpractical to eat and tastes like trash.
also the egg mayo inside is disgusting itâ€™s more of a over peppered tasteless piece of mushed omelette like literally all i taste is the pepper pieces and the pepper pieces are so big u can hear the crunch itâ€™s awful",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112014928956636875188/reviews
Enid Chen,4,"Love the vibes here, and as an NUS student who takes caffeine as life, I always welcome any coffee place on campus with study facilities (like big tables and plugs and wifi). So itâ€™s usually quite productive IF I am able to find seats. And during sem time, probability is very low, maybe 10% chance if you come in the afternoon. And as expected, everyone here stays for long hours.

Question to NUS FM/OSL: do students who donâ€™t get Starbucks get to sit here? I mean I get this is school compound and in general, all students can sit at any open space to mug. But I see more than half of the students sitting here not getting a Starbucks drink. Many times I buy a Starbucks drink and I had to go elsewhere to sit :( first come first serve > buying a drink at Starbucks?",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101948254186896558144/reviews
