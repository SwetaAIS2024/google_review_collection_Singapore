      "text": "I recently visited Pattaya Garden Restaurant and while the experience was good, it didn't fully live up to the expectations. The price was a little on the higher side considering the quality of the food. The green curry had a nice depth of flavor but wasn‚Äôt as aromatic or spicy as I would have liked. The tom yum soup was decent but lacked the strong kick I typically enjoy.\n\nOne positive was the fact that they offer halal options, which is great for those who need it. I also saw that they provide catering services, which could be handy for larger events. The omelette was good, fluffy, and tasty, though not spectacular.\n\nWhile the pandan dessert was a nice touch, it didn‚Äôt have the intensity of flavour I was expecting. The prawn dishes were decent, but not particularly noteworthy.\n\nIn terms of value, it felt like you were paying a bit too much for the portion sizes, especially considering the taste didn‚Äôt blow me away. Overall, it's a solid option, but I would only return if I‚Äôm in the area or looking for halal dishes specifically.",
