WH Koh,4,"Coffee is fine, had a Peru batch brew that was fruity and delicious. Can rival hand / individual brews at many other cafes, but there‚Äôs no seating here. Pricing confusions (bordering on scammy) abound below.

Store is in a challenging location: high football but numerous competitors with lower priced offerings within 5-minute walk.

Pricing confusion #1: banner advertised 10% cashback, but I didn‚Äôt get any cashback.
Pricing confusion #2: batch brew in store (chalkboard) was listed at 4.50/5.50 but the electronic board and online listed at 5.00/6.00.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107864752618195669210/reviews
Yu Ying,5,"Discovered volks back in 2020 and their soy matcha latte is still my FAVOURITE to date. (literally my no. 1 favourite place to get my matcha). Great umami and not too astringent. Super under-rated place for sure. (I do recommend trying them HOT to feel the ultimate MATCHA oomph üçµüçÉ).

Also, their new space looks amazing. It is spacious and comfortable. They are now open till late, as they serve cocktails and beers in the evening.

Importantly, great service from Will and Megan as always!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112666794698364973932/reviews
sungeun kim,5,"My daily coffee place near downtown MRT.
There is no seat (two chairs are available, but not suitable to stay and have conversation), so recommend to those who are okay with take out.
I love their coffee and genmaicha!
Price around $5 after using shopback :)",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115173260868591998953/reviews
Rachel,1,"Not a great first experience, probably will not return ever.
Staff here are unnecessarily curt and rude, their attitude, chitchatting and lack of training really shows. Makes you feel like you owe them a living.
The signage for where to order is really unclear. Wouldn't it make more sense to put the cashier area nearest to the entrance? Or at least put a sign saying ORDER HERE. Instead of some vague, unclear sign saying order over there, followed by collect here. If you can put a sign saying collect here, you can put a sign saying order here.
No sleeves for hot drinks provided.
The quantity of the drink here is honestly little and so expensive, compared to say the cafe at Marina One or Huggs (which are miles better). The drink is also lacking in any flavour. There are better cafes with better service staff and better drinks elsewhere in the area. I can't understand why people patronise.
