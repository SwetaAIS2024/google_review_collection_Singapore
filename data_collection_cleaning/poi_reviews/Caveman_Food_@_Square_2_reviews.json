      "text": "Who say healthy can't be tasty? Hard to find true paleo options and this is one of them. Food is tasty, chicken is tender and just falls off the bone. I've tried both Morrocan and Mediterranean flavours, both are good. Baked eggs are delicious too. If u looking for tasty food without sugar, msg gluten, this is the one. Only gripe is limited seating which is fine if you are eating alone. Price is OK compared to restaurants but of course pricier compared against Hawker Western food.",

      "text": "Update 16 Feb 2024: looks like itâ€™s closed down. A new store called Ton coffee operating now instead. Iâ€™m not sure if Caveman is closed down or moved to other places. Oh man Iâ€™m gonna miss their GF food so much! Where else to find yummy and affordable GF food in novenaðŸ˜­\n\nOld update: owner has new item called Beer Braised Chicken which itâ€™s NOT gluten free. They still serve the usual paleo GF food series, itâ€™s just the beer braised is an additional new to menu that he is trying to serve a wider audience. He also took down those posters that used to label gluten free/no dairy/no grains/no sugars etcâ€¦ Folks who are sensitive to gluten (or celiac) please do take extra caution on this as he said everything is handled & prepped in the same facilities kitchen. Also, price has increased since I last reviewed here 2 years back. Now for a 1/4 set meal costs about $13/$15 (dine in / grab delivery).\n\nOld review :\nLimited choices but itâ€™s good enough someone who has food allergies. Glad that its gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, no msg, no artificial flavouring, no grains.\n\nHad 1/4 chicken with Italian rosemary & thyme as flavouring (with a hint of lemon and you can choose the flavour btw), cauliflower rice ( note that thereâ€™s carrot in it), and baked sweet potato (Im not sure is there a coat of honey on the this as the skin was a lil glazing hard and sweet). Total $10. Overall quite like it and will come back again! :)",

Cauliflower rice was cooked just right and not so mushy unlike what I've tried in other more expensive restaurants.\nThey have just a small dining area though so it's good for getting a quick lunch fix.",

      "text": "Despite the price increase, I'd always stop by for a chicken thigh and some paleo sides when I'm around the area. A portion of their Quarter Chicken with Two Sides used to be priced at about $8 5 years ago but it's now $11. It's well worth it though, as the quality has remained consistently good and there's with no paleo/keto options around. My go-to would have to be their Italian Chicken, well marinated with a medley of spices and lemon juice. I don't even complain that everything is served on disposable plates and cutleries. Hey, at least they use the biodegradable sort and I promise you, the tender chicken falls off its bone so easily, all you have to do is to gently scrape it with your fork. The baked mushrooms/celery/onion/carrot dish looks unimpressive but is really one of the best western sides I have tasted anywhere in Singapore. I tried recreating it at home but could not get the exact same taste. The eggplant rasam is one of the more recent additions and it's mild on the spice and is so greasy smooth and easy to swallow. The sweet potatoes here are honey-sweet with almost non-existent fibres, I feel almost guilty ingesting them. It's a mystery how they process their food. Everything is so simply done that even a casual staff can prepare it with no discernible discrepancy in taste. The caveman might be a food scientist or an SOP maniac. Don't close down!",
