Rachel Yong,5,"My favourite ¥ðgï place.. My second home 🧘‍♀️at all time!!! 💚 love Instructor War War to the 爪卂乂 cause she is very detailed in providing adequate guidance in ensuring right posture is being practice with frequent reminder of breathing!

Love that OhmSantih hold small classes so that teachers are able to work in more detail with individual students.

Do come prepare to get sweaty and feel 𝕣ꫀᠻ𝕣ꫀડꫝ at the end of every single session! 🥰

Yoga without air con can be surprisingly good! You've got to try it in order to believe it! 🤗

Rajesh Rajamanikam,5,"Over the past one year, I have taken a number of classes at OhmSantih Yoga. The classes are taught by professionals who take care to teach to the needs of the individual participant. One of the best benefits of OhmSantih Yoga is this feature, small class size taught by caring staff like Ms Tammie, who is an amazing Yoga instructor. OhmSantih is a great place for yoga and for individualized attention.I will highly recommend OhmSantih Yoga to anyone who’s looking to learn and practice yoga.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110273949050063722408/reviews
Joy Ho,5,"I’ve taken private yoga therapy classes twice with Teacher War War at OhmSantih Yoga and felt that they have been beneficial for my health and healing. Teacher War War is extremely friendly, approachable and always takes time to fully understand my problem areas before recommending a series of yoga poses that can help manage my symptoms. She also focuses on ways I can easily incorporate yoga into my everyday life with photos and simple instructions. I’ve recommended her classes to friends and relatives who also agree that she’s professional and knowledgeable. Thank you, Teacher War War for the enjoyable yoga sessions!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115551253003955034422/reviews
Summer S,5,"I have many memberships with other studios that are more commercial and fitness focused, but OhmSantih is a place that I will always come back to. The studio is great for students who want to learn and practise yoga with it’s true essence; great for those who want to feel better in their body and mind (or have an injury / condition). Also highly recommend the prenatal yoga and kids yoga here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109853559211851825014/reviews
Joan Wee,5,"I found Ohmsantih 2 years ago as I was looking for a nearby cozy boutique studio to get away from home and work during COVID. As a newbie, I started with their drop in flow classes and eventually move to Ashtanga Beginner then Ashtanga Intermediate & Advance. In the past 2.5 years, I've seen myself improve significantly, unlocking new poses and still learning about myself on every practice with them. I have to say I fell in love with yoga because of all the teachers I've practice with through my journey here and not to forget - the small class size where you get the attention from the teachers to help you push through your practice each time. Teachers in Ohmsantih are super friendly, humble & knowledgeable! If you're looking for a non-commercial yoga studio, strongly recommending you to try out Ohmsantih!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109390142904595839794/reviews
