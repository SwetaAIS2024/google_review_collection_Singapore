K Tan,3,"Very solid tasting chocolate based cakes. Sweetness is just right and chocolate content is quite high for most of their cakes.
2 slices cost @ $30 so enjoy it slowly.
Seating area is cramped and limited.
It's a shame the server cannot offer complimentary plain water.
Cost $3.50 for water.

T Lo,4,"Famous for its chocolate.  The shop was small and housed over 10 tables.

Staff are busy in preparing drinks, serving cakes and manning the cashier.  They are polite and friendly overall.

70% chocolate drink is very nice and smooth.  Personally I would prefer a thicker texture.  Black Forrest Cake is large and great for sharing.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116313205053057135328/reviews
Tong Peng Tan,5,"Decent afternoon tea at Awfully Vivo. The Tiramisu here is very delicious, 70% hot chocolate was on point (thought a bit sweet) and the dark chocolate ice cream provides a relaxing and chilled experience.

Overall, a nice place to catch some drinks and desserts for chill out. Thumbs up üëçüèªüëçüèª",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104377483463053572464/reviews
