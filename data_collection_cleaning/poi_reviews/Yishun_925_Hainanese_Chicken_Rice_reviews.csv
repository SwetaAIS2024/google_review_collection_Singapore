Kayden Choo,5,"Went on 2 different occasions, the standard and quality were consistent. Very soft and tender meat that almost melts in the mouth. The soup is not the usual peppery taste kind that most chicken rice stall provided, theirs has got a rich taste of chicken broth.

Chicken drumstick (without bone) + egg, only $6. Very value for money.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111046245288496998971/reviews
Rio Wang,4,"Tempted by a friend for the chicken curry noodles, basically curry with Hainanese white chicken and noodles. It's fairly decent and tastes alright, not wow, not too bad either.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103067140074042430707/reviews
Deming,2,"Dropped by at 6:45 PM to buy chicken rice, but the staff refused to sell, saying there was no more chicken. Strangely, there was still one whole chicken hanging there, but they told me it was only for customers ordering half or whole chickens.

Found it quite amusing how this store does business—apparently, they’d rather turn away customers than sell what's left. Not exactly the most customer-friendly approach.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104497591180122525539/reviews
Serene S,1,"Chicken rice so so but charged at premium price. Ordered chicken breast meat. Ask how much to add meats. Staff says $7!!! I asked how much is the normal chk rice, was told $5! So i asked, your price list indicated $3.50/$5??? Staff say $3.50 is small plate, THEN WHY ASSUME CUSTOMER WANT $5!!!!! Ordered $5 but chicken is so little! WHY CHARGE CUSTOMER AT HIGHER PRICE BUT NOT WILLING TO GIVE MORE CHICKENS??? WILL NEVER PATRONISE THIS STALL AGAIN.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113057558941042022526/reviews
