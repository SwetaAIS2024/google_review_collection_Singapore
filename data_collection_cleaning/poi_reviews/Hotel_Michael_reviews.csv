Alan Ferrié,5,"I would rate the room as a 4 stars hotel as its kinda old if you dont have a newly renovated room. Our first room given was feeling very old but clean, I asked the front desk if they had a better room and they provided me with an awesome renovated room on the 10th floor.
Great breakfast but a bit far and hard to find to be honest.
Location is fantastic, 3 minutes from the Universal Studios Gate.
Had a great stay.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102321518645806782707/reviews
meme didi,5,"I had a fantastic stay at Hotel Michael, Singapore! The hotel’s artistic design and elegant ambiance made my experience truly special. The room was clean, spacious, and well-equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay.

The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, always ready to assist with a smile. Especially Mr. Hari, who went above and beyond to help us during our mistake—thank you for your kindness and excellent service!

Thank you, Hotel Michael, for your outstanding hospitality! I will definitely stay here again on my next visit to Singapore.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106558477356763733786/reviews
Irene Xu,4,"Had a comfortable stay at Hotel Michael in Dec 2024. Chose to stay here as we had plans to visit a few places on Sentosa Island. There is no doubt the location of the hotel is amazing. With a very short walk, we were already at the centre of all the tourist attractions. The rooms were simple, with all your basic needs present. As we were exploring Sentosa Island most of our stay, the simplicity of the rooms was not a problem at all. My favourite thing was that the minibar was replenished daily and had a great selection of drinks. We were celebrating my birthday as well and Hotel Michael had a small decoration in my room upon check-in which was a lovely surprise. Will stay here again next time!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110387349644320647268/reviews

Ramyeon,1,"Should let us rate negative stars.

Health Concerns Ignored by Staff at Hotel Michael.

I recently stayed at Hotel Michael at Resorts World Sentosa, and my experience was both disappointing and frustrating. Despite informing the staff that I have a sensitive nose and was experiencing severe nasal blockage every time I entered the room, nothing was done to address the issue.

The air-conditioning system in the room was clearly not well-maintained, and the poor air quality significantly affected me. What’s worse, my child also suffered due to the unclean air. It is unacceptable that a family-friendly hotel would allow such conditions to persist, especially when health concerns are brought to their attention.

Despite it being a non-peak period, the staff didn’t even offer us the option to change rooms. This lack of care and responsiveness was deeply disappointing and unprofessional. A hotel of this caliber should prioritize guest health and ensure that air-conditioning systems are regularly cleaned and maintained.

As a parent, I was extremely upset by the lack of action. My child’s well-being was affected, and this ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing stay for our family.

I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and implements proper maintenance routines for the rooms and air-conditioning systems. Additionally, staff should be trained to handle guest concerns with empathy and urgency. This experience has left me questioning whether I would ever return to Hotel Michael or recommend it to others.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103845468802303828882/reviews
