parmod kumar verma,2,"Went there today and ordered one Soya latte and one vanilla latte. Vanilla latte came as just latte. When told staff they just put a shot of vanilla essence. No apologies. Secondly I don't see any effort in up selling. 3 staff,  all look busy but cafe not busy. Very flat experience",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107332916602491205126/reviews
Lynn Ng,2,"Honestly I didn’t really want to be that person but the service I seen from the 2 ladies were uncalled for. I was just trying to order a drink but the ladies were visibly annoyed to take order. The lady with the black apron took my order and was really reluctant to take it. It was as if I did something wrong and she was just unhappy that she has to do her job.

Although I rated 2 stars, I’d like to rate a 5 star for the male staff that had to fix all the drinks on his own while the 2 ladies chat away. They DID NOT offer any help at all. I could tell that he had been working away alone by the way they are not communicating. I for one do not tolerate workplace bullying so I hope this is not it.

Please do something about it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105203757518766329073/reviews
Ronnie Yeo,5,"Starbucks is living to its mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time. I have always enjoyed patronising at this outlet for meetings and some quiet time. The staff are always friendly and joyful. I am appreciative that some of them even remember my name.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104059237242564827391/reviews

Skye Cai,3,"Drink tastes exactly the same.
Service is very bad.
Environment wise is quite normal too.
Not much merchandise selling here",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
