I liked the vibes from this place as there was nothing too fancy. The staff were amazing though very polite and friendly. If you own a dog and your nearby do try visit this cafe.",

From pasta to ham & cheese croissants, matcha lattes, and chicken chop‚Äîeverything we tried was delicious. They even serve food for dogs, and my pup Mochi couldn‚Äôt get enough of the Porkalicious! One portion wasn‚Äôt enough!\n\nGreat food, a cozy atmosphere, and a perfect spot for pet lovers. Highly recommend and will definitely be back! üêæ",
