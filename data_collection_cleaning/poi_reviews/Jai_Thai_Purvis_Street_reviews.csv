Tom,4,"I went in February 2024.

The staff is kind and speaks well English, which is always appreciated. I went there with the Air France crew for dinner on the evening of our arrival. It seems like this place is quite popular among airline staff.

The food was excellent. I had the green chicken curry on one visit and noodles on another. Both were delicious, nicely spiced, and generous in portion size. The price was fair for the quality and quantity of the food.

I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great Thai food.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116575442147866105723/reviews

Charlie Ooi,1,"The food was extremely disappointing. The fish and vegetables were way too salty, completely ruining the taste. Rice dry and cold like left over rice. The prawn seemed undercooked as well, which is unacceptable. Even the tom yum soup was overloaded with salt. This is really poor quality, and I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102156542869922902355/reviews
Ooi Ee Ting,5,"Nice air-con place to beat the hot weather. I ordered the kang kong vege, red curry chicken, basil beef rice and tang hoon.
Red curry chicken is sweet and very creamy and filled with generous amount of chicken. Saw a lot of recommendation on tanghoon, and yes it is as per reviews - delicious!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113154506027423915752/reviews
Tabitha,5,"There is a dedicated menu just for vegetarians, with super wide range of options and delicious authentic thai flavours. Really accessible from Suntec area. Highly recommend their Green Curry & Thai Mango Salad that was refreshing & tangy. Good for both group and individual meals. But restaurant interior lighting can be quite dim. Along the shophouses so its expected that there is not much seating space, but sufficient- since unable to reserve seats, seats availability depends on timing you visit.
Probably price of a zichar store",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110750330489234379036/reviews
