      "text": "Had breakfast here multiple times, especially on rainy Sunday mornings.\n\nTrue to Paris Baguetteâ€™s style, ordering is fuss-free, the food quality remains consistent, and portions are well-balanced, satisfying without feeling heavy.\n\nMy favourite is the salmon cream cheese croissant, which has just the right amount of cream cheese to complement the salmon without being overpowering cheesy.\n\nSeating is limited, but on weekend mornings, there is no crowd, making it a peaceful spot. Its open-air location within the mall is a plus, keeping it away from the oil-heavy aromas of Ya Kun and Fun Toast.\n\nA great place for a relaxing breakfast on weekends.",

My mum and I love their chewy mochi cheese sticks which is part of their $10 deal so weâ€™ve been coming almost daily buying them ðŸ˜‰\n\nFriendly staff at the outlet and they patiently explained the different breads to me.\n\nSpecial mention to Vincent who is the Assistant Manager there. Thanks for taking the time to assist us",

When confronted, he said, I thought you were with the other person when obviously that OTHER PERSON has long gone. What kind of observation is that?????\n\nOh yes, No wifi. Asked to connect to mallâ€™s wifi but zero signal. Situated right at the entrance where the external heat can enter. Worst outlet.\n\nCame here only because STARBUCKS CLOSED DOWN ðŸ˜­ will not come back to parkway anymore.",
