Esmond Chun,2,"Typical coffeeshop offer the dimsum.  Usually I only eat from restaurants.
Ordered 3 pcs of items, fried prawn dumpling, fried Carrot cake and red bean paste sesame.
Firstly, all item are just lightly warm and not serving hot.
Prawn dumpling giving a small shrimp and a bit of ""fish"" paste. Carrot cake doesn't find any ingredient and red bean sesame is total a failure, the skin is thick and hard, the red bean paste is very dry.
If just to fill up the stomach I think it just OK. As they charge $3.00 for 3 pcs.
This morning, I spent total $4.50 include with one coffee. It is expensive.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113754482951461644092/reviews

Clo’s Laobu,5,"Found this gem in Google map. Went on a weekend afternoon, the coffeeshop is not crowded and I ordered a plate of beehoon, pork liver mee pork , laksa , chicken rice and wanton mee.
Strongly recommend to order the pork liver mee pok. The liver is soft and tender. It’s cooked nicely. Chicken rice owner is very friendly. He gave a big bowl of soup for my kids and generous in the servings. Too bad I didn’t take pictures of it as they are too hungry.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114142484779850595642/reviews
