Personal favorite is the Mee Siam but it is seldom ready when I am there for breakfast. The payment and receiving change for the drinks is \"self-service\", unless you are paying with $10 and above.",

When my wife ordered the char siew bun, he was frank with her; that it was just delivered and is not hot enough.  He has a lot of regulars... hear him conversing jokingly with one of the lady customer... calling her \"dear\" and she responded jovially as well.",
