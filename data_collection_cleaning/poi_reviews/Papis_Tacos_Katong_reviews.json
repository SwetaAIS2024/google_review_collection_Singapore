The dining space is quite small and a bit warm inside, so it may not be the best option for large groups. However, the service was top-notch‚Äîfriendly, welcoming, and attentive. A great little spot for a casual and satisfying meal.",

Loved the Holy Trinity starter, refreshing cactus & broccolini salad, and the tacos were amazing ‚Äî especially the cheesy, juicy quesabirria. Drinks like the tamarindo and horchata were a nice surprise too. Definitely worth a visit!",

      "text": "If I could give more stars, I would! My boyfriend and I came in just to grab a quick bite but ended up in a full-blown food coma because the SHRIMP TACO was out of this world. It was really amazing! We were so busy stuffing our faces that we literally forgot to take any photos. That's how you know it's real.\n\nHuge shoutout to Joey, the absolute legend of a staff member, who saw us drooling over the menu and swooped in with taco wisdom. She recommended the shrimp taco, and after that first bite, we basically said, ‚ÄúJoey, take the wheel,‚Äù and ordered half the menu. She was so sweet, helpful, and gave us amazing recs that did not miss.\n\nAlso, bartender‚Äîwhoever you are‚Äîthank you for the drinks that made us feel like we were on vacation in our own city. I don't know what kind of sorcery you put in those cocktails, but we are grateful.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a taco fan, or even just have taste buds, RUN to this place. Five stars, ten tacos, no regrets. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

We also tried the Cheese Quesadilla (just cheese, great for non-spicy eaters), Beef Brisket Tacos (thick and juicy beef brisket!) and the corn. Everything was delicious and I‚Äôll be back! Ambience and atmosphere is casual and relaxed, great for a chill evening.",

      "text": "Fish tacos are bomb! Shrimp tacos are close behind. The spicy mango margarita was such a delight too ‚Äî the spice was such a good kick alongside the cold sweetness. We thought the meat dishes (smoked pork belly and beef brisket) were towards the dry side and could be improved.\n\nService is really great here. Shout out to Andre and Syed for helping us get happy hour prices despite missing it by a few minutes cos our table was still occupied ‚Äî our entire table ordered drinks because of it!\n\nLighting could be annoying to some, with the hanging decor blocking the light every few seconds, creating a blinking effect.\n\nSeats are limited so reservations recommended.",
