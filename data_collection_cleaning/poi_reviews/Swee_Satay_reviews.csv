Daniel,1,"Swee Satay also sells carrot cake. It's terrible. A plate for $3.50? A rip off. Doesn't it look unappetizing and horrible?

Try Hup Send Hokkien Prawn Noodle instead. Way tastier and better value.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100196593170329614557/reviews
LP Pua,4,"Our go-to place to order satay for parties and celebrations. Ordering by phone and collecting later is convenient. Priced at 70 cents per stick, it's affordable. The satay gravy is delicious. The satay is generally good, though occasionally it can be a bit hard.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Ant,5,First time here in this area. Hardly come across Satays seller nowadays at residential coffeeshop. Ordered to try. Price starts from $0.70 per stick.

Wang Teck Heng,4,"Taste was just average for me. I wished the meat seasoning was richer and the peanut sauce could be thicker. Tried the pork and chicken satay, the portion on each stick is a little smaller than what you get elsewhere, the satay was also not smoky enough to make it top grade. The fact that satay is served in a coffeeshop does make it convenient. Maybe if one eats it often, it could be a really good satay for them.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104861192728726319756/reviews
