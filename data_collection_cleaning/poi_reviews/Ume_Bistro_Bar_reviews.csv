Eldor Abdurahmonov,5,"I recently had an amazing night at OME BISTRO BAR ! The atmosphere was lively, and the song selection was fantastic. What really made the evening special was the outstanding service from the bartender, Deana. She was friendly, attentive, and mixed the best drinks Iâ€™ve had in a long time. Deana's positive energy and professionalism truly elevated our experience. I highly recommend this place for a fun and memorable night out!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109453173052777121176/reviews
