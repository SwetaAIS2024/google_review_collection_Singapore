You can order butter toast and half boiled eggs here as well from the drink stallâ€¦.just make sure to ask for real butter since they tend to just use Margarine. Just your typical sleepy, slightly dirty coffeeshop. Parking is very easy to find since there is a big carpark right in front of the coffeeshop. Oh and I donâ€™t recommend using the toilet hereâ€¦filthy af.",
