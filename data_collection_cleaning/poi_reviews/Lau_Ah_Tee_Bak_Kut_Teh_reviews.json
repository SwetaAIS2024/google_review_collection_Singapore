Did not really like the pork trotters as it was little too dry. Good attentive service and reasonably priced. Also a good selection of fish to complement your meal.",

Definitely not worth the price. After we have highlight to them on the pork knuckle, she return with a bowl of pork and sarcastically said there is enough meat and skin in the bowl. I definitely won’t be coming back for sure. Please refer to the pic I have enclosed this is what they have serve us.",
