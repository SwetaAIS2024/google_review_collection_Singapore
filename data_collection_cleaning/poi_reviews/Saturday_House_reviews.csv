Al Right,5,"We were taken to this restaurant /Cafe by our Singaporean hosts for business lunch on a Friday. Menu has plenty of different options and I had the opportunity to try number of them. All dishes that I tried were delicious, steak I ordered was done the way it was requested. It has a warm and casual welcoming atmosphere.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105184277258784012238/reviews
Yin Hwa Wan,5,"The food is excellent, complemented by a pleasant ambience and good service staff.
I have been there several times (on almost every Wednesday since January 2025 as I enjoy the particular pair of musicians' performances) and ate quite a variety of dishes from their menu.
Last night, I ordered the bacon mushroom bombs and oven baked cheese nachos. I have posted a picture of the bacon mushroom bombs here.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116433989279868907248/reviews
Laine Lui,4,"Suggest to book beforehand - was lucky to have gotten a table, but saw that they had to turn away some people as the tables were reserved.

Satay is a must try! Meat was well seasoned and tender, and coupled with the sauce - UMPH!
The Tom yum pasta was creamy and a bit spicy; gotta it eat before it gets cold and heavy.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101567132677209992181/reviews
Robin Chen,3,"Food wise - as expected. But the salt and pepper calamari that it claims, I didn't taste much of it, but more of spice powder rather than salt and pepper and the overly battered.

Service wise - as expected, they are attentive and quick to react.

Atmosphere wise - would be perfect if I knew that the live band only perform on wed and fri.

Overall, would visit again for the ambience and warmlyness. But would be on a live band performance day.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113747206766088215685/reviews
