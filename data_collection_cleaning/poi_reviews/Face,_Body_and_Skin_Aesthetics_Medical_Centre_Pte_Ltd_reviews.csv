Elaine Ong,4,I went to Q aesthetics and the experience under the hands of Dr Chris Looi was excellent. Everything was explained thoroughly and the doctor took the time to address my concerns. There was absolutely no down time at all! The only reason why I’m giving this four stars is because the staff at the counter bungled up on the appointment time and I ended up waiting a full hour. I must admit it’s a little pricey but at least I know I’m in good hands and am assured of the quality of the products used. I highly recommend.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108896560386963735971/reviews
