Totally no communication between their own staff. They make it seem like patient and family have no other choice, and lie to both sides and nv pass the message truthfully. Say 1 thing to patient and say another thing to family member and then cause confusion to both sides. No accountability. Unprofessional. Only chasing for money very on. Ask for update from doctor take so many days. Avoid this place if u can. Zero stars.",

Pinoys nurses are rude to cleaners, visitors, defendless patients and internship students. Pinoys knows how to bootlicks complaintive patients so that they can get compliments for themselves to get a chance of promotions or PR status. They are very jealous and arrogant creatures. You might get Xenophobia in this hospital environment! Stay away!",

When it's time for a haircut after a mth there, they missed my dad & I had to send a mobile hairdresser up. Nurses & attendants  there got not much initiative though they may appear caring. They put 8 patients to a ward - very crammed. I don't deny they have alot of attendants but mostly low-waged foreigners.  They can't understand the dialect speaking patients' needs further frustrating patients in the furnace like environment. On top of that, they charge $100+ per day!!! How on earth did they got a rating of 4.3 / 5.  I was told they're now  undergoing an air-ventilation improvement project. Until then rethink your decision of putting your love ones there.",

Initially I was concern of her welfare, however my concerns were allayed as the staff at ward Respect Station 3 were caring, patience and passionate in looking after their patients, especially the doctors, staff nurses, therapists, healthcare staff and volunteers. Your effort in helping my mother's recovery process is much appreciated.",
