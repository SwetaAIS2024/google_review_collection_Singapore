Kah Yong Low,5,"Outstanding Service and Memorable Experience!

I had the pleasure of visiting Major 99 recently and was thoroughly impressed by the exceptional service I received. From the moment I walked in, the staff made me feel genuinely welcomed. They were attentive and incredibly friendly throughout my visit.

Special mention to Shane and his crew, who went above and beyond to ensure my friends and I had a great experience overall.

Highly recommend Major 99 for anyone looking for quality service and a great atmosphere. Iâ€™ll definitely be back!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105397376631661385059/reviews
