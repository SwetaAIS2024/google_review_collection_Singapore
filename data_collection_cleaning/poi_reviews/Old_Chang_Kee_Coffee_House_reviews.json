It’s a pity that buns were out of stock when I was there. I also heard feedback from customers that the cheese curry puffs being seasonal for Christmas is also a demand for permanent menu. Air conditioned cafe environment makes it a good place for tea breaks. Please have more attractive meals price at different timing to attract more crowds and kindly make cheese curry puffs back too…. I need to try them .",

I bought 2 chicken sausage on stick, one spring roll and one sardin puff, expecting an additional free snack but he said it’s not applicable???? Then why have the poster up stating that? Just to get your customers to buy more then tell them the offer is not available? Simi sai",
