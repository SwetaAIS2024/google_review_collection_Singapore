C,5,"Happy Studio is a friendly neighborhood salon offering great hair and nail services at affordable prices. I had a $20 manicure and was impressed by the service and welcoming staff.

Alissa Lim,5,"Very happy with Yu Tong’s great service!
I have been to other salon, they have been trying to upswell me saying my hairs special treatment and their pricing is not transparent, there is a lot of upsize.
However, I do not feel any pressure with friend’z hair studio!

Dr N Howard,2,"The postcode lady was really good and I was a regular customer for four years. The new lady cuts hair unevenly. My hair is short and basic but she makes to mess it up. To make it worse, she charged me twice the previous rate. One extra star because at least she was nice, just didn't cut hair well. Now I need to find a new salon because I won't go back ☹️.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114013884571179817204/reviews
Schermann tan,1,"Super bad experience, Everyone please take note, and read other reviews, if you don’t want to waste your money.

If a business has good service, especially in hairdressing industry, all customers should be ensured satisfactory, however the staff there merely just trim the top and did not even cut short the back,untill I asked to amend a few times.  She got impatient and  she did not even ask if it was ok and just clean off, as there are other customer waiting. Shouldnt you cut the customer’s hair untill satisfied? Very bad experience, end results looked like did not even had any cut, paid $15 dollars for it",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112312250245442812731/reviews
