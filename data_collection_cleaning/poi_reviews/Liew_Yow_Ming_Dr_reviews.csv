Daniel B,5,"I went to Dr Liew YM twice.
One was when I had a fracture on my left elbow. And the second time was when I had an injury on my left knee (I couldn't walk properly due to the pain and swelling in my knee).
He helped to treat my injury with utmost care, and I recovered well and thankfully it is OK until now.
I would strongly recommend him to anyone who needs his expert help and treatment.
I had since referred a number of friends (including some from overseas) to Dr Liew, and all are satisfied with his professional approach to take care of the issues.
Thanks Dr Liew. Well done.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115809165710251949404/reviews
