Worst of the worst!\n\n(BTW, I didn't get to see a doctor until 2pm that day, their afternoon shift started already...so it was a solid 2.5hrs of waiting)",

(Pardon me if I misspelled the names)\n\nThe clinic was super busy as the next day is the start of long weekend. But, the staffs were so kind and gracious. My child was crying as he didn‚Äôt want me to leave him for 30 seconds for X-Ray. Arnell came to my rescue by patiently checking on me if I‚Äôm ready while clearing his queue and Shannon offered help to care for my son. It was a bit of a situation for me today and I expected people to be nasty to me as I brought a toddler with me to a medical check-up. I‚Äôm just so grateful for the kindness and understanding shown.\n\nSaw all the previous comments and I understand that the flow could be confusing but, with that amount of space and the crowd, the staffs were doing their best with their instructions üëçüèª",

Being realistic, that is already quite decent for a busy clinic, so I have no complaints! Just bring along a book or play your phone games to level up while waiting.\n\nChairs and music played in clinic made the wait comfortable. Free water dispenser available as well to quench thirst!\n\nStaff were welcoming, friendly and professional!",

      "text": "Worst clinic ever. Tried to make appointment through call but asked to just walk in. Walked in but can't have the checkup done as there are too many patients. Was asked to wait around 2-3 hours till the afternoon session where there are less patients. Have to come back another day to complete the xray test due to personal reasons. Then made to wait for another 1 hour as they conveniently forgot about me! They don't even give u a queue no. This clinic have terrible SOP and they really don't know how to handle incoming patients adminstrative matters properly. Don't ever visit if you have a choice.",

Waited over an hr on the phone to try to book an appointment.  1st 3 times (after 20 minutes each) the line went dead (almost as if someone picked up the phone and hung up right away...).  Finally got through after an hour of waiting.  To be told that the \"people who book reservations\" were not available and would call me back.  Where is the logic in that?  Moronic.  Let's see if they actually get back to me today.  I'm not optimistic.",
