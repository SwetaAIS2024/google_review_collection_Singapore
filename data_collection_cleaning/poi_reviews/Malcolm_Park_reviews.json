It is also next to Tanglin Community Club and CPIB Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre.\nThe park has an exercise corner on the hill slope. Rest benches are strategically located around the park.\nUnfortunately, there are no rain shelters, but otherwise a clean and pleasant green space.\nUp the slope or climbing up the stairs lead to some beautiful Colonial Houses.",
