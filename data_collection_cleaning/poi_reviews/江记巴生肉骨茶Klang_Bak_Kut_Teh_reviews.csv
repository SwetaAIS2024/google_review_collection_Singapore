Zach W,5,"Rating this a 5 purely for the quality of their food. Tried both types of Bak Kut Teh and their claypot pig trotters. Totally enjoyable, and an absolute find.

Just bear with the less than polite staff attitude. You won't regret it.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117398849978377272724/reviews
Cheri Teo,5,Have eaten here at least 10 times. Soup veryyy flavourful. Everything is served piping hot and bubbling away in the claypot. I have no issues with the serving size/ portion of the ingredients at all. Service is fair too. They take orders fast and serve you quick. Not sure why the service is inconsistent with the other reviews thoughâ€¦!,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103174928612547128350/reviews
