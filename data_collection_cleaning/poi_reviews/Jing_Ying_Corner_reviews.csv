Wayne Leong,4,"This coffee stand is conveniently located by the exit of Tanjong Pagar MRT (Tanjong Pagar Xchange). It is generally less crowded than some other coffee stands (like Local Coffee People), and the service is prompt.

The price point is fair, and the quantity is substantial. However, I find my order of kopi peng to be a tad lacklustre. The coffee flavour wasn’t strong, and in a few minutes, the dilution transformed it into coffee flavoured water. While I was mildly disappointed, I’ll be back to try the hot kopi for a better gauge of the coffee quality.

I appreciate that the staff uses a pair of tweezers to pick up straws to avoid contamination from multiple pairs of hands getting in contact.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116303283851842617447/reviews

I waited in the queue for 3 - 5 mins as they make the coffee cup by cup (the queue goes fast), I find this to be the best value for money coffee you can find around Tanjong Pagar MRT
