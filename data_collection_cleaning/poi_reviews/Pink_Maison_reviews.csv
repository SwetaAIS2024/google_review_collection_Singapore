Geraldine Yap,5,"Absolutely amazing experience at this cafÃ©! The waffles were perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, paired beautifully with their unique, flavorful ice creams. The Latte and Americano were smooth, fragrant, and well brewed.

Their freshly baked sponge cakes were incredibly soft and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The variety of flavorsâ€”Gula Melaka, Lime, Lemon, Green Tea, and Black Sesameâ€”made it hard to choose a favorite, but the Black Sesame and Lime won me over. My husband especially loved the Gula Melaka sponge cake, which had a rich burst of coconut milk flavor.

The cafÃ©â€™s ambience is warm and inviting, making it a perfect spot to relax, catch up with friends, or enjoy quality time with loved ones. Plus, the location is super convenientâ€”just a short walk from Mayflower MRT.

A big thank you to the lady boss for her warm hospitality and friendly service. Highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113553949165111199408/reviews
Jia Jun Ho,5,"Waffle is good, crispy and fluffy. Ice cream is creamy and not too sweet, we got the choco banana and oolong peach. Hojicha is nice too, will try next time.
They have 1 for 1 coffee for opening promotion. Coffee is not bad too.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102669351214625830710/reviews
Beanless Moomin,5,"The cafe Aircon is pretty nice and chill for a hot afternoon outside.
They have a pretty nice promo for a drink and a gelato now, though I do wish they had a larger selection of flavours.
If you're concerned about sustainability, they use reusable spoons to serve their ice creams.
The environment is really good to bring a date, or a group of friends ðŸ¤£",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104830145358242848046/reviews
