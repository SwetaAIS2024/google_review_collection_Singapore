Gillian Ng,5,"The Best kway chap in SG. Kway is soft but not soggy. Soup is awesome, mildly herbal, with lots of fried garlic bits and Chinese parsley. 2 of us had pork belly, intestine, pig skin, towkwa, egg and 2bowls of kway. All that for $7.
The kopi and teh from the kopi stall (facing the road) is also very good; as is the wonton mee stall 2 stalls down, run by a young man. Much better than the wonton mee in the middle aisle with the long queue.
FYI, less than half the stalls are open in the morning, so limited options.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111859550761883748316/reviews
Karen Huang,5,"Quaint hawker center that's perfect for insomniacs. The coffee and toast shop opens at 4.45am! And the service is always cheerful. There's also a well-known ""hidden gem"" kway chap stall. Don't let the $2.50 price tag fool you, the kway is silky soft.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118355045907908703251/reviews
Bossku,3,"A few decent stalls such as the coffee shop that sells baguette, a steak/burger stall that sells reasonably priced steaks.
