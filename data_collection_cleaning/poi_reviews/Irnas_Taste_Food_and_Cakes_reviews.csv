Azriel Noorazmie,5,"Tried their food at their recently opened outlet at Curbside Crafters in Kampong Glam. The ambience, location and service is 10/10 with vibey music cozy seats while waiting for them to prepare the food.

Their ayam geprek is to die for, the chicken is crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside and even after bringing home, the chicken stays crispy and not soggy. The size of the chicken is so worth it too! The chilli geprek has a kicker in it but tastes amazing regardless.

Tried their martabak manis and personally, I came back twice for their cheese and chocolate filling cause its so good!! I'm a definite returning customer to Irna's Taste!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106466276612182068433/reviews
