Tyrrou,1,"Maybank Tampines – Where Time Stands Still!

Visited Maybank Tampines for a basic banking service and was pleasantly surprised to experience what can only be described as a masterclass in waiting.

Over 3 hours (and counting), all for a simple request — truly setting new standards in redefining ‘efficiency’. If you're ever in need of a long, meditative pause in your day, Maybank has you covered.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118409117396207559833/reviews
william lim,3,"Cant put 0 star if can I would sure put 0 ZERO STAR!

Update -
Spoke to the manager of the bank Mr Julian.
He was polite and actually listen to what happen to us that we waited over an hour at Nex maybank. Than only to be informed that the bank need physical IC to start an account!
Mr Julian was able to help us.
Than was direct to Mr Aaron that attended to us to open up a bank account and all is settled",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106612317790977070961/reviews
Nazmi M,2,"One of the worse poor customer service.

Came at 1.40pm 7th November  and inform the service i required.

No heads up on how the waiting time gonna be.

After 2hr 10mins my number is being called up.

Customer service mention i dont have to wait and can fill up form earlier.

Thanks ah.

Her service is fast.

But the person in charge of queue number is doing a bad job. I mean you got 1 job only and fail terribly.

When you see your team handling swarm of customer the least you can do is help abd see which area you can help DIY with customer.

Ive a few appointments ahead and it affect my work as it overshot my schedule.

Anyway i wonder how customer that sign up savings, investment and insurance plan face this kind incompetent system. Imagine having to queue 2hrs everytime you have your financial review with your financial consultant if theres any.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116958838624211750117/reviews
