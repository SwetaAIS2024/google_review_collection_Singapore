Savan,5,"Having lived near Pasir Ris for several years, I never knew about this restaurant until a friend introduced it to us.

I really like the ambiance here‚Äîvery peaceful. Although the restaurant is next to a road and condominiums, it feels like a world of its own, free from noise.
The staff are also very polite and friendly.

The biggest surprise was that even without air conditioning, the place is pleasantly cool, making it comfortable even for someone like me who dislikes the heat.

Food: The food quality is decent overall and quite satisfying. We tried half a dozen oysters- not the most flavorful or creamy variety, but they were fresh. The steak preparation was also good, though it lacked a bit of beefy flavor.

Entrainment: The restaurant even has a dartboard for diners to enjoy. At just $2 per game, it was a fun activity for kids.

Although the prices are on the higher side, the unique environment makes it a nice option for festive celebrations or special occasions.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115757903290306503916/reviews

Jason Lim,5,"Near our new home. Chill and secluded cafe with very decent food. We ordered 6 oysters and the promotion set - 1 pork knuckles with 2 pints of beers. Very full already shared by 2 adults. The pork knuckles was very crispy indeed much to exceeding my expectation. Friendly and helpful servers. Clean tables and environment. Big TV screens for soccer lovers. Have darts and fish tank to view. If you sit near entrance, you get to enjoy the wonderful lightings by the tree. If you bring your dogs or pets, I think it's perfect environment. Heard chicken wings is signature for side dish next time will try definitely.

Cheers happy sat and weekend to all.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105077761621672750125/reviews
