Thick generous egg soup. no meat inside, but the handmade dough is worth the try.\n\n10 dumplings for $7. Acceptable also.\n\nBut minus one star for using disposable cutleries even for dine-in.\n\nRecommended for people who dont mind :)",

The eggy soup broth is very smooth and comforting but the bits of hae bee(dried shrimp) at the bottom of the bowl is quite irritating.\n\nThe pan fried dumplings were disappointing. It tasted like they were baked instead of fried - so hard and dry.",
