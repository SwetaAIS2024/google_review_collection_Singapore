      "text": "I went to the Kovan DBS branch to inquire about closing my account, and they told me that I couldn’t do it there and had to go to the Kaki Bukit branch instead. However, when I arrived at Kaki Bukit, they told me the same thing—that account closure wasn’t possible there either.\n\nSo does DBS only allow account openings but not closures? What kind of logic is that? Where exactly am I supposed to go to close my account? It honestly feels like every branch is just trying to push responsibility elsewhere.\n\nOn top of that, the service attitude was absolutely terrible. The staff showed no willingness to assist, and when I stood in front of them trying to ask questions, they completely ignored me and continued chatting among themselves. This is by far one of the worst banking experiences I’ve ever had.",
