WDG Dingguo,5,"A hidden gem of a stall selling amazing 18 varieties. Not only do they serve great tasting ke kou kian, fishball noodles, bar chor mee, they also serve laksa, ban mian and porridge. My favorite is their ke kou mian! A sinful meal that comes piping hot with tons of ingredients, including prawn, pork slice, pork liver, egg. Not forgetting the well cooked noodles, not too hard not too soft just the way I like it. The soup always warms my heart. Never disappoints. A great way to start the day or end the night.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118149297852514861223/reviews
chiyu liu,5,I always come here for late night supper and love the ke kou mian! I would say its the best ke kou mian I have had. Full of ingredients and springy noodles. In fact everything on their menu is good. They have all kinds of noodles from bah chor mee to ban mian to lor mee to porridge and laksa. All in one stall! Love it!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115802961489841218549/reviews
