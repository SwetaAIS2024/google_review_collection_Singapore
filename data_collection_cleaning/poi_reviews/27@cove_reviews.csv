Franny GOH,4,"I like the atmosphere. The live band is one of the added point. Lamb curry pizza is quite special and tasty. Foods all are nice. The only thing to be improve is variety of beer like Guinness Stout. Customer service is good, they can help to order kid’s meal from next bar. Definitely will go again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101886423905785711366/reviews

Dannica Conje,5,"Had dinner at 27@Cove and really enjoyed most of their food. My personal fav is their Baked Mac&Cheese, Fried Chicken and Iced Passion Fruit Tea.

You’ll definitely enjoy if you want a place to chill since they also have billiards. Restaurant is under new ownership, he’s very nice and attentive to customer’s needs. Highly recommended bar and restaurant!😊",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102092919863175130036/reviews
