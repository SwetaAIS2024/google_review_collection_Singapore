Nur Yantie,1,"was at the Rehabilitation Centre Reception A this afternoon at 3:20pm 8/4/25. the lady at counter 1 shouted across the room over the kiosk at the corner, towards us. Instead of shouting at us, can't she approach and tell us?? Her butt stick to the chair issit? Very inconsiderate and rude! Pls do something about the staff here, thank you.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110606690717260181780/reviews
Say Mrsle,2,"I'm disappointed with the level of professionalism I recently experienced in the A&E department.  The communication from the team was minimal and unclear.  I also found some staff members to be rather unfriendly, which added to the stress of the situation.  I hope the hospital addresses these issues to improve patient experience.  A more compassionate and communicative approach would greatly benefit everyone.üôèüòî",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113207044042310437486/reviews

May,5,"I was asked to go to A&E by my GP, and there they found a tear in my eye. Dr. Ding Jianbin performed the laser treatment on my retina. Despite his extremely busy schedule, he still managed to do an excellent job. I was lucky the tear was found early, otherwise, it could have worsened into a retinal detachment. A big thank you to Dr. Ding Jianbin and the nurse who stayed back to assist.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100586119117093145024/reviews
Miss Rabbit,1,"Doctors suck in general, they cancelled my surgery last minute because they ""thought"" they found another reason why i fell sick about 2 hours before my surgery and ""didnt have time to tell me"" and when i recovered WITHOUT taking the surgery they told me i could be discharged. On the day of my discharge,right after they took out the iv plug, the doctors suddenly came in and was like ""hey, you have bacteria in your blood so like we can let you go yet"" i was pissed off so badly because they took my blood almost everyday and only said it on the day i was going to be discharged. They didnt even know waht type of bacteria it was and couldn't answer any of our questions they just kept saying ""oh there's bacteria in your blood"" and ""we need to take more blood and reinsert the iv plug"" like ok i heard you for the first time?? In the end when i was discharged, the doctors told me that actually my blood was contaminated so i didn't actually have bacteria in my blood. Honestly the worst doctors i have met. They even had a poster about being the best hospital in 2025üôÑüôÑ best hospital my ass. My advice is to go somewhere else dont ever come here no matter how far the other hospitals are",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105106216063309480047/reviews
