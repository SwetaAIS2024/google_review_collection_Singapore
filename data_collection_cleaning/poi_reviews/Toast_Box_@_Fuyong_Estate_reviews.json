The old pictures on the wall tell the history of this place and the railway that connected Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia. I ordered their nasi lemak and coffee with milk. The nasi lemak was flavourful. The rice, chicken wing, egg, cucumbers, peanuts with ikan bilis, and sambal paste were beautifully arranged on top of a banana leaf. The coffee was excellent. Itâ€™s prepared at the right temperature and with balance amount of milk. Although the total price was a bit high, the overall experience paid off ðŸ¥°",

I love the consistency of the soft boiled eggs. Itâ€™s a good place for catch up after our morning exercise. And Cold Storage is just a few steps away to pick up some groceries\n\nThe place is clean despite the high traffic",

Coffee turns out to be one of the best local kopi we had, kudos to the lad making the drinks.\n\nYam toast was great, I love how the butter melts in the mouth instead of being a cold slab of butter. I would ask for less butter so that I could get more taste of yam. Was looking forward to the black sesame toast however it was a tad disappointing cos the spread was thin and the butter overpowered in taste.",

The cafe has a great ambience with a beautiful & calm interior. Very fast and efficient service. The food tastes great too. It is an ideal cafe for hot drinks and a long chat.",
