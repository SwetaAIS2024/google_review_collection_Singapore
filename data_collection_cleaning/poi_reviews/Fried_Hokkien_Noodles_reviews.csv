Leong GS,3,"The hokkien mee was good, taste great! But ingredients was not much, I ordered $6. And even thought seem queues long. It's quite confused as no order number while you are waiting for your order. This can be improve. So that the aunty wouldn't be so stressed.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103413305834535771450/reviews
Bryan,2,"The queue is a mess, uncle forget about other people order..

Taste is so-so, very salty. After eating with kids, we felt very thirsty.. wondering how much sodium is in there.

Jz L,2,"Tried the Taobao previously, didn’t leave much of an impression. So tried again at the stall.
Both times ordered $5

It’s neither dry nor wet, more like gluey kind of consistency. Broth not so fragrance, lack egg fragrance as well. 2 prawns was ok, sotong almost invisible but white sio bak is nice. Chili is ok too.
Pork lard is given on demand only. And uncle seems very unwilling

Wasn’t impressed with their queue system.
If u need to take more orders. Just walk down the line and take a couple more orders. Splitting 2 lines makes new customers confused. Some went queueing at the ordered line.

But I guess it will be my last visit unless I need a quick HKM fix within walking distance
I could travel a little further for Blk155 Yong Heng or 777 or neighbourwok.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111322747117774848218/reviews
Cynthia Khor,3,"Taste is normal, dug through the whole packet but there is only one prawn for a $5 portion.

2 out of 5 without chilli
