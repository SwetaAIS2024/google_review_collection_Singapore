Esther koh,5,"My daughter has been attending this school for almost two years, and we really love the close-knit relationship among the teachers and students.

She is very shy and introverted, but the toddler teachers are especially patient and always send us updates to reassure us that she is doing well.

In addition, we receive a weekly newsletter that lets us know what she has learned and done during the week.

We also love that the school has a playground and that the students get to enjoy outdoor time twice a day!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106506750155860594992/reviews
