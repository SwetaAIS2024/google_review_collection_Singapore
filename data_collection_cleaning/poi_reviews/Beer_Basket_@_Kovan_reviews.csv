Maxy,5,"Visited twice as I live nearby. Pasta and pizza were great, and there‚Äôs lots of different alcohol to choose from. Best part is there‚Äôs Guinness draft too!! Best time is to enjoy all day happy hour on Sunday. Outdoor seatings available to watch people and traffic while enjoying a good pint.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116929885102483880042/reviews
vera sim,5,"Ordered creamy sambal pasta and pepperoni pizza using Burpple 1-1 deal. The pasta was amazing! Could already smell the sambal when it was served. Very spicy and delicious, and there was a lot of bacon as well. 10/10 would get again. Pepperoni pizza was also great! Very cheesy and fragrant.

Overall I really enjoyed the food and ambience. Loved that everything was served piping hot (from my experience this is not a given in many places lol) Can‚Äôt wait to try the other dishes on my next visit :)

Update:
Came back again and tried their fiery crab & shrimp aglio olio. Spicy kick with a slight charred taste, overall great! Fries came piping hot and with a generous portion. Will definitely return for more!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110119207574418735371/reviews

Samson Ong,5,"Has always been in my list to visit - and it didn't disappoint.

Good range of bottled/canned beer for you to go through. They also serve typical drafts that you get in Singapore. Not so sure about price, that is.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115047472793377726722/reviews
Hament Rai,3,"Popped into this joint coz I recently purchased an apartment in the neighbourhood and I liked at the first impression.

It just opened, had 4 people inside including me. I requested a window table but I was told it was reserved but I was willing to move later and booking was for much later (if any at all). I felt that the staff overly cautious and I felt it was unreasonable to accommodate my request.

3 hours later I left and the no one came to the table and when asked about the table vacancy, I was eluded that the booking was pushed to later.

Overall a great experience but somehow I felt cheated and unfairly denied a very simple and small request üôÅ

Thus I am at best give the rating assessment as such, sadly I might add. This could have been a regular haunt for me as it‚Äôs walking distance from my apartment!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117329699783907018829/reviews
