KC Cheang,4,"Delicious and reasonably priced Korean cuisine. The jogbal was quite good with a mix of interesting sauce and condiments. I think it's worthwhile trying it out with a set dish. The $77 jogbal set can serve 3-4 people. Access is easy just off the AYE, with ample car parking in the basement.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117568484182798958598/reviews
Tracy Zhang,4,"This Korean restaurant is a special one in the neighborhood.
The set is really good and enough for 2-3pax . You can choose 2 flavors and we had garlic and spicy.
The spicy one was sweet and spicy but after a while you can feel the hot! It‚Äôs good to have this flavor and it can reduce the fatness.
The garlic flavor is also good and nice with all the sauce!
There is a stew of beef and spicy noodles which are both really nice!
We were really satisfied with the meal and definitely enjoyed it!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115734578140137125670/reviews
Nancy Tan,5,"Authentic & Rare Korean Restaurant
We had bibimbap with raw beef and it came with a huge bowl of quality vegetables & raw beef that is good for 2 pax. Next we had spicy seafood tofu soup which is equally flavorful.
Food is definitely value for money considering the freshness, portion & superb taste. Not forgetting the appetizing side dishes. Do not underestimate the spiciness which we loved.
Will come back for more! üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108202434160135288795/reviews

Jonathan Ha,5,"Walked here for lunch (it was 12.5km!), and the hunger probably helped, but it was amazing! The jokbal was tender, flavorful, and absolutely delicious, paired perfectly with the generous and tasty side dishes. A must-visit spot for authentic Korean food that leaves you satisfied! ü§§
Will definitely come back if I'm around the area.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105083343639912953526/reviews
