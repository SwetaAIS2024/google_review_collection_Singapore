The steak was extremely dry and hard, the fish was tasteless and we cannot find any smoked duck as see in the photo. Service was extremely bad and rude. They took a long time to give me my change as the head staff said they donâ€™t have any more $10 notes. He was constantly shouting at the hired staff. If there was a minus one rating, I would have given it.",
