Charles S,1,"Beware, the customer service does not exist, my company had asked for an invoice for rent due for 2 months as I was overseas and was never given an answer or invoice.  They terminated us with no notice or warning, not even a single email.  They turned around and said you can continue if you rent this larger office space, the smaller ones all taken.  What a joke!  This was one of the worst office rental experiences of my life.  AVOID this company, these people are scam artists, do not make the mistake that I did.  Yes the rates seem reasonable, but you end up actually paying more in the end.  Avoid this place at all costs believe me It will cost you much more in the future",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103779882060258687217/reviews
