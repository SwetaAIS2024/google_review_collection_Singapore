      "text": "Exquisite dining experience - possibly the best I’ve had.\n\nWith the price to boot, however saying that, nothing was not thought of.\n\nThe food was creative, tasty and full of flavour and incredibly beautiful.\n\nThe service was friendly, polite, not pretentious at all - very welcoming. It didn’t feel like you needed to be dripping in wealth like a lot fine dining establishments - it was down to earth friendly and authentic- yet second to none. Litterally 1:1 service ratio. The team explained each dish beautifully.\n\nHighly recommend for a special occasion for small groups (2-4).",

One thing to highlight: they forgot to serve my sourdough (on the second attempt), we found it funny as  the person who initially to offer us this but he forgot. They served the new spreads but then forgot the sourdough.",

Melts in the mouth, yet not too greasy like others.  Can totally finish all without feeling sick of it.\n\nA cosy place with 10 tables only (I believe). Great view of one of Singapore's most beautiful skylines.\n\nI'm definitely going back to try out the different menus and for the night view.",

The wide glass window overlooking the iconic Marina Bay and Singapore skyscrapers was stunning.\nTo us, it was a night to remember and celebrate.",
