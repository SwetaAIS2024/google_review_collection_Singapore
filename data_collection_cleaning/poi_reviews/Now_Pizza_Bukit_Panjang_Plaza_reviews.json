Affordable ,worth it and it's fast too.\nJust ordered mine and got my pizza ready  in 10 minutes.\nLoves their 2 pizza combo. Their garlic bread super soft and we cant get enough of it.

      "text": "Canâ€™t rate on services and atmosphere as they only do takeaway. Very good balance of quality and price of pizza. I tried chicken pepperoni, truffle mushroom, margherita & garden shrooms.\n\nChicken pepperoni - very well flavoured, perfect mix of tomato base and cheese. Tasty meat.\n\nTruffle mushroom - Very good flavour of truffle, but wish the truffle flavour can be stronger and spread across the pizza. The one that I ate, the truffle is only on certain parts of the pizza. So some slices can be quite bland.\n\nMargherita - Well balance of cheese, eating this feels very light.\n\nGarden shrooms - I personally donâ€™t eat bell peppers so didnâ€™t enjoy this as much, hence canâ€™t say much about this pizza\n\nI am a big eater hence I can eat 2 of these pizza in a go. But for a normal person, 1 pizza is more than enough to satisfy one meal\n\nNote to Now Pizza - Could include thin crust pizza as an option for consumers with different taste. Keep it up, I feel this is better than other major competitors!",

I ordered the margarita and hot bee pepperoni and both were so delicious especially the pepperoni one because of the hot honey ðŸ¤¤ writing this review makes me want to go back again to try the other flavours ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹",
