Sharifa Ib,5,Sent my son for creative art lessons when he was about three.. and when I had my daughter.. we did the same thing.. both my children enjoyed the beautiful and structured lessons created by Abrakadoodle. They have really good teachers who can give good support and there to communicate at their kids level. The love for creative art is instilled strongly in my children and itâ€™s like part and parcel of their growing journey. Kudos to the Abrakadoodle Team!,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111350071220676298879/reviews
Marianne Teoh,5,"My son looks forward to his lessons each week and has become more confident in using his drawings to tell a story and even express his feelings. The teachers are also patient, fun and creative! Lessons are well-planned and together with our child we have learnt so much about the different art mediums available, artists as well as art styles. Definitely a place for young budding artists!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105650968032831734966/reviews
Aloor Rittu Pius,5,"My two girls have thoroughly enjoyed their art classes at Abrakadoodle. The lessons are well designed and creative, fun and engaging. Definitely one of the most value added enrichment programs available in Singapore. A special word of thanks to teacher Jo who is so thoughtful and caring. She touches base with parents and gives us regular and timely updates about each arts class our kids attend. I will definitely be patronising them for a long time to come.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105200170770161566426/reviews
Qinghai Wang,4,Good curriculum planned for the kids to expose them different types of artists and learn different techniques and styles of art. Class size is about right. There is also a presentation at the end of the class for the kids to explain what they have learnt and showcase their drawing. Teacher Jo diligently sends the video and summary of learning every week. My kid had fun in learning art with Abrakadoodle. Highly recommended if you stay at the west.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111269898835902676875/reviews
Ratih Oktarini,4,"Fun and interesting classes. The owner is friendly and nice. My child loved the classes. They are more of the exposure type. Every week, students are exposed to different kind of art style and material: canvas, clay, paper cutting, etc. Some may see that this kind of approach don't actually build the students' specific art skill. Since there was no skill buil up from one class to another.  But I think its enough for small children. Too bad that my child did not want to continue.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116981666972872043931/reviews
