Amritaa Shankar (pooja s shroff),5,"This is a fun watch.

JJ,5,"It’s crazy how good the transit facilities in Changi Airport Terminal 3 is. There is a free cinema with free showings 24/7. The cinema is pretty well done too, with proper seats, fully dark room and a strong sound system.

Jesse Lee,4,"This free 24/7 movie theater is on the second floor, there’s a daily movie schedule by the entrance. They offer kids as well as all kinds of movies. I like that they keep the sound low so people can sleep in the quiet, dark room on a comfortable seats.
