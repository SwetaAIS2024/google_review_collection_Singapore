      "text": "Excellent roast duck. Juicy flesh, crispy skin. Roast pork is very good too. Char siew is a little too sweet for me but definitely well caramelised. My 3 treasures rice with extra meat cost $8, but is quite worth it considering the generous meat portions. The soup on the side is sichuan vegetable soup. It's free and quite yummy though you can certainly taste the MSG.\n\nConclusion: Love the duck! Will be back!",
