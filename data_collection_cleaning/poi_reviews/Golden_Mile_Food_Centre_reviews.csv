Xoom Too,5,"A really nice food court/hawker center which isn’t exactly very near a lot of stuff yet is very easy to get to by public bus. My favorite hawker is the ‘braise 卤之家**’** which doesn’t have a ton of options but the few options are very delicious and ingredients go well together.

A ton of workers come here at lunchtime as well so if you don’t want to have trouble with lines and seatings, I’d recommend you coming earlier or later than 11-1pm. There’s a variety of hawkers such as noodles, rice, soups, fish, meats, desserts, and more. Prices all around are quite decent and you can get a small, big, or in some hawkers medium sized version of a dish.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105863133358477079886/reviews
Ming Shen Tham,3,"Used to visit this place relatively frequent in the past. I used to like the fried hokkien mee alot since it was one of the few stalls where the noodles are relatively dry and soaked up with the prawn broth. However over the years, the standard of this fried hokkien mee has dropped drastically. Nowadays it does not taste as good and of course it is more expensive. The chicken rice which also used to taste great is now full of msg taste and you get really thirsty after having it",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116082735539712168059/reviews
L. Online,5,"A lot of nice food here, suitable for all ages and category. Most important thing is the cleaniness and no bird shit. Thanks to the uncle and auntie cleaner who did a good job, clear and clean very fast. Ive tried the Taiwan food and it taste good. The queue is long but they served very fast. And I've tried 1+Kopi as Im curious why so very long queue.. I can see the stall is clean and both operator/owner put on mask.. Which is very good snd hygenic! After tried the coffee and Yuan Yanh, now I know why long queue 😋",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116620772267484554878/reviews

Eric Yap (happyten),5,"I was too full to have a meal, and my bus to KL was in 30 minutes or so, so just found an old lady who might be in her 70s and still working hard, so I bought a bowl of cendol from her.

When I searched for the shop’s name, found quite a few numbers of branches. So I asked the old lady, who I thought she was the owner of the shop, but she said she just happened saw that the shop was hiring, so she applied for the job. I sensed that the brand of Old Amoy Cendol was quite a marketing strategic name. Found out that the owner is in his 30s. Can be my son, she said.

I could go and searched about the business but I didn’t. She was the one that attracted me to buy from her, though the brand name did earn her credit.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114564556606871365313/reviews
