      "text": "Visited this cafe during the weekday lunch peak.  The restaurant was extremely busy, and there were only two service crew on duty.  Thankfully, the self-ordering system made placing my order a breeze, and the food arrived quickly.\n\nI opted for the most expensive set lunch, Nasi Lemak with fried Turmeric Chicken Leg with a side salad and hot coffee. The total cost came to $22.66, inclusive of tax and service charge.  Unfortunately, the food was mediocre, and the chicken leg was quite dry.  The portion size was also rather small for the price. The coffee was passable though.\n\nHowever, I must commend the 2 service crew, who managed everything so efficiently despite the rush. I might return only if I need a quick lunch in the area.",

Would prefer the toast without the crust but well…that’s personal preference. Washed that all down with hot soya milk. Wife ate the spicy prawn noodle and no complaints from her.",
