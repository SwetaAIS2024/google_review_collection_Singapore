Dickie,5,"Takeaway only and just started operations. Solid kebab but it‚Äôs fast and good for a quick bite when you‚Äôre not feeling Indian or Chinese. The bread looks thick and dense but it was quite fluffy!

Convenience level bumps it up to a 5 for me but not something I‚Äôd travel or queue for. Best of luck to the new proprietor!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101933871268763325560/reviews
Nadya Lim,5,"A random location but kebab is good! Generous amount of chicken, the sauce compliments the bread and meat well. I personally feel price point is fair. Staff serving me was really friendly! Overall a pleasant experience. They only do take aways.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101664187546764109414/reviews

Jean Y,5,"Halal German style d√∂ner kebab - which is a flatbread stuffed with kebab and veggies, and a choice of sauce. Flatbread was EXCELLENT - fluffy with a tinge of sourdough taste. Tasty meats and fresh veggies - can‚Äôt ask for more. Also üíØfor the mini alfresco vibe. If you‚Äôre looking for a wrap, go for the Durum. There‚Äôs a gelato shop next door opening in April 2025 if you need a pick me up after a hearty kebab. Highly recommend the dark cacao and pistachio flavours. The mulberry sorbet was also refreshing.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113654267077268083082/reviews
Nat L K,5,"Bismillahi Masya Allah.. good things must share especially when it‚Äôs halal. Had the Chicken Doner Kebab and it‚Äôs delightfully delicious. The bread is uniquely soft yet ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù sourdough-like with  the filing so generous. The sauce is yummy with a tinge of all tastes, super flavourful. A must try especially if you are a fan of kebabs! If you are not, you will convert to one (like my daughter)! I‚Äôm not a fries fan but we love the fat yet crunchy fries too. And it just beside Masjid Kassim so after terawih, i ate 1 and im so glad to buy back too. It remained yummy for sahur too. I‚Äôm gonna get again next weekü§≠",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106846548138110959830/reviews
