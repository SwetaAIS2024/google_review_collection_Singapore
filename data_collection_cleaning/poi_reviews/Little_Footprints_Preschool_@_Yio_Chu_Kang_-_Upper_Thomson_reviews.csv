Meena,5,"It has been a wonderful experience at Little Footprints Tung Po (YCK)- with not one but 3 of our kids attending the school. The teachers have been amazing, attentive and always looking out for the little ones. We have often been pleasantly surprised with the curriculum and the level of education standard at the school. A special shout put to Ms Kate, Lao Shis, Ms Corrine, Ms Praise and Ms Jerrica for all their love and attention.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102661639413361963434/reviews
