      "text": "When the store changed hands to the duo of ladies, the prices were unjustifiably jacked up so much, and the payment methods were reduced to cash only. Within less than 3 months, the store was ran to the ground, and now it has been closed since the end of February till now with no notices of how long it will be closed for or a permanent closure. The UEN is still listed as valid and online but on the official registry it does not exist. Now old rusty fridges with moldy drinks are just left there, together with shelves and stagnant water.",

      "text": "As mentioned by others, the shop lady has a bad attitude. Came here to collect parcel bought frm shopee. The lady seems uninterested to entertain those coming to collect parcel. Parcels were also not very organised. They were scattered on floor, shelves etc so she took a long time to look for the parcel. Initially I wanted to buy some snacks frm her shop but bcos she took a looong time to look for parcel and I was running late, I decided to return snack items to the shelf and go off. One of the snacks fell as I was returning it and she said I was rude and throwing her things around. Never coming back here again.",

      "text": "Trying out Shopee collection point here and it is worst decision ever. Went to collect at 11.30am on wed and it is not opened. Called them and they say they will open tomorrow from 9am. Went there the next day at 9.30am and it is again not opened. Call them and the same person answered scolding me saying hello the shopee website saying it is opened at 10.30 why you come at 9.30, you understand or not.\n\nTotally horrible. I rather pay 2$ for shipping to home rather than dealing with the kind of emotional damage and uncertainty it caused.\n\nContacted Shopee live agent which was not very helpful and giving wrong phone number for me to call. They asked me to raise refund request instead which imo not fair for sellers & buyers for something that is caused by collection pointsâ€¦",
