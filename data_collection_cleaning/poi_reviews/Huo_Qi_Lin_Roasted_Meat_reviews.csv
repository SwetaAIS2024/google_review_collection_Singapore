Donald Isaac,5,"Chanced upon this new stall that just opened at The coffeeshop below the Elitist.

The the roast meats is flavorful. More to Malaysian style roast meat and noodles. The char siew very good and also the roast pork. The duck didnâ€™t have a strong game smell.

Wanton noodles are cooked with black sauce nicely.

Will definitely go back as the prices are really reasonable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111620843433357170307/reviews
