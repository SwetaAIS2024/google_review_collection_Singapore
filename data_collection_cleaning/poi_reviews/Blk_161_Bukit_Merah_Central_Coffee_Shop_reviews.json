Although I am a heavy spicy eater, the taste doesn't feel right. Overall, if to queue for it, maybe I will give it a pass but if not much people, I will definitely eat it again.",

The lady handling the counter was so blur and she had no idea what was happening. She did not know how to use the POS machine. and the guy who was making the drink was very interested in his own phone. Just buying drinks with 2 person in front of me took about 10 minutes. The queue only moved when another guy in black stepped in and tools over making the drinks. Would recommend bringing your own water bottle here.",
