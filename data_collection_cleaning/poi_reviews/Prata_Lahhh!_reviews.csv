Vin W,5,"The newly opened shop at the Community Centre serves fantastic prata! The place neat and air-conditioned, with a great menu. Enjoyed the Bull's Eye Prata and Plain Prata, both fresh and fluffy, and the milk tea was great too.
One suggestion: dry plates before serving would enhance the experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109263427873687540100/reviews
Pearline Cher,5,The food portion is big. Prata is crispy and not so oily. We had the fish curry and it taste fresh and delicious. It mixed very well with the prata. Only suggest is for the Nasi Goreng with Chicken Tikka best is separate instead of mixed in together. But overall food experience is really good.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103976577056980417001/reviews
Ewan Lim,5,"Second time here at the Tengah outlet and still impressed. Ordered prata and briyani. Prata was crispy. The mutton briyani was excellent, fragrant, flavorful, and the rice had a great texture, not too wet or dry. The mutton was tender and not gamy at all. What stood out was the service. The staff noticed we were sharing and thoughtfully brought over a few extra pieces of mutton for us. Very attentive and generous. Will definitely be back.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111824544630396822247/reviews
Derek Hum,4,"Service is quite slow. There was only one server. Curry is not self service, so gotta take what they give. Could try asking for more.

Komalasree Ramanathan,1,"Ordered Mysore mutton Satti sorru, however received overcooked (like a thairu satham / porridge), $15 gone into drain, not worth. Even Tea was terrible. Very bad, do not go there even for Prata as its so oily. feel bad for all those diners having food in there. very dirty restaurant as well.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103537326393717970562/reviews
