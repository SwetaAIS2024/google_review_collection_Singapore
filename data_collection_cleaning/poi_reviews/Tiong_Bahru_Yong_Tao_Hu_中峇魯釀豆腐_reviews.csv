Yap Hoe BENG,3,"April25, 27, my friend Cheong suggest we try out this TB YTHu, I was a bit hesitate but go along. I order the soup big @ 7.90. Looking at it, quite plain. But it was good hot, Mee Hoon just nice and the chilli is ok. A good place to have lunch - a bit of good vibes. Price on the high side. We recommend to try if you are around this area for 1st timer otherwise there r much better YTF at better prices at the hawker centre.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116220693681278781294/reviews
