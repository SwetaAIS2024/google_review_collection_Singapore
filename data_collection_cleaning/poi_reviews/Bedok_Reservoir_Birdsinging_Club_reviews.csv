Forest BK,5,"🐦🦅🕊️🐦‍🔥🐦‍⬛🦜The Bird Singing Area at Bedok Reservoir Park is a delicated area where bird hobbyist gather to showcase their songbirds.
🦜Judging from the sheer number of cage hanging poles, it must have been a lively chorus of birdsongs echoing the entire area when the hobbyist are all gathered here.
🦅Bird keeping has been a traditional hobby since the 19 century, or earlier, going by historical records.
🐦‍⬛But this traditional hobby is losing popularity in this fast-pace city life and where people are living in close proximity like in HDB flats that individual space and noise level are fiercely guarded.
🦅Noisy bird calls while still in bed is the last thing you want.
🦜Paradoxically, It would be a great loss, should this traditional pastime be gone.
🐧So far, the other park where a space is delicated to Bird Singing is at Ang Mo Kio Town Garden West.
🐦‍🔥Fun fact:
In 2018, songbird rearing was designated as Intangible Cultural Heritage by Singapore's Natiinal Heritage Board. 🐦",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Ayden,4,"The birdsinging area is a tranquil and peaceful spot to chill. You can see uncles relaxing there and having their conversations. When you walk by, you can identify this spot by the distinct chirping noises of the birds and the characteristic candy cane like structures. This spot is also near Burp Kitchen, so you can come hear after a meal there.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106135019536209720427/reviews
