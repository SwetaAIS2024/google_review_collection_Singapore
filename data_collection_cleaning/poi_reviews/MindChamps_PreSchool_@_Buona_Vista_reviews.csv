Nurul Ahmad,5,Both my children have been in this centre since infant care. My first one has graduated from the centre and the second one will be soon. The main reason why I stayed at the centre was because the teachers at the centre are caring and accommodating. They felt like family and I never felt worried as I knew they were in good hands ❤️ we will miss dropping our kids off here next year!,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116703301524012281415/reviews
