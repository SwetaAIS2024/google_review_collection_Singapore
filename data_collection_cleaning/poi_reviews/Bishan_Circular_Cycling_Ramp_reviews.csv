KK,3,"Finally this circular cycling ramp is open after about 3 years of construction.  This ramp is generally well built with good lighting and the curvature is not too sharp. The gradient is quite gentle for ease of cycling up slope.  The traction of the ground is good and it is still quite safe to cycle when it is wet.  But that also mean if you fall while cycling, you may suffer a deep cut.  There are also some pitfalls too for it to earn only 3 stars.

The cycling lanes are quite narrow. There is a danger that one’s bicycle handle may collide with another if the cyclists follow strictly the paths given, and both are riding in opposite directions.  This is especially true near the curved part.  Also, novice cyclists pls remember to slow down when cycling downslope, especially near the curvature part.  Fortunately, they have removed the “slow down” gates and put them further down.  If not, there is a danger that some cyclists may knock onto the gates when travelling down slope at great speed.

This is probably Singapore’s first circular cycling ramp.  Pls enjoy it safely.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113784640123612530331/reviews
Timothy Teo,4,Nice to include on your cycling or running path. The Toa Payoh side you need to come down and push the bike up/down as the path is too narrow.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109273027791328273356/reviews

Ming,4,Nicely built cycling ramp and serves it purpose. But authority may want to put up signs for bicycles to slow down especially after seeing some riders xycling down the ramp in high speed amd endangering other users.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109226628464118431877/reviews
