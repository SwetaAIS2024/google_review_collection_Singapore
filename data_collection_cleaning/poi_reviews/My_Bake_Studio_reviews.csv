Carmen Lee,4,"Ordered a birthday cake for my boy's birthday, with OnePiece theme, chocolate flavour.
The cake design was very pretty.

However, they used black colouring. After ate, leave a black stain on lips. The stain still there even after washed or wiped with wet tissue. Kids were so freak out.
Hope you will take note on the colouring being used.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109878968685169408536/reviews

Jewel,1,"Ordered the vanilla and strawberry cake for a birthday party. Design was beautiful but the taste was very disappointing. Didnt taste like a vanilla cake at all, more like a banana cake. Moreover, it was pretty bland and not sweet. Delivery was late and no one bothered to inform us till I messaged the number. Disappointing experience and the cake was $180.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111235936947047928724/reviews
