Tan Bee Lan,3,"When I move to Pasir Ris in 1993, this cC was not even appeared!
I only first visit was I enrolled a karaoke singing lesson. After that I came for my favorite breakfast- Mcdonald.
Milo re often is to get my cash from the POSB ATM located on the ground floor of the CC
It was renovated new years back and I had to move away so I hardly come back that oftenâ€¦.
That also because of Covid-19 I did not visit this place with any purpose.
That morning I was looking for the howker noodle stall for breakfast so I came back here n decided to take a few pictures of this CC!

In front of the CC building has a huge void ground that is used to hold our major festivals, that make our residents get together and celebrate in harmony!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116576705131180623301/reviews

Sten (Piqued Wanderer),5,"With many big spaces to conduct several events in one place, this CC packs a punch. For the SG nite race in 2019, they are even screening it live on at their lobby.

Great place to check out their events calender. There are sure interesting events happening every now and then. So go on down and check out ur neighborhood community club..

Its worth it.

Cheers!!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115011929186540431052/reviews
