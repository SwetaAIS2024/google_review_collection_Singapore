Would recommend for team bonding activities or if you would like to try your hand at creating a striking decorative piece. The class is easy to follow and isn‚Äôt too daunting for beginners too.",

It offers a variety of batik workshops for both small & large groups. They also have interesting pre-waxed batik painting kits that make great gifts tooüéÅ, but do call to check the availability of various patterns.",

I like how the materials and we'll designed for a beginner and have options to buy take home packs too.  I would definitely be back to practice the skill. Glad to have found this new hobby! Thank you Mr Kamal for having your studio and sharing your love of Batik with us. Highly recommend for everyone!",
