They closed all self-checkout kiosks and only had one cashier open. This was unacceptable, inconvenient, and a very bad way of managing the store. I urge the top management to please address this issue with the store's floor management.",

Fairprice Killiney Road must be lucky have you! There are 5 supermarkets within walking distance, Iâ€™ve always choose to buy from this outlet. Their newly reno is sparkling clean, cozy and spoil for choice. Look forward to my next visit!",

On multiple visits, I encountered pricing errors, and instead of helping, she reacted with impatience and aggressively yelled to us. This level of poor attitude is hilarious and far below the service standards of other FairPrice locations.",
