      "text": "This stall gives Thai food a bad name. The Thai basil meat was neither tasty nor spicy. The omelette egg does not have any Thai taste at all.\n\nThe tom yum soup tasted more like ginger soup, the two prawns inside were mushy, the soup was not spicy and it came with crab stick and fish balls.\n\nThe pad Thai was terrible. Tasteless and also came with crab stick.\n\nIt is unfortunate, but please avoid ordering delivery from here as there is a high chance of disappointment. It was so bad, my wife and I had to eat ice cream to lift our moods. It is so bad that it gave me as much trauma as Venom gave to Spider-Man.\n\nHopefully they change recipe, but until then, steer clear friends.",
