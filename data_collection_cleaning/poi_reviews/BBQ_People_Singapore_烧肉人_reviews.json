The taste of the dishes is ok, the sweet and sour pork ribs are not very tasty but the others are ok. The cold noodles are delicious, the environment in the store is noisy, and the smell of oily smoke is heavy, don't go if you mind",

No service charge üòù\n\nDrinks is self service (but need to pay later lah huh‚Ä¶)\n\nThe interesting part (or at least to me and my kids) is the egg around the pan‚Ä¶ kids love egg so the egg thingy is a welcome to both of them.\n\nService, in my humble opinion, is good. The lady is helpful in answering my wife‚Äôs question about the stir fried vegetables. (Cos not much of a crowd on Sunday night I guess)",

      "text": "Interesting extensive mix of Chinese Dongbei style and Korean BBQ on menu. Reasonable prices makes this place hugely popular with the Chinese migrant community and fills easily as the evening progresses. Does get a little boisterous, so will not be the right spot for that romantic dinner date.\n\nFood here is greatly satisfying. Who doesn't enjoy the ultimate combination of heaps of meat + plenty of booze? I especially enjoyed their in house made kimchi, still crunchy without being overly fermented.\n\nSpeedy service by the 2 friendly ladies in the dining room.",
