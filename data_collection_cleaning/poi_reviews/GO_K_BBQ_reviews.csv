Master Ji-Ning,5,"If you’re a meat lover, GO K BBQ at Bukit Timah Plaza is an absolute must-visit. I tried their Wagyu, and the marbling was insane — melt-in-your-mouth levels of rich, buttery flavor. You can really tell the meat quality is top-notch across the board.

One of the best parts? The staff actually cook the meat for you at the table, so there’s no stress about overcooking or undercooking anything. You just sit back, relax, and enjoy perfectly grilled bites every time. The service was super attentive and friendly too, which made the whole experience even better.

Highly recommend this spot if you’re craving Korean BBQ done right!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113014652293741710718/reviews
Rebecca C,5,"Recommended by a friend and really enjoyed the food here. Rice cake stew is super big serving and one of the highlights for tonight. Seafood pancake, I prefer it crispier hence grilled it further. I dont eat beef hence tried their aged pork. Pork belly is better than the pork neck as I prefer less tendon. Nice to have their expert staff grill meat for us. Yummy melona after! Will come back, make sure to reserve :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103796112025499301121/reviews
Salon Rei beauty & spa,5,"The quality of the meat is excellent.
I ordered both pork and beef and both were delicious.
I usually go to the one on Amoy street near my hair salon, but they ran out of meat, so I went to this one!
The service was very good and the handsome manager was very kind to me a lot!
I recommend you to try it!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100639906197559129734/reviews

derek neo,4,"Fantastic experience.  The beef, aged to perfection for 14 days, was incredibly tender and delicious.  We also enjoyed their cold noodle dish and seafood pancake, which were flavorful and well-prepared.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113015523826545524096/reviews
