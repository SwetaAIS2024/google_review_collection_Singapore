Amrin Jofri,5,"Today we're at Wild Wild Wet, wonderfully busy and crowded water park. Lucky to get the last cabana for the day. The weather was just lovely, a bit downcast but no rain. Lots of food outlets to feast on.
And E!Hub was great with everything you need, from f&b outlets, japanese supermarket, electronic to gadget stores, hairdressers to manicure/pedicure services. There's live entertainment and the cleaners always on standby to do their cleaning job.
Its was a wonderful weekend outing for the family...",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100105446098495566816/reviews

Weihoe Ow,5,"Love the amenities here!

Good mix of lifestyle, Health, Family and fashion shops. A good place to visit for Family (family friendly).

Might be lacking in big brands (not an issue for me) but you have a good variety of dining choices, fun and entertainment for the kids (Tayo station and roller skate ring).

And last but not least, it has Don Don Donki!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111243454339209943108/reviews
