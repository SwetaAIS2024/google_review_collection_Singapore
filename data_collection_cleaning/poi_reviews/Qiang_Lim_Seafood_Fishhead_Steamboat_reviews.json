Soggy and soft. Cereal prawns too much flour. Clay pot noodles tasteless. Sweet sour pork also soft and soggy. Better dishes - kang Kong, garlic tendon, salted chicken and crab meat tofu.\n\nBoss and staff friendly. Dishes served really fast. Service good.",

Fish Head Curry\n2. Har Cheong Gai (Prawn Paste Chicken)\n3. Cereal Prawns\n4. Pork Ribs\n5. Fried Rice - I’m a big fan of fried rice! I’m so glad that their fried rice comes with real medium sized prawns instead of the teeny weeny prawns & fake crab meat that many zhichar stalls serve in SG.\n\nThe service is friendly and efficient. The boss is super friendly and would joke with customers when he’s not too busy.\n\nWe came here for our Chinese New Year Reunion Dinner tonight. A total of 5 dishes only cost around $98. It’s very hard to find this kind of pricing in Singapore.\n\nIt’s my fav Zhichar place in the East.",
