Mao Seiken,5,You can see the Marina Bay Sands from here. There are a lot of plants. The plants have labels which also has information about it. I took time reading some of it while waiting for the rain to stop. Good thing there is an available roofing for the plants and for people who visit here.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112391541252214277058/reviews

Kit Teguh,4,"Yah okeh this is way better than that battered excuse of a supertree  thing, which wasn't even a tree by the way. My expectations for the rest of the day was a bit low after that, but sun pavilion got it back up again.

To be honest, I'm not much into plants, but it's still very nice to see the different range of plants that can grow under the one roof. Sadly, there's no giant carnivorous plants to snap up the annoying children.

The pavilion is like a giant glasshouse. I couldn't get enough from looking at the structures though. It looks weird and alien-like from the outside, but it is absolutely stunning inside. I think the ticket prices were still overpriced for what it is, which made me contemplate my life a little. But I realised it was a waste of time because as stunning as it was, this was a once and done kind of thing.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103661985185421749052/reviews
