In september. you charge me 100SGD to come for just a rewiring of my 2 door counter freezer.\n\nThen you tell me just rewiring. This time it is the same problem. Same symptom.\n\nBut your technician simply tell last time is this problem now is different problem with faulty capacitor.\nso why cant he change the capacitor in the first place? why do y'all just fix minorly and not address the underlying problems. If it is an issue with the compressor. that is different. but this is the same group of issue.\nWhy you cannot solve this the last time? it is literally same symptom. then every time break down I pay 100SGD?\n\nWorse still is now for labour its 130SGD? this dont make any professional sense.\n\nAnd when we buy Mok Lee Equipment. we are simply hostages.\n\nYour staff talk bad about their other colleagues which has nothing to do with me.\n\nI am so angry with your service. and I willl never ever come back to you anymore!\n\nThe industry is evolving and your competitors are more professional. Prices are not cheap as well. Terrible dated company.\n\nFor me to feel so strongly about this company is really something out of the ordinary.\n\nAvoid at all cost!",

Hence, I sent it to MokLee for disposal and Mr Wiliam (their boss) didn’t give up and explained that my oven is nice one and he helped to fix it at really reasonable price. With all Mok Lee team’s help I was able to bake my cake on time for my student and kept my promise to him.\n\nThe boss and the staffs are sincere and can trust.\n\nThank you so much!",
