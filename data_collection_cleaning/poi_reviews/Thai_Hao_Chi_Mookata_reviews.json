Feels like the franchised stores like siam mookata etc is better than this.\n\nPlatter $39.90 is ok, $9.90 abalone slice is abit ex but quite nice.. the plate is charred too easily and unable to scrap off, pork and chicken is quite nice though. The soup is quite plain, didnâ€™t order more and decided to go for 2nd round.\n\nWe were seated near the entrance but is still smoky, your entire body and hair will smell of the mookata after ðŸ˜…",

But hoping the place to have air vent to absorb the smoke, my sinus cannot take it haha. Overall nice experience! The set meal was worth the price",
