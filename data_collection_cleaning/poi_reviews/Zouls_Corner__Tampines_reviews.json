      "text": "Ordered via foodpanda and ate 1 hour after delivery. Food was still warm. Although chicken lost its crispiness as expected, I was surprised by the portion!! Chicken leg was huge and rice given was a lot. Chili from their signature set was really good. Personally preferred the white rice over the nasi goreng. I could taste that the white rice was cooked with chicken so it was very flavourful; not plain white rice! The tahu goreng was good for sharing too.\n\nAs for the mee hoon goreng, it was cooked malay style (duh) so it was like dry mee siam. Portion was so generous, I think can feed 2 adults!\n\nCannot believe I only tried this now! Will order again!",

What really impressed me was the sambal, it had that fiery kick and depth of flavour that made the whole dish come alive. You can tell they put care into every plate. Definitely coming back for more!",

The meat is well-marinated and the sambal adds the perfect sweet and spicy kick.\nCheese fries were loaded with sauce, jelak towards the end, but great for sharing.\nFast service located in a quiet corner, perfect for dinner in a big group.",
