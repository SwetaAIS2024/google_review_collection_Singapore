Kitty Hello,5,"Been here before but didn’t try their mee soto. Overall the taste was good. The area is very well ventilated based on the location. There are big fans at the wall. Just a little surprised to see the noodles was not properly separated. It was fully cooked though. Do opt out the chilli if cannot take too spicy food. It was pretty spicy for me.

I do agree that the cashier was a little rude.. well properly is her way of talking. She is just a loud person.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108252522171137420524/reviews
Bright Eyes,3,"Had Almond Sandwich Toast ($1.50) and Cocoa C ($1.40). Reasonably priced and good quality food and drinks. I’ve been here many times after doctor consultation. Food and drinks have never been disappointing. Service is below par.

Recommended for meals if you are around this area but have to bear with poor service. No wonder the overall rating is quite poor.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114200783271279069230/reviews
Herculie Phyo,1,"Mee Sian tasted so bland and watery, even the egg they give was a bit cold inside at the yolk.
So, i ordered chicken pau (thinking what can go wrong).. omg, the pau was so dry and tasteless.

I was hungry after fasting for blood test. Usually, when u r hungry, almost anything tastes good.. bit not the food from this earery.

Coffee was good though.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106610845876466158976/reviews
Michelle Tan,1,"Ordered a Mee Rebus and a bottle of Water and asked for an additional cup of ice. The man preparing the cup said “NO! I can give you another cup but no ICE!” He then proceeded to pour half the ice in the cup into another cup. I was shocked. I then asked if I could pay for more ice since the bottle of water is not cold and left on the counter? “$0.50!” He shot back!

So service? What service! I think this guy needs major up training on basic service let alone good customer service.

Atmosphere sucks as the tables are not clean and there are only two fans near the service counter but they don’t reach all the tables.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116709309796915169370/reviews
Ranjani Mahalingam,1,"Ordered butter sugar toast $1.50
Received one thick toast cut into 2. Asked the aunty is it $1.50 for just 1 piece of bread. She said yes. I asked if I should have ordered the brown thin bread so will have 2 slices. She said no cannot because the thin bread already do ready only have butter and kaya. For butter and sugar can only give thick bread.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104034954581217976767/reviews
