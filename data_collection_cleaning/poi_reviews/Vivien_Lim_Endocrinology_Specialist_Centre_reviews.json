Scheduled for another visit in a couple of months’ time.\n\nShe is fast, no nonsense and efficient - that may be why some of the reviews are critical without the benefit of details.\n\nShe, like me, does not waste time or suffer fools. She’s not there to hold your hands when she has a waiting room full of patients waiting their turns.",
