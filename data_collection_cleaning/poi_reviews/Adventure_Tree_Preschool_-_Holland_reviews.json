      "text": "We recently enrolled our child to Adventure Tree Preschool as we were looking for a school that prioritizes outdoor, unstructured play rather than a traditional ‘sit-in-the-classroom’ setting.\n\nWe’re so glad we found this preschool —it provides exactly what our child needed and more! She absolutely loves the outdoor playground and enjoys it so much that she never wants to leave at pick-up. The weekly water play and Le Petite Chef sessions add to the fun, making learning an engaging experience. We also appreciate the small teacher-to-student ratio, which allows for more personalized attention. The frequent updates and photo albums (sometimes up to three times a week!) really help put us at ease, knowing she’s happy and thriving.\n\nHighly recommend this wonderful school!",

      "text": "My daughter started here when she was 2.5 years old. It was a super easy transition. The school balances care/personalized attention to the little ones very well with academic & enrichment goals. I have seen my daughter's critical thinking skills and confidence flourish! They are also very focused on safety and hygiene which is very important for such young kids. A great mix of nationalities and they truly bring a play based approach to learning to life. Highly recommended!",
