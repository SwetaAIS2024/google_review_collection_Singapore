MNG,5,"A short walk from Zhenghua estate. It is along side of Rail corridor and worth a detour.

The observation tower gives a good view of the estate and does not have too many people during the afternoon.

At some parts of the trail, there are both hiking and cycling tracks.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
Hui Chin Chong,5,"Great tracking place for exercise while enjoying the nature. This is one of the natural walking tracks in Singapore with no tar roads. Hiking and biking trail are separated to ensure hikers and bikers enjoy themselves as much as possible.  During this period, can easily see fighter plane of RSAF flying for national day preparation while standing on top of observation tower.

Muhd Heidir,5,"When hiking to reach the tower, please avoid bicycle trails as the slopes are steep hence the bikes will be in high speed across rough terrain. Also during hot and warm weather, it is advisable to wear loose clothes and have sufficient water in a back pack. When in trails, keep left, always. If you are injured, get help and provide your GPS location to emergency responders. Stay safe and enjoy the hike!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106261161128576133795/reviews
