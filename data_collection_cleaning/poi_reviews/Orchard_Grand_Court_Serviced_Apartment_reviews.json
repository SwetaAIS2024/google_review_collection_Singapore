The one bedroom on floor 6/7 is perfect with a huge rounded window.\nThe staff from the time one arrives to senior management is exceptionally good. Friendly courteous accommodating and at one‚Äôs service at all times! The breakfast is good - a wide selection of hot food.\nThis establishment is strongly recommended. This is our 2nd year stay in a row and will certainly return. Kudos to Ms Coral who was went beyond her call of duty to assist and accommodate our request. Kudos to each and every member we came into contact with. Your service is appreciated üôèüôèüôè",

Kitchenette is well equipped and for all the basic needs there is a small supermarket just downstairs that‚Äôs open 24/7. Really convenient to Orchard Road and MRT station. The staff were all friendly and helpful for booking taxis or giving suggestions of places to go. We look forward to staying again!",

      "text": "My Wife and I stayed for 2 weeks at the Orchard Grand Court Serviced Apartments. Very clean apartment, good view from the 5th floor, nice shower and decent size fridge/freezer. Pool was used, good for novice or more experienced swimmers. Gym was used, had a good range of equipment, I used the treadmill, rowing machine and free weights. Used room service for food and drinks which was really nice. Breakfast included in apartment price was tasty, contained a range of delicious foods that changed through the week. Relaxed, friendly atmosphere.\nLocation is totally excellent as less than 10 mins walk from Somerset MRT and other lines within 20 mins walk distance.\nAll staff really friendly - in reception, the breakfast Crystal Cafe staff and all of the cleaning staff. Special thanks to the cleaning staff who serviced rooms daily, supplied tea/coffee items and were really friendly and helpful throughout our stay.\nBig local supermarket, right under the hotel! Fair prices.\nThe amazing area of Orchard Road 10 mins walk away, highly recommend a visit to Plaza Singapura!\n\nWould definitely consider staying here again. Location, service, staff and amenities all excellent. Thank you!",
