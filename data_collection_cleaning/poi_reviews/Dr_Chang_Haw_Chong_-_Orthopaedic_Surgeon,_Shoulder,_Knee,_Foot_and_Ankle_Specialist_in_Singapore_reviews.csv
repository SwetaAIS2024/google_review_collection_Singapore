Gerald Tan,5,Dr Chang is fantastic as he fixed both my knees and has given me back my quality of life.

Za Seow,5,"He‚Äôs the most morally upright Doc I‚Äôve seen ! Tells it as it is, doesn‚Äôt mince his words, doesn‚Äôt push any products and uses real examples (not those text books ones) to back up his results!
Dr Chang is a gem! Saw him for the nStride injection and his patience and calm demeanour really went a long way to put things in perspective! His recommendations of the offloader brace and physiotherapist were superb!
Thanks Dr Chang.. and thank you Celeste for facilitating my appointments!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117747102635081729459/reviews
Danny Kang,5,"I've had the pleasure of seeking Mr. Chang's expertise for three consultations. Unfortunately, I've had a series of accidents resulting in injuries to my right elbow, foot, and left knee at different times. What's truly impressive is Mr. Chang's ability to detect and accurately diagnose these injuries even before the MRI results are available. His deep knowledge and expertise allow him to explain every aspect of your condition and treatment plan in great detail and not forget the effective medicine prescription which evades the pain constantly.

In addition to Mr. Chang's exceptional care, his assistant Celeste has also been wonderful to work with. She is incredibly responsive and always goes the extra mile to answer any inquiries via WhatsApp, even outside of office hours.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107536161439195979813/reviews
