Lydia,5,"My morning started with an auntie cutting queue.  The lady in Yu Yi Coffee noticed and quickly brightened my the day by executing my order immediately and even brought the bread to the table. Yu Yi Coffee &Tea Hut has nice owners.  Ordered tea set. Bread is nice, crispy and not too dry. The tea is ok too, not too sweet (healthier version). Reasonably priced.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288322193757592257/reviews
