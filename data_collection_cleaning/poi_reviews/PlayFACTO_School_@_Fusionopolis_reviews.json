I couldnâ€™t recommend you more!",

PlayFacto created a comfortable environment for the children to rest, read and engage in various science / craft activities (alongside other enrichment boosters). The teachers were also very nurturing and caring about my son's development, both in terms of academics and character. I felt at ease with my son being there, knowing that he enjoyed himself and built great friendships!",
