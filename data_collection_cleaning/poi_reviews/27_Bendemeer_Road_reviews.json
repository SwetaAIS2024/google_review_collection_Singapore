      "text": "The noodle house had bad customer service where they blamed the customers for taking the wrong order and had to come to the table to tell us off. Sure they did exchange the noodle to the right order but I don’t think we deserve such bad service. The fried fish is also more of fried batter with tiny fish inside. The utensils from the other rice noodle stall was pretty dirty too. Overall horrible experience here.",
