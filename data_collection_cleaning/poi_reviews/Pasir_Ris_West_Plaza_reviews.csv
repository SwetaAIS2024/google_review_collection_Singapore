A N (Haha),1,"Pasir Ris West Plaza.
Very stupid design after renovation.
They could have designed the place to be more enviromental friendly. First off they built a high window yet all closed up with barely enough of air circulation. And to have to install large ceiling fan for better circulation whereby there is no necessity as in the past the previous design it was an open air area. Now they even promote atrium indoor cooking and the whole place smells of cooking oil.And we are in a deep fryer.I think the designer thinks it cool for the new design and better facade. Sorry I think the designer or contractor needs to have a better understanding what is call saving electricity. See the photos which is self explanatory.More dumb design these days. So much for efficient designed building.All close up no fresh air circulation.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106795858225899184398/reviews
