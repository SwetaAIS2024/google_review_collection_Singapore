Harry,5,"Island Kitchen Penang is easily one of my all-time favouritesâ€”their food has never let us down. I just tried their Braised Pork Belly with Salted Fish, and wow, it was absolutely superb! It might just be my new top pick. Though to be fair, Iâ€™ve had a few favourites here before tooâ€”like their Fried Pork with Belacan, Penang Char Kway Teow, and the rich, Asam Curry Fish Head. Every dish is a hit!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111462419026356951191/reviews
Evelyn,5,"This is one of our regular favourite spots!

The char kway teow (#201) is super nice, full of flavours with great char taste. We gotta order 2nd plate ðŸ˜†

3 sour juice (#602) is a MUST TRY to those who love SOUR (sugar syrup is optional).

The desserts are tasty! I love both their Chendol and Aloe Vera (#502) served with shaved ice. A go-to for a hot sunny day in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬

Forgot to mention, their service is super efficient, though thereâ€™s NO SERVICE CHARGE to be paidðŸ˜Š",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100752907852147302568/reviews
Brandon Wong,5,"Was there on a Sunday afternoon around 1:15pm, had a 15mins wait before seated as shop was fully packed with lunch crowd. Ordering was done using order sheet, food was served promptly, tasted delicious and authentic. Definitely worth coming back again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112124406115202450220/reviews
Ribeye,4,"Island Penang Kitchen serves up an impressive selection of authentic Penang dishes in a simple, casual environment. With orders coming quick out of the kitchen, the Penang Char Kway Teow stands out with its smoky wok hei and a perfectly balanced mix of prawns, Chinese sausage, and pork lard.

The Fish Curry is another highlight, rich and flavorful, making it a must-try for curry lovers. The menu features single-sized portions, ideal for sampling multiple dishes in one visit. For dessert, the Chendol is a dependable option, delivering a refreshing sweetness to round off the meal.

The setting is no-frills, but it complements the focus on great food at wallet-friendly prices. As a fast-casual spot, it doesnâ€™t take reservations, so be prepared for potentially long waits during peak hours. Despite this, service is efficient, and the turnover ensures a steady flow of seating.

Island Penang Kitchen is a great place to enjoy authentic Penang flavors without breaking the bank, perfect for casual outings and food enthusiasts alike.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108129213100021627372/reviews
C,5,"Had dinner on a Friday, and the place was almost packed, which speaks to its popularity. Island Penang Kitchen, located in the heart of West Coast, is a go-to spot for those craving authentic Malaysian cuisine. Specializing in Penang-style dishes, the restaurant offers a menu packed with rich flavors, from fragrant Char Kway Teow to comforting Assam Laksa. The ambiance is casual and unpretentious, with a homely feel that makes it perfect for a relaxed meal. Service is friendly and efficient, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. I especially enjoyed their signature Char Kway Teow, which had the perfect balance of smoky wok hei and rich flavors. If youâ€™re in the area and looking for a taste of Penang, this spot is definitely worth a visit.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
