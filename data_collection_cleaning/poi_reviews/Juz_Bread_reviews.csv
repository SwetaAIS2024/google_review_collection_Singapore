BABY GERM,2,"It was served hot with a chewy texture. The peanut filling was more of a smooth, watery spread rather than the crunchy type.

I didnâ€™t have to wait longâ€”probably about 10 minutes.

Fyn Lye,1,"Bread was okay but service is very bad. I paynow wrongly $16. It was supposed to be $1.60 (Okay my mistake) So they ask me to go to bank to revert. Cannot. I went back to them. They say boss not in. Give me the phone talk to the admin handling finance, the admin told me, it was your mistake to key in wrongly, not ours. ðŸ¤¯ I am like, Ehat?!! So I canâ€™t get my 15.60$ remaining back. The guy in the shop gave me a number to call. I asked is it the boss? He said no, some admin or PA handling for boss, she can make decisions. I called this morning, NUMBER NOT IN SERVICE.

I just want my $15.60 back, so hard?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109547181767683101355/reviews
