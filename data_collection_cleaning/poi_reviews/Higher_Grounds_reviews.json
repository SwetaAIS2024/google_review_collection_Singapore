Their menu features tasty light bites and a tempting selection of homemade cakes—especially the blueberry and banana cakes, which are so popular they sell out fast! On Saturdays, the café serves hearty, comforting main meals that are perfect for the whole family. With warm, attentive staff who make every visit feel special, it’s a place you’ll want to come back to again and again.",
