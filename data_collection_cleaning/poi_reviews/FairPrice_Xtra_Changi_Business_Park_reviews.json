It offers good discounts on the grocery, juices, chocolates, vegetables, fruits and many things.\nWith Christmas coming in, they already had many things to sell at discounted prices.\nDo not forget to buy FairPrice Guava Juice if you love to drink juices.\nAlso, it has direct connectivity with Expo MRT and that's the best thing I liked.",
