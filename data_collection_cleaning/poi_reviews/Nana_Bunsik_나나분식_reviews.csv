Zhi Wei Goh,5,"This is where you can come and find a comfort, heart warming Korean food in the West of SG. We had the ramyeon, especially heart warming on a rainy evening, plus the fish cake soup. The wide variety of gimbaps also gave us a hard time choosing where in the end we had tonkatsu and kimchi + spam. Gimbaps are freshly made and definitely sufficiently full for an adult. Good place to order a variety to share!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112019283576126967125/reviews
Rebecca Tan,5,"Came for lunch on friday and it was not crowded. Love the peace. Food is great! Finally found somewhere to try gimbap! Yummy!! Sides are not refillable though. Love the potato salad and sample sized anchovies!

Shall try some other dishes next round!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117326242815467661826/reviews

Wei Qi,3,"Had dinner here with my fam during a weekend.
Food was alright but nothing to shout about. The toppoki did not really standout from the sauce, the fried stuffs were nice to be used to dip with the toppoki sauce to eat. Gimbap and the rest were normal fare. Shop is a little cramp though as they tried to have more tables and chairs to serve more customers.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104650432615000308719/reviews
Irin Ong,5,Visited this cozy cafe and was impressed by the friendliness of the staffs. They offer wide variety of Korean food.  All our ordered dishes tasted yummy and price is so…. reasonable too. The side dishes are so nice that we bought back the take home pack to share this goodies with family.  The staff even make effort to check on us as they really make our dining very enjoyable. This will be our future hang out eating place. They are so kind even accommodating my dog to be on pram at their out door seating area 👍👍👍,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117895270007922056319/reviews
