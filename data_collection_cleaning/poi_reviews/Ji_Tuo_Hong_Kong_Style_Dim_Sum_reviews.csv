Kyemeng Lee,5,"Situated on 9th floor of a factory in Bukit Batok. Internally was rather warm. Went on a Sunday at around 10 plus and surprisingly there were quite a number of people there, although there were still plenty of seats free. Dim Sum was reasonably priced and overall quality is better than those generic dim sum available. The dried shrimp chilli was superb. Standout for me was siew mai, crispy beancurd skin roll, fried carrot cake and lotus leaf glutinous rice.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100448704022787083341/reviews
Vin W,4,"I recently visited this dim sum place located on level 9 of an industrial space. The dim sum we ordered surpassed our expectations, outshining even some of the popular coffeeshops we've tried.

A standout highlight was their speciality sambal, which boasted a perfect balance of mild spiciness, sweetness, and savory tiny shrimps. It was truly appetizing!

However, be prepared for a wait â€“ we experienced a wait of around 40 minutes, likely due to the public holiday.

Overall, this dim sum spot is definitely worth a visit, and I look forward to returning to try more of their offerings.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109263427873687540100/reviews
Daniel Wong,4,"As it was a Sunday, the whole JTC industrial building was totally quiet so it was a surprise that the canteen was full of people.
The items was quite limited so we tried most of it. Overall it was quite good for the price. The steamed pork ribs was the best dish, the meat was tender and full of flavour.
The other items are nice too but do not expect the quality to be the same as dim sum restaurants where you will pay double the price.
The only disappointment was the carrot cake. Although there was enough radish in it, the texture was too soft.
Special mention to the chilli which you can help yourself at the counter. It's very good and tasty from all the dried shrimps in it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115145949078497107987/reviews
Ziv Charles,5,"Dimsum with a great view
Although it's 32 degree C outside, the outside sitting is cooling enough. The aunties and uncle manning the store are very nice and patient.
Love their shrimp chilli, siew mai and fried carrot cake.
Would mind if their char siew bao is smaller with more fillings. The osmanthus 'cake' is a nice dessert to end the meal. Cooling and sweet.
Free parking on Sunday :)",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115726310063251234439/reviews
Joe Soh,4,"Visited on a Sunday. Not crowded when we arrived. But customers continue to stream in.

Ordering is by marking on the order chit (menu) and passing to the friendly lady at the cashier.

They prepare the orders upon order and it took some time. I belive the wait will be long if it is crowded.

Ordered those dim sum in the photo and they were all good!

The price is affordable and food is tasty. Will be back",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102905388784843472647/reviews
