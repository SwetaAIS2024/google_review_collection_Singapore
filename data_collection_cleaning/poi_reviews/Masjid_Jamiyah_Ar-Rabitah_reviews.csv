Jasim uddin,5,"The first masjid was built in 1960.
Redeveloped in 1985 on the same site as the old masjid, this three-storey cream structure can accommodate up to 2000 people. Today, the masjid in Central part of the island serves the needs of residents in Redhill, Tiong Bahru and Alexandra areas, besides the office workers at the nearby industrial estates. Besides madrasah and kindergarten classes, it organizes regular religious classes for the adults.

Amar Koul,5,"Masya Allah. This masjid is located within the Redhill area. What a huge expanse this masjid is in. In spite of the large area, the interiors are very well-maintained, clean and comfortable. Kudos to the mosque staff who switches on the a/c system during solat Terawih, making it very conducive for the congregants.

If youâ€™re coming here as a driver (like me), make sure to indicate your GPS to 150096 or 150104. These are MSCPs nearest to the mosque but still around a 5-7 minute walk. It is only however a walking distance from Redhill MRT station.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100276120372481396557/reviews
Amran Ghani,5,"Tip-top facilities, the manager especially provided for the hospitabilty of visitors. The second level (main prayer hall) has a close-to-nature feel. There's actually a regular visiting civet cat family. The view from the prayer hall is also nice. Air-conditioning is on whenever they have large gatherings.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105032613507551403992/reviews
