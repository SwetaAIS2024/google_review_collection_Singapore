      "text": "Dr Irene took care of my root canal and Dr Tan on the crown.\n\nI neglected my tooth many years back due to some very bad experience with dentist who was quite rude.\n\nMy colleague recommended Dr Irene and she was meticulous and ever so kind in explaining each step. The root canal was undertaken with care and discovery of new crack etc was duly informed and handled.\n\nDr Tan for the crown was a perfectionist to ensure fit and comfort. He never rush through the procedure and took time to explain and effort to ensure the crown made was optimal.\n\nSincere thanks and kudos to both of them. Both procedures were almost  painless. Well I am a fan now.",
