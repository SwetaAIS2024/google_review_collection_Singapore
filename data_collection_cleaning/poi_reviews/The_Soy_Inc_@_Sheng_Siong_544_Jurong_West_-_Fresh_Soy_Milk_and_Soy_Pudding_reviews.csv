Ivan Lam,4,"Unique take on the traditional beancurd. Apart from beancurd and soya milk, this outlet also sells muah chee and waffle as well as their very own gelato. There are also seating areas for diners to dine in.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112403987693678430009/reviews
J.N.,5,"First came across their soy beancurd and soy bean drink while grocery shopping at a Sheng Siong outlet. Contacted them via direct message on instagram to enquire about about their halal certification and was attended to very efficiently by their staff. Thank you for the good and fast service. Beancurd and drink tastes delightful; with just the right amount of sweetness. Grateful to find halal beancurd and soybean drink!
