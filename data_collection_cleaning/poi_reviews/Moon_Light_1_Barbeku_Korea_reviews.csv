Bernard Ong,5,"Missed Korean BBQ from jeju. Hence, my wife brought us here to try out. Liked the environment very cooling evening usually.

Enjoyed the food very much. Beef n pork were fantastic. Especially last serving was pork belly!! well cooked by the staff ^_^v. Nice n fresh side dish. Compared to Singapore... =_="" (lets end it here)

Good service.!

Ps: Sadly doesnt have touch n go. Only cash or credit. Well, small matter.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115391634503009241978/reviews

Very delicious even the side dishes are so tasty, can refills!
