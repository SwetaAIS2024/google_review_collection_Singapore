      "text": "5-Star Review for Josiah Suntec\n\nWe couldn‚Äôt be happier with our experience at Josiah Suntec! From the moment we enrolled, the staff has shown genuine care and dedication to every child‚Äôs growth and well-being. The teachers are warm, nurturing, and incredibly skilled at creating a fun and engaging learning environment.\n\nThe curriculum is well-rounded, focusing not just on academics but also on social and emotional development. Our child has blossomed in confidence, creativity, and curiosity since starting here. The activities are thoughtfully designed to be both educational and enjoyable, with plenty of opportunities for hands-on learning.\n\nCommunication with parents is outstanding, with regular updates, photos, and newsletters that keep us informed about our child‚Äôs progress and daily adventures. The facilities are clean, safe, and equipped with age-appropriate materials that encourage exploration.\n\nWe‚Äôve also loved the sense of community at Josiah Suntec. Festive celebrations bring everyone together, making it feel like an extended family.\n\nWe highly recommend Josiah Suntec to any parent looking for a loving and enriching preschool experience. It‚Äôs truly a place where children thrive and develop a lifelong love for learning!",

      "text": "Josiah Suntec is a very impressive outlet. Their staffs are all very attentive and alert to each and every child‚Äôs character. They are able to capture the children‚Äôs attention and made learning fun, making them looking forward to go to school every morning. Our child went for foreign exchange for a period of time, and the teachers made sure they finish all the syllabus in advance so there won‚Äôt be any issue of being unable to catch up upon returning. The principal is very thoughtful with the planning of their curriculum, from learnings to playtime. The operational staffs are very alert and knows what‚Äôs happening in the centre as well. The growth here is very significant among the peers from elsewhere. Nothing to complain about! Well done Josiah! üëèüèª",

      "text": "Enrolling our baby in Josiah Suntec Infant Care has been one of the best decisions we‚Äôve ever made for her. She has grown so much and learned an incredible amount during her time here. From mastering age-appropriate self-help skills to communicating with baby sign language, her development has been remarkable. Her love for music has also been beautifully nurtured in this environment.\n\nA special thanks to Ms. Xiuling and her team for their exceptional care and dedication. They consistently go above and beyond to ensure every child is well taken care of.\n\nAs we now prepare to graduate, we know we‚Äôll deeply miss this wonderful preschool. Ms. Fion and all the teachers have become such an integral part of her early years. Thank you for making this journey so meaningful for us!",
