Catherine Luker,5,"I've been here for a few concerts now, and they're always so well organized, and staff are super friendly - saying goodbye and thank you on the way out. We didn't get our VIP gift on the way in by mistake, but it was really easy to find someone afterward and get it by just showing our ticket. I'll be back again soon I'm sure :)",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114526667589350467334/reviews
devanshi shah,4,"Attended J-hopeâ€™s Hope On The Stage concert that happened on April 26 and 27, 2025.
The queues was so precise, everything had a place and the staff working in security and ticket scanning were absolute angels!
The entire concert experience was super good except that as someone standing closer to the barricade, and could not move, water was only given by staff to people who were fainting or had medical emergencies till the end of the concert where then they started giving water.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118039471752461522271/reviews
Happy Bird,5,"Disney on ice was incredible. So was the Singapore indoor stadium. After all these years, the indoor stadium has held up and continues to be a great venue for world class acts and performances. For those who love Disney, don't miss this one. Only here for a week. Don't think, just go.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108716533290322327726/reviews
Nicolas weng kan,5,"The stadium was reconfigured for a Taeyong concert. We were in the pit and very close to the stage. The whole place was air conditioned which is a must in hot and humid Singapore. Access was quite easy despite the large crowd and we were admitted in the stadium in less than 10 mins including security checks and tickets checks.
Small food stall for drinks and some food inside the grounds.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104973669149643793795/reviews
