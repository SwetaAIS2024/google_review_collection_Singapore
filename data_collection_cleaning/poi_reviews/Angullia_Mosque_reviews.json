      "text": "Tucked right along bustling Orchard Road, Masjid Angullia is a serene escape from the fast pace of the city. This mosque may not be large, but it holds great historical and spiritual significance, being one of the oldest mosques in Singapore, established in the late 1800s.\n\nThe prayer hall is simple yet dignified, with good air circulation and well-kept amenities. Ablution areas are clean and conveniently located.\n\nYou can often find travelers stopping by for prayers or to admire the historic architecture.\n\nAccessibility: Very easy to reach – just a short walk from Orchard MRT station. It’s a convenient stop for Muslim shoppers or tourists needing a nearby place for prayer.\n\nAngullia Mosque beautifully balances tradition and accessibility. It's a spiritual gem amidst the modernity of Singapore’s shopping belt.",

      "text": "Tucked away in the vibrant streets of Little India, Singapore, the Angullia Mosque stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of the Angullia family, one of the oldest Gujarati Muslim families in the country. Established in 1890 by merchant and philanthropist Mohammed Salleh Eusoff Angullia, the mosque was built to serve the growing Muslim community in the area. Over the years, it has undergone several renovations, evolving from a simple place of worship to a modern mosque while maintaining its historical significance. Little India, known for its rich cultural tapestry, is an unexpected yet fitting home for a mosque that reflects Singapore’s diverse heritage. Surrounded by bustling markets, temples, and shophouses, Angullia Mosque continues to be a spiritual refuge amid the liveliness of the district. Today, it stands as not only a place of prayer but also a symbol of the contributions of early Indian-Muslim traders in shaping Singapore’s multicultural identity.\n\nThe story of Indian migration extends far beyond Singapore. Under British colonial rule, millions of Indians were sent across the world as laborers, traders, and administrators, leaving a lasting impact in places thousands of miles from their homeland. Hindi is still spoken today in Fiji, an island nation over 11,600 km (7,200 miles) from India, as a result of indentured laborers being taken there in the 19th century. Meanwhile, in South America, Guyana—a country where nearly one-quarter of the population is Muslim—has a sitting president of Indian Muslim descent, Irfaan Ali, whose roots trace back to Uttar Pradesh. Guyana itself is over 14,000 km (8,700 miles) from India, yet the cultural and religious ties remain strong, a testament to how migration has shaped Muslim communities across the world. The Indian diaspora’s journey is one of resilience, adaptation, and the preservation of faith and culture, with places like Angullia Mosque standing as reminders of these enduring connections.\n\n#ramadan30days30mosques #ramadan #mosque #mosques #ramadanchallenge #islam #muslim #holymonth #tourism #travel #singapore #bangladeshi",
