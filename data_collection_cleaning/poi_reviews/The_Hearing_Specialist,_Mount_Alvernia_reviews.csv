Kristie Lu,5,"Terence the senior audiologist was very patient ,thorough and detailed in his explanation when I brought my 80 plus year old primary school retired teacher there for a hearing aid and hearing assessment. He explained to my elderly teacher how to care for his hearing aid so that it can last longer and addressed all our queries on the dos and donts  in charging  and proper maintenance of a hearing aid.👍🏻🙏🏻",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103875424420887143055/reviews
