The spoons and forks on the table mostly aren’t properly cleaned.\n\nAnd to the kakak (maybe the owner?), please don’t scold your staff in front of customers—it really ruined the mood.",

Also ordered the mee bandung, they used the thinner type of yellow noodles, portion also generous full with meat, pouched egg and decent amount of big prawns, can tasted the udang kering in the broth, but the broth little bit too sweet for my liking. Shop surrounding was calm, u may sit outdoor. Based on their price and portion it's definitely worth for your money. They had other food options on their menu, surely will try on our next visit. But still their keuteow was their killer menu.",
