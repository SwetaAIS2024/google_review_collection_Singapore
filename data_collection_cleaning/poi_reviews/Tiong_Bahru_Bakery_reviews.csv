Angelia Ong,4,"Tiong Bahru Bakery never disappoints with its inviting vibe and a menu that brings both comfort and flair.

I started off with a latte, topped with elegant latte art ‚Äî almost too pretty to drink. While the milk was creamy and well-textured, the coffee leaned a little on the bitter side, which might suit strong coffee lovers more than those looking for something mellow.

The croque monsieur was absolutely satisfying ‚Äî thick, crusty bread stacked with gooey cheese and a savory layer of ham, toasted to golden perfection. Rich, hearty, and comfortingly indulgent ‚Äî just what you'd hope for from this classic French dish.

The highlight, though, was the roast beef croissant sandwich. The croissant was fresh and buttery, flaking just right with each bite. Inside, tender slices of roast beef were paired with crisp lettuce, juicy cherry tomatoes, and what tasted like caramelized onions ‚Äî a beautiful balance of flavors and textures.

Overall, Tiong Bahru Bakery serves up a delightful mix of French-inspired fare with local caf√© charm. Ideal for a relaxed brunch or a cozy coffee date.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107075617145166914342/reviews

Anson Chew,4,"I ordered the Roast Beef Croissant, Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese Croissant, Black Pepper Crab Pie, and Earl Grey Lavender Tea. The prices are on the higher side for croissants, but after learning that they bake their croissants fresh every two hours and serve them hot, I began to understand why. The croissants are warm, flaky, and delicious, making them worth the splurge.

However, something that left me puzzled was the service. Even with a 10% service charge, customers still queue for order, have to fetch their own cutlery and refill their hot water for tea. For the price and the service charge, I would have expected a bit more attention to those details. Despite this, the quality of the food does stand out, especially if you appreciate freshly baked pastries.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114748016520143042702/reviews
