      "text": "My daughter has been attending this student care for six months, and overall, the experience has been positive. As a primary 1 student my daughter has benefited greatly from the academic support provided. The school's worksheets are particularly helpful, ensuring that she stays on track with her studies.\n\nOne of the standout features of this student care I really like is their strong support for working mothers. They assist with the child's school work, including spelling, which takes a significant load off our shoulders. This dedicated support ensures that my kid gets the help she needs while I'm at work, allowing me to have play time with her in the evening after work.\n\nAnother aspect we appreciate is the school bus service. The convenience of having picked up directly from her school CHIJ OLN is invaluable.\n\nIn summary, the student care has provided excellent academic support and has been a great help to both my husband and myself. Kudos to the teachers at Playfacto S9 esp Olyna class :)",

      "text": "My daughter have been attending Playfacto for almost 2 years and they have been instrumental in supporting my child's learning journey. Love their App as I'm alerted whenever my child reaches student care, gives us working mums a sense of security.\nWould like to specially mention Teacher michelle from P2 Pelata, she's very dedicated and loving. She maintains open communication with us parents and provide regular updates on my child's progress. My child is really blessed to have her as a teacher!\nIt's reassuring to see my child thriving academically and socially under their care. And most importantly, she enjoys going to playfacto daily and even requests for me not to pick her up so early..",
