If it had just a bit more wok hei and hotter would definitely be 5 stars for me. Nevertheless, recommend.\nPs:\n(There's a fruit juice stall just diagonally opposite, between a roast meat shop and a muslim food stall has pretty decent fruit juices, i had the ABC to wash down the thai food, was good).",

Only the diluted green curry chicken disappoints. Rest of food is great -\nFried fish with fish sauce\nBalacan Kangkong\nGarlic pork\nThai fried chicken\nPrawn bean curd\nFried Tang Hoon\nWill be back again to try other dishes üòã",
