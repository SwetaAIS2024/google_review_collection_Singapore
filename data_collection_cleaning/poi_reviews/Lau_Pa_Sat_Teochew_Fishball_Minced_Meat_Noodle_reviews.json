      "text": "Chance upon this stall selling fishball noodle sometime back while running some errands around this area, they were already closed for that day. Came back the following day at a much earlier time. There wasn’t any queue when I came back, managed to order upon reaching the stall. Price for the minced meat noodle starts from SGD$4 onwards,\n\nThe bowl of noodle came with a variety of ingredients likefishcake, pork slices, dumpling, minced pork , fish paste dumpling, fishball and meatball. Noodle were nicely cooked, texture of the noodle was springy. Sauce was well balanced too. Portion was quite generous, as it was a filling meal.\n\nOverall, I think that this is an above average bowl of noodle and wouldn’t mind eating it again.",
