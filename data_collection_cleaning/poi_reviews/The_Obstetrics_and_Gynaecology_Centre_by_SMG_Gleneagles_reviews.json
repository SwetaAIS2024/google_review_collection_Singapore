      "text": "It is by sheer random luck (google search while I happened to be standing below Gleneagles) that I ended up with Dr Watt as my OB. I saw a number of OBs and Dr Wattâ€™s very evidence based approach and kindness was just what I needed and made it easy to entrust our care to her.\n\nShe has been so steady, reliable, direct and kind. Her advice and recommendations are provided objectively based on the prevailing body of evidence yet always tinged with optimism. As first time parents, her guidance has been invaluable in walking us through this journey and I am grateful for her patience which I have tried many times with endless questions and worries.\n\nThe nurses, Shu Mei and Bee Yeng, and Dr Watt clearly work very well and efficiently together which makes them a great team. In particular, Shu Mei is especially caring to heavily pregnant women and so nice to talk to and Bee Yeng is on top of your queries and they are well relayed to Dr Watt for your continuum of care. Having a great front desk supported by nurses also makes this clinic stand out, on top of having an excellent doctor.",

      "text": "Dr Watt is a fantastic doctor who truly cares for her patients' health and well-being. She patiently, thoroughly and clearly explains the diagnosis and treatment options, gives me plenty of time to ask questions and digest the information, and puts my mind at ease with her warm, caring and reassuring bedside manner. I did a clinical procedure and a day surgery with her and can honestly say Dr Watt is one of the best doctors I've ever met. She is a rare gem of a medical expert who also has high EQ, and shows the utmost care for her patients' physical health as well as mental/emotional well-being & ease of mind. Her staff is also very well-trained, professional, friendly and courteous. They are able to explain processes/procedures/rationale clearly and consistently, and they follow up with patients before surgeries etc. Highly recommended!!",
