It's a great place for someone who does not have the headspace to think about what to do next in their workout (as you can just follow the video while doing circuit training). There is zero judgement from gym goers as everyone is there just to workout in peace. No hogging of machines as the gym goers cycle through the machines during circuit training. Staff are friendly and very casual, no upselling of packages or any of that sort if you're not interested.",
