Suresh,5,"To experience real indian tamil cinema celebration outside of India, this is the place.
I went for GOAT, the movie was celebrated inside the cinema as of its a carnival. The joyous Mood was so catchy and we also started dancing at the stage when the dance songs came in. Absolutely an experience oneuat catch in a lifetime - whether you are an Indian or not. But you have to go for the right movie to experience it. So consult your Indian friends.
Check it out.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109071993670066349908/reviews
Scribbling Geek,4,"Singaporean film-lovers’ venue for arty and indie films, and some mainstream features. The retro seats at the Green Room and Red Room are on VERY steep tiers, and leg room is quite limited, but the ambience is like few other places in the country and if you love that, you’d wanna come here again and again.

Staff is very friendly and approachable, whether at the box office or at Intermission Bar. Oh, despite the older-world feeling, the equipment here is the same as any modern cinema in Singapore. The audio system and picture quality are on par with any of the swanky multiplexes elsewhere.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111562642484326521942/reviews
Sanjay Khandagale,4,"The theater is big and good overall but the Golden Mile Tower itself is poorly maintained, in terms of cleanliness and maintenance.
Also please note that when I went the toilet in box office area was closed so went to ground floor amd back 3rd floor walking as lifts were overcrowded which is okay, but later on we found out there is a gents toilet inside the theater itself.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103946712832147026087/reviews

Trinath Vajinepalli,3,"Watched kalki movie here. Place is bigger than other theaters I have been to. Seats are not very comfortable.
Sound system is just above average. It kind of smelled like mould in the theater.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100450022213286075763/reviews
