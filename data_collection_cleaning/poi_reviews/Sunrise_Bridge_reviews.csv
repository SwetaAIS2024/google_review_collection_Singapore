Saifu Angto,4,"Nice bridge at the end of the nice river walkway whether you walk, jog, or bike.  Nice view back on the river or open view toward Coney island.  A good place to catch the breeze on a hot day.  The winding plank walkway down below add to the picturesque photo against the green water backdrop and the red Lor Halus Red Bridge.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
Harish,5,"We love this red bridge and quiet often pass through this. However, I recently took my 7-year-old daughter to this new playground which was opened recently quiet near to the red bridge and sunrise bridge. I was really impressed with the design and thoughtfulness that went into it. The playground is suitable for children of all ages, from toddlers to school-age kids. There are several rope-based climbs, spinning wheels, and tunnels, as well as slides and a sand pit. My daughter had a blast exploring all the different structures. She especially loved the rope based climbing structures. Families visiting the bridge can take a small detour if kids want some fun.

I was also impressed with the safety features of the playground. There are soft fall surfaces under all the equipment, and the playground is fenced in to keep children safe. I felt very comfortable letting my daughter play although I supervise her.

Overall, I was very impressed with this playground. It's a great place for kids of all ages to have fun and get some exercise. I would definitely recommend it to other parents.

Here are some of the things I liked about the playground:

* It's well-designed and safe for children of all ages.
* There are a variety of activities to choose from, so kids of all interests can find something to enjoy.
* The playground is clean and well-maintained.
* It's located in a convenient location (next to the sunrise bridge), making it easy for families to get to.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111186510888423431957/reviews
