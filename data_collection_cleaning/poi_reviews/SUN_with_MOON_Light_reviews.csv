But the atmosphere is pretty unbearable, as there is no aircon or minimal. It was so hot, me and my mum quickly finish the hot food and left.\nFood quality was not of standard. Such as the udon was mushy. The octopus for the spring collection was tough and hard to chew. And the rice was pretty hard to chew as well. And as for one of the side dishes, the cheese mochi, it seems hastily prepared, as there were specks of white salt thrown on the dish before two of the mini mochi were placed on it. I am puzzled by this, as the cheese mochi is slightly salty and why would there be more salt being placed? And in most quality japanese restaurants the condiments would at least be placed on the side or not at all to not disturb the original taste of the food. I looked through the other reviews and I saw the exact cheese mochi dish, and the salt was not present. Thus, this leads me to believe it was of carelessness or unintention by the chef and was overlooked before serving.\n\nThe good part is the service is good and fast.', 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': 'There is a 90 mins limit for dine in.
