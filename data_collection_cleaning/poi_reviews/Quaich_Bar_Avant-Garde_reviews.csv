Andri S,5,"Found this bar next to the JW hotel in Singapore and we had last drinks every night as service was great and it was a cute place with a table inside, high tables & lounge chairs outside! Had some starters on our last night and everything was delicious. Thank you Yuki for looking after us during our stay!

Paul Toh,5,"This is the place to be if you like a quiet place and just hang out with the boys over scotch and cigars.
The service by Zhichen is really good. Took the time to explain the whiskeys and recommended a few bottles based on our tastes.  He even allowed us to taste a limited edition just to see if we like to get one ourselves.
This bar is nicely located not too far from the main road so you get all the breeze while enjoying the cigar too.
All in all an awesome gentleman‚Äôs night out.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110584107240453374/reviews
