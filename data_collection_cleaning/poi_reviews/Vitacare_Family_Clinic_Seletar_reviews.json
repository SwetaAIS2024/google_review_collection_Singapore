      "text": "Both front desk receptionist at fernvale have huge issues managing the Q system and totally dishonest. Told us that we are next in Q, however another person came later with the Q number later than us got to see the doctor first. This was not the first occurrence and the reason why we came back is only because of the doctors are good and medications are effective. The management should really relook into the competency of their front desks staff. There is no point taking Q number when the sequence is random. If there are other cases that are more critical to be seen first, at least the staff should be transparent enough to inform us instead of keep saying we are next.",
