Jay Lee,4,"Small, cozy cafe at Galaxis serving specialty coffee and a solid range of matcha. Had the yuzu citron matcha and matcha latte—both whisked to perfection. Their matcha is strong and unique creations are definitely worth a try.

Knocking off a star for the price—you’ll definitely feel it in your wallet, with a base (Nishioo) iced oat matcha latte costing $9.90. Easily one of the priciest spots in One-North, though the quality does hold up.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106497275102504835365/reviews
Ong Zhi Yuan,4,"A cosy establishment setup in Galaxis, they sell a variety of matcha drinks that are earthy and delicious. If you are a matcha fan, it's a place you should definitely try out.

A unique attraction of the store comes from their staff making matcha, including the whisking process, by the front window. This means you get to witness the matcha making process while you are waiting for your drinks to be served, adding on to the dining experience.

The matcha itself is creamy, earthy, and thick without feeling overpowering. The latte version blends the milk well with the matcha, too.

A must visit, in my opinion! Do note that seats are rather limited due to the small size of the store. 8/10",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104417804420531473764/reviews
Jeena Hey,5,"We visited a small matcha store with just a few seats. It's a cozy place, and we went there during lunchtime. We had the Yabukita latte and Houjucha latte, both of which tasted milky. I'm looking forward to trying the Yuzu Citron next time.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113552326796326120362/reviews
mmmpypy,4,"The Matcha-Choco and Matcha Yuzu are a dream! The flavors blend together for something really unique. The matcha itself is super creamy and thick, just how it should be. The space is a little cozy, but it gives off such a chill vibe.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100568733733265111444/reviews
Han Htun Zaw,5,"Cute little cafe… went there around 3pm weekdays and it’s quite empty. Staffs are friendly.

One north MRT exit B and turn left, left, u will found it. Tried strawberry matcha and hojicha. Worth to try",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106820701068213584820/reviews
