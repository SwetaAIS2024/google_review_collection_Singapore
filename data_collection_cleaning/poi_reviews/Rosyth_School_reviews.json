The library also offers a wide variety of books. Teachers are also very skilled at teaching(most of them).Great school for your child.",

      "text": "The teachers teach rlly well and are quite approachable. They encourage students to approach them if in doubt, and they rlly want us to improve. They can be a bit too strict at times, but overall they are good teachers.\n\nMost of the students are nice. Some students are quite toxic though.\n\nThe facilities are really nice, and the canteen food is very good!!\nThe food is so good, only when I left primary school then I truly appreciated the deliciousness of the food in Rosyth. Canteen stall owners are also really nice, once I was ten cents short, and they still let me have the food.\n\nThe only thing that is bad is the new princiap, he dosent really care about the students and teachers well being, and cancelled most of the post psle activities for the P6 cohort. I wish the old principal could have stayed.\n\nOverall great school, just the new principal is bad.",

      "text": "Refuse to answer much, but I think that the approach to the discipline is slightly.. odd, to say the least. The principal had accused my younger brother of ‘hiding behind his defences’, such because although he had done some disrespect to staff, the principal apparently threatened him with severe punishments, note, he is also diagnosed with mild autism, and although he is in the wrong, he requires more gentle guidance, not mindless shouting!\nI see why, but he has a record of doing this before, because he is oppressed at home by my parents. They normally favour me over my brother, being the latter, which is in P6. So a summary, sibling had done wrong, slightly too extreme of a punishment, being a suspension, and he confessed to me, that he wanted to kill himself.",
