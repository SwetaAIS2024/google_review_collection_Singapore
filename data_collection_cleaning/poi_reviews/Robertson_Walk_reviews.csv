Cristian Zaharia,5,"Cozy, quiet, pubs & restaurants offer wide choices of dishes from Asian to Australian, from Arabic to Italian. Fully animated especially evenings, weekends pretty crowdy.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114792054925871659838/reviews
Tyler Dixon,4,"Very nice plaza by the river. It's a great place for a morning walk for the introvert and a great place for an extrovert in the evening. I like the little bridges for crossing over. Surrounded by a small park, there are lots of options for food and shopping. The area is well kept and seems to be quite popular. Restaurant options are quite varied, slightly upscale but still plenty casual. It appears they may have some boat tour launches from this area. I didn't see any while I was walking.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105739268163530272339/reviews
Shyvonne Lee,5,"Lovely place to walk. Lots of restaurants, shops and bars. Many take their dogs along for a walk and drink too! Such a nice place to just chill and relax and watch football.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113150403194920688585/reviews
Wee San Low,5,"Surrounded by many condominiums, the place is filled with many eateries of all kind. Price point is therefore of restaurant kind but the food are usually pretty good. As the whole place is built around the Singapore river, the ambient is quite surreal and nice. This is especially when night falls, when the surrounding are lighted up and even the bridges are with colours. A good place for couples and social gathering.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104193174503991545162/reviews
