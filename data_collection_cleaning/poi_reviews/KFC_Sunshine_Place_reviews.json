So disturbing. I am so annoyed, cant even eat in peace. The management should look into staff behaviour and also how they act when representing the company in uniform. It is my first time here and I definitely would not want to patron here anymore.",

Chicken was only okay, abit tasteless and does not ‘hit’ like the other outlets, even though it was pretty hot when served. Ordered the new Zinger but it didn’t look like the one in the poster too, and poorly put together. However, portions at this outlet is pretty good. This outlet could definitely improve in terms of quality of food.",
