      "text": "Not so special. 1) The balsamic glaze was not enough on the pizza so it didn’t taste much flavor but instead was kinda dry. 2) Pizza got burnt on certain spots. I saw the pizza on the other table was also burnt so I guess it’s normal? 3)I’m not a fan of using chipped plate. 4) the crab meat pasta was fishy. We asked the waiter for suggestion on the mains and he recommended this dish. Later on we saw this dish was on every table. The waiter suggested the same to everyone…. Rating: 6/10",

My friend even got a birthday card that contains well wishes from the team - say what?!\n\nAnyways I had such a wonderful time here and forgot what I ordered. The most memorable was the roasted pumpkin with like amazing nuts. It’s charred, tender and has nice crunch.\n\nOh anyways, GRAB their tiramisu! It’s amazing.",

Al dente and standout were the vongole, ravioli and sausage. Calamari was so so.\n\nOnly thing is they do not offer bread basket.\n\nPlace is quite small as well and food is slightly pricier with per dish averaging $30.",

The Burratina is fresh and good. When to many Italian restaurant, this is one of the best. Vongole pasta, they use very fresh clams. Better to book in advance. Seat indoor, out is a bit hot for Singapore weather. At this time, the street outside is quite happening.",
