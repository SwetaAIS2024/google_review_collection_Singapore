Menu contains a good range of mala xiang guo, boiled fish, meats, vegetables, cold dishes, skewers, noodles, and rice. The beef skewers were too tough and dry, while pork skewers are better, as some fat slices are used. I enjoyed the laziji and mushroom with cucumbers.",

We loved everything we ordered (steamed okras, smoky potatoes dry pot, mala tofu and the fish in pickled mustard soup). Massive kudos for how vegan/ vegetarian friendly the place is (the staff is helpful in making slight customizations in our food). The restaurant isn't so big but clean and bright. We'll be back!",
