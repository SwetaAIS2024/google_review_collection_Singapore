Basil Phang,5,"I previously did my Basic Open Water Course with them and it was phenomenal- I never regretted taking the course with this dive company.

Recently in November, I again did the Dive Against Debris course with them where the instructor was Ying Kai, and they had once again delivered with a  fantastic experience. I would definitely recommend this dive company to anyone that is looking for a enjoyable and smooth sailing experience in anything underwater! =)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103579931956860788521/reviews
CT,5,"I had a fantastic experience at The Submersibles! Ying Kai provided excellent recommendations on scuba gear, helping me choose the right equipment based on my needs. He truly went above and beyond, assisting me in getting and fixing up my regulator and dive computer just in time for my trip. His expertise and dedication ensured everything was in perfect condition, giving me peace of mind before my dives. I really appreciate his professionalism and willingness to go the extra mile. Highly recommend him and his shop for anyone looking for quality dive gear and top-notch service!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113851029513713295916/reviews
Chew Keet Fai,5,"Just completed my AOWD with the Submersibles. I am known to be a non talented person, but thanks to instructor Felix, I achieved peak performance bouyancy in just 5 dives in Bintan.

Kavita Devi,5,"I signed up for the Submersibles' Dive Against Debris course this year. It was impeccably organised and thorough. The training dives were off Lazarus island, and the DMs (Jonas, a DM in training and Felix) were professional and attentive. They did an excellent job explaining the Dos and Don'ts of debris retrieval, and also ensured our safety in the silty conditions of Singapore waters. I have previously also been on diving trips as a solo diver organised by this company and they've always been very good value for money !",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107933591302195173431/reviews
