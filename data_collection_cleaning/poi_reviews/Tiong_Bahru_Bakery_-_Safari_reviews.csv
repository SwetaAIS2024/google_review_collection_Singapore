steven lim,4,"Quite a charming place.  We popped in for some pastries and coffee after having lunch next door.

Service was friendly and quick, and I had the usual almond croissant, which was tasty.

Best to try this place while you can cause understand it may close by the end of the year.

Parking is a lottery though.  The lots are usually full but it seems not with customers‚Äô cars as we saw several people parking and then walking towards Botanical Gardens.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117434407303387249783/reviews
Ian Leader,4,"It‚Äôs less safari and more ‚ÄúI had a farm in Africa‚Ä¶‚Äù with chickens running around (it‚Äôs connected to a community farm after all) but the slightly weird decor (longhorn skull ? on the wall) doesn‚Äôt really detract from the outdoor seating which is spacious, shaded and well ventilated with fans. Espresso was good and the chocolate almonds croissant (warmed up üëç) was superb. The seating is a little confusing (pick a table first - but there‚Äôs no obvious way to reserve it if you‚Äôre alone. Singapore is safe, but I still don‚Äôt want to leave my stuff sitting there unattended to hold the table while I order‚Ä¶)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113473223168033189021/reviews
Zackery Goh,5,"Tiong Bahru Bakery in Dempsey is an absolute gem! The safari-themed decor adds a unique and vibrant atmosphere that makes every visit feel like an adventure. The playful touches, like jungle-inspired artwork and lush greenery, create a delightful backdrop for enjoying delicious food.

The pastries are nothing short of amazing! From their flaky croissants to the rich, decadent tarts, every bite is a treat. I particularly loved their signature Kouign Amann‚Äîit's perfectly crispy on the outside and wonderfully buttery on the inside.

The staff is friendly and attentive, making sure you feel welcome and well taken care of. Whether you're grabbing a quick coffee or settling in for a leisurely brunch, the ambiance is perfect for any occasion.

Overall, Tiong Bahru Bakery in Dempsey is a must-visit. The combination of delicious food and a fun safari theme makes it a standout spot for anyone looking to indulge in a delightful culinary experience!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109405400403426765330/reviews
c tzehow,4,"Found this place when around Dempsey. Very unique and relaxing on 3pm evening. Not crowded but many bread items were sold out. Many car park available...if looking for chill, with free car park, this is one place to consider. Staff is friendly too.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102842308844590273724/reviews
D N,3,"Not really pet friendly. Sit outside but unable to order food as no QR ordering. Glad the manager help by suggesting me to order for self pickup and they self it to me.

Ps. No one place their dog alone unattended. May it be big or small. Coming as a couple is fine. Not alone with pets

Thanks for offer of my contact. Appreciate for email back. If QR ordering and inside seating can be implemented soon.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110874093528908991511/reviews
