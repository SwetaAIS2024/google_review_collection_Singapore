      "text": "Mizuma Gallery, nestled in the peaceful Gillman Barracks, is a must-visit for those interested in East and Southeast Asian contemporary art. Established in 2012, the gallery excels at promoting talented Southeast Asian artists while also featuring renowned East Asian figures such as Ai Weiwei. Currently, the exhibition *Epigraphic Landscape of Balinese Painting* by Kemalezedine is on display, offering a deep dive into Balinese art. Despite its excellent shows, the gallery sees very few visitors, making it an ideal space for quiet, immersive viewing. Highly recommended for its strong curation and serene location.",

Interesting art pieces and displays, a bit creepy too. This is only a small gallery explorable in 15 to 30 minutes. I'm not sure if they do sell figurines, but I saw in the photo some art pieces with tags beside them.",
