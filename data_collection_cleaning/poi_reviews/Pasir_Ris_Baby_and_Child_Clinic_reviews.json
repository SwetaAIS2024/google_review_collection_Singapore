The staff are friendly and helpful, and Dr. Chia is excellent—she really takes the time to listen to your concerns and offers helpful advice and reassurance for parents. You can tell she genuinely cares.\n\nThe only downside is that there isn’t a proper baby changing room or corner, which would’ve been helpful. Also, the waiting time can be a bit long, so I’d recommend booking your appointment online in advance to avoid the wait.\n\nOverall, a great clinic with caring staff and a great doctor!",

She takes the time to explain everything clearly and always makes me feel at ease during appointments. Her receptionist is equally fantastic—warm, attentive and welcoming. They help make every visit stress-free! We’re so grateful to have found such a wonderful team near our place!",

Can feel that she is sincere in attending to him and can see that she is trying to connect with my 3yo son to feel comfortable and ease. I like the way she approaches and will visit the clinic again if there’s a need. The price is reasonable. Comparing with the quality and service provided, my opinion is really worth it. The ambience is very cosy for the kids and adults. Both receptionist are friendly and willing to listen as well. Overall, really a thumbs up for everything- doctor, receptionist and environment. Parking is also convenient, sheltered all the way should it be a rainy weather.",

      "text": "I had previously visited two GPs and a polyclinic before seeing Dr. Moira, and each time I was told that my child had a viral fever, despite my concerns about her labored breathing and use of accessory muscles. When we visited Dr. Moira, she listened carefully and diagnosed my child with pneumonia. I am incredibly grateful for her expertise.\n\nThe entire experience at Dr. Moira’s clinic has been pleasant. We had even come for a vaccine before, and each visit has been a positive experience. Dr. Moira listens attentively and interacts warmly with my child, making the visits easier even when she’s cranky. The nurses and clinic staff are also kind and friendly. I highly recommend Dr. Moira and her team!",
