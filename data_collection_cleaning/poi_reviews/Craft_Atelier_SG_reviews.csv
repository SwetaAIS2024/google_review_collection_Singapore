N Jansen Calamita,5,"We did the book binding class. It was both fun and educational. Our teacher was AMAZING. We left knowing we could do it gain on our own because we now understood the purpose of each step. Absolutely amazing “vibe” — relaxed, friendly and accepting. We will go back for more classes. Also great fiber supplies — we bought some sashiko supplies and our teacher explained how to get started!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103985530404940965445/reviews
