The portion is super big for ladies, cannot finish in one sitting. Will return to try their sandwiches.",

Her response was \"you can just eat it from the bag\". My partner and I were already seated with an earlier order of drinks and a slice of cake so this wasn't for takeaway.",

      "text": "Cedele shouldn’t be getting scores like this. They’ve been around for some time and their food is always spot on or at least not far from it.\n\nThe place here just feels really dodgy with the poor yellow lighting. Just doesn’t feel well illuminated. It’s not romantic, it feels dingy.\n\nThe service is poor due to the lack of staff, a problem which is crippling much of the F&B industry so, I can understand to a certain extent.\n\nWhat bothered me was this - i ordered a cup of English breakfast tea and I requested for a small cup of milk to go along. I’m one of the many whom drink my English Breakfast with some milk, just to help smoothen and make the texture of the drink creamy and nice. Just like how you’d drink earl grey with lemon to make it taste a little more wholesome.\n\nTo my dismay, they told me they need to charge me for a dash of milk. What?\n\nI mean come on, the cup is already small enough.\n\nJust as a passing comment out of frustration, I told the lady who drinks English breakfast without even a dash of milk? She said yes there are.\n\nOh well.",
