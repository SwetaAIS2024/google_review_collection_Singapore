She kept rolling her eyes whilst i talk to her, I dont frequently buy thus not sure the terms of how to buy and she wasn't helpful at all, just chased all the luck away. A suggestion , This Is a place where people need luck, if you are that unhappy with your own life, stop working there spreading your negativity chasing the luck away for everyone seriously!",
