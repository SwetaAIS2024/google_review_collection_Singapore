So try to be early or later. Quite big with ample seatings. If you are feeling warm, can head to the individual western stalk that has its own air condition seating. Of cos only western food allowed. No very ex. Slightly more than typical coffeeshop western prices.",

Safe distancing measures still in place, so some places marked \"x\" the diner cannot sit there.\n\nSurprising crowded. Now has lesser place to seat due to social distancing measures. Do expect it to get more crowded with more people returning to work at the workplace. Food is still good.",
