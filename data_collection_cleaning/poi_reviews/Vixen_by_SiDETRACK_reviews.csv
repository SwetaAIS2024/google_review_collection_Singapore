Corinna C,5,"Went back to Sidetrack today and was equally pleased with my lunch today - Beef Shakshuka rice bowl.
Beef was tender and very flavour and the portion was generous.

Was there 2 weeks ago and the baked potato that came with the ribeye steak was just as fantastic as the first time.

A month ago...
My family had a very satisfying lunch with our order of 2 ribeye steaks, 1 fish & chips and 1 lamb shank. The baked potato was SO good. The fish used is pollock. No GST and service charge! Will definitely re-visit this eatery.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117834198747119723770/reviews
Q Loh,2,"What I got and what I received was different from what was written in the menu. I ordered a chicken roulade which is supposed to be stuffed with spinach with potato salad and greens. But I got a chicken thigh stuffed with celery and fries instead of potato salad. Would appreciate if I was informed that the potato salad is changed to fries and the chicken thigh is stuffed with celery instead of spinach. Their service isn’t that good as well as when I were still browsing at the drinks menu, the waiter just grab the menu back from us without asking if we are done looking at the menu.

When settling the bill their card machine isn’t working so had to pay with cash instead. For those who are intending to go will be good to carry cash in case their card machine isn’t working again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116616810560187756900/reviews

Antoine Cao,1,"5 of us came for dinner and we ordered 5 main courses.
Only 1 of the 5 dishes arrived, we thought the rest was still in preparation.
After 30 min, we asked them if the food was coming soon.
But they forgot to key in the remaining orders and told us the kitchen was closed.
Apparently, It didn’t seem weird to them that 4 of us was watching one person eating…
On top of that, the only dish we had tasted like reheat food.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112156621239849547065/reviews
