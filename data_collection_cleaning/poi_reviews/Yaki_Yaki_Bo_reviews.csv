Caleb Tan,4,"Small teppanyaki restaurant in the Japan food street. We got seats in front of the chef and the kids were excited to see the chef cook for us (but also afraid that the oil will splatter on them)

Food was decent but full of garlic. The garlic fried rice was very delicious. There was also free appetizer (cabbage with garlic sauce). Came out of the restaurant smelling like garlic.

Spent $100 for 4 pax.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113662045918405903382/reviews
Sandy Shum,5,"My go-to spot for teppanyaki. I love their garlic fried rice—it’s a must-have. The menu offers a wide variety of meats and seafood, all of which pair perfectly with the garlicky bean sprouts. The crème brûlée with green tea cream was a delightful finish!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106380917396877023232/reviews
Ken Tan,5,"Delicious teppanyaki lunch set meal @ $14.90 consisting of (tried chicken and white fish options), bean sprouts, salad, pickles, miso soup.  Current promo they also add a cup of free steam egg. Upgraded to garlic fried rice which tasted  great. Overall good value and taste as the dishes were freshly prepared.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100121205735734303463/reviews
Belle Bells,5,"The teppanyaki sliced pork and beef set was fantastic. The meats were tender and flavorful, and the garlic rice was perfectly fragrant and tasty. The fresh salad and warm soup balanced the meal nicely, and the scoop of ice cream was a sweet, refreshing finish. A simple, satisfying meal!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107847679499670277928/reviews
inwardsheelflip,1,"I don't normally post bad reviews but I was utterly disappointed by the lack of quality control at the Jurong Point outlet compared to the NEX outlet.

We ordered 2 sets of the sliced beef with garlic fried rice, and the beef arrived overcooked, tough and dry. This is the probably the worst teppanyaki I've had, even compared to those at food courts. The garlic rice that came with the sets were also atrocious - completely lacking in flavour of any kind, almost like having plain rice with bits of fried garlic.

The sliced pork was marginally better but was still slightly overcooked and dry.

The best part of the meal was the slushy that came free at the end of the meal.

I find it inexcusable to be serving food of this standard, especially when it's improperly cooked and not a matter of subjective taste.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106042350645724955534/reviews
