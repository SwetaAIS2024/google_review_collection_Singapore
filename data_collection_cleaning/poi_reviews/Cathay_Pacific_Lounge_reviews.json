The highlight of the lounge is definitely the famous Noodle Bar üçú, where you can enjoy freshly made Wonton Noodles, authentic Laksa, and even Hainanese Chicken Rice üçó‚Äîevery dish is top-notch! The buffet offers a wide variety of desserts, beverages, and premium champagne, including MO√ãT & CHANDON ü•Ç, making the whole experience even more luxurious.\n\nThis marks the end of my Singapore trip and the beginning of my next adventure in Bangkok! My goal for the next four years has never been clearer! üöÄüî•",

The live station with their signature wanton noodles plus local favourite- laksa was good. The laksa even tasted better than the ones at SIA lounges in my ‚Äòtaste‚Äô. Champagne wise was Moet brut which was also good.\n\nService was good too, one senior uncle very polite and always smiling, greeting guests.",
