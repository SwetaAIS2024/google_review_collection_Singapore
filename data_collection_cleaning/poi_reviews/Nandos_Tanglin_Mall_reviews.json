      "text": "Have not tried Nando’s for quite awhile so I was pleasantly surprised when we dined at the Tanglin Mall the other night. The food tasted nice and the portion was decent. I really enjoyed the chicken thigh on skewers- the chicken was nicely done, the rice was fragrant and the accompanying veggies added to the oomph.  My companions also had good things to say about their orders. The place was not overly crowded on a Friday night.",

      "text": "If you crave a citrus tang and spicy kick, Nando's delivers and then some.\n\nAnd if like me, you love chicken liver, Nando's actually serves up an addictive rendition of sauteed chicken liver in a zingy, spicy sauce. Damn, it's da bomb!\n\nThose creamy chicken livers swim in a moreish tangy gravy and on our recent visit, ended up being the most enjoyable dish.\n\nOur chicken thighs were alright, standard Nando's affair, juicy and tender but I personally like a greasy fried chicken. I might give their wings a spin the next time I head back for my liver-fix.\n\nNow, if Nando's had margheritas, they'd be perfect!",
