      "text": "Today, Kitty and I joined the Brompton World Travellers for a night ride. Our mission tonight was to conquer one of the roti prata stores at Tampines. One of the members had mentioned it was some of the best curry he'd ever had, and we were both craving it.\n\nThe ride was arranged specifically for this purpose, and we arrived at Sultan Curry, which is situated below an HDB block. It's a very simple stall, not very big, and the renovation is simple.\n\nKitty and I had already eaten dinner, so we just wanted to try out the roti prata to see if it was really as good as everyone said. We decided to order the white mee goreng without tomato sauce and a roti prata with egg, based on the recommendations from the other members.\n\nThe curry was okay, but the prata, sadly, wasn't fantastic. The mee goreng was also just okay. The member who said the prata was amazing seemed disappointed. Maybe it was because we were a large group and the kitchen was overwhelmed. It seemed like they were struggling to keep up.\n\nThe staff were trying their best, but they were rushed and ended up giving a few wrong orders to some of the cyclists.  Despite this, they were trying to provide excellent service.\n\nConsidering the ambiance, service, and the food, we gave Sultan Curry 3 stars, mainly for the food.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't exactly the culinary experience we were hoping for.",

      "text": "A Night Ride for Roti Prata: Sultan Curry, Tampines\n\nTonight, Donkey and I joined the Brompton World Travellers on a special mission: to conquer one of Tampines' legendary roti prata stalls.  Fueled by the promise of incredible curry, we set off on a night ride, arriving at Sultan Curry, a humble stall tucked beneath an HDB block.\n\nSimple Setting, Mixed Expectations:\n\nThe stall itself is unassuming, small, and simply renovated.  We, having already eaten dinner, were eager to sample the famed roti prata and see if it lived up to the hype.  Following recommendations from fellow cyclists, we ordered the white mee goreng (without tomato sauce) and a roti prata with egg.\n\nA Culinary Disappointment:\n\nThe curry was decent, but the prata, unfortunately, fell short of our expectations.  The mee goreng was also just okay.  The member who had raved about the prata seemed disappointed, and we couldn't help but wonder if the large group had overwhelmed the kitchen, leading to a less-than-stellar experience.\n\nRushed Service, Good Intentions:\n\nThe staff, though rushed and occasionally making mistakes with orders, were clearly trying their best to provide excellent service.  Despite the occasional hiccup, their dedication was evident.\n\nA 3-Star Verdict:\n\nConsidering the ambiance, service, and food, we awarded Sultan Curry 3 stars, primarily for the decent curry.  While the food wasn't bad, it wasn't the culinary masterpiece we had hoped for.  Perhaps our high expectations, fueled by the enthusiastic recommendations, contributed to the disappointment.",

      "text": "Decided to try this new Indian Muslim food store at my neighbourhood. The dishes on the menu looked great and prices were reasonable and cheaper than other similar eateries in Tampines. Ordered the Maggi Goreng Mutton and Butter Chicken with Rice. Dishes were cooked well with decent portion sizes and butter chicken sauce was nicely done with. Would recommend that the noodles could be a little less \"wet\" and the butter chicken would be better if a little warmer. However, overall this is a good comfort food after work and a nice chill place to hang out with family and friends. The place was still quiet but hopefully there'll be more customers soon. üëç (Also: hopefully they'll replace the awning outside their store with a clear and recognisable sign/logo as they're still using the previous eatery's, so more people will notice the store)\n\nUpdate: looks like they've got themselves a new awning! üëçüëç",
