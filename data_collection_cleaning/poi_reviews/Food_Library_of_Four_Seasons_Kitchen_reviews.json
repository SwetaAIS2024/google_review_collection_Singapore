      "text": "1st time trying this. They have a huge selection and today I tried the sirloin. Since it was new to me I didn't dare try medium but opted for medium well. Turned out well done, which may not be a bad thing. Taste is frankly quite average but at least it wasn't overly chewy or tough to bite. Quite a generous portion as well including both fries and mashed potatoes. For $13 it's good value for $ to get your macros in.",

Mushroom sauce was pretty strong and flavorful.  Mash potato a bit dry but sauce is good. Grilled chicken was a bit dry and slightly overcooked.\n\noverall pretty normal.",
