Terence Oh,1,"I have never seen a roast duck stall say they're out of duck at 12:30PM when I try to order half a duck. Especially when there are two hanging from the hooks.  They probably have such low turnover that they do not have a steady supply, or the duck is no longer roasted on site as it used to be. Whatever the case, there is no good reason to come here when there are so many good roast meat stalls around.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100930612192424734569/reviews

The Hordes,1,"I've always come here to eat, the food is good but however I felt racism against me when I'm eating here. Notice that other people get more char siew than I am all the time. I always assumed that other people bought extra, but when my friend went to buy while I waited at the table, he got more than what I had.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106972864948447840700/reviews
