T KX,3,"We were looking forward to the meal due to the good reviews but were disappointed üòî

Firstly, the restaurant seems short-staffed as the place was packed but with only one or two staff at the front, hence the food and drinks took awhile.

Secondly, although I enjoyed the loaded nachos, the tacos were mid‚Ä¶ although the fried fish was great, the pulled pork was pretty tough and the tacos in general were super dry‚Ä¶ wished there were more sauces in the taco or provided at the table. The braised beef quesadilla ($16, not pictured) was alright.

There were 3 of us and we had 1 nachos, 2 sets of tacos, 1 quesadilla to share. We were still pretty hungry (but didn‚Äôt order more because we didn‚Äôt really enjoyed the food)  and paid $21.30 per pax, hence I felt that the cost was pretty steep.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113509406195710292628/reviews

loaded nachos - $12
sibarita‚Äôs pork chopper - $16
wild mushroom quesadilla - $15

the fish taco and mushroom quesadilla were the best!! the crispy battered fish was so moist and flavourful! the mushroom quesadilla was packed with cheese and so much mushrooms!

ended the meal off with their churros and it was served piping hot, best was the chocolate dip!!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108634319642099700166/reviews
Zy Tan,2,"Slightly disappointing considering the good reviews. The food is decent but it's quite pricey and the portion size is small.
My order for 3 items + a drink came up to ~$50 and i wasn't anywhere filled. Note 10% service charge applies.
Barramundi taco was nicely done and the best of the 3.
Pulled pork quesadilla was lacking in taste which is unfortunate, since it looked like quite a bit of effort went into it.
The nachos looked sad when they came up cos they were around the same size as my hand - and my hands aren't huge. The salsa was nice though. Wish the portion was more generous.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111980790781970783722/reviews
Vic.A.,5,"Broccoli platter tastes like loklok (i mean i like it). The pork collar is a weeeeee bit tough, love their fries though. The colesalw veers towards the saltier taste The mushroom quesadilla was tooooo salty that day.

Thier crowning glory: the barramundi tacos. MUST try! Super tender and goes very well with the sauce.
This is my 2nd visit for their barramundi tacos. Would go back again to try their other foodsüëç",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117007779505118476977/reviews
Weimin Ong,5,"Cosy place with no crowd on a Sunday afternoon. Prices are affordable. Ordered a pasta marinara ($15), churros ($6), chicken quesadilla ($14) and beef sandwich. Also had a shirley temple for $7. Everything tasted pretty authentic and the pasta was cooked al dente. Would definitely recommend for anyone with a craving!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106180724988450175797/reviews
