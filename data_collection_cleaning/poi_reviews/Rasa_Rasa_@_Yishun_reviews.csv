H Y,2,"Ordered sambal beef fried rice, but some of the beef was tough. The paprik sliced fish was even worse, with only 10% fish and the rest being thick fried flour. Be cautious when ordering this dish.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108524532085291935025/reviews

emerald manoj,2,"This is a Halal certified restaurant with a Huge menu ... if you happen to be a Vegan/Vegetarian this might not be suitable place We finished a little stroll around the Yishun Park and thought we'll drop by for a little snack but couldnt find quick bites ... so went in for a small meal instead...
The place was super crowded but surprisingly not chaotic ... there were large groups of people and family dining which gave us the impression of a worthy restaurant ... we order fries, tempura prawns , kampong prawn Nasi Goreng , BBQ soto , watermelon juice, grass jelly soy milk.. The service seemed quick for the large crowd and the staffs seemed really polite , there were two robot that served some dishes once in a while and it was quote a sight ... The food didn't hit though , It was extremely greasy and also a little on the saltier side ... we felt a little uneasy after the dinner ...",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116697614667332134047/reviews

Nur Iqlimah,3,"3 dishes:
Rice with sambal fish
Seafood Tomyam Pasta
Ebi Fry (fried prawn with fries)
Teh Halia (ginger tea)
Mango Milkshake

Sambal fish wasn't that nice because the prawn paste (sambal belacan) taste was overwhelming...it doesn't taste like normal sambal..more of prawn paste sambal..

Tomyam pasta was too creamy and sour....I usually prefer no cream base and at least spicier, less sour type..portion was perfect though..

Ebi Fry was perfectly nice. I think so far the best meal would be this..

Mango Milkshake was nice, teh Halia is not so gingery...lack of ginger..

If I'm around the area, then I will drop by again if not, I don't think I will specifically come here for a meal..",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112154388875110526113/reviews
