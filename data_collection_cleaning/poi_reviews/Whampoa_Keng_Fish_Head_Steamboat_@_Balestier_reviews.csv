Shirling Ang,5,The only place for Fish hotpot! The flavorful broth is refillable. The cze char dishes are of a high standard and consistently good and the price is reasonable. Truly my neighborhood gem! I would suggest to make a reservation as they can get busy especially weekends and rainy days!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102289071269532669845/reviews
Furlisia,4,"Came here on Motherâ€™s day and had no option but to go with the package. The fish steamboat is pretty decent albeit I donâ€™t fancy the milk in it. Love the truffle crackers! The other dishes were pretty great, except for the chestnut pork belly which is kinda too jelat for my familyâ€™s liking.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110106623533609724463/reviews
Jowe Chu,5,"Iâ€™ve visited many times but have never reviewed this restaurant. Iâ€™ll give it justice thjs time ðŸ˜„

Ordered the small grouper steamboat. Came with a generous serving of fresh fish, yam, veg and delicious soup. The fish roe came separate, crunchy and fresh. Dip everything into the delicious garlic chili sauce ðŸ˜‹

We also had the prawn paste chicken. Itâ€™s alright but not great.

Beer is a must!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103686986101125387388/reviews
Kris Lee,4,"Craving for a hearty and flavorful steamboat experience? Whampoa Keng's fish head steamboat here is a must-try. The fish is always incredibly fresh, and the thick, savory soup adds so much depth to each bite. The prawn rolls are a standout â€“ consistently yummy, packed with flavor. As for the cereal prawns, while they're decent, they don't quite compare to the other dishes. Iâ€™ve brought many of my overseas friends here, and every time, they leave satisfied. Even my daughter loves the steamboat, making it a perfect spot for family meals. It's always a delight!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101410568054850759330/reviews
