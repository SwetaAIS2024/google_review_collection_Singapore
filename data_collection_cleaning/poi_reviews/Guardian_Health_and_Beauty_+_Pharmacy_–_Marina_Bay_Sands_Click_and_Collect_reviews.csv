Kristy Chong Mis,5,"Surprised by the service experience, thought I was in LV for a moment. Even LV sometimes couldnâ€™t provide such a nice standard of service.

Went there to buy heatpack, the sales advisor approach me and show empathy to my situation. MS Wang Hong Xia even offer me oil and cream massage to help me relief my pain. Unfortunately Iâ€™m currently under doctor treatment so didnâ€™t purchase the cream from there. She definitely not hard sell or what, she donâ€™t even try to sell me and I can feel the cares and love from her. In case I got her name wrong, sheâ€™s a short hair with braces sales advisor.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106047827071025509901/reviews

Rin Sakuma,1,"I met a very rude shop assistant, she asked me what I wanted. After I told her, she recommended an expensive one with a small quantity, saying that two people could use it for one year. I didn't feel like a good deal, so I showed her a picture of the specific item I was looking for, and she became very rude, saying that the one I showed her was a Chinese brand with bad materials, and that they wouldn't sell such bad stuff in their store. But what's interesting is that this is a British brand, and this person's Chinese accent is obviously not a Singapore native, most like a person who comes from China, but despise her own country. I think first of all, she was unprofessional, she didn't know which country the brand was from, second, her attitude was very bad, I have never encountered such a rude shop assistant, and finally her words were obviously racist, which made me uncomfortable. Singapore is a country with great racial integration, and it is unacceptable for such a shop assistant  to work in the store at Marina Bay Sands.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114246847260642439521/reviews
