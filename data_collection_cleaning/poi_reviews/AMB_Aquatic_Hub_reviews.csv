Ying,1,"Totally feel cheated.
$39.80 for this and I searched online at 2 different shops for $17.50 or $15 .
I understand that u are located at orchard and need to pay rent but seriously , more than 50% increase of price ?!!! This is like robbing.
And the item has no price tag .
NEVER EVER BUY FROM THIS SHOP. Unless you like to be “robbed”.

Ritchie Ong,1,"Very Poor attitude and arrogant

because shop owner said that my terrapin bought from other shop is lousy and his one cost more than 4 times the cost of mine, i think he seriously no EQ

he claim that his one is superior because is imported from Taiwan therefore more intelligent and lively which is very insensitive and hard tell whether is true or not, how do you even measure terrapin intelligence?

Please do not patronise his shop, extremely rude and arrogant",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110950264266640491032/reviews

Nawal Kishor,5,"I was there last week and was served by a lady . She was very knowledgeable and managed to provide answers my enquiries .
Although things here are generally pricier being in Orchard area , I still bought  some stuff because I have not seen them at my regular shops.
Also the best part is that this place only stocks freshwater fish so you are assured that you are not buying the wrong fish . I was also impressed by the range of small and medium- sized  fish .",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105095477431082223011/reviews
Gary Heng,1,This shop should not be situated in Centrepoint. I believe their locality is the reason for their sky high prices. They are quite well stock but nothing compared to the usual aquariums you find in hdb estates,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108871436805796141949/reviews
