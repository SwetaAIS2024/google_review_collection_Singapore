Lixin Foo,5,"Dr Queck is pleasant and thorough in his explanations and treatment recommendations. He is also bilingually fluent (Eng & Chi), which is a big help for inter-generational consultations. Thank you to the front desk as well for squeezing the last-minute appointment in without having to do any waiting.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102272389399580596525/reviews
Lihan Zhang,1,"Dr Queck appears to be a nice and patient doctor. However, he has given us a lot of wrong information and misdiagnosis.

Although MRI scan showed some issues with her brain but he did not pursue to investigate what was causing the white matter and the seizure. He even gave me wrong information about my mum’s seizure attack. Kept saying that when my mum has laboured breathing and drooling, it was a seizure aura. I was doubtful about his diagnosis as I could not find any information on it. Only when I managed to take a video after 6mths and showed to him, he said it was a seizure attack. To be frank, I lost trust in him but he is so good with the old folk, my mum refused to get a second opinion. As I didn’t want to anger her further, as it may trigger her seizure, I did not pursue.

My mum’s condition worsened for the past few months despite him increasing the dosage. When I asked him if taking her blood to test or redoing the MRI scan, he insisted not necessary.

I managed to convince my mum to seek 2nd opinion as I shared with her the severity and how much stress it has been causing me. I was on the verge of depression as I was so sleep deprived and exhausted. I asked about food to avoid, he said “No” but the hospital actually gave me a whole list of food with reference to a research studies. I never felt supported as a caregiver under Dr Queck’s consultation as he would just dismiss me about possibility of my mum having sleep apnea or blood pressure issues etc… (her seizures are always nocturnal)

He also said that my mum has Parkinsondism and not the disease. 2 senior consultants from NNI TTSH checked and said she didn’t but she has white matter disease (a new term I came to know about).

I would strongly advise patients to be cautious and do seek 2nd opinion. I am writing this with kind intention as I hope that similar cases like my mum would not happen again. It was a traumatic experience for me as dealing with her illness is alright but dealing with her emotions is the major stressor without the support of the doctor.

My mum is in the care of NNI-TTSH now. We are thankful that we met a very dedicated team and doctor and I am more at ease.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117793330628546021109/reviews

Stacey,5,"Dr. Queck is professional, patient, easy to talk with, compassionate and thoroughly knowledgeable. Was referred to him a year back by the A&E dept of Mount Alvernia for migraines that won't go away and from the first appointment to a now open appointment, he's been every bit the excellent specialist he is in his field.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103356544529951875292/reviews
Benjamin Koh,5,"Dr Queck is a patient and kind doctor, who listens attentively to his patients and is also very accommodating. He spends extra time to attend to patients with more needs so as to give them the best care. Do not listen to those who cannot wait just because Dr Queck is doing his job. And the receptionist is a super friendly guy who is always helpful and serves with a great smile. A big thumbs up!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114101071678918471504/reviews
