      "text": "Visited this place on Wednesday 20 Nov. Glad to learn that they are back @ Mandarin Gardens, w new items on the menu too. We ordered our usual favourites. Love the wet horfun, has the fried wok hei Chao tar taste. My family loved the dry horfun. Other dishes to try is the cereal chicken (can add more cereal will be nicer), the butter chicken & broccoli. Food came fast, staff were efficient & attentive. Aunty Karen even came over to our table to ensure everything was good. Will definitely keep coming back like last time!",

Was sneezing due to the spices and staff caught on and gave me more tissues unprompted.\n\nAtmosphere isn‚Äôt the best as it usually crowded and noisy but nothing you can do about it.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you are driving, or living in the area. Otherwise nothing that special to travel down for I guess.",
