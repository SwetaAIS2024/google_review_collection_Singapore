Am really pleased with the staff (hope your little finger recover soon!).\n\nWe ordered scallop mentaiko pasta, clam pasta, banger and mash,  beef burger and mealtime beer. All the food including the beer are nice!! My two young daughters had the scallop mentaiko and clam pasta and they were liked it so much.\n\nEnvironment wise, it‚Äôs a causal place so would be great for drinks and catch up with friends. . High chair and table hence it wasn‚Äôt every comfortable to sit on and may not be suitable for kids younger than 3 (including those who can‚Äôt sit still). Would have given it 5 star if there are comfortable table and chairs. :)",

      "text": "I guess the non vegan dishes should be good. Why I gave 1 star for food is I ordered a vegan dish as I'm a vegetarian but was served with chunks of beef flakes. Even after verifying with staff I was assured it's Vegan. I finished the food and was later told by the waiter there was actually meat pieces. The boss was very apologetic but it should not happened and can be harmful to people with certain allergies.\n\n4 Oct - No worries. It was just an honest mistake. While the dish i had was not vegan but I would give a 4 star if I wasn't a vegetarian. It actually tasted quite good. I would recommend to try Chug Chug and quite cosy too.",
