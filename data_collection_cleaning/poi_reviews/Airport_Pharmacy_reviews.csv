Albert Teo,1,"Was told only pharmacist available at T4. At store, there is dispensary but no sign of pharmacist.  No clear time pharmacist went on break or when they are coming back. Store clerk gave a random time that is longer than usual hour breaks and when I pointed it out hurried to try to make an excuse. Issue isn’t that pharmacist went on break, rather no clear timing when they will be gone/back and staff trying to cover.

Do not expect to get medications from this pharmacy. Have bought medications from other terminals before and much better experience.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113254392536075322747/reviews
Janice Lua,5,"I got my husband to buy some medicated oil from T4 Pharmacy for my colleague mom as my colleague showed me a video that she wanted for her mom due to muscle aches. My hubby said the male Vietnamese staff from this video recommended various pain solutions and my hubby purchased the best there is in the shop.
This staff is definitely an asset to the shop as my hubby said the Vietnamese boy made the video on his own to promote the store. Apparently he is a Vietnamese influencer.
Unfortunately my hubby never got to thank this boy. We hope the Changi Airport helps to relay the message that my colleague mom is very pleased with the product recommendation.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114853969427072935829/reviews
Tim,5,Had a wonderful experience with the staff after discovering they spoke Vietnamese.  They were able to find and recommend products to bring back to Vietnam for my mother-in-law.  Really made for a memorable shopping trip.  Thanks for your help!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105690298835694675568/reviews
Soil&Sprouts Singapore,1,"Asked for a particular drug and got directed to the other store belonging to the same company. Then the other 'pharmacist' claimed that they don't have and why should I have listened to the 'cashier' from the other store. Honestly as a customer, I only need to find what I need and how do I know how u guys segregate ur duties",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101379151988325125602/reviews
