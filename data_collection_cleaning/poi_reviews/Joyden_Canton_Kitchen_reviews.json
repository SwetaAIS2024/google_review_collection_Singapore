      "text": "First impressions are very important and sadly Joyden’s staff, Paul, failed to make a good first impression. When I asked him for recommendations, it’s like “Just look at the top 10 lor” kind of attitude. He just strode off and didn’t even linger around to recommend their dishes. No smiles, no passions, no pride of dishes served by Joyden. Thankfully, the female waitresses made up for this lack of service by Paul. They were very friendly, enthusiastic and serve each dish with a smile! That’s why I still rate a 4 star overall though tempted to give them a 3 star. I was also tempted to give a 2 star for service but it would not be fair to these ladies. The ambience is nice, quiet and pleasant, no rowdy customers. I came for the moonlight beehoon and it tasted much better than the takeaway I had at a recent meetup. The cod fish was fresh, served with ginger and spring onions, great combination! However, I didn’t quite like the Foshan coconut chicken soup which was cooked with coconut water, it didn’t have a sweet taste but rather a queer taste. I would try another soup if I were to visit again. I didn’t manage to take a picture of the Yam Paste dessert but my mum loves it! All 3 desserts that I ordered were actually very good!",
