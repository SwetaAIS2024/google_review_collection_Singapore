Every dish was delicious even though we did not order the signature fish soup in hotpot.\nGo for the sambal potato leaf. It's amazing.\n\nNote: Chef ah Wai previously operated at Clementi Block 308. Their menu now focuses on the hotpot fish soup.",

The cereal prawns balls, prawn paste chicken and garlic potato leaves were delicious as well. I like that the dishes were not overly salty or thirsty after eating. Only managed to take pictures at the end cos busy eating initially. Will go back and try other dishes !",

Will definitely visit again the next time in this area\n\nNote: the coffee shop is longish in shape so your table is likely to be in the corridor.  We were there at night but it was very humid and warm.  So bring your own fans and dress down to enjoy the food!",
