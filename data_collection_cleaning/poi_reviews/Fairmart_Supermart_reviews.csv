Tshi Tshi,1,"Dishonest in their weighing scale. The weighing scale was not in customer range. The Indian man said it weighed 570gm but when I took it home and weighed it, it was only 562 gm. He profited by more than 50¢. If he cheated many customer, he can earn a lot of money. Authority must take action against this  dishonest shop.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101030311295908812975/reviews
