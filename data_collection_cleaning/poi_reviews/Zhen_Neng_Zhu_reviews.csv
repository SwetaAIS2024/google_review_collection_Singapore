XY C,5,"I love the handmade noodles here and I always come for the Tom Yum you mian (slim noodles, SGD6.50) which has above average spice level. The ladies who work here are always nice to me and know my order before I even say it. I can easily customise it by removing pork and ikan bilis (deep fried anchovies) from my food and they will add more vegetables for me instead. I do see familiar faces / regulars at the shop.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102084721777077961598/reviews
Yess,3,"Contrary to some reviews, we had no issue with the service. XLB was okay, got a bit of soup. The beef soup has nice broth although the noodle too soggy & has strange taste.
One of the eateries which still have seat during lunch crowds.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608068348961070416/reviews
류태훈,5,"I was very curious about this restaurant right after I saw reviews on google maps. Because people who gave 1 star mentioned about how bad the service is. Since I don't care much about services so I decided to visit here.

I'm Korean and I feel really hard to adapt to food of Singapore since I came here two days ago. La mian in here was the best food I've ever experienced in this country. It was delicious!!! Taste of XLB was soso. If this restaurant is located in my hometown, I'd like to visit here every week.

Facial expression of the staff made me scared but nothing happened. Maybe some people can think her as a rude person. It was okay to me.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114134670358029805293/reviews
Sidney Lock,1,"Average food, lousy service with stupid ques by the staff. Wanted to order a hot drink & was told to get it from Ya Kun. No wonder this stall has so many 1 star reviews & no lunch time queue. Rightly deserved so!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108532352166799061008/reviews
Chen Carina,3,Food is just alright. Alternative if you don't wish to queue too long during weekday lunch. I thought the la mian was done too soft. The broth for fish soup is ok. Fish is thin and not much of bite. I think colleagues quite like their dumplings with vinegar.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111996576432815242881/reviews
