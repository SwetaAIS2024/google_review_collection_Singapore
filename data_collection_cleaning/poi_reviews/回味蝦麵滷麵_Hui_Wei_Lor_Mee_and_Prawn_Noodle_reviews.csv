Hui wei Prawn noodle and lor mee North star

🍜 Food wise: Ever thought of having big chunks of fish with your Lor Mee? This stall gives you two big pieces of well fried fish, as though you are eating the fish from your fish and chips! The fish was firm, savoury and fresh! That was not all! The fish was half submerged in the Lor, so you could still feel the crispiness, the crackling satisfaction, so good!

The pork slices were like the cha shu on your ramen, soft, great pork flavours and with some fatty parts, they were quite generous too!

The taste of the Lor was great too, not too salty, perfectly balanced with the other two ingredients. The addition of the garlic and the chilli gave the lor mee the extra kick, the spiciness and extra aroma.

The prawn noodles were decent, but they were also unselfish for the meat and fish cakes, each mouth of the noodles was accompanied by some meat or fish cakes. The soup was good, with distinct prawn flavours, sweet and savoury. Probably one could have added the soup to the noodles to give the bowl a more prawn aroma.

✨ Ambience wise: Spacious and new eatery!

🤵🏻 Service wise: Staff did their job.

💵 Price wise: $4.50 each

Summary: Recommended! Will go again for sure!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100695078669204769827/reviews
Ojisan “Hiroshi”,5,"Did a 打包version of their dry prawn noodles $5.50 and I enjoyed it. It’s was a bowl of very decent prawn noodles. See video.

C/W 4 crunchy prawns and their pork slices were not dry

Their soup was umami flooded, however just a bowl of it will exceed your daily recommended sodium intake.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112623517876975514039/reviews

Prawn mee broth had taste of prawn. However, it would be better it had a better depth. However it came with 3 full prawns.

Lor mee broth was a little plain. But garlic, Vinegar, Chilli etc was self service. Came with 2 big piece of fish 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103383404265528637492/reviews
Kareen Frances Chua,5,"$4.50 for a huge bowl of Lor Mee, look at how generously they are with the fish and meat! I'm not a fan of Lor Mee but decided to try because of the good reviews. Glad to say it didn't disappoint. Previous reviews mentioned gravy is not thick enough, not sure if they made improvements because the gravy is quite thick by this time I visit. Certainly revisiting!

Would be great if you can consider making even smaller bowls with just one fried fish in the morning, good option for us who have smaller appetite at breakfast!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107251138755155947050/reviews
Jerald Lim,5,"Delicious lor mee with a herbal braised sauce and generous toppings including fried fish, lean meat, fish cake, and half an egg. The lean meat was thinly sliced hence it felt very tender, almost like a Jap-style ramen chashu. DIY for condiments including chilli paste, cut chilli, minced garlic, coriander, vinegar and pepper powder.

Visited in the morning and the young stall holder acceded to our request to change the piece of fried fish that had a big char on the batter outside. He explained that it was due to the frying process with insufficient oil but swapped it out for my order anyway. Thumbs up!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101913444524439383194/reviews
