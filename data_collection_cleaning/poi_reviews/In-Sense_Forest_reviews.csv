WF Chan,5,"This shop has one of the finest collections of Tibetan and Nepali statues and artifacts. If you are serious about getting a superb quality workmanship, this is the place to start your search. The owner of the shop is passionate & patient enough to share his knowledge on how to differentiate his best quality from the rest of common or average quality found plentiful in the market and net. And boy, he can be very funny with his spontaneous jokes. Highly recommended. An eye-opening experience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113494088134502609405/reviews

Andrew Ng,5,"I've known Melvin Wong, the owner of In-Sense Forest for well over 10 years now.  I've always enjoyed visiting his shop; from when he first opened in Pearl Centre to his now new shop on Kreta Ayer which is truly a pleasure to visit.  I would recommend anyone looking for high quality, handmade, unique and rare artifacts from Nepal or Bhutan to come in and visit and to have a talk with Melvin.  Truly a wonderful person with immense knowledge of the items in his store and the countries they come from.  From small trinkets to large hand-crafted sculptures, there's something for everyone in his store.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110578795056404337603/reviews
