We are very grateful for his selfless and kindness coaching.\nAlso, he will buy treats for his students in class and his classroom will always fill up with tibits and drinks. This created a less stressful tution environment and increased the bonding between teacher and students. My girl has good memories at his tution centre even she had graduated.  Thank you Mr Prakash:))",
