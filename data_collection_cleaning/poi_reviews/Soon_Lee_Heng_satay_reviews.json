The uncle in the shop who does the majority of the work anyway, attends to us with a smile despite being clogged in the smoke making the chicken wing and satay.\n\nFor this bias attitude and service, I am unsure how they are running the business. I hope the aunty reflects on her behaviour one day and changes before its too late to do anything.",
