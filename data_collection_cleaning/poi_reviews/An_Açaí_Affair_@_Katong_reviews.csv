goh sijin,1,My fiancé’s mom loves acai but I usually purchase it for her on GrabFood. On Saturday and today she ventured out to purchase from the shop herself. On both occasions the staff on duty were incredibly dismissive and rude in reply to her questions. She was so shocked by the attitude by the service on Saturday that she thought she might have went to the wrong shop. “See for yourself.” The young man told her when she asked if there is any dairy in the products because she is lactose intolerant. I like to add that she is always polite to a fault and that the staffs in Acai Affair Katong simply can’t be bothered to explain to a senior who is trying to buy Acai for herself for the first time. She is so kind that she still bought from the lady serving her today. I would really like to express how disappointed I am with the service in this outlet. Please seek to improve and don’t bully the elderly.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115708290918235272627/reviews
佩霖,5,Small but cozy space to dine in and spend time with friends. Been here twice and the taste of Acai is still quite nice. Service crews were friendly and helpful.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112294964251639153966/reviews
阿宝,4,"This place looks small from the outside but if you walk towards the end of the long & narrow path, there are actually sofas at the back of the shop that can accommodate more people.

They taste well but came with quite a steep price :-).

Staff are lively & fun loving!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
Lucien Lim,4,"Aside from the relatively high price tag, I loved my order (triple A). There was a great balance of flavours, textures and sweetness that I felt hit a sweet spot. The interior is nicely designed as well, offering opportunities of aesthetic pictures.

Overall a good place for dessert or a light, refreshing bite/drink.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106399175318288658924/reviews
Ng Xiangquan,5,Great vibe and atmosphere accompanied with delicious food that you can eat guilt-free. Staff was very friendly and helpful in recommending a bowl to my liking for my first experience. Would definitely come back again!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114836478042055895166/reviews
