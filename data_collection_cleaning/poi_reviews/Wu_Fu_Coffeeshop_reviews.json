Big portion of fresh and the curry is appetising! Sometimes, when the fish head is finished, it will be replaced with fish meat, which cost $15.",

We love the charred smell and taste, will be better if the 锅巴 is not charred to black (the chef needs to be more patient and control the fire well). The chicken is well marinated and tender. 1 claypot rice at $7 can feed a big eater or 2 adults.\n\nTheir soups are great too. We ordered lotus soup and ginseng chicken soup. My dad loves the meicai pork! Will be back for herbal chicken soon",

Smoke travels easily, and I believe stricter enforcement is necessary to prevent this.\n\nFrom my observation, the two individuals smoking appeared to be aware of their actions and were constantly looking around, likely to avoid detection.",
