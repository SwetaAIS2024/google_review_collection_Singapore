      "text": "Another place to have one of Singapore’s favourite communal dish, fish head soup or He Tao Lor as it is commonly known in Hokkien.\nTrue to tradition, the soup comes in the usual metal pot with burning charcoal in the centre that keeps your soup piping hot.\nI like the soup here. It’s thick but not overly salty. The Batang fish we chose did not come with a single bone so I was impressed. Fish was very fresh. The other dishes we had were all good. Prices are very reasonable and the Zhi char faire is above average standards.\nWorth a go.",

      "text": "Long time never visit this place, and my first visit after it has changed name to Queen of Wok. I find the 鱼头炉 standard has dropped, and just average, a bit expensive considering the amount of fish inside. The rest of food is just ok.  The sambal lala although a good size, but the taste is just so-so. Overall, I paid $230 for one fish pot and 5 small items. I don’t think I will be back again.",

      "text": "We recently dined at Queen of Wok at Rangoon Road and had a delightful experience. We ordered the fish steamboat with batang fish and ngoh hiong. The batang fish slices were fresh and tender, and the soup base was rich and flavorful, enhanced by the use of charcoal, which added a subtle depth to the broth.\n\nThe ngoh hiong was crispy on the outside and juicy inside, with a well-seasoned filling that complemented the steamboat perfectly. The service was alright, but it's a very nosiy restaurant with lots of customers talking at the same time.",

We (4) just did not like the prawn flavoring.  It seemed like they took dried shrimp mixed with some ginger and stuff and had a very light „flour“ coating   Was disappointing when many recommended\n\nWhat was delicious. Was hong Kong style noodles 4 stars loved it with bean sprouts carrots and eggs with chicken and small bay like shrimp(shrimp not so great)\n\nPotato leaves with garlic was also very good at 4 stars. In my country it tasted like another asian veggie. Every nice",
