      "text": "Very bad quality of product and services .found a lock screw get rusty and broken within 2 months . Then, I get a new replacement for it after waited for more than 6 months . Next then surprisingly , a same problem again happened to the new replacement set with a rusty lock screw within 2 months in used. Now , the staff said there will be have no more warranty.\n\nJust imagined , that you spent more than a thousand dollar for a rusty set of spectacles set and the staff told you that it is normal to happened .\n\nmoreover,  the staff  is so rude, annoying and disrespectful. They even can claimed that it is not their responsibility to sold you a bad quality of product and proudly told you that a similar  problem is just happened to many other customers .\n\nI got wearing glasses for more than 30yrs and this is the worse ones in my entire life . Paid for a thousand dollar and it only can be use for 2 months !!",
