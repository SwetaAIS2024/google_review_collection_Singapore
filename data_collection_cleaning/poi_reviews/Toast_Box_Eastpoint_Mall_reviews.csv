Anonymous Hero,1,"Absolutely appalled by the behaviour at Toast Box Eastpoint Mall.

My husband was publicly humiliated and bullied by an older male staff member, who even involved another customer with a clear undertone of indirect racism. The subtle, coded comments and behaviour made it unmistakably obvious. And all this, over the staff member’s own mistake.

I understand people work hard and get burnt out, but that’s never an excuse for rudeness or intimidation. Instead of taking responsibility, this staff member chose to belittle a paying customer.

To witness this kind of behaviour at a place that’s meant to reflect Singaporean hospitality is disgraceful. Shame on you. You are an embarrassment to the values this nation is proud of.

No one deserves to be treated this way. Toast Box, do better, starting with accountability and basic human decency.

P.S. My husband is a respected figure in Singapore. You should be far more careful about who you choose to mistreat.

P.p.s. The entire order was incorrect",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115049027637196677231/reviews
J Low,4,"This toast box does not have air conditioned seating but the drinks have been consistently good. Recently they phased out the use of straws. Today I ordered Milo dinosaur forgetting that there is no straw! How to drink this drink without straw?! When I tried drinking it the milo powder got onto my face. It was an unpleasant experience chilling at toast box this time. Toast box needs to have straws back for certain drinks, please!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113160356444669617780/reviews

An Teoh,2,"I am a regular customer at toastbox, I normally go to Ion, Wisma, Toa payoh, Somerset, Im a regular customer I should say, whenever I ask for hot water for my kopi, they will give me without hesitation. But today I experienced so awkward that one of the staff doesnt want to give me hot water, he said I have to buy it. Though I can pay for it, but they make me feel u comfortable the way they said it. And I dont get this treatment at Central areas.  Anyway, the service could have been better like what other Toastbox branch do. Esp I am a regular customer. I am just feeling disappointed.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117109243315014059563/reviews
