Nana Goh,1,"Tried the crispy chicken with ciabatta bread at Hans’ Café for the first time and was quite disappointed. The chicken was extremely dry, and the ciabatta bread didn’t seem freshly baked—it looked and tasted more like it was pan-fried. Instead of proper cooked potato chips, they served packaged chips that were overly salty and felt out of place with the dish. For the price, I expected much better quality. Unfortunately, I don’t recommend this dish and won’t be ordering it again.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106403080949728666260/reviews
Sandra,4,"1st visit. Pork chop looks dull but meat is actually v tender n juicy 5*. ""Never judge a book by its cover."" Beef stew is v fatty. 2 big chunks of fats to be discarded as there's nothing to eat... omelette is forever cold. Salad/Coleslaw by d side of omelette tastes raw n dull -1*. I'd rather be served d baked beans, like my pork chop.

Outlet is v v warm. There's a lot of heat felt even though we weren't seated close to d kitchen.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108444186723547263962/reviews
Madhu Kumar,4,"This is a chain of cafes across Singapore which serves south Asian cuisine especially rice, noodles based. They also serve authentic tea and coffee along with Kaya Toast, which is a must try. The cafe is very clean and tidy.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112894769687088566707/reviews
K K,1,"If I can give zero star, I would do it!!

Very bad attitude (rude) from the cashier, especially the aunty cashier and the aunty making coffee. Do not visit this outlet!! There many other F&B at Novena which has way better customer service than Han's.

Cake is not tasty at all.

Very bad.... In all aspect.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102071411014948965602/reviews
M C,4,"Food is not bad, and doesn’t take long to arrive. However it can be a little noisy at times, so if you would like somewhere quiet, sitting towards the front of the cafe may be better. I love their iced lemon tea!!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110881719579896197761/reviews
