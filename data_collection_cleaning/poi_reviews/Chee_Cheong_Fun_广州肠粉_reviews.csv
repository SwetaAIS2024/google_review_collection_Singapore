Touristmouse,5,"I chanced upon this eatery through a random social media post where the OP claimed it was the best, if not one of the best CCF in Singapore. I was initially doubtful but decided to give it a try since it's literally in my own backyard, and yet I had never heard of them.

And I'm so glad I did. Here's why:
There was no queue. Arriving on Good Friday during the breakfast peak, I was the only customer. They offer mixed meats, which means you get the best of both worlds. I went with the friendly owner's recommendation – prawn and char siew for $5 – and my order was ready in under five minutes.

The skin was perfect – smooth with a hint of chewiness. I have never come across skin like this in Singapore. The fillings were generous, and I particularly liked the minced char siew. The dark sauce had perfect sweet and savory notes. Additionally, the chilli was spicy and truly elevated the dish. In fact, this is better than the CCF I've had at restaurants.

Overall, this is definitely a must-visit. Make sure you dine in, as CCF won't travel well and that wouldn't do justice to the food.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110409011587721664076/reviews
Benedict Chua,5,"One of the best in Singapore, I dare say. A wonderful homemade chee cheong fun (CCF) stall with a hardworking uncle and a cheery auntie, who has a great memory and brings the plate to your table!

The portion aligns with the price paid, 5$ for a prawn CCF, and it was so delicious. The manual foldings of the CCF could be seen and gave a unique texture when devoured. The crevettes were succulent, nicely and evenly chopped. Shalots were a good choice, giving the sauce more flavour with a sharpness of an onion with a milder and sweeter version of a garlic’s aromatic flavour profile. This made a balance sauce base. The glutinous of the CCF absorbed this sauce overtime, visible through the lighter hues of sauce on the plate. It was not overly soggy. The chilli is extremely good.

The sauce receipe of this stall is very good, and the CCF too. Hopefully everyone in Choa Chu Kang tries this. Some may argue price point is too high, but it is really quality and large portions for a healthy sized citizen.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111915063884081471920/reviews
P Loh,5,Tried the egg cheong fun since it’s new to me. Very interesting combination where the egg blends with the rice flour for a silky and soft texture. The sauce goes very well with the cheong fun too. Unique chilli sauce. Will try other flavors in future,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106500811268054043566/reviews

NianZhu “BioGenie13” Bing,5,"My favourite Chee Chong Fun store in Singapore. The base is amazingly soft, made to order. Steamed to perfection.

If you like the Cantonese styles (light soy) with various ingredients do check them out if you are nearby.

Random find from Google maps! Thank you algorithm",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108522654824970345547/reviews
