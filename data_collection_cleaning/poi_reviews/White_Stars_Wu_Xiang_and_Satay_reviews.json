      "text": "The owner is a cool Indian young dude who sells Wu Xiang but Satay in the evenings. His satay is fabulously tasty guys. Tried mutton, Pork and Chicken satay and it's all wonderful. Great taste with charcoal umami! Highlight was his satay sauce. The sauce reminds me of Malaysia's Kajang Satay sauce with pineapple sauce mixed in it. Support this young hawker!!",

      "text": "The satay here is a MUST-TRY! Tucked away in a coffeeshop at Sin Ming but was blown away and pleasantly surprised that this was charcoal-roasted satay. The charcoal gave the satay a wonderful char and a smokey flavour.\n\nStall owner was nice and friendly! He came over with an extra serving of sauce when he saw from afar that we cleaned up his ngoh hiang sauce which we found out was his own creation. Wide array of Ngoh Hiang. Will definitely be back again.",
