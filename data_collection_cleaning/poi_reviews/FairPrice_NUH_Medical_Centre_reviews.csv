pham huyen,4,"It is quite small but having all things you need. However, pork and seafood finish fast and sometimes the quality of them is not as good as those in bigger fair price stores.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110199494031549488796/reviews
G Y,5,"Redeemed my free 1kg pack of Superior Fragrant Rice at this outlet (heard it ran out at others) - thanks to the new Credit Card signup under Trust Bank Singapore that was setup by Standard Chartered and FairPrice Group. There wasn’t any free staff at noon time to ask about how I had to go about redeeming it - so I queued at the checkout queue and the cashier kindly pointed out to me where I could find it. Redemption process was smooth - just click Redeem button and show the barcode to the cashier, who would scan it (and thus it’s done!).",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111376056027123649376/reviews

Kris,4,"A bigger supermarket than you might expect from this place. Small compared to other supermarkets, and might not have everything you want, but a decent range overall. Hidden away in a corner, so you'll have to look around a little.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104699263751750785038/reviews
Hui-chieh Loy,4,"Convenient, neat, usually not overly crowded. What's not to like? Not a huge selection given the space, but very decent nonetheless.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114631333018037022277/reviews
