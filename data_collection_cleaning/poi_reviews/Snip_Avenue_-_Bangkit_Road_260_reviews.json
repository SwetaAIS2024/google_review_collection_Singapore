      "text": "To the Management of Snip Avenue,\n\nI recently brought my child for a haircut at one of your branches Bangkit. During the session, after the initial cut was completed, I politely requested for some areas to be trimmed slightly shorter.\n\nThe stylist in question—a male, Chinese, chubby in build—appeared visibly displeased when I made the request. Although he eventually proceeded with the trimming, I was concerned to later hear from my child that he may have acted with unnecessary roughness. Specifically, my child mentioned feeling discomfort, as if the stylist was intentionally pulling his hair while trimming after my request.\n\nI am disappointed to hear this, as I expect all staff—especially when dealing with children—to maintain professionalism and care. No worry I will still consider visiting this branch again to experience for any improvement after this feedback. Should a similar incident occur in the future involving the same stylist, I will not hesitate to file a formal police report.",

On top of the bad techniques, he kept promoting products and packages and sounded annoyed when I refused to purchase them. Treated me with the littlest patience. Please train your staff!",

A good lesson learnt. The hairstylist can finish cutting your hair in less than 5min,so what do  u think ? This is the result !!!!!",
