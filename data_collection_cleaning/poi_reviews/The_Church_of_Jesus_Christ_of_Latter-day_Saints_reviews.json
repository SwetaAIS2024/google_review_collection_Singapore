      "text": "Very bad place, it is a nightmare for me. I live nearby, this church was renovated at first, the noise was very loud, but it is understandable.\n\nBut after the renovation of this church, the alarm bells often rang; the sound seriously affected the nearby residents. One time, the alarm bells rang from 1am to 5am on the night of 25th Feb; the second time was on 7th Apr when the place held a sports meeting and used high-power speakers.\n\nThis time, the alarm bells rang again at 3am on 28th Apr. Its existence makes it impossible for people to live a normal life, and it is completely torturing the nearby residents.\n\nThis place that does such immoral things will probably not be saved by God, but will straightly go to hell.",
