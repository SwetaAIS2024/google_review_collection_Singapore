We have been ordering their curry fish head every time we patronize their stall.

ky,1,"Overall food was mediocre. Their signature lotus leaf steamed chicken dish was tasteless and cold.
Dining experience felt rushed as the staff placed the next reservation's placard on the table and started clearing our dishes while we were still eating.
For a group of ~10pax, we were only given ~1hr 15min to eat although we made a reservation.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107271249705282070227/reviews
