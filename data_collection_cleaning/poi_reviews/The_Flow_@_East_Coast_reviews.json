Considering there are tuition centres and gymnastics classes here—places where children often go—this could be a health concern. It’s not just the lift; the whole building seems to have this issue. I even visited a beauty shop inside and there were still lots of mosquitoes. I hope the management can look into this and take action to improve the hygiene and environment.",

It felt like the mix of shops, restaurants, bars, and just businesses located here in general, is relatively modularly built up, instead of cohesively thought through.\n\nThe loft vibes across the entire building feels like the developers didn't have much of a choice, ending up having to squeeze an extra floor, or to make each floor shorter or taller.\n\nOne note though... I just can't stop wondering how many of them here are washing money.",
