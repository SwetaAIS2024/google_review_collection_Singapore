What a surprise stall I found in the deep of this Hougang housing area. Especially their fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle.

Let's talk about their Fired Hokkien Prawn Noodle, it was surprisingly full of wok-hey, with lots of seafood savory Umami and flavourful. If you eat on the spot, it might be very wet and slightly soupy, I believe they done it with purpose, that was the delicious seafood broth which is the source of great Umami taste. Even you take away, open after 30min, the noodle turn dry which soup already absorbed by the noodles, it taste even better than eating on the spot.

I'm glad that the cooking team done it so well. Definitely a big treasure for Hougang residents and those who knows this place.

They also served Char Kway Teow (fried flat thin rice noodle), it was taste not bad, simple and delicious, could be more on sweet taste, you may ask to add more chilli b'cos normal spiciness version I ordered was not spicy at all, but I'm happy on that.

They do pairing the other half of stall for fried carrots cake. Which they share same PayNow QR code. But for my selection, the fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle was the best and most worthy especially for new customers like me.

Definitely come back again and again especially I'm one of the fortunate Hougang residents. Highly recommended.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111255682252678932891/reviews

Ordered $5 Hokkien mee

Quite balance, not too dry, not to wet.
Aroma is there, taste is good, chilli not bad

The prawn is very very very tiny(smaller than my thumb) I am not a big fan of prawn anyway so doesn‚Äôt bother me much.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111322747117774848218/reviews
JATHL,5,"This is currently my number one pick for fried Hokkien prawn noodles. I cannot complain about any aspect. The taste is simply nostalgic. Really rich and savoury flavour with the proper type of cooked sambal chilli, which was also spot on for taste.
Prawns and squid were fresh, pork lard was crispy!
They only have one portion size which costs $5, and there are no options or add ons.
Great for those of us who prefer the old classic taste rather than the new age versions of this dish.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110357299060106350854/reviews
WDG Dingguo,5,"If you like the dry beehoon version, this is another stall to add to your must go list! Always wondering why so popular. Now i know why. I am a supporter of the drier beehoon version. And this one‚Äôs noodles just absorbs all the flavours. Prawns are on the small side but you get sliced pork , sotong and great chili to go with. Definitely a hidden gem of hougang ave 5",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118149297852514861223/reviews
David Yeo,4,"This stall is a 3 man outfit and sells other stuff such as carrot cake and char kway teow. At first, you might think it will not be specialized in HKM but it turns out to be good.

Well maintained ratio of yellow noodles and bee hoon, sufficient prawn stock umami, slight wok hei and definitely not overcooked or charred.

Tip though, can try to add $2 for extra ingredients such as prawn or sotong because they only give 2 prawns and few sotong bits for the $5 version shown below.

Came during the off peak hours because I hate to wait. Environment is nice and windy. Overall nice experience. Will come again if in the vicinity.

Located at Hougang Ave 5 Blk 309 Goh Lim Hwa Eating House.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110172442432868180876/reviews
