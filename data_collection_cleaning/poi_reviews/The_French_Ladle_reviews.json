      "text": "The French Ladle is a small and cozy restaurant with limited seating. Friday nights can be quite busy, so reservations are recommended. There is only one waiter which means service can be slow, but the staff remains friendly and attentive. The food is good, making the wait worthwhile. An added bonus—there is no GST imposed. It’s a nice spot for a casual French dining experience if you don’t mind a slower pace.",

They also serve a free loaf of bread that’s warm and fresh, and the chocolate ice cream was absolutely delicious. Overall, 9/10! More people should definitely try this place – plus, no GST!",

      "text": "It’s a cozy little family-run restaurant. Although the place is a bit old and small, the food is hearty, and the details are well thought out. For the appetizer, I chose the goat cheese salad—the slightly toasted goat cheese had a rich flavor that paired perfectly with the salad. The main course was beef cheeks, which were incredibly tender and melt-in-the-mouth. For dessert, I had an apple pie, served warm. It was a simple three-course meal, but it was very filling.",

The Catch of the Day I had was simply one of the best fish dishes I've had in a while. Water is free of charge, but the set lunch did not include coffee or tea, which cost an additional $3. Overall, it was a nice environment for a quiet lunch with good food.",
