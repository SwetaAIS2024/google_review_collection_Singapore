I was looking for a bouquet with 5 rose stalks and baby‚Äôs breath, but unfortunately, only 3 stalks were readily available. Nichi went above and beyond by personally selecting and matching additional stalks to complete the bouquet beautifully.\n\nHer dedication, attention to detail, and outstanding customer service truly impressed me. Thanks to her efforts, I left the store with a lovely bouquet and a happy heart. Nichi is truly an asset to your outlet, and I sincerely appreciate her kindness and commitment.",

      "text": "What NTUC said, the seafoods price stayed put.\nOn 25/1/25(Sat) 9.45am went to Jurong Point FairPrice to buy Red Grouper.\nAsked few staffs and they replied, fishes not yet come with various of reasons, have to wait. Okay, waited till 11.25am, finally it arrived. So surprised that they have ONLY 2 BIG SIZES RED GROUPER and that all.\nOne of the senior any how point the small tuna (bonitoes) to me saying that are grouper fish. OMG what kind of service? Very disappointed.\nIs this a kind of promotion, no fish on sale yet say no increase of prices. üëéüò£‚òπÔ∏è",
