      "text": "I went to namaste for lunch today and ordered north Indian Thali set and one piece garlic naan. The garlic naan’s base was completely burnt as u see in the picture. The chicken in the butter chicken seems old or might not be washed properly. Because when chewed few of the pieces I can get the raw smell which made me spit out few of the bites. The restaurant was not much crowded too, just a normal day. I regretted to buy the naan to taste the butter chicken masala.\n\nComing to the good part basmati rice and dal tasted good, sweet gave in a small cup tasted good, vegetable side was decent but oily and papadam was good.\n\nSorry to leave less review, may be it’s a bad day for me or food might be prepared in a hurry. And this is my first to this restaurant and I am not a frequent customer.",

      "text": "I always have good experience with the delicious food from this restaurant. However this purchase will be my final one as the food taste has deteriorated and is now totally different from before. The chicken bryani tasted bland, the chicken tikka overly salty, dhal curry overly watery, the naan (cheese and garlic) all shrunk in size to half and the taste totally off. Papadum packed individually is only item closest match to before. Maybe the restaurant has changed ownership and chef.  But certainly don’t deserved the same rating as before and I won’t recommend others to try. Their money can be better spent elsewhere. I still thank this place for giving me a positive experience previously and hope one day I will have the chance to taste the same quality as before.",

      "text": "This place is one of the best places for Chaat\n. We tried their samosa Chaat and papdi Chaat and both were very good 5/5. We also tried their chicken biriyani it was above average, 3.5/5 in taste. Chicken fried rice was 3/5, chicken didn't taste good. Manchurian was high in soy sauce so quite salty 2/5.\nThings I didn't enjoy in the place was - they served food in random orders, for instance the biriyani came first then Chaat, fried rice and finally the Manchurian- right before finishing the fried rice. This was when the place had no other customers and had only one chef. They should pay attention to small details too. Otherwise this place is worth a visit.",
