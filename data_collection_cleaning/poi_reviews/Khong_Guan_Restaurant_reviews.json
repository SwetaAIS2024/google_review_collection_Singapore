They were very generous and the drinks are cheap! $1.20 for Kopi / teh. Hard to find such price points in Singapore these days. The eggs are huge and opened for you!\n\nThere is a Malay food stall which is v popular too. Will try next time.",

Seats are limited, so most customers buy n pack. Friday is filled with congregation from local mosque at lunchtime. I can eat here everyday!",
