Soup was good but not as hot as I hoped for. Using the NTUC Fairpricr app to pay, a 10% discount is given. Not a big deal.",

They use freshly made noodles with no hint of alkaline water Á¢±Ê∞¥ which is my yardstick for good noodles. The free bowl of soup is flavourful and shows efforts in the preparation. Worth patronising. Hope you enjoy as much as I do.",
