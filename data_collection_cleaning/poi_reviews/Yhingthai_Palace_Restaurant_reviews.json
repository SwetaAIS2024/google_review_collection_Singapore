      "text": "Summary: taste ok, serving super small, service ok, price too ex.\n\ngenerally, no complaint on the food in terms of taste, except that the price for the serving that you are getting and the quality theyâ€™re getting doesnâ€™t seem like it is very worth it. Moreover, there is nothing special about the service. It is decent no complaints, but also not outstanding given that they are pricing of food at this value, there is somewhat an expectation for the presentation or the service or just simply the feeling that youâ€™re getting your bucks worth.\n\nThe soup was pathetically small given that it was 14 bucks. I only order 2 bowls cos I thought we could just share it. But $33.5 (w/ GST) of soup was barely for 1 person serving. They gave me extra utensils but I couldn't bring myself to share. The spoons felt too big for the bowl ðŸ˜‚.\n\nFish was a good size for 3 pax , whether it's worth $155.9  (w/ GST)... You decide.\n\nI didn't even bother to take photo of the kailan, it was decent but not worth 18 bucks.\n\n3 dishes inclusive of a fish was a whopping 220 bucks.",
