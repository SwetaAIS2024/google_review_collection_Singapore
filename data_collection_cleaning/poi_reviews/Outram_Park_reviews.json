      "text": "Outram Park MRT Station is a major transport hub in Singapore, offering seamless connectivity between the East-West (EWL), North-East (NEL), and Thomson-East Coast Lines (TEL). The station is spacious, clean, and well-maintained, reflecting the efficiency of Singaporeâ€™s MRT system.\n\nWhat stands out is the clear signage and accessibility features, including elevators and escalators, which make it easy for everyone to navigate. Itâ€™s also conveniently located near key spots like Singapore General Hospital and Chinatown, making it a great starting point for exploring the city.\n\nDuring peak hours, it can get crowded, but the trains run frequently, so the wait is minimal. Overall, a fantastic and essential MRT station that enhances commuting across Singapore!",

(East-West Line [Green], North-East Line [Purple], Thomson East-Coast Line [Brown]) Near this station is mostly just residential and the Singapore General Hospital (SGH). It is also near Cantonment Primary School. Train signs are helpful, but you might still get lost as the station has a lot of passageways and people. Air-con is ok. The station is quite clean and wide.",

      "text": "I was feeling light headed with cold sweats on the train so I stopped by the station's bathroom. I was in there for probably 10 minutes because of an upset stomach, this was around 2pm, when I heard yelling outside the cubicle followed by constant sounds of the air dryer going off like someone was doing it on purpose. After I was done and got out, I realize the old lady cleaner was waiting for me to leave so she could clean the bathroom but she had a really bad attitude about it. She commented in chinese that I can take my own sweet time but she can't. Kind of appalled by what she said and took me off guard considering I was there before a cleaning sign was up and there were other people in the bathroom when I entered.\nI think she thought I was on the phone or something? Either way I felt like she could've just been more patient and waited or started with other bathrooms if she knows there's someone in there doing their business. Sorry, but I didn't choose for my body to almost black out on the train due to a stomachache ðŸ˜‚",
