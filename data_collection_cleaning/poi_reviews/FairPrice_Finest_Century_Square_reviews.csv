Hartono Harjono,5,"Located at basement level @ Century Square. Convenient grocery shopping at your fingertips! Shop at Singapore's largest grocery retailer with a wide range of products, price match online and in-store. Finest stores will offer a wider variety of rice from more exclusive or premium brands, which can sometimes give the inaccurate impression that products are more expensive.

They even have ready-to-eat meal and avaialable seat for us to enjoy the meal. Drink available at the counter. Highly recommended!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102944719141464210600/reviews
Victor Lim,1,"Had dinner and drinks at NTUC Finest - The Grocer Kitchen and The Grocer Bar.

Angus Beef Steak @ $65.30 | 7.5 out of 10
Angus Beef Steak @ $40.01 | 8.5 out of 10
Ribeye Beef Steak @ $33.27 | 8 out of 10

Went with medium done for all 3 steaks as it is my norm (SOP) for any steak place that I am not sure or confident about their understanding or skills with the steaks.

Good thing I went with medium.
7.5/10 was a bit medium well and tough & chewy.
8.0/10 was decent but a bit bloody.
8.5/10 was the closest to spot on with cooking.

Plating and display of the steaks need to be improved. Plastic takeaway containers is a bummer.

Miso Soup was nice. Salad and rice was normal.

Lychee Martini was good tasting @ $12.00 | 8.5 out of 10.
Long Island Tea was strong. Very good @ $15.00 | 9 out of 10.
Peach Blossom a wee bit disappointing. @ $15.00 | 8 out of 10.

Had a big issue with Peach Blossom pricing as the menu clearly stated $12.00 but the bar tender told me it cost $15.00.

NTUC should check out their menu versus register pricing. Not sure how true but this is not a good experience for consumers if the prices differ by 25%.

Dropping my review to 1-Star because of pricing disparity which cannot be verified.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108789096091155395479/reviews

vinxe,1,"The people manning the roast counter should not be in Finest. When we acquire the price of the Roast Pork Knuckle, both the men at the counter just say price is there. Cannot see yourself. This is not the service I expect here. Hope the manager look into this.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102542768773155156355/reviews
