Tae Wu,3,"This may be my 1st and only time here. Ordered Deer / Venison meat rice for lunch. Pretty disappointing. The meat were thin and pathetic, like those served in sliced beef noodle. The gravy is very soupy, feels like eating Mui Fan. Flavoring and taste is below average. Cost $10 before adding a sunny side up that taste better than the dish. Not sure of the other dishes.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118361110836429669506/reviews
Loki,4,"Used to patronise the old stall that occupied this unit when I was living nearby. Sad to see that it disappeared, but satisfied by the quality of food from this new stall.

Prices are reasonable and we didn’t have to wait long. Definitely can compete with the other 2 zichar stalls nearby. Recommend the minced pork fried tofu (not pictured). It’s so good we gobbled it up immediately and forgot to take pic.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101937176024039442948/reviews

Lynette Chan,1,"Upon ordering at around 6.20pm, the lady taking the order said it would take at most 30 mins for our takeaway food to be ready. After an hour, we were still waiting. Dine-in customers who arrived much later than us received their food first. When enquiring about our order several times, we were just asked to wait. Final time we asked the status of our order, they had not even cooked it yet. When we asked to cancel and requested for our money back, they refused. Parents with kids would understand how frustrating this is.  Food was ready only after an hour plus. A lady who placed her order before us still had not received hers. Never experienced such long waiting times when it was under the previous management. Quality of food has dropped as well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100493153953390379547/reviews
