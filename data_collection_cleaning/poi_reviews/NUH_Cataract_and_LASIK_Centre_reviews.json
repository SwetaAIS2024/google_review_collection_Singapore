Keep up the fantastic work!\nThe doctor Vivien Lim SY was brusque. Didn't even bother to return my greeting, spoke without looking at me, didn't ask if I had questions, etc. I get she's highly educated and qualified, but was there a need to act arrogant to older folks?",

Dr. Lim and their team were incredibly caring and professional throughout. My family's members had their operation done by the same Doctor as well.\n\nHighly recommended for his skill [fast and steady], professionalism, patience and empathetic.
