jointedlegs,5,"Dr Eileen Tan is a wonderful doctor and very detailed. She’s patient and addresses one’s queries adequately.

edit: Her counter staff are also attentive to patients' needs and will even inform us when the expiry date is approaching to help us make a more informed decision before we purchase. Appreciate the service.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111795132227127655027/reviews
MC,1,"What a joke this clinic is. I visited two years ago for a hair fall problem that I only experience in Singapore (when I went back home, my hair stopped falling and started growing again). I asked my Singaporean husband to call the clinic to check if I could buy their scalp protector again without having to pay for a doctor’s consultation ($250+), and they said yes.

However, when I went there today, they refused to sell it to me unless I saw the doctor ($250+). Funny how it was okay over the phone when they assumed I was Singaporean, but once they saw I was Caucasian, suddenly I had to pay extra. Sadly, this isn’t the first time I’ve experienced this kind of treatment in Singapore.

It was a scalp protector sold for 75$+.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117382193106636992673/reviews

Yin Zacharski,5,"I have been a patient for over 10 years. I live in the United States and continue to see Dr. Tan on my trips to Singapore. Dr Tan and her nurses have been instrumental in helping me deal with skin challenges throughout my early 20s and now in my mid-30s. Dr Tan is kind, patient, thorough and a true expert. I fully trust her diagnosis and treatment plans. I have and will continue to recommend her to my friends and family.
