Fiona,5,Doctor Ang is the only doctor that is capable of resolving my teenage and adult acute acne. He is a kind and caring dermatologist that is genuinely vested in his patient‚Äôs wellbeing (i.e. not a money hungry doctor). His lovely staff has always been warm and welcoming over the years. Thank you gifting me the clear skin that I have today!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109989055659179202506/reviews

pang shufen,1,"Angsty receptionist, extremely poor service. rushed to clinic and blindly wait for more than 40mins. Poor advice by doctor, expected more from an experienced doctor.ironically KKH behave more professionally and shared more knowledge. No patience with kids.
