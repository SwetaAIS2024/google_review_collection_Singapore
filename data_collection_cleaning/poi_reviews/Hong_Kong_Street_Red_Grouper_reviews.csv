X,4,"Ordered the butter pork ribs with rice, food is good but I think they’re either short of staff or inexperienced since the stall has just opened, so the wait was quite long. I think they need to better manage the expectations by informing customers of the waiting time before they place their orders + give buzzers/number tags as I see the staff getting confused about the orders too.

But the one dish we tried was good so we will patronise again!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103551466023238824972/reviews

Ferris Neo,4,"Most of the food are delish! However, the aunty got my order wrong on few separate occasions, and she asked if I didn’t mind the wrong order though she wrote it down wrongly. Like whutttt? Luckily the food was yummy.

Side note, they prolly have different chefs who cook with different ingredients for the same dish. It was still good nonetheless. My go to makan place now.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116675561289341541597/reviews
yun ong,4,"Our first try here. Lucky we booked for 10pax in advance and didnt have to wait long for the food when we arrived. Service varies but overall ok. Food was tasty, esp the fish head curry! We went to the nearby bakery to get a loaf of bread to dip into the curry. Cereal prawn, shrimp roll, signature tofu, prawn paste chix wings, long beans and the 3 eggs veges were all tasty and not much use of MSG.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111806815185403645187/reviews
Ezekiel Phua,4,"Food is good, however there is room for improvement with the service staff. Wrong my order wrongly and asked if I could accept the order she wrote instead. Service staff might be understaffed or untrained.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107317328981871164151/reviews
