A S,1,"Disappointing experience for a first-time resale home owner ðŸ˜­ Paid above market rate to polish and remove stains on old Volakas, but we ended up with a matte finish and all furniture already settled in. To be fair most stains were well taken care of except stubborn/deep ones.

Was offered a follow up session but only with water, which I donâ€™t think will make a difference compared to regular mopping anyways. Weâ€™ve resigned to the fact that our first home has a dull and matte marble floor.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111250556447844186411/reviews
Nur Farahiah,5,"Me and my husband were impressed with Aaron and his brother's workmanship and professionalism in polishing our kopitiam marble table and our terrazzo floor. Aaron provided his honest assessment and even shared the processes which help us understand the task required better before the work commences. We are grateful to find someone like Aaron, and thank you so much for all your help! Highly recommended.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112027812194334040131/reviews
MrA,2,"Spent $640 on marble polishing for the living room about 250 sqft. Unfortunately, the effects did not last and the stains resurface after a week. So it is NOT value for money. Because this is only a temporary solution. When I lodged a feedback to them, they told me to live with it and they do not provide a warranty on their work. They did not bother to return to touch up. It shows they are not customer oriented.

They quoted another $300 for polishing the bathroom which is less than 100 sqft. It's NOT worth paying. It's a waste of money.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112008289267740134602/reviews
