Flo Yeow,4,"It's a classic bakery and salad sandwich place. Good for lunch time, and if you're looking for birthday cakes for your colleagues. The chocolate fudge cake and the carrot walnut cake are both very yummy and fairly priced.

One thing though, is that lunch times can be quite crowded, which will hinder service times and quality.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Anissa Sariatu,4,"My favorite place for morning coffee run. Also going here for lunch although not regularly because the lunch queue is terribly long : they got only 2-3 staffs max to handle all orders and the individual create-your-own-bowl salad takes a long time to complete, resulting in very long queue.

Other than that, the coffee and cake themselves are fantastic, reasonably priced when you consider the good quality.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102130482118073339012/reviews
Kly,3,"Paid $17 for my salad and a soup. The soba in the salad is so mushy and grossðŸ¤® other ingredients are ok just the soba thatâ€™s so bad! Will never order that again.
Soup on the other hand was warm and hearty.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104106844849786226128/reviews

Wei Ping Ang,4,"Red Velvet Cheesecake ($7.50)
The cake was moist, the cream cheese in the middle was so good as well. Not sure if the black bits were vanilla bean/ ""cookies and cream"" flavour. Thought that the buttercream on the outside was alright, but that cream cheese filling in the middle was really good - I need a thicker layer of that!
