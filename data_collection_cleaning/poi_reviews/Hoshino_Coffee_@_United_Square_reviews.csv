Cool Dragon,1,"We ordered Hoshino @ United Square through Grab. When the food arrived, we were eager to tuck in to a hearty meal!

Oh but what a disappointment greeted us!

The moment we opened the cover of the lobster bisque, the rancid smell punched us in the nose with my reaction wanting to puke!🤮🤮🤮

Then we quickly opened up the rest of the order which seemed ok except the mille crepe which seemed to have melted (??)! Our house is jus 2 bus stops or 5 min away from United Square!

This is definitely a great letdown!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111581562324190364285/reviews
Liz,4,"Haven’t been back for a while but my girl was craving for her soft shell crab aglio olio 😅 which she devoured within 10 min 😳 and only gave me a tiny bit to try 😂 so definitely they were on point with that!! 👍🏻

However, I was quite disappointed with my steak as it was perhaps not the best cut as there were some stringy parts and some parts were too tough though doneness was medium-well 😖

Ordered the anniversary set so both of us ordered the fruit tea as we really like the fruits in there. Dessert was the Hazelnut pancake with a scope of icecream. I really liked the chocolate ganache actually 😅

Overall, they were prompt to service when we pressed the bell 👍🏻 Will be back but I’ll skip the steak next time 🙄💔",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103345417941751733700/reviews
Tan Theam Huat,4,"Been reading the other reviews about bad service, guess I was fortunate to receive good service during my visit. It was a Saturday afternoon during lunch, hardly much crowd. Enjoyed the Premium Wagyu with Omurice and their Salt Caramel and Banana French Toast.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112323134839303416655/reviews
Stephanie Goh,5,"We came on a late Saturday morning and ordered a Katsu Omu Souffle Curry Rice with Salad and Mini Soup combo, Orihime Blend and Hoshino Blend.

The Katsu was crispy on the outside and surprisingly I liked their salad as well. Loved their Orihime Blend, preferred it black. It's indeed light-bodied and mild with a clean taste laced with biscuity flavor. Hoshino Blend on the other hand is richer and smooth, goes better with a dash of milk.
Orihime is my personal favourite and I even joked that I want to bring it home.

Service was what I would expect from a restaurant which was decent.

I would come back again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114495973981670434850/reviews
Liwei Chiang,4,"We enjoyed our lunch here a lot. Orders the set lunch for 2. Everything tasted delicious. Can taste the cook’s effort in making them. Pasta was to my liking, no so creamy and not so bland. I didn’t even like omu rice, but I like this one. The desert was a bless. The different ingredients blend in nicely. We were so full at the end but still insist to finish everything. The only thing can do with improvement was staff’s recommendation when we ordered. A bit confusing…",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110831823629358579813/reviews
