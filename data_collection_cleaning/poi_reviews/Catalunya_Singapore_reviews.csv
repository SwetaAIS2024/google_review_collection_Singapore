Sky Teh,3,It's a nicely located Spanish Tapas restaurant with a nice view of Marina Bay. They do have this tradition of using small plates to carve out the roasted suckling pig dish before smashing the plates on to the floor. So watch out. We ordered 2 tapas and then shared a grilled ribeye which we thought was quite good.,9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109675071780744139905/reviews
Wii L,3,"Classy, posh restaurant that's set out in the water. Great for a romantic dinner. Food is okay and service is good. The bar is willing to customised cocktails for you.
TIP: Ask for a window seat so that you get a great view of the Singapore River during dinner.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112352616160601092271/reviews
Bogomil Balkansky,4,"Off all restaurants I tried over a 4-day business trip in Singapore, that one was the  best by far. Simple yet great fare that would give any restaurant in Barcelona a run for its money. Tapas are only OK, but the main courses are where the place shines. Tried the lobster rice and the signature fish dish. Both were outstanding.",12 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114428500793560998309/reviews
Henry Tang,3,"Come here for drinks, bring a date, or two. Ambiance is good.

Not the food though. I am no expert in Spanish cuisine but definitely have had my fair share of Spanish food in the past years.

Food wise, can get a little too creative and carried away with the Spanish cuisine. Been here three times and I always left hungry. Suckling piglet is overrated little piggies grilled with rosemary -- and it stank a little. Paella is not what you expect. Even the basic croquetas are a far departure from what I am used to back in Spain.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109974389372291951507/reviews
Lee Marston,5,"Fine, inventive Catalan inspired cuisine, with great tapas in a truly stunning location on Marina Bay. In line with some of the other reviews, it is quite expensive, but the quality of food, ambiance and wines make this a great place for a special occasion, for which it comes highly recommended.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110185402340085270963/reviews
