That I find it useful and perhaps even helpful for elderly patients who might struggle to remember things said.\n\nYou can utilise your CHAS benefits at this clinic. Reception staff was responsive and communicative.",

Dr Chan is as always very knowledgeable, professional and cautious in treating patients. His explanation was thorough and sometimes took the efforts to show you the photos or research on certain conditions. His staff was also very loyal and friendly too. Good work!
