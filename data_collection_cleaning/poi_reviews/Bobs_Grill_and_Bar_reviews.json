The food was equally impressive, packed with flavour and well presented.\n\nThat said, the prices were on the higher side, which caught us a little off guard. Still, for the quality of service and food, it was an enjoyable treat. Just be ready for the bill!",

Will post a Tik Tok video of it soon.\n\nWe were en route back from X-Park and I had checked the reviews of eateries along the way. Decided to give this place a try due to the good reviews and Wagyu beef flank 2hr buffet.\n\nWagyu beef flank was tasty and tender enough, though cooked more to medium well. Chicken was fall off the bone tender, broccoli was nicely charred and aromatic, mushroom soup and fries not bad, but garlic bread was not crisp nor garlicky buttery enough.\n\nWe had 4 rounds of the beef, including the first round. The 2nd round took some time coming and we had to ask thrice for the 3rd round, while the 4th round was quite prompt.\n\nMusic is nice, but too loud.\n\nSpent:\nRM213.45 @ Bob's Grill & Bar, Sunway Boulevard 88 (wagyu flank buffet RM92++ x2)",
