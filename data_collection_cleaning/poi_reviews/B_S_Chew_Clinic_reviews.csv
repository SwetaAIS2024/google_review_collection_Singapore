Jay Jay,5,Price is at the higher side however there’s reason behind it. Doctor Chew is super knowledgeable and his prescription always works.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112245662302924140889/reviews
Lilstrawberry,5,"My fam goes to Dr Chew all the time. It is expensive but his medicine works all the time. Super friendly doctor and it’s always comforting to get treated by him, knowing that there’s a high chance that it will be cured.

We only trust him the most around Jurong. Highly recommend to come. It’s not about the cost. It’s about your health and getting it treated. He’s very experienced.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112404582423578959236/reviews

Derrick Oh,5,Doctor was late but he gave me sound advice and really checked for my condition. Before him i been to 3 other clinic for my illness but most of them just listen to my symptoms and address accordingly. However Dr Chew really check for my condition and advice me on how to heal fast.He also encourage me to be positive to aid in the healing. The price was a bit steep but if I can recover I have no complains.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110989795259891877293/reviews
Vanessa Vinodhani,1,"Extremely worst clinic and customer service!
1) The receptionist talks like we owe her a living. Super rude.

2) Clinic opens at 9am. But doctor wasnt in till 945.

3) I have been here before for my husband's hand infection and it dint get better but we paid almost $200.

Dont bother going to them. When someone is sick, we dont ask to be sick. To be so rude about it, its not needed. The receptionist is suppose to be more understanding. No one wants to pay 100s over and still be treated as such.

A no go for me and my family ❌",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105389098558935608603/reviews
