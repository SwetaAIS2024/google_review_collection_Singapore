Mind you they mark up the price and they announced it.\n\nMy wife tried the fried chicken noodle. The chicken looks good. It was obviously breaded chicken. I was thinking the chicken might be slightly dry but i was wrong. It was juicy. The noodle was in between soup and sauce. My wife gave a thumbs up.\n\nThe place is bright and relatively clean. The chairs and tables were pleasant use. Think will return here for CNY after all.",

When I attempted to provide feedback to the supervisor, who happened to be present, it was not received constructively. Despite my polite approach, my concerns were dismissed. I hope the management will take this feedback seriously and address the issues to improve customer experience.",
