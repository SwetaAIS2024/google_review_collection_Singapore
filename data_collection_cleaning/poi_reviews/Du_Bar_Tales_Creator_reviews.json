The bar is located at first floor, and you need to ring the door bell for the metal door to be unlocked.\n\nOnce up the stairs, you will come into a nicely decorated space, with the logo of the bar, and you will be wondering if you are at the right place üòÜ\n\nThe door is hidden in the wall, on your left.\n\nThe bar is run by a young couple. You can order from the house menu or ask for bespoke creation. Just let them know your preferences.",
