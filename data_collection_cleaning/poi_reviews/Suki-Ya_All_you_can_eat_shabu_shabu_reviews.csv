jayden,4,"Standard and variety of food has improved over the years, remember having only raw food usually 2yrs back. Had not been eating sukiya for some time and decided to eat again and was surprised that they also do serve cooked food now and desserts.
Their lunch and dinner cold dishes also differs, dinner time they do have sushi too.
The cook food curry rice is not bad, definitely more worth it than before with the added cook dishes, the takoyaki is also not bad.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
Joshua Wong,4,"On a rainy night, hotpot is always in mind. Went to this Suki-ya outlet as they still accept reservation on the eve of Christmas.

I last visited this chain of restaurant many years ago, and they still maintain the food and service standards. As I am not that hungry, I opted for the normal buffet menu. The beef short plate is still nice though not the premium menu wagyu buffet. The vegetable and meat/fishballs selection are sufficient to keep your stomach full and fulfilling. I opted for the sukiyaki soup and the more simple shabu-shabu soup; both are quite flavorful.

The hotpot night ended with a small selection of fruits and ice-cream (I love the Thai milk tea flavour).

Excellent service by Sharon, Andrew and Robin, they are very attentive to our needs and requests. Will be back again to try their premium buffet menu.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107244780137289771541/reviews
James Allworth,2,"There is no way this place is worthy of its 4.7 rating. Be warned!

We got two of the premium offerings. It‚Äôs not premium. You can taste the quality and it‚Äôs not at all good. The beef has more fat than actual meat (see photos).

Not just that, the staff slow walked it. We had to ask three times for the meat to be served before they actually brought it..

We wanted to get fruit at the end of the meal. Well‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a no too! before the closing time they ran out of all of it. What‚Äôs worse though ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt tell us it was closing time. Instead they just let it quietly slip by so they don‚Äôt have to provide more food.

The service is average. The food is average. And I left the whole experience feeling like their intent is to deceive customers out of what they paid for.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109762420782407605052/reviews
D Gabriel S,5,"Had a wonderful dinner over the weekend at Sukiya. What made the experience great was the service of Robin who was warm and comforting just like the delicious soup. Such a friendly presence even when they were busy. I also saw him interacting with a young boy and his father in another table. He genuinely cares about people. Such a rare sight in this robotic world nowadays.

He was ably supported by Andrew and Raymond.

Will definitely come back soon.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113363179875294304181/reviews
