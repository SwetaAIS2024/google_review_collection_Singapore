"Yong Hui, Ronny Tan",3,"+ The only coffeeshop in the Haw Par Villa area. There's a dearth of cheap eating options nearby (next nearest hawker centres are Pasir Panjang and West Coast HCs which are quite faraway).

+ Food variety is decent. Unfortunately, the cheap and great Sin Thor Eunos BaKuTeh has moved away post-coffeeshop renovation/takeover, although there's now a new Hao Tian BKT but starting price is now $6.

+ Airy due to the high ceiling.

- EDITED: The SFA had announced in Feb 2024 the kiosk-based Visitor Management System (which requires online/ kiosk registration before entry), but yet to introduce it after complaints by tenants that it affects business.

- Parking is problematic due to the limited lots for visitors, unless you park at the far end of the Wholesale Centre. Walking from car to coffeeshop can be a hazard due to the movement of many lorries and forklifts.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103854866816776797/reviews

Steven Chong,5,"Coffee Point, situated along Pasir Panjang is a place to go for a relaxing jolly good meal.
So where about at Pasir Panjang?
It is at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre facing the main road.
The seatings in the food court are widely spread, so not too cramp and yet airy.
A choice of good local delights for your taste buds and also probably a couple of beers to wind down after a hard day work.
Come on over and check Coffee Point out :",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115061573763385962529/reviews

Miklos,4,"Newly renovated and took over from the previous kopitiam. Considering the location, is the most affordable comfort food in that area (haw par villa) with lots of seatings and different type of seatings, from 4 pax to huge round table that can seat 10 pax.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102392172058235258162/reviews
