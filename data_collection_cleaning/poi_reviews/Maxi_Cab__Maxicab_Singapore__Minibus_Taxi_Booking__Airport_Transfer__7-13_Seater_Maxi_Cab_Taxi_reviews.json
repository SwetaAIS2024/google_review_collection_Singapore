Had booked the ride on behalf of important overseas guests and he decided to upcharge them on the day of pickup. Furthermore, Fadly, the person-in-charge, was unresponsive when questioned. Will not use them ever again with this level of unprofessionalism.",

The driver was on time, and was at the same time extremely professional and very nice. Also, the price was much lower than their competitors I contacted. I highly recommend this service!",

Sent a cab on time but maxicab could not deliver to basement of condo as height of maxi cab more than 2.4m. Had to walk 10 mins in rain with many bags . When asked what we should do and why didnâ€™t he ask upfront on this, talked back saying he is not supposed to know about basement heights. Clearly not one who cares about his Clients. Best avoided",
