Superior Soup Young Chinese Spinach was overcooked, vegetable was too old to be called \"young chinese spinach\". Curry fish head was good, but can see that inflation got to it, fried tofu/brinjal/lady's finger quantity dropped significantly.\n\nDined in for 7, fortunately my grandma still likes the taste.\n\nI lived nearby and have been eating here on and off, would suggest looking at other table's orders before committing because their waiters tend to recommend the most expensive items on their menu (and that may not actually taste good!).",

Overall very good and worth another visit.\n\nThe boss is friendly and courteous, and invited us to return in the evening to try the zhi char dishes.\n\nI am impressed that they open at 5am.  Such hardworking people! üëç",
