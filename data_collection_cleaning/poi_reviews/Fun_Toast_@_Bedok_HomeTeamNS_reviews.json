      "text": "It was our first time visiting Fun Toast at HomeTeamNS Bedok Reservoir, and it turned out to be a really pleasant experience. We decided to grab a quick bite before heading into Action Motion for some fun activities.\n\nI tried the lou mai kai and was pleasantly surprised by how tasty it was — flavorful and satisfying, especially when paired with my kopi-o peng. The combination was simple yet comforting.\n\nThe place was a little crowded when we arrived, but service remained fast and efficient, which we appreciated. The surrounding environment also added to the experience — it was relaxing and made for a nice spot to unwind before our activity.\n\nOverall, a great pitstop for a quick and tasty meal. Would definitely come back again.",

Environment was very cozy, good place to chill out. But the collection system need to be improved. The drinks was collected immediately after purchase but may need to advise the customer to Q for drink first.",
