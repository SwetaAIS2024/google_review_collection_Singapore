That just means 3 starters (small portions) and 1 main course. It’s not 4 courses and does not include desserts.",

Service was really good and staff took care to explain all of the chefs intentions which were well appreciated. Not all of it came through but the intention is definitely there so sometimes didn't match up the the really beautiful narrative portrayed by the staff. Friend was really blown away by their rum cake which I thought was decent. Their dinner menu looks way better though.",

This gem perfectly blends Asian and French cuisine, creating a unique and delectable menu that left my taste buds in awe.\n\nThe food was simply outstanding. Every dish was a masterful fusion of flavors, beautifully presented and bursting with creativity. The Foie Gras, in particular, was a standout—perfectly balanced and exquisitely prepared.\n\nWhat truly set this restaurant apart was the impeccable service. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about the menu. They made excellent recommendations and ensured that every detail was taken care of, making our dining experience seamless and enjoyable.\n\nThe ambiance was elegant yet welcoming, making it the perfect spot for both special occasions and casual dining. I highly recommend Mad about Sucre to anyone looking for an extraordinary culinary adventure. Five stars all the way!",
