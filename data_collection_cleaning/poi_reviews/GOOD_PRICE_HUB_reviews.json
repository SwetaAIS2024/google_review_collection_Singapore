      "text": "If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to be treated like an inconvenience for daring to be a customer, look no further than this charming little convenience stall near my place. Based on several recent reviews, I see I'm not alone in experiencing the warm hospitality of their cashier – a Malaysian aunty with bleached blonde hair tied up in a ponytail and a permanent expression that screams, “You owe me rent.”\n\nShe greets every paying customer like it’s the worst part of her day (and possibly her life), and I've personally witnessed her tossing out curt, borderline rude responses to people just trying to… you know, pay for things. One of my neighbors – a poor soul – even shared that when he politely suggested she be a little more courteous, she shouted back at him. Now that’s customer engagement, isn't it?\n\nThe best part? There’s little to no info available about who runs this place, so if you thought you might want to raise a complaint or even just leave feedback – good luck! But hey, who needs accountability when you’ve got that level of charm behind the counter?\n\nPrices aren’t particularly great either, but if you’re in the West Coast Park area and feel like ruining a perfectly good day with a side of attitude and a splash of rudeness, this place is an absolute must-visit!",
