MH & El,5,"[LOK LOK] üç¢üî•Jio your friends to a lok lok party, and you don‚Äôt have to cross the causeway for it! Variety of skewers is absolute peak at Da Cheng Lok Lok @dachenglokloksg, with 90++ fresh veggies/meat/seafood etc to choose from ($1.10 per stick), and more imptly, IT‚ÄôS OPEN TILL 2AM making this the perfect supper spot!

I normally steer clear of deep fried stuff cos it will get jelat easily and/or they end up over-fried till black. But the fried lok lok here are crisp and yummy without the funky oil smell. And you can pair it with their selection to sauces - my favorite is their Thai chilli sauce cos it helps elevate the smokiness of the skewers while adding a tinge of tang to the savory flavor!

umake mehungry,5,"Dacheng Lok Lok lovers rejoiceÔºÅ No need to head to JB anymore!

Dacheng Lok Lok (Â§ßÊàêÊ∏åÊ∏å), a beloved Malaysian lok lok joint, has expanded to Singapore with branches at Tai Seng and Jurong East. They offer a wide selection of skewers, seafood, meats, and veggies, all at just $1.10 per stick.

A perfect spot for late-night bites and satisfying your lok lok cravings without crossing the border!

Don‚Äôt miss their dipping sauces, from fiery mala chilli to tangy Thai-style chilli. Plus, at the Tai Seng branch, you can try their famed 30-year-old JB wanton mee in both black and white sauce, sadly, it‚Äôs not available at Jurong East.

While enjoying my dinner, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how popular the Lok Lok was among the coffeeshop patrons. It seems to be quite a hit! I‚Äôll definitely be back again for more.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111406931807185833571/reviews
