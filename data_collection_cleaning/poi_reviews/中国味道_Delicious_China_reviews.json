This restaurant was closed for almost 2 years and now that they reopened, the food tasted better than before.\n\nMy personal favourites are their \"Ma Po To Fu\" È∫ªÂ©ÜË±ÜËÖê and cabbage ÊâãÊíïÂåÖËèú„ÄÇ\"Salted vegetable fish\" ÈÖ∏ËèúÈ±º is pretty nice too and they are one of the few places around here with Qing Dao Beer ÈùíÂ≤õÂï§ÈÖí.\n\nHaven't get to try all their dishes cause I usually pick those few favourites.",
