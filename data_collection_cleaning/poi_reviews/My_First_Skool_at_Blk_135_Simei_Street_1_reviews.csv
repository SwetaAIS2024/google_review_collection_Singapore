Lin Nicholas,5,"This centre deserves way more than 5 stars.

I have both my kids attending this school and truthfully speaking the teachers and principal go over and above in caring and nurturing the children. Curriculum activities are ever educational and fun. This school also has an array of outdoor activities to engage the children. We had like more than 5 outdoors activities this year already.

Both my kids 4 and 6 years old now always speaks their mind. They misses the school teachers and friends on weekends and always says ""i want to go school!""

They are a living testament of the great and hard work the school has done for them.

From the bottom of my heart,
Thank you to all teachers and Principal of  Blk 135/138 Simei St 1",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100611309802957054869/reviews
Amalina Y.,5,"My husband and I greatly appreciate the good partnership and constant engagement that we had with the principal and teachers here at MFS. They are very kind, nurturing and friendly.

They always have our children’s best interests at heart. The assessments that the teachers made for our children’s development had given us better perspective in guiding our children to learn through play according to their learning style.

The good thing about being a smaller centre (with appropriate teacher-student ratio, nonetheless) is that we knew all of the teachers as they often interacted with our children, even though they don’t belong to their class. The centre greatly encourages parental involvement through school trips, festive celebrations as well as DIY craft homework from time to time, which we enjoyed being part of.

Due to shifting of residence, we had to send our children to a different MFS centre. But MFS @ 135/138 Simei St 1 will always be the best and the most special in our hearts. We are very certain that our sons grew up with the best memories here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111741501758041202981/reviews
