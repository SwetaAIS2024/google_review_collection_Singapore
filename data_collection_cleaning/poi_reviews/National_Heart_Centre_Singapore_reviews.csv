Polar Bear,3,"Like to propose that the laboratory procedures in the system for the blood tests be modified to allow patients, especially increasingly elderly ones, who misplaced their order forms, to proceed, instead of waiting for copies to be re-printed. This is especially true for appointments made earlier several month ago. These will also reduce paper wastage and be environmental friendlier in this age of climate change. Will expedite the process too.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106990123722290112118/reviews
Thomas Hwa,1,"Around noon time today 12 :36pm, I accompanied my mother to Level 4 for her routine cardiac medical review, as per standard SOP, her BP must be check before review

We went to  4B for Patient Assessment, I am very upset that the service staff manging the measurement station raised her sore voice ,using English, twice. Each time she told her to wait as she claimed she had called another patient.

After her second raised voices, I am  upset and told her point blank that my mother do not understand English, she looked stunt, she kept quiet and instructed my mother to sit on a chair behind her and thereafter instructed the called malay couple for measurement.

She made a mistake , did not perform service recovery, and not even apologising for the lack of empathy when taking my mother measurement.
This is very poor service and lack of tact, empathy and above all very entitled.
This is a very bad experience for us

Ab Cd,1,"Female doctor lost her temper at my family member because a bit hard of hearing and had to repeat herself. Screamed at family member at one point cos she lost her patience. Hurried us out of the room soon after. How highly unprofessional. What to do. Need to see doctor. Not like we wanna be there any more than her. Saw a quote by some doctor on a bus advertisement at sgh that went ""treat your patients the way you want to be treated"". HAHA. Had a great laugh immediately.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117268567028410027392/reviews
