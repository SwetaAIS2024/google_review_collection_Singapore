Zach Teng,1,"I have been patronizing this stall for many years but I cannot stand the counter staff's attitude anymore after the last visit. The plump ponytailed lady with Tattoos at the counter is extremely rude and arrogant! Attitude sucks big time, as though we customers owe her something! Totally do not recommend!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114594258342296249896/reviews

Gan Tian Hui,1,"Saw a staff in the kitchen and an auntie was outside cutting vegetables. Called her so many times to ask if they are open already, but she refused to entertain me. Other stall owners were even looking at me. When she finally responded me she told me obviously its not open why cannot see myself need to keep asking. Is it very difficult to answer a simple yes or no? Didn't buy never going to again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107675381876036696176/reviews
Apple Chew,1,"When you receive such horrible service, everything sucks. Everyone owe their staffs a living, such an horrific experience. I placed the menu on the lower table for easy reading and wanted to ask the lady something she raised her voice and demanded for me to put it on the top table for her to see. The request was fine however the tone and gesture was utterly uncalled for. And then another staff passed the food, I asked for belancan, she kept insisting there is (yeaa there was green chilli), reached out to her again, she took out the green chilli and put the belancan in errr? Like ask before swapping?So rudee!
Oh and, they say the ability of the chef is determined by how they cook their eggs? The yolk is totally smashed :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113476199141513609567/reviews
Hieng Kok,1,"I cannot imagine them serving such soggy fried rice to customers. The rice is wet and lacks taste. I was third in line, and it seemed like all the staff, from reception to the kitchen, were busy, causing the food to take forever to come out.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116457600778489989516/reviews
