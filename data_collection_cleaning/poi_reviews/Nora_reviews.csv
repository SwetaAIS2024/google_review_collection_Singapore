Murni Kahar,5,"Fast & Furious service from Mr. Syed Faisal Syed Hussein. I called him on 15th Feb Monday afternoon, informed him my mum currently is in St. Luke hospital and looking for a fulltime helper ASAP. Mr. Syed promised to try his best to assist on the issue. With smooth transaction the helper is ready to work for my mum on 19th Feb Friday.
Many thanks to Mr. Syed and staffs from all my family members.
