Yi Liang Yap,5,"Went there for titdar (chinese chiro) because of stiff neck. Treatment is good because my range of motion improved after that. Price is also very affordable (SGD 18) and there was no queue, unlike the famous one nearby on Banda Street. The location is quite easy to find, located right across the connector bridge from Chinatown Food Complex on level 2.
