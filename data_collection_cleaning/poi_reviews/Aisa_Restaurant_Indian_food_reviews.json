Especially when 2-3 customers who came after me got their food and left within 5 minutes.\n\nUsually I have a decent experience with this restaurant, so I really hope this was an outlier because their food is really good for the price.\n\nRestaurant is also decently clean.",

      "text": "This small local Indian restaurant serves your usual mamak stall cuisine. Their curries are good and slightly more spicy than usual but for those who love spicy & spices, you would love this place. At the moment, they offer a lunch hour special for Mini Chicken Briyani for $5.00 & Mini Mutton Briyanj for $5.50, both meal comes with a cordial drink. I would say that is a good deal and the portion is nothing mini. Its a lot for locals and it comes with raita (cucumber, onion & chilli yogurt salad) & papadom.\n\nIn August (last month), they also had another meal deal but it was Mini Chicken or Mutton meal but instead of Briyani rice, it was served with white rice.",

Chicken Masala was spicy but tasty, the sauce goes very well with the Thosai.\n\nClassic Teh Halia that aint too sweet or overpowering. Total bill of $8 for a hearty and filling meal.\n\nFriendly service and quick serving of food. All good!",
