Lim Mei Hui,5,"Had the loveliest catchup with my friends at this amazing cafe and bar! Owner is super friendly, and absolutely love that it’s tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the food centre. Drinks were refreshing, and the atmosphere at night is also really nice for hangouts. Will definitely come back again, it’s must-visit hidden gem at Beauty World!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117300863391006803045/reviews
Yuxuan Zhai,5,"Been here a couple times now, and it never disappoints. The music is always on point, and the bartenders are super friendly—great service without any attitude. Drinks come out fast and are consistently good, which is kind of rare to find.

The vibe at night is just perfect—chill but lively, just the right kind of atmosphere to hang out and enjoy. Definitely one of my favourite spots to grab a drink and unwind.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115110241186197759995/reviews
Cheng-Hsien Hsieh,5,"I visit Better Days 1-2 times a week to unwind after work, and it never disappoints. The atmosphere is absolutely perfect—cozy, inviting, and just the right balance of lively and relaxed.
The staff is friendly and the music is great. It’s my go-to spot to reset after a long day. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a welcoming place to relax!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107913302903544405756/reviews

shufen,5,"Chanced upon this cafe by accident, and what a lovely new find!

My friend ordered strawberry matcha ($7.50) and I ordered Sour with Passion - cocktail ($18). Both drinks were really good!

I will definitely come here again- with my friends or on my own!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114741942754731249513/reviews
