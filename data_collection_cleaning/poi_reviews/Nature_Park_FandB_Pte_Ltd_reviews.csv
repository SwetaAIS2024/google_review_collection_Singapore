Jerry QUEK Cheng Pang,4,"It is located at Blk 159 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4.Its not visable from the main road.After turning into the  HDB car park, you still have to do some turns then you can reach it.The coffeeshop is not a big one and has limited selection of food stalls.But what interest me is that it has a stall selling Taiwanese foods
like Ru Rou Fun, Da Cang Bao Xiao Cang, Gua
Bao, etc.There is an infor board saying they will soon be selling crocodile's meat dishes.
It is not so common to find such a stall in local coffeeshops.I haven't tasted their food so can't comment on it, but will be back to try
out.
