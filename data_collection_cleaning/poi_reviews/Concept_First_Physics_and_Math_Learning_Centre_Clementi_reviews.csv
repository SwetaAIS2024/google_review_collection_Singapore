ziyen chan,5,"Despite joining the physics tuition rather late and a few months before O' levels, it has tremendously helped me improve my understanding of the physics concepts and as a result, pulled up my physics grades from borderline passes to an A1 during both prelims and O' levels. Mr Kong teaches in an engaging and effective manner, which allows learning physics to become less mundane and more of a joy. It has helped me develop an interest towards the subject. Overall, my experience at Concept First was a highly pleasant one and I would recommend it to all students! :))",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111811239987418094181/reviews

marcus chan,5,"Before joining Concept First, I found it difficult to apply my understanding of the chapters, and despite studying hard, I consistently scored F9 in my exams. After enrolling at Concept First, Mr. Calvin Kong changed my approach to studying. He taught me how to effectively break down exam questions by identifying key keywords, explaining what each one meant, and how to tailor my answers to meet the specific requirements of the question. With his expert guidance and support, my ability to answer questions more accurately and strategically improved. As a result, I was able to significantly boost my grades and achieved B3 in my O-levels.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112795473683163848984/reviews

Meizhu Lin,5,"As a parent of two teens, I have experiences with many tuition centres, but Concept First truly stands out. It’s a centre that genuinely cares about helping every child excel.
