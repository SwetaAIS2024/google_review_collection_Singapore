For a lot of people, this place brings back a lot of nostalgic memories, where swimming as a sport, brought the community together, not forgetting the various swim clubs from waterpolo to diving, to underwater hockey, and lifesaving training!\n\nIt was a place where time stood still for a long while, in a country so used to giving up its architectural heritage in the name of progress. Alas, progress has caught up and while there is probably no shortage of eager anticipation for its rejuvenation to be completed in the near future, an era is gone forever!",
