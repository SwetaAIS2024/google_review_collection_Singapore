Both had good value for money servings and the food is nice tasting.\nThe veg and meat at the Chinese Mixed Veg Rice stall is fresh and not over cooked. Had the food here a couple of times and not disappointed.\nI had the briyani at the Indian cuisine stall and it was good and not overly priced at $5.50 for plate of chicken briyani. The Indian rojak was okay too but the accompanying gravy was a bit too sweet.",
