Avocado,5,"super cheap cai fan ""economic rice"" at a nondescript address but with queues forever (they move fast). Due to the large crowds (mostly takeaways) they keep cooking the dishes hence its always hot and yummy. The ONLY reason to be here is really the fried chicken wing ($1.10 per pc ONLY!!!)

IT IS THE BEST in SG and I dare say JB!
somehow they are able to make the wings so good that they slide off the bones and the mixture used to coat it is OUT OF THIS WORLD.

Literally it's the hottest moving dish.

Opens from 8am (people q since 730am)

After takeaway it's still nice!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102582755252278407198/reviews
Ken Tan,5,"Prices here remains low despite increased cost of living. They still charge 2 veg 1 meat at $2.50. Their best seller is probably their chicken wing, priced at $1.10 each! Freshly fried with great taste, and itâ€™s super crispy!

I ordered 2 chicken wings, long beans, braised tofu, luncheon meat and 2 wu xiang balls and it cost me $5.40.

Other than the chicken wings, the rest of the dishes are just like a typical mixed veg rice stall, nothing shouts out.. but given the price tag, pls expect to wait about 40mins during lunch time. Can refer to the queue from the pic.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104582517812107260359/reviews
Winston Ho,4,"One of the cheapest economy rice in Singapore.

Tucked away in Hougang, this eatery is in its own unit at the bottom of a HDB block.
The kitchen churns out dishes constantly, so the food is freshly cooked.

This plate of 2 chicken wings (very good), fried egg and spinach costs me $3.50.

A plate of economy rice of 1 meat and 1 vegetable/ 3 vegetable dishes costs $2.

Good value and worthy of a trip!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109087882208981210478/reviews
chu xuan,5,"Chicken wings for $1.10, super worth. Crispy, salty skin paired with juicy meat.  Always see people takeaway a lot of them. Their other sides taste pretty good too, nostalgic like home-cooked food.

Small selection of sides but they are tasty :P

Make sure to buy a lot of sides for it to be super filling and still affordable! Especially when buying meat you can order 2 portions lol. I order 1 portion and it's like 4 pieces of meat.

Queue is kind of long but goes by fast enough. There are also a decent amount of seats and a lot of people dabao so you can sit there and eat.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900991350615107188/reviews
