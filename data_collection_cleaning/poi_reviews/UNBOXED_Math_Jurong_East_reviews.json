The teachers here are very nice and friendly, which made me feel comfortable around them as i didn't feel intimidated. This encouraged me to ask more questions when I was in doubt. Throughout the 3 years I attended unboxed, my math grades not only improved but also maintained A1 throughout. Nowadays, I also feel more confident when tackling word problems. I would really recommend unboxed if you want to unleash your potential :)",

      "text": "I'm extremely impressed with Unboxed! My child, who was in Primary 6, has been attending classes here for almost a year and has shown significant improvement in his Mathematics, from AL4 in Prelims to AL1 in his PSLE. The teachers are knowledgeable, patient, and genuinely care about each student's progress.\n\nThe centre's facilities are modern, clean, and well-organized, providing a conducive learning environment. These factors are what contributed to his Math grade for PSLE, which greatly exceeded his and my expectations.\n\nWhat sets Unboxed apart is their personalized approach to learning. They take the time to understand each student's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style, tailoring their teaching methods accordingly.\n\nI highly recommend Unboxed to any parent seeking quality education for their child. It's been a game-changer for us!",
