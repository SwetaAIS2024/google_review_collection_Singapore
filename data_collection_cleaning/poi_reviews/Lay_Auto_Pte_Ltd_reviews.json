      "text": "Wilson made my car buying journey exceptional! From the moment I arrived ,he was incredibly patient and transparent. Unlike typical high-pressure sales dealers, Wilson took the time to thoroughly explain the details of Toyota harrier hybrid without pushing me to make an immediate decision.\nHis approach was refreshingly honest - he allowed me to tour the car at my own pace and answered all my questions with genuine expertise. The handover process was smooth, and I felt completely comfortable throughout the entire transaction. He even brought the car to my mechanic for checks  before handover.\nI highly recommend Wilson to anyone looking for a stress-free, professional car purchasing experience. He truly understands the meaning of customer-first service and makes the entire process enjoyable.",
