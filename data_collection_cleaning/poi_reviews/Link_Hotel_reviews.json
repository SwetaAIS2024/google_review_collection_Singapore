      "text": "Me and my partner makes time for impromptu staycations in SG and JB every now and then and decided to give this hotel a shot after running thru the reviews on Agoda and also considering the short drive to town as well as the free parking offered.\n\nCheck-in was swift and the hotel holds a vintage vibe.\n\nThe room was quite spacious. However, the quality of the tv is so poor, not only it is one of the smallest I’ve seen in a hotel room and it’s placed in such a awkward position with a pillar block near the front of the tv.\n\nMeaning when two people watch the tv together from the bed, one party’s view would be blocked by the pillar, but I guess it’s not an issue since the tv images were “snow-flaking” anyway and pretty turning off.\n\nNext, the room didn’t come with any wardrobe nor mirror and ps, I’ve stayed in smaller rooms that comes with both.\n\nOut of curiousity, I decided to search for reviews for this place on google and to my horror, the reviews here are so much worse than what can be found in Agoda.\n\nThere were reports of cockroach infestation which fortunately we did not encounter but experienced the poor customer service which we fell victim to.\n\nIt happened after we decided to head out for dinner after checking-in and taking a short break in the room. When we approached the front desk to request for a parking coupon that will void the parking fees, this middle aged male staff at the front desk gave us a disdained response.\n\nInstead of asking us whether we are in-house guests, he treated us as though we are loafers trying to getaway with free parking and rejected our request immediately by saying that coupons are issued to guests only.\n\nThe whole incident was witnessed by the female staff who helped us with the check-in and after we told the male staff that we are guests of the hotel, he asked for our room number unapologetically and directed us to his colleague nearby.\n\nThere is no surprise on why there are a significant amount of people complaining about the service of this hotel google after we experience it for ourselves, I must say, the service really suxs .\n\nHonestly, there is nothing to shout about for this hotel, the nearest train station is a good 10 mins walk away. The outlook of the building also looks very run down, especially the drop off area at their parking side looks like it hasn’t been maintained since day one.\n\nSo think twice before booking this hotel, if you don’t want to ruin your holiday or staycation.",

      "text": "I’m really surprised by the positive reviews here, as the only good thing I can say about the hotel is that it is really close to public transport.\nThe room, bed linen and towels were dirty (even immediately after checking in) and I’ve even found cockroaches in the room. The whole building seems to be older and run down.\nThe bed is extremely stiff and uncomfortable.\nThe walls are really thin and can hear people in other rooms. Early morning was particularly bad as I could hear all the doors slamming and people talking as they were leaving. I’m also not sure if it was just bad timing, but the fire alarm has gone off twice during the night (so far) during my two day stay.\nI can’t really say anything about the service as my only interaction with the staff was when I checked in.",
