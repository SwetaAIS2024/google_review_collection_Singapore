      "text": "Additional edit: I have used his services twice now, each time he was very upfront, helpful and gave really great turnaround even when I told him it was okay not to rush. Really trust using his services and am more than happy to leave my pc in his care, unlike other experiences I had w other ppl.\n\nReview: Recommended by a friend to contact Dino when my desktop started acting up. Also decided to ask him whether I could upgrade my 6 years old setup. Dino was v professional, friendly and easy to talk to, and gave me very upfront info and advice on what I needed etc. At certain points he even showed me what was available on the market and he would provide comparisons, information etc. without any pressure to buy.\n\nNow my PC has been upgraded and runs v well, and I'm v appreciative of his work. :)\n\nThanks again!",
