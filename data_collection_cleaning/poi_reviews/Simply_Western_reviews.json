But a new one sprang up beside the drinks stall.\n\nAs I tucked into my grilled dory with rice set meal, I realised the food is more than passable -- hence the photo showing food already eaten üòÜ\n\nThe fish fillet was nicely done: lightly browned on both sides yet soft and moist. What wasn't right is the brown sauce drizzled over it -- this was way too salty!!!\n\nThe coleslaw was absolutely crunchy and creamy. I realised it was homemade as I saw the chef shredding cabbage when there was no order pending. Definitely need to ask for an upsize of this salad üòã\n\nYellow rice came in a huge portion such that I couldn't finish it all. It's not cooked Indian style with spices or raisins, but surprisingly good enough to eat üëç\n\nSo, this grilled dory set turned out quite satisfying. At $8.50, it's a tad expensive though.\n\nI spied deep fried dory on the menu, so I suppose we could get fish and chips here too üòú\n\nBefore I left, I asked about the weight of their ribeye steak -- it's 180g. That's something I'm likely to come back for, so till next time...\n\nP.S. It seems harder and harder to find Western hawker stalls in Punggol which serve pork chops! üò¢\n\n#MHTamChiak reckons he'd have to dig deeper into his pockets at places like Astons (at Punggol Coast) or perhaps Buddy Hoagies (in WWP) just to savour delectable bone-in pork chops.\n\nSo far, both places haven't been tested but it could be soon...",
