WhaleOfaTime,4,"It has lovely, well maintained campus ground n koi pond.  The aircon food court has many good food stalls at good value (much cheaper than foodcourts in typical malls).
Like the cleanliness n spaciousness.  There's a roadside field just before ITE building where I spotted 2 lovely migratory birds this morning...hope they drop by again:)
Ps. there's also a nice big air-conditioned Sheng siong, much cleaner than other outlets. Also a small Popular bk store n First Culinary, a popular chinese restaurant.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111593469415335645662/reviews
