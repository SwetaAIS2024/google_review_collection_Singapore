Lydia Tio,5,"The Mala Xiangguo ingredients is using paper order, by portion. Price point was not bad, too. Their sauce was very mild, but maybe because we ordered Less Spicy. Nevertheless, it was still quite pleasant to eat since their ingredients tasted fresh. Would come back to try it Medium Spicy and perhaps other things on their menu.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109953792528295741665/reviews
Karmen,4,"Second time eating here and ordered the same things cos they are so good! The cabbage had good ‚Äúwok hei‚Äù, but a little on the oily side. The chicken is a must try! Ëæ£Â≠êÈ∏°. I had kids with me and had all the dishes custom ordered to be less/ non spicy. Service was good and dishes served promptly. Only wished they serve ice for the bottled drink they had.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113787103630937842401/reviews

Sleepy Sleeping,4,"The mala xiang guo was quite nice. I ordered one type of vegetable, but it was not in the bowl when it was served. I am not sure if it was charged, so I did not check with them.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109760210623455273641/reviews
PSST,5,"I would describe as a neighbourhood eatery. The service is good and staff is courteous. I never like Mala pot until i tried here. It very appetizing as i love spicy food. Will be here almost every weekor more if i am not travelling. The other side dishes is good like the smash garlic pork belly, spicy popcorn chicken, century egg tofu, crispy spicy cucumber, etc.
My wife will usually order for less oil and less salt. Although i am someone with strong taste bud, the chef can made it with less oil and salt yet maintain the quality of taste.
I can't compare this to the best mala pot in Singapore, but i would still think that this is value for money. And it is air condition, place is clean and cosy.
