Genevieve Tan,5,"This preschool is truly a gem. The vast outdoor space is a rare find in Singapore. PG Curriculum includes lots of outdoor time like water play, sand play, gardening, etc. They even have a forest walk and a pond. Teachers are super caring. My kid loves it here. All in all, we feel very lucky to have found Children’s Cove!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115511318524202065677/reviews
Kevin Sim,5,"Children's Cove is a rare gem in Singapore and this is speaking having seen my child go through 5 years of their programme (even though COVID) from PN to graduating from Children's Cove this year, and we will miss the environment and settings.

Initially we were drawn to the school's impressive compound, with plenty of outdoor play areas and sun filled activities (particularly love the forest walk), but furthermore complemented by excellent teachers that were patient, caring and nurturing and much of the learning daily coursework was done through a fun and team-oriented experience.  Another plus is the excellent parents network fostered during the numerous group activities and drop offs, which has created a village-like environment.

One of my best decisions was to send our child to Children's Cove and credit and highest compliments to Principal Liza and her band of highly committed teachers for the love, care and contributions towards our child over the years and hope they will continue their excellent work in the future.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110551554735898989266/reviews
Enniati Rusli,5,Our little girl has been Children’s Cove since 18 months. The location for the early years is housed in a homey black & white bungalow setting with lots of nature nearby. We like that there is a lot of outdoor time.  Teachers are caring and all the teachers know the other children which creates a sense of community. My favorite part is the exhibition every term which we get to see the projects the children have been working on.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108577816991239408462/reviews
