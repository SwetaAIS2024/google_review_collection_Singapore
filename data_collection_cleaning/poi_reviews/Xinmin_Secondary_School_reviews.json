They’re very rude and have no manners at all, my friend just asked if there was a lost and found for her water bottle then the aunty say the tv there but which tv?? And second of all, the school should have a programme where for all sec 1s they have this programme where they get paired with random classmates and they can get to know each other more and be besties or friends.",

      "text": "Horrible general office staff, very confrontational and unprofessional. Not helpful at all when I visited the school... Spoke in such a rude manners and had such accusing tones. Spoke to a few of them and all seemed to work together to make harsh personal comments at me, did not help to answer my queries at all. Very disappointed with the lack of respect... Combined with the high turnover rate, I think it really reflects on the school's management. Can only imagine what the environment there is like, having such rotten role models for the kids. Highly do not recommend, other nearby schs like Zhonghua, Nan Hua, CHIJ St Joseph will do much more for your child's education.",
