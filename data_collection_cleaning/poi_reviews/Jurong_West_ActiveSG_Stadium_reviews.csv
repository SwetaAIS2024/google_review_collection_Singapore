Gregory Lim,5,"Very nice facilities!
The gym is deceptively big
Has a nice swimming complex on level 2

Nelson Chang,5,"I am a Taekwon-Do coach at this stadium, conducting my lessons in the Level 5 studio. I enjoy the great view every time before I start the lesson, facing the pool and witnessing the many activities happening in the stadium, making it a happening place for families. My class is every Tuesday from 5:30 to 6:30 pm on Level 5. I am a happy coach to have lessons here. 😊👍🌟Chang TaeKwon-Do Singapore 🇸🇬 81204311",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109076912370280422095/reviews
