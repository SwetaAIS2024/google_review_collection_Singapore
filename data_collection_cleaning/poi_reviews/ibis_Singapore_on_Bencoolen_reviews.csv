JOHN 孜善 (John),4,"My first impression of Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen was very positive. The check-in process was smooth, and the front desk staff were friendly, though the service speed was slightly slow.
Upon entering my room, I was pleased to find it clean and well-maintained. The bathroom, though compact, was efficiently designed with a glass door that effectively separated the wet and dry areas, making it very functional.
One of the highlights of my stay was the fantastic view from my room. Facing the street, I could enjoy the cityscape right from it. Bedside, the window design was perfect for relaxing and taking in the sights. Additionally, the lighting in the room was excellent, providing ample brightness, which I personally appreciated.
Overall, I had a comfortable and enjoyable stay at Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen. The cleanliness, smart bathroom layout, great view, and good lighting made it a pleasant experience. I would definitely consider staying here again!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102978792433791701198/reviews

Barid Baran Bej,4,"Rooms were clean and the hotel was located a good location with the MRT Rocher, just a short walk. Also a lot of eating joints nearby. Bus station is also just in front. Overall a great place to stay and the rooms, even though small do a good job. But do note they do not have bellboy to carry your lugguage, they charge a security deposit which they fail to inform me and made me hassle for the same. That was a bummer and on top of that, even though I had paid for the hotel much in advance they just gave me a access card for the first day since I was not able to pay them teh security deposit when check in. This was really insulting as it was not my fault that they could not inform me and I did not have cash on me at that time. I did had a global debit card but they declined to use it, so I have to get them cash that day for me to get access card working even though my room rent was paid well in advance.. Anyways, location is awesome, room had a small bay window which was great, well maintained and the room cleaning was done well. I would recommend this hotel but the hotel have to improve on their communication. If they can email me for upgrade then their security deposit policy could have been shared well in advance as well. Do mind it, I have been using AllAccor for some time and never faced this issue.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112133039192640946886/reviews
Audrey Chia,3,"Enjoyable and comfortable ambience.
Lovely selection of local and sweet treats for Hi Tea.
The only let down was the lack of plant based items on the menu. However, the friendly and wonderful service made our experience a positive one.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110018698358921697803/reviews
Lee Stex,5,"Totally surprised with the newly renovated room. Rooms are very clean, with temple view high floor. Breakfast selection is up to standard for Ibis, early morning pastries are fresh! Location is convenient with 7-11 downstairs, hawker stores and shopping mall around. Looking at pictures comparing with nearby hotels, the newly renovated rooms are price for value(there are rooms not yet being renovated). Elevator during peak hour sucks though....food in the restaurant is standard without wow but their Laksa is amazing fitting my taste!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118026208791477699274/reviews
