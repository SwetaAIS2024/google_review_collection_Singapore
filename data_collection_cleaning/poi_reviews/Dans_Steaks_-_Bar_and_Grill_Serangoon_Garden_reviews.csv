Nari,5,"Came here for a birthday dinner celebration for a family member and we enjoyed our meal. Dinner was superb and so was the service. Didn’t manage to catch the server’s name but the server was a British man who made our dining experience so much more enjoyable ◡̈
His cheerful and entertaining disposition was very welcoming. 100/10 would visit again ^^

Eric Lee,4,"I had lunch at Dan’s Steaks which is a very small steakhouse in the Serangoon Garden area.  Overall, I think the food is between 3 to 4 stars. The steak was cooked exactly to medium, but the serving size was quite small. It was pretty decent, but prices are considered high.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113775188408100673442/reviews
Caleb Leong,4,"Quite spacious and quiet especially on weekday lunch. Came for a celebration. The tater tots and mushroom trio were good and price friendly.

We had the sharing cut for the medium rare beef tenderloin, which I find apart from the crust which was well seasoned, the rest of it was abit bloody or lack balanced flavour and searing.

The beef ragu was a nice touch for a carb with tender beef meat. However I don’t think it was necessary option, could probably try more dishes.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100759920474115589081/reviews
Loy,5,"Ribeye was delicious! Beef was very fragrant and tender. The taste of the grilled was just nice not overdone and top layer of the beef is crispy.

The Aglio olio spaghetti however was a lil salty and dry. Bacon bits are overdone so is too hard.

Truffle Fries are crispy and has good amount of truffle oil.

Atmosphere is great and classy. Overall still a great steakhouse, If you are here for steaks.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111485556176212901757/reviews
