From there the instructors will teach accordingly but they will also impart whatever knowledge they have to the students whom are willing to learn more and have been revising on their own. I have only been with Intune Music School for only 6 months but I can see that the instructors are sincerely teaching the students regardless of age, races. I have learnt a lot from the vocal instructor and will be learning to play Uklele next with Intune also",
