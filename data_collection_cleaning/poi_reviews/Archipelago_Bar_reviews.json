Because it's prepared fresh, you will need at least 20 min for cooking. Maybe next time. The seating is comfortable and you can overlook the tarmac and the planes. Nice place to chill while waiting for your flight.",

The staff weren't really concerned about the problem, their excuse was they dont do the cleaning, and they were too busy chatting with their friends. Will never visit this place again!",

Even for the little amount of good you get, you'll spend more time in the bathroom after wishing you'd listened to my advice.",

      "text": "Archipelago, located in the recently renovated Terminal 2 of Changi Airport, offers a convenient yet limited dining experience. The restaurant provides a decent selection of beers, albeit pricey, starting at $20. However, the limited food menu and the indifferent attitude of the staff could use improvement. The service lacks warmth, and the menu would benefit greatly from more variety. Despite these shortcomings, given the sparse dining options in Terminal 2, Archipelago remains a necessary stop for travelers with no other choices. Will I visit again? Yes, out of necessity rather than preference.",
