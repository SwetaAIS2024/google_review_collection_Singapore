bearythots,4,"Jin ho jiak! Must try their meatball, ngoh hiang and dumpling all fried tastefully. Maggie mee was tangy and fresh fishball spongy. And not forgetting the savoury sweet and chilli sauces mixed in dry.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108454681619644276739/reviews
Elizabeth Elisha Ms Kueh,5,"The owners were very kind! And patient. I love their service, hard to find these days!

And most importantly is the food. Its fresh and self made. U can see them making the paste and etc.

They have special items like big mushroom w paste, big meatballs, fried items are placed separately and crispy!

I personally love their self made meat balls. Was really tasty and fresh. Even their Crabsticks have a Wanton skin alike wrapped around and tasted really good.

Their chilli is my favourite too!

Amazing lunch!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116463728634826205226/reviews
Sam Wong,5,"Their fried yong tau hu is very crispy and fried upon order. Beancurd and meat also soft. Soup base is likewise light and slightly sweet from soya bean. Coffee has strong roasted coffee bean aroma, bitter and less sweet. 6 yong tau hu items + coffee cost $7.6. 9/10",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115694236480258826587/reviews
Ravina S,5,"Was super hungry and came across this place. The guy at the place was so forthcoming with suggestions on what we can try. We went for the roasted chicken rice and fried wanton. Loved the taste of everything, even the soup! The wanton was big and juicy and very worth it too. Loved the way they served the chicken rice nicely too. Very worth the money. 3 thumbs up.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118387801871850799456/reviews
Mantou,4,"Ok some things I really like, some I don't. This place it's a stand alone store, which is cozy and quiet I like. Like the fact that they re-fried the fried stuffs and put separately. The fried tofu very nice, the instant noodles cooked just nice a bit al dente when you just started eating and then as you eat the texture softer, just nice. Don't like the Tau Kee, not sure is it not fried through enough of it's the quality, very rubbery hard can't bite through. The soup also a little bland for my liking.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118213126945726447138/reviews
