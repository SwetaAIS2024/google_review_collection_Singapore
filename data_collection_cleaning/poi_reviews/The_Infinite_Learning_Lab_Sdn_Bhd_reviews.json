But I saw lots of teenagers coming in and out of the building, laughing, playing, and also it looked like there were tutoring and study facilities with adult supervisors/tutors. People here were very friendly and kind. Everything looked clean and pleasant. However I think the East Ledang Management Office needs to be more clearly signed. There was no signboard or directions, and there were 2 sets of stairs going into different parts of the building. Some arrows showing which stairs to take would be very helpful!",
