Chee Bernard,5,Had a pair of desserts due to the ongoing 1 for 1 deal! Coconut flavored snowy ice. Quality remain the same despite being promo. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Speedy service also. Seats quite limited perhaps due to the rising popularity of the shop. Patience will reward u with a table within 5mins. Will come back regularly!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117542731581954412000/reviews

Myrah Sharif,5,"Three Little Coconut never disappoints! I got the Coconut MSW Chendolâ€”a must-have, especially if you love durian. I also tried the Sweet Potato Orh Nee Paste, which hit the spot, especially on a rainy day. The desserts are comforting and full of flavour, and the service is fast too. Definitely a place Iâ€™ll keep coming back to!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116946107225235103394/reviews

W A,2,"2nd time to the shop but was utterly disappointed on their food this round.
Use the kiosk to order, chosen what we want and make payment.
After a short while staff informed us lots of topping choices unavailable and urge us to change or top up.
Those popular toppings choices eg like taro or sweet potato and many more not available.
It was in the afternoon and many of their topping sold out?  Shouldnâ€™t the out of stock situation be informed to us before we order ? We are willing to pay $8.20 for a bowl of dessert that we liked rather than paying a premium but getting substandard food (like one big bowl of ice onlyðŸ˜…) . Appreciate that the owner can look into this to uphold their reputation.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110417806254642508670/reviews
