Sanka Illangakoon,5,I visited the Thian Hock Keng temple and it was a very peaceful visit. This is the oldest temple in Singapore and has Chinese heritage in terms of the impressive architecture. The temple is open during day time and you don't need a ticket to enter. There are incence and candles available for free but a donation is recommended. It has some areas where photography is prohibited but the main temple grounds is not. Highly recommended!,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104533761926811624203/reviews
Nataliia Semenenko,5,"Thian Hock Keng Temple is an example of traditional Chinese architecture and one of Singapore’s oldest temples.

Admission is free, and the temple is well-maintained with informative plaques for visitors.

Be mindful in hot weather - the smell from traditional burnings can be quite intense, better to bring some water. Also there are parts where photos and videos are not allowed to provide privacy to those who pray.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116773057785481445789/reviews
