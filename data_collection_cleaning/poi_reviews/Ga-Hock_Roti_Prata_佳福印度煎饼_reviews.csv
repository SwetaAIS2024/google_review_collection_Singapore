T greensake,5,"Had kosong roti prata ($1.70), onion egg roti prata ($3.00) & added samba ikan bilis ($0.50), was extremely tasty. Love the fluffy roti prata & the samba ikan bilis was the icing on the cake. Nice rustic setting, limited chargeable parking lots available.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
Jasper Teiw,2,"Plain prata is at $1.70, while egg prata is priced at $2.30. A little more steep than others in my opinion. But I wouldn't mind paying more if the food is delicious. However, prata was cold, very soggy and chewy, not much crisp on the outside.

Curry was rather bland and watery. Environment was full of houseflies.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115866313306662601048/reviews
Ma tt,1,"Happened to chance upon this place which is hidden from plain sight. The coffeeshop exudes an old school vibe, with limited number of stalls available (fish soup, fishball noodles, drinks and prata).

Tried the coin and was plain prata, and they were disappointing. The prata has no chew at all, leaning towards the mee huen kuih texture if you know what I mean. Coin prata was overly thick, and strangely, it was coated with sugar. The mismatched sweetness and thick dough with almost no crispness made it hard to take a second bite. The curry, while not bland, was watery. For the price, I would go elsewhere to have a more satisfying prata treat.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102382313505418526836/reviews
Manli Y,4,"Good onion egg prata that taste like 葱油饼！ Definitely worth trying if you’re around the corner - even though price on the high side. Average waiting time 10-15mins. Skip the sambal, it was average (sweet not spicy)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110043937928523914465/reviews
oXRYSTALo Ong,5,"Today, Donkey and I went to Sri Murugan Hill Temple for a Ganesha blessing.  On our way out, we stumbled upon Ga-Hock Eating House 佳福餐馆, and a craving for a hearty breakfast led us to its doors. The moment I stepped inside, I was transported back in time—it felt like a true old-school eatery, radiating a nostalgic charm. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting.

Donkey raved about their mushroom minced meat pork noodles, so I decided to give it a try. As per his recommendation, the noodles were indeed delicious, bursting with flavor. The crispy fried pork added a delightful crunch, taking the dish to another level.

Overall, my first experience at Ga-Hock Eating House was fantastic. I'd definitely give it a 5-star rating!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews
