Many of them small seeds !\n\nThe owners are pretty friendly.",

      "text": "Durian Teo was recommended to me by an ex-colleague 3 years ago. I've been ordering from Durian Teo and another regular seller during durian season and occasionally go down to buy in person. Honestly, the quality of their Musang King (MSW) has been consistently good, and their D24, XO, BG and other varieties are also decent. However, my recent order of six boxes of D13 was disappointing. One box came smashed, mushy, and wateryâ€”it was very disgusting. I sent a photo to the seller, and he advised me to chill it in the fridge before eating. Unfortunately, this didn't help, and I ended up throwing away half the box. Lesson learned, no more D13 from this stall.",

      "text": "Today I order durian from this seller through WhatsApp . He send me 3 boxes of MSW. I discovered that the durian send to me has many protruding seed with less durian flesh. I WhatsApp seller asking if I can change the delivered durians or can I visit  his shop to change ? Seller block me from his WhatsApp . Helplessly,  I took a grab down to his shop to ask for his solution to solve this unhappy transaction. Instead of exchanging the durians with better quality, Seller says he will refund me the money as he no longer wish to sell to me, I agree amicably. However, he  started shouting and insulting me with nasty words. He even mentioned about my mom who pass away many years ago . I am really upset , however I keep my cool to received his refund and left the place. Most probably teo durian is getting more popular because of publicity at FB but his rude attitude is uncalled for especially mentioning others mom in the verbal attack. He even raise his fist threatening to throw a punch at me . This seller attitude is very notorious. Will never visit this stall again to buy his durian. Regardless how successful a person be, he should hold his pose and be humble instead of arrogantly insulting his buyers. Moreover, being a seller for his durians, he should show good attitude in services instead of embarrassing himself in the public for his actions.",

      "text": "Pretty much a dishonest seller. He will sell cheap but give you all the potato durian. He will promise u free fruit but will not deliver and then block u if u complain about it. Go wake up your idea. If you think only you right the world wrong. Then mr teo that not the way to do business. If people kick you out of bukit timah, its because u r not honest in your delivery. And stop lying in your reply so far no one say you dont give gd durian. More than half the review here say you are dishonest. Are you disillusional",
