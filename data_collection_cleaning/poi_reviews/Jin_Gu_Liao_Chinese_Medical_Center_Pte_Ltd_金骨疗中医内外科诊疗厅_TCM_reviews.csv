Yuxuan Chew,5,"I have been visiting this TCM for many years now for all my ailments and injuries.

The treatments here are very effective.

They are run by the humble ‰∏≠ÂåªÁîüMiky Poh and his wife who are professional and honest in their trade. No doubt they have been in business for close to 15 years now.

Highly recommend! Although it's a little secluded in the West of Singapore.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116337418989860570284/reviews
