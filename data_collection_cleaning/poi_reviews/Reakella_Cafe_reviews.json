Hmmm and a cappuccino.\n\nThe only small downside is the atmosphere. It’s located in a lobby of an office building. But the food and team compensates that easily. Enjoy.",

We ordered a breakfast set, and the portion was perfect for the two of us. The toast was crispy, exactly as I had imagined. It’s clear that this is a café built with love and care.",

It happens to be a rainy morning view today. A calming place to be for a breakfast. We love the french toast with thick honey and fragrant bacon. The honey mustard nicely combined the classic ham and cheese toast. The avocado stack is filled with egg and of course the creamy avocado. Interesting bits of feta(?) cheese dotting the plate. Goad this place is open for breakfast from 0730. I’ll be back again.",

Reakella Big Breakfast is really good for sharing, I love the sourdough; it’s so crispy. The eggs taste good too, with a special flavor that seems like the aroma of sesame oil. I will definitely come back.",
