The Crispy Noodles were perfectly done, topped with fresh seafood and rich, thick gravy. The Fried Chicken Wings were served piping hot and crispy‚Äîan absolute must-try. The Rojak was well-balanced in flavour, while the Fried Rice with salted fish was packed with irresistible wok hei. A fantastic spot for satisfying local fare!",

We ordered the satay which was alright but the Rojak was outstanding. The sauce is light and the taste was a good balance of sweet, sour, salty and spicy.",

Lol.)\n\nLove it that they always try to improve their menu. Their lunch sets are always a good deal.\n\nLove their Singapore Rojak, Lobster Bisque Pasta, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Chicken confit, and Prawn Noodles.\n\nHere's a tip: Add about 10pcs of Chili Padi into your rojak and give it a good stir. It adds a kick to the dish!! Brings it to a next level! üå∂üå∂üå∂",

Food prepared and presented well, service staff (not so much the robot server) were polite and helpful.",
