spikefire,5,"We come to this coffee shop at least once a week during school term. Roughly once a month would eat this with my wife.

Ban Mian is full of ingredients and soup has robust flavour, akin to Qiu Lian of the old days.

Fried dumplings are handmade by the stall auntie and they are always fried to order, so it’s always fresh and crispy. Also filled with ingredients.

Auntie at the stall is OMO, she doesn’t talk much, but she’s polite with her manners. Even though I don’t eat at her stall every day, she remembers my orders and always automatically gives me the extra bowl for sharing with my wife. Really appreciate it!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115191695136549425281/reviews

Wilfred Loy Yong Kang,5,The Dry You Mian was one of the best things I've ate. Not expensive too for the portion! It is perfectly made with the sauce being very well balanced! Do try it if your around the area!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108637917446086511173/reviews
Jaiden Chan,5,Great value for money! The mala sauce is fragrant and strong without being overpowering but still packs a good punch. The dumplings had a nice silky smooth skin and generous filling. The made-to-order pork cutlet was crisp even after being dipped into sauce! Will definitely come back for more!,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113103678538732685693/reviews
G,5,"A very underrated noodle (ban mian) shop. The lady boss works there probably every single day, and her humble (and numerous variations of) noodles and soups are always so satisfying. Her Ma La noodle (Dry You Mian) is a must-try for Mala aficionados. The sauce is robust with a satisfying amount of heat and the all-important numbing spice.

Oh and not to forget, she has the best dumplings ever! You will often see people ordering just a plate of her awesome dumplings (fried or steamed) if they are not adding it to their noodles as a side dish.

Best soup dish: You Mian
Best dry tossed noodle dish: Pork ribs noodle, Ma La You mian, Pork cutlet noodle, chicken cutlet noodle",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112916055706142007559/reviews
