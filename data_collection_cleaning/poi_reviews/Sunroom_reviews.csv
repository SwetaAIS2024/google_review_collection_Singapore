Michelle Sin,4,"Dining at the Sunroom at Andaz was an overall delightful experience. The ambiance was chic and inviting, with stylish decor and a lively atmosphere. The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the cocktails. Expertly crafted and bursting with flavor, they were a perfect accompaniment to the evening.

However, while the pub area had its charm, the comfort of the chairs left much to be desired. They were a bit stiff and not conducive to long periods of sitting and socializing. Improving the comfort of the seating in this area would greatly enhance the overall experience, allowing guests to fully relax and enjoy their time at the Sunroom.

Despite this minor flaw, the Sunroom at Andaz is still a top-notch destination for cocktails and socializing. With its trendy vibe and impeccable service, it's a must-visit spot for anyone looking for a stylish night out.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107615007907425842026/reviews

Alan Chang,4,"After checking in and went to the room at Andaz hotel for staycation recently, my wife and I visited their Sunroom on 25th floor. Hotel guest can go there and get free drinks.
They have soft drinks, coffee and tea. They have one nice table at the corner with the view and it was take when I first went there.
So, my wife and I just picked one table and asked for a cappuccino and latte. They served with some murukku snacks and provided hand wipes.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108669249435086670410/reviews
