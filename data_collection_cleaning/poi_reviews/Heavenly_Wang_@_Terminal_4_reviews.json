Kopi is great too.\n\nHowever, service can be slow and don't even think about it if you don't have at least an hour before departure time.\n\nAtmosphere is chill and comfy.",

But portion is a bit insufficient.\n\nI ordered a kaya bread and it's pretty good.\n\nWent back on my 2nd visit, cause there is something in the kaya toast I had previously that kept me yearning for it.\n\nOverall, very rustic and beautiful deco making it a good place to sit, chill and enjoy my kaya toast set.\n\nThe bread is pretty good. The tea is passable but the egg seems cold to me.\n\nMy subsequent visit, I find the curry chicken to be pretty good and portion of the veg is good.",
