Ordered a å’¸è›‹èžƒèŸ¹and requested them to make it dry and not those sticky creamy kind.  I repeated 3 times and in the end I bring back a super over deep fried crab with sticky salted egg paste! Yucks!! The meat was all stuck to the shell!!!! I wasted $36 on this crab and In the end ruin my dinner. I had tried their other dishes as well, it's not good either. Worst restaurant ever. Never going to patronise them ever again! See and judge the photo by yrself for those who loves to eat å’¸è›‹èžƒèŸ¹",

She refused to give chilli and utilities even large order. Very rude attitude, spoil the shop reputation. The food was not so great. Paid for large size but got it way lesser. I will look NOT forward this shop until they rectify the issue.",
