Javene,5,"Great experience at Keystone Clinic! Dr. Locum is patient and truly cares about their patients. The staff is friendly, efficient, and always welcoming.

The waiting time is short, and everything is handled quickly!

Highly recommend this place!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105293617579698552917/reviews
Y Y,5,"Exceptional service by the lady receptionist! Visited on 17th Jan 25 around 5.50pm (didn‚Äôt get her name), it was our first visit and won‚Äôt be the last. Once entered, was greeted with a very positive energy and awesome attitude, making small chat and taking notice of my unwell young child. It‚Äôs been so long and very rare for such WOW service in GP clinics (usually front desk personnel is lifeless and the worst with attitude problem), keep up the good work! Love your enthusiasm lady, making a difference in this industry üëçüèª",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117184884018860010558/reviews
Yeo BK,1,"My husband felt giddy and I called to check if doctor possible to do teleconsult. Clinic opened at 8am but doctor not in yet. Staff said would check if doctor when he reached.
I waited till 830, staff told me doc had to see patient now as it was crowded. Only could get back to me later...I told her I had waited for half an hour, and she didn't get back to me, that was why I needed to text her n checked.
She just apologised.
I was hoping clinic staff and doc could have more empathy for patients and their care givers. We were feeling unwell, anxious and upset and was expecting a confirmation,  but they didn't seem to be responding promptly.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115921995747277278746/reviews
Â∞èËêå,1,"I had a really disappointing experience at Keystone. Due to CNY, I couldn‚Äôt see my regular doctor, so I traveled all the way to Tanah Merah. I was experiencing lower abdominal cramps, similar to period cramps near my C-section scar. The doctor did a quick, minimal check and concluded it was food poisoning from the previous night's hotpot. However, I had no symptoms of food poisoning‚Äîno vomiting or diarrhea‚Äîand I mentioned to the doctor that I had missed my period for a week. Despite this, he insisted it was just food poisoning.

To make matters worse, he prescribed anti-diarrhea medication, which I refused to take since I wasn't experiencing diarrhea at all. After the visit, I took a pregnancy test and confirmed that I am pregnant. This could have been a serious oversight, and I'm upset that the doctor didn't take my symptoms more seriously or consider the possibility of pregnancy. Very frustrating and disappointing experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102392625366206370649/reviews
