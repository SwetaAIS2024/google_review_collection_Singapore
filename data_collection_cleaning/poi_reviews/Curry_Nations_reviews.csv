Suhail Ali,5,"Fantastic place for lunches on working days. Not only their food but also their service is excellent.
Had my Express Lunch there. Vegetarian one is 9.9 while non Veg is 11.9 which comes to 13.1 with Service Charge.
Today's lunch had Lassi, Pani puri (4 pieces), Hot n sour soup, Papad, Chicken masala, Daal Makhni, Also Methi, Baigan ki sabzi, Chana bhindi, plain rice, Naan and Sabudana as dessert. Meal is quite sumptuous,  quality is good and service very quick. They even asked to refill the rice.
Veg one is definitely worth it while non Veg I felt was a bit expensive.
Overall excellent food and excellent service too.
PS: You can add masal tea for just 1SGD as a bonus.
