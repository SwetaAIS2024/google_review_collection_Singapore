kamsani sorani,5,"Bought the belleza bellona and chose to self pickup. When i arrived they explained to me step by step on the set up and i even bought the eureka specialita cos they quoted such a good price for it! I had issues with the coffee machine and they came all the way down just to troubleshoot the issue. Could not be resolved and immediately replaced it with a brand new one no questions asked.

Oh & they gave me a packet of their beans that they roast themselves & it is awesome! I am beyond happy & satisfied with their service from A-Z and would highly recommend them to anyone looking to purchase their coffee gears/beans!

Anna Ng,5,"We went to the showroom to see how are things being done and ordered a Breville barista impress on the spot.

Though this is an upgrade to us from our dolce gusto machine which used capsules before, we just wanted to level up our coffee game since both me and hubby always enjoy drinking coffee together.

This new toy in our dining area gives us loads of fun at the beginning and even until now. At least for novice like us, the coffee made is often drinkable.

Loving the machine and also the demonstration at the showroom. Thanks for your service and patience :)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115257057496285340749/reviews

Joshua Lim,5,"I recently attended a personalized class at BrewRatio, and it was an incredible experience. The class was tailored to help me learn about coffee, espresso making, and froth making, and it exceeded my expectations. The coffee I made tasted amazing, and I now feel confident in brewing a great cup at home.

Freeman and Tori, who led the class, were exceptionally knowledgeable. Their expertise and passion for coffee truly shone through, making the learning process enjoyable and effective. The care and attention they put into teaching helped me grasp concepts I had previously struggled with.

I highly recommend this shop to anyone looking to deepen their coffee knowledge or improve their home brewing skills. The experience was both educational and enjoyable, and the quality of the coffee speaks for itself.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104828105749581887352/reviews
