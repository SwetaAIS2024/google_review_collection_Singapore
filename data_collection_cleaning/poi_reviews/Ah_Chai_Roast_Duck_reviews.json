      "text": "Wanton noodles for just four bucks. Glad I added the ABC soup at three bucks as was a bit hungry.\n\nTaste wise very good! Noodles soaked the gravy, char Siew suitably good mix of fat and lean. Wanton nice and meaty. Dish elevated further by mixing in the sambal. ABC was fairly standard and put the vegs in my noodles to soak up the gravy.\n\nHad no expectations, and they exceeded that. Very satisfied. Will definitely come back. Would ask to add more char siew to five bucks, plus try their other dishes. They deserve more love for doing simple comfort food so well!",
