      "text": "Not one for me unfortunately... but alright if you're in the area...\n\nStandout item was the Lo Mai Gai; which comprised of well-seasoned chicken and evenly cooked flavourful glutinous rice.\n\nThe Char Siew Bao had a heavily sauced filling (favourable to a lot but not me personally) which was heavy on the \"sweet\" and low on the \"smoke\".  Bao wrapping itself was not dry but too thick for me.\n\nAverage items were\nBig Pork Bao, Pork Belly Bao (which was well under seasoned in my personal opinion).\n\nSub-par was the Siew Mai (absolute no-no for me).\n\nService, which i have read can be \"rough\" from other reviews, was fine.\n\nAnyway, not one for me, but do give it a try and decide for yourselves ‚úåüèº",

      "text": "Char Siew Bao & Kong Bak Bao really sedap. The char Siew has this smoky flavor & the Kong Bak meat was not too fat or too lean so you don‚Äôt feel jer luck. I don‚Äôt fancy kong  Bak but theirs is nice.  Big Bao & tau sar Bao was normal. Lo mai Kai rice is soggy, too much spice added for our liking.\nLady Cashier was in ok mood today  maybe no long queue that day. Spent abt $80 for 3 families\nSaw some houseflies on the Bao left near the steamer without cover. Pls do something\n\nLastly hope the cashier can do proper better packing . She must squeeze all the Bao together in the box until the skin sticks together so messy",
