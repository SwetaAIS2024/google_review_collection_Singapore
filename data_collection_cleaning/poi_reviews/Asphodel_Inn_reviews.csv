Mohit Mathur,4,"Overall a good stay. Room and bathroom were clean. First day, we had issue of ants in the room and air conditioning not working. Both attended when we complaint.  However Ants were back on Day 5. Taking away half star from overall rating because of this.

Toiletries are very basic and not so great quality, reducing another half star for that as well.

Rest everything was fine. Towels and linen were clean and soft. No fridge in room but cold water available in dispenser in ground floor.

Location is good because MRT Exit B is 350 Meters away. Near this exit B, there is an Indian Store available 24x7 which sells  goods on much cheaper than any of 7-11 I tried in Singapore.

Lots of Indian Eateries within 600-700 meters of this hotel.  The neighborhood is silent and clean.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108258894582024024819/reviews

Imelda Fani Swastika,5,"It baffles me why some people have rated this hotel with just one star. During our stay over Christmas, we (a group of three adults and one child) booked a single room and were met with excellent service throughout. The staff were courteous, friendly and always willing to assist, ensuring our experience was enjoyable ðŸ¥°",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104890684081216970028/reviews
Abhijit Dhobale,2,"Good location, Compact rooms

Our group of three stayed at this hotel for one night. The location is good. However the room was quite small, which might be challenging for traveler's with lots of luggage. Additionally the ac cooling was not effective, which made our stay less comfortable. Service was ok nothing particular memorable but functional.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110909516653611211099/reviews
