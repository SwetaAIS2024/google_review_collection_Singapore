Peter A. Knipp,1,"Springleaf PRATA @ Railmall, Bukit Timah

A Sunday morning outing that didn’t start well we arrived at 8.10 am!
Without a doubt the worst service ever!

A table next to us, came 10 minutes after we ordered, got served before us, and the server screwed up our order completely!

They were completely overwhelmed, likely short of staff, and the face of the server looked like thunder & rain plus argued that there was nothing wrong with our order!

Our next table, a bunch of Sunday morning cyclists, 1 female, 5 males, probably in their mid 30th, looked like a PMT bunch, talked so loudly like they owned the world, didn’t give a crap on other diners near by, and when they left the table, left it behind dirty and filthy! And here I thought Singapore has become a gracious country! Nope it didn’t!

Food:

Prata :
I had 2 Kosong, my buddy had one with egg, our 3rd companion who arrived a little late, didn’t even bother to order as he could see the staff were not able to handle!

The Prata itself, was the usual Springleaf style, a tad crusty but looked more like a flat dense bread! Definitely not a fluffy style

3 out of 10

Fish Curry Gravy :
You are better off to bring your own, the thick floury style sauce was below average, hardly had any resemblance of a fish style curry, and the tamarind was hardly noticeable!

2 out of 10

Chicken Curry Gravy :
Actually if you buy Yeo’s Chicken curry you are better off!
This thick & floury gravy was totally abmissal! Probably the worst I ever had!

1 out of 10

Over all Quality of food? Below standard! Actually not just disappointing, completely unacceptable!

Only surpassed by the worst service ever!

Go somewhere else it can only be better no matter how!

Sunday morning was completely spoiled!

Alvin Lim,3,"Spring Leaf Prata Place is a must-visit for prata lovers in Singapore! Known for its crispy, fluffy pratas with creative fillings like plaster blast (egg and cheese) and milo dinosaur, this eatery offers a delightful twist on the traditional dish. The pratas are perfectly golden and buttery, served with flavorful curries that elevate the experience. While the place can get crowded during peak hours, the efficient service and affordable prices make it worth the wait. A great spot for a casual meal any time of the day!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118302592391028803090/reviews

Keith Er,1,"Resturant - Messy with so many staffs. Doesn’t have a good flow of cleaning and keeping the place neat
When we arrived, the tables are dirty and only 1 person cleaning and maintaining the cleanliness of the place

Floor has food debris under the tables etc.

I think such conditions should be improved

Food -
Disappointing taste of Teh O Ice Limau
Lack tea taste, only diluted calamansi taste

Prata & Egg Prata- the only thing still worth eating
Curry - I only like the fish curry but today it’s very diluted too
Mee goreng - total lousy taste. Really bad",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101648258475493647941/reviews
DAVID LEE,1,"Quite a crowd on a Sunday brunch timing. Waited in line to take order & pymt. Teh came first but waited 25min for the prata kosong to come. After 35min, then came the rest of the order. Not really satisfied with the Kheema mutton curry as was served with minced mutton. Overall food was just ok & service needs big improvement. There are more better prata place. Won't return to this place.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101568190469914259870/reviews
