shawn lim,1,"The stall changed to 顺福 vegetarian, but the food was horrible. Can you imagine the owner cooking an entire plate of mock meat char siew, 烧肉, mutton, prawn, duck meat, fry potatoes and pumpkin without any seasoning? (see photo) I visited for three days, and every day the dishes looked the same. Some dishes even seemed like they had been left overnight. I did try to inform the owner about it, but he simply ignored my concerns. I hope this stall can find a new owner soon.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102532231813058581289/reviews
