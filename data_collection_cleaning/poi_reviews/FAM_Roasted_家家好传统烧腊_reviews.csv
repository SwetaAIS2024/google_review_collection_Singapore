R,4,"I visited this spot and ordered the roast chicken and roast pork curry noodles. Despite a slight queue, it moved quickly, and I didn’t have to wait long. The portion size was generous, especially with the meat, which was a pleasant surprise. However, the curry was a bit on the bland and diluted side and could use a little more flavour. Overall, it was a decent meal, but I think it would stand out more with a richer curry.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101187717960139599104/reviews
Dennis N,2,"I’ve been a quiet customer here since they opened on 1st July, but today I feel compelled to share my experience. The customer service has been disappointing. I was suddenly charged $8.50 for my usual order, which was always $7.50. When I asked, instead of a polite explanation, I was abruptly told that add-on chicken has always been $3 instead of $2. It wasn’t about paying more for extra chicken; it’s the way the staff handled my concern that left a bitter aftertaste even before eating the meal. I don’t think that’s the right way to treat a regular customer. To be fair, I’ve been dining here regularly, as seen in my food log photos, but after this experience, I won’t be recommending this place anymore. I wish them the best, but customer service needs to improve.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104988888938292694772/reviews
Steven Koh,1,"Bought 3 packet of chicken rice via delivery. They gave plain white rice instead of the usual chicken stock boiled rice. Paid $5.90 per packet. Absolutely no taste (both the chicken and plain rice).This is a total cheat scam seller. Chicken breast meat pieces were just 5 very small pieces(i specified breast meat) and were totally bland, tasteless and dry. Anyone looking for plain rice with tasteless few chicken pieces and also prepared to have a feeling of being cheated and literally being roasted by this store for the no value for money meal can patronise this store. Clearly the champion of the worst chicken rice stall in whole of SGP.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112786641854558472166/reviews
Edwin F.,1,"Review only applicable for order on 14-Mar-2025 1PM.

Ordered chicken breast rice (upsized) and was served with less than usual amount of meat for an upsized portion. And the chicken came in odd chunks instead of the usual way they are cut. The taste also seemed a little weird.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110763172323122893545/reviews
Yuan Feng Lim,1,"When I went to take away food and was paying, I asked the staff again about the total amount because the price he mentioned was unclear and did not match the price displayed on the cashier.
However, the staff responded in an unfriendly tone, saying, “10 dollars, 10 dollars! You can see it there!” (In Chinese) while pointing at the cashier screen.

What kind of attitude is this? Please review this issue—it’s really very unfriendly.

Strictly not recommend this stall at all!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102478915818732955199/reviews
