Arthur Pan,5,"This stall is a hidden gem! I was a frequent patron for a few years until Sep 2023 because they moved to the current location in Hougang RiverCourt. Portions are generous and food is delicious and healthy. Stallowners are friendly and courteous, and most importantly, warm and kind. They are also available on FoodPanda.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109554081842422306743/reviews
