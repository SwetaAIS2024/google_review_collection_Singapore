Mavis P,5,"Pleasantly surprised at how affordable the dishes were. I also like how the portions are small, so you get to order a variety to try. The fish were sold out when we were there. Tried most of the dishes and still can‚Äôt pin point my favourite as they were all really yummy!

My colleague‚Äôs favourite were the mala pork which I personally find it a tad salty but I guess that makes it go really well when you have it with drinks.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114405566593311003536/reviews
Angad Srivastava,5,"Phenomenal!

Just when I thought I couldn‚Äôt love Sando any more, they decide to drop this new izakaya concept. Excellent canto-japanese fusion tapas-style plates in a really chill space (the technopark area also feels so interesting by night). Food quality is fantastic, nice drinks menu, service is really quick and attentive (thanks Chong and team!), and prices are very fair.

We tried many more things on the menu than I have photos of and each one was excellent, so you can‚Äôt go wrong.  Glad to have something of this quality near home, without having to travel to Tanjong Pagar üòÅ",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112978051585503361656/reviews
