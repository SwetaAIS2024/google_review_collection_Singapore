Jason Sim,1,"Went in to istudio T4 on 25 Mar 2025 1150pm and was served by an elderly man. Approached him with the complete intention to purchase iPhone 16 Pro Max 256gb White Titanium at the price reflected on price board; however; I was rudely notified that the price reflected is “PROMOTION PRICE” with condition that I MUST BUY $250 worth of AppleCare. I asked where was this condition anywhere reflected in the shop, and he mentioned this is company instruction. I reconfirmed with him again if this is true, he confidently said yes!

I will make sure a formal complain to relevant authorities is made, as such unethical practices is surely not the first encounter per several reviews below.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114132439380974137402/reviews

The Genesis Family,5,"Not all storks are available, it's recommend you check before hand.

The iStudio at Changi Airport Terminal 4 is a great place to buy Apple products. The staff is friendly and helpful, and they have a wide selection of products to choose from. The store is also open 24 hours a day, which is convenient for travelers. I would definitely recommend this store to anyone looking for Apple products in Singapore.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114071894759795666732/reviews
