AT,5,"Wife and I were staying near by and decided to try butter and spice based on a friendâ€™s recommendation. The food was very very good. We had butter chicken, mutton Bbryani, and a lamb skewer. Everything came out perfect. Would go again next time we are in singapore.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107652008594170555842/reviews
Clara Chew,5,"Great food and lovely service staff! Ordered the holy butter chicken, palak paneer, garlic naan and kashmiri naan. So hearty and delicious ðŸ¥¹ We also ordered galub jamun for dessert and the staff generously gave it to us on the house. 10/10 would go back to try the other dishes again~ Loved the wall mural too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103270431040874689001/reviews
Kester Chan,5,"Our usual go-to for some Indian cuisine fix!
Been here way too many times, but still never gets old! Just look at how we wiped out our dinner.

If itâ€™s your first time here and youâ€™re unsure of what to order, just order whatever we ordered in the attached receipt! Quality Indian cuisine at just $20 per person! You will not be disappointed.

Service as usual, is top notch. We were extremely well taken care of by all the staff working that night. Always a fast and pleasant experience here at Butter N Spice ðŸ¥° We were also treated to free dessert to end off our delightful dinner.

If you love Indian food, this is definitely a must go!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101344462281666112996/reviews
Spring River,5,"Had a fantastic dining experience at Butter & Spice! The mutton biryani was absolutely deliciousâ€”perfectly spiced, fragrant, and with tender, flavorful mutton. The portion was generous and well-balanced.

Service was excellent as wellâ€”the staff was attentive, friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed. The warm hospitality really added to the experience. Definitely a place Iâ€™d return to for a great Indian meal!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105158022353465642378/reviews
chintan agrawal,5,"Went on a calm Sat afternoon. Freshly prepared super hot food. Loved the traditional taste. Especially the Dal makahni. Ambiance is pleasurable. Suppose good for dining in groups, small parties. It's a little tricky to find if you come from Marina Parade's side, possibly easier when approaching from Katong road.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106088073665133759327/reviews
