Elizabeth Tan,2,"If you're an arts student considering this JC, I'd advise you to think twice. Speaking as a former HELm student, the departments generally don't care about your progress and development in JC, aside from History and Math. Econs notes are extremely long-winded and unhelpful, and lit teachers don't really care whether you can keep up with the pace, regardless of whether you've taken lit before at O Levels or not. Exam papers are also not a good indicator of the actual As, which explains why the school's mean rp is pretty low. Also, if you're seeking help in dealing with stress, don't bother going to the school counsellor. In my previous experience, she made assumptions that I had autism just because I told her that my brother had it.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117160746498800263864/reviews
