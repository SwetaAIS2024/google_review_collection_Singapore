Lau Guan Zhen (Sean),3,"We came for company lunch week before CNY and booked two private table inside a a room with partition. Room is spacious and cold enough.
Service however is not so well as we sat for more than half hour and nobody attend to us for drinks and ask for serving. Serving of food is also quite slow.
Food some of it taste is good but some is not as for the fish is quite fishy but the boss is good enough to explain. Portion is ok as we quite full after finish it.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111510773764729640794/reviews
Ming Shen Tham,3,"Visited Uncle Leong Signature for lunch on a weekend around 12pm, and to my surprise, the place was completely empty.

We ordered a few dishes and unfortunately, the experience was quite disappointing. The fried ee mian was particularly bad — the oil used for frying tasted old and reused, which left a really unpleasant aftertaste. On top of that, the sauce was bland, and overall the dish just didn’t work for me at all.

We also tried some of their dim sum. The fried mango prawn dim sum was another miss — once again, the bad oil taste stood out, and the mango was bland and tasteless, far from the sweet flavour you would expect. As for the chee cheong fan and fried carrot cake, they were alright, nothing exceptional but at least edible.

Overall, I would say this place is just alright, but given the quality of the food, I would seriously reconsider visiting again.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116082735539712168059/reviews
Gopi Bala,5,"Popped in for a late lunch and ordered the fish head curry set that came with 3 other side dishes.

The fish head was tasty and  cooked just right. The vegetable dish was the star of the show, while the prawn paste chicken and braised tofu were also delicious.

The service we received was fantastic, and the overall dining experience was very pleasant.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114775727475904526433/reviews
Song Jin Ch'ng,3,"Overall, the food is average. Their curry fish head is not bad. But, the chilli crab is too sweet. Now, they start selling alcoholic beverage, so they do not allow customers to bring their own liquor.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113621653095687649290/reviews
