Now I know why my daughter’s friend always recommends this!",

My hair stylist is Xiao Li and she has been cutting my hair for years and I am very satisfied after each visit every single time.\n\nDecided to write this review after a negative experience in a certain hair salon at White Sands. Very blessed to find this salon and always looking forward to visit again.",

I tried a few hairstylists in shopping malls but she is still the best!  You need to call to book her time as she is popular with her customers.",

      "text": "WORST SALON THAT RUIN MY HAIR!!!!!!!\nThe first time I came, i make an in store appointment and the lady told me to wait 30 mins for my turn. I came back 30 mins after, another person came in and asked for hair colouring. The lady saw I was back and she kept entertaining the person who is asking for the colour. I just sat there and wait for her to inform me that i need to wait a while more. 15 mins later, she didnt even approach me to have the courtesy to ask if i am okay to wait, i stood up and leave bc my friends are waiting for me, the lady asked “ are you in a hurry?” So effing rude.\n\nSecond time around, i wanted to give this shop another try bc of the good rating. I only wanted to get my fringe trimmed, the same lady was entertaining  other customers, she asked a guy who was sitting outside to cut my fringe. I communicated what I wanted and the guy i think wasnt trained well for hair cut literally ruined my hair!!!!! He was using bluetooth earphone when cutting my hair. I had to went to another salon to salvage my hair but too bad the damage couldnt be done.\n\nALL AND ALL DONT EVER COME HERE!!!!!!!!",
