樱木花,4,"Definitely a great mall with almost everything like boutiques hopes, eateries, groceries and snack stores.

Kamal Indika Nanayakkara,5,"Tampines Mall is one of the best shopping destinations in the eastern region of Singapore, conveniently located near Tampines MRT Station and the bus interchange. It offers a complete and comfortable shopping experience with something for everyone—from families and students to working adults and seniors.

The mall is spacious, well-maintained, and fully air-conditioned, providing a relaxing environment for shopping and dining. It has a great mix of local and international brands, including fashion outlets, electronics, beauty products, sports stores, and lifestyle brands. Whether you’re looking for everyday essentials or trendy shopping, you’ll find it all here.

One of the best features is the variety of food options available. From fast food outlets like McDonald’s and KFC to casual dining restaurants and local food stalls, the mall caters to different tastes and budgets. The food court on the top floor offers a good selection of local hawker favorites at reasonable prices.

Tampines Mall is also family-friendly, with a large NTUC FairPrice supermarket, Popular bookstore, Watsons, and pharmacies for daily needs. The Golden Village cinema on the upper floors is perfect for catching the latest movies in a comfortable setting.

Another bonus is that Tampines 1 and Century Square malls are just next door, allowing shoppers to easily explore three malls in one trip. The connection between them is seamless, and you can enjoy an even wider variety of stores and eateries.

The location is excellent, and the mall is always clean, organized, and lively. Whether you’re coming for shopping, food, or entertainment, Tampines Mall is a great place to spend your day. Highly recommended for both residents and visitors looking for a vibrant retail and lifestyle hub in the East.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109967720850402274429/reviews
