Benedict Correya,5,"One of the best places to shop if you're looking for great deals. It's an outlet mall, so you can find discounts of up to 80% on big brands like Nike, Adidas, and Coach. The selection is pretty solid, from fashion to homeware, so there’s something for everyone.

The mall is spacious, and it’s easy to navigate with all the stores grouped by category. There are plenty of food options too, whether you're in the mood for local food or something more international, so you can grab a bite while shopping.

It’s a 5-minute walk from Jurong East MRT, so it’s super convenient to get to. Weekdays are best if you want to avoid the crowd, but even on weekends, it’s still pretty manageable.

If you're looking for a spot to shop and save, IMM is definitely worth checking out.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292377967743781974/reviews

Herman Chia,4,"I was served by Ms. Ivy from Owndays Optical Shop, and I was truly impressed by her expertise, professionalism, and warm demeanor. She was incredibly patient and meticulous in adjusting both my spectacles and sunglasses, ensuring they fit me comfortably. Thanks to her skillful adjustments, I can now wear them with ease.

I will definitely visit the shop again whenever I need optical services.
