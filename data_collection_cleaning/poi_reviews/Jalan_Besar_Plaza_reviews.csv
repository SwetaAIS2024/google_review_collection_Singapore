CK C,1,"Nothing much in this plaza. Majority of the units were vacated, with the remaining consisting mostly of hardware shops. Even with such low footfall, one has to pay $0.20 to use the toilet. Money aside, you have to get the key from the security at level 1 even though you could be in other parts of the building.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews

Charles Poiron,5,"Not a review about the plaza itself, but rather the rooftop parking. Perhaps a hidden gem in terms of parking since the streets below are incredibly busy and almost never has an available car space. The carpark itself has an old and narrow entrance/exit and is dimly light at night, therefore not anyone's first choice which means there's usually space available! Just park and take the lift from level 4 :)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107277345878369642371/reviews
