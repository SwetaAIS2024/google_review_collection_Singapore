Ahmad Ahmad,5,"l‚Äôve been to so many mamaks and was a bit skeptical about this Restaurant as it looks like a typical mamak. Apparently, Faaz turned out to be the best mamak I‚Äôve ever been to. Not to mention the excellent service from the staff and cashier, the food was all super delicious. I even recommended it to my family members from Kulai and Mersing, and they were all impressed and will come again too. The roti canai, murtabak, tosai, and goreng-goreng were all delicious. The prices are also very reasonable. May Allah Bless this restaurant and all the staff who work there.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111926987998642501452/reviews

Mohamad akmal Bin rahmat,5,"All their lauk and nasi campur/kandar 5 star delicious and recommended. Kambing, mutton, fish, chicken, beef, sotong, crab, kerang, prawn, sup tulang all very flavourful. Need to avoid during peak hours as waiting time is long due if you order ala carte as to o many orders by many customers. Dont matter as you just need to order your white/briyani and whack all the other food for you to take self service and eat so you dont need to wait if you dont order ala carte.. reasonable priced. Got fresh coconut, fruit juice, halal mojiito. Can tng or card payment.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114939531511651900288/reviews
