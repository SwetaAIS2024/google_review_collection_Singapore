      "text": "Avoid their signature noodle with mixed ingredients. Their egg Is raw and uncooked and both my mother and father had diaghrea after eating. Both the man and lady should be more diligent and attentive when elderly customers already remind them to cook the raw egg longer . The lady hygienic , didnâ€™t even bother to recook the whole bowl of noodles when the raw egg already mixed in it. She merely took out raw egg and pour hot water over it and put it back. Both my parents ended up in polymeric! Should report to SFA",

      "text": "Pretty good handmade fishballs and meat balls,i must say. There is very good bite to the meatballs and fishballs are bouncy and oh-so sweet and fresh. Definitely hand made as its not fully round\nbut ends in a tapered point. Their Chilli is also made from scratch & fresh every few days. And boy,does its pack a punch! Normal spice levels should suffice for the chilli eater here. I went for less spicy myself.\nNoodles were cooked well and tossed deftly with the correct amount of condiment sauces,neither too salty nor bland. Left me with wanting more after each bite.\nOnly small grouse is that the takeaway boxes is abit too small to handle the amt of noodles needed. It would be better if they could adjust the quantity to maybe just that bit more,to hit the sweet spot.\nChinese couple manning the stall is also very friendly,they will engage u in light hearted banter if its not rush hour.\nTry their number 3 menu item and then add 2 fishballs..U will thank me laterðŸ˜‰",
