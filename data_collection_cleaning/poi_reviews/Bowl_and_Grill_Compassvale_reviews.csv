One Pink,1,"I didn’t realize this was still Bowl & Grill, just with a new name and signage. Ordered the truffle mushroom creamy pasta with chicken chop — honestly one of the worst creamy pastas I’ve ever had. It was so bland and tasteless that I was really surprised. The chicken chop was equally disappointing — completely flavorless. Really wondering how they managed to survive all these years, even back when they had the old signage. Very disappointing experience.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111791916002871369705/reviews
Summer SG,1,"I always buy from this store when it was still Bowl and Grill because fish & chips is my pregnancy cravings but today I'm disappointed.

They raised the price so high and unreasonable. The fish is over fried and hard. It's a downgrade of the previous one. Fries is soggy.

I'm not buying again from this store",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105727109383124013430/reviews

Junhao Tan,5,"Honestly the dishes surprised me a little that it’s actually really substantial and tasty! Comforting, familiar western classics like the chicken cutlet, chop, popcorn chicken! You can also find DIY donburi here which was nice! Love the black pepper beef bowl, salmon mentaiko bowl too and the rice was pretty shiok too! Solid choice and definitely worth a try!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104781153773354375143/reviews
