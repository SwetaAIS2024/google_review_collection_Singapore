TLDR: delicious, cheap nasi lemak! Very worth to frequent and eat. Friendly service ☺️👍 Google reviews is not good but can see from deliveroo ratings this stall is damn WORTH!

5 pax and more seating allowed now. Slightly crowded with many mookata eaters during afternoon but dont miss out on the nasi lemak!

1 plate of nasi lemak set A 🥘 is cheap cheap at $3 and we love the chicken wings 🍗 ($1.50) so we always order extra.

The chicken 🐓 is absolutely delicious! marinated well so the fried skin if full of flavour, while the inside is still tender and juicy, not overly dry! We order and about 7 minutes later they come with the chicken wings hot hot 😍. They keep it marinated until customer order then they fry so always fresh and juicy! May not be so big but each bite is packed full of flavour.

The rice 🍚 is coconut rice, very fragrant. Portion is not bad also, just right. The egg 🍳, ikan bilis, cucumber all there! Sambal 🌶 is sweet and spicy, big serving.

The otah otah ($1.40) is quite a big piece, you can see from my picture. Spicy and tender, very very pliant and yummy.

The staff is friendly and efficient, we are regulars so the Vietnamese lady always know our orders.

Now they only open until 2 to 3pm? Not sure. Because dinner is usually mookata monopolize the customers. Definitely come in the morning/afternoon to enjoy this hearty meal! 😚👌

Overall, definitely worth frequenting and enjoying a nice plate of cheap and fragrant nasi lemak! 😊🍲",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900991350615107188/reviews
Shane Soo,5,I'll always support local food if I see it. Been craving for some nasi lemak and this stall hits the spot. Items are fried only upon ordering so expect a few mins wait. But it's worth it.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112988395035101014242/reviews

Mao Kun Goh,1,"Have been eating this stall's nasi lemak for a good number of times already, and quality of food has been good... Until today.

Chilli had a sour ""spoilt taste"". Hopefully will not have stomachache/diarrhea later today.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114538766216878026818/reviews
