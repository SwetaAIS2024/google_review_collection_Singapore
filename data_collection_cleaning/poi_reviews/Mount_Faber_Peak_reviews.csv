A B,4,"As is, a touristy place with good views and start of the cable car to Sentosa

Took a nice hike up to this point on the trail and then walked on to Henderson Waves and down to Depot Road.

Hot - so go with plenty of water and bug spray",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110960725765749160870/reviews
Aung Po Po (Po),5,"Loved Mount Faber Peak! Stunning views of the city and Sentosa, plus great dining options.

Highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116715682666130759535/reviews
Anni E,5,"We were here for the cable ride.
They have a ticketing booth here although I bought our tickets through their website, taking advantage of a Mastercard promo.

You just need to go straight to the rides and skip the ticket line if you buy your tickets in advance. I appreciate the staff looking over the queue because there were some visitors who try and sneak past other people waiting for their turn - she saw what they were trying to do and sent them back to their spot in the back of the line.

You can buy food here, they also have very clean bathrooms and a gift shop.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113279172452991418751/reviews

Jonique Life,5,"There is a couple of staircases to get up to Mount Faber. We loved this area as it is completely dog friendly which is great. We reached the Mount Faber Peak and saw this is the area to take the Cable Car! We saw many things while walking around such as different lookout points to view the city, different colonial houses, a small Merlion statue, the Henderson waves (which is a cool bridge) and then onto the South Ridges to see the Telok Blangah Hill Park (sadly the Forest Walk was closed). We hiked for approximately 6km, we found the hike to be medium in difficulty, with some stairs and hills. It‚Äôs a great place to get some exercise, see some good views and even enjoy a picnic up here. Make sure you bring water and are sun smart while here.
