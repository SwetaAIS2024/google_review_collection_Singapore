Lots of field for soccer / frisbee play. There are people flying their macaws too. River crossing if the weather permits. The park is separated into two by a major road, and construction work is ongoing. So much have changed over the decade with the transformation from a concrete canal to a naturalized river, a project part of the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme.",

      "text": "Some parts of the park are under renovation now, if you are coming here through the bus stop of Block 254, the park is hidden behind the construction hoarding. Walk a bit alongside the traffic to get into the park.\n\nThis park is big, and there are many things to do and areas to walk. When we were there, the river is more like a stream with low water debit but I remember it being much fuller on rainy season.\n\nThere are many benches to sit on if you are tired. Some with tables, some are located beside the river as platforms, some are longer lounge chairs. This must be a very nice place to come here with a book, a thermos of ice coffee, and a dog! It must be nice to stay nearby if you like outdoor.\n\nThe park is bright and clean, didn't get any mosquitoes' bite. There are many entry points connected to bus stops that connect to MRT station.\n\nPeople are walking with humans and dogs, jogging, tai-chi, read newspaper, contemplating life, or chit chatting. There is a good-sized dog park as well (where dogs can run freely inside the fence. You can get significant jogging distance here.\n\nOverall, I think this is a lovely place.\n\nP.S. It's so glitchy to update pictures/videos here now. Most of them don't show up even after multiple tries. (@%*%",
