Ribeye,5,"McDonald’s at Ridout stands out as a truly unique location for a weekend breakfast. Nestled within lush greenery, it feels more like a retreat than a fast-food joint. The garden setting is a highlight, with thoughtfully designed seating scattered across the grounds, offering cozy nooks and crannies perfect for quiet moments or a leisurely meal.

The seating arrangement ensures there’s something for everyone—whether you want to enjoy the serene pond views, bask in the sunlight at outdoor tables, or find shade under a pergola. The tranquil ambiance is a refreshing change from the usual bustling McDonald's outlets.

The breakfast offerings are familiar, with classics like the Sausage McMuffin, Hotcakes, and Hash Browns, but the surroundings elevate the experience. Enjoying a warm coffee while soaking in the natural beauty adds a pleasant twist to the usual McDonald's fare.

If you’re looking for a casual yet serene start to your weekend, McDonald’s Ridout provides an experience that’s as much about the location as it is about the food. A great spot to unwind and enjoy breakfast in a setting that feels more like a getaway than a typical fast-food outlet.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108129213100021627372/reviews
Zico De,5,"Extremely pretty and chill vibe in the evening times. A McDonald’s like none other in all aspects.

They have plenty of space as it gets a little crowded in the evening. A whole play area for kids, a pond with turtles, and a general well-maintained perfect photo-taking environment around the McDonald’s.

Has indoor aircon seating and outdoor seating too with McCafe. It’s actually quiet even with the people.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117863472029199389511/reviews

Melanie E,5,"A local told me about this amazing McDonald’s. Not only do you find different food, there’s a zen vibe to the place.

Food: 4/5 - they get 4 stars for different food such as dark chocolate sea salt frappe, Mcwings, chicken Mccrispy, white peach yogurt pie, caramel frappe, and dinosaur McFlurry.
Service : 4/5 server was friendly
Atmosphere: 5+/5 - the best environment I have experienced at McDonald’s worldwide. The Japanese themed garden called Ridout Tea Garden has bonsai-style foliage, raked sand and a pond full of turtles. Whether you choose to sit inside or outside, the zen vibe brings calmness and peace within. I could sit here all day. Equally beautiful is seeing the garden at night.

It’s worth checking out if you’re wanting a unique environment.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136896090209853190/reviews
