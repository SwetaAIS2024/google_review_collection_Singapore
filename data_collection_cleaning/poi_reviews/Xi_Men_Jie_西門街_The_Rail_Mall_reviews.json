My braised pork rice although decent was not as good as I would like.\nThe cheese and egg pancake was nice too. The prices are very reasonable and if you pay with Grab Dine Out, you can get 10% discount.",

We liked that it was relatively empty for a Sunday dinner time. Staff were prompt and polite and food was served really quickly after placing the order via a QR code. Reasonable prices and good taste for Taiwanese food. You also get a free drink now when you leave a review!",
