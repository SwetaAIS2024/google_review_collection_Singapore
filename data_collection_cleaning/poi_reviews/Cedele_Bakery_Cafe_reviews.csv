Chen Family,4,"Renovated with a very clean and bright outlook. Breads looked (and tasted) nice, and cakes (pandan ondeh) was quite pleasant. Service was patchy, as some of the older crew were a little tentative, but the supervisor was really good at sorting out our billing issues. Nice cafe, and would like to come back again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118145836301674418853/reviews
Deon Lim,4,"Great healthy options to choose from, and prices are reasonable. We had roasted chicken sandwich and salmon & avocado sandwich. Found that the walnut bread was superb!

Crabby Dancer,4,"Place has been renovated and menu has changed again, fewer vegan options but cafe is now more spacious and brighter with increased seating capacity. Prices have gone up quite a bit but the food is still good. Portions are decent. Service staff can be overwhelmed when crowd starts to form.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100688349581284563658/reviews
Nerissa N.,5,"We usually just get our bread from Cedele since it is within walking distance from where we live. The breads appear to be made more healthy and not sweet which are pluses for us. This time we had a late breakfast. The coffee was good enough. The eggs were cooked really well, the sausages were tasty, and the bread served with the meal was fantastic. The lady behind the counter was also the one who served us. While she was unsmiling and looked tired, she responded well each time we thanked her for serving our food and coffee. We definitely will go back there for our bread and for the occasional breakfast or brunch.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103712663010801748908/reviews
