olivier mendes,5,In Singapore for 7 years as expats and definitively the best doctor and experience I have had with medical staff in Singapore. Dr Lim is friendly and does not overcharge like most of other doctors do. No waiting and efficient process should you need x rays or the like. Highly recommended.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100150044532964699914/reviews

Sandra Lookman,5,"Dr. Paul is an exceptional and kind-hearted doctor. Although he cannot speak Bahasa, he still tried to explain to my parents, he typed all the words in Google Translate so my parents can understand all his explanations, which is very clear and easy to understand. He also did follow-ups on us, checking the updates from us. Giving advices and opinions. Never seen a doctor like him in my life. Thank you so much, Dr. Paul.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108137641010954297896/reviews
