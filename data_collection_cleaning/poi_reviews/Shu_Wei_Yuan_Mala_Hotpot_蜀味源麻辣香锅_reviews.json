The MLXG flavor really isn’t as strong as the usual MLXG, ie it’s not as salty and numb as others that I’ve tried, which I enjoyed because it felt healthier & won’t feel jelak. So if you love savory and 重口味, this won’t be shiok for you.\n\nI ordered 微辣 which I taste no spiciness tho, so will opt for 中辣 next time. The slice meat is fresh & chewy (not tough) which I like. Will def come back.",

While the ingredients are very nicely stocked, the mala xiang guo is bland and has no fragrance at all. Very disappointing lunch. How can the taste be so bad? Never coming back.",
