agatha lee,5,"I am incredibly grateful to Dr. Annette and Sarah for their exceptional care and professionalism in treating my twin children. Dr. Annette is wonderfully gentle and efficient, knowing exactly how to handle kids who are often scared during their endoscopy appointments. She provides such reassurance and understanding, not just for the kids, but for parents like me as well. The improvement in both of my children’s sleep quality has been remarkable since we started seeing Dr. Annette. I am truly thankful to have found a doctor and team who are so caring and dedicated. Highly recommend!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111138303938340649452/reviews
Horsepower 888,5,"When I first consulted Dr. Annett Ang, I was very pleased impressed with how she patiently asked questions and seek information to understand her patient.  She did the surgery for me, it went very well and the post-surgery care, and support has been great.  At Dr. Ang's clinic, you have the two most helpful assistance - Sarah and Chelsea.  They are very professional, polite and know their work very well.  I would recommend Dr. Ang and her team.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111768579380602750251/reviews
Rachel Chen,5,"I truly feel incredibly fortunate to have met Dr. Annette Ang, who treated my son’s hearing condition. She gave us invaluable advice and created a clear treatment and intervention plan for him. Even within just two visits, she carefully pointed out many important things I should pay attention to, and offered me tremendous encouragement and confidence. Without her, I would have likely fallen into a state of helplessness and negativity.
I’m also deeply grateful to Chelsea at the front desk, who always responded promptly and patiently, helping me sort out all the follow-up matters and allowing me to focus on my son’s care without any worries.
Thank you as well to every staff member at NOBEL ENT—you are all like angels. I feel truly blessed to have found this clinic. Thank you again from the bottom of my heart!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103989600541354181397/reviews
sg sg,5,"Dr Annette and her team are great with adults too! Had a very smooth surgery with her for tonsils and nose at 40 years old. Gentle and patient, Dr Annette addressed all my concerns and I was assured & very well taken care of every step of the way.

Cindy Chua,5,"Kudos to Dr Ang and team. My husband had hearing issues with his left ear and had consulted Dr Ang. Dr Ang is so knowledgable and patient in explaining the possibilities and causes. My husband followed Dr Ang’s recommendations on completing some tests and took some medication. After about 3 weeks, my husband recovered and his hearing is back to normal under Dr Ang’s care. I also wanted to comment on Dr Ang’s staff. Their friendliness and helpful attitude makes visiting the clinic so pleasant. Thank you once again.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115728233345606689921/reviews
