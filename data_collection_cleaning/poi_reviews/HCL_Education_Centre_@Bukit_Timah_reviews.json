      "text": "Classes are getting too crowded even for kindergarten classes. They expect students to make up for classes even in June and December and yet do not have enough make up classes to choose from. How can a student make up for 2-3 classes if they are away for a month during school holidays? They used to accept flight details and would not force students to pay for all holiday classes. However, now all students have to pay regardless of whether they are travelling?  Customer service used to be good but it is getting worse because they do not allow more than 8 students for a makeup class yet do not have alternative dates for make up when we cannot make it for the date and time. What an irony? Definitely more and more money minded.",

      "text": "I would like to thank HCL and my son's HCL teacher, 江老师 for teaching my son this year. He attends P3 Coc class and we have seen a significant improvement in his chinese composition writing. During his recent chinese composition mock test in school, he scored 13/15 ! It was such a pleasant surprise!  He said that it was the same theme that was taught in HCL, hence it was a familiar theme for him to write about. He has learnt a lot from HCL classes and I want to thank 江老师 for the hardwork put into teaching my son :)\n\nI would also like to thank my elder son's HCL teacher, Teacher YuYang for teaching my son and helping him during his Chinese 'O' level preparation. She is patient, encouraging and dedicated. My son scored A1 for his Chinese 'O' level ! :) Very thankful to HCL & Teacher YuYang for seeing him through his last lap for his 'O' level ! :)",
