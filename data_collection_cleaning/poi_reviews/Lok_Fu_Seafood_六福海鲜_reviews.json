      "text": "Chanced upon this zhichar stall inside a coffeeshop along Tanjong Katong road. My parent came here previously and said that the food was not bad. Happened to be around here in the evening and decided to pop by for dinner. There isn't much stalls that were opened when we reached. Not difficult to get a table since there wasn't much people around.\n\nOrdered 3 dishes, sweet and sour pork, stir fried broccoli with garlic and hotplate beancurd. Didn't had to wait long before our food arrived. Food was indeed good. The most outstanding dish definitely has to be the sweet and sour pork. Meat was crispy and the sauce was well balanced. The remaining 2 dishes were equally good as well.\n\nOverall, enjoyed the food and would definitely come back again in the future. Parking wise, might be a little challenging.",

Food here is really good! Tried the fish head steamboat today. Soup is very tasty. Extremely flavourful. Do come and try it out!",
