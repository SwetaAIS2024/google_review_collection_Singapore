Joel Ng,5,"Came during lunchtime so was not crowded. Food was great, drinks were not too sweet. Prawn vermicelli was on the peppery side, squid was cooked well, garlic pork was great, green curry spice was well infused! Thai style orh nee was great as well with a sugary take on it. Very reasonable prices as well! (maybe not the prawn haha)",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107329205925393336778/reviews
Darren,5,"Came by for a celebratory meal as I saw that they sold a wide variety of seafood at an affordable price. They're having a promo for their crabs and we got 2 mud crabs for $48, and topped up $40 for the Tom Yum Mama pot. The pot was chock full of fresh prawns, squid, clams and noodles, though I thought the price was a lil bit steep. Crabs were great and decently sized for the price, and the tomyum soup was on the lighter side (though you can add chilli flakes for a spicier kick!). We also got the sambal kang kong ($12) which was delicious, and Iced Green Milk Tea ($3.50) to wash everything down - pleasantly surprised that the syrup is provided separately so you can dial the sweetness to your liking! Ended off with a Mango Glutinous Rice ($9) which was so good and the mangoes were so sweet, though I felt they could be more generous with the sticky rice. Overall, a great meal at great value, and at a convenient location too! Would definitely return!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews
M. Twinkles,5,"Food was yummy and exceeded expectations! Phad Thai was on point: flavourful, springy noodles and right amount of sauce. Tomyam mama also had flavourful soup. Glad that they use “real prawns” instead of frozen processed prawns.

Green thai milk tea taste better than the rose milk tea. Superb that they separate the sugar syrup so that it’s not too sweet, and diners can adjust based on their liking.

Weekday set lunch is a good deal!

Will b back to try the other dishes!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107670746269540455137/reviews
Lilian Chye,5,"Had a family gathering here.
We ordered:
Lobster mamapot
Papaya salad
Grilled pork neck
Prawn paste chicken wings
Fried seabass with mango dressing
Stir fried kang kong
Mango sticky rice
Ruby dessert

All the food is nice, the mamapot’s soup is a bit salty to take note.

Service is very friendly.
Toilet is very clean.

Overall good experience and my family enjoyed it.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105030433914217824745/reviews
elayna chin,5,"Tasty Thai food with generous servings and fresh ingredients! Went there on a Wednesday night and it was raining, there were only 3 tables occupied at any point of time when we were there. Service staff was super attentive and friendly. Food was flavourful but a little salty for my liking - never realised how parched I was post meal",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105460859948112165491/reviews
