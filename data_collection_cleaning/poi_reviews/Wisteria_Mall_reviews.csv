Renee Lim,3,"I don’t know how an arcade can help us to have more appetite to eat in already a stressful and noise-polluted society like Singapore. Don’t ever eat at the foodcourt here.

This is a mall in the neighbourhood with more and more enrichment services for school- going children and even after school care centres with indoor swimming pool.
A bicycle park with cctv with no smoking, no littering signs and many smokers inside it from the various food delivery services. Best is this bicycle park is facing a childcare centre just opposite the mall on street level. See attached photo- no smoking and 2 guys are smoking there. We can share the mall, the parking lots but you can keep your smoke to yourselves.

Update: 23 Feb 2025
So much for the management reply. Look at the latest video footage of action (if any taken) post reply. The bicycle park is the openly approved (guarded by cctv) smoking point.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118192190047460723084/reviews
Shina,4,"This mall is quite basic, with not much to offer in terms of shopping or entertainment. However, it does have a NTUC finest for convenience and a few food options like KFC, Long John, Subway, Pizza Hut, if you’re looking for a quick bite. It’s a decent spot for essentials but not really a place to spend much time.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107018165265701590994/reviews
張若惟,2,A mall with high convenience but very bad air quality. The toilets and elevator entrances are smelly. B1 sells fried food and smells like oil smoke. My children often feel uncomfortable when attending classes there.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104624567694343759159/reviews
Dan Ho,3,"New neighbourhood mall that has a condo integrated to it in Yishun. Nothing fantastic, few simple shops. I visited it in a weekday lunchtime and there were barely any people in the restaurants
And food court. I guess it gets more crowded in the evening. There’s a supermarket and Kopitiam Food courts carpark is situated on upper levels.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117612630125288267206/reviews
