Luiz Lee,4,"After many years, managed to try their Black Pepper crab again, pepper taste still the same but their chilli crab is not as nice.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108105162226071877247/reviews
Teresa Chu,5,"A cozy local coffee shop like place. Their Black pepper crab is the most delicious Black Pepper Crab I ever had in Singapore. I personally think it is the best in town, their sauce is very unique, a little bit of sweetness that you don’t taste the bitter from black pepper like other famous touristy restaurants.  Must try menu are black pepper crab, fried dough fritter with sotong, and fried bee hoon.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116273895887926651924/reviews
Sophiachia,2,"I was looking forward to eating pepper crab after not coming to Eng Seng for a few years. Something has had changed though. It was no longer packed with diners. Even though only half of the tables were taken, we waited almost an hour for the crab dish. In the past, we were always served the dishes very fast. A check at the kitchen showed the chef was idle, not busy cooking dishes to be delivered. I won’t come back again after this experience. The price of a crab cost about $80. Not quite worth the price and experience.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101269373073958960648/reviews
Skye Cai,4,"The seafood crabs are a little over priced.
Ordered both the male and the female types of crabs.
The male is cooked with black pepper. The meats are fresh and junky.
The claws are huge and filled with meat. The black pepper is a little spicy.
The chilli crab sauce is a little too sweet. Good to dip with the fried man tou.
Vegetables are fresh. A little over priced.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Angie Tang,1,"If u enjoy crab meat with less than 1/5 filled ,do try this place. Order crab worth 300 plus but greeted with lousy watery crab.

Feedback to the store, they blame it on the supplier.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105379643283046475289/reviews
