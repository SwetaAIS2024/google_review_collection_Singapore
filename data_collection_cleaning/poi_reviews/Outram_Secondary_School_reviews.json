They have a swimming pool up on the slopes, where the diving association PADI has a space meant for weekend pool sessions, as part of the certification process. It's not fantastically convenient, with busses and grab cars readily available, but is a short distance away from the train station. Not the cleanest pool around but gets the job done for sure.",
