Victoria L.,5,"Very peaceful, clean and well maintained. I enjoyed the scenery and the fair amount of shades and resting points. There were beautiful wildlife to explore and observe on the way. There were clean toilets too! Great short walk for a 1-2 hour walk!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109397614320532390057/reviews
Travis Kelly,5,"Definitely one of the better areas to walk around here. We got to experience lots of wildlife and got some great pictures. Itâ€™s gets very windy when you are close to the coast but overall, definitely worth a visit.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100868867239282273789/reviews
Alice Lim,5,"My 2-year-old granddaughter & I went there for a walk recently. It was a sunny day. The sea water splashing against the rocks soothed & lulled her, she almost dozed off. The little one was so happy to see many roosters, hens, chickens, and squirrels, and we heard birds chirping. We saw a beautiful peacock out on parade!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105277272557459579361/reviews
Ivanna W,5,"The walkway is wider and all flat after the revamp. Walking there with my toddler on a stroller is nice. Lots of birds, chickens, occasionally you can see the resident peacock roaming around too.

Some monkeys were spotted too when I visited on 12.02.25",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117422612191677321157/reviews
Andre Karl Misso,4,"A lovely historical site to bring your dog for a walk, go for a run or just sit and watch the sea. Be mindful that the heat of the day will change your experience. I was there when it was cloudy and it was cooler.

A few historical points to view. I could walk my dog along the park but there was a sign that disallowed pets up the hill.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104188194322810086220/reviews
