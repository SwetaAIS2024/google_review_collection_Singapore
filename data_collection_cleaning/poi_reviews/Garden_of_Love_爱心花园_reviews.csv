Jonah Wong,5,"Absolutely loved this small garden! It's the perfect spot for a peaceful escape. The layout is neat and tidy, with well-maintained plants and flowers. Despite its compact size, the space feels refreshing and inviting. Best of all, no mosquitoes to worry about, which makes it even more enjoyable for a relaxing time outdoors. A hidden gem thatâ€™s beautifully cared for.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117783879841446464476/reviews
