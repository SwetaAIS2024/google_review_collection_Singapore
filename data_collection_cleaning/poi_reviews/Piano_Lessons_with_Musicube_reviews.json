All in all, I was with her since I was in primary school until my college years. She is ever  patient with me, which I think it is the best virtue any teacher ought to have, and will point out any blunders with my playing and correct them accordingly.\n\nThank you, Ms Koh, for the wonderful years of imparting your musical skills to me. I really did not regret taking up music as a side hobby as I have moved on to self-learn the violin, and as of late, the drums as well.\n\nMusic has become part of my life. Thank you!",

She is very friendly and open towards her students to make them feel at ease, while also willing to give necessary critisicm when needed, something which was not present from my previous teachers. Her teaching has opened my eyes to how classical music can be played and intepreted to express certain emotions effectively, and I've learned a lot of techniques on how I can improve my piano playing as well.",
