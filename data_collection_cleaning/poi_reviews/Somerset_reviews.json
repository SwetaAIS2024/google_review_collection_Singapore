      "text": "Somerset MRT station is a very interesting set up, being one station away from Orchard, and Dhoby Ghaut. It's home to the many malls that have flourished around here, all strung up by the underground walk ways.\n\nStation has been around for a long time, yet it's still clean and very well maintained. The station also connects to the many Bus Stations that you'd likely need to transit at.\n\nPersonally I like to leverage Somerset as a slightly strategic place to transit, given the many sheltered walkways they have established, so whether rain or shine, you'll have protection getting from place to place.",

H&M's flagship store and Pan Pacific are also nearby this station.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, alight at this station and take a stroll towards Dhoby Ghaut or Orchard MRT to enjoy the sight and sounds of Singapore's shopping district!",
