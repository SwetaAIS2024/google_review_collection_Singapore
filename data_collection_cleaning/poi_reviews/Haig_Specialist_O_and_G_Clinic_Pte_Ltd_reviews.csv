Jen Gg,2,I m really surprised about the super good rating this place gets. My experience as a first time user was super different. Felt ero empathy zero care I was in and out in less than 2min. A Gp would probably have done a better job. Only good thing is efficiency for booking.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103693883460663565787/reviews
Hazel Lim,5,"First chanced upon Haig O&G, and visited them because of their prompt responsiveness to my enquiry and reasonable charges.

Clinic is easy to get to, a short walk from Eunos mrt.

Dr Umesh is a very fatherly, cute and caring physician with many years of professional experience. I feel very safe in his hands.

And his Receptionists Leah and Clinic assistants, nurses work like a family together.

The level of service is like visiting your family physicians whom you know and trust well.
Haig O&G is my choice for all things gynae.

Thank you Doctor and staff.
You guys are the best! :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108147928610404683437/reviews
