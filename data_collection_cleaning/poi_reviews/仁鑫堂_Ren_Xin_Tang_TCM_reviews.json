      "text": "I recently had a bone setting session with Kelvin and was genuinely impressed by his professionalism and skill. From the start, he took the time to understand my concerns and explained the process thoroughly, which helped me feel at ease.\n\nKelvin's technique is precise and confident — you can tell he has deep knowledge of body mechanics and alignment. During the session, he addressed areas of stiffness and discomfort I had been struggling.\n\nAfter the session, I felt a noticeable improvement in my posture, reduced tension in my lower back and neck, and greater mobility overall.\n\nHighly recommend Kelvin if you're looking for an experienced and effective bone setting therapist who truly understands the body. I’ll definitely be returning for follow-up sessions.",

While slightly uncomfortable during adjustments, the results were immediate—I felt relaxed and more mobile. The clinic was clean and welcoming. Highly recommended for pain relief and overall well-being!",

Consultant Mr. New Chin Ker was extremely patient and knowledgeable, offering a straightforward diagnosis without any gimmicks and gave me advices like a caring dad.\n\nAfter acupuncture, I proceeded to the bone setting, handled by Michael. All I can say is, don't worry, you are in good hands. He knows what he is doing and doesn't yank it out for the sake of it. He ensures that you relax and then slowly loosens your joints.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience. There was no hard selling, just an honest diagnosis.",
