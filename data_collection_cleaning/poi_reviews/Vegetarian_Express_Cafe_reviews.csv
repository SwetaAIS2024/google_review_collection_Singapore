Pat K,4,Ordered the mock chicken rice. Everything was decent tasting and chilli was good. If there was soup to accompany the dry rice would have been better.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118285938537609278774/reviews
Jo K.,5,"Update 8 Nov 24
Brightened atmosphere now with new lighting. Food just as good. Staff seem happier too.

Bought some snacks from the counter - the Pumpkin Cracker from Malaysia is superb $4 and the Monkey Head Mushroom floss from Taiwan $7 is good too (but I couldn‚Äôt see the use by date on the packaging)

Update 2 Jan 24
Fantastic dinner with ‚Äúfish‚Äùcurry and ‚Äúchicken‚Äù rice (they ran out of the chicken rice but we totally enjoyed the unpolished rice option!)

There was a notice to seek support for price increase due to rental increase. The shop lease expires Nov 24. Support! Support!! I hope they will endure and  stay on!

Cash, nets and paylah accepted!

Update 28 Aug 23

Monday 530pm. Called to order for self pick up. When I arrived after 10 min, it was ready!!!
The food is still as reliable as ever.

We had for $31.60:
1. fish curry is 5/5 looks fierce but not that spicy, just spicy enough!
2. Luo Han Zhai - think it‚Äôs the best 5/5. Vege is adequately crunchy yet cooked to soak jn the delicious sauce.
3. Olive fried rice - the rice was slightly lumpy and could be dryer.

Paid by pay now on-site (other options: nets or cash)

Can‚Äôt believe I haven‚Äôt reviews this cafe! Probably cos I don‚Äôt want people crowding the already crowded space. These guys are simply great!!!!

Super reliable in quality and can eat in Aircon comfort. But there is limited seating so if u are late u can wait.

Chu-Fung Lim,3,"Food: Not worth the value honestly. The ingredients are too simple and the taste like dilute with water.

Service: Can feel they are rushing you to finish the food due to limited seats.

Atmosphere: The chair is not comfortable and very small space.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104411254580634652075/reviews
