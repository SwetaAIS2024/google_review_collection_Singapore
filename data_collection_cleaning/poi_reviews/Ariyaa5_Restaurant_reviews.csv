Josephine Tang,5,"Simply yummilicious! Authentic traditional way of Indian cooking. High quality cooking standard with reasonable price.

Present your Ariyaa's pamphlet and you shall be able to a get discount and perks.

This is a ""Must Try"" restaurant that hidden in the neighbourhood, the hidden gem. Hope they can maintain the consistency of the food standard from time to time!ðŸ˜‰",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111333226180614624597/reviews
Wilson Lee,5,"Price pretty decent at a neighborhood setting, food definitely tasty especially the curry fish head (fresh and donâ€™t have to wait long). Service staff are patient and will teach you how to eat certain snacks should you require. Atmosphere clean and definitely a good place to chill.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107224278715441101875/reviews

Teng Yan Wen,5,"Absolutely recommend people staying nearby to visit!

Food tastes great, place is air conditioned, and price is reasonable.

The briyani portion is quite big and always comes with an egg. Mee goreng was average and bit oily. Roti prata (w & w/o egg) tastes great. Teh tarik was good too, you can ask for less sweet if you like but the normal sugar level feels alright for me. Blueberry drink feels like blueberry syrup and yogurt (not sure), nice too.

They are having some promotion now based on their flyer. Come and have a try! Will definitely visit more often.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106243166814153638950/reviews
Cherie Tan,4,"Ate here more than once. Came back mainly to take photos of menu. Best thing about the place is service. Staff are patient and attentive. Atmosphere is alright, considering thereâ€™s always families with young children making noise in an enclosed air conditioned space

Bought the same dishes and can say the taste is not consistent. First visit the naan was crispy even after 20min, visit after was a big difference. Less than a few minutes after and the naan was already soft. Mutton was much spicier, curry was a lot oilier and there was 50% more rice too",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104868350487944484414/reviews
