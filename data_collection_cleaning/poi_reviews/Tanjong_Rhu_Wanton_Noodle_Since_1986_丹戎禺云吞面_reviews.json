      "text": "Wanton Noodles, Dry ($4.50) – 6/10\nThe noodles were springy and thicker than usual, coated in a black soy sauce that had a slight sweetness. The char siew was lean and thinly sliced, but it lacked the tenderness and flavor to stand out. The wantons had smooth skins but were on the thicker side. A decent meal, but not one I’d return for.\n\nDumpling Soup ($5) – 7/10\nThe soup was delicious, with a clean, savory flavor, and 4 generously stuffed dumplings. Each of the four dumplings was filled with a flavorful mix of prawns and crunchy water chestnuts, offering a satisfying bite.",

Ordered dumpling soup today $5 for 4 pieces generously filled dumpling with prawn in every piece with a thin layer of skin really yummy. Don't really like this hawker here as many crows, hard to find seating and plates at tray return not cleared promptly.",

Opted for the $5.5 version wanton Mee with chilli.\n\nReally springy noodles, generous ingredients such as bok choy, sliced pork, fried wantons and wantons. The chilli goes so well with the noodles, really liked it!",
