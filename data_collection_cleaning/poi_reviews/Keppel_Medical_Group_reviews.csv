Farhana,5,"Came here for a consultation on a whim as the clinic I usually go to in Telok Blangah had a long waiting time, but it turned out be a great decision as the receptionists and doctor (Dr Aloysius) were warm and friendly.

Waiting time was decent (there were a few patients ahead of me), but itâ€™s a lot better when compared to neighbouring clinics. Will change my go-to clinic to Keppel Medical from now on.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105946484472503032534/reviews
FRANCIS HENG,5,"Highly impressed with the high standard of care and service par excellence of this clinic.  Just visited the clinic for a routine blood test but ended with a thorough review of overall heath status and a recurring sinus problem.  Dr. Soh is a caring doc who will always take time to give a thorough explanation of my condition as well as offer suggestions for self-care.  His staff members are also highly efficient, helpful and caring.  I have witnessed them going beyond their call of duties to reach out to the elderly and other vulnerable patients.  I may add that their charges are very reasonable.  Keep it up and all the best!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118370512068141646654/reviews
Dawn Ho,1,"Terrible service. Came at 10am to register myself for a doctor's appointment. The receptionist said "" it's a long wait"" puts my name down, gives me a sticker with number 38 on it and says ""come back around 12pm"".

I get in at 1155am. 5 patients go in front of me... 40,41, 42..  I keep asking the receptionist, who blatantly let's these other patients go ahead, ""excuse me why is everyone going ahead of me when I registered so much earlier? "".

She said ""the next one, I told the doctor already "". *beep* number 45 goes in.

What on earth? How disrespectful of their patients time. Terribly disorganised.

Apparently it wasn't the resident doctor and her team on duty that day. Still it wasn't a good experience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114853053932346019316/reviews
Chris Chin,1,"My Bad experience was encountered after seeing the doctor for asking for a recovery memo, due to overseas requirements, guess what they want to charge me $50 for that memo, I walk out from the clinics and call MOH and find out is
free. I logged a complaint and hopefully MOH steps into for investigation.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108029010914686664769/reviews
