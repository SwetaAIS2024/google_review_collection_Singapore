Alex Haley,1,"Interesting experience. Went there, asked for help to fix up my barely used bike. Was assured it was a small issue and the boss uncle’s famous last words was “不用钱！你的问题就是我的问题！包在我身上”。😯 He was very friendly and asked how I found his shop. I said I googled and saw some negative reviews but I trust the experience of experienced tradesman who knows what they are doing! I also declined the free offer and said I’d pay. Anyway I was told he needed time to assess the bike and fix it so I can come back the next day for collection.

Cue next day. Received a call and was told that the screw was secured poorly and he couldn’t open it. Claims parts were crooked and faulty and needed replacement. I asked for the price. “$145”. ??? I was shocked to say the least and replied I’d dump the relatively cheap bike then. “Oh then you give me the bike and leave it here lah, I slowly fix it”. 😒 No uncle??? Why should I give you my barely used bike?

I said no need to fix and went down to collect the bike. It was already placed outside the shop. Out of courtesy for his time, I walked into the shop to pass the uncle $15 as a token sum and he took the money, barely entertaining me. I walked out and collected my bike, only to notice that the brake cable was cut broken!!! What the hell.

In utter disbelief I turned to chatty to ask if it was salvageable. $5-10 for a replacement cable! 😤

Googled another bike repair shop (C**) a couple of streets away. Was quoted $40 to fix the bike. Collected it the next day. That was all I asked for when I took time to come here in the first place. For a fair quote for a proper job done.

Looking at other reviews for this place, it’s either a hit or miss. If you enjoy some drama in your life, come at your own peril. 🙄",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111060860851900851295/reviews
Benny Khoo,5,"Visited this shop without much expectation. I was warmly welcome with a chatty uncle who accepted the kid bike brake issue.

This is considered as small job which most pro bike shop won't fix as it doesn't justify their man hours.

Thankful such services still being offered by bike repair uncles regardless quality of the bicycle.

Kid bike is fix with a minimal fee. Appreciate it.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102647998622116491537/reviews
Yu Kok Lim,5,Sent my kids bike to change of tyre. Fix it with resonable price without much hassle.

Zen,5,"I had an issue with my bicycle that I just couldn’t figure out, so I decided to bring it to Uncle who was recommended by my friend. Unlike other shops that either over-quote or refuse to help, Uncle took the time to inspect my bike and quickly identified the problem. The service was fast and thorough and Uncle even took the time to explain what he did.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114832434229999170444/reviews
Froilan Bulaong,5,"Uncle was great as he fix my creaking sound coming from my Bike’s drivetrain, I already tried to cleanup up and put some grease on my pedal but still the sound persist, I have no tools like what they have in the bike shop, but uncle manage to find the creaking sound culprit and just tighten that thing on my picture and the creaking sound was removed. By the way they also accept PayNow and Google Pay.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118424748176033287166/reviews
