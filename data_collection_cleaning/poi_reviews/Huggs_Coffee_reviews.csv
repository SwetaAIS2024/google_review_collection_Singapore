khrhms,4,Trying out all the coffee spots in the Cecil area. This one gets a 4 star rating. The iced kopi o less sweet was what I wanted for a pre work out drink. Service from the two ladies were friendly and my drink was ready in less than 5 minutes. Nice area to sit and people watch. Seems like a popular spot for those cbd people to grab a quick cup of coffee too. No complains.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
Tanira K,5,"One of my fav coffee spots in SG. Reasonably priced drinks, nice vibe and I appreciate that the oat options are front and centre. Their coffee is great but what is unique is their tea and masala tea - both with oat milk options! Sooo delicious

They have clearly marked their dairy free options and their food items also have allergens written on them which is uncommon in SG. Not a massive vegan selection for food but there usually is 1 wrap at least thatâ€™s vegan friendly. Only complaint is that sometimes they use plastic cups for cold drinks even when dining in. Would be good to use glass where possible #endsingleuseplastic. #veganfriendly",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117656998976288081886/reviews
YY,3,"Came here for a coffee catch up and do note that it gets really humid as it's not air conditioned. Teh C Kosong was a tad milky, and will probably try the hot chocolate next time.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
Apex Predator,1,A place to avoid for Matcha Latte. Premixed matcha with sugar in powdered form and getting charged $7.5 for it for a small cup. Ridiculously priced. Definitely not a place for matcha.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107440203793024913829/reviews
Mohammed Aamir Mitha,5,"My team and I have been going here every morning for the last 6ish months and love it, this is our go to coffee shop every morning to get our daily fix of quality coffee (and on occasion breakfast wraps). The coffee is fresh, hot and delicious and the staff are very friendly (and remember us + our orders). I usually have their Americano where my colleagues have their Kopi. Lately I have been eating their turkey ham and cheese wrap and I am addicted. If you are in the Tanjong Pagar area come and try them out, you won't regret it!!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103141119098499649893/reviews
