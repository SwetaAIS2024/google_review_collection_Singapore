      "text": "Exceptionally good service.\nWas hesitant upon reading the reviews about horrible service.  However, the next prata place is a distance away.  So, I decided to take the chance and mine! Am I impressed!\nEveryone was smiley, including the diners. We were seated immediately like in a restaurant - not something I would expect of a corner coffeshop.  Menu was brought to us  quickly.   Dishes was served with a smile and \"Enjoy your meal!\".  Everything was fast and efficient from  placing order and paying to the serving of dishes.\n\nCheese prata is excellent.  Crispy n tasty shredded cheddar cheese.  Maggie goreng is good.  Curry fish is ok.\n\nAtmosphere is a dark tone like a \"bar\" feel.  Modern pendant lamps.  Clean tables.  Toilets need some work though.\n\nWill come again for sure.",
