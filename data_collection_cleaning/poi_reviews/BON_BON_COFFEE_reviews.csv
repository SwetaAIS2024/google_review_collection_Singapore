littlebitofnoms,5,"Love the Matcha Latte and Leaf Pie, they go so well together! The Matcha Latte is not too sweet with medium matcha intensity, and sweetened slightly with their delicious whipped foam. The Daily Coffee is pretty good too, with their special blend. Would recommend for anyone in the area looking for a short coffee break. I‚Äôd love to try the Matcha Affogato next!!

Oh, by the way I love the sando ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Sooo good ü§åü§åü§å must try!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105189557995353438074/reviews
Jet Chew,5,"Wanted some specialty coffee after lunch at CentrePoint and was delighted to have discovered this cosy little spot run by a group of friendly Japanese folks.

They have a select range of pour-over coffee to choose from - from single origin light roast to the classic dark Japanese blends. I had an iced Kilimanjaro single origin light roast, which they brewed for me using a Simplify dripper.

This is also a great spot to shop for coffee equipment - drippers, kettles, coffee cups and bottles from brands like Kono, Origami, Hario, Timemore.

Will return for more the next time I‚Äôm in Singapore!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102371075035901570828/reviews
