      "text": "I have been buying from this outlet for more than 10 years so it‚Äôs a kind of neighborhood store for me but I would like to share an incident that happened that. I wanted to get a cup noodle. Small $1.75 and big $1.85. I would usually just get the small one but I saw a promo 2 for $2.95 for the big ones. It‚Äôs a no brainer I get them as this is what promo is for. But the self check out counter registered $3.70 and luckily I saw and asked the cashier.  She went to the aisle to check and asked if it‚Äôs the wrong brand wrong dates‚Ä¶ Nope they added up. Then she brought the 2 cup noodles to another cashier colleague to key in and the same thing happened and all this while they keep saying it‚Äôs the wrong price. Meaning their system is correct and mine is wrong despite the label. I had a similar incident a couple of years back in Canada and the cashier ‚Äòcheerfully‚Äô gave me the item for free. I am not after a free item. But it is sad that our working force is so rigid and failed to want to see from a customer point of view. The tag is there, the dates are correct. Someone forgot to key in the system. So why are you telling us your issue? We like to employ aunties and uncles to the front end job. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I am an uncle myself now. But what I feel is that the management of Giant need to have a renewed thinking and maybe it‚Äôs time they let the young people take over as there is a saying in Chinese if the top is ‚Äòuncle‚Äô the bottom also think like ‚Äòuncles‚Äô.",

Where theres still a long q waiting to pay.\nI din notice the cashier has packed the minced pork meat together with the pineapple juice? I hope this can be improve by knowing raw meats need to be pack separately.\nThe only good point I believe is 24hrs and tat it.",
