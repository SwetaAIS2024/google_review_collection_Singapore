Dawn Lim,4,"Value for money, above average tasting food that is not too salty.

I ordered a chicken feet horfun medium ($5) and a small dumpling soup ($4) with extra veggies ($1). The portions were generous. And the food, while not spectacular, was tasty enough.

They used to sell their noodles at $3 (small), $4 (medium), $5 (large), which was really good value. But I guess inflation got to them too. So, prices are now $4/$5/$6.

Still, I would say the stall owners don't scrimp on what they offer. You can see how much extra veggies they gave me on top of my dumpling soup.

Will come again when I'm in the area and feel like wantan or chicken feet noodles.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113563695447323499189/reviews
Desmond Wong,3,"The wanton mee tasted normal at this coffee shop. It was not fantastic, I prefer the one at block 23 sin Ming. The noodles seems a little overcooked and does not have the bouncy taste. Also the chill and soup was okay only.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114220117023892689160/reviews
E Chen,3,"I don’t know why this place has such good ratings. I rarely meet a wanton I don’t like and this really isn’t good. The wanton skin is not nice, the wanton meat is not flavourful. The only good thing about it is that it’s not salty. Even my school canteen had better wanton",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103406456910600324103/reviews
Lim Keyi,5,"I like how the wanton taste be it fried or cooked, there's a fragrance to the dry wanton mee which makes eating much more yummier. I like how their chicken feet taste as well, very unique as they fried it unlike other stalls",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106599949548498410920/reviews
M P,3,It’s slightly above average wanton noodles. Can try but not worth to travel,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112908652574347918174/reviews
