It not only provides career opportunities but also galvanized their confidence, build up teamwork and leadership skills and further shaping their personalities.\nIndeed, Professor Brawn Cafe chain restaurants is an innovative approach to help challenging individuals merge into our society without being sidelined.\nMy rating is a 5 out of 5 for the food, the atmosphere, the customer service level, the warm hospitality and most importantly, the cause for which this restaurant chain stands for. Oh, also an ex-Executive Chef who worked in a 5 star hotel at your service. What more can you ask for? üòÑ",

      "text": "Love this new cafe in Tampines. Spacious with great ambience and air conditioned. Service is great! Tried their v day menu which comes with a cod fish main, lobster bisque and a rose dessert. Also ordered their clams in butter sauce and fish and chips separately. All dishes are prepared beautifully and tasted good. Will be excellent if they can ensure there are no bones in the cod fish. Surprising they also serve gong cha selected drinks! There is also an art shop within the same space where you can shop for items made by local artists before or after your meal. The meal ended with a surprise sweet gift from the restaurant - a stalk of beautiful big red rose on v day!",

      "text": "Situated inside a school, this restaurant serves mainly Western food and Gong Cha with a limited selection. We ordered the Caesar salad, soft-shell crab spaghetti, and steak. The salad was good, but one thing puzzled me: we added an extra portion of vegetables, expecting them to be included in the salad, but they were served as a side dish instead.\n\nThe steak was cooked to a good temperature but could have been perfect if it weren‚Äôt under-seasoned. The soft-shell crab was disappointing‚Äîthe crab was very tough, and the pasta‚Äôs seasoning was lackluster. Price-wise, it‚Äôs not very cheap, but 60% of the profits go to the needy. Ultimately, I will visit again in the future to try other dishes.",

On-site supervisor was able to guide the trainees how best to communicate and serve the customers.\n\nAs for my pepper allergy, chef William went on an extra mile to make sure it was free from pepper. Really salute to the team's effort. Keep it up. I have been recommending this cafe to others üòç",
