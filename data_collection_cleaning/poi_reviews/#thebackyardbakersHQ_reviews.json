They are super indulgent, moist, and perfect for those who like their chocolate dark and with in-your-face level of richness.\n\nI tried the chewy fudge brownies today and could only get through less than 1/3 of it - will save the rest for another day! It‚Äôs just pure, premium chocolatey goodness. Best shared because it really packs a punch.\n\nThe banana bread is also a must-try, and constantly sold out. Pre-ordering in advance would be the safest bet!",

Still the Valrhona dark chocolate with sea salt is my favorite. Can‚Äôt go wrong with it.\n\nNot cheap as 4 pieces easily sets your back with S$30+ as each diff flavor has a different price tag.\n\nYet to try out their other food items.\n\nWill be back for more but can‚Äôt be a daily affair. Else I need to worth extra hard to shed those calories.",

I can safely say that their mala options, herbivore are yummy and have kept the standard.\n\nOn my most recent visit, I decided to try their otah and I was blown away by how generous they were in the otah serving and how yummy it was.\n\nTheir brookies and muffins blows my chocolate loving soul off. üëçüèº",
