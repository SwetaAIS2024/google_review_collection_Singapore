Sook Neo,5,"Since 2009, Team Jackie and Tan has been servicing our home aircon on an annual contract basis.  They are efficient, professional and able to give prompt advice and keep our aircon in tip top condition.

Recently, Jackie went the extra mile in helping to clear out the outdoor compressor area where birds were creating quite a problem, blocking up the compressor.

The support staff at the office is also very helpful and gives timely reminders to get our aircon serviced. Thank you, All Best, for your good service.üëç",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106407670966068001806/reviews
