      "text": "Perfect! Came for Iftar for three timessss becoz the service is super tiptop and the owner and the waiters are so super nice and kind and polite. I didn‚Äôt make mistakes for choosing this place for Iftar unlike the place that I went for Iftar in pontian (D TAMBAK CORNER- very POOR services with very BAD attitude from the owner and workers). So blessed to get a great Iftar in nenda plates. Kudos to the owner! May you have more rizq in your life for being such a good person ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä my husband lovessssss the food here so much! Hahah",

The food presentation doesn't look appealing however the once sip of the kuah, u will never stop. My kids finish up their maggi goreng special. They even ask for another plate. Extremely recommended for those who like to try out different makan place",

      "text": "I stumbled upon this gem for lunch and decided to give it a try based on decent reviews. The extensive menu offered plenty of choices, but I went for the ayam penyet and claypot chicken asam pedas. Both dishes were fantastic! The ayam penyet was crispy and served with a complete set, including a flavorful soup. The claypot chicken was bursting with tangy goodness. The portions were generous, and the prices were very affordable. Even the drinks were refreshing. Overall, the food was fresh and delicious‚Äîdefinitely a spot I‚Äôll revisit!",
