Ng _Tan,1,It says that it's open now from 6 to 9pm but it's closed even at 719pm.!! Worse is they don't even leave any msg to say if they will open or not! Ridiculous! Very mean to make us sick people wait so long outside their clinic for so long... Hoping that we cd actually see a doc. ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜•,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115867046147151622267/reviews

Subhadra Mukherjee,5,I am very happy with this clinic. The doctors are knowledgeable and explain well and the wait time is not long. They accept my Great Eastern insurance. The doctors here have solved many issues for us which specialists were no use for.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111697395698872501268/reviews
Felicia Wong,3,"Clinic nurses are polite and helpful. Dr Adrian Poh is professional and care to explain the condition to patient. However, I came across Dr Lu Xiao Meng. In my opinion, she is very unprofessional and one of the worst doctors around. She did not bother checking on the patient thoroughly and gave a very vague diagnosis. I probably can get more advice from google or even the clinic nurse than from this particular doctor. Please do check on the doctor on duty before going.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111610237873778676236/reviews
Dream,1,"Worst clinic ever. They don't know what they do. During my consultation, I was asked to get some tests done and I was told that your blood report can be covered through cashless under your policy if fasting and asked me to come back in 2 days and then after giving blood through all needles for reports, they call and say now we can not cover it. I don't understand why people would waste time effort and energy. Nonsense. Don't waste your time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114523059956544545169/reviews
