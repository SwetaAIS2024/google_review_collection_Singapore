      "text": "My photo will explain everything.......just look at the queue!!!\nRun by Mr Choi & wife from HK now a citizen,\nStalls is open 358 days (except the market washing days every 3 mths & CNY )rain or shine .\nHardworking & chatty but not during rush hour ! ü§£ Rich thick coffee & tea at $1.30 is what I enjoyed . As Mr Choi is from Hong Kong theirÈ∏≥È∏Ø is good too !  Lemon tea & sugar cane with lemon is nice & freshing too ! No price increase from them , trying hard to keep things affordable as there lots of retirees and old people living in this area.I am one of them staying in this area for 40 years.\nCome & try it , if you are in the neighborhood.\nAs 2 coffee a day keeps the doctor away !\nMr Choi is always funny & entertaining  !!! He hires senior citizens to help out at his stores. So exercise understanding & patience especially during lunch time.As it works for some not for others .\nStall opens at 8:30am daily for business.\nLongest queue in the market besides the wanton noodles stall ! Look at the photo attached.\n\nRead some of his reviews earlier don't think they are fair ! Not taking sides but Communication is always 2 ways ..........some reviewers said not worth the price ....but they are already the cheapest coffee stall in the market  .\nSome said poor service .......there is a sign written at their stall that says self service ! ü§£\n\nBe clear in your order be it take away or consume there especially during peak hour.\nAnd don't give people 10x5 cents coins lah !\nAging population my friends both local & foreigners so be patient when dealing with the seniors !\n\nYou go YaKun pay $7 for toast eggs & coffee also self service lah ! Kpkb for what ? Not your cup of tea drink once & that's it !\nÂΩì‰Ω†ËßâÂæóÂÖ®‰∏ñÁïåÈÉΩ‰∏çÂ¶•ÁöÑËØù!\nÈÇ£ÈóÆÈ¢ò‰∏ÄÂÆöÊòØ‰Ω†ËÄå‰∏çÊòØÂÖ®‰∏ñÁïå !\nUpdated 6 May 2025 last photo.",

When I cracked the egg, I realised that it was overcooked for way to long and it was already hard boiled. I showed the owner the state of the egg and kindly requested if I could change it. Instead of apologising for his mistake of leaving the egg in the water too long, he hid behind his lie saying that‚Äôs how he normally cooks it. He was actually having a set of soft boiled eggs in front of me. Definitely DO NOT BUY FROM this stall.",
