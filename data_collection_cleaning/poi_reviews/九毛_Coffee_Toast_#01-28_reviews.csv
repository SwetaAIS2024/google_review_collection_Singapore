Matti Lepp√§nen,5,Excellent kaya toast set for a very reasonable price (S$3.80 for butter kaya set). Fast and friendly service.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101302754477090512693/reviews
Rachel W,3,There's something sweet and granular in the kaya toast like sprinkled sugar which doesn't suit my taste. The butter is also not salty enough. Eggs are done well though. And stall looks clean. Is it really open 24hours?,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114414640853999095838/reviews
