G Wong (Foodbiz101),4,"NTU food court 14, a canteen for nearby students staying at school hostel. 6 stalls only. Noodle, Rice, Western (newly open), Japanese, mix (I not sure cos they selling Thai and Mala‚Ä¶?)

Heard that the dry noodle is good. But I came here for the western food, the portion is big (good! cos I‚Äôm so hungry) student pricing :) chicken is juicy, taste is good.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117102433989828998045/reviews
Cheow Mong Chan,5,"Canteen with good food. So far tried Ban Mian, Western and Jap (Menya Takashi), all served food that is cheap and good. Came on 2 Saturdays and not much of a crowd",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116936834742186304043/reviews
Nicholas Tan,5,"I rarely review food court stalls due to their generic food that can be found elsewhere.

BUT why I am reviewing this is due to the fact there is an amazing store here that I feel I need to share with everyone and the fact this place is pretty isolated.

The Dry Ban Mian Store is just simply put AMAZING. I tried their Dry Ramen and there no words describing how good it is. It is simply restaurant standards and the tanginess of the noodles and flavouring in their sauce just made me wordless at first bite. I also added abit of chilli on my first trying and for my second trying I added more to make my ramen spicy. But you can perfectly eat it without chilli as well.

The soup version is just ok as well but not as nice as the dry.

Considering the affordable price (refer to picture), this stall is a must vist.

There is also a Japanese store. (Refer to image) The food is pretty ex for a food court. $6 and above minimally but it's not bad. No wow factor but decent.

Western food is halal. Decent cream spaghetti but abit tough chicken chop.

The food court opened at 11am daily and closes at 8pm.

There's parking nearby. Or you can always just take public transport.

Food court is non-airconditioned.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107476272064371233871/reviews
Skye Cai,4,"Jia Xiu Wei Dao this Chinese noodle store one of the best Chinese style noodle that is within NTU.
Tried the mutton trotter, it‚Äôs stewed for long, very tender and juicy. Soup is not salty and filled with collagen.
Added beef tripe that‚Äôs for additional $4.
Little over price though.
But very satisfied with the noodle.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
