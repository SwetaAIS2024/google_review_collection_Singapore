MightyFoodie,4,The broth is quite flavourful and aromatic but Prawns are not really that fresh fresh. Overall still a decent bowl of Prawn mee,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117758726090524211857/reviews
Alvin Choo,4,"Tried their lor mee a couple of times but didn't leave a review. Recently saw some discussion on lor mee and one of the recommendation was this same stall, but their hougang branch.

The lor has a herbal profile which I really liked. It's also full of fried fish and braised pork slices, as well as half an egg. All this for $5 (Oct 2024).

Would recommend to give them a try.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
D L,5,"$4.50 prawn mee. The dry version is nice.  Tossed in a chilli paste sauce that packs a bit of a spice punch. Quite rich. The pork slices are really tender yet chewy. Prawns are fresh. Soup is nice but I think I prefer the dry version. Mee pok is nice too.

Now $5",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104966613744701231932/reviews
Grace Teo,5,Really love their prawn mee. Been eating here for some time and always Âä†Êñô for one dollar. Comes quite generous with the meat and prawns. The broth also very solid. Overall this wins the Joo Chiat Prawn mee hands down at Ayer rajah food centre for me. üëçüèª,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111089865023760144728/reviews
Sean Goh,3,"Happened to be around Clementi west, initially wanted to try the porridge stall from the same coffeeshop however they were already closed for the day. Noticed there is a stall on the opposite end of the coffeeshop selling prawn noodle  and lor mee and decided to give it a try. I believe they have a few branches in Singapore. Price of the noodle starts from SGD$4 onward.

I had their fried fish lor mee, it came with the standard ingredient of braised egg, pork belly and fried fish. As i opted out the pork belly, i was given slightly more fried fish. Gravy was has nice consistency. flavour wise, not bad. i suspect they added alot of msg as i felt very thirsty after eating the Lor Mee. Fried fish was crispy even though i believed it have there on the shelf for quite sometime.

Overall, can eat. I noticed their prawn noodle is also very popular. Based on my observation, many people were having that.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
