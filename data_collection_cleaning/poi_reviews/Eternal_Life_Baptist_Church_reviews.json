      "text": "I attended the 3rd July English Service (2016). I was greeted by their pleasant young people serving as ushers. They started the service punctually.\n\nMusicians were mainly young people - 4 piece band consisting of keyboardist, guitarist, bassist and drummer. Good music. The selection of songs seems intentional - about Surrendering Our Life to God.\n\nThe speaker was a guest speaker - Dr Desmond Soh. Enjoyed the sermon about Responding to the Master's Call (Luke 5:1-11) with a bit of the cultural and contextual background of the text. Good humor with \"Singlish\" thrown in and connected with the congregation.\n\nAfter service, I was ushered into a small room for refreshment and met a few more friendly members of the congregation.\n\nOverall a very pleasant and inspiring experience.\n\nShalom.",
