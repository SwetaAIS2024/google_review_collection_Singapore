Jee Nee Lim,5,"Bedok Cooked Food is back after a 3-year hiatus! Best char siew, roast pork and best roast duck ever! I only eat duck from this stall - no other can match it. The quality and tasting their food has not changed at all. If anything, the char siew has improved in flavour. I hope all their old customers will return to support them.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101109994280504072291/reviews
