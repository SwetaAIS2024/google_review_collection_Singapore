      "text": "Ample parking. Good food & service. Food came out fast too. All the dishes were commendable. Perhaps the trio egg spinach soup could have more soup/liquid. Good Portion sizes. We ordered 2 soups. 6 dishes were more than sufficient to feed 8 pax. $18/pax is a good feed. Wasabi prawn could have used better quality wasabi paste/sauce. Did not give the kick. But the prawns were fresh and big. Overall good clean ambience with fans for a cooler experience.",

However, the quality and quantity of the fish was rather disappointing. The honeydew wasabi prawns and caipo tofu were OK. Will be back to try the other dishes.",
