      "text": "Sharing my first best experience with Spajelita_sg, the only Arabian Spa in Singapore. On 5th Aug,  I had my Jelita Soul Ginger Experience. My masseuse, Rosa was very polite and patient in explaining to me what she was doing, and constantly checked up on me to see if the massage was okay or too hard on me. Met Hannah after session and she showed me around and also explaining on spa packages they offer. Overall experience, was amazing! Would definitely recommend my non/muslim ladies to have their ‚Äúmetime‚Äù over here! I would definitely return! Thank you for having me over. ü§©",

      "text": "I only went twice or thrice despite having alot of balances left in my package that i bought during their promotion. Everything was fine, greeted well, massage was good until when you want to leave they will hard sell you with packages. I had enough and tired of pushing them. Every session i came just to finish up my package yet they are there to sell you more. Some of my balances still not used up but they eagerly pushing for sales. It traumatised me to go there and book appointment each time. I went there with my friend and she said overall the experience was just so-so and she agreed that the seller was hardselling and when we try to push away, we can sense the unhappy vibe. If you want to keep your customers coming back, don't keep asking them every session. Wait until the last session at least. I felt cheated because my money left in the package is still alot more but i don't wish to come back because of the hardselling and it makes me so traumatising. I apologise for my words.",

I thoroughly enjoyed my spa session here with my sister. My only feedback is the massage therapist can be more gentle. I reminded her 3 times to reduce pressure but she kept increasing the pressure after a few minutes.",
