AA,5,"We highly recommend Gladys Care to anyone seeking nanny services. Gladys was very responsive, accommodating to our bespoke requests and patient with questions. She assigned us Nanny Lily as our live-out night nanny for 3 months, which included post-natal massage for a week. We found Nanny Lily to be warm, trustworthy and experienced with infant care. She offered helpful suggestions while always respecting our childcare preferences. Our baby loved her and we miss her very much! We are grateful to Gladys for finding us such good care and will definitely use her agency again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115401133365724364809/reviews

Lee Ruijian,5,"We are very fortunate to have a great 28 days of confinement with Nanny Julie, as well as the brilliant massages performed by Ms Gladys.

My wife and I enjoyed the process, the food and of course the human touch factor.

Tagging on their vast knowledge, we matured along our parenting journey. Not an easy journey but these angels decided to give us a good start on this journey.

Great thanks to Gladys and her team.
We really appreciate your presence.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116233952163112761675/reviews
Harsh Raghuvir,5,"We had the pleasure of hiring Gladys Care’s confinement nanny service in Singapore, and we were incredibly fortunate to have Tammy as our nanny for our newborn twins.

Tammy provided exceptional round-the-clock support to my wife, ensuring she had everything she needed during this crucial postpartum period. Tammy’s expertise and dedication were evident in how she seamlessly bridged cultural and language divides, fostering a warm and supportive environment in our home. She was highly attentive to the needs of our twins and also respected our parenting preferences, making sure to communicate openly with us every step of the way. Her ability to balance care for both babies with our family’s unique needs made this experience so much smoother. We are deeply grateful for her professional yet caring approach and highly recommend Gladys Care for anyone seeking top-tier confinement care.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107920450514543163542/reviews
Han Nguyen,5,I had twins at 37 weeks and could not latch them immediately as they were too small. My supply went down from 40ml to as low as 10ml per pump as I started spending my days feeding the babies formula. Gladys came to our rescue a week after the delivery with her TCM breast massages. We had 4 sessions together and she gave me tons of advice on my diet and lifestyle to holistically help with the supply. I have definitely seen a steady increase now pumping 70-90ml at a time and Gladys thinks it’ll go up more if I keep pumping regularly! I am so happy and excited to be able to finally feed my babies the good stuff. Thank you Gladys!,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113093380960818911062/reviews
