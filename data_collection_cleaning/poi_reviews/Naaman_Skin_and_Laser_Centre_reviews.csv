JAY CHUA (蔡戔倡),5,"Good Part:
The place had lovely views from the windows and was clean and pleasant inside. It's a nice place with good doctors who provide clear instructions and can speak both Chinese and English. The staff at the front desk were also great, they even gave us bottled mineral water to drink because we had to wait for a while.

Hope to Improve: (Problem Solved)
But, there was a small issue that needs attention. It seemed like one of the nurses wasn't very experienced, as she had trouble drawing blood during injections for my family member's arm. My family member's arm became bruised due to the blood draw. She had to ask a more experienced colleague for help to draw blood again, totaling two attempts on different arms, and this made our waiting time longer, from 3:45 pm to 5:30 pm. I'd be happy to give a 5-star rating if they can improve this in the future. (Problem Solved)

⭐️ Problem solved:
I upgraded my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars. The service is truly good. The medical team saw my Google review, contacted us, and reimbursed the cost of the injections. We are truly thankful to them. You can see how well the service works.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103744688691222903141/reviews

Chengcheng Liu,2,"The doctor is very good and patient. However, the registration staff in the clinic are not good At every visit, they ask you to provide the insurance card screenshot with the latest date. If it’s just 2 weeks later for a follow up visit, they still keep asking you to provide. This is very annoying. If they can’t believe the insurance status, they can verify with the insurance company because the screenshot can be photoshopped with the latest date. The registration experience sucks and it’s so rigid and the staff are not polite.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112045270860023760966/reviews
Nooy,5,"I recently visited the clinic and was thoroughly impressed! Dr Khoo  was incredibly knowledgeable and meticulous, guiding me through my treatment options with care.

Ronnie Goh,5,"I’ve been seeing Dr Khoo for my eczema since 2019. I relied on medications and creams for years, adjusting the dosage as needed, until one day, Dr Khoo suggested that I try carnivore diet. It actually took me awhile to be willing to start on this diet because it is a lot of perseverance to commit. But I tried anyway.

After 3 months on this diet, I noticed the itching reduced, my skin started to heal, I was able to cut down on the medication without the eczema flaring up, and the best part I even lost 13 kg, dropping from 82 kg to 69 kg. I am back to my healthy weight. How crazy was that!

I am back for my review yesterday and Dr. Khoo change my appointments to open date because I no longer need medication.

Thank you Dr Khoo!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108533463984806543473/reviews
