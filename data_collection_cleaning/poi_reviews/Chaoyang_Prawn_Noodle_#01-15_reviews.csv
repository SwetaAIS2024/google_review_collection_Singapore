A T,5,"Update- no joints painâ€¦.

Super tasty thick broth which reminds me of my Okinawa Ramen!  But of course this is prawn noodles with added braised pork and pork lard is crispy.  Braised pork is abit salty very å…¥å‘³ for me but letâ€™s see later if my joints will get pain or not ðŸ˜….  But this can be forgiven coz so yummy!ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ oh but lack of green veg - Kang Kong, but there were some bean sproutâ€¦ but still can forgive lah!  My Laogong already said so may â€˜Wowsâ€™ as he as gulping down the soup! And as I finished posting, we decided to order 1 more bowl while still waiting for Satay.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110290698573319690288/reviews

Marcus Nah,3,"Purposely make a trip to have a try on some of the hawker food here..  Trying out the saved list in my Google map.

I order a normal prawn noodle soup.. After trying not fantastic just I would said another regular normal prawn noodle stall..

I don't know about other days.. but I find it quite bland as I was having it.. subject to individual preferences of course. Some may find it nice maybe.. no comment just my preference.

But the service from the stall owner still quite good so far for now..",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108851483842225070997/reviews
Ed Is Here,3,"Heard good things about the prawn noodle so proceed to have a try. Was told that the usual uncle cooking is overseas.
Overall, an above average prawn noodle. The black sauce goes well with noodle. Prawn is small size sliced into half. The soup is a little disappointing as it is a little too salty and there is not much prawn flavour in the soup. The photo as shown is a big bowl of noodle at 6 dollars.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116458940252063311103/reviews
huang mark,5,One of the best dried prawn mee I've tried. The broth is not too heavy on the pork rib taste and is thick in prawn taste. Sweetness is not obvious. Worth a try. Did not try the soup version however the broth that come with it is very peppery. Probably the soup version would taste similar.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115214546008342128775/reviews
