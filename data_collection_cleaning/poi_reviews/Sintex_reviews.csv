Christina Ng,5,"Sintex is an established bedlinen brand in Singapore.  It is one of the few brands which carries a wide variety of high quality, contemporary cotton bed sheets that won't break the bank. The combed cotton sheets are lightweight, airy and smooth, making it suitable for hot and humid climate in Singapore. Their bedlinen is made to last and feel better with every subsequent wash. My mom is a huge fan of Sintex since 1980s. Some of our bedlinen last us for years without pilling or discolouring. That truly speaks volume of its quality.

The queen sized bedsheet set comes with 1 fitted sheet, 2 bolster case and 2 pillow case which makes it exceptional value for money.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111522949476385686936/reviews
