      "text": "Finally got to try their hotpot. Just walk-in, luckily got a table for me. As this eatery, tot has 2 levels for dine-in, only less than 5 tables. The staff service was nice & friendly, & knowing how to engage & interact with their customer.\n\nOrdered their pumpkin soup broth, abit plain taste for me. The sauce was made by myself, not much taste either. Luckily, add-on the fried garlic & shallots to make the pumpkin soup more flavourful to cook for the instant noodles. Indeed the instant noodles was nice & chewy, like to cook till soft as beforehand, the staff did inform me to cook it longer. However, in the midst of hotpot boiling, there were afew times soup got spilled, got scared out ðŸ˜‹",

      "text": "Been here twice within a month as well because we crave for the pepper pork soup, hands down one of the best hotpot broth we have tried, compare to the big names out there.\n\nWhat I especially like is the family run concept, no frills, just good old hotpot. The people that run the place are so kind and attentive, it feels like you are dining at someoneâ€™s home versus a restaurant.\n\nThis place has 2 levels which can accommodate 7-8 tables and the play some old school Chinese music which bring back lots of memories!\n\nTheir condiments station is limited however on the contrary, because you have less sauce to play with, you get to taste the food better.\n\nWe have tried tomato and also mala but our conclusion is that we will take one broth the next time as the pepper pork soup is their signature, order the noodles and slurp every bit of its goodness. We also tried to be creative and ordered some you tiao to replicate a bit of bak kut teh feel, sooooo good.\n\nI love this Taiwanese style stewed pork rice, generous portions and the stewed pickle veges really taste like homemade I had back home.\n\nThe only thing I wish they could add to their menu is dumplings because it will go so well with the broth and if their condiments section has spring onions or coriander, you might find me hanging out this place more often than you thought :)\n\nHavenâ€™t try their ice cream, they have many options available, may be next time!",
