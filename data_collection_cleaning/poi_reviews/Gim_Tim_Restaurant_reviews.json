      "text": "We ordered the Crispy prawn roll,  Yam ring, Salted Chicken,  Spinach With Trio egg, wasabi prawns. Must say the service is good with free flow of chrysanthemum teas. Servings were generous for 4 pax. The yam ring is a bit dry but had lots of scallops. I didn't like the salted chicken as it was too salty. Would order the crispy prawn roll again as it was delicious. Parking was easy. Those who like traditional restaurants and food can give it a try.",

The food is excellent, and the prices are reasonable. I particularly enjoyed the Yam Ring, which comes with a generous portion of scallops for just $30. The Yee Foo Mee in medium size, priced at $16, is also a favorite of mine. Surprisingly the Pao Fan prawn is so big and juicy. I will definitely be back again.",

Outstanding dishes: Hei Zhou (not typical and surprising), pumpkin prawn, and the bun that came with the pork belly-  soft and fluffy. Coffee pork ribs otherwise just ok.",

Their staff apologized and compensated with cold dessert only. Last but not least, the female toilet was very dirty. The flush system was very weak so you can imagine what was the end result.\n\nSo I hope the management can take my feedback seriously and review their hygiene in food and restaurant.",
