This mall is very popular and crowded so it makes walking very very difficult when it rains when stall holders display well beyond it allowable boundaries marked by \"yellow brackets\". Long time store owners even defy the our useless town council members and even our MP is useless in enforcing the HDB rules.",

There is a few minimarts, hairdressers, hardware shops and fruits shops within the vicinity. There is also a Singapore Pools outlet facing Yishun Ring road. Residents living along Yishun ave 11, ave 6 will have their day to day needs very well served. Negative is that the sheltered walkways can be pretty cram during crowded hours as it is narrow.",
