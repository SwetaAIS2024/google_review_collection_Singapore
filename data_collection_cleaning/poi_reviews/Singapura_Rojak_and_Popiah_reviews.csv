Cheng,4,"This stall is a hidden gem within Joo Seng Food Place.  I ordered the rojak and popiah.  it turned out that both are surprisingly good!

The ingredients of the rojak are well prepared.  The tau-pok and you-tiao are toasted to the right crispy state, there are mango and jambu which are not found in most rojak! The prawn paste dressing is not too sweet which is to my liking.

The popiah is also better than most stalls. Not to be missed as well!

Do note that there is no prominent sign displayed so you have to know the place and look out for it.  The stall is closed on Saturday and Sunday, so it's not for weekend food hunters!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112994654283661324793/reviews
