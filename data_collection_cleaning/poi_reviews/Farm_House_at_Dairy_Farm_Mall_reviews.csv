Mantou,5,"Would usually come here for the Japanese food. First time try the Chinese stall. Nice, the 辣子鸡 Chongqing chicken is even better than most restaurant.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118213126945726447138/reviews
Jacob TAN,5,"Quite a good mix of stalls over here. Had the Japanese food. The salmon and ikura Don was fresh and the rice was good. The keisen chirashi Don was also very fresh. The presentation of the Wasabi was beautiful.
The coffee shop had very good coffee and tea. The people preparing the drinks were very professional at performing their task.
The only complaint here is that service was quite slow and internet connection was not good.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews

Ming Hui,5,Not too bad a place for afternoon lunch. Quiet area at dairy farm cuz this mall is new. But nice place to hang out after a walk at the hill next door. This place is rather small with 7 outlets only. But I like the Japanese stall with nice chirashi bowl. I also love the kopifella stall. They sell the best tea and coffee to me. Love it.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108198322351045531056/reviews
