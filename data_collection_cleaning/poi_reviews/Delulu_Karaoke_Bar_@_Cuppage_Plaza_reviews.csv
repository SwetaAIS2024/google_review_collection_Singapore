Tony Aw,5,"Went there to support my little sister. The place turns out to be quite chilled,with great karaoke and sound systems, spacious and friendly crew/staff. No photos to submit sadly but if I go again I'll remember to update my review. There's also a darts machine there. With roughly around 9 tables in the middle with alot more on the sides.
