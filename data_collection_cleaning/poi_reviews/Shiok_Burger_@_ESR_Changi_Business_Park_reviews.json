Tried the beef cheese fries as well popcorn chicken, tastes wise, they are really yummy. Reason why 3 stars is given, this is ordered via delivery but 1 set of the orders did not come with fries and drinks. I was not refunded too despite numerous times of follow ups. It was not a good experience at all!",
