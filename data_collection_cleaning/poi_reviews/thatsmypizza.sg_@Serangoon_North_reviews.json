The pizza has a delightful, stove-baked flavor with a slight charring on the edges, which adds to its deliciousness. Additionally, the ingredients used are fresh and flavorful. Overal is good. I love their Hand-stretched Applewood Bacon Bufala Pizza, kids love the hand-stretched Grandma's Curry Chicken.",

The pizza is chewy yet tasty, we tried the Kurobuta pork- super yummy, kid’s’ favorite! And also classic Hawaiian- cant go wrong.\nThank you for bringing this delish pizza to our area!!",
