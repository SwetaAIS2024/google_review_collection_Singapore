Nice surroundings and the beach just a short walking distance away. Overall, good food. There is also prayer room for customers. Recommended!",

Excellent menu, highly recommend the mutton ribs and briyani rice.\nWe had a small birthday celebration with 25 friends and family members. We booked two long tables and pre ordered the food from the menu the previous day. When our guests arrived the food was served with out delay and we just ordered drinks. The service was smooth, food was fresh and all of it gave a wholesome experience. Highly recommend the restaurant.",

They accommodated to outdoor dining, which was initially set to indoor to give us more comfort.\nWith kids , itâ€™s better to have it outdoors - for easy access to the outdoor ECP playground.\nThe mini library was great as well, kids enjoyed a breather from outdoor play here! Do take note, it converts to prayer place during prayer times.\n\nThe free icecream for every customer is a nice tough, the cookies and cream is sedap!\n\nClean toilets (albeit a bit dark).\n\nThe food is to the point, pizza was also good!",

      "text": "Located in the busy Marine Cove, this outlet has always done well in terms of customer traffic. I found the food to be decently yummy although every single dish was too salty. The stand out dish was the mini tulang. Service was poor. While I understand this is not a five star hotel, the staff AND management shd understand that with tulang there will be a need for additional serviettes or replacement of serving plates. The cashier at the counter informed me yes I could pay with Grab. But after I reloaded my Grab wallet with a couple of hundred to pay the bill it turned out Grab could not be used. NOT a major complaint but it shows the staff are not well trained. The  decor is also quite horrid with the terrible things hanging down from the ceiling making the place look dark and cramped. This adding to the musky air permeating the whole place makes for a very dingy atmosphere. I recommend dabao instead of eating in - your dining experience will be far superior at home.",

Please help ur staff.\nDont burden them with a crazy big menu.\nIf gordon ramsay was here, he wld shut down operations for that service\n\nI understand operating an FnB operation in any country is not easy especially here in singapore.\n\nYour challenge is to formulate solutions to maximise efficiency and smooth running of operations.",
