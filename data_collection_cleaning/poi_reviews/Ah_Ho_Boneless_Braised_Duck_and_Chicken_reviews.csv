Szarina Ko,5,"A FAVE. Lost count of how many times I've come here to have lunch. Their duck noodles are amazing, and Uncle is really generous with the portions. The chili is flavorful and I love the herbal taste of the soup. Uncle is also very friendly and kind!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108788545406059498216/reviews
JC C,5,Uncle sells very delicious traditional teochew duck! The taste reminded me of my grandmother's braised teochew duck! A real hidden gem ðŸ’Ž,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113718753133606547030/reviews
CK C,2,"Very affordable kway chap. Uncle was very friendly too. E-payment and CDC vouchers accepted.

Unfortunately, everything was tasteless and hard. The pork belly, intestine, gizzard and egg tasted like they were simply blanched with plain water.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
MNG,3,"The kway had a clean soup base, not herbal.
The duck was lean and $5 portion came with some dried bean puff, pork belly, intestine and an egg. Taste wise, it was plain flavored and tad salty.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
Kevin Lee,2,"Kway Chap was ok, but didn't get any intestines? Instead was given duck meat. Not sure if uncle just forgot, he is quite old.

Was dabao and didn't catch until reached home, make sure to check.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110248726515629912431/reviews
