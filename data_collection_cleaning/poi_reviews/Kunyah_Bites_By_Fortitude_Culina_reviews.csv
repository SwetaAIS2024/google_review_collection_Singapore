Britney K,5,"I absolutely love the food here! Tried the grilled rendang rice bowl and enjoyed the fragrance, taste, and generous portion! The vegetables and egg were very delicious, complementing the meal.

I bought the Japanese curry chicken and the five spices chicken after class, and again, they were incredibly delectable. My favourite has to be the grilled rendang!

As they are moving soon, I hope that the new location will love and support the wonderful staff and food too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102375260762123876759/reviews
amelia,5,"ordered the crispy chicken rendang and chicken katsu sando sandwiches - both were very delicious and extremely affordable! the meat was very juicy and skin was crispy. the egg was well-seasoned and the bread was perfectly toasted.

overall, would highly recommend this to everyone! just note that it's a pretty big sandwich so if you're looking for a quick bite, this may not be the best. but otherwise, highly recommended :-)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102231300111161299969/reviews
Bryan Tan,4,"I love Kunyah. Their highlight is definitely their rendang dishes.

The vegetables used to be sweet, crunchy and moist. Really good combination. However, the vegetables are a little less flavourful now.

The grilled chicken could be grilled to a higher level of crispness but it’s standard has mostly kept up. Definitely a highlight and must try.

The rice is also decent. I can somewhat taste the coconut in it. However it also used to be stronger in flavour. Perhaps less rice and more flavour would go a long way.

The egg is alright but I feel that focus should be on the chicken and veg which are the best part of this set.

At $6.80 it’s a value for money set. If the quality control is better it would be perfect!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100172346597544084544/reviews
Angie,5,"Second time back and I ordered the “meatless” (tempeh) scallion noodles with latte macchiato.

Very good value with generous portion of tempeh! Rendang sauce is flavorful and tempeh was hot and crispy. Noodles were of the right consistency.

Service staff are all very friendly!

Come and support our differently-abled chefs - enjoy the food and support the team at the same time!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113524895917375971246/reviews
Ming,4,"Had the grilled chicken rendang. Chicken rendang was nicely cooked, tender and slightly charred on the edge of the meat. Rendang was fragrant, mildly spicy. Fried egg could be better. Side vege was okay, slightly overcooked. Portion was good and reasonably priced. All for the good cause. Will be back to try the sandwich.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109226628464118431877/reviews
