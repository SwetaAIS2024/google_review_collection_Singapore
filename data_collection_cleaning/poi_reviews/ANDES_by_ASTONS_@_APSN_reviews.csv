nicole lai,5,"I chanced upon this cafe on google whilst looking for a lunch place. If you‚Äôre not in a hurry for time, I really recommend visiting this cafe! The staff here have special needs and are extremely hardworking and earnest in their service! Compared to other outlets, the veggies are boiled/steamed and do not have the microwave taste (a personal peeve of mine), and the chicken is throughly cooked and freshly grilled.

I really recommend reading into all the initiatives and vocational pathways you‚Äôre contributing to the staff here when patronising their business. They‚Äôve got some cakes and drinks too if you‚Äôre looking for a lighter mealü•∞ Do note the opening hours as well as they‚Äôre not open for dinner!

There are even private rooms you can reserve for larger groups!

Will be back again for sure!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104880583932729054273/reviews
