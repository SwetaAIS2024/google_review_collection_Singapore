Zhou Xinchen (Epps),5,"BEST.SCHOOL.EVER. Queues are long but worth waiting. Except that recess is only 30 minutes…. Teachers are approachable and friendly. Also, lots of people tagging and running around the canteen…im one of them……",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115374374628684874597/reviews
Tham Ryden (Dunmanss),1,"im back again i give new review ok i too lenient last time. pri 1 to pri 4 ok BUT there is one particular teacher. Mr Yusman, dont be biased to the girls ok u old man and “assumption” method in math is real we dont care about “supposition” and when i picked up my pencil u asked me to write reflection because i was talking. Understandable, i do love talking to my pencil. Hope u enjoyed that reflection i wrote of u :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117984166341201734928/reviews
lightbrush kiss,3,"i mean its ok lah.
sum teachers there are sort of ‘unreasonable’ but most of them r ok. yall newbies must behave or the teachers will lose it and start yelling and punish the while class
and like what my fren said below, mrs tham is best teacher teehee
the school toilets sumtimes, dirty sumtimes clean. theres a bidet sooo yayyy!!!!
the food is ok but theres only 3 halal stores, the lines r long sumtimes.
for any of yall going there, i wish u the best in this school! (ITS NOT BAD OR ANYTHING JS DONT MISBEHAVE)

Biggest SimpOutThere,4,"Ex student here. I'll say the environment is ok lah, but they might want to fix the level one toilet stench. Most of the school staff are kind and understanding(except for SOME TEACHERS, but unless ur super unlucky u will meet the good teachers) and the canteen food is pretty good. Overall I will recommend this school is pretty good. Just be warned that the kids are a bit overcompetitive but other than that, I'd recommend this school!
