      "text": "Schoolâ€™s discipline gotten worse after most of the good teachers left. 2024 P6 sports carnival was terrible. The person who organised the sports carnival gave all the teachers in charge refreshing drinks while we boys get nothing but water despite our effort in the sports carnival. This school is so damn terrible as there are tons of bullying cases about boys pushing each other into the pond (they added barriers but there is still a little gap at the pond area, which boys might be pushed or shoved in there.) There are also no toilet paper in the toilets unlike St Patrickâ€™s School. Some of the teachers care about the discipline drop ðŸ“‰, but the other teachers do not and be lazy. My Primary 4 Science teacher, Mrs Tan Lee Huang, was caught slacking on her job and got fired but rehired by the school. How is the school going to trust her? I also suffered for 2-3 years in this school through bullying.",

Really like how the school places a strong emphasis on the Catholic faith and values for the boys to serve. The weekly online Rosary session is great for boys to learn how to pray. Kudos to the school.",
