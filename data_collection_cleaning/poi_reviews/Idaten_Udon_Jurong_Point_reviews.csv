Flying Molen,4,"If you want to get a quick and simple Japanese food, I would recommend this chain restaurant. The quality of the udon that you can get and the price you pay is very reasonable. We went to the Jurong Point branch today and the place was not crowded. While I didn‚Äôt expect a Japanese quality of service, I still believed that the tone of the staff could be a bit friendlier. A good spirit of hospitality and gratitude should not be dependent on the price of the food ü•∞",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113209867782143825808/reviews
Ken Tan,4,Self service ordering and free seating area shared with wadori at Jurong point basement Japanese food street.  The signature Niku Udon was chewy and good with light soup.  Also tried the Nikku curry udon with fried beef patty which is also delicious.  They also have a section of tempura items where you can choose from.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100121205735734303463/reviews
