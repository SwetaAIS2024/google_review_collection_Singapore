Natalya Sobolevskaya,5,I love the elegant design of Miku shoes and lovely colours. The extra width at the front makes them really comfortable and the covered heel gives extra support. I can easily match these shoes with different outfits and wear them for a long time throughout the day.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103141291198058536118/reviews

Faen Fadzil,5,Walking made easy with these great shoes. I personally tried shiori & Miku and loved it. Shiori is easy to pair with when you are wearing formal wear. The leather finishing is smooth which makes it suitable for formal events. The rubber soles also provides excellent grip when walking on smooth surfaces. I personally have bunion and the toe box fits nicely to accommodate my bunions too. Miku on the other hand is most comfortable for casual outings. It is fashionable with firm heel cup which is rare to find elsewhere.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111859618141521380190/reviews
