Yes I'm closing my UOB account.",

She greeted each one of us with a bright smile and informed us of our waiting time. All the counters were opened and I was attended to swiftly. I am pleased with the service provided. There was a separate queue for the exchange of new money for lunar new year and it did not interfere with those queuing to do other banking matters. Well done!",

Tell me why do we still need to wait at least an hour to be served? Ridiculous! The RMs are even walking around chit chatting to each other, what’s the purpose of their existence?",

I hope in future the uob reception would ask clients if they have brought their physical ic before giving a queue number. And the reception must not tell clients that the wait is 10 to 15 minutes when the counters are not able to fulfill the stated wait time.\nNow I have to re-queue all over again at another branch as the novena branch closes at 12.30pm on Saturdays.",
