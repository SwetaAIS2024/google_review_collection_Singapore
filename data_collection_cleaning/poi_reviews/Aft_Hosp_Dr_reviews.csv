Ethan Ong Wee Tiong,1,"Feedback on the rude n totally unprofessional bus driver of bus 197.

Normally, I drive but today 2/5/25 Fri about 1.10pm, I decided to use public transport as it was a short journey.

When I boarded the bus 197 at Bukit Merah towards Chinatown, I greeted the bus driver (I always do so when boarding a bus) n tapped on the reader on the right hand side. No reader error.

When alighting at the bus stop after Hospital Drive (outside SGH) at about 1.30pm, there was card reader error so I approached him.

He asked me to tap my card again at the boarding card reader which then displayed a new journey again. I asked what would happen when I tap at the alighting reader again.

He was very impatient n brushed me off n just told me to go n tap. I asked him is it going to charge me at the wrongful full fare rate but he just brushed me off without giving a proper answer.

I told him that when I boarded the bus, I greeted him but he said he couldnâ€™t remember n said something like donâ€™t delay his driving.

So I tapped at the alighting reader again but it still showed error n i told him again. This time, he even challenged me if I wanted to block his driving journey.

His behavior was totally unacceptable, uncalled for & unprofessional.

And I was being wrongfully charged the maximum full fare rate of $2.10 (refer to photo).",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112485984526390357369/reviews
GoAheadGroupFan,5,"The bus stop where I took service 2, 120, 121, 122, 174 and 174e was Eu Tong Sen Street (10017 - After Hospital Drive) as there was no boarding at this terminal. The terminal was relocated to Kampong Bahru Bus Terminal on Saturday 10th March 2018 as the last day of operations was on Friday 9th March 2018. It is now permanently closed to make way for the Elective Care Centre which is a new wing of the Singapore General Hospital. It had been in operation from Saturday 6th June 1987 to Friday 9th March 2018. The three Chinatown Direct services introduced on Friday 21st January 2005 had been operated from this terminal to Ang Mo Kio (CT8), Bedok (CT18) and Clementi (CT28). However, the last day of operations for Chinatown Direct CT28 was on Sunday 7th February 2016 due to the Bus Contracting Model that does not include the service in any bus package. The bus services that used to serve the terminal were bus services 2, 12, Express 12e, 54, 120, 121, 122, 174, Fast Forward 174e, 190, Chinatown Directs CT8 and CT18. The nearest MRT station was Outram Park MRT Station.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105877449322822053371/reviews
