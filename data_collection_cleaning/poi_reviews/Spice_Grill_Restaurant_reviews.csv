Sarbjeet Singh,5,"A Flavorful Journey at Spice Grill
Spice Grill in Singapore is a culinary gem that has captured my taste buds and left me craving more. From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere that perfectly complemented the delicious aromas wafting from the kitchen.
The menu is a delightful exploration of authentic Indian cuisine, offering a wide range of dishes to suit every palate. I opted for the butter chicken and naan, and I was not disappointed. The butter chicken was rich, creamy, and bursting with flavor, while the naan was soft, fluffy, and perfectly cooked. The combination was simply divine.
The service was impeccable. The staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu, making my dining experience even more enjoyable. The ambiance was also perfect, with soft lighting and soothing music creating a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere.
If you're looking for a truly authentic Indian dining experience in Singapore, I highly recommend Spice Grill. It's a must-visit for any food lover!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100950335512716867268/reviews
A K,1,"I recently visited the Spice Grill restaurant, but unfortunately, it seems they're catering more to tourists than locals. The prices have skyrocketed, making it unaffordable for regular customers. It's a shame, as the food might be good, but the target audience seems to be visitors willing to pay a premium, rather than loyal locals.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112436267065863657518/reviews
Balamurugan M,5,"The restaurant located closed to Tanjong Pagar MRT at Icon Village. We ordered with Starters like Samosa, Samosa chaat, Papadi Chaat, Veg Pakora, Full Tandoori Chicken and main course was aloo paratha, kadai Paneer with Tandoor Roti and Garlic butter Naan. Everything was Yummy and Tasty. Even Kids like the Samosa which was apt for them. Should try this restaurant for North Indian Food.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115380808133947211669/reviews
