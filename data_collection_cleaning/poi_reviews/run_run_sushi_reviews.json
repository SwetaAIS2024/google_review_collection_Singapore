Plus the sauce was a waste, didn't even used half a bowl of sauce to finish the noodles. Not a huge fan of sauce as it was too sour to go with the noodles.",

Wish they had more options for the base besides white rice though.\n\nIngredients are fresh, though taste-wise nothing too different from what you'd get at other sushi/salad bars. Still, glad to have a healthy option at Ion basement.",

It wasn't worth $56 for the amount of sashimi. The salmon is not as thick as I thought it would be. Dipping sauce is too much and taste normal too. Can easily get the same quality of salmon with bigger portion at other place at a cheaper rate.",
