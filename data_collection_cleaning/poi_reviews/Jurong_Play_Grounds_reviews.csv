Michael Sky Lin,4,"a place where u can bring your pets for a staycation or a swim workout, bring your kids for swimming lesson, play some tennis or do some gardening shopping. Situated just opposite IMM building & near Ng Teng Fong Hospital. it is very convenient to take public transport. If driving, the carpark is quite small but can always park at IMM when full.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107384822385284623867/reviews

Desiree L,5,"Have lived in Toh Guan for around 10 years...Good to see this area becoming more lively...much better than last time when it was call Spark... use to have people coming in to the car park to play music, drink beer and smoke, but now got a lot of activities around...and no more people smoking and drinking in the car park until late... My children like to go and see when they have markets but dunno why these few months don't have..  Good to see more families and children around.. also brighter at night, feel safer when walking home from IMM",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114018636895003605522/reviews
