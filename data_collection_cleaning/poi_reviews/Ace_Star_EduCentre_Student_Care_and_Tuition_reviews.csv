Fiona Tan,1,"1) No CCTV recording to clarify on conflicts and scuffles

2) Scuffles are not resolved and looked into for the truth but counted as an offense regardless. Upon 3 offences regardless of child did it as an act of defence, child is asked to go. However this was not relayed to parent prior to registration especially when parent had concerns of child's restlessness after school during trial.

3) Principal mention that they don't do physical punishments. However when teacher is questioned, teacher deflects, denies and says, ""even if it happens, there's nothing wrong to it. That  parent should trust the teacher instead of said child, even when child was consistent in replies.""

4) Shows no care nor effort to understand and build child, not work with parents. It is run like a mercenary business not a student care that actually cares.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116431681729816547555/reviews
Lyna J.,5,"Our child was in Ace Star from 2022-2023. It was indeed a good student centre. We were able to notice how our child progressively excel in his school work etc. During term break, the centre also had activities that were curated suited for all levels. Our child loved it a lot!

Nevertheless, all I can say that it was a very pleasant experience having our child in a good centre like Ace Star.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107924176546984703062/reviews
Jocelyn Ong,5,"My son (P1) joined Acer Star Student Care for only 2 months but I see progressively improvement on him. His homework all completed at Ace Star Student Care and I do not have to worry for him for weekly English & Chinese spelling and all has been take care by Student Care.What impresses me most is that the teachers know him very well, and the kitchen auntie also specially takes care of his meals as she know he is a picky boy.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110001863428112861396/reviews
Doris Cheong,5,"My girl had been with Ace Star since primary 1. In the 2 years that she had been there, I am glad that her homework was always done and checked everyday.
As a working mother, I prefer this over school based student care and I can spend quality time with my child after my work.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100399903543958010287/reviews
Li Qiaoyuan,5,"Reynee has been with the student care since pri 2 august, till now pri 3 last term. I’m very thankful to Ace Star. They consistently go through the English and Chinese spelling as well as making sure she did her homework, thus I don’t need to have much worry on her, esp after a tiring working day. Aside, pri 3 onwards, my daughter is having CcA and extra lessons. Ace star helps in all ways, such as to fetch her after the extra lessons or to send her back for CCA after lunch in the centre. Other than that, during the school holidays, there are fun classes like roller skating, robotics, etc for the students and also the upcoming holidays, there are excursion to snow city and jewel.. it brings much enjoyment and fun for the kids.. and Reynee is really looking forward to it. I am very appreciated for their hard work and efforts. They definitely deserve the five stars I’m rating for them! I strongly recommend them to all parents.. Keep it up!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112391651996032855980/reviews
