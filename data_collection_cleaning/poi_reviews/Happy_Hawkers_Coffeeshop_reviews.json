Rice which I paid for- not included was all lumpy and distasteful and this really ruined the entire experience.\nThe toufu noodle slices were literally dumped into the container and left there. They din even bother to stir it.\nDefinitely won't visit again.\nWasted $10 on this store.\nThe container for the soup I would rate that 5/5. Managed to have 0 spillage!",
