Spicy Gluten Dr.,5,"Perfect for afternoon tea, for all students, researchers, professors and staffs. Brilliant ideas and discussion are companyed with the tea and cakes.

ian tay rongde,4,"Their salmon mentaiko bowl was so good... But I don't think they serve it anymore. Their drinks are very sweet. I always ask for siew dai, though I once heard someone order ""extra sweet""... She's built different, I guess. They don't serve iced drinks during university vacation time.. they said they don't bring in ice during the school breaks.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117336937434831170483/reviews
Edwin S,5,"It is located within the Engineering campus, near to the Cheers self-service minimart.

The stall sells kopi, teh, milo, honey lemon, and some others. The kopi they serve is good.

For snacks, they have a wide variety. They have the buns (Bo Luo Bao, hot dog bun), sandwiches (egg mayo, ham), waffles, fried items (samosa, banana ball, vadai), cakes (sold by the slice), and many others. The snacks are generally quite good.

The queue may be quite busy after lunch time and or tea-break time, but the queues are generally moving quickly.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113192406653516830642/reviews

Tan X.W,1,"Usually, I do not give 1 star to shop but the staff was extremely rude and dishonest. The scrambled egg sandwich is priced at $1.20 on the price tag.
