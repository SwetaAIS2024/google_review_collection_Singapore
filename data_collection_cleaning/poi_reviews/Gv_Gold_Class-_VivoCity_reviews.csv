Larktiss,3,"While the fried rice with pork chop were underwhelming, the fresh salad, beautiful presentation, and exceptional TWG tea made the meal enjoyable.  If you’re a tea lover, this set is worth it for the Eternal Summer tea alone.  Just hope they tweak the fried rice and pork chop.

Unfortunately, it was on the wet side, lacking the fluffy, separated grains you’d expect from a good fried rice.  A bit disappointing.
The pork chop wasn’t particularly juicy or flavorful, but it was decent enough to fill the plate.

Saving Graces:
Fresh Vegetable Salad: Crisp, refreshing, and is the bright spot in the meal!

Presentation: Effort was clearly put into plating the food, making it visually appealing and adding a touch of elegance.

TWG Eternal Summer Tea: The star of the meal! This hot tea was aromatic, soothing, and absolutely delightful. It elevated the entire experience and left a lasting impression.

Shyoe Sim,4,"A 4.5 stars - If you're just gonna sit back and enjoy the movie! Great and relaxing experience with the reclining seats, blanket and the space. But it can get too comfy that you fall asleep in the mid of the movie.

However, if you're going to dine in the movie, I'll give a 2.5 to 3 stars. Cos it's gonna be a dine in the dark experience and all the utensils sounds will be all around you during the first 30mins of the movie. You will be served based on your check in at the counter, and they will ask you for the confirmation of your popcorn sweet or salted. They will serve your drinks and popcorn first and until the show starts, your meal will be served. This can be a bit difficult for some cos you can't focus on the movie or the meal, you know, just a lil busy here and there. Since it's dark, you can't really tell what you're having unless the screen is bright and it can get a bit messy. Also, you will need sit up and eat your meal from the lil space at the side. As some patron cannot see well, they will on their flash to see, which can be quite disruptive.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105718399694197115499/reviews
Tommy Ng,4,"Located within Vivocity, take the yellow circle line or purple line and alight at Harbourfront station. Walk into Vivocity and head up to level 2, look for Golden Village Cinema which is right beside Challenger. The entrance to the Gold Class cinema is beside the counter selling movie bites.

GV gold class used to be the better choice for premium movie experience and complementary snacks but I honestly feel their standards have dropped. All they offer now are measly cookies and a bottle of water while their in-cinema dining menu are very overpriced food and tastes underwhelming. Sofa seats are not as comfortable and thus the overall movie experience is unjustifiable with it's prices.

Personally I would choose the other Cinemas with Platinum Suites. Hope GV Gold Class will step up their game soon!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108333284987009118312/reviews
Di Qiang Yeow,1,"I visited Golden Village Gold Class at Vivocity at 12am, 10 Sep 2023. My friends and I booked seats D1 to D6 for “The Nun” in Theatre 2.

Before the show, I ordered a glass of red wine in the lounge at 11.46pm. The wine was served promptly within a few minutes and the service was good.

However, at 11.59pm, a plump male tried to clear my almost-full glass of wine without any prior warning. After further inquiring, he said that the wine must be finished within one minute by 12am. This is witnessed by all 4 persons at the table and can be reviewed from the CCTV footage.

This is an absolutely disappointing experience, especially when you expect better service standards in gold class.

Roy Z1,4,"GV vivocity Golden class has the biggest screen comparing to other branches. It's a joyful experience.

Note: Didn't ordered any service, thus no review on them.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113082306159350095228/reviews
