Madeline Tan,5,Great food and great service. The place is brightly lit and spacious. Convenient ordering from the self ordering kiosk. The cajun here is my favourite.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108436566127328014139/reviews
Another Big Bite,4,Really nice place to chill. The chicken sandwich was pretty tasty. Meat is tender & juicy to the bite. Slight salty for me.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100408883882614888601/reviews
Daniel,3,"After hearing all the rave reviews from the US, we were excited to try Popeyes Singapore â€“ and it delivered on some fronts. The chicken sandwiches were a real standout: tender, bursting with flavor, and served on fresh, soft buns. The chips were well-seasoned, though they came off a bit soggy and lukewarm, and the extra free sauces were a nice bonus. We also enjoyed the crispy biscuit with jam.

On the downside, the signature chicken piece was mostly dry, and the hazelnut chocolate soft serve lacked a genuine hazelnut flavor, coming across more like a standard chocolate soft serve. The nonya chicken didnâ€™t impress either, and while the nonya pineapple drink was refreshing, it needed a good stir since most of the syrup settled at the bottom.

Adding to the mixed experience, a looping soundtrack played continuously at each location, which was quite annoying.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113727969720183131794/reviews

Keith Lee,1,"I have been a chef for more than 10 years, can't I tell that this is raw meat? Even canâ€™t shred the raw chicken because the muscle fibers are still intact. The staff at the store was still quibbling that this was the color of spicy and asked me if I wanted to exchange it for the original if get the spicy still will facing same problem. I felt that the answer was too unprofessional and he was just trying to evade responsibility. In fact, he just needed to exchange it for me instead of shirking responsibility with an arrogant attitude. Really bad experience!!!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101703826717529677557/reviews
