Lishen Lai,1,"Took the monorail from Vivo into Sentosa ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a long time. The tourists are back, which is a good thing. The queue management is severely lacking though. Everyone is packing at the monorail doors and the attendants offer a simple ‚Äúplease queue up‚Äù when there are no queue poles at all.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100771497340917711739/reviews

Prasas Prasasvinitchai,4,"My wife decided to take the Boardwalk and enjoyed the view. It took about 10 minutes of slow walk to cross.
After our trip at the Maritime Experiential Museum and the S.E.A. Aquarium, we were exhausted and decided to take the Sentosa Express.
I was surprised to learn that we didn't have to pay anything to get out. One only pays to get it.
We enjoyed the free ride which was very clean and smooth riding.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106426498774106470258/reviews

Cybermon K S,5,This truly an amazing engineering. The way the train runs as we watch from inside looks very scary. In fact the train is running on a thin concrete line with its Wheels attached on the sides of the concrete Lane. We can know this only once we watch it from under the MRT Lane. It has Got very few stops but it gives The travelers a very good experience.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112782651778817457152/reviews
