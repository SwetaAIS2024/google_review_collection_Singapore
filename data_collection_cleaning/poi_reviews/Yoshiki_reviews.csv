キャサリン,4,Chanced upon this jap stall during breakfast. Ordered their mee Siam. Surprisingly good. Very old school feel. Nice balance of sourness. Only thing lacking was no lime and gravy wasn’t hot enough thou it was in the soup pot but still it was good.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106077855246839514729/reviews

FH,4,"Tried the yakitori don for $6. Chicken was really tender and flavour was on point.

Portion size is a little small for $6 . Maybe more value if it came with a small bowl of miso soup.

Will come back to try other dishes",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105984351456008071975/reviews
