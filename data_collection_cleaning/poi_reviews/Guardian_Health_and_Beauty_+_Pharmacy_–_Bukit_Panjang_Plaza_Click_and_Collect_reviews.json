A woman dress in a black blouse and black trousers claiming to be a guardian staff barged in front of me and rushed to the casher as the position opened up. Later I realised she was helping to pay for another lady in a mobility device. It would have been better if she had explained it or asked to go first because she was helping someone instead of shouting that she is a guardian staff and rushing to pay before I can react.\n\nBad experience, will not shop at guardian again. Will go shop at Unity or elsewhere instead.",
