Teas were superb, especially Velvet Brew which had notes of chocolate but wasn’t sweet and very well balanced.\nSavoury treats were good while sweet treats were a bit bland in taste. Nevertheless, they all looked good and service made up for it.",

Just look at the pics.. every piece was thoughtfully crafted with multiple layers of harmonious flavours and textures. Simply divine!\nTQ to Lorenz & Leo for the excellent service we received all afternoon - attentive, knowledgeable & yet non-intrusive.\nIn short, Gingerlily has certainly won over my heart❤️.....",

Savouries were very good; I wish they focused more on the savouries because I think they were better than the desserts. The pre-dessert poached pear dish was excellent though, as was the cocktail! Also my server Shirlina was lovely, even helped me take a photo :')",
