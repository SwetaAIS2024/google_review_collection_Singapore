Their attitude was completely unacceptable, and it made what should have been a simple shopping trip extremely unpleasant. Even though it's cheaper to purchase here than at stores outside, it's not worth the experience at all.\n\nI would NOT recommend this store to anyone. It's clear they don't value their customers or their business.",

They may not be qualified to do so.\n\nWhen brought upon our prescriptions to them, they instead tried recommending another medicine and remarked that the doctor may have written the prescription incorrectly. Luckily we instead headed towards a qualified pharmacist and they had promptly assisted us on dispensing the medicine and verified the prescription by the doctor professionally.\n\nI sincerely hope that if the staffs are not qualified to provide prescription medicine, just say so and not misled and try selling other products to your customers. On extreme cases, it could be life threatening!",
