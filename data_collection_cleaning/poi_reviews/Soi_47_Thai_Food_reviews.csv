Derrick Lin,4,"Super chill corner in Toa Payoh to enjoy Thai food. Ordered the vegetarian green curry and it was surprisingly good as I tried the chicken version and the chicken meat tasted “frozen”. The Tom yum seafood was okay but hot, a bit on the salty side. There’s a chill out corner at the side of the restaurant. Service was good and prompt.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105989843156970934066/reviews
CK Cheong,3,"A popular eatery among the locals, it was almost full house at dinner time on a Saturday. Ordered the tomyam gong, stuffed chicken wings, fried eggs and olive fried rice. The food was tasty but not exceptional. The portion for the fried eggs was large, good for 3-4pax. Fast service",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114524725497942089541/reviews
Veronica Pestana,3,"The food here seems to be not as good as before, the veggies were hard and the salad was rather salty.
Ordered the chicken basil with fried egg and a minced pork salad.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107681237278744268338/reviews
JJ Liv,3,"Food is thai homely, ordered the thai tomyum soup chicken, kailan, Moo Ping, prawn cakes and dessert have the Red Ruby.  My fav is the prawn cake as is served piping hot and juicy. My least is the moo ping as it’s fried instead of grill which makes it very dry and red ruby is not my type",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105490838154173729550/reviews
Chloe Lin,4,"Authentic Thai food. Tasty and value for money for portion given. Braised pork trotter is a little tough. Love the lime sauce squid - really appetising.

Service is a little lacking. They seem short handed and often got to chase after them for attention. During food ordering, staff seems a bit impatient.

Atmosphere is fine for me. Normal under the block cafe style. Nothing outstanding yet nothing outrageous.

Recommended for people who wants to enjoy authentic Thai food yet don’t want to break the wallet. Definitely for people who care more about the food than the atmosphere or service.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107964850159037073604/reviews
