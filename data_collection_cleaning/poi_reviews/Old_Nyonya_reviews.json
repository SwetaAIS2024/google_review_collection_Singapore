Tried their Signature Laksa ($5), but it was disappointing—the broth was thin and lacked the richness you’d expect. A premium price would have been fine if the taste delivered, but unfortunately, it didn’t match expectations. There are better options around Maxwell for a satisfying bowl of laksa.",
