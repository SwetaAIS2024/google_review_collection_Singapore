While the service was great and the owner of the place was himself present to ensure perfect arrangements, we were disappointed with the quality of the food. Also, they need to work on improving the infrastructure including toilets. Can‚Äôt share pics to respect privacy of guests so here are food pics.",

When I asked why is he not taking my requests he comes up with the excuse ‚Äúi dont have the songs‚Äù or ‚Äúits going to ruin my flow‚Äù and continues to play absolute garbage.\n\nHe plays his own nonsensical music and honestly just killed the vibes. Not to mention an empty dancefloor while he was spinning. Thankfully the other Djs after him were great.\n\nI feel Magic is a great place to party but Dj Aaron really needs to go üëé",
