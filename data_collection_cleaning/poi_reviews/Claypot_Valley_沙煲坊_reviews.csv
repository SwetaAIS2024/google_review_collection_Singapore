Isaac Sam,5,"This local Zhichar outlet is a fantastic find, especially if you’re after bold, authentic Malaysian flavors! The standout dish here has to be the claypot rice—it’s simply exceptional. The rice has that perfect smoky aroma, and the ingredients are generously portioned, giving each bite a burst of flavor. The claypot lala is another winner, fresh and brimming with a rich, garlicky sauce. Their Iberico pork with mocha sauce is a unique treat, with a surprisingly good balance of flavors. The combination of classic and creative dishes, along with the unmistakably Malaysian taste, makes this a must-visit for anyone craving true comfort food.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108426703400532001032/reviews
Lancer Cs3,5,"2nd visit, this time they change their menu more towards zhi char type of dinner. Food still as nice , especially the curry fish head.

nick tee,5,"Been their supporter since kovan.
Brought my family here to their newly opened 2nd outlet.
Must try their promo dishes, totally worth especially their teochew style Shark's fin with collagen soup and steamd fresh abalone with garlic and vermicelli, both priced at $15.90. sotong balls are crunchy on the outside, q on the inside (sotong cubes), fish soup is fresh and tasty as well.
Will come again to try out other dishes soon!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101556478239684208117/reviews

Clive,5,Nestled in an industrial park. Easy access. Food is to standards. Not air conditioned so can be quite stuffy. Overall good place to go,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113467856219135375887/reviews
