      "text": "I stumbled upon this gem of a wine bar in Asia Sq, and I'm so glad I did. From the moment I walked in, I was struck by the cozy and intimate atmosphere, perfect for a relaxing evening with friends after work. The warm lighting, plush seating and lengthy walk-in wine fridge created a warm and inviting ambiance that made me feel right at home immediately.\n\nBut what truly sets this wine bar apart is the exceptional service. Eve and Zach are knowledgeable, attentive, and passionate about wine. They took the time to understand my preferences and made spot-on recommendations from their extensive list of wines. Speaking of which, the selection is impressive, with a wide range of options from around the world, including some rare and hard-to-find bottles.\n\nThe staff's expertise in Burgundy and Bordeaux wines is unparalleled. They effortlessly guided me through the nuances of each region, sharing fascinating stories and insights that enhanced my appreciation of these iconic wines. Their enthusiasm for wine made sure I leave each visit with new knowledge for the complexities of Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nIf you're a wine enthusiast or just looking for a unique drinking experience, this wine bar is a must-visit. And it‚Äôll most likely won‚Äôt be your last. Cheers üç∑",

Have to basically beg for drinking water and when u ask for an extra glass for your companion they will have the cheek to ask ‚Äò what is your problem?‚Äô It feels as if we are just there to drink free water.. all these happened during off peak hours at 5pm last week.. which is just amazing.. such rude service attitude certainly does not deserve any consumer dollars .. especially not if you brand yourself as a  premium wine bar with premium pricing..\nFor the records, we ordered 3 bottles of wine for the evening.. don‚Äôt come here if u are just ordering 1-2 bottles for sure.. Pls review your cctv and train your staffs or hire more staffs if u guys can‚Äôt cope!",
