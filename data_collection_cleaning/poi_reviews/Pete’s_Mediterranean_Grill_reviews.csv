elrid carvalho,5,"Have been eating at Pete‚Äôs for the last 2.5 years now and there has never been a time I‚Äôve been disappointed, be it the kebabs, the pilaf, the falafel or the hummus, it‚Äôs all cooked and seasoned to perfection.
Tried the latest addition to the menu - the wagyu steak on pilaf and it was simply delicious. I‚Äôd always recommend Pete‚Äôs to anyone who wants a no frills, all taste experience in Joo Chiat.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111977036851709937649/reviews
GA YA,4,"We often go there and like the food albeit a bit pricy for what it is. The falafel with humus is delicious, the beef wrap feels very fresh and simple but so small that it leaves a need to repeat the order (very clever). We did and went for a second wrap with chicken. I must say it was extremely salty and less appetizing than the beef version. All by all a small shop with decent food located in the vibrant Alibaba hawker",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107030149869065027484/reviews
