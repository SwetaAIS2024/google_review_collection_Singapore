The food is fantastic, especially the KFC tacos – a must-try! And the coffee? Absolutely top-notch. It's the kind of place that instantly makes you feel at home. I can't recommend it enough! My wife and I will come back weekly.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116533845989715363595/reviews
Jing Zhi Tan,5,"Popped by for a light lunch and absolutely loved it! Tried the avocado toast and grilled cheese toastie - both were spot on. The avocado was fresh, creamy, and well-balanced with the feta and balsamic, while the toastie came with a comforting tomato soup that made it feel like a warm hug.

Coffee was excellent. One of the best in the area.

The space itself is cozy and calm, with a relaxed vibe that’s perfect for catching up with friends or just enjoying some quiet time. Staff were friendly and attentive.

Definitely one of those hidden gems you want to keep coming back to. Can’t wait to try more from the menu!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105277536234726511716/reviews
Mengxia Sheng,5,"The coffee was excellent - easily one of the better cups I’ve had in a while. Paired it with their awesome homemade brownie, which was rich, fudgy, not overly sweet and just the right amount of indulgent.

My boy is always very picky but he finished the whole plate of beef ragu pasta!

The space is cozy and inviting, perfect for a chill afternoon. Friendly service and good vibes all around.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100986890061444534690/reviews
little emma,5,"Love the cafe menu tried beef ragu pasta, thai basil pork, curry tonkatsu, apple crumble, einspanner coffee and matcha. Food are very affordable and generous. would definitely recommend tonkatsu, coffee and apple crumble. Quite ulu to get by if your not staying nearby but definitely worth the trip down.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100815179517673408704/reviews
