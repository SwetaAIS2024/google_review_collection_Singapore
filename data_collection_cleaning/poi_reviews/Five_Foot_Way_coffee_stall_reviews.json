The taste of the leaves come out well too for its tea, especially when you choose the less sweet option.\n\nA beloved institution amongst residents, who always yearns for his return during his holidays.\n\nWould have given them 6 stars if Google had this option.",

Rarely get iced lemon tea like that from coffee shops. Usually, they are made from that standard commercial syrup. The aunty taking orders was also someone who could joke, not your regular grumpy aunty. ðŸ˜„",
