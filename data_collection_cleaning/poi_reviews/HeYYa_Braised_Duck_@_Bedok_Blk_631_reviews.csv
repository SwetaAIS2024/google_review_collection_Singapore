SG Local Foodie,5,"Visited this store cause I was craving some local traditional dishes and saw people crowding around the store. Traditional braised duck and kway chap from HeYYa was my choice for today.

Went there with my family and we ordered the Braised Duck Rice Set and Kway Chap Set for lunch. Price was affordable and portions were huge compared to many places.

Duck was soft and tender and the intestines from the kway chap was well cleaned and overall braised well. The dishes were super delicious and we ate everything. They are nicer than many other chain or coffee shop braised duck or kway chaps.

Scanned their QR Code and saw that they have 6 more outlets with them being spread around Singapore. Am looking forward to trying the other locations especially during working days.

Will recommend friend, families and colleagues to try this for sure!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114571955582506104924/reviews
Eugene,5,"Ordered a duck meat porridge for only $4.50 while my friends ordered the duck rice set and the duck noodles and we all felt that it was super filling. Large portions and definitely a value for money.

Was impressed with the menu design for a coffee shop with a modern and fun vibe.

Menu was comprehensive with plenty of options for everyone to enjoy. You can choose from Duck Noodles, Kway Chap for 1 or 2 pax, Signature braised duck rice set, porridge, mee sua, pig organ soup and even pork knuckles which is super hard to find at such affordable prices!

We even went back for second servings of the herbal soup which was rich and felt like it was boiled for hours.

This is definitely the place to be and we even spoke to the staff who shared that they have more outlets in Singapore which we will definitely check out soon:)",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112078888437643966054/reviews
Stan Deb,5,"Great taste, had their food at another branch and surprised to find that they opened a new one at Bedok. And it taste just as good! One of the better braised duck around. Meat is tender and sauce is not too salty. KUDOS",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110194120173969340757/reviews
