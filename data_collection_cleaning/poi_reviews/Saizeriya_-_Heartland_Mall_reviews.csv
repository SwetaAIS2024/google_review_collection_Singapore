jayden,4,"Affordable family restaurants or small meet ups with friends. Variety of western food, not top notch food but definitely worth the price. Around $25 for the food in the pics.
All time favourites: Carbonara pasta, Garlic focaccia, Bacon Risotto.
Packed during lunch and dinner peak hours.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
Poco JW,2,"Getting worse and worse.
Cheese wasnâ€™t burned and looks like they just dumped all the leftover cheese/shat cheese they had into the bowl which makes the dish too cheesy and unappetising.

Aglio Olio was not spicy and tasted very blend which seems to be serving u cold noodles from the factory without sauces.

Not enough manpower and have to wait for 5 mins to foot the bill as there was no one at the cashier except some flies.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107041143084658597413/reviews
Richard,4,"Came during peak hours on a weekend. Got a seat quickly. Service is no frills and efficient. Just scan and order via a QR code. Food was served within ten minutes. The chicken salad was especially quick, three minutes!

Chicken Salad: 2/5. While it's relatively cheap, servings were too small and lacked variety. While vegetables and chicken are fresh, the vast majority of vegetables were lettuce with only two cherry tomatoes and a little corn. The chicken meat tasted fine but was tough. Wafu vinaigrette tasted weird and a tad salty.

Milano Gratin & Four Cheese Ravioli: 4/5. Servings of both similarly were too small. Cheese sauce is Saizeriya's strong suit. Though different sauces were used on both dishes, both tasted exceptionally good and creamy. The gratin and ravioli was well simmered in sauce, soft and well cooked.

Black Pepper Chicken: 3/5. The chicken was cooked and tasted like those in glutinous rice.  Spaghetti was typical at best and servings were reasonable.

Japanese Curry Chicken Rice: 4/5. Servings likewise were too small. The dish felt premade and was just heated up. The turmeric rice and curry sauce were decent. The chicken tender strips felt processed and  soggy but otherwise was fine. The chicken and curry sauce was likewise salty too.

Mushroom and Bacon risotto: 4/5. Servings likewise were too small. The carbonara sauce was amazing too but salty, and rice likewise was well simmered in sauce, soft and well cooked.

All in all, I can't complain much given the price. While you don't get exceptional food at Saizeriya, it's good enough for a casual hangout with family and friends without burning your pocket.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117100038111482739455/reviews
Leanette Maxino,1,"Staff was rude, I arrived at 9:20pm, their last order was 9:30pm and closed at 10pm but I was refused to dine-in. I was eating by myself and only would have gotten 1 item and would have finished way before their closing time. The person that refused me as a customer was a manager of the outlet. I think this is unacceptable and your staff needs more training than running an outlet to their own benefit of closing and going home earlier.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112639592208148094814/reviews
Ed Chung,4,"This is a casual family restaurant that we frequent especially this outlet since it's near our home.

The food are nice and prices are relatively reasonable, but it's always crowded especially on weekends.

We came by here for our lunch and as usual, we ordered our regulars, shrimp aglio aglio, pepper chicken, grilled salmon and mushroom bacon pizza. Yum yum. Food were nice. We topped up $2.90 for free flow of cold and hot beverages. We had the ice cream lava cake to complete our meal.

However, there's only one coffee machine and had to queue quite a while for our hot drinks and the milk was very fast depleted, but was not replaced promptly, ended up in our dark black coffee that's so bitter :(

Service staff were generally friendly and helpful but the serving of our food were not in tandem. Some were served pretty quick, others had to wait quite a while and by the time they came, we already finished our mains!

Overall, we enjoyed our dinning as it is without GST and service charge!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105056380002360483849/reviews
