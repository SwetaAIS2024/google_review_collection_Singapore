sharon,1,"Recently we went to this place for the first. We were served by this sales representative  from a Malaysian auntie with pony tail. She promoted us to get 3 tower with 1 tower free for only $179 instead of $88 for 1 tower. We clarified a few times with her before confirming our orders. However when we received our bills, we were shocked that we were charged $88*3 with GST ++. We went on to clarify but the person who served us was rather aggressive in justifying. Therefore, Please check your bills before proceeding the payment. I will never come back to such places with such unethical sales tactic. FYI, we left the place very sober.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102070682534012535035/reviews
