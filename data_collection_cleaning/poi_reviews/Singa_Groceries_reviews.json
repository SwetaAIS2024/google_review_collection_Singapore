Also, the highlight is that they sell things comparatively at low price when compared to other mini marts and shops and one can witness that when they shop there..Also,  there's no compromise in the quality of the products...Veggies were super fresh...it's almost like a onestop shop and 5 stars to their customer service....Highly recommend!!!!!",
