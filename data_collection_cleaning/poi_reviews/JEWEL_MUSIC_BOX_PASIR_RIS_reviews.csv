Low Bao Heng,4,"Food: there‚Äôs only 3 options for the tidbits thus not really impressed even though it‚Äôs free flow just like it‚Äôs soft drinks / hot beverages.

Service: once u paid money, settle down, then it‚Äôs self-service. No menu in the room to order food so basically u have to order via the cashier out there. The food we ordered is small in portion, taste average and kinda not worth it. But they have an interesting item on the menu: Fish Skin in rojak sauce. Not bad.

Atmosphere: Good. Got open area for singer wannabe, if not get a room and sing privately with your family and friends. üòÖ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108033403024309465290/reviews
