      "text": "1.\tChicken Chop with Sweet Potato Fries and Salad\nThe chicken chop was juicy and full of flavor—definitely the highlight of the meal. The sweet potato fries were a nice touch, crispy with a hint of sweetness. The salad was fresh and balanced the dish well.\n2.\tWaffle with Ice Cream\nThe waffle was decent, but the ice cream on top was amazing—rich, creamy, and really hit the spot. The syrup added just the right amount of sweetness.\n3.\tSmoked Salmon Salad\nThe salad looked great and had fresh ingredients, but the overall taste was pretty average. A light and healthy option, though!\n\nWhat really stood out, though, was the super friendly staff. Their warm service made the experience even better!",

      "text": "The food service was excellent, with the staff going above and beyond to help us celebrate a birthday for one of my friend. We bought a small slice of cake from them and they provided us a candle.\n\nThe atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, ideal for a small celebration as there wasn’t much crowd when we went over. However, I felt that the salmon was overly salty and didn’t pair well with the pasta, affecting the overall flavor. With better seasoning and a better balance of flavors, the meal could be greatly improved. The other food though was great! :)",
