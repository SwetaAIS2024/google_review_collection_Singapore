      "text": "This is the 2nd time I gone back to Spring Leaf at Jalan Tua Kong for the curry fish head. Love the curry spice and they gave the whole fish head, not half. At the Jalan Tua Kong branch, they have a set deal for the fish head which makes it pretty worthwhile. Not sure if all the branches offer the same deal. The fish head is good for 3-4 people to share. I love to eat it with the crispy egg prata. Perfect combination!!\n\nMy family was also warmly welcome by one of the servers (Ms. Raji) that suggested to us that she will placed the fish head curry order first as it takes about 25mins to cook. And later asked if we would like all our food to be serve at the same time. That way, my whole family are able to dine together and enjoy the warm food.",
