Customers don't pay for your salary, your boss does. Please change your attitude towards everyone judging from all the newer comments here.",

      "text": "Bad experience with the lady serving who has a sulky attitude who does not open her mouth at all when I placed my order for pizza. She just type on the cashier n without saying a single thing I hv to look at the total price on the counter screen. Then after collecting the payment she just leave the receipt n the beeping counter without any words. On collecting my item again she doesn't even say thank you n when I wanted to ask for utensils, she has oredi turned away. I'm entirely confused if tis lady is the boss or a staff cos her behaviour is totally not acceptable in selling service line. The pizza I ordered is hawaian twister n it's cold inside like it's not fully baked. Pineapple is cold is ok cos it's freshly placed on top but not the pizza. Will definitely not return to GoPizza at all.",
