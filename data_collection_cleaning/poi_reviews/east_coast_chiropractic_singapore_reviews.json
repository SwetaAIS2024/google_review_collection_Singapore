      "text": "A friendly and honest chiropractor.\n\nBeing an active person especially lifting heavy stuff, I had developed an uneasiness on my upper back and neck. This matter had persisted for a year and had been harder given the nature of my job of having to sit in front of my wheel for 12 till 14 hours a day which had also caused me to develop a stiff neck. This had caused me to seek a chiropractor to treat my problem. After seeking treatment from Dr. Greg for twice, there is much relieve as the holistic approach he gave which involve adjustments to treat me. All of my problems were gone after the 4th treatment. This clinic is highly recommended for people that are having the same problem as me which involves sports injuries and stiff neck. The price is very reasonable as well given the value that this clinic provides.\n\nPros:\n1. Reasonable pricing\n2. Professional treatment (solves all related issues)\n3. Strategically located\n4. Friendly and honest chiropractor\n\nTreated by: Dr Greg McRae",
