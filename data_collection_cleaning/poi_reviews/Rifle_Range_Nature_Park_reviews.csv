D T (琳),5,"Very nice park with a combination of boardwalk and forest trail, and some uphill elevation gain to a viewing deck! We walked across the overhead bridge to the entrance of the park from Beauty world shopping centre hawker center level. On a hot day, the trail was partially shaded. The Quarry wetland was small and nothing nice about it. After the wetland the trail begins some elevation climb to the viewing deck which added some fun to this trail. You can do a loop from the viewing deck back to the entrance, or continue further to the macritchie trail. We didnt see much wildlife. I was impressed with the number of security cameras along the trail. You can also drive in and park at the parking along rifle range road.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112267041964899367669/reviews

DaX Toh,5,Nice breezy treetop walk to see the granite quarry as well as the secondary forest. No cycling or scooting is allowed on the trail. Make sure you have good walking shoes on. Many encounters with squirrels and monkeys. Make sure you ain’t holding plastic bags with food as the monkeys will notice and attack. End off the walk with some good local fare with the beauty world food centre.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110795556109846185546/reviews
Choon Kiat Wang,5,"As a buffer park, it is quieter than the nearby BTNR and quite well maintained. There are multiple trails to explore and good for walks between 1 and 3 hours.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115007836108322048628/reviews
Ahmad Sukri,5,Went hiking this morning. Amazing place for those looking for a scenic guided walk. The trails are mostly broadwalks (good accessibility) and less rocky paths. The deck is worth climbing up for. Look out flora and fauna around !,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108599395358482451193/reviews
