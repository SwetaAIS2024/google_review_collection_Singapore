Jasmin Wong,5,The therapists are all very attentive to the needs of my skin. There is no hard-selling: whatever they suggest has been very beneficial for my skin. My acne-prone skin has seen very significant improvement since I have started my journey with Sandy Beauty in Jan 2023. Breakouts are minimal now. The products they suggest have been very beneficial to my skin's healing and rejuvenation. Highly recommend Sandy Beauty. :),a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117895776717850177953/reviews

Debbie Chan,5,"I recently visited Sandy Beauty Centre and followed their recommended skincare package along with using their recommended skincare products. I must say that the results have been quite impressive.

After a week of following the regimen, I noticed that my skin has become noticeably more supple and less congested. The texture of my skin has improved, and I've experienced a reduction in blemishes and congestion, which has been a persistent concern for me.

Overall, my experience at Sandy Beauty Centre has been positive, and I am delighted with the results I've achieved so far. I would certainly recommend their services and products to anyone looking to improve the health and appearance of their skin.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113580106471728941482/reviews
