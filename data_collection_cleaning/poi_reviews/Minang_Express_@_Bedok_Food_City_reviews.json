      "text": "Just amazing. Words can't describe the taste or feeling I got when I had the Ayam Goreng Belado Hijau Set. I was like \"wow\" every single bite, you could ask my colleague! You have to try it yourself. What I can say is that the Ayam Goreng was freshly prepared and cooked. It's as though I stole some Fried Chicken when my mom is still cooking hehe. The Begedil was the same. The Gulai Pucuk Ubi was moist and delicious. A good combination topped with Belinjau Crackers. It's oh so good, I'll definitely have it again for lunch!",

      "text": "Tapau-ed the Ayam Belado Hijau set for dinner from here. Was still quite warm after 1 hour, which is surprising. Price is quite decent, $7.80 including the container. The set includes rice, veg, egg, chicken, sambal and keropok. Not the best quality of container but won't complain for the price. Tastewise, the ayam belado is delicious and don't even need the sambal belacan heat. The worker also was kind enough to provide additional gravy after requesting. Highly recommend the ayam belado hijau",

The best part was the food is still warm yet fresh and ready to eat immediately especially for dinner @ 8pm which I love as I don't have to heat up the dishes normally.\n\nCongratulations to Minang Express new opening!ðŸŽ‰\nOn a side note: if you are not sure what dishes to put in together for nasi padang, here is the place for you to have their recommended padang sets.",
