Kwong Fei Yee,5,"Went to try out this particular GHK 645 coffeeshop during breakfast. The next door Pak Mandor Nasi Lemak get all the attention. However, don't look down on this simple Unforgettable Noodle.

The noodle is cooked just nice and comes with nice sauce. When ask for extra pork lard, they happily gives too. Overall a nice experience.

Can try! :)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118030178376808365901/reviews
