Especially during ramadhan, where kampong gelam has food bazaar. The hotel also 3 minutes from Sultan Mosque.. I stay 5 nights",

Also, there were no shelves in the bathroom so it was difficult to place my toiletries anywhere in the bathroom. Also, it was quite noisy - people slamming doors. The plus point is that the bed was quite comfortable and the location is good. Other than that, I did not get enough sleep for the nights I stayed here because of the noises (even with earplugs).",
