The Bobo was good and refreshing after a hot bike ride. The marshmallow waffle was the best my daughter has ever had she said. The takoyaki was steaming hot with octopus tentacles. Good sized seating area overlooking the runway 1 (02L/20R). The young girl working that afternoon was friendly and efficient. Will come again with the toddler.",
