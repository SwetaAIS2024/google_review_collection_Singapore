Blue Jellyfish,4,"I have always love coming to this place.. simple fishing jetty.

After a short ride stopover, I hope this place can be brought to its previous conditions and kampung aura, with shops, restaurants and even the pisang goreng stall.

I can see that development will soon take away the greens of this area.  Sad....

To the Pendas residents.. I love your modern houses above the waters!

Lets keep Pendas jetty as it is!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117746462766877799232/reviews

Kevin Mohd,3,"Was here to take a chartered boat for onboard a ship nearby. Bit far from the main road yet still a safe drive. No toilet , no retail shop nearby : so do be ready when nature's call. Morning time got small warung selling decent food , stalls selling fresh fish and produce. The seafood restaurant was said to be ok yet unsure of price & qualities.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102934516430179351877/reviews
Yusri Sallim,4,The location of this Jetty is quite isolated and this area will be buzzing of activities especially weekend. You can even  buy fresh catch of the day from the fisherman house and some are straight out from the ocean,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111010060912426109117/reviews
