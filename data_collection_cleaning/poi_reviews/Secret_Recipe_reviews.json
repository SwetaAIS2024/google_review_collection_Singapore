      "text": "The menu offers a diverse selection of Asian and Western dishes, and the portions are quite generous. The lamb shank is normal, quite a big portion. The meat is tender and surprisingly served quickly. The chicken parmigiana is average, using chicken thighs that aren’t ideal for this dish, but the tomato and cheese combination is fine. The spaghetti in tomato sauce and chicken meat balls is presented nicely and tastes quite good. The pasta olio oglio came last, with a seafood seasoning that was a bit too salty, but otherwise it was decent.\n\nThe ordering system using QR codes isn’t very smooth and doesn’t load properly. This could be improved.\n\nOverall, it’s a good place for a normal, average meal. However, the cake seems to be quite popular at secret recipe.",

Can consider to propose installing a canopy to block out some UV...",

Food wise I would say there are probably at about the same level as Swensen's. The mushroom soup and garlic bread were serviceable but nothing to write home about, the nasi Goreng with fried chicken though was elevated to pretty good thanks to its tangy and spicy sambal paste. The rice and chicken were pretty average, portions were adequate but thats about all the positives i can think of. The ice lemon tea was average as well. Will I come back again? Maybe if I wanna try someone their other dishes, would be good if they sold that sambal in a jar, I would definitely buy that.",

By the way, the lunch menu is also very good. Convenient system of entering the order office via qr code and paying by card or cash. Coffee was very tasty. Now every time we go shopping in Plaza Singapura we will drink coffee here.",
