      "text": "Tucked away in Punggol, this remote bakery lives up to its hype for sourdough—crusty exterior, stretchy, chewy crumb, and a tangy depth that rivals Singapore’s best. The Diversity Board Platter (a mix of cheeses, mushroom pate, beetroot hummus, and dips) was enjoyable, but the plain sourdough alone with some olive oil stole the show; its simplicity outshined even the fanciest accompaniments.\n\nCarrot cake was moist, very chunky, and spiced just right, while the raspberry marshmallow cookie (soft-bake style) caters to those who favor gooey centers. The menu’s sourdough pastas and brunch items looked tempting, but we’ll save those for next time. Ambiance is a serene retreat—modern wabi-sabi decor with earthy tones, soft lighting, and curated playlists that strike a chill-but-energetic balance. Staff are warm and knowledgeable, adding to the welcoming vibe.\n\nA gem for sourdough devotees and a peaceful escape from the city bustle. Worth the travel to Punggol—come hungry, leave carb-loaded, and don’t skip the bread!",

      "text": "Anna has always been a favorite spot of mine, thanks to its inviting ambience and consistently warm service. The staff here are welcoming, and the cozy vibe makes it a great place to unwind. The food, as always, is flavorful and well-prepared—not much complaints there!\n\nHowever, as a frequent patron, I’ve noticed the portion sizes have gradually become smaller, particularly the soup. What’s served now is barely half a bowl, which pales in comparison to the image advertised on the menu. While I understand rising costs may lead to price adjustments (which they’ve implemented), the combination of smaller portions *and* higher prices feels disappointing.\n\nTheir sourdough loaf used to be $17-19 is now $24. I can understand. But some stuff is not about raising cost and reducing the portion.\n\nI truly enjoy dining here and want to continue supporting Anna, but this trend makes it hard to justify the value. I hope the team can revisit portion consistency or pricing to match the quality experience they’re known for. Fingers crossed for improvement—I’d hate to reduce my visits over this!",

      "text": "The sourdough bread is nice, 5 stars. The other ingredients tho.. mushroom soup is not so memorable. Soupstar’s mushroom soup is much better but it’s $16++ vs. less than half the price. Duck confit was not good.. both of us didn’t like it. Not very tender.. risotto also not v good. Sour dough pizza is the best. Liked the sausage tho I normally don’t like sausage. Meatball is okok. $40-$50 per person",

      "text": "I have been wanting to try Anna's Sourdough and had a okay-okay experience! They had plenty of options but since we came in the afternoon, we didn't get to try the pizza as it was available only at 5pm.\nWe tried the diversity board and it was good. 3 different types of bread, with crispy crust, and the inside is soft and tangy. The flavours of the \"spread/sauce\" is rich and slightly sour all have their own unique taste.\nSteak & fries was excellent but the sauce given was not to my liking.\nService was greatz\nThe atmosphere was cozy and inviting. Definitely recommend!",
