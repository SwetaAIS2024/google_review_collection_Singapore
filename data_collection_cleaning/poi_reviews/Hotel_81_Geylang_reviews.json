      "text": "I recently stayed at this hotel in Geylang, Singapore, for five days. The building is quite old, and the rooms reflect that with outdated air conditioning, lighting, and bathroom fittings. The overall condition of the rooms is average, and the doors still use traditional keys instead of modern RFID cards.\n\nNo bottled water is provided, so you’ll need to rely on tap water for drinking. If you book online, you’ll likely be charged more than if you book directly at the hotel. I recommend booking in person to save some money.\n\nIf you’re looking for a budget-friendly option for a short stay, this hotel could be a consideration. The staff were friendly, but there isn’t much else noteworthy about the experience.",

      "text": "STAY AWAY! I was travelling solo, needed one night in Singapore for a layover and unfortunately chose this one. Reception appears clean and orderly. I asked to see room first and it looked clean as did the bathroom. Staff assured me my room would be quiet. So I took a chance and booked it. Around 9pm I walked out to get some food, and noticed what appeared to be a prostitute in the reception area. Outside, dodgy characters and other ladies of the night were hanging around. Returned around 10pm, and went to bed around 11pm. But no sleep - too noisy. Walls paper thin. People banging and talking loudly. Then around 1am I started to have itchy legs, and this didn't go away. At 6am the cleaners start yelling and banging with no regard for guests. Got some sleep somehow between 7am and 8am. Woke up, legs still itching, I looked up Trip Advisor (what I should have done before booking) and to my horror read stories of other people with itching. Seems these beds are full of bedbugs - seems this hotel is the kind of place that men take prostitutes - which explained the noise all night. I jumped out of bed and checked under my doona to find hairs that weren't mine. I had a shower immediately, packed and left. As I walked out a lady was screaming at the top of her voice in what sounded like a bad fight. Couldn't wait to get out of here. The lying thugs at reception who said it was a quiet hotel should be ashamed of themselves. Please - DO NOT stay here - you're better of finding a chair at the airport to sleep on, or a gutter to sleep in.",
