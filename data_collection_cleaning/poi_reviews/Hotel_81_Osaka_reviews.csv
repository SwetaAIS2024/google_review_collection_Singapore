Matthew Iwama,5,"Honestly, great budget hotel in Singapore. Small but really quiet. Close to Outram Park. No gym, no restaurant - just a quiet room with good shower. What more do you want?

Anna Lo,1,"I really wouldn’t recommend this hotel, especially for families. The service was incredibly slow—I had to ask multiple times just to get fresh towels. The bathroom smelled awful, and there were mosquitoes all over the room, which made it hard to relax.

It felt more like a love hotel. The worst part was the noise—around 3 AM, people in the room next door were ""doing it"", and it was so loud it kept me up. If you’re looking for a peaceful stay, this is definitely not the place. I won’t be coming back.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105283991689129828279/reviews
Kim Albo-Johnson,5,"Great location. We were within walking distance to many restaurants, shopping and Chinatown. The staff here is great. They are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but worked great for us since we weren't really in them. We spent most of our time adventuring.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106421809175243756831/reviews
Châu Đinh,4,"Near the bus station, about 5 minute walking
Not too near the mrt, it’ll take you 15 minutes of walking. Near a very safe, friendly and peaceful community area, it’ll be great if you can take time to walk around in the morning.

The room is kinda small, but you’re gonna wander outside around all day so perhaps it’s not a big problem. With this kind of price, I have no complain. The room is clean. Room service is always available when we ask for it.

Dont worry about the AC problems that other reviewers said, you can control the AC by your own in your room, no need to talk to the receptionist",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103251688683146033924/reviews
Rumahku Syurga,5,We always frequently have short stays at this hotel due to our jobs. Hotel 81 Osaka is near to our workplace and its super clean. There is nothing to complain about the hotel except for the aircon which sometimes goes to temps that can't be adjust and its control by the lobby. The best point about this Hotel 81 Osaka is that they have the best friendliest staff. One staff name James always try his best to accommodate to our request. KUDOS to all the staff of Hotel 81 Osaka!!!,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100674030577490445570/reviews
