Benjamin Tay,1,"Hopelessly slow. Ordered via grab at 6:12pm for a Saturday dinner. The initial estimated delivery was 7:10 to 7:25pm(which was already slow enough). They kept pushing back the estimated delivery time until 8:05pm. I cancelled my order after one hour.

Maybe I should not have cancelled my order. At the rate that they are going, maybe i would have received my food just in time for my supper.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102661880107371937584/reviews

Siew Yee Tang,1,"Ordered via Grab Kitchen, after accepting the order, it says the delivery time delayed by 1/2 hr.

nora lailatul akma abdul rahim,1,I bought it by shopee food and I already gave 5 stars before eating it.. the saddest thing is that the chic tenders are rotten and the chicken takes a long time to open. It smells bad.. do you really have a sense of smell? You can eat it.. fast service but unfortunately the food is rotten.. please do the job sincerely.. the food is good.. I am indeed boycotting you.. I swear I can't eat at all!,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118307097810920105627/reviews
