shadykdot,5,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Victoria Hotel - A Nuve Group Collection, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in so many ways! From the moment I checked in, I immediately felt the warm and welcoming atmosphere that truly sets this hotel apart.

The accommodations were comfortable, clean, and thoughtfully designed — exactly what you would hope for at this price point. The room was well-equipped with everything I needed for a relaxing stay, including comfortable bedding, a modern bathroom, and thoughtful little touches that made it feel like a home away from home. The hotel’s overall aesthetic is charming and cozy, with a great location that makes it very convenient to explore the area.

But what truly made my stay memorable was the exceptional service. I especially want to commend Sheryl, one of the staff members who went above and beyond to ensure I had everything I needed. Sheryl’s professionalism, friendliness, and genuine care for the guests reflect everything this hotel stands for. She embodies the kind of service that makes a huge difference — always ready to assist with a smile, providing helpful recommendations, and making sure that my experience was seamless from start to finish.

Thanks to Sheryl and the entire Victoria Hotel team, my stay felt like true value for money. It’s rare to find a place that offers such a perfect balance of affordability, comfort, and outstanding service. I would not hesitate to recommend Victoria Hotel to anyone looking for a pleasant and affordable stay, and I look forward to returning in the future!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109301630297245414443/reviews
