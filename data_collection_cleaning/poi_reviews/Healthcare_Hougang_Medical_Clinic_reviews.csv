Shi Hou Sheares Lim,5,"Doc Lim is very gentle and professional and he takes effort to explains to you. Have visited for years and seen Doc Lim since he took over from the previous doctor.

The counter staff are all very nice also especially one of the short hair lady. They know all of their regulars well, sometimes they may seem to be more fierce with the customers but those are actually customers they know and you have to be more firm with them.

The charges are reasonable which is why many people visit and thus making the waiting time long. Used to accept only cash but they are ok for you to pay the balance on another day if you are a bit short but recently seems to include other form of payment.

A small and simple clinic but professional and got ‰∫∫ÊÉÖÂë≥.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100409931043814336087/reviews
None of your business,5,"I had seem quite a lot's of private GP.
He is one of a only few only excellent doctors i seem:
*Professionalism
*politeness
*very patience listening to you and checking out your body conditions.
*Very cute looking to me (sorry to say that)

*But waiting time was long (as expected, good doctor = lot of patient's)
but worth the wait and price was reasonable.
