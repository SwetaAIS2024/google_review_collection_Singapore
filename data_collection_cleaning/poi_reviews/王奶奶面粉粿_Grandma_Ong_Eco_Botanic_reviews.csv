dolce bibobi,4,"Simple but delicious food in the Eco Botanic area. Second time visiting already. Soup is light and delicious. They use the traditional mani vegetables in the soup.

Noodle bowls come in three sizes which is a great system for people with varying appetites. Also recommend getting the meal option, very good value for money.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113755863430044252682/reviews
yeexuan ong,1,Really disappointed. I found a dead snail in the food I ordered today. This is a serious hygiene issue. I honestly have no idea how a snail ended up in my food. It really makes me doubt whether the vegetables were properly cleaned.Hope the store improves but I won‚Äôt be visiting again.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100323724413301062858/reviews

ÊòØÊó†Âêç,4,"Nice place to have a meal.  Plenty of options for types of noodles,  the soup base,  the dry or soup version.

There's side dishes which are nice

Overall,  reasonable place to visit for meal.  Price is reasonable. However,  salt level to me is a little too high.  The branch needs to bring down the salt level in the dishes that's why I am giving 3 stars.

Service,  they were prompt. However I see the servers are very busy as there's no Trays or trolley for them and so they have to take the dishes or drinks one by one.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105456352515293598037/reviews
