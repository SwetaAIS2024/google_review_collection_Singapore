Victoria Ho,5,"We ordered the
- Signature big prawn noodles $11.90 - Absolutely delicious. The big prawns was super fresh and sweet. The pork slices were tender and the soup base is superb! Disposal gloves provided so yeah!

- Classic Prawn Noodles $8.90 - we had the dry version with a nice sweet and savour sauce. This version uses a regular size prawn and is partially peeled already.

Also tried the Golden Prawn Roll side dish that came with yummy chilli!

Overall really love the freshness of the Prawns, prawns ball and the broth was super good. Rich and flavourful with no after effects like thirstiness!

100% retuning for more! Highly recommended!

Loh Soon Shan,5,"Tried Hae! Mee at Chai Chee Industrial Park and loved it. You can customise everything—big or regular prawns, yellow noodles, kway teow, or mee hoon, dry or soup—and the broth is rich and flavourful. Don’t skip their sides: the Signature Fried Prawn and Golden Prawn Pancake were crispy and addictive. Hawker space is clean with plenty of seating despite the crowd. Great find for prawn-mee fans!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114194136783291087444/reviews

Violet Chan,5,"Brought my fam to dine at Hae!mee last Friday evening. It was a media tasting invite, and I'm so glad that we went! We had the Signature Big Prawn Noodles and Classic Prawn Noodles. The broth was comforting - briny wotha hint of sweetness. Noodles were well cooked, al dente with a nice bite. Overall, highly recommended!! Your taste buds and tummy will be super satisfied!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116630992424556162827/reviews
