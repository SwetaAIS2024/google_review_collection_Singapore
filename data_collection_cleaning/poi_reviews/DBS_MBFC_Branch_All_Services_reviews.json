      "text": "The customer service for corporate banking has been extremely disappointing. I have had to visit this branch three times to clear the GIRO form yet still not clear.\n\n1st attempt: The form was rejected because an ink signature was required. This is understandable.\n\n2nd attempt: It was rejected because the bank code needed to be 001 instead of 081. The issue arose when the attendant, Logen, explained that the 001 code in bank account section has to replace the 081 in the bank code section. However, he failed to clarify that 001 needed to be used in both bank code section and bank account section. This misunderstanding caused unnecessary delays, leading to a third and potentially fourth attempt.\n\n3rd attempt: The form was rejected again, this time because, in addition to using 001 as the bank code, it was required to be placed at the bank account section as well. This was explained by the attendant, Wendy.\n\nFor all three attempts, the documents were brought and reviewed in their office, yet each time a different mistake was pointed out. Why were the same document being reviewed repeatedly without catching these issues beforehand? This indicates a flaw in the operational process.\n\nOverall, this experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing.\nI will rate zero star if there is an option.",

So it is indeed a rare occasion to travel to an on-site branch. To my surprise, after weeks of frustration talking to the DBS BusinessCare consultants on the phone, I finally had the chance to meet Zafirah, who patiently listened to my grievances and worked with me to try and get them rectified.\n\nI am glad that even in an increasingly digital world, DBS still has employees like Zafirah who are willing to go the extra mile to provide the personal touch in helping long-time customers resolve difficulties in their day to day banking.",
