But I go home the internet banking I cannot login, but I can login via my phone.\n\nIf the internet banking has so much issue, I really rather have a bank book, and not this nonsense. It is cheaper than BOC having to mail me, and pay so much money for stamps.\n\nI be honest compared to UOB and OCBC the graphics of your app is at least a 5 year gap. And if you can't give customers something they feel they can trust, provide an alternative. I do not feel safe when your graphics look the way they do.",
