      "text": "Basic Sailing Course - Absolutely Amazing Experience at Constant Wind!\n\nRobert, our Basic Sailing Course instructor, was exceptional - fun, knowledgeable, and passionate about teaching. His hands-on approach meant we spent maximum time on the water, which made the learning process both efficient and enjoyable. The practical learning style was perfect - we jumped straight into sailing on a Laser Bahia on day one, getting real experience with the instructor and fellow students. Day two saw us progressing to solo sailing on the Laser Pico, which was an incredible confidence builder. We even got to watch the Saturday races - an exciting bonus to see the pros!\n\nThe location at East Coast Park is ideal for beginners, with steady winds and calm waters perfect for learning. The equipment was well-maintained, and the progression from group sailing to individual practice was thoughtfully structured. If you're looking to get into sailing in Singapore, this is definitely the place to start. You'll get plenty of actual sailing time rather than just theoretical knowledge, and you'll leave with practical skills and a real taste for the sport.",

His expertise, patience, and clear instructions made it easy to progress quickly while having a ton of fun.\n\nHe broke down complex techniques in a way that was easy to understand and gave me the confidence to get up on the foil in no time.\n\nI highly recommend him to anyone looking to improve their skills or get started with wind foiling. Can‚Äôt wait for my next session!",

Recently signed up for their basic Stand.Up.Paddling course and boy did we enjoyed it to the maxx.!! Trained under Coach Wali, he was fun.. patient and precise.!! Plus he is a damn good photographer too, Coach Wali took photos of us while we were out with him in the open sea so that we each get some fun memories to take home after training.!\nRegrettably, i gotten sea.sick towards the end of the course and within seconds, Coach Wali was right infront of mi and towed mi + my board back to shore.!! One thing you can be assured is CW has the best team and top notch coaches to guide you for whatever course you signed up for.! They do Sailing and Windsurfing courses as well.!",

They explained everything very nicely. The sail boats were in excellent condition. Loved my time there. They have a cafe there which has some good options for food and drinks. Nice place to chill as well.",
