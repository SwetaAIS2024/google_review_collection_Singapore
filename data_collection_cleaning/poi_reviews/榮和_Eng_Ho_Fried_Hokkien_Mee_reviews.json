Lastly, i find the noodle a bit too wet but it's just personal preference as I find the stock not thick enough. Lastly, i queued for around 40mins, don't think it's worth such a long wait. If it's around 15mins then I am more willing to come again.",

      "text": "After some quick research, I found one of the more famous HKM stalls in Ang Mo Kio which I havent tried.\n\nCame at 830pm on a weekday and the waiting time was 15-20min. I noticed it's one of the most frequented stalls here at this time of the day.\n\nCan taste the old school flavor in its broth, not as intense or savory like the new HKM entrants, but definitely a bit of nostalgia you can taste in every bite. Their rendition does not come with pork lard nor pork slices, but the prawns are succulent. Pic shows $6 plate.\n\nDo note Eng Ho requires only cash payment and their ingredients include tau gey, not sure if you can opt out, but for me, I am partial to the sprout so I never asked. I also appreciate that they use the Q buzzer system so you don't have to stand in line.",

Not too wet and yet the noodles were soaked with the prawn broth nicely with wok hey. Adding lime to it makes it even more appealing. The sua lo prawns were super fresh.\n\nWill definitely visit again.",
