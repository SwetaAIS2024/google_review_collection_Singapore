      "text": "They only accept cash and that’s the key reason causing the long queuing time! And don’t be alarmed if you see some of the customers rushing back to their friends/family to get the cash.\nThe price is reasonable and they have so many  varieties for us to choose. The food was fresh but they were too heavily and bluntly seasoned, and I could only taste salt, (lots of)peppers, oyster sauce and msg. The ambience was very nice with the live band performance. I would advise to go there early especially if you drive. They don’t have enough parking space, most cars had to park illegally along the double-lined roadside.",
