Zelda Chen,5,"My kids had a really fun immersive experience learning from Benedict! They're still raving about the VR art lesson and pestering for more ðŸ˜†
Ben was very clear in his instruction and in teaching the technique of painting virtually. He also handled the kids with their antics professionally. Would highly recommend anyone (young or old) to give it a try!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103482259763121442053/reviews
