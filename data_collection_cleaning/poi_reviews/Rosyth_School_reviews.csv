JIANHUA JIN,5,After 6 years i can assure yall that this is an excellent school. Almost all facilities are new and there is a makerspace where students can build lego watch movies and use 3d pens! The library also offers a wide variety of books. Teachers are also very skilled at teaching(most of them).Great school for your child.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105001721236327045200/reviews
djejilke,5,"The teachers teach rlly well and are quite approachable. They encourage students to approach them if in doubt, and they rlly want us to improve. They can be a bit too strict at times, but overall they are good teachers.

Most of the students are nice. Some students are quite toxic though.

The facilities are really nice, and the canteen food is very good!!
The food is so good, only when I left primary school then I truly appreciated the deliciousness of the food in Rosyth. Canteen stall owners are also really nice, once I was ten cents short, and they still let me have the food.

The only thing that is bad is the new princiap, he dosent really care about the students and teachers well being, and cancelled most of the post psle activities for the P6 cohort. I wish the old principal could have stayed.

Overall great school, just the new principal is bad.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116277011868972652792/reviews
kayden goh,5,"grad class of 2023, all I can say is to those haters, we've done the best we can. the school has a indoor sports hall lvl 1, a multipurpose hall lvl4, a tiny room for assembly on lvl 6, a parade square, a field, a canteen at level 6, and even a childcare centre. what's there not to love? the teachers are so kind and patient, and they take discipline seriously.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110077328761904062712/reviews
Jonas Anderson,1,"Refuse to answer much, but I think that the approach to the discipline is slightly.. odd, to say the least. The principal had accused my younger brother of ‘hiding behind his defences’, such because although he had done some disrespect to staff, the principal apparently threatened him with severe punishments, note, he is also diagnosed with mild autism, and although he is in the wrong, he requires more gentle guidance, not mindless shouting!
I see why, but he has a record of doing this before, because he is oppressed at home by my parents. They normally favour me over my brother, being the latter, which is in P6. So a summary, sibling had done wrong, slightly too extreme of a punishment, being a suspension, and he confessed to me, that he wanted to kill himself.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102202642256529504022/reviews
Ahzv Bsbbnn,5,"My daughter is in this school and she really enjoys learning, she is a student counselor and the teachers are not strict but they are firm. The teachers are kind and patient with the students. There are also a lot of fun learning journeys where the students have lots of fun exploring the place. My eldest son had just graduated with flying colours from this school,
Thank you rosyth school.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111584109272079374665/reviews
