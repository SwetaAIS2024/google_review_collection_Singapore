jayden,2,"Squid is not worth the price at all for $15! It's literally just tasted like boiled or steamed?? Although it's grilled but totally no grilled taste or texture at all... The sauce to go with the squid also doesn't taste nice at all, I assume it's just those bottled sauce as it's tasted  so.... I would expect a way better quality for such prices....this tasted really too off and effortless in cooking.
Overall 2 stars as the counter staff still quite friendly. But definitely a 1 star for the squid.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
Ying Kai Ong,1,"Disgusted by what I got - 8 dollars for this. Literally egg and white rice. There’s nothing in the dish , charred egg that’s haphazardly fried. When I returned the dish, the lady was sounded so self righteous, said that because of high rent  they cannot give more, and pointed to the menu to defend how transparent it is price- literally said omelette and rice. Nobody would expect this quality for 8 dollars. And one shouldn’t use high rent to justify poor quality food.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104313279702452732254/reviews
J Koh,3,"Was underwhelming, the location was a bit too ulu not to drive, not alot of parking spaces. Had coffee and dessert there, so can't comment on the food. Venue was instagrammable but the loud music and people chattering over it, on top of the loud noise from the plane flying off gets abit too much after a while.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103331239252894299165/reviews
