Roland Lim,4,"Update on 21 Jan 2025: this pasta stall cook‚Äôs last day of operation is 24 Jan 2025. A few more days if you want to try the pasta.

Sometimes I‚Äôve the Salmon pasta üçù (regular) with Aglio olio, add-ons; broccoli ü•¶ tomato üçÖ onsen egg ü•ö$11.10 for a nice healthy lunch.

If just the Salmon pasta (regular) only costs $8.80.

On another day I had the Chicken pasta (regular size) with Aglio Olio sauce, added broccoli ü•¶ tomatoes üçÖ onsen egg ü•ö costs me $9.10. Yummy üòã",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104552402181664287079/reviews
Gaston Liew,5,"My first time here and wasn't sure what to get, was served by a very friendly and helpful part time staff, Charis. She helped me get a quick understanding of the menu and recommended to me her personal favourite - fried fish soup, which I really enjoyed! Fish fried to perfection and good amount of vegetables in the soup to add that natural sweetness. Ordered the toast set too that came with a good amount of Kaya and I liked the doneness of the eggs as well! It was nice that I can change my drink to yuanyang with no additional charge too! Will definitely come back again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107287424835681061776/reviews
Benedict Chua,5,"Honestly, this has one of the best fried fish in Singapore. Very rarely do fish soup sellers allow the seperation of the fried fish and the soup, but this is one of them.

The fried fish is able to retain its crispy outer batter, along with the natural juices of the fish that pops in your mouth when eaten. Amazing fried fish that can be eaten on its own.

The downside is their soup is not very flavourful. It is clean, probably because it is near the hospital and has dietary standards it adheres to, but the soup has a strong vegetable taste compared to a savoury seafood broth taste that good fish soups have. Overall, +1 and -1",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111915063884081471920/reviews

Joe Ong,4,"Nice kopi-c kosong.

They have a variety of breakfast set (from traditional soft boiled egg and bun set to noodles)

For lunch, they have fish soup with rice or noodles (Tom yam or clear or milk), salad bowl, chicken rice, and sweet and sour fish. The cost is acceptable as well, rarely going above 6 dollars.

May get a bit crowded during lunch time, but otherwise it‚Äôs generally empty. There are both indoor and outdoor seating.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105369529667135733795/reviews
