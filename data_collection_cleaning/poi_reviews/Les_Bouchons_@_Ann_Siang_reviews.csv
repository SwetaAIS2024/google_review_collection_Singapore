karize kieu,5,"Here for the first time and the food surpassed expectations ! We thoroughly enjoyed every dish - Lamb chops, creamed spinach and chocolate lava cake definitely stole the show. Service was meticulous and patient (didn’t chase us out or hurry us even tho they have closed for lunch break. Thanks for accommodating us, Gabriel!) . Highly recommend this place ! Will be back for more!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108228368331151838637/reviews
Daryl Tan,5,Date night out and decided to go French at Les Bouchons Ann Siang.  Australian Rib Eye was great done medium and at 300gms size.  Confit de Canard was surprisingly dry and small although averagely edible.  Soupe l'ognion was good.  Spinach as a side was good too.  Atmosphere is remarkably typical to a bistrot in France.  Would go back again but hope the duck confit will improve!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117964415942272145603/reviews
Shaf Jay,5,"Favourite place for a good steak and date night.
Steak was mild seasoned, perfect when dipped with the blue cheese dressing, the black pepper sauce is good too.

Fries are not soggy and lightly salted only.
Generous portion for the meat. Bone marrow goes superb with the sea salt and toast. Nothing to complain about this place.
Even the salad is crunchy, fresh and has a variety of ingredients in it. Staff are all friendly and service is top- tier. Keep up the amazing work!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105139884679043278446/reviews
cheriya,5,"Celebrated mother’s day here. Gabrielle was very welcoming and attentive - great recommendations from him. Had the onion soup, bone marrow, escargots, NZ ribeye & lamb chops. Highly recommend everything except for the escargots. Thanks for the lovely experience.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104096116814466481350/reviews
Gabriel FD,5,"Le Bouchon offers a great French dining experience with quality food and welcoming service.
•Starters: A strong selection of mustards, tapenade, and spreads. Served with fresh bread and real French butter.
•Main: The côte de boeuf was tender, well-cooked, and full of flavor. Fries were crisp and satisfying.
•Sides: Fresh greens and tomatoes brought good balance to the plate.
•Dessert: The crème brûlée had the right texture and a solid caramel crust.
•Team: The staff was friendly, helpful, and made the meal feel relaxed and personal.

A great place for steak lovers or anyone who enjoys real French bistro food. I’ll return.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117202909783781849731/reviews
