The fried fish and chicken teriyaki was a nice portion and the fish was nicely fried.\n\nThe oyaka don and the beef don also had a lot of rice but the amount if meat and egg could be improved.\n\nThe salmon and pork katsu bento was okay though the fish was smaller than expected.\n\nTastewise, most of the dishes were okay.",
