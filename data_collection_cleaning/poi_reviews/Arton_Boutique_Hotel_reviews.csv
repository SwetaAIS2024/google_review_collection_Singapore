e-huey Saw,1,"I booked the hotel a superior room via trip.com showing window for 2night. When I check in , I was told the room had no window unless I upgrade with additional fee. Further mentioned is stated in the T&C, hey without window and with window is totally different case and scenario. I don't mind room is extremely small. This is a scam. Totally not acceptable. Don't
ever book this hotel. Totally spoil my holiday.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112022639049328112316/reviews

A Bhatia,3,The hotel is located brilliantly. Closer to 2 MRT stations and walk to most of the amenities. The staff seemed to be a bit rude and does not engage enough especially night staff. The person we got next morning was very helpful. So a bit inconsistent. The Room was just enough and very minimalist. Enough to sleep but not big enough to even stand. To get on the bed there was a big step so might not be ideal for people with bad knees. The bathrooms and toilet facilities were adequate. The rooms do get cleaned everyday so we returned to clean rooms everyday.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112111961361581575773/reviews
Roger D. Duksi,4,"We stayed in the Deluxe King room. Despite the relatively small room, it was quite nice and cozy. The problem with the room is the walls are not soundproofed, making it quite noisy at night since sounds from the neighboring rooms and corridor were audible. Parents bringing kids might want to reconsider. The staff are friendly, and they clean the room every day. However, one of the night receptionists is a little rude and unhelpful. The location of the hotel is excellent, with two MRT stations (Lavender & Bendemeer) and a number of bus stops within walking distance. There are also plenty of food options around the hotel.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117787847756079415647/reviews
1V De80,5,"Typical boutique hotel in Singapore. Good location, close by to the MRT, food hawkers, cafes and a stroll to mustafa center.
