Paulina R.,5,"Asian Art Platform gives you a great overview of Chinese Modern and Contemporary Art. You get here a chance to experience unique art pieces of talented Chinese artists. These artists are chosen by Alice, who is a professional Art Advisor. I have been to several exhibitions, which Alice has organized. All of them were excellent and will stay in my memory forever. I can highly recommend you  to visit Asian Art Platform, which is located in one of the most beautiful corners of Singapore. Great Art, great Artists and last but not least great Art Advisor.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109251752252082475313/reviews

Wladimir Pallu de Beaupuy,5,"A very nice art gallery promoting creative artists, which is very refreshing and unlike most Singapore galleries displaying too often the same recurring artists.
Alice, the gallery owner is a real passionate and will put her pride explaining the artist history as well as their art's meaning.
With Asian Art platform you leave the place with more education than while entering the place.
Alice passion is contagious! Art is not a business but a meaning of life.
