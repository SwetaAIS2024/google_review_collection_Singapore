We got the Barbie/vanilla and the Cereal Milk and didn't eat either. Tasted very artificial and the texture was grainy. I expected far better from a cafe of a museum that's dedicated to ice cream. Unfortunately they didn't offer tasters but I can't imagine the other ice creams being much better. Shame but we won't be coming back, there's far better ice cream elsewhere in Dempsey.",
