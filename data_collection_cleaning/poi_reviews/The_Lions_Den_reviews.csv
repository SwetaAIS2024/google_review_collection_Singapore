Flo Yeow,1,"In full transparency, the team is okay. They served us well, and sold us what needed to be sold. We were here just for drinks anyways. Kudos to the ladies behind the counter.

It's a basic sports bar. There's nothing unique, nothing different, and nothing worth returning to. Maybe you'd be back for friends, but there's also a few uncles that come, get drunk, and fall onto tables with drinks and bottles breaking all over. For a spot along Club St, I'd expect better.

What properly ruined our night was how the manager (I'm guessing, since none of the crew came to persuade him to back off), came up to us at 2am, to tell us off on something petty. Sure, our friend was being cheeky, but instead of giving a verbal warning, the conversation escalated really quickly without the manager backing down, and we left so that a fight wouldn't end up happening. I'd honestly expect basic respect as human beings, and as paying patrons of the bar.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Joe,1,"Popped by here on a Sunday when almost everything else in the area was closed. The most disinterested, ‘I’m doing you a favour’ mentality from the solo employee who was more interested in smoking and talking to her friend outside than serving drinks. The real kicker was that the draft beer tasted absolutely foul, so if it’s a choice of this place or 7/11, I’d take cans of anchor in the street all day long",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102849232784603498823/reviews

Super Finds,1,"Experienced the same horrible experience with the manager/ owner Indian or Malay guy.  Super rude to tell off his customers when we were just happily playing pool that you cannot play doubles this and that. Then when we finished a game when the other party puts in the white ball while playing the black ball, he said no foul and the game should continue when we didn’t even asked for his comments. And I said the games over and he was super rude and shouted at me saying “house rules house rules! Read the house rules. You don’t know the rules don’t play!”  This man has so much anger and issues that he needs to seek out help for his own personal good.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106970588032200407801/reviews
Nguyen Hoang Minh Dang,5,The only place has tv for watching football in Chinatown. We are very difficult to find the place to watch MC vs MU. So they help us a lot. Thanks,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100376787823894906715/reviews
