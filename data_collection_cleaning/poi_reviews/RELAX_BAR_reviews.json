      "text": "Went in a group of 4 and seated at the patio tall table overlooking the park and sea. Thumbs up for the ambience but unfortunately the food and staff are a disappointment.\n\nWe ordered some skewers, asking for 2-pax portion. Thought of sharing so we can order more food variety. Ordered some wine and other drinks. Waiter came back later on to say the skewers seem not enough, urge that we order more. We didn't really probe as were busy in a conversation. Turned out the skewers were over ordered. Not a big deal though but felt kinda ripped off.\n\nOrdered oysters but no house white wine to go with. Fine, red wine will do but they ran out after 1 glass. Ordered fried squid, tough and over-fried.\n\nThere's an attached toilet in this place but it's very disgusting.\n\nOverall I didn't enjoy my visit. Probably it will appeal more to beer drinkers cause beer selection seems quite ok with promotions.",
