The lor mee gravy is thick and savoury which coat the noodles well. The balance of dishes  can be enhanced with their homemade chili sauce.\n\nAtmosphere: The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, making it a great spot for both family meals and casual dining.\n\nService: While the food is generally well-received, the staff can be inattentive, especially during busy times.",
