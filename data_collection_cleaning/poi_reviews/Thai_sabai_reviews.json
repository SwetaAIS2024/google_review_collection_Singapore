There was no promo for this stall but still decided to go for it because pad Thai craving.\n\nAnd pad Thai has thumbs up recommendation on the menu. Plenty of wok hei coming from the plate. It's small for hungry labour workers but office workers may find it acceptable. Prawn is small. Quality ok but don't expect big portion.",
