      "text": "Been coming to this KFC Kallang branch since a small kid decades ago so I am glad this place is still going strong. Service was good, the staff was really prompt helping to clear our tray just before I was about to clear it myself. Staff at the counter were doing their best tonight but for some reason not only did my order take very long to come, I also had to ask the staff to assist as it seemed my number was missed out; hence I ordered tonight 27/11/24 at 8.16pm but only could sit down with my order for only two people at 8.57pm, unfortunately my slowest experience here. The Tender Twister wrap quality was also a bit disappointing. But the fried chicken was on point as always üôèüèª",
