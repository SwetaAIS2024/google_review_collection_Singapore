潘銘峰,2,"I was so looking forward to dinner here last Sunday. We ordered 6 dishes. The fried rice was hard. The steamed fish was not hot in fact the gravy was lukewarm. The fried
yam ring had a milky taste to it. All in all, the dinner didn’t speak joy. I spent $97 for 2 pax. Disappointing meal. But what to do? Haha…",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112665031657494187523/reviews

Sim Jun Xun,5,"A cosy vegetarian restaurant in the heartland of Kovan/Serangoon. They undergone a revamp in recent months, I believe, and they have an updated menu with different food presentations. The staff are friendly in general and willing to be of kind service. Food comes at a reasonable cost given the location and upkeep of the place. Come and try if you are ever in the area, or just craving vegetarian food!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116359336950711248804/reviews
Pattern Won,5,"We celebrated our year-end dinner at Greenland Vegetarian, which offered a cozy ambiance. We ordered three dishes and their signature Fried Kway Teow, all of which were delicious and generously portioned, even in the small size.
