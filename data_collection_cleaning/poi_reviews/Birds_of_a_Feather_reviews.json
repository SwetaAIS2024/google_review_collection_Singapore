      "text": "First I want to highlight the exceptional service of the team at Birds of a Feather. I had a large group booking and they were proactive and communicative. Also had a last minute change and they were very understanding in accommodating our changes.\n\nReally enjoyed the food which was a creative fusion of flavours, familiar yet refreshing. Each dish was well executed. Personal favourites were the pork dumpling and the Chicken in the Chillies.\n\nAlso got the lunch sets which were good value for money, with large portions. Would highly recommend.",

The service was attentive and efficient, adding to the overall pleasant experience.\n\nHighly recommend this place for anyone looking for delicious food, a great atmosphere, and excellent service.

      "text": "Decided to try this place for mother‚Äôs day.\n\nThe dishes here, or at least the ones I‚Äôve ordered were a hit or miss for me. My favourite dish would be Crab & Avocado Brushetta ($18), nothing too heavy and I liked how they incorporate crab together with guac.\n\nYu Xiang Eggplant Soba ($18) was a tad bit salty for my liking. This was the only dish we didn‚Äôt finish ü´†\n\nFind the Chickens in the Chillies ($19) was pretty good üå∂Ô∏è The spices were fragrant and chicken pieces were fried to perfection. They used cashews, which I thought didn‚Äôt have that satisfying crisp compared to peanuts‚Ä¶\n\nTried out the Homestyle Braised Pork Belly ($63) everyone raved about. It was ok, nothing amazing. The table found it too greasy and overwhelmingly rich after a few spoons. The taste of truffle wasn‚Äôt very prominent in this dish. But you can taste lots and lots of kale üòÇ\n\nYammy duck ($28) was my least favourite. This dish is probably an acquired taste, you‚Äôll appreciate this if you like foie gras. I thought the yam didn‚Äôt go very well with the duck confit. In terms of texture, the yam was very slimy, and the duck confit wasn‚Äôt crispy enough. I‚Äôd skip this dish 100%.\n\nGot a osmanthus cocktail ($26) too. Overall service was good. Servers were all very helpful when recommending dishes, taking pictures, and explaining the different components of the dish. Ambience was good too, though I didn‚Äôt really like seating as there were no lights above us which made our surroundings pretty dark.\n\nOverall: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è/5",
