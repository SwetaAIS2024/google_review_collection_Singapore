Ann Meow,4,"The peanut butter filling impressed me - i could taste normal butter (or margarine) sugar as well as peanutsss. However it's overall pretty oily and wet (from melted butter i presume).

Bought taro and signature coconut for my family too, total $4.80. Family said the coconut was nice, but taro was too sweet.

Maybe I'm used to QQ kueh texture of Munchi Pancakes so i found this kueh less chewy!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103882782519150276010/reviews

Lau Yu Qin,4,Tried the matcha and chocolate banana flavors. The pancake flavors were definitely unique but slices were much smaller than what you get from elsewhere. Matcha was decent but the chocolate banana was a bit too sweet for me.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106265098661639103255/reviews
