Andy Heng,5,Very good service and great place for a coffee break at Puteri Harbour. Excellent place for a morning walk and they have good warm breakfast set here to relax after a walk. It's great to see this Starbucks is always clean with good service here at Puteri Harbour.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110817130770368002900/reviews
Lonely Railway Explorer,2,"I'm curious how they get higher than 3 star.

Noisy environment, outdoor dining area dirty, crow keep barking.

WiFi coverage poor.

And the priority I concern is the coffee, what can I say the worst coffee I taste in Johor area.

Served inefficiently, Q 10 minutes just 1 customer in front of me, and waiting another 15 minutes for my coffee just because they forgotten my order.

Showy Starbucks outlet, truly disappointed.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111567949754713360928/reviews
