Kelli Poh,5,"My little one was enrolled in 2021 and we have since seen several changes in the management and staff. Nonetheless, amidst the challenging situation, the staff continued to dedicate themselves to teaching and guiding the little ones along. It has been great consolation to us as parents when we know that they are in good hands. The teachers were also professional and responsive in updating the progress of the little ones and not just lip service.  Kudos üëè to all of u.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117030554130736020540/reviews
Swee Chin,5,"My girl has enrolled with sunflower since 2023 and my experience has been pleasant so far with centre manager and teachers.
Whenever i asked my kid do you like Teacher michelle, teacher efa and ÁéãËÄÅÂ∏à, she will always say ‚Äúyes!‚Äù. Kid does not lie so that explain a lot about the effort and dedication put in by the teachers.
I noticed there were a few negative 1 star reviews but they are actually 2 years and older post or referring to some unhappy incident in 2020. It seen to me the school has come a long way and put in the effort to improve the overall standards so I highly recommend any parents who are thinking to send their kid to sunflower.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103181147494889307011/reviews

D X,5,"I'm not sure why the reviews are so negative, but personally, I like the school and the teachers. While they may seem firm and stern, their love for the kids is genuine. You can see it in the way they pay attention to small details.

My daughter has had severe separation anxiety even after 6 months, but whenever I peek into the school, I always see a teacher carrying her or comforting her.

What I really appreciate about the school is its culture. They encourage older students to interact with the younger ones, and you can see the older students showing affection to the younger ones.

I want to sincerely thank Teacher Michelle Wang Lao Shi, Teacher Efa, Teacher Cynthia, and especially Rong Rong Lao Shi, who has since ended her contract.

To anyone reading the negative comments, I suggest going for a school tour and observing for yourself. It's not as bad as some comments make it seem.
Highly recommend school",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105778457018809876589/reviews
