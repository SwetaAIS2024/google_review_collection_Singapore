      "text": "My GP referred me to Dr Wong on 4-Jan. I called Dr Wong’s clinic on 6-Jan morning and was lucky to get a first consult on same day morning. Within the same week we completed my endoscopy and colonoscopy. I have high anxiety when it comes to doctors appointments regardless of specialty. Dr Wong is the first doctor of such seniority who managed to ease my anxiety from Day 1 until the day I was discharged. During the entire 2-week journey with Dr Wong, I always felt that I am in good hands, he knows what he’s doing, he is confident while at the same time speak to me in layman terms that I can connect with as a human who knows nothing about endoscopy and colonoscopy. In 2 weeks I managed to gain assurance about my stomach/intestine health and the appropriate nutritional needs. Thank you Dr Wong!",
