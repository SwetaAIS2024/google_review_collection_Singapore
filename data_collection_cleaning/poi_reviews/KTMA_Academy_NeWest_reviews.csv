Rofeirhanz Ghazali,5,"KTMA is such an amazing Taekwondo school! The instructors are friendly, skilled, and really care about helping everyone improve. The classes are fun, challenging, and a great way to stay fit while learning valuable skills.

What I love most is how they focus on building confidence and discipline, not just the physical side of Taekwondo. Whether you’re a beginner or have experience, you’ll feel right at home here. Highly recommend KTMA to anyone thinking about joining!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116824938560351411102/reviews
