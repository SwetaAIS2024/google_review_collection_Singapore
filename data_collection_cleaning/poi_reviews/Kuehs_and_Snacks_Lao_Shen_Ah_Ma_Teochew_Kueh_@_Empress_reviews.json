My favourite is the Jiucai kueh (Èü≠ËèúÁ≤øÔºâÔºå various kinds of Ang ku kueh, Èº†Â£≥Á≤øÔºåreal bamboo shoot kueh (Á¨ãÁ≤ø), mang Kuang kueh (turnips kueh).  There is another stall called Poh Chieu nearby which is more commercialised with translucent & thinner dough.  However, the old uncle at Lao Sim Ah Mah Kueh has been selling these kueh‚Äôs for decades and it gives a home coming feeling as he speaks Teochew to his customers. üíï",

Bought 4 flavours of ang ku kueh (bean, peanut, sesame, yam) and how is it that all of them- skin too thick, feels like it was kept for a few days already, and the filling were all bland and lacklustre. Bean, yam and sesame all roughly tasted the same. And the peanut tasted ÊºèÈ£é. $1.30/piece\n\nBought the mini ku chai kueh too, again the skin was so thick that we felt that we ate more skin than filling. ÔºÑ6.50 for 6 mini pieces.",
