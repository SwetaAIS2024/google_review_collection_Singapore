Super Fragrance,4,"Ordered red tea longan for $2.20. Their dessert priced around $1.80 to $2.80

Pro
Red tea jelly taste. One of the better tasting red tea jelly.

Longan. Well is longan can't get wrong with that.

Meh
Slightly on the too sweet side especially when not stirred well.

Ice not that well shaved. Not very snowy with bigger solid ice.

Cons
Red tea jelly not easy to cut. Should cut the jelly onto smaller pieces before serving.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
