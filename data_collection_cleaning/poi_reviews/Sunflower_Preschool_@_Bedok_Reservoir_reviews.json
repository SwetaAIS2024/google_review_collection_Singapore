Bullying was not properly managed, leading to high profile child abuse complaints.\n\nConcerns by affected parents were not taken seriously, leaving many no choice but to seek redress from ECDA.\n\nTVs and screen time were commonplace until ECDA stepped in following the complaints.\n\nIt is such a pity as some teachers were really passionate, the school charged reasonable fees and is in a convenient location with sheltered access to the bus stop.\n\nHaving said that, these happened over a year ago, and a lot of positive changes should have been made by now.",
