Reason for choosing them because they gave the highest quote for my vehicle ($250).\n\nOn “scrap day” when I reached the place, the first thing I felt was the friendliness of their personnel.\n\nMy next surprise was the FREE ride to nearest MRT station! I wasn’t told of this service before hand and I was already planning how to get back to the east from this “bird no lay egg place” :). Kudos to the company.",

      "text": "I selected this company to scrap my car mostly because the staff (a certain Ms Sim) who took my enquiry was efficient, clear with her explanation of the LTA car deregistration process and responsive to my clarifications.  Although her boss was too uncompromising with the scrap value of the car (as compared to higher offers from other sources), I decided to select KKA coz Ms Sim gave me confidence the transaction and deregistration process AND payments would likely be properly done and smooth. On the day of the execution of the task, there were regrettably some slight issues but they were quickly resolved by Ms Sim. Overall, I would say it’s a company you can do your deals with.",
