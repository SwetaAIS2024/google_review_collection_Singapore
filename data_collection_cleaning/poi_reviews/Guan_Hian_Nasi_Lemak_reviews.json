      "text": "I prefer this nasi lemak near bedok.\n\nA nasi lemak  need to consist a protein, an egg, fragrance pandan rice and 2 key components. ( The chilli sauce and ikan bills with peanuts\n\nThe lose a star due to the dry rice and lack of pandan favour in the rice.\n\nThe sambal chilli  and ikan bills are the  keys that made the customers keep coming back to order.\n\nThe chilli is not only spicy , but also sweet. I read previous review that the chilli sambal was bought  from supermarket  shelf. I checked with the owner and my own taste bud. I can confirmed the sambal chilli is their own made sambal.\n\nIkan bills  is just nice and they have a slight touch of spicy to keep the people wanting to have more.",
