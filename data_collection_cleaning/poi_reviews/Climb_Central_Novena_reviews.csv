Cheok Olivia,5,"Chill place to climb. Suitable for beginners and experienced climbers alike. They have auto belay lanes for solo climbers. Staff here are friendly but also take safety seriously and will make rounds to ensure that adults are properly supervising their young children.
The climb routes will be refreshed every month or so (in sections).",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102626143264279184348/reviews
Mark Tho,4,"Very nice! Such a fun day with the family trying rock climbing for the first time.

The staff there are very experienced and provide a good safety briefing with practice sessions to make sure you do it safely.

Can get quite crowded later in the day.

Prices are full day pass so you can come in and out. But they may stop entry if they are full house.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108336947993231942478/reviews
cse1217,5,"Climb Central Novena is a very centralised location for rock climbing.

It has 2 levels for climbing. There's also bouldering walls available. The one on the 2nd level is for shorter course.

There's many lockers for you to put your belongings. There are also a bench near the counter for you to sit and take off your shoes.

They also have warming up area for you to stretch and do pull up and hang.

It's also well ventilated with big fans and aircon. It's clean and well maintained. Staff are friendly and helpful when we ask them to assist us in taking photos and also when we misplace certain items.

At the closing time, the staff did not rush us to leave and just waited patiently for us to finish packing and greet us politely when we left.

Marlen Chua,3,"Our experience at Climb Central could have been more pleasant if the staff were patient. It was our second visit, though the first was a long time ago. Unfortunately, Timothy seemed annoyed and upset when we struggled to understand his instructions. This made the session less enjoyable. On a positive note, the other staff members were kind and accommodating.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101939117443368633717/reviews
Chua Hsieh Li,3,"Service is slightly lacking and the routes are limited, especially for bouldering. In general, compared to other gyms, they have a more limited range of difficulty levels, for example I could only do a few problems, with the rest being too easy or too hard",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103664052781486758526/reviews
