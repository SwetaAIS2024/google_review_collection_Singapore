Charan Shetty,1,"I visited this place shortly after it opened, and my experience may reflect the teething issues of a new establishment. Unfortunately, the service was quite inattentive, which impacted the overall dining experience.

The food definitely needs significant improvement. I ordered apple juice, Coke, a chicken tikka roll, and chicken shawarma. Sadly, the only item I genuinely enjoyed was the Coke â€” the rest of the food was disappointing in both taste and quality.

On a positive note, the ambiance is a standout feature. The upper deck offers a nice view overlooking the Changi runway, which aviation enthusiasts might appreciate. However, due to its proximity to the runway, the noise levels can get quite high, making it less ideal for quiet or intimate conversations.

With improvements in service and food quality, this place has potential, especially given its unique location.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113767456523035624781/reviews
