Gg Ggmygg,5,"Very surprised for the grade of food here, it's restaurant standard. We have our CNY dinner here and the food was huge portioned and tasty. The best is there lobster platter, lobster are fresh with fruits salad, besides that, they put in a lot of effort for creating the sides like fried scallops, chicken wrap sea cucumber with asparagus, jelly fish and egg salad, definitely a must try and recommended presentable dish! Will definitely patron here again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117189767098998723410/reviews
Jocelyn Huang,2,"Today we ordered a dish of sweet and sour pork for takeaway. It lacks of tomato/sour flavour. Pork was fried once only, it’s soggy. And it has a strong “frozen” pork smell. Hope this is only one time off.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114690104264535015114/reviews
Jacob TAN,4,"This zhi char stall is located in a modern coffeeshop. It is airy with good ventilation. Today, we came over to do a simple testing. We ordered the fried sin chew bee hoon ( basic dish) and the salted egg yolk pork ribs.
The bee hoon has some wok hei and tasted ok but it was too oily and there was not much ingredients.
The pork chop was tender and the salted egg yolk added amazing flavour to this dish. This is one of the better salted egg yolk dish that I have eaten.
Service is fast but the lady taking order only speaks mandarin.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
Simply Chua,1,DO NOT BUY OR REGRET. Look at this $12 for this sweet sour pork. Its not fully cooked. First look it doesn't have the crispy exterior. Just taste poorly of flour and disgusting frozen many days meat. Fishy taste. Worst ever eaten in my life.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104067931466707899133/reviews
Kevin Ng,5,"Very well priced and food is amazing. As a resident in the Area I'm super, super glad that this Zichar opened near my estate!

The wait can be quite long, so please be prepared or visit during non peak hours.... trust me, it's worth it!

Highly recommend their range of individual rice/noodle dishes. E.g Dry beef horfun, 奶黄排骨饭.. etc. VERY well priced - my go to place especially when everything is so pricey now!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116845354307506613905/reviews
