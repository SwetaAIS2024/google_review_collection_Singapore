      "text": "This school have no self control over their student whatsoever and even have poor education system, as their student cause a havoc even outside of  school ground. There was a Groups of students from this school in the bus i took they are all hoarding the seats by placing their bags in the empty seat and despite seeing a lot of people trying to find seat they don’t bother moving their bags. Not only that, they were all acting like a bunch of monkeys and making so much noises as well as eating candies in the bus even though there a rule that say no eating in the bus. From this case I can tell that this school have poor education system for the students as they don’t even know simple manner. Why are primary school kids even allowed to run out of the school without adult supervision?",
