Killer_Jaguar_99 Golden Jaguar,3,"My mom bought 3 food & sardine fried rice for me & requested for no vegetable. My mom paid for the food after ordering. When the food came, there was vegetable on my food but I don't give a shit & just eat it. My mom ask the server the prices of each food & said mine was $7. She asked as the total bill didn't add up. Server came back & said my food was $8 üíÄ My bro food was Maggie combo for $9. I gave the shop a 3 star as the guy didn't know the prices of the food & food was overpriced. Food was delicious tho. My food at max should be $6 but maybe it was $8 because of location? But it cannot be because of the location, extra dollar for combo??",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118027901821525460334/reviews

2nd visit.
They recommended a combo meal : fried beehoon, an egg sunny side up, cheesey fries and mutton meat pieces.
Priced at $9.
Again only the beehoon stands out !

First time ordering at this stall.

Ordered fried beehoon n I‚Äôm quite surprised they offered the white beehoon, the way Chinese would fry it, without frying it with ketchup. Priced at $5.50.

I was served at my seated table and he willingly complied with our request for another set of cutlery.

It is absolutely delicious! But really peppery üå∂Ô∏è hot. So you might want to ask for less spicy.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116788322544213433170/reviews
