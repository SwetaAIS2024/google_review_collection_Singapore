Doris,5,"I went for my dental appt today & was treated by Dr Johari. It was a very pleasant & excellent experience throughout  the entire treatment though I had
a soreness on my gum.  The counter staff is polite, caring & helpful too.  I would recommend this clinic if you want a good dental  experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100769054360826147522/reviews
Dione Tan,2,Did tooth filling with Dr Johari but the filling fell out the next day. Had it patched back at Denticare again but unfortunately it also fell out the second time plus the hole became bigger from his works. If a tooth filling does not work in my case I should have been informed because I now have a bigger tooth chip with gum sensitivity when chewing. Also paid for the service to fail on me twice.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109812689037951292506/reviews
Min-Wei Lee,5,"Fast, professional and affordable! I managed to get an appointment quickly via the hotline and was seen by Dr. Johari. He was friendly and professional, and clear in his explanation of my dental issues. I also appreciated how transparent they were about costs upfront. Completed a consultation, x-ray, and routine cleaning within 40 mins.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116535612116864868466/reviews
pravitha rajandra,1,"I had a truly disappointing experience at Denticare - Marine Parade. The nurse/receptionist who has a fuller figure, my family interacted with was incredibly rude and unprofessional. From the moment we arrived, we were met with a dismissive attitude and a complete lack of basic courtesy. When we attempted to ask questions, we were treated with impatience and condescension, which made me feel disrespected throughout the visit.

What was even more troubling was when my mom provided her NRIC during registration. After handing back the ID, the nurse purposely cleaned her hands with rubbing alcohol in a manner that made me question whether it was meant as an unnecessary action or, more concerningly, if it was done because of our ethnicity. This behavior was uncomfortable and unsettling.

In a healthcare setting, I expect professionalism, respect, and dignity, all of which were completely lacking during this experience. I sincerely hope that the management at Denticare addresses this matter to ensure no other patient feels mistreated. Better service and respect should be the standard, not the exception.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112742474291563539370/reviews
Theresa Liu,5,"Dr Johari is a very patient and gentle dentist with such light fingers that have removed all my fears on dental visits. Each treatment was painless and most comfortable due to Dr Johari's judgement was spot on. Staff Doris was extremely intuitive when she noticed that I was sweating while waiting, she turned on the mini fan to cool me down. Upon settling the bill, she ensured that my payment amount is linked to my NTUC app to obtain the reward points. Thank you very much for the fantastic service!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103490297232528360876/reviews
