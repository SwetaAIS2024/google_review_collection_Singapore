      "text": "A quaint little ice cream shop nestled in the humble corners of Telok Blangah.\n\nAtmosphere was nice and quiet as we visited on a Saturday afternoon, the neon lights were a great complement to the vibe, gives kind of like an American diner feel to the place!\n\nWith GST & Service Charge, a Waffle with 3 Ice Cream flavours set us back ~$16.\n\nFirstly, the waffle was great. Crispy on the outside with airy, fluffy texture on the inside, delectable üòã\n\nWe ordered three flavours: Yoghurt Oreo, Milo Mallow and Hazelnut Truffle.\n\nYoghurt Oreo had kind of a sour, cheesecakey feel to it with chunks of crushed oreo. Was rather balanced but not my cup of tea! Definitely worth a try though.\n\nThe Milo Mallow was awesome! Sweet chocolate ice cream paired with soft marshmallow chunks somehow works so well I don‚Äôt know why more places don‚Äôt have the flavour. Seriously great!\n\nHazelnut Truffle was really nice too but definitely on the sweeter side. If I were to describe it I suppose it would be ice cream ferraro rochet. I believe that encapsulates the entire essence of the flavour.\n\nOverall, the waffles and ice cream portions and flavour were good at the price point, with a nice atmosphere it‚Äôs surely somewhere you‚Äôd want to visit if you ever find yourself in the area! Will come back again!!!",
