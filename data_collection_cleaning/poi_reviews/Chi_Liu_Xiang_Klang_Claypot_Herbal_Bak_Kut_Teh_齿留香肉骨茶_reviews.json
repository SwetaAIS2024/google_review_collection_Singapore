      "text": "I gave 1 star food due to the 5 star friendly service from the china lady manning the stall. She‚Äôs friendly and kind enough to bring me the food.\n\nBut back to the brutal honest feedbacks.\nNow I double and triple confirmed what the earlier one star reviews to this stall is true and honest.\n\n1. Over priced with the $2 Tao Kee Skins. Maybe a good 5-8 pieces and $2 Whammy!!!\n\n2. Ordered their pork offals mixed soup. Scraps only scraps, I from pork livers to lean pork pieces, none came in a decent cut sized. At the $7.80 or something, it‚Äôs hugely overpriced than the famous Áå™ÊùÇÊ±§ down at downtown area.\n\nThis is a neighbourhood coffeeshop and stalls, your pricing is as good as a town area food prices.\n\nThanks for the first try and last",

I like the self take garlic added with chilie padi and soya sauce, it goes well with my rice I can eat just that.\n\nStaff friendly and informed can ask for more soup if I want.",

The pork intestines were well-cooked, and the pig's organ soup, while filled with ingredients, lacked a bit of oomph in the flavor department.  The add-ons of enoki mushrooms and rice complemented the meal.  The total cost came to $30.80.",
