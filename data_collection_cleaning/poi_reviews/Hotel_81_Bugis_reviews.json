      "text": "A truly comforting experience at Hotel 81 Bugis\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Singapore, I highly recommend staying at Hotel 81 Bugis. The location is great, but what truly sets it apart is the warm hospitality and incredible staff.\n\nI had an unexpected situation on the very first night when my 12-year-old child came down with a high fever around 2 AM. In a bit of a panic, I called the reception to ask for help locating a nearby hospital. That’s when Valarie, who was on duty, went above and beyond.\n\nShe not only provided all the necessary details but also promptly arranged a cab for us. By the time I came downstairs with my child, the cab had already arrived. Her quick thinking and calm demeanor were a huge relief during a stressful moment.\n\nValarie, thank you so much for your compassion, professionalism, and support. Your help meant the world to us, and it truly reflects the kind of service travelers hope for but rarely experience.\n\nA big thank you to the Hotel 81 Bugis team—and especially to Valarie—for making our stay memorable, even in the most challenging moment.",

The smell was strong and the ventilation fan was broken. The a/c helped a bit. That was our biggest complaint. The price isn't bad for a Singapore hotel, they just need to fix the mold problem.",

But the staff at the front desk was really helpful and gave us an upgrade. This room had a window to the backside, but you cannot open it. (Unless you have a little square key and thankfully, one of the previous guests had unlocked it.) The bed itself was ok. The bathroom was tiny again, only one person at a time.",
