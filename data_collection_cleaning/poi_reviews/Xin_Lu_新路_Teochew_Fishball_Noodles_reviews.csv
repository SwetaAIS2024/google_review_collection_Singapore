Jason Ong,4,"Located in the Bendemeer hawker centre, the sign claims they were from Margaret Drive. The serving size is generous for $4.50. The chilli and vinegar paired very well and really elevated my mee pok to another level. Suffice to say, it was shiok! The fishballs were large and bouncy. Worth checking out if you're in the area.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews
