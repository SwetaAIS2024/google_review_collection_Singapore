Hazel Nut,1,"Chance upon this coffee shop on a Sunday afternoon as there wasnâ€™t much options nearby. Surprised that only one stall was opened which was the bar Chor mee. Had to settle for this stall, as there was no other choices. The coffee shop was quite badly maintained, bar Chor mee was below average and priced at a higher end considering this is a coffee shop.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115549414853802753594/reviews
