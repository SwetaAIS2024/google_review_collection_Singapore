I found that the coffee maker had a nice smile and wore an apron. He explained the difference between coffee and coffee c very politely. The point is that the coffee he brewed was rich and the amount was well controlled. I felt that I was passionate about this shop again. Hope owner will not change this coffee maker üôèüèª",

The staff could be more friendly and smile more but other than that I‚Äôd rate this place 4/5. A good alternative to the Cafes nearby, I quite like that it is hidden also. I sometimes have meetings here too.",
