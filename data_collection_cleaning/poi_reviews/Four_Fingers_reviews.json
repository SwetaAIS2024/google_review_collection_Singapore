      "text": "Ordered a 6 piece fried chicken meals at 7am. The chicken is Korean style, so there is some sour mixed with the fried chicken. And it might look a bit darker than usual.\nThe chicken is small and a bit dry out in the middle. Sweet and spicy. You can taste the soy sauce and honey.\nHonestly not the best fired chicken for the price. If Burger King had beef burger in breakfast menu, I’d get a burger instead. Sadly not so much options in the morning.",

Food was delicious and quite cheap but meal size is not big. Old lady behind the desk was very friendly and lovely. I suggest everyone to try if you are looking this kind of food.",
