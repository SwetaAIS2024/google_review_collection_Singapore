It still needs a lot of improvement, fine tuning to be better than prata master next door. A little too doughy for my liking and is unable to retain and maintian its temperature despite order to make fresh. Kwa curry is good though, it should go well with chapati too, i see the other tables were all eating thosai, prolly something to try when one visits. Good ambience, doesnt feel like a prata place.",

      "text": "Ever since I discovered Prata Alley at Alexandra Central, I've been coming her a fair number of times (I work nearby). Thosai had never disappointed me (especially ghee thosai omg). Briyani was incredible. Prata was crispy as requested. I almost ordered a third piece but too full. Mutton curry was good. Mutton pieces tender and flavourful. The only thing I didn't enjoy was mutton soup because the pieces got stuck in my teeth but that's not their fault. I just don't have enough teeth so I couldn't chew properly.\n\nThe best thing is, no matter how busy or quiet it is, owner/manager is always thoughtful and patient. It's so wholesome to witness little interactions between him and the children that come with their parents. This is a nice place. Please don't ever change.\n\nPictures taken on different days. I have other pictures but too lazy to scroll.",

They can also cook prata with olive oil for a healthier option for additional $0.50.\nPrices are very reasonable for the quality of food.\nMy ultimate cheat day meal ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹",

      "text": "Ordered the chicken briyani, it was great. However, the portion was rather large, I recommend sharing a serving between 2 people. Unless you have a huge appetite.\n\nI think their service is hands down the best I've had, one that can be given 5 stars with full confidence. Unlike the Master Prata nearby, the staff here are extremely attentive and polite.\n\nThe majority of people that find the food here not to their taste probably have a preference for heavier and stronger tastes. Personally I find it just nice.\n\nThe shop is very clean with no overly loud music or stains on the table/utensils/plates. It was a great experience, I'll be visiting again.",
