David Moh,5,"This is a mid size shopping mall with a wide variety of shops selling a good variety of food, wares and services.

A typical neighborhood mall but I particularly like the cosy space where there are chairs and tables for shoppers to rest their tired feet, or to just chill for free. I hope it is not a temporary setup.

A bustling place with a good mix of shops. Recommended to visit if you are in the neighborhood.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112451213464084221858/reviews
