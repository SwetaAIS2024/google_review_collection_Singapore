The iced latte was pretty deep and tasty.\nPlace wasn't crowded and a lot of people seemed to be ordering to go or ordering online.\nStaff were friendly and service was good. We just sat inside and chilled for a bit cause the westher outside was so hot",

It accommodates around 3 pax per table.\n\nCoffee is average at best. Banana muffin was excellent because it was heated up before serving. Sausage puff was average.",
