Crystal Ang,5,"An active and friendly group of gardeners put in a lot of effort to grow many kinds of vegetables in this community garden. In weekends you can see them gather in the resting area of the garden and you can get to know them better and ask for permission to enter and take a tour around. As a budding gardener, this garden is very inspiring! They have previously grown large pumpkins suspended vertically too! Thereâ€™s also hydroponically grown vegetables inside! Beautiful and memorable garden!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102706177551417725845/reviews
