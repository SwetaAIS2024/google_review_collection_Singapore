Klara Suherman,2,"The staff and doctors are friendly and helpful but the clinic at Fusionopolis smells damp / moldy! Not sure how healthy this place is and most of the time we have to wait for sometime before our turn! Really unhealthy and looks unhygienic

The fact that it is located in a nice Tech park building, the clinic looks very shabby",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107616153322966072117/reviews
Alvin ang xun jie,2,Recep was nice. But doctor didn't let me describe my conditions fully. Interrupted my train of thoughts and just ended without being able to fully explain all the symptoms. Being sick definitely did not put me in best condition to think. Hope doctor can give patients more time in future to elaborate more without cutting off the conversation. Probably hitting lunch time was a bad idea to go down.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106496481107391999006/reviews
Xin Xiu Tan,5,"Front desk ladies are very helpful & doctors are quite professional.

They dont just give basic lozenges & paracetamol for flu, in fact they really looked into it & gave really useful prescriptions.
My go-to whenever I am feeling unwell.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114398716855269220948/reviews
Ang YC,1,"Closed 30 mins before and never bother to put up sign - the medical service nowadays is really poor especially when you have patient that's sick and just ask you to go away.

I wont bother to even come here if not because there's no other options around. Would also spread the words to all my colleagues in Galaxis.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115466587073835955168/reviews
Vina Schneider,5,"Went to the clinic for my domestic helper's medical check-up. Siti at the reception immediately presented herself as polite & professional. By the end of the visit I found her calming, emphatic, considerate & knowledgeable. Doctor Loo Y T too was personable with my helper. Would book future check-ups with this clinic, highly recommend anyone.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113830640196978053501/reviews
