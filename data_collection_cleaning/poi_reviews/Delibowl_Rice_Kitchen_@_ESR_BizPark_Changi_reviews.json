The Stewed Beef Brisket with Tomato Set Meal ($15.15) was a standout: tender beef, perfectly cooked potatoes, and a refreshing cucumber side. It’s like a Filipino caldereta without the extras but just as delicious.\n\nI also loved the Fried Potato, Eggplant, and Long Bean ($7.70)—a well-seasoned, hearty dish where the veggies were cooked to perfection.\n\nPrices are fair, portions are generous, and the food is surprisingly good for such a quiet spot. Just remember it’s self-service—clean as you go! Definitely worth a visit.",

Not to forget they provided free soup to go along as well.\n\nWill definitely be a regular here thank you Delibowl!!!",

The soup had plenty of vegetables and garnishes to provide a refreshing crunch to complement the slices of fish steeped in the sour soup base.\n\nThe soup is a tad on the spicy side but I presume this is the standard for this restaurant with a stable of mala spicy dishes.\n\nThe ordering was smooth via the table-specific QR codes. The service was also very quick.  Hallmarks of efficient management.",
