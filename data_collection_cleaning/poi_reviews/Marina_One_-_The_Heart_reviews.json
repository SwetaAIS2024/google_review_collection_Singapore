We went around for like a whole hour not being able to locate where this place was even though we‚Äôre standing exactly at the point that Maps told us we arrived. Really a frustrating and disappointing experience that also let down everything after that for us. It‚Äôs basically a residential building so nothing much to see. A couple of trees and displays at best. A little crowded since this place is now popular with tourists so you might have to wait for your turn to take photos.",

In vertebrates there may be up to four chambers (as in humans), with two atria and two ventricles.‚Äù. others may say that it is ‚Äúthe central or innermost part of something.‚Äú. but i found my true definition of the heart. that is this place. this place is truly magical. a quiet and peaceful spot tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city. the only bad thing about the place is that i could not reach the water tubes tho. a solid 9/10 üòçü§§üò´",
