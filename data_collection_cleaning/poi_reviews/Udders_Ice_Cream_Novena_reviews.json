You have diverse flavor with the typical strawberry , vanilla, speculous, cookies and cream to the alcohol type which is rum and raisin , Baileyâ€™s .\n\nWhat blew us off was the muah Chee flavor , similar and showcasing the local snack of peanut and mochi .\n\nThe Mao shan wang is wonderful according to the hubs but what was surprising was as the price for 2 scoops  $ 9.40 and you need to top up $5.80 for emperor Mao per scoop hence  for 2 scoops of king of fruit was a whopping $ 22 bucks .\n\nWhat was eye catching was their water mountain , quite the artistic sculpture !",
