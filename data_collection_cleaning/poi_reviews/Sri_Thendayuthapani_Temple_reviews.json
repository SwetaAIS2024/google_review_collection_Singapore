      "text": "I went to this temple on 11 Feb 2025 to participate in the Thaipusam festival. However, the way the Hindu Endowment Board and temple management had planned many stops causing unnecessary delays along the way and to add there was a crowding (see photos) at the last stretch leading to temple. Hence, under the blazing sun with no natural shelter normally provided by the trees (the trees were cut the week before) many devotees suffered dizzy spells, fainting and some required first aid and ambulance assistance. The crowding was seen at the last stretch before the temple, however, the first aid post was set up far away beyond the temple entrance - poor planning. Lets hope they put in a bit more effort to think carefully to plan properly and do a good job in future.",

Built in 1859, it is dedicated to Lord Murugan and is a significant site during the annual Thaipusam festival, where devotees carry kavadis in a show of devotion. The temple's intricate architecture, featuring beautifully carved pillars and a richly decorated gopuram, reflects the Dravidian style. Inside, the serene atmosphere invites quiet reflection and worship. The temple is a must-visit for those interested in Singaporeâ€™s cultural heritage, offering a glimpse into the city's vibrant Indian community and spiritual traditions.",
