Heng Alicia,4,"Casual seafood dining experience with warm hospitality. The crabs were fresh and good.We ordered the shimmering and chilli crabs. Felt that the chilli crab sauce could be less sweet. One of the personal favourites was the home made prawn roll, it was awesome and i think it is a must order. Other dishes were pretty good too. Will return to order the crab beehoon!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105067222555600172949/reviews
WL WL,5,"Awesome dining experience! The creativity in their food and decor shines through. We brought our parents, and everyone loved it! Standout dishes include their crab noodle.  The previous time we came we have tried their salted egg, and chilli crabs, all yummy. (their crabs are huge!). The service was top-notch, too - they even accommodated my dad's mobility needs. Highly recommend!
Recommended to reserve your seat first as they always have crowds.  Some dishes at the higher price but overall a good dining experience.  Enjoy.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106188708574227759059/reviews
Ron Ang,5,"Our family went there for Mother's Day Dinner and we had an incredible seafood experience at Kelly Jie Seafood restaurant.

From the moment the dishes arrived, the presentation was great, and clearly crafted with care. The prawns were juicy and full of flavor, perfectly charred with a hint of smokiness.  What really stood out was the freshness of the seafoodâ€”everything tasted like it was just caught that morning.

The staff were friendly and receptive. Service was attentive, and the ambiance added to the overall enjoyment.

Highly recommend for any seafood lover looking for quality and flavor.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112845014256411326525/reviews
Bill Repko,5,"I tied a few other popular chili crab locations around Singapore and this one stood out as my favorite.

Highly recommend the chili crab or black pepper crab. We ordered both an although they are different itâ€™s difficult to say which was better. Both are excellent.

Recommend you go early for dinner or make a reservation. We went early and had no trouble getting a table right away. By the end of our meal the place was packed.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104920308170335814908/reviews
