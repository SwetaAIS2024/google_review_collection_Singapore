Huiping Chong,5,"We were referred to Dr. Melanie Tan by my mum’s renal doctor, Dr. Ng, and had a fantastic experience. The receptionist was welcoming and made us feel reassured from the moment we arrived. The nurse was also very friendly and showed great understanding of my mum's condition. Dr. Tan kindly accommodated us for a last-minute consultation, and we never felt rushed. She took the time to explain everything clearly, and we finally understood why my mum was experiencing her condition.
