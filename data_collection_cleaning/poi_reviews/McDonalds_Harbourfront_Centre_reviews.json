One of the staff told me that their machine can only produce 1-2 coffees at a time so the waiting time will be long. I can tell that the staff are all stressed from the overwhelming orders too.\n\nOrdered myself a fillet o fish and waited for almost 20mins. i guess the staff that was handling my burger really gave up as seen in the photo.",

Mala isn‚Äôt as spicy though. Potato pops are so-so only.\n\nCurry McNuggets are quite underwhelming. Curry flavour is really light.\n\n1 star as this outlet isn‚Äôt able to cope with promotional period overload ($1 coffee).",

I've ordered through the automatic machine, but I don't know what the next step is. Then I asked her.  But she was just stared, didn't say anything and then she walked away left me like I'm an idiot. She's maybe a kitchen staff, but if she doesn't understand what I was asking about, it's better if she tells me to ask other staff, not just walk away.  How rude!!!",

The combination of onions and cucumber is great but lacking taste of the peanut sauce, so a bit disappointing!",

Countless of times we have placed orders and 8/10 times they will miss out the maple syrup for the breakfast pancakes and we have to deal with dry pancakes for breakfast or they will miss out something in the order. Really don‚Äôt know what to say but to not order delivery from here. Not sure if they want us to choke on the dry pancakes. We had to buy our own honey to standby instead üòµ‚Äçüí´",
