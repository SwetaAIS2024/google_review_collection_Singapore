      "text": "Decent kopitiam. Fast service wven though it was quite crowded this morning at 730am. Don't really know what the hype is all about. The Nasi Lemak packs a nice spicy punch with the sambal, only wish the sambal was a little more.  The Otah / Otak packs a nice spicy taste,  to bad it was cold when i got it. The rice was just plain & lacking of the \"lemak\" taste. Kaya toast was just normal to me, and so was the half boiled eggs.\n\nDidn't try the curry chicken & roti prata. Might do so the next time.\n\nCoffee was really good.\n\nPlease bring your own tissues ya. They don't provide.",

Haven't had this since before the pandemic, when I used to work in the area.\n\nHappy to report the taste is still good as what I remember, serving still generous and chicken chop fried very nicely.\n\nThe only con is that price has increased, but I suppose that's true for most things now in Singapore. Will be back when craving strikes again.",
