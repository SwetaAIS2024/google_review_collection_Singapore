The waffles were crispy outside and soft on the inside. Really nice to eat but I prefer the red velvet abit more.\n\nIn fact, I think it's better than the birds of paradise and they let you taste the flavors. Their durian is way better than birds of paradise.\n\nHighly recommend,you wouldn't regret.",

Friendly owner!\n\nGot a 2 piece original waffle + double scoop for $13.10, went along with a mint for her and a mango for myself.\n\nMango sorbet hit the spot so well, perfect in this hot weather, perfect sweetness and texture for my palate.\n\nHad a bit of mango mixed in with the mint, and that was such a good combo of flavors too.\n\nMint flavor is definitely above average too, she was happily satisfied.",
