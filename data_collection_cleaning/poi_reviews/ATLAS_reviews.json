The towering gin collection and opulent gold accents made the ambiance truly special. The food was just as impressive; the lobster rolls were indulgent, and the prawn spaghetti was perfectly balanced in flavor. Service was impeccable, making the entire experience seamless and enjoyable. Whether for a casual evening or a special celebration, Atlas Bar is a place I‚Äôll keep coming back to.  ü•∞üôèüèª",

But you'll get more bang for your buck in other places. I wished the service was a bit more attentive for the price that's all. Definitely worth coming for the experience/decor and a few shameless selfies.",

However despite being full house the service and drinks are still impeccable.\nOur table was served by John and he was so patient and sincere despite them being busy. We had a wonderful time thanks to the nice drinks and the great service! When we left John even gave us a nice little surprise. We were super grateful.\nA must visit if you‚Äôre a tourist to Singapore. Make reservations first though.",
