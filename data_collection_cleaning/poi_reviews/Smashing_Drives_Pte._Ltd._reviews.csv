Ryan Chung,5,"Best fitter ever and the best at his craft!! Read the reviews here and have gone to him for adjustments of my wedges, and also did a driver/wedge/iron fitting with him and he was extremely patient while spending more time than he should to let me play around with different options! Extremely knowledgeable about his work and i have learnt a lot about golf clubs through him, and also gave me a few swing tips during the fitting which helped me tremendously!!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101255221153090516829/reviews
J L,5,Had an absolutely amazing driver shaft fitting session with Jef! He was very patient and provided effective feedback to help make adjustments to improve on my swing as I tried on different shafts. Ended up with the perfect shaft fit with straight drives! Highly recommended! Thanks again Jef!!,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112131495129975741214/reviews
Huiwen Ng,5,"Must go to Jef for fitting! He is really patient and approachable.

Being generally new to the game, I went for the first fitting session and couldnt hit my irons well. Wasted 15-20 mins of his time but he was so encouraging and asked me to take more time to stabilise my swing before going back to him.

1 month later, I finally went back and he fitted me with the T350s, adjusted for my height, angle and shaft stiffness. The differences were clear as I took shots alternating between my old iron and the fitted one.

Fast forward a few months later, I am enjoying the game so much more now and scoring better. I will always recommend my friends to get fitted, and get it done with Jef! Thanks Jef!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100165470867425228491/reviews
A Choy,5,"Jef is a great club fitter and an excellent sounding board for this frustrating game that we love. His technical skill is superb and his advice invaluable.

I have been going to Jef for for almost 3 years and have on multiple occasions bought clubs, fitted shafts and changed grips. His pricing is transparent, fair and definitely well worth it. I would highly recommend.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111303902970714602654/reviews
