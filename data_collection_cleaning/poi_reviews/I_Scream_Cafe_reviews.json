      "text": "I was just exploring the mall after having my coffee, and was attracted by the playful decor and gelato display. I ordered two tubs of premium gelato for takeaway which was carefully packed. I swear I saw the cafe owner did a little skip when she handed me my gelato - that's how enthusiastic (and genuine) she was in selling her ice cream, I guess. Anyway, both Belgium chocolate and mint chocolate were fantastic - my family members enjoyed them. It did melt a little on my way home but that also meant that no emulsifiers or preservatives were used. No complaints; I'll visit again.",

The bright colours and lighting sure is energising, making it a great place to keep your spirits up!\n\nThe coffee was good and the ice cream was delicious, but the recommendations and service that Stacy provided were truly outstanding, helping me to find a flavour I really enjoyed!",
