Noodles were springy and qqüòç, soup was light but really flavourful without being too salty - I wasn‚Äôt thirsty after finishing my meal. Cleared my bowl. Will definitely come by again for this!

Mee hoon kueh is very chewy and thicker than the ones I eat in other stores, portion is alright but if you order the dry one might not keep you full\n\nWill honestly come here again to eat :) really affordable ($4 a bowl) and good!",
