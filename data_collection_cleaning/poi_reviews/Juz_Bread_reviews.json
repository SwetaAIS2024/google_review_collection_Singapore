They say boss not in. Give me the phone talk to the admin handling finance, the admin told me, it was your mistake to key in wrongly, not ours. ðŸ¤¯ I am like, Ehat?!! So I canâ€™t get my 15.60$ remaining back. The guy in the shop gave me a number to call. I asked is it the boss? He said no, some admin or PA handling for boss, she can make decisions. I called this morning, NUMBER NOT IN SERVICE.\n\nI just want my $15.60 back, so hard?",
