      "text": "I went around the hawker centre at least two rounds just weighing my options for lunch after Friday's prayer session. Let's face it. Bedok Food Centre is a dangerous foodie paradise with so many classic and neu halal cuisines all under one roof so just about everything is inviting and attractive damn it. However, as I've indulged in rich but absolutely delicious Malay classic food from the earlier breakfast kick off I knew a lighter option is not only prudent but sensible. It is always harder to work after or go about when one is overly full and satiated.\n\nThen I remembered the last time I was here I had reminded myself to grab the Arabic classic kebab from Baraka Kebab. Although they are now on a pricier side at a hawker centre they are still cheaper than at restaurants, where you get the real authentic deal offered. So I settled for the chicken kebab although my greedy eyes were eyeing the hummus, salad and kunefe....and then I figuratively slapped myself silly.\n\nWell, for one the pita is more doughy in texture and is like a full loaf so even if you're a big eater like most men you'll be happy. One bite of the combination elevated by their sauce drenched onto the freshly cut vegetables paired with the charred edge  slow cooked chicken is like a happiness punch to your mouth that will make you do a happy dance in your belly. It's just so good.\n\nGo grab the freshly made food Baraka Kebab offers and you won't be disappointed.\n\nü´∂üèª",

Loaded with chicken, fries and a good mix of fresh salad on the side. Totally good for 2 pax.\n\nSeller had also packed three sauces in a cute way for my takeaway order. Haha\n\nUpdated price list as of 26 May 2024 :)",

      "text": "Rating based on the chicken kebab roll I ordered! Super generous portion, was so huge that I felt so full after eating it! Chicken is seasoned well and juicy, can taste some charred bits, paired with fresh vegetables,  yumz! Small downside for me is that I find that there's too much tomato and mayo sauce, which kinda overpowered the whole dish. In addition to that, the bottom part of the wrap is soaked in oil. Could be a tad oily for me! But other than that, the owners are friendly and will be back( maybe no sauce for me in the future)!",
