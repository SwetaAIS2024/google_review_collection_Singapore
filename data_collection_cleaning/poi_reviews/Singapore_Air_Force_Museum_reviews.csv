Asheesh Gupta,5,"This one should be a must visit for offbeat experience.
I traveled using public transport and it was on the direct bus route.
It would take around an hour to explore and take pictures.
The airplanes, helicopters and other display items are well maintained.
The only downside or challenge is it closes early around 4 pm.
I would recommend visiting here.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103289634858636555331/reviews
Derek Hardwick,4,"A very good display of older  jets, military aircraft, drones, anti aircraft missle systems. Lots of insignia and uniform displays. Models of military aircraft was excellent. Gift shop was very cramped, felt like a bull in a china shop. Caught the No.90 Bus out which stopped directly the front of the museum, No direct footpath into the museum carpark, had to walk on the road. Loved the ""Roar"" of the RSAF jets taking off from the runway next door. Would of been awesome if there was a viewing platform to actually see these jets.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115182406278439071027/reviews
Chris Partridge,4,"An interesting small museum. A very small collection of aircraft and nothing where you can actually get into an aircraft or helicopter cockpit.  A number of displays, including the F16 simulator were not working !!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107753370200078589873/reviews
chef chua,5,"Great museum piece, real life plane decommissioned, can take close up photo, kids are so excited, if only doors can open. There's a shop selling model plane and a small 15min theater showing RSAF. A gallery for history background.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113327938331691971810/reviews
Redwan Rahmat,5,"This museum is wonderful and highly recommended for aviation enthusiasts.  While the aircraft collection isn't extensive, each plane is accompanied by informative labels and detailed historical accounts. The museum building is modern and the exhibits are engaging.

There's a detailed history and emphasis on the A4s operated by the RSAF, along with some older models (Hawker Hunter, F5s and T33s)

Overall, it's a pleasant and well-organized experience.

There is also a small gift shop or souvenir shop where you can find patches and tokens.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116109231522237376506/reviews
