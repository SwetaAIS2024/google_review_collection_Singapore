Efficiency of Restaurant: 1000/10
- Easy & breezy order process. Best part is? $5 ISLANDWIDE delivery. slay

- Delivery is on time & prompt. Arranged for 8pm delivery, came just around there! üíØ

- ++++++ point: Halal certified too!

Pizza review: 8.5/10
- my parents & i love it! All of us agreed that the pizza dough is soft, totally agree with the other reviews written here. 10/10 for the dough!

- stuffed crust however, would give it a 7/10, as i feel the cheese in the crust could be slightly more. Pull wise i couldnt rly review it bc i didnt heat the pizza up (it came slightly warm but totally understandable bc my place is q far from their location)

- Formaggio is a bit salty as its a mixture of different types of cheese. But i still love it!

Sides Review: 1000/10
ROASTED DRUMLETS ARE SO GOOD
Wedges came w a small tub of barbecue sauce, yumssss

Shu Hui,5,"Found Four Pizza on foodpanda but decided to buy directly as there's 1-for-1 pizza and read good reviews. I was not disappointed. I ordered two pizzas (BBQ Chicken and Pesto Veggie) and spicy roasted middle wings for delivery. Both pizzas were great and still hot upon arrival. I included a note to arrive nearer to 1pm as the delivery slot was 12.30-1pm, and the delivery person arrived around 1pm! Really appreciate it. Recommended Four Pizza to a friend and she'll be ordering for New Year celebration!

Suggestion: Add a vegetarian option under Premium pizza.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108478916277813511029/reviews
William Lu,5,"Bought personal pizza on take-away for my lunch. It was quite filling for lunch. Seems their personal pizza was a little bigger compared to other pizza chain with personal size. There are 5 options of drink there, 3 sodas and 2 canned teas. It was quick and ready in 10 minutes.

Take-away or delivery only for this outlet.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
