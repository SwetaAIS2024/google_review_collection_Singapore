The pig intestines on skewer was not good as it was not well cleaned.\n\nThe fish was a very decent serving of the price, nice and neat place and service was decent. Has a large selection of alcoholic beverages.",

Got the grilled fish at $14.40 and chilli chicken for $1.99. Really value for money. Food portion is reasonable and taste is good. Will come again.",
