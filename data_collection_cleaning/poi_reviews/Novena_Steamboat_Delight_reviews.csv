K. W.,4,"Simple and nice steamboat, basic soup base, not too thick. Ingredients like beef and seafood was very fresh and clam was cleaned properly. Overall felt like home cooked style hotpot, even wanton was ownself made(?) Nice chili sauce and friendly staff.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116411716861845522671/reviews
danny gow,2,"This restaurant food is ok but what is so dissapointing about this restaurant is that though it was stated that there shld be no wastage of food else would be charged , the owner of restaurant don't have to scouge thru our food n soup to look for food leftover before deciding if we are clear to go . It is so embarrassing and unprofessional in my opinion . This will be my last time to visit this place . A simple lunch buffet for 3 w 3 standard drinks sets us back $127.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116153530810831964700/reviews
Leow Een Tiong,4,"First visit as it’s near my Sis place. Service is good. We went for the ala carte with tomato and chicken soup base, the tomato one is really good. Ingredients are fresh. If U’re opting for the weekday buffet promo, note that the promo price is excluding the soup base. The ambience is really good too, nice and cosy place. Will come back again. Oh, the beer is cheap, but glad I did not order as I ran out of space.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101722626543535599152/reviews
Mabel Low,4,Always delighted to visit Novena Steamboat. Cosy eating place to gather with family and friends over hotpot and sake.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105278938809514561831/reviews
Ritchie Li,2,"Food quality is there, but taste was so so. Very expensive, like $11 for a small serving of pork belly. Based on total price, makes Hai Di Lao look very affordable and reaaonably priced.

Nonetheless, this is a good place to go if you have no better alternative as there are usually seats available.

Recommended to stick to cooked dishes here, like zhi char restaurant instead.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100353451087931864909/reviews
