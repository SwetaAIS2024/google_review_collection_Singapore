      "text": "INTOLERABLE LIE : I recently shopped at Cold Storage and decided to grab some items from their Reduced to Clear section, expecting to get discounted prices as advertised. But surprise, surprise‚Äîwhen I got to the checkout, none of the products were actually reduced! The only exception was one package of cookies, which had a proper discount label (La Belleza, as seen in the photo).\n\nSo what‚Äôs going on here? How can a big supermarket chain mislead customers like this? If a section claims to have reduced prices, every item there should be marked down‚Äînot just one random product. This feels like a blatant attempt to trick shoppers into thinking they‚Äôre getting a deal when they‚Äôre not.\n\nI‚Äôm done with Cold Storage. There are plenty of better options around, like Fair Price and small local grocery shops, where you actually get the deals you expect. If you value honesty in pricing, I‚Äôd suggest shopping elsewhere.",

She said ok.\n\nProceeded to scan Yuu and the Yuu voucher but said to wait at the end for AIA.\n\nAfter scanning, told me I can‚Äôt use AIA cause she already used the Yuu. And I‚Äôm like bewildered. Asked again and said she can‚Äôt ‚Äúgo back‚Äù cause the Yuu was already scanned.\n\nWas quite annoyed cause the logic was not there. Clarified again and she said she thought I was using AIA voucher. Didn‚Äôt even bother apologising and just insisted that she ‚Äúcan‚Äôt go back‚Äù.\n\nWas so annoyed that I wanted to just cancel the whole dam thing. Should have done so on hindsight.\n\nEnded up not claiming my AIA vitality cashback which was up to $8. Such is unskilled labor.",
