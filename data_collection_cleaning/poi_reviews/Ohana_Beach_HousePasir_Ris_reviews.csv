jisoo jang (40대꿈많은소년),5,"I recently rediscovered this place, and the steak is truly delicious. The prices are affordable, and its location by the beach creates a great atmosphere. I highly recommend it as a date spot for couples in love.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110538496773935266937/reviews
W Lee,3,Convenient place to chill and enjoy the sea breeze. Bar gets filled pretty quickly in the evening when live band is performing. Food could have been better. Chicken burger was underwhelming to say the least.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106966917528166316205/reviews
Laura,3,"Worst steak ever. Even by a bar standard. Completely burnt and bitter taste. Ordered medium.

Would've given 1 star if not because staff was helpful to rectify the situation.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111333179502430066850/reviews
MHong Cheung,4,"The place has good vibes with food with generous portions. Staff was friendly and helpful. We got a margherita pizza, soup of the day and softshell crab pasta and the food came quickly. The shrawberry milkshake was blended immediately and served quickly too! There were lizards but they were just there to accompany our dinner experience. Will come again!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112489288430816321322/reviews
Marco Ullasci,3,"The view is nice if you sit in the outdoor part overlooking the beach.
Food is not always available.
Service sometimes is on the slow side.
Once you add service and gst an happy hour Guinness is ~16sgd",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114932519086395667883/reviews
