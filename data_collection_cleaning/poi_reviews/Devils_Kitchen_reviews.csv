Jill Lim,5,"Chanced upon this eatery. It has a good spread of appetizers, mains and beverages. We tried the battered fried shiitake mushrooms, mushroom soup, pan seared halibut and salmon served with 2 sides (mashed potatoes & barley salad), and carbonara, they did NOT disappoint! Though the bill came up to ~$90 but the dishes were tasty and to my liking, particularly the fish (I’m a foodie and fussy with fish). I’d go back again from the north.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113047015886526031327/reviews
George,5,"Decided to try this place for dinner. Was not dissapointed.
Had the Fried Fish Fillet, Tomato Cheese Baked Portobello and the Grilled Ribeye Steak.
The fish was so so, pretty flat but tasty.
Portobello was fantastic the cheese and mushroom medly was exceptional and i highly recommend.
Steak came with a barley side and mash and was cooked perfectly to medium rare.
Recommend overall to try.
Decor was great but lights were a tad bit bright in some seat locations.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102282579836549796497/reviews

Faye Yap (叶栩绯),5,"I’ve eaten here a few times since it’s near my workplace, and I find that the food is great! But it could be a little bit on the pricier side. However, this burger for example, had a really big portion, and definitely will be enough for you to feel satiated for a long while.

Do note that there is usually only one person working, so waiting times may take a little while if there are other customers dining in as well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101750484940912874032/reviews
Kelvin Chye,5,"Overall a nice place to chill and dine. Food wise, a good selection of western dishes to choose from. Personally, find the truffle fries and iberico pork good, and will recommend them. The other dishes we ordered was good as well. It was a good dining experience for my group of 6.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117999709976505884094/reviews
