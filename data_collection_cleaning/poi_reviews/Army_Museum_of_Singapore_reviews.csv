Eddie Koh,4,"Small exhibition on army's history. Several military vehicles on display outdoors. Enjoyed the IMT (indoor computerised shooting), where M16 and SAR21 were available.

Lack adequate signage, and has an unwelcoming feel, with main entrance hidden on level 3, behind opaque doors.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108330992002812049697/reviews
