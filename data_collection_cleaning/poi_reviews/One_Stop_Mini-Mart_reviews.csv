Minhah Musfirah,1,"I went to print items over there, the staff shouted at me when I was trying to explain that I wasn’t receiving what I sent and I even told him that I know it isn’t his fault maybe is the system fault but what I was sending is diff from what he is printing. He just cut up the papers and just started raising his voice at me and was really rude. Very ridiculous, I wasn’t even being rude I was ready to pay everything else but the ONE wrong paper printed because what I sent and even showed him what I sent was very different. He printed out something like a screenshot and refused to accept the fact that I shouldn’t be paying for something that was the stores fault. Ridiculous I will bring it up to the higher up because being shouted at is horrible when I was talking to him at such a calming manner.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108259445646412995120/reviews

Jonathan Tan,4,"A pretty decent convenience store. It changed owners not too long ago. Current owners aren't as friendly as the previous ones. But I'll give them some time to warm up.

Otherwise, the shop is what you'd expect convenient stores to be... Convenient. They have most essentials, and are open 24 hours. They are of course pricier than a supermarket or market. That's the price of convenience.

One major major plus point for me is that they stock OREO ICE CREAM STICKS.

These. Are. The. Bomb.

And you can't get them at regular shops. One Stop Mini-Mart has all my love just for this one product.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107847632034865861643/reviews
