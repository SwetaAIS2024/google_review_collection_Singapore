Many cool plant growth offers good scenery for pictures and admiring the beauty.\n\nFurther up the trail there is washrooms and fresh, cold water for filling up water bottles, along with places to sit.\n\nWould not suggest eating there as monkeys regularly attack people for food! My brother was attacked and his food was stolen. As long as you keep it in your bag they are very tame.",
