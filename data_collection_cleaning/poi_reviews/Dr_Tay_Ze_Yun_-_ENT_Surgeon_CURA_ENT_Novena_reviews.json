The treatment was carried out with great care, and I experienced no pain or discomfort at all.\n\nThe only downside was the waiting timeâ€”I had an appointment scheduled for 4:00 PM but had to wait for about 30 minutes. I hope future scheduling can be managed more precisely, perhaps by allowing some buffer time between appointments.\n\nThank you for your attention, and I look forward to continued care with your team.",
