      "text": "I was at SAFTMI pass office this morning to obtain a parking label to park in premises for meeting.  Encountered the most unpleasant and insolent MP 3SG Collin and his 3WO FD Lim. I mistook the glass window counter to be the place to change pass. When I finally found the right place which was to enter a dark glass door, I was shouted at by 3SG Collin. 3WO F D Lim was called in but was unhelpful by using jargons like \"white listing\", expecting a civilian to comprehend what it means! Overall, the behaviour of the military police were uncalled for and unprofessional and they acted like thugs, bringing down the image of SAFTIMI.",

Shuttle bus took forever to start and crowd at waiting point had to wait with no directions as there were no signboards or labels for the meeting point. OCS organizes family day once every 3 months and still can't get it right?\nInvitation form for the family clear states of attire restriction but no one enforces on the rules. Why put it down in then? Disappointment in the management. Can you do better?",
