S Y,5,"Dr Brian’s wholehearted commitment to optimising his patients’ well-being is evident through his meticulous assessment of patients’ symptoms and selection of appropriate investigative tests for accurate diagnoses and timely interventions.

My 71 year old mother had been seeing another cardiologist for many years, and despite regular check-ups, her heart valve regurgitation issue remained undetected until it progressed to the last stage of ‘symptomatic severe’. We decided to consult another cardiologist and it was truly a godsend that we were recommended by my mum’s GP to see Dr Brian Khoo, who promptly discovered the severity of her valve disease in the nick of time.

My mum’s health deteriorated very quickly, but Dr Khoo managed to stabilise her condition (through appropriate in-patient medication), so that she was well enough to undergo a heart valve replacement surgery with relatively low risk.

Dr Khoo recommended an excellent cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Kang Ning, for my mum’s operation, which turned out to be a great success in solving her heart valve problem. With top-notch care from these two remarkable doctors, my mum recovered well enough to resume driving 5 weeks after her open heart surgery.

Dr Brian’s tireless dedication to safeguarding his patients’ health also shines through in his attentive monitoring of my mum’s post-op condition and careful adjustments of her medications. He is always reassuring, encouraging and patient in his explanations.

We are immensely thankful for Dr Brian. His exceptional professionalism and kindness are truly first-class. We highly recommend him to anyone in need of a heart specialist!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114569231582940756419/reviews

eddie YANG,5,"everything is top notch...👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
from the making of appointment, the reminders sent, to the day of visit, and the attentiveness from everyone.
Not to mention Dr.Brian with his superb memory to know the progress of our conditions without referring to past records.
Totally open and frank, and never once push for certain procedures just because they are ""covered"" by insurance...✌🏼",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115220685651224398848/reviews
