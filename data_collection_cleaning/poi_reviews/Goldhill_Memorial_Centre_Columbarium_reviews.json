I'm almost getting nirvana, but Luckily I meet an agent and got an offer from her too.\nThis place is a very private columbarium. Strong WiFi, air-conditioning and it is not crowded at all. Most importantly this columbarium are surrounded by good fengshui.\n\nHighly recommend.\nMay contact the agent if wanna visit the place or get the offer 96340500",
