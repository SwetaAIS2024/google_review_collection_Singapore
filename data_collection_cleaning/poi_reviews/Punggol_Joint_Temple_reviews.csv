Raymond Tay,5,"The deities, gods etc are the ones from my faith. We share the same faith as the southern Chinese and Taiwan. I’m glad they’re still around and worth a visit if you are into old temples. Give it a visit.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110897033209560123249/reviews

LEE YI,3,"Very good temple, only the middle sector one(guan gong miao) which I like, there are nice and friendly assistants especially one uncle really helps when praying and explaining deities we praying to and the aura is gr8. The right hand side which I pray to for taisui ye for 2023, the temple assistants are not as gr8 as expected, instead there is one guy who is really rude when explaining the procedure of praying rituals and such. I respect the gods but for the people there I will not visit again!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110800097552079197149/reviews
