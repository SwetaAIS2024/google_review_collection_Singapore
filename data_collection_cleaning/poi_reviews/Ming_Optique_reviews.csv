Ram Nath,5,"This is my goto place for optical requirements. I was free and wanted to get my eyesight checked as the vision was slightly blurry with my current prescription.

Got a quick response and an early appointment for the same day with Ming Optique at 58 Marine Terrace.

I travelled 30 minutes and arrived on time, and I was greeted politely by Veron and Daniel. Daniel patiently, professionally, and thoroughly checked my eyes.

I waited comfortably for 10 minutes for new lenses to be created and fitted to my existing spectacle frame, with good pricing.

I got great insights regarding contact lenses and reading glasses.

I am happy with and totally recommend contacting Ming Optique for your optical needs.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117217799156461978724/reviews
Ella G,5,"Would absolutely recommend coming to Ming Optique.

I accidentally sat on my glasses, bending them. A lens even popped out. Ming Optique kindly helped me to repair my glasses on the spot, and free of charge. Am really appreciative for the wonderful service. Will be back and will recommend that my friends and family come support :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110121051785217674097/reviews
Srabani Samanta,5,"Best experience. Mr Daniel & his wife are kind, polite & sincere people. Always has the customers at the heart of what they do.
Very diligent with his work and will give sincere advice not just trying to sell more expensive lens.
This helps to build trust.
I have been going back to them over more than one year now and would highly recommend to anyone.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115190794290883148484/reviews
HuiHui Lin,5,"I had a very good experience at Ming Optique. Mr Daniel is very professional. He and Veronica are friendly and very helpful. I have been going to different optical shops for over 20 years, and my visit to Ming Optique (which I learned of only recently) has been a wonderful experience for me. I will be going back again. Highly recommended.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118113657692755234667/reviews
Yvonne Durand,5,"It's been a real pleasure and fun to get my new glasses at Ming Optique. Daniel & Veron are true experts in their field and their advice, recommendations and inputs were extremely helpful. Their passion is contagious and I wish I had discovered this little place much earlier. I had some challenges to get glasses since I need a rather small model but they could help me out in no time and with candid feedback. The shop seems rather small but they do cover the spectrum plus they know what fits and what doesn't.

Thank you both for your support and all the very best. Until we meet again :)",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112318362829893206114/reviews
