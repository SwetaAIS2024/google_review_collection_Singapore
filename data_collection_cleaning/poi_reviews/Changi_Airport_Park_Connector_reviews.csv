Jonathan Hiew,4,Its a PCN less than 5KM end to end. Of interest is that it leads right into the Airport. Attraction is the Jurassic Mile which features dinosaurs. It is exactly one mile (1.6 KM) long. It can be accessed from T4 if you just want to visit the Jurassic Mile.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106611639464075912591/reviews
Anthony Neo,5,"The Park Connector starts from either Terminal 4 or  Changi Coast Walk near MOE CCAC. The distance for a one way walk will be ~2.5km, thus a two way walk will be 5km ~1 hours.
The most interesting part of the walk is the Changi Jurassic Mile where there are replica of Dinosaurs along a 1km stretch of walking/cycling shared path.
Good fun for a nice family walk!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109337725753122165703/reviews
KZ Seet,5,"New PCN leading to Changi Airport which Iâ€™ve explored before they officially opened. The shared path is narrow, so better to dismount and push your bike.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101854144840718025617/reviews
Wayne S,5,"Also known as the Changi Jurassic Mile - it is ironically one kilometer of permanent static exhibits featuring around 22 different dinosaurs.

The path is a shared one so riding at speed is not advised (especially since there are designated photo taking spots that sit within the path (and not adjacent to it)).

All in all a fantastic side trip and wonderful initiative!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101105309759416303120/reviews
