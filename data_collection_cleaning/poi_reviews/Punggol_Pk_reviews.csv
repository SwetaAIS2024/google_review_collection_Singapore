Melvyn Tan,5,"An extremely potential park for further enhancement.  As it is now it's a wonderful park for relaxation with plenty of rest stops and varied plants if you are into it.   This park also connects to the connector to punggol waterway point, along the way you will see the river with frequent sightings of otters and river birds.   There are plenty of rest stops and restrooms so do not worry.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106426639182130883338/reviews
