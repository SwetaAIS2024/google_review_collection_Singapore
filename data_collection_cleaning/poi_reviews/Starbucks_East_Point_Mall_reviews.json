I was just trying to order a drink but the ladies were visibly annoyed to take order. The lady with the black apron took my order and was really reluctant to take it. It was as if I did something wrong and she was just unhappy that she has to do her job.\n\nAlthough I rated 2 stars, I‚Äôd like to rate a 5 star for the male staff that had to fix all the drinks on his own while the 2 ladies chat away. They DID NOT offer any help at all. I could tell that he had been working away alone by the way they are not communicating. I for one do not tolerate workplace bullying so I hope this is not it.\n\nPlease do something about it.",
