One of the customers service explained that please come again after the physical pass has been issued.\n\nAfter physical pass being issued, they said they need proof of residence. Submitted proof of residence, they said should be in the company letterhead (which was already printed with company letterhead and proper address). Then another excuse came saying that my company is not registered in their bank, etc.\n\nIn conclusion, wasted my time here‚Ä¶\n\nThen went to 2 others bank. With exactly same proof of residence, Can opened the account without any issues.",

From the moment we interacted with this person, she was already showing us an unhappy face. She even shouted and yelled at us. We are told as customers to respect the workers but if the workers dont even respect the customers, then clearly this job is not for her.",

      "text": "I am having the worst experience with OCBC Bank, far worse than I‚Äôve ever had with any other bank in my life. Here is my story: Starting from October 10, spammers began withdrawing money from my account every few days, continuing until December 18.\n\nWhen I called the bank, the representative said they would block my cards and asked me to send a report listing all unauthorized transactions. However, they failed to inform me that I would lose access to my mobile banking app. They flagged only a few recent fraudulent payments (eight transactions), and that was it. Now, I no longer have access to my statements, and my bank managers refuse to share my personal account data with me‚Äîeven though it‚Äôs my right. Without this information, I cannot provide the bank with a full list of the fraudulent transactions. They are not willing to help.\n\nThe next day, I called again to ask how I could regain access to my account, but another representative told me it was no longer possible. They also said I couldn‚Äôt retrieve a full report of my transactions. I explained that this is my personal information and that I have the right to access it. I asked to speak with a manager to resolve the issue, but they refused and eventually hung up on me.\n\nI decided to follow up via email. I sent my passport details and requested the transaction reports, but no one responded. In their email, they stated that I needed to fill out a form listing all disputed transactions within five days‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt even possible for me to access the data. No one was willing to help or provide my own information!\n\nThe bank also informed me that I could only dispute transactions made within the past 45 days, which made me feel like they were scamming me. No one answered my questions or provided a solution, dragging out the process unnecessarily. Every day, I lose the chance to recover my money.\n\nBefore Christmas, my manager finally said she would send me my statements the next day. But when the next day came, the bank‚Äôs system was down, and she didn‚Äôt even update me until I asked. Then she told me it was Christmas time, and they wouldn‚Äôt be working. Shortly after, she stopped working at the bank entirely, and now I have a new manager.\n\nThis bank is completely insecure. They didn‚Äôt even notice that these transactions were suspicious‚Äîdespite being made in the U.S., a country I‚Äôve never visited or even had a visa for. I feel scammed, both by the fraudsters and by OCBC Bank, which seems to be letting this slide without taking any responsibility. Their customer service is the worst I‚Äôve ever encountered. I strongly discourage anyone from using this bank to avoid losing their money like I did.",
