Henry Cheng,5,"If you're a fan of chicken rice, Shao La Zai at Midpoint Orchard is the place to be. This place serves one of the best chicken rice dishes I've ever had. The rice is aromatic and perfectly cooked, making it easily one of the top three in Singapore.

The roast pork is simply divine. The skin is super crispy, and there's a perfect balance of fat and lean meat that leaves you wanting more. If you're a fan of liver, their creamy liver is a must-try.

And it doesn't stop there. Their noodles with roast duck are equally impressive—tender, flavorful, and absolutely satisfying.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151994390288524704/reviews
