Ming,5,Really good coffee at affordable price! Tried the hot Seoul city latte (espresso + milk + bamboo charcoal) cos it was on promo. The taste was unique with a little bit of saltiness and sweetness not overpowering the coffee and texture was bold and smooth. Hot cappuccino was really good too. Friendly service.

* Kat *,5,"Really lovely spot at the City Gate shopping center. I had a pretty good soy matcha latte and a crispy cronut... so good! Nice ambiance with soft K-Pop in the background and on a Saturday late morning also very busy, but I managed to grab a seat and my order was ready surprisingly fast.

To my surprise I received all my items in biodegradable packaging. What a nice surprise! That's not at all common here in Singapore and very much appreciated.

Veredict: instead of running to Starbucks across the street at the Concouse, show your support to this local business that's doing everything right. It won't disappoint.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111958477706304374583/reviews
Bobby Lim,5,"Was greeted and served by Xin Yi. She is a nice lady with a very welcoming smile, coffee is great and totally love the shop's environment.
Very comfortable place to sit in and have a break while enjoying their coffees.

Marcus Huang,5,"Just happen to walk by as they were closing. Had no prior knowledge or impression of this place, but just had a craving for a drink. Usually I have coffee, but for some reason felt inclined to get a Dirty Matcha Latte hot. Ho man was it good! I was expecting so-so, but was I pleasantly surprised! So surprised that before driving off, just felt moved to leave a good review! Gotta have to try the other stuff now.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103831198180341507237/reviews
