Portion is huge but the duck is ....dry n got a duck smell and I found 2 maggots üêõ at the vegetables leaf ...
Didn't know there's extra protein added .

Phylicia Lim,1,"Please don‚Äôt try the Chinese stall that sell mala and other China dishes. Portions looks good but waiting time is so long. Mala not much variety too. Only order unless u can wait, only 1 chef and 1 doing cashier and prepping ingredients. We waited closed to 25 minutes for our mala, and there wasn‚Äôt queue. Recommend to try the ÁÇñÊ±§ stall or Thai food stall, reasonably priced and food is good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117839451090594765533/reviews
Gabby Fantasy,5,"Delicious wan tan noodles are found here.
$3 to begin with if you are unsure.
The noodles are that light yellow ones.
The owner of the stall is normally not pushy about selling you a bigger bowl. I am not sure why.üôÑ
Anyways for $6 ( noodles and dumpling soup, this fills my stomach.
I am satisfied.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101655359401510706082/reviews

G C,5,"Delicious and perhaps the best pao fan I ever had. Ordered the lala pao fan - broth was thick and flavorful, lala was fresh, price was affordable. We also ordered the herbal black chicken which was excellent with soft and tender meat. The lady attending the stall was also super friendly and kind. She even offered me a pair of chopsticks after seeing mine dropped üòÇ Glad to find such a gem here!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110016450061254703150/reviews
