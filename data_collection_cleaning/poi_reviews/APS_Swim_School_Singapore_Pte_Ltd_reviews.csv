Stella S,5,"Saw my daughter improve by leaps and bounds since joining APS at ACJC about 7 months ago. Shout-out to Coach Dee who showers the girls in her class with so much patience and love, even preparing gifts for my daughterâ€™s birthday and giving out Hari Raya green packets at her own expense. Even though we donâ€™t live near the school, we definitely think itâ€™s well worth the commute.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100481472972291327201/reviews
