Jyn X,5,"Highly recommend. Saw Physician Ho for pregnancy, and we really appreciate how friendly, caring and attentive she is. She also patiently answers all the questions we have, and shares useful knowledge. It’s been about a year since we started seeing her and we just welcomed a healthy baby girl, we’re very grateful for her help!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117304559528164949144/reviews
Winnie Lim,5,"I have chronic migraines that seem to be related to my menstrual cycle, so I started seeing Physician Ho in mid 2022. Both my migraines and menstrual symptoms have greatly improved since. I appreciated that Thomson TCM and her seemed to specialise in women's health, whereas the TCM practitioners I had seen before were more generalist. I am thankful to Physician Ho for always taking the time to explain when I ask questions, and she keeps a very open mind when we discuss health interventions that may not be TCM related.

My health had a setback when I had gotten covid in mid 2023, and Physician Ho nursed me back to health again. Each time I had different health issues – even a tooth infection that required antibiotics, I relied on Physician Ho to restore the homeostatic balance in my body. And of course I have to mention Shirley, who has been very kind and helpful to me too, especially sometimes when I have to reschedule my appointments. Grateful for the care over the years.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110108391314522821511/reviews
Jia Juan Ling,5,I am suffering from a nerve condition. Tried various well-known TCM physicians but no improvement. Phy Ho came recommended and decided to try her. My condition improved:) Another was my pregnancy when I had a little complication in the beginning. Phy Ho and Shirley assisted me very quickly and promptly. My pregnancy is going well now. Both of them simply deserve more than 5-stars!,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104310962726261313740/reviews
