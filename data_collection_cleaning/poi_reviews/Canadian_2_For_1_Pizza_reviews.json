It was just the dough only nothing inside it.\n\nNever recommend to others and don't want to order again from the same place.\n\nDomino's $5 Pizza is much better than this Canadian Pizza.",

Female Indian staff was using the video call option on her phone and talking while customers were waiting outside. She did not bother to stop the call even while handing the customer their food. Can tell they do not take pride in customer service.",
