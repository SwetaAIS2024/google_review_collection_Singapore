      "text": "Highlighted reviews of this place were on its affordability, which made me excited. However, I must say such claims were either of the past and untrue now or purely false.\n\n$7 for a 3 dish nasi padang and teh tarik - is the affordability in the room with us?\n\nWhile I understand the opaque nature of nasi padang pricing, I could not wrap my head around the price for my dishes (picture for reference) Calling this place affordable is akin to calling this place a cafe, its a cafe in name but has no features of a 'cafe' whatsoever.\n\nNow despite the initial set back I was still willing to be open to the taste as a form of redemption. However, I was left sorely disappointed.\n\nLong beans were great, probably the best out of the three. Bergedil was average but the chicken wing. The chicken wing was blatantly frozen, and being left out in the open made it a sorry state. There was no element of my meal being a 'Muslim meal', rather cheap components of frozen food placed together. I came at about 10:30 am so I don't think the time argument can do much justice here.\n\nTeh Tarik was okay, nothing out of the ordinary\n\nOverall, I was disappointed and the high price definitely added to this feeling of disappointment. An added word of caution, the person before me ordered a 4 dish nasi padang (with fish as one dish) and a gado gado which added up to $25.\n\nBe aware of the transparency pricing issue and if you're feeling frisky, don't order their seafood. Then again if you go for their seafood I probably wouldn't count it on them to be delicious and well worth the price either.",
