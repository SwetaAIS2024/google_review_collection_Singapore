      "text": "The gelato here is a mix . Some are smooth but some look watery.\nBut as a neighborhood ice cream shop which is smack in between a popular Penang food restaurant and an Indian restaurant, ice cream is a welcome dessert!\nAlthough most of the flavours are too sweet for my liking and lacking the creamy gelato taste, I would recommend the cafe itself for a chill place to relax and meet up with friends\nCute ice cream shaped seats are outside and their are soft toys within the shop.\nThis shop also has a membership where regulars can get $1 off their purchases.\nHence not too bad for a small place.",

      "text": "A small, charming dessert spot in West Coast. It was my first time but the relaxed atmosphere made me feel comfortable straight away. The inside chairs have cute cushions to accompany you which added to the sweet surroundings as the walls were plastered with vibrant, adorable drawings.\n\nThe ice cream was delicious, I got the caramel biscotti on top of a smores waffle. I found my waffle to be lacking in the smores flavour despite having melted marshmallow and chocolates inside it, perhaps add more chocolate or drizzle chocolate sauce on top? Apart from that, the sweets, including the milkshake, was amazing.\n\nThe savoury, the takoyaki, on the other hand, was a little disappointing. I felt like it was too chewy on the inside and lacking in the condiments. Takoyaki usually has the brown takoyaki sauce with kewpie mayo and lots of bonito flakes but mine only came with a handful of bonito flakes and lacked the takoyaki sauce. Moreover, the takoyaki was more chewy than crispy, as even the outer layer was very soft and cute be cut open with the stick. Despite this, I found the price for be very reasonable and would buy it again.\n\nI really enjoyed how this cafe offered both sweets and savoury and next time, I will definitely try the omelette waffle!\n\nOverall, I find this spot to be a lovely place to visit if youâ€™re around town and desire a quick bite! The owner is nice and friendly and the place is really good for pictures.",

We also always bought it for house warming.\n\nToday we went back and visually could already tell the ice cream doesnt look v fresh, abit melty. All the flavours tasted off and the ice cream texture was not creamy. Not sure what happened to them, but will not recommend.",

Everything in this cafe is almost perfect.\n\nIf I have to nitpick, it would be the chocolate sauce on the ice cream waffles. I would have liked it a lot more if they offer maple syrup on the side instead. That said, I will definitely revisit this cafe.",
