All seems to be engrossed in doing their work despite multiple \"hello\", \"hi\" and \"excuse me\". Perhaps they are waiting for one another to attend to the long queue.\n\nThere seems to be additional fee when paying using Changi Pay. You will need to pay S$6.60 for the S$6.50 every day value meal.",
