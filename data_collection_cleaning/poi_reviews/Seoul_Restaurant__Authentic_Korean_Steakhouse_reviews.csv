Fredric Ng,5,My colleague arranged a lunch gathering at Seoul at the Conrad. Food was superb. Meat was fresh and pancakes were crispy. Service was excellent. Grill was exchanged and bonchon was refreshed constantly. We were greeted by the manager near the end of our meal! Definitely will return again. Thank you for an amazing experience!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105581382496958283264/reviews
Carl Lee (iamCARLLEE),5,"Will recommend to go for the premium ala carte buffet if you are considering going there on your first visit with deep pockets.

Quality of the meat is top notch and offers a variety of different types of Korean cuisine on the premium set.

Best place to have your couple dates or someone precious.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111112833767864789403/reviews
cs y,3,"Had the buffet dinner, so there wasn't much service provided. The food is above average but not fantastic. Will not say that it's worth the price. There are several private rooms which is nice for small gathering. Will take more to go back again.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113127090056950065650/reviews

Germaine Tay,5,We opted for the normal buffet (the second tier) which included beef. It was around $70 per pax and we really enjoyed the food. I like that the buffet included other things like stews. Side dishes were great too!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102099945342582955689/reviews
