      "text": "I would say this is 4.5 stars. Food is great but not amazing. Feels very homely.\n\nWe had the seafood soup in medium because the small didnt have prawn. The prawn was soso; I would go for small next time. I really love the soup though. Slightly sweet and goes great with the kway teow. I understand why some people would find it bland, but this is perfect for me. I think the fishball noodle uses the same soup base.\n\nFish cake is nice but nothing special. Goes well with chilli. Kaya toast is very homely - feels like something that we could make and eat at home - but not amazing.\n\nOverall 4.5 stars for the food quality versus value. Wouldnt mind making a pitstop here again on the way to KL.",

We also ordered fish meat soup. The fish meat given was quite a lot, given RM 12 a bowl. But the soup is a little on the sweet side for me. The boss said he uses rock sugar which is healthier than normal sugar. I like savoury soup. Kopi C and Teh C kosong were good too. In fact the best ones I had in Bukit Indah, Eco botanic area.",

We ordered Fish Maw Soup, Homemade Fish Cake, Plain Noodles and Coffee.\nFish Cake came first, hot and freshly fried. Skin is chrispy.\n\nWorried the Fish Maw Soup would taste \"too fishy\", surprised it is not. Soup is clear and quite tasty.\n\nWished the noodles could have been \"blacker\" as I love black noodles. But still taste ok and not \"over-cook\".\n\nThough the Coffee are \"less sugar\", however, we felt \"milk\" is kind of more and the coffee still taste a little too sweet.",
