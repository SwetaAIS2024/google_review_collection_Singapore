Hrmgr,3,Tried the Cai Peng at this coffee shop. Price reasonable at $5 for a 2 meat 2 veg dishes though the food is usual and nothing much to mention. Probably few customers during day time in this area so choices are limited.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews

Myra Goon,5,"Stumbled upon this place and decided to try because the char siew and siew yok looked really good. Ordered a char siew noodle ($4.50) and roasted pork noodle ($4.50), both were damn good.

The char siew was slightly fatty, the noodles were cooked perfectly with a springy texture, the sauce was slightly sweet and penetrated the noodles very well, super flavourful and not clumpy, topped with some pork lard. The roasted pork skin was so crispy you can hear yourself chewing it, noodles that came with it were a bit drier than the char siew noodles but also very flavourful, pork may have been a bit salty for some people but great for us.

After the success of the noodles, decided to order a hot yuan yang ($1.30) and assam laksa ($5.50). Yuan yang was very balanced between the coffee and tea, was very happy with it. Assam laksa was just like what you get in Penang with the onions, pineapple and fish. It was a bit too spicy for me but the bf thought it was just nice. The uncle in the shop very nice, offered us extra bowl so we can share the laksa.

Overall will defo come back and eat again, food is very affordable and great.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101279978050800333717/reviews
