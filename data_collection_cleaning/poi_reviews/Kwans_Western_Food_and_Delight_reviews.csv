S,5,"This place deserves a shoutout. I’ve ordered them via grabfood twice and never disappointed (never tried it at the physical store before tho). Food’s good, portion’s big and price is reasonable even for delivery.

Chicken chop fried rice - fried rice includes bean sprout, charsiew, hotdog and taste like what you can find at typical tzechar stall (even better than some tzechar). Chicken chop is of standard size too.

Chicken cutlet - crispy, thin crust, good size. They even packed the fries + garlic bread in another bag! Small but thoughtful gesture.

Old school western stall that serves comfort food. Do try it if you have a chance.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101621206422743155524/reviews
Andre Karl Misso,3,"It is what it is!
It’s smack in an industrial estate, packed with people who have limited options in the vicinity. Kwan’s has a wide menu selection. From the price and quality I got, a wide menu selection compensated for price and quality... I guess.

Managed by an elderly couple, they were moving fast in the kitchen getting orders out. You would need to shout when you speak, because you were shouted at when asked, “You want?”  LOL it was an experience. Still they are a happy looking couple churning out dishes for customers.

The queue was long during lunch. Might have been to the lack of options around us and the unbearable heat to walk further out.

I ordered the Chicken Chop for $6.00. Reasonable, I think. But I laughed when I saw a sign that said: “Photo for illustration purpose only.” While waiting for my order, I had that sinking feeling of a bad decision. Oh dear, basic buyer’s remorse.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104188194322810086220/reviews
white ghost,1,"Fries very little, my son only ate 5 fries when picture was taken.  Even he said it wasn't enough.
The fries are dry.
The beans small about 1 tablespoon were cold and watery.
The garlic bread had a hint of garlic probably stroke the bread when it used to be bread.  Was toasted so much it was no longer bread or toast but had transformed into a crouton.
The coleslaw was ok but small still but I'm not a fan of coleslaw.
The fish was perfectly cooked on the outside,  the hot wet interior well..... it was wet.

I'd prefer to pay more and go to Astons, where the food is a better quality.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101171432176826511902/reviews
Kayle Gan,1,"Food is good and price is reasonable.
However, store owners refused to give back changes after I realised the money was not tally in my pocket. Paid $50, change $3.8.
Is my fault on not realise and inform store owner immediately. And what makes me frustrated was the store owners not willing to resolve this together and keep blaming me on “messing with their cash”.
Well, lesson learned with a chicken chop rice that cost me around $46.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108014719648189723195/reviews
Wai Keat Chong,4,"It's a budget western food within an industrial estate. The food is what you see on the menu. No frills.

The queue for this western food is usually long during lunch time, so be prepared to wait.

The food court is also packed, making it hard to locate seats.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109182883906783051248/reviews
