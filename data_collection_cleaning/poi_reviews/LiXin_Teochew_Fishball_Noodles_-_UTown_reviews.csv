Dylan Li,5,"I enjoyed visiting LiXin a few times this past sem, and the quality is very consistent. The fishballs are soft and tasty, with a light broth. The noodles have a nice texture and the sauce gives it a mild sweet chili flavour. The price is reasonable, and it has a nice interior and usually isn't too busy so it's a good place to dine-in once in a while.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227455027475284936/reviews

Tiramisooo Tiramisooo,4,"The fishball folks since 1968. üôå

Not kidding, the Lixin fishballs made using yellowtail fish are fresh and bouncy. Had mine with a bowl of bee hoon and mee drenched in lots of chilli sauce. üå∂Ô∏è So far so good, I‚Äôm taking my chilli tolerance to the next level.

yu xuan,4,"plant-based noodles (with alliums)
(options that i chose: mee pok, spicy, no ketchup, no spring onion)
glad to find a plant-based option in a fishball noodle restaurant and the taste is good too

there is green onion mixed in all the plant-based fishballs and i think they used shallot oil for the noodles

would be better if its alliums free for more vegetarian patrons",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103775306443777071309/reviews
Colette Tan,4,Fishball noodles are good. The fishcakes are very big and the fishballs are nice - not too bouncy and processed. On the pricey side - $7.60 for fishball beehoon soup with fishcake and her giao - but the portion is big. Quiet and empty on a Friday evening.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112297245669411174670/reviews
