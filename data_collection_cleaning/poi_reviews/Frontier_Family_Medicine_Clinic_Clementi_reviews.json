      "text": "I had a very disappointing experience at Frontier Family Medicine Clinic. While the doctor is undeniably professional, the overall service makes each visit unnecessarily stressful.\n\nFirst, the receptionist was extremely rude and unfriendly, making the check-in process unpleasant. The pharmacist was equally arrogant, and I was given medication with a short expiry date (less than nine months). On top of that, simply topping up medication requires an appointment, which is quite inconvenient.\n\nTrying to reach the clinic by phone is another nightmare. The line is often engaged, and when I do get through, the call either rings endlessly or gets cut off. It feels impossible to get proper assistance.\n\nThe only positive aspect was the nurses and lab assistants, who were kind and efficient. However, the overall experience was frustrating, and the poor service from other staff overshadows any positives. I hope the management takes these issues seriously and improves their service.",

      "text": "it was my first time to the clinic to see Dr Koh Tingyi,  a very sweet,  patient and nice lady.There were three nice and friendly nurses whom I had met. Sandy and Lina were very gentle when taking my blood tests as I was so fearful of pain. Knowing my fear, Susie talked to me and let me held her hand when I asked her to, to lessen my fear. A big thank you to the three kind ladies. Wai Kei and Syahirah were two of the counter staff. It was Syahirah's helpful and friendly attitude on day I called up to enquire about the clinic that prompted me to go there. Wai Kei was kind enough to do her best to book an appointment to suit my  timing. Well I had made a correct decision to go to The Frontier Family Medicine Clinic at Grandial Mall",
