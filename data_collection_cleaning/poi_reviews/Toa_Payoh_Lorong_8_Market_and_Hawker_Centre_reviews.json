Tian Tian carrot cake was average, a little salty and even sweet to me. Changi Village Hokkien mee was average also, the dry type. Wonâ€™t make a trip especially for a the dishes but ok for a normal lunch if happen to be in the area.",

      "text": "Toa Payoh Lorong 8 Hawker Centre is a fantastic spot with a great variety of affordable food.\n\nI always come here with my parents for the Teochew porridge, fruit juice, popiah, and Hokkien mee! Personally, I prefer the Teochew porridge stall with the orange plates, especially for their braised pork and chicken wings ; very homely and comforting. The other stall, however, offers better steamed fish and braised duck.\n\nItâ€™s a reliable and satisfying place for good hawker food!",
