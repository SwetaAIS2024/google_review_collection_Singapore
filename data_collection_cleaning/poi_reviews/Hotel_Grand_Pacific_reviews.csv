Bruce Woolcock,4,"During our  recent stop over of two days in Singapore, my husband and I enjoyed and great stay at the Grand Pacific Hotel.
After a long international flight, we  were impressed by the efficiency of the check in process and the friendly and knowledgeable assistance provided by Velu. With little time and much to see, he was outstanding  in advising and providing local knowledge to enhance our experience . We were very grateful.
The position of the hotel is excellent being central and close to the large Bogus shopping centre.
Rooms were spacious, clean and functional.
We would highly recommend  this hotel.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102481763462097565293/reviews
Zainabbas Ladha,3,"The chefs were pleasant and very friendly. The reception staff were welcoming. Not warm!
Overall: would not be a great place. It's next to the Bugis station which is great! And, little close to little India, 35 mins walk to marina bay and little china as well!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102421082510970309455/reviews
Sprite Prince,4,"Nice hotel
The hotel is located on Victoria Street, close to major landmarks such as the Merlion, Fort Canning, Marina Bay, and the shopping district on Orchard Road. It's very convenient for traveling by MRT or bus, with a bus stop right in front of the hotel.
The staff were nice, the room was clean and larger than those in other nearby hotels. The gym was a bit small for me, but the restaurant was excellent.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110483636181897613142/reviews
Hiang Ar,4,"The room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed. The furnishings in the bedroom were modern, with a comfortable bed, plenty of warm light, and a work desk. But the bathroom is more of an older design. The view is great, thereâ€™s 2 layers of windows.
The pool is compact and great. It is a 2m deep pool. Given the prime location, the value is extremely good.

The only issue I encountered during my stay was with the room key card. Despite my stay being valid, I had difficulty accessing the room, elevator, and gym.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101185220797498251612/reviews
Gabby P,5,"During our week long stay at Hotel Grand Pacific, my parents, young daughter, and I were thoroughly impressed by the exceptional service and convenient location.

One of the highlights of our stay was the outstanding assistance provided by Velu, a member of the hotel staff. Every day, Velu went above and beyond to ensure our comfort, assisting with taxi bookings and offering invaluable advice on sightseeing, shopping, and dining options. His friendly demeanor and extensive knowledge truly enhanced our experience. Additionally, Lyn at the check-in counter greeted us warmly and facilitated a smooth check-in.

The buffet breakfast was good, offering a wide choice of dishes that catered to all our tastes.  The guest rooms, were quite dated in decor, but were clean and comfortable and provided value for money (as the hotel was cheaper compared to others in the vicinity).

Overall, Hotel Grand Pacific provided a pleasant stay with excellent service, particularly from Velu, whose dedication made our visit memorable. We highly recommend this hotel for travelers seeking a centrally located accommodation with attentive staff and great value.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100253446056831838386/reviews
