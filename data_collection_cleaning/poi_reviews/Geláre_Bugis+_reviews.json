      "text": "Approached the staff whether they are still opened he said yes. Was around 8.40pm. Placed order for 2 sets of waffles with double scoop each, popcorn chicken, mac and cheese and a shake. The shake arrived first at 8.53pm. Minutes apart popcorn chicken then mac and cheese and the 2 sets of waffles with double scoop arrived at 8.58pm.\n\n9.05pm the other staff came to say they are closing soon. 9.13pm she came again to say they are close now. The total bill cost $80 over bucks. With the waffles arriving last you expect us to gobble up the waffles?\n\nThe operating hours states that bugis plus outlet are from 11.30am to 10pm. Appreciate if you can update your website and also educate your staff. Very unpleasant experience.",

Asked her if able to do takeaway, she looked at the cashier counter unwillingly and proceeded to sigh and took our takeaway order reluctantly. Very very bad experience.\n\nOtherwise, the ice cream is good, though very melted.",

      "text": "Gelare's ice cream selection is quite impressive, offering a wide range of delicious flavors to choose from. Whether you prefer classic options like vanilla and chocolate or more adventurous ones like mint fudge or blueberry cheesecake, Gelare has something for every ice cream lover. The quality and richness of their ice cream are truly satisfying.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the service at Gelare can be a bit sluggish. While the wait might be justified by the delicious ice cream, it's something to consider if you're in a hurry.\n\nAnother aspect to take into account is the ambiance. Gelare's location on the 5th floor of Bugis+ means it's generally quieter compared to some other dessert places in busier areas. This can be a positive if you're looking for a peaceful setting to enjoy your ice cream, but it's not the ideal choice if you're seeking a bustling, lively atmosphere.\n\nTo sum it up, Gelare provides excellent ice cream with a wide variety of flavors. Just be prepared for the possibility of slower service and a more tranquil atmosphere due to its location on the 5th floor of Bugis+.",
