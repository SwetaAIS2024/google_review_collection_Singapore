What really elevates the experience is the impressive selection of chili and sauces, ensuring there's something to please every palate. Oh, and don't leave without trying their fried chicken – it's absolutely delicious!",

The charcoal hotpot, the quality of the ingredient used, the most friendly staff, it all adds to the great experience. Expect that the costs are very reasonable, the staff always helpful and there a tonne of condiment like chilli, sesame oil etc that is on offer for you to make sauce.\n\nA must visit and eat for sure",
