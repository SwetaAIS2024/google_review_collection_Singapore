TF,5,"Love how they focus on local teas that don’t burn your wallet. Most of the drinks range from a dollar to two.

Got my usual teh c kosong. While the teh taste doesn’t come off strongly in the first few mouths, it comes through slowly with each sip. Teh is served piping hot, which I appreciate. Would definitely be back whenever I have the chance!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101085736491369105980/reviews
