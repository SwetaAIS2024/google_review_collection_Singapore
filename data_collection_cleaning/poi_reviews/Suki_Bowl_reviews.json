      "text": "Tucked inside Roxy Square Kopitiam, Suki Bowl SG is such a hidden gem for Thai food lovers! I tried the Thai glass noodles and the MAMA dry tomyum version — both were bursting with flavour and super comforting. The suki sauce is the real star here — perfectly sweet, salty, spicy and tangy, just like what you'd get in Thailand!\n\nStarting from just $5.50 (depending on your choice of proteins/ingredients), it's really value for money, and you can tell the team put effort into getting everything right — from the imported noodles to the generous ingredients.\n\nThis is actually by the same folks behind Siam Square Mookata & Running Egg, who literally spent 5 years perfecting this!\n\nA great spot if you're craving authentic Thai sukiyaki-style noodles without burning a hole in your wallet. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "Tried Suki Bowl at Roxy Square and was really impressed. Prices start from just $6.50, and you get to choose between mama noodles or dong fen as your base. I had the All-in-One and Powerhouse bowls, both flavourful and good.\nEverything is stir-fried with veggies, egg and your selected toppings, then tossed in their signature tangy sukiyaki sauce. You can go for dry or soup style too.Good for a quick, hearty and affordable meal. Will be back to try the other bowls!",
