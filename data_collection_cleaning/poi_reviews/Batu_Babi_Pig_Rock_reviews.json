A very long time ago, the trio challenged one another to a race to see who could swim to Pulau Ubin the fastest, under the condition that whomever failed to reach ashore by the strike of noon shall be cursed into stone. Unfortunately, none of them were successful and were thus petrified into boulders where they were— with the frog located off the coasts of Pulau Sekodok; the pig located off the beaches of Kampung Tanjung; and the elephant by the right banks of the mouth of Sungei Ubin.”",
