Tay Jason,4,Fairly large playground with elements for children to climb. Two swings which were slightly low. There was a mini excavator there for children to dig in the sand as well. Not much shade though.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102431085309418904749/reviews
Ramanan Raghuraman,4,"Nice playground with decent amenities. Good size for the neighborhood with open areas available to kick a ball or throw a frisbee, exercise area for older users and also has a covered event area.

Z D Y,3,"Generic playground with standard playground equipments. Good for normal play but nothing that will stimulate your child greatly. Good senior fitness facilities catered for the seniors living in this area.

Semi-outdoor pavilion space available for activities. Not as functional as the previous design that had a badminton court.

Overall, still well-kept and maintained. Good for 3gen family activities",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105106976080832093504/reviews
Chee Wee Wong,5,"Small playground but convenient for me. Kids love it. There is a small area with sand and a digger there. Also, there is a swing, which is becoming uncommon in playgrounds these days. Good to play for about half an hour at most. Playground is quite unique, with a see saw.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114031372832884721503/reviews
Jo L,5,"Clean area, child friendly, great place to hang around if you're a resident.

Only flaw is that your grab driver wouldn't know where to find you if you simply write ""Faber  Playground"" as a pickup point.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115792123775092035556/reviews
