I check in with the staff is my drinks on the Q as those behind me has already gotten theirs. Without eye contact the reply was many drinks. I ask another lady nicely she ask me go and sit first. When my cold drink is ready they still refuse to serve me my hot earl grey tea what a sequence. 3 staff at 9am please request for more people if you guys can’t manage. The beautiful weekend to start off with a cup of nice drinks is spoilt by your team.",
