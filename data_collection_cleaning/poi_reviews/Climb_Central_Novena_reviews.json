Such a fun day with the family trying rock climbing for the first time.\n\nThe staff there are very experienced and provide a good safety briefing with practice sessions to make sure you do it safely.\n\nCan get quite crowded later in the day.\n\nPrices are full day pass so you can come in and out. But they may stop entry if they are full house.",

The one on the 2nd level is for shorter course.\n\nThere's many lockers for you to put your belongings. There are also a bench near the counter for you to sit and take off your shoes.\n\nThey also have warming up area for you to stretch and do pull up and hang.\n\nIt's also well ventilated with big fans and aircon. It's clean and well maintained. Staff are friendly and helpful when we ask them to assist us in taking photos and also when we misplace certain items.\n\nAt the closing time, the staff did not rush us to leave and just waited patiently for us to finish packing and greet us politely when we left.\n\n#ILoveClimbCentralNovena",
