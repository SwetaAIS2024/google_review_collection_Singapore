The price is very reasonable and the dishes are great.\n\nDon't expect restaurant ambience but for hawker centre San Lou Hor Fan, uts outstanding. You can ask for their crispypork lard bits too.\n\nHighly recommended and will visit again.",

      "text": "Not able to decide which hor fun to try, I greedily ordered the option ‚Äúwith everything‚Äù - fish slices, beef slices, prawns. And added an extra egg.\n\nI knew I was in for a treat when I saw the giant licks of wok hey flames üî• üî•dwarfing even the cook himself and filling the entire kitchen.\n\nI also watched him cook each protein separately - fish slices, beef slices, prawns, and finally an egg droppped into sauce, and crunchy bean sprouts to finish.\n\nOf course it took longer to cook, but damb was it worth the wait. A smoky char is evident from your very first spoonful - permeating the sauce and the hor fun noodles. All 3 proteins were pitch perfect, with that juicy just-barely-cooked texture.\n\nWith extra egg, just $6.70. Simple food made exceedingly well, a total joy",
