Glenn Wong,3,"Regular Guardian outlet. Service of staff varies throughout due to changes in staffing. Compared to the Watson on level 2, this outlet is not as big and comprehensive in the range of items. But they do sell some products like some Korean skin care ones not sold in Watson. Sometimes you get special discounts depending on the current promotion. So do check with the staff time to time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111266038196750069636/reviews

Wei Ting Oh,1,"I would like to clarify that SAFRA reward vouchers can be used at Guardian outlets, as indicated on the SAFRA website. However, staff at Guardian Bugis Junction misinformed me, claiming the vouchers were not accepted at their outlet. If this outlet has specific restrictions, it should be clearly communicated, but if not, this misinformation reflects poorly on their service. I urge the management of this outlet at Bugis Junction to ensure their staff are well-informed and proactive in assisting customers. This experience left me questioning whether the issue was a lack of training or simply a lack of effort.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109315705449601499372/reviews
Merci,1,"The Indian cashier lady was rude as hell.
Was standing near the shelf waiting for my mom to finish her shopping and it wasn’t even crowded.

The cashier asked if I needed help and I said no.
With an attitude she told me, “don’t stand here then” then proceed to give me a look. I understand if I was disturbing or blocking anyone’s view. But I wasn’t lol.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103154431450914372151/reviews
