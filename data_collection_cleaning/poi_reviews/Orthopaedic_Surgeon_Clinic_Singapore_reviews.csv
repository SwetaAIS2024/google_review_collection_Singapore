Kah Nee Seow,5,"I had been suffering from pain in my heels for almost two years. It was diagnosed as Plantar Fasciitis by several doctors I have visited, and I have been through some treatments but the problem just won’t go away, so much so that I have to drop my usual exercises such as jogging or brisk walk. Then I was referred to Dr. Kevin Yip by a doctor friend. Dr Yip is such a friendly and patient doctor. He took the time to explain the cause of my foot issues in detail and what should I do and don’t, followed by an injection to each of my feet. He strongly advised me to do some physical therapy at home. After two weeks, the pain level dropped to about 50% of what I initially suffered. At the end of the fifth weeks it dropped further to about 25%. Now I am able to do my walk for 3km without much problem. I am very pleased to have this achievement, and very thankful to Dr Yip for his expertise and kindness.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105443334290705840039/reviews
