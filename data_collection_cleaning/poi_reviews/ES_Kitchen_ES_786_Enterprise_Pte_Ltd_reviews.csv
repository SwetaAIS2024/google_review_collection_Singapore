Jacqueline,5,"The satays here are flavourful and delicious! I think it's only available in the evening. Almost selling out when I was there around 7+pm. Highly recommend the chicken and mutton satays. Beef satays were a little lacking due to the absence of fats but that's just my personal preference. They have otah-otah, which they grill on the spot upon order and they are juicy and springy!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117874191110003037272/reviews
f a,2,"$4.00 laksa, using thick laksa instead of thick beehoon type laksa. The gravy was thick but only loaded with taugeh and fish cakes. No taupok.
The noodle was lumpy as they were rushing start at 820am.

They put sambal belacan on top without requested so you might want to tell them no sambal.

Disappointing laksa.

Maybe their nasi padang is better?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108197474271189843317/reviews
