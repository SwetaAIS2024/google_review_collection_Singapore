The prices were reasonable, and the food tasted good overall. Their lunch deals are also worth noting.\n\nOne dish that didn't quite hit the mark for me was the kimchi pork soup - the pork had a strange taste. Not sure what it was. The kimchi soup however was good and full of flavour",

      "text": "Un-gatekeeping this hidden gem so that more people can support this awesome Korean restaurant!\n\nLocation wise it‚Äôs a little out of the way but if you drive there‚Äôs a carpark next to it\n\nOnto the food:\n\nSundubu jiggae- first time seeing (half) crab in this dish, good amount of clams and tofu as well. Delicious and worth it for $15\n\nKorean fried chicken- got the platter of 10 with 5 different flavors. Good way to try the different variations! Found it comparable to the ones we had in Korea, personally liked the original and yangnyeom, while wife likes the soy and chilli. For $30++, this works out to be ~$3 per piece (that‚Äôs even cheaper than KFC)",

      "text": "What a gem nestled in this hidden corner in the south. Not many people know about it and we happen to walk past on our way to another nearby restaurant and decided to do a detour. Best decision of the evening. Amazing korean pancakes and fried chicken. Love that it's very quiet but I hope it gets more business here so it stays open. The food is just top quality stuff. Parking is easy at the Crimson building just right next door. Perfect place to do dinner with friends and family on a weekend!",
