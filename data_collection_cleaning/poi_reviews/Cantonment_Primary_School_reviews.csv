evelyn lim,4,Thank you for the amazing experience you gave me in my school years. I appreciate your efforts in teaching me even if I caused quite a bit of trouble. I heard that there is now a construction to a shelter over the basketball court. Good luck :),2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103300003078145441693/reviews
Ziqin Lim,3,"School Review

The students at this school are absolutely amazimg, friendly, hardworking, and full of talent. They make the environment vibrant and enjoyable, creating a sense of camaraderie that's hard to find elsewhere. However, the teaching staff is a mixed bag. While some teachers are inspiring and dedicated, others can be dismissive, unapproachable, and downright unpleasant, which detracts from the overall learning experience.Another major drawback is the state of the toilets. It's almost impossible to step into them without being overwhelmed by the smell. Many toilets are often found with unflushed waste or dirty floors, which is both unhygienic and an embarrassment for a school of this caliber.In summary, the school has incredible students and great potential, but it seriously needs to address its teacher dynamics and sanitation issues.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106634847583049549761/reviews
aiden,3,"amazing school but the toilets are dirty and the sinks are always full of stuff, no hate tho. im sure all toilets are like that. the canteens food is not the best. always raising the prices. imagine a bowl of ramen for 2.50 and it isn't even that nice. bring your own food.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107334268022732542435/reviews
Mei Ling Lee,5,"This is an amazing school. My son is studying there. The teachers and principal, Mrs Mano are so patient and kind. Mrs Mano will stand at the gate and greet the kids most  mornings and I saw her holding an umbrella sheltering the kids from rain. It is like a local international school. My son has friends from all over the world.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103488258233696125543/reviews
Jayden Tham Zhan Ming,3,"Cantonment Primary: Aight, Not Bad

So, I went to this school, Cantonment Primary, and it was... okay, I guess. Like, it wasn't the worst, but it wasn't the best either. You know what I mean?

The teachers were cool. Some were funny, some were strict, but they were all pretty chill. The classes were kinda boring sometimes, but there were a few fun projects and field trips. And the canteen food... let's just say I didn't starve, but it wasn't exactly a feast either.

The school grounds were nice, though. Lots of trees and open spaces to run around. And the location was pretty convenient, so getting to and from school wasn't a hassle.

Overall, Cantonment Primary was just... average. If you're looking for a good school, it's definitely worth checking out. But if you're expecting something amazing, you might be disappointed.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101719028986034584656/reviews
