Sten (Piqued Wanderer),5,"Great place to have a short jog or walk and yet be able to enjoy the sunlight while u have ur routine.

This location is one of the long exercise park instead of a big park. One of the unique parks we have seen around. For a unique park like this, this will be a good place to work on static exercises. You can your journey starting from the underpass, have a warming up walk towards d end of park and plan your exercise work out. Once you reach the open area of the machines available or just the sitting area, you can start exercising.

It is a good way to work out and yet use the timing to ur own benefit. Body weight exercises are always in trend no matter when n where. U can then restart or end the exercise routine by walking pass the lush flowers and leaves brushing past by u.

If u get d right timing, this place is definitely a lovely place to work out with ur love ones.. Check the timing out urself üòÅ

Ruth LX,3,"Tiny and functional, very pretty and green, well-kept... but comes with the great drawback of being situated right next to a busy, noisy, polluted highway. The air is smoggy (even late at night), and we wouldn't bring our kids or furkid here if given a choice.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106129553699361217525/reviews
