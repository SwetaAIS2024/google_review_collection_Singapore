Kah Wang Tan,4,"Got the peanut butter toast set and itâ€™s not too bad. Will be nice if the butter is cold. The coffee is not too bad as well, and the queue moves quite fast!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117624172714283499367/reviews
Chen Family,4,"This stall in the middle row offers coffee and whole meal Kaya toast. Although it sounds like an oxymoron.. healthy Kaya toast?!! It turned out quite nice.. standard toast thickness but quite crisp, with lashings of butter and Kaya. Ask for less fillings, if you really want to be healthy ðŸ˜€. Coffee wasnâ€™t too bad, if not quite as good as You and Me coffee. I notice lots of wholemeal sandwich options also, at very reasonable prices. Service was friendly and efficient.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118145836301674418853/reviews
Supreet Kini,5,"Try and patronise this stall when in the area. Long queue at breakfast time, but fast moving.

Loads of sandwich and toast options. Hard working uncle and aunty manning the stall.

Recently had their gula Melaka Kopi. It was excellent and not overly sweet.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105328280516267995599/reviews
