Base too much condensed milk (3/5)\n\n- roasted oolong milk tea\nOrdinary (3/5)\n- green tea latte\nOrdinary (3/5)\n\nService not so friendly especially the cashier staff. I actually ordered less sweet for all drinks but one of my drinks are regular sweet.",

Today, the staff finally attended to me, and I'd like to give a special mention to Bella, who was very friendly and attentive. She truly made my experience enjoyable. Compared to yesterday, when the staff seemed rather ignorant and slow, today's service was a pleasant surprise. Good job! I hope you maintain this level of service moving forward, as it would really make a big difference in keeping customers happy and loyal.",
