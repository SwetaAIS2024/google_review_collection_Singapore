Jonathan Lum,4,"We arrived at the restaurant early on Sunday evening to celebrate my daughter's birthday. It was not very crowded and we managed to find a comfortable cosy corner.

The staff were friendly and nice. I preferred the Salad Bar Buffet especially the Salad Potato, Coleslaw & Muffins. We also ordered 2 Chargrilled Chicken (tender but not so tasty) with Baked Potato and a Grilled Fish mixed with Herbs & French Fries.

Overall it was an affordable buffet dinner that filled our hungry stomachs to the brim.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104876861680092312539/reviews
Avis Wong,5,"Didn’t know that Aston’s have a branch with salad bar buffet. It was tucked in a far corner, probably where Marks & Spencer.

It was value for money. The salad and cooked food bar was extensive and we enthusiastically took so much, which we finished anyway. There was also hot and cold drinks option and ice cream.

The service staff was excellent. I accidentally spilled my bowl of mushroom soup as it was hot. The staff helped me scoop a new bowl of soup and was also very patient with cleaning up my mess.

Would keep in this place in mind when I want a value meal in town.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114733312008361940225/reviews
Wendy Seah,4,"Took set lunch with free flow of salad bar, soft drink & ice cream. Prices subject to service charge and GST.

Our chicken chop were done crispy and nicely charred. Service staff were friendly and always with a smile when serving or clearing our plates.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101617481201392872573/reviews
M Mixue,4,"Good salad and hot side dishes variety, which has remained same standard for many years. Soup not so tasty. Grilled fish was kinda dry.

We prefer grilled chicken. Despite restaurant being less than half filled, staff didn't clear our empty plates and we had to put them to the empty table next to ours.

It will be good to have 1 or 2 seasonal dishes to spice up their buffet bar variety.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101525532069894321675/reviews
Zech L,2,"Can afford to cover some of the food especially those condiments.

Food replenished regularly. Wide selection of greens for salad. However, mushroom and cauliflower soup too starchy while the clear soup is tasteless.

Ordered chargrilled chicken and was rather salty, the lemon lime chicken sauce was normal and honestly, expecting a little bit more quality in terms of their sauce.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102503263909065125475/reviews
