HãpPŸ,5,"This stall not only served shui kueh, they have chu cheong fun, fried carrot cake, soon kueh as well. Other condiments on sale like the chilli and dried sambal prawn aka hei bi hiam on sale in a bottle too. Will come back again to try other other items. Auntie is very friendly. Parking is available at the multi storey  beside this coffee shop.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100738228560182078848/reviews
c k,5,"Finally I get to try an old time favorite. The rice cake is smooth but not overly firm like other as it has a soft texture to it. Raddish has the right balance of flavour and crunchiness. Though I ask for extra chilli but was only given a small amount....guess the staff must have been instructed to control the amount no matter what customer's request.
5 pieces for $3.50",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109267742470551629564/reviews
Angelia Yang,1,Jian Bo has been my favourite shui kueh in Singapore and I was so happy to find an outlet in Bt Panjang. Unfortunately this happy experience was hampered by a very very rude serving staff this morning. It was like the customer had to beg her for everything  !!! It really spoiled the mood for a nice traditional breakfast. I definitely won't go back to Jian Bo.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105037776828182087300/reviews
David Oon,5,"Jian Bo is still the best Shui Kueh in SG, IMHO. Soft silky rice cakes, with a oohlala savoury, tangy, crunchy turnip garnish, and when mixed with the spicy chilli, never fails to give me that Ratatouille moment. Pair that with a hot cup of Kopi-O, wow... Heaven is on earth! Have been patronising the stall for a while, and service is ok. Just upgrade that with a smile and a hearty ""ni hau"".",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111461636018977333111/reviews
R L,4,"A little difficult to notice since the stall sells many other things. Would say that overall quality is 90% similar to what you get at tiong bahru. Chilli is great, turnip is generous and not overly sweet. Just wayyyyyyy too much oil in the packet!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114551521595925199520/reviews
