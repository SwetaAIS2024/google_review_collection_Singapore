Nic,3,"isteaks main selling pt is its affordability but it is no longer as cheap as it used to be (thank goodness for grab dine out discounts)

the uruguay ribeye ($39 before discount) was a bit too lean and tough for my liking, as expected since grass fed, but the rest of the steaks (grain and corn) were out of budget lol wasn't gg to spend north of $50 for a fast food chain steak (but at least the food was indeed served fast)

staff recommendation for sides were good tho - candied pumpkin and egg plant were chefs kiss! altho i usually go for more pedestrian options like fries and mac cheese which i feel go better w a steak hehe

Perseon Aluse,5,Thank you to server JX for a good experience. They were attentive and pointed out certain discounts they had. Was also very patient during payment difficulties. The place is relatively dark with spotlight lighting but the food is good. Worth it,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102329987294255368283/reviews
Roland Chan,4,"Really liked the service when we visited the branch tonight. Christina Teh served us warmly and shared a lot of details on the different steaks that they offer there when we requested, and can feel her passion - thank you!

The beef steaks are not bad for the price point. Nothing phenomenal, but definitely able to satisfy your craving when you need a steak!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113128925482802432756/reviews
Ivan Teh,5,"Lamb Chop (SGD $43) @ iSteaks Diner.
.
This casual dining brand has come a long way, since its humble beginnings as a coffeeshop stall in February 2008, now rivaling other premium steakhouse restaurants.
.
Their lamb t-bone cut commands a premium, chargrilled till a perfect medium well doneness. Succulent crunchy juicy with smoky fatty meaty salty savoury flavour.
.
The side of grilled garlic butter eggplant is tender soft with smoky buttery vegetal sweet spice flavour, addictive.
.
The side of crunchy chilled potato salad is delightful with starchy sweet savoury earthy flavour.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114332345573544911646/reviews

Visited Isteak at JEM this afternoon.  Compliments to the chef again.  We had chargrill ribeye and striploin.  Both steaks were done beautifully with the sides we loved. Today i tried their coffee at promotion rate of SGD1.  Nice coffee.. worth drinking!

Great food. Our steaks and pork T-bone were done just right. Always happy with their sides. Delicious!!
The lady server on duty, forgot to ask for her name, probably in her 50's, was very helpful and attentive. We changed to a bigger table as my mum came in with wheelchair and needed a bigger space. She will also check that my mum was properly seated and assisted us when my mum was leaving the restaurant. üëç
The lighting here was a little too dim for us though. ü§≠
A great lunch...thanks chef. Btw, i felt that the food seems better at this branch.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105052490586738746635/reviews
