Anh Tu,5,"My family had lunch at KFC GR today. Overall, the store was quite spacious and clean. The service was quite good our meal  still very hot, and the chicken was tender and juicy. My son really enjoyed the Original Recipe (OR) chicken here. We will definitely come back again someday!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116077483586211573257/reviews
Tiramisooo Tiramisooo,4,"Craving for junk food. 🍔🍟🍗

I asked my foodie clan for recommendations and they told me to eat KFC Samyang Budak Chicken.

I listened. I ate. I perspired. 😅

“This sauce is spicy one ah,” warned the kind KFC auntie staff. She must’ve seen my mala xiaola face since I stepped into the queue. My verdict? It’s shiok but 🌶️🌶️🌶️. The kimchi coleslaw is brilliant tho! 👍

jung woo,1,"Very disappointing experience at this KFC outlet for takeout. Despite there being fewer than five people in the store, I waited nearly half an hour for my breakfast order. The staff preparing the food seemed disorganized, repeatedly walking back and forth causing more delays. I only ordered two meals, it took such long time for the second order to be done. By the time the second meal was ready, the first order had already gone cold. The food quality was way below expectation, both orders were prepared sloppily. Save your time and dine at a different KFC outlet.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109740575495843855514/reviews
