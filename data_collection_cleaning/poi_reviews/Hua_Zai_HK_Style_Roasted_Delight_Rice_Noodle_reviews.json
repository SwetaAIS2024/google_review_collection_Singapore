It not only value for money but dirt cheap. Char Siew is one dish that is a must have dish. Except for the noddles every beats and pieces of the food are prepared at the the stall. After 10am, the food are still cheap and good. A set of ¬Ω chicken with vegetables, 2 bowls of rice and wanton soup cost $8.80 only. So many other areas to tell you but best to visit the stall to find out more. I assure you that you won't regret visiting this stall.",
