My wife had ramen (forgot which one!), but she said it was good. A nice bonus: they offer free eggs! Overall, a decent place for a quick and tasty meal.",

As it was my birthday Month, I paid only $11+ for this table of food.\n\nSmall but fit shop for a ramen gathering. I ordered the Karamiso ramen for $13.80+. After GST and Svc charge it became $16+.\n\nThe best is the chashu which gave me a wow! factor. Will come back if craving ramen again.",

Price was average pricing expected for a neighbourhood shopping mall. After all it was acceptable , but there are better ramen shop taste better with pricing near.",
