      "text": "Ordered the Boneless Chicken Sambal Taliwang ($6.50) for jasmine rice. Additional $0.50 if coconut rice.\n\nThe Sambal is the main star, holding the dish together. Portion and offerings are normal in any penyet store. Soup was nice, tauhu and tempeh were also great.\n\nThe sambal had a slight kick, had a nutty essence to it. Only drawback was that the boneless chicken had more of a flaky breast meat texture, which did not really hit that hard with the sambal. Its decent, I wouldn't say its anything out of the ordinary.",
