Jose Tan,1,"I had a disappointing experience with Dr. Seow Choen. Despite his many years of experience and assuring me that the success rate of my procedure would be 98%, I experienced complications after my pile surgery. When I returned for a follow-up, I was advised to undergo a second surgery to address the issue. Furthermore, upon learning that I was claiming through my company insurance, he proceeded to charge me for the second procedure. This experience has left me extremely dissatisfied, and I would strongly advise anyone considering pile surgery to explore other options.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100774534720640432407/reviews

Nick Teo,5,"Thank you Dr. Seow and her team of nurses, especially Christine for arranging for my colonoscopy procedure.
As this is my first time going through a procedure, naturally, I will be afraid! The assurance from their professionalism, eases off all anxiety.
The best is that the results were fast and they are all good!
Thank you once again for this God sent team!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111176052001039048453/reviews
Reinvented To Be Still,5,"For a specialist in private practice Dr Seow-Choen is unpretentious and down to earth. No airs. He doesn't rush you if you need more insights into your problem. He puts us at ease about the procedures. My husband was discharged within 24 hours of surgery. And we returned a week later for review. Highly recommended and a go-to doctor. Don't let the clinic location fool you.
Dr. Seow-Choen YOU ARE GOD SEND. And a big thank you.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104326035669045443466/reviews
julie goode,5,Dr Seow-Choen is excellent and an educator. He explains everything well to his patients and I learned more about my colon health than I have in previous 15 years watching over my colon after my sister died from colon cancer very young. Office staff is excellent as well. I cannot recommend Dr Seow-Choen and his staff more highly!!!,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117270895936258085513/reviews
