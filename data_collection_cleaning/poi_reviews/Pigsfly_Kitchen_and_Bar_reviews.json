      "text": "Bad choice when there are a few other Thai food choices nearby. Tried the pineapple fried rice years ago and it was definitely better back then, hence we thought to give this place a try when we were nearby. What a shame.\n\nThe beef noodles were totally bland,  and beef slices were hard and dry. We didn't finish it not because we were full, but really didn't enjoy it at all.  The crispy omelette was oily and a little too salty. We had to go elsewhere for a cup of Chinese tea to feel better after the meal. Would have prefer they separate the coconut milk from the mango and sticky rice instead of soaking them in the coconut milk.\n\nPortions were big but considering the price and taste, it is definitely one of the worst Thai food we ever had.\n\nService was attentive. But I guess we need good food to be returning customers.",

Reasonably priced for that area and most of their full time wait staff are quite attentive and friendly.\nOn weekends, when it gets busy, service standards might drop a bit.\nThey also serve Thai and North Indian cuisine.",
