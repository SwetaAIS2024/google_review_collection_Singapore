It was not very crowded and we managed to find a comfortable cosy corner.\n\nThe staff were friendly and nice. I preferred the Salad Bar Buffet especially the Salad Potato, Coleslaw & Muffins. We also ordered 2 Chargrilled Chicken (tender but not so tasty) with Baked Potato and a Grilled Fish mixed with Herbs & French Fries.\n\nOverall it was an affordable buffet dinner that filled our hungry stomachs to the brim.",

      "text": "Didn’t know that Aston’s have a branch with salad bar buffet. It was tucked in a far corner, probably where Marks & Spencer.\n\nIt was value for money. The salad and cooked food bar was extensive and we enthusiastically took so much, which we finished anyway. There was also hot and cold drinks option and ice cream.\n\nThe service staff was excellent. I accidentally spilled my bowl of mushroom soup as it was hot. The staff helped me scoop a new bowl of soup and was also very patient with cleaning up my mess.\n\nWould keep in this place in mind when I want a value meal in town.",

Despite restaurant being less than half filled, staff didn't clear our empty plates and we had to put them to the empty table next to ours.\n\nIt will be good to have 1 or 2 seasonal dishes to spice up their buffet bar variety.",

However, mushroom and cauliflower soup too starchy while the clear soup is tasteless.\n\nOrdered chargrilled chicken and was rather salty, the lemon lime chicken sauce was normal and honestly, expecting a little bit more quality in terms of their sauce.",
