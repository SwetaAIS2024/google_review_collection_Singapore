      "text": "Visited Wingstop for the first time and ordered over at the counter. The staff were patient and friendly which made the experience enjoyable. I decided to try their Irvins Salted Egg boneless wings. While I was unsure about which dip to choose, the staff recommended their popular ranch dip, so I decided to give it a go.\n\nThe boneless wings were incredibly fresh and tender, with the salted egg flavor perfectly balanced, making each bite (without any dip) so flavorful that it left me craving more. The fries were also well-seasoned too.\n\nIt would be great if the salted egg flavor became a regular menu item! Next time, I’m looking forward to try the cheese dip and mushroom fritters as well.",

      "text": "Tried five boneless chicken flavors: Louisiana Rub, Garlic Parmesan, Irvin Salted Egg, Mango Habanero, and Teriyaki. My favourite was Louisiana Rub, a dry rub with cayenne pepper and garlic that was very nice. The Mango Habanero came second, being moist and flavourful. The limited-time Irvin Salted Egg flavor was also enjoyable. However, i found the Teriyaki flavor not nice and “very jelak,” while the Garlic Parmesan was too mild.\n\nAlso enjoyed the Voodoo Fries, loaded with cheese sauce and powder, and the Cajun Fries. Highly recommend ordering the ranch sauce in a big size to dip the entire chicken in the cold sauce, which was delicious.\n\nHowever, i found the service to be super slow. Even when it’s not crowded, often have to wait a very long time because they prioritize Grab orders over dine-in customers. When the place is crowded, the wait time for dine-in can be as long as 1-2 hours, which I find unacceptable. I feel that Wingstop should improve their service to better accommodate both dine-in and delivery customers.",

This time on top of the long waiting hours (even though the store had barely anyone and the staff were chatting away not serving any of the in-store customers ) , the food they gave was underwhelming. The chicken was so small and didn’t taste like the usual chicken I eat from other locations",

Saw many food delivery orders so waiting time is much longer.\n\nNoticed that their wings got were so much smaller but taste was as good as before especially their buffalo wings, Louisiana rub and lemon & pepper flavours. I love their fries and mushroom fritters too. Both matched the ranch sauce so well. Craving satisfied for the day.",
