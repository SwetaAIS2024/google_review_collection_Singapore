Sean Goh,4,"First time trying the zhichar. Prior to this, we  frequent the previous stall as they offered alot of value for money dishes. Reached the place around 8pm and surprised that the place was pretty empty.  Quick browse on the menu, quite extensive and they have set meals available. Ordered 5 dishes, 2 veg, 1 squid, 1 egg and chicken.

Food didnt took long to be ready. Portion was relatively huge. Enjoyed the food but the outstanding dish for me has to be that chicken dish.

Overall, food seems not bad and will likely to be back to dine again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Laura Laura,5,"This place is a hidden gem. We ordered sambal salted fish fried rice, seafood hor fun and hotplate tofu. One of the best fried rice I had ever eaten. The hotplate tofu is also very delicious. Will definitely come back to try other dishes.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112732845384803624584/reviews
