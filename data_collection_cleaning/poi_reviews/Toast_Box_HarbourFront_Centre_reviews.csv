Flo G,4,"What set this Toast Box outlet from the rest is the sea view - if you can score a window seat. Totally worth it.

Located on level 2, a little hidden next to the cruise boarding area this Toast Box outlet is always crowded. Although the crowds disperse quickly if they are catching the Batam ferries.

The eggs and toast are well executed here, making $6.20 traditional toast set worth while.

I have been here several weekend mornings and manage to get a window side sea view table, enjoying my breakfast with a view.

Service is always cordial with the staff here.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews
Titan Pua,5,"We're breakfast there before go Batam. We waiting for our ferry and take opportunity to eat breakfast there. Hard to find because blocked by long queue of people. Food not bad, seats very closed to each others.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105126799522947612860/reviews
Chiara S,4,"Iâ€™d give it a 3.5 stars but the view deserves a bit more.

Coffee and tea are standard and around $1.8 and kaya toast ($1.9) is pretty good - staff is friendly and this branch seems quieter than others since it is tucked away in a corner of Harbourfront mall.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108550814308737141921/reviews
John Little,5,"5 Stars for the view. While the menu is the same as the rest of the outlets, this HarbourFront outlet offers the sea view; From the full height glass, you get to watch ferries arriving and leaving the jetties and also a good view of Sentosa some distance away, while dining and waiting for your boarding time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114237691954575144213/reviews
