Vivian Tsang,2,"The plaza itself is conveniently  located and there  is a good spread of retails.
The only drawback is the 2  lifts, which break down almost every month. Sometimes both lifts break down at the same time !  That becomes very inconvenient for the shoppers with heavy trolleys (and with young children in tow) & wheelchair users.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103919911708573583676/reviews
Kuan Khoon Tan,4,"Pretty much the same place as what I remember when I was young until now (30+ years and counting).

Of course many shops have come and gone including my optician who retired a few years back. Overall, good shop mix, more to eat, more hipster cafes and food joints.

Pop by and have a go yourself.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104155905354945520105/reviews
LuxiaSych,5,"Visited after a long time, nice additions of Yakun, JiDeChi, Otter Pizza & more. Mall could do with better advertising of shops. Also, the mall music selection could be better. ðŸ˜…",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109443692244012218693/reviews
YY,1,"Never liked it here. The mall doesn't bother putting benches outside tuition centers for parents waiting for kids. It's as if they don't want you to spend time there. Anyway in most shops I encountered staff with stuck-up attitude, so no point supporting them. The lifts are very slow and always break down. No fast food outlets other than subway. Poor connectivity to other amenities in the area if you walk. Parking is expensive with only 1$ rebate if you shop >50$ in fairprice. The only good thing is the big and comprehensive fairprice finest, but I would rather go to the one in Bukit Panjang Plaza or Hillion mall.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106073706256890437936/reviews
Jay S,5,"This mall is old! But itâ€™s trying really hard to keep up with the time. Your can see sheâ€™s nicely renovated. Doesnâ€™t give out the 80s vibe. Little crowd at night, shops are closed.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103783445153793643024/reviews
