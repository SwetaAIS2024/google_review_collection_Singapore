The fizzy lemonade was refreshing. The tuna sandwich had a moderate amount of tuna - so good overall.\n\nEnvironment is peaceful with warm sunlight (place is air-conditioned). Very comfortable. Seats are nicely spaced so it doesnâ€™t feel crowded. Staff are friendly and patient.",

Nice piped-in music amidst a cosy setting on the ground level of  Harbourfront Tower One next to FDC Family Dental Clinic.\n\nUnfortunately,today,28/6/23,is their last day in business till 14h00 so drop by to grab your coffee(they offer 1 for 1 today!)",

The place is clean, air-conditioned. The seat at the corner has power sockets available below.\nIt's sadly empty on Friday 1:45pm. The folks probably hadn't advertised it enough.",
