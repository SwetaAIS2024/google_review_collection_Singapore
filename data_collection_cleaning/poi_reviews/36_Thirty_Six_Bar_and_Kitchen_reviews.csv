Clair Lo,5,"Place to chill & hangout for a couples of drink. Only $28+ for 2 hours drink buffet. Cocktail a bit too sweet for me, I go for whiskey on the rock, never go wrong ☺️

Fried chicken wings is good. Fish & chips a bit over cooked.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103993936532275440061/reviews
Ziling Zeng,5,Free flow alcohol is really worth it if you can drink. Cocktails are all citrus flavor which I am a bit tired of. I prefer vodka and whiskey on the rock. Chicken wings are very nice.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102076387804044773766/reviews
Loh Soon Shan,5,"A hidden gem in the neighborhood! Cozy ambiance with a well-curated selection of drinks—not extensive, but just right. The food is a standout, especially the fresh seasonal oysters, succulent lobster roll, and perfectly grilled beef skewers. The tako wasabi was a unique surprise! Great spot for a relaxed night out with friends or family. Will definitely be back!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114194136783291087444/reviews
Victoria Tho,5,Liquid buffet very worth it if you can drink. $49++ for 4hours at this point. Enough options to choose from. Alice and other staff have been very nice. Food wise actually surprisingly good. Bites maybe just so so but good enough to get through the night. Overall good!,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115283041754266259938/reviews
