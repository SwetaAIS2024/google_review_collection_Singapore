sundaypig tomlim,5,"We queue for 1.5 hours on a Friday evening, we started queuing at 6pm.
Do the math.
It is worth the time and the experience.
The fish slices were thick and fresh, with abundant vegetables on the side. The Tom yum broth wasn’t the best to be frank, the herbal soup is better.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107543637150678582635/reviews
AC Chan,4,"This individual pot of soup with single serving of ingredients works best to satisfy steamboat cravings for sickly individual [like myself who is constantly down with a runny nose] especially during this year-end rainy season and at the same time, avoid having to share a hotpot meal with my family. Priced at $5.50 only, each set comes with a choice of meat (e.g. fish, beef, chicken, pork), vegetables, sliced fishballs/crab sticks, an egg and an individual pot of soup of my choice (e.g. chicken soup, mala soup, tom yam soup, herbal soup).",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
c shaoning,5,"Loved the herbal soup flavours - it's on the sweeter side but it's up my alley, uncle also gives a lot of ingredients for the price we are paying, so I definitely will be a returning customer! Waiting time is a bit long, but given that it's just one uncle manning the shop, I can understand it. Saw quite a few customers just ""self-servicing"" where possible to speed up the process (e.g. taking their own extra bowls and cutlery from the racks). Will come back when I have some extra time on hand.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110887877829118385604/reviews
Charlotte Lai,4,"Delicious hotpot ranging from $6 to $7.50. Choose from the pork, chicken, beef, prawn, fish, or mutton set meals. Soup bases are chicken, mala, tom yum, or herbal.

The portions are generous and flavourful so it's definitely worth for money! Huge downside is the long queue - I queued for 1 hour on weekend. It's also a one-man store operation, really wish there was a way to speed up the operations.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107503523093672951975/reviews
Joanna Lee,1,"Took us 50 mins to get our food. Tbh, the food was average even though the price is pretty affordable. $6 per set meal (without rice) is good price. However the seller’s attitude is bad, he refused to provide us an extra bowl to dine even though we ordered two set meals together with side dishes. Will I come back? Probably not due to slow and unfriendly service.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108000006355296907725/reviews
