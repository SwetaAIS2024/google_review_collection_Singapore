Jean Seah,4,Imaginative playground and extensive exercise equipment. But the insides of some of the playground tunnels are rusty or accumulated some sort of dirt.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108632468091770555906/reviews
Ravina S,2,Not well kept as I would have expected especially since this area has a lot of elderly moving around. I brought my 2 boys to play and felt so sick of the dirt and rubbish that was lying around. I did see a Town Council worker sweeping at one side but felt that the playground hasn't been maintained for a long time. Giving a fancy name as sensory park is just not enough. Do maintain it.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118387801871850799456/reviews
Emma Patience,5,"Good place to take a stroll, exercise and bring your family along! There are facilities for everyone of all ages. So take not there isn't a public toilet in the park but at the nearest hawker centre nearby.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104837974473549718087/reviews
Cassidy Chew,4,Quite a serene place though surrounded by HDB blocks.  It has it's own characteristics such as the echo pieces and tall bamboo trees.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114136979141574665107/reviews
Alan Phang,3,"It is a good place for people to relax and for children to explore. It has plenty of shade to keep away from the heat during a hot sunny day. However, the park needs an upkeep and maintenance to keep it clean and pleasant.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106623881552075609527/reviews
