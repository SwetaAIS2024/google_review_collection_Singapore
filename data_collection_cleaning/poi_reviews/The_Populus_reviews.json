      "text": "This restaurant is near my home and I've always seen a crowd outside waiting to get in. Finally I decided to try it with my GF this weekend. Making the reservation is easy on Chope and their slots are quite readily available.\n\nWe had too much meat for dinner the night before so we decided to go \"light\". My GF had the Avocado Superfood Green Platter and I went for the Populus Scramble. The Green platter has a piece of toast (quite a big one) spread with avocado slices and avocado puree topped with a variety of greens and feta cheese. The actual plate is much bigger than that on the photo. The Populus Scramble eggs is heavenly.\n\nWe enjoyed the food a lot. The atmosphere.. well it's crowded and noisy. We were seated on the ground floor next to the counter, they have seating on the second floor as well. Not sure how that is.\n\nWhen we were received at the door, we were told that there is a dinning time limited of 75-mins! So that's 1 hour and 15 mins? Hmm... not sure if they really enforce this. In my opinion 90-mins is acceptable.\n\nI may circle back to them again but there were just too many brunch places around that area.",

The beverage list also offers a wide variety of coffee, tea and soft drinks. A nice place to meet friends or for couples to hang out though it was really crowded during Saturday lunch time. It is not hard to see why it is so popular",

Crispy fish with a flaky and moist inside, with a refreshing and zesty soba - an amazing mouthwatering contrast.\n\nGood creamy 6oz white with a double shot in each cup of their coffees! It was rich in taste with a full bodied taste profile. Their chocolate (original dark 70%) was rich as well!\n\nAtmosphere was nice with a fair amount of seating with a modern industrial chic vibe.",

Overall I think the food quality is still good but maybe slightly lack the modern taste of the recent new cafes. But still a good eat nonetheless.",
