Skye Cai,5,"Nice traditional sponge cake.
It’s not that sweet and it’s great.
Tried the double flavours.
The cheese is with two layers of cheddar cheese at the bottom.
On top is the sponge cake.
The original is very soft and not too sweet too.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews

Grace Ong,1,"We bought one pack of castellan cake on last Sat afternoon between 3 pm to 5 pm for Sun breakfast.

The taste of the cake is not fresh as before. It could be unsold cakes for a certain duration. However we proceed to take as it's not spoilt.

However,  today we take a few more pieces and realized the taste is not right. We conclude the castella cake could have been unsold for few days or other reasons that result it's taste being not good.

Thus, we truly hope the management could look into maintaining freshness of the cakes.

In terms of customer services, it's generally ok. The cashier attending to us is polite. However there is another female staff who ignored us and turned her head away even when we said thank you.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102048290897156296043/reviews
CV,5,"Had tried their cakes before. This time tried their kuehs. Despite getting them in the evening,they still taste fresh and soft, not too sweet. The Ang ku kueh is a must buy. Better than some famous brands.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108806756909499687830/reviews
