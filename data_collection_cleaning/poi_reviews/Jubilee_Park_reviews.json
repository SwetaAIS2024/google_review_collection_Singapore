I passed this way when I go to Tiong Bahru to have my lunch.\n\nActually, this park is quite bigger than I thought, since there was some amusement media that I didnâ€™t capture. But, when I saw in google, I found it interesting.\n\nSo, in this area, you can play with kids, running, walking, or just enjoy the moment.\n\nYou can have free water here from the fountains right here.",

It's a great place to walk, take photos, play with kids, Very good choice! I like the environment and enjoy it. But if visit on the night, you should bring some friends, not only you.",

      "text": "First time checking out this park. Beautiful spacious surroundings with a small public car park next to it.\nA fun wooden obstacle course greets us as we walk toward thr park from the car park. Next to it there are a couple of inclusive swing (for the kids who are wheelchair bound) Nice!! And there are about another 5 swings just round the corner.\nFurther up, there are 5 different slides for the kids to play on. Spotted two sets of see-saw under a partially shaded area.\nIn case you run out of water, we spotted two re-filling stations around the park. There is even taps for the little ones to wash their hands and feet after playing on the sand.\nAnd if u are hungry after all the chasing and playing, Tiong Bahru Bakery is just nearby. Follow the aromatic smell of bread & coffee. ðŸ˜‰\nNote: Do come earlier in the morning as it can gets hot by 1030am.",

As I usually visit here for some events like â€œFilms at the Fort â€œand some concerts in previous years. Loved the big seesaw, slides and the climbing net. Iâ€™m always grateful for the amazing parks of Singapore which offer loads of fun for both kids and adults. And itâ€™s FREE!!! Definitely will come back here. And kudos to the staff and volunteers for keeping the park clean and in good condition as always.",
