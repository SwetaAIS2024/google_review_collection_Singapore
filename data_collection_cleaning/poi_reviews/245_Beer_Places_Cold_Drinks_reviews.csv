Loo San,4,"Big cups of sugar cane juice with lemon for S$3.50. Very refreshing after a long bicycle ride in the tropical heat

Unfortunately the published location for this review is not accurate because google maps is not able to granularly define the unique block shapes for HDB (Government public housing) apartments. This creates a problem in assigning the exact locations of individual hawker stalls. Given that these food outlets are an important contributor to Singapore's social fabric, it would be great if google would reconsider and put a team behind the technological fix required. Not only would it serve the local populace but I also believe it would be of keen interest to those tourists who prefer venturing off the beaten path!",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113673418353131258238/reviews
