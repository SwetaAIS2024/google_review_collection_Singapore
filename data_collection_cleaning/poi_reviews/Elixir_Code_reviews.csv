Zheng Xiang Teo,5,"Is a must-visit for craft beer lovers! üç∫üî• They have an impressive selection of imported craft beers, offering unique flavors that you won‚Äôt easily find elsewhere.

Colin Chan,5,"Excellent pseudo-grungy vibes and a superb collection of bottled and on-tap beers  that isn't just a boring collection of XIPAs. Their sampling policy limits each customer to two tries each but the sample pours are very generous.

Place seems a little understaffed, though - when it was time to pay the bartender was nowhere in sight and it turned out he'd gone out for a long smoke.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107951074976008996072/reviews
Renee Cutaia,5,"Really cool little bar that we only just realized was here. They have several beers from Eastern Europe that you wouldn‚Äôt have tried before. Croatia, Georgia, Estonia and even some smoothie beers (sweet beers that have texture of a smoothie but are alcoholic). The place is small and only a few seats but the owners are nice and helpful and it feels like a little hidden community. If you are in the area it‚Äôs a nice place to stop in for a beer. I think they also have some simple food if you want but we just had drinks. The beers are a little expensive but I like that they are on tap. There are also some bottle beers but we prefer the drafts. Nice place.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106852139175204589471/reviews
Halberd Why,4,"cozy little neighbourhood bar with limited but rather decent beer collection. limited seating but somehow was able to find a spot whenever i was there. no bar food but you can bring takeouts so that works.
everything that's right and wrong about this place is that it's a cozy little bar, nothing more nothing less.
if i live nearby or just upstairs i'll enjoy dropping by for a pint after a long day's work.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111164367051367741980/reviews
