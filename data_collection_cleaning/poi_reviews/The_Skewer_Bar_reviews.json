I recommend the skewers (lychee pork and meatball), homemade spam, ngo hiang maki.\n\nService was ok, but i hope the young lady server can be friendlier. Price was ok, paid $69 for 2, but ordered no alcohol.\n\nOverall, I will come back! This place is a hidden gem.",

It's definitely best if paired with beer or any alcoholic drinks, just that I don't drink but even the orange juice is good to go with the skewers. Surely I will bring other friends to come!",

Their homemade luncheon tastes really good too. We also ordered stingray with homemade chili, we enjoyed it a lot. It was really fresh and juicy. Would definitely go back again.",
