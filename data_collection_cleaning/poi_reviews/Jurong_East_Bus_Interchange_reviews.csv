J T,1,"This happened on the 19th of March at around 4.25pm, Jurong East Bus Interchange. I arrived at the interchange and saw on My Transport SG app indicating bus service 335 is arriving in 1 minute time. By the time, I rushed to its bus stand, the information panel verified that it’s arriving. Two minute past and the next thing I know, the information panel suddenly indicated that they wait has turned into a whole 8 minute.

Needless to say, those there were in the same queue as I were visibly frustrated. As I stayed around Jurong West Avenue 1, I actually have two more bus service options to choose (namely 98 and 335), but since not bus stands are placed a whole 5 min walk away from the 334 bus stand, it doesn’t allow passengers to quickly switch queue based on first arriving bus service.

I’m highlighting this as a concerned commuter as our bus service has always been pride for its reliability and transparency. As I understand, Tower Transit is a contracted, I would still hold the very same expectations I would with other bus companies like SBS. This gross lapse were fueled when there was no explanation given by the subsequent driver of the bus service nor was there any attempt to quell on the interchange PA system.

This total disregard to the commuters’ time is concerning and honestly, infuriating. Please do better.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105030137380493684604/reviews
ルーシャスLucius,3,"It is one of the larger size interchanges, however the layout is not the most convenient. Some of the buses which are going to the same directions or at the very two ends of the station, making it very inconvenient for people to choose between two buses. Despite the fact they do have an update on digital schedule board, the timing isn't totally accurate . The location also becomes extremely hectic for both pedestrian and vehicle traffic.

Pros:
Update digital schedule board for bus arrival
Large

Cons:
Digital schedule board isn't totally punctual
The layout of the line is confusing",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103235381099676291640/reviews
