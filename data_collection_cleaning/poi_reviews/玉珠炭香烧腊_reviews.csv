serwei lee,4,"Food is good but they like to sneak off the tender fillet of the chicken when you order half or full chicken. So the breastmeat is flat and of course losing a third of the flesh.
Decided to move to 4 stars from 3 cos their food is pretty good.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113628164651477533634/reviews
