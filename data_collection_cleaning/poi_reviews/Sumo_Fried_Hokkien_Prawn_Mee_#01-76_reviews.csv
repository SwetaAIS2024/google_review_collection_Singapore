David Yeo,4,"AMK does have quite a number of amazing HKM stalls. Today I tried another one at 628 AMK market. Prawn stock was flavorful with some slight wok hei infused. I tasted lots of garlic and egg in the noodles, overall it was a nice blended ratio. Interestingly I see the chef added some crunchy anchovies on top of the noodles.

There's also quite a few supporters, apparently they make a mean fried carrot cake too.

There's my top tier Ho Ji and Ah Jie, this shall be the next AMK tier, joining the ranks of Eng Ho and Zhen Jie. Can order if you are nearby and need a HKM fix.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110172442432868180876/reviews
Kok Seng Ho,5,Ordered a $8 big portion fried Hokkien Prawn Mee that came with 5 big prawns. Got a table near the stall. Went to get a drink 3 stall down. However a bird came to eat my food. The stall owner saw & immediately took my plate of food & throw away. He gave me another fresh plate complimentary. Kind gesture from the stall owner.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117648682109622280565/reviews
TKS,5,"Nice flavorful Hokkien mee, the wet type with medium sized bee hoon. At $6 it comes with 3 medium prawns, sizeable chunks of squid that’s fresh and soft, and crispy ikan bilis. Pity there was no sliced pork. The chilli packed a punch though.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102531088624083541085/reviews
Deepak Kurup,5,"Top 5 fried Hokkien mee I’ve had in Singapore. And I’ve been eating the beautiful noodles for more than 40 years from Zion Road, blk 18 Bedok south, Kim lee to Lorong 39. Carrot cake is very good. House made Sambal is very spicy and normal. Must try if ever in Amk.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109428461381908531705/reviews
William Lu,5,"Wanted to get black carrot cake but served white one. I didn't really mind though and took it anyway. The taste was ok, the chili was not enough for the portion, it can be given more. I ordered $4.5 portion. It was quite big for my breakfast. Serving time was quite long though.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
