Yanne Shy,1,"School has not care of others. especially the traffic has caused an issue to Woodgrove residents. They engage the traffic control but the officer can still let vehicle to stop at road side, or even a turning point where caused the jam to residents who also need to sent off their kids to and off school. Has called many times feedback, with pictures for a year. No action at all. such a International school with big compound yet all vehicles came to jam up residents here with no reason.
Imagine i need to wait for them to in, then u-turn out one by one? Just a 1mins turn back home yet can wait more than 10-30mins?
This is worst than driving at CTE.
Imagine such big school yet can't even let cars drive in for drop off? Even our Singapore local school will not even block the road for that long. So why such international school has the privileges?",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104278878874621534180/reviews
Vyacheslav Golik,1,"They organize the tour unprofessionally with poor knowledge about the school and references to personal experience but not to the school policy.
Good infrastructure but extremely dirty and looks like nobody cares.
The variety of schools in Singapore makes a choice not in favor to SAS.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103467911048979028035/reviews
Secret Santa,3,"There is bullying, and exclusion will not say more. Deans and admins need to step up. I won't get into detail because they know what they must do. I left this school no longer here",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110078694540093915362/reviews
Kate Gardner,5,"As an alumnus and now a parent of two current students, I am proud to be affiliated with SAS. Excellent facilities, a dedicated faculty, and a wide range of program options make this an excellent school. They are finding ways to be inclusive without sacrificing standards and rigor, which is not an easy task in this competitive, often exclusive and ever-changing educational climate.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114760876662256560098/reviews
KK Tan,1,"Spoiled students (treat you terribly if you’re not good looking or outstanding at something —huge rat race, especially if you’re in the wrong group of friends). Lots of uninterested and extremely biased teachers who love to power trip and have huge favourites rather than actually teaching subject material and beyond (expect for a few bright spots). Huge lack of school spirit while there is a lot of bad school food (sodexo is terrible and Hoe’s catering is much better). Most of admin (especially the deans and student council) is also clueless and students who leave the school often don’t come back because of the toxicity they breed and the fact that they don’t listen to student input. Overall an expensive school that doesn’t provide value for money.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117585044741217206183/reviews
