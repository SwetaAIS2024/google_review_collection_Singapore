RayRayRay Tan,5,"Decent hotel bar with a good selection of beers and wines. Singapore pricing is a bit steep but that’s … Singapore.

Food options are limited late but available late which is better than the Jewel which closes too early.

Would I come back? Probably only if required for late night drinks.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115486461183529608992/reviews
Tan,1,"Took advantage of an eatigo 50% promotion.

There are better food alternatives elsewhere, to be honest. The overpriced food isnt worth it even with the 50% promo.

Magherita pizza had a overpowering taste and smell of burnt herbs. “Wagyu” burger patty was hard and dry. Apparently the burger can only be cooked well done.

The truffle fries are actually plain fries with a side of truffle dip. The chicken wings were okay though, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside.

Do come back here only if you have really do not have other options.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109218786892749779878/reviews
Imax Ooi,3,"Pretty nice place, less than mediocre food. Came cos Eatigo had 40%(i can see why now) and had the wagyu beef burger. For 28 dollars u get a welldone (as in cooked thoroughly), dry patty, served with fries and salad. Nonya satay was served colder than the fries, i mean it's a bar and they have an impressive selection of drinks. It has tourist price and should cater to the rich folks staying at the crowne plaza. Would not recommend to locals",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107590007464075621247/reviews
nina chen,1,"First time there and the experience was horrible. I made a reservation and went there after work. Upon reaching, we were told that there’s no 50% discounts for that day because of RWC finals, which we understand, but then we got told no reservations can be made hence there’s no seats for us. It would be nice to have a heads-up so we wouldn’t have made our way down only to find out we can’t get a seat. To find out all these only when we’re at the bar itself makes it feel like a wasted trip.

In the end we stood along the corridor of Crowne Plaza, watching the finals from the corner outside the bar with no food or drinks (so I can’t comment on their food/drinks). I doubt I’ll be giving this place a second try.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108240893783644132450/reviews
