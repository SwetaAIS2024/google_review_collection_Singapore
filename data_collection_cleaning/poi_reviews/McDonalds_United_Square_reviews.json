      "text": "UPD: They sent me the whole new order and everything was fresh, delicious and correct!\nCheating! Beware of Order Issues! Double-Check Before You Leave!\nI ordered chicken wings and a triple cheeseburger (as shown in the attached photo), but I received chicken nuggets and a chicken burger instead. My Prosperity beef burger isnâ€™t not double as you can also see on that photo! Not only was my order completely wrong, but the items I got are also cheaper than what I paid for. This is unacceptable. I do NOT recommend this place! I hope that management will take serious actions because it seems like it happened not only with me! The whole order isnâ€™t correct!",
