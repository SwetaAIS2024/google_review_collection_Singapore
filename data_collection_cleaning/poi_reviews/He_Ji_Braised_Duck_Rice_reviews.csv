C,4,"$5.30 for the pictured duck rice. Really good, duck isn‚Äôt as thin as yewkee‚Äôs you get taukwa and half an egg as well. Soup is a little salty.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109477732884918793623/reviews
LP Pua,2,"Had duck porridge for dinner. The porridge texture was between Teochew porridge and Cantonese congee‚Äînothing special, but no complaints either. The biggest issue was the sweet dark sauce used; it was too sweet and not suitable for the health-conscious. It detracted from the taste of an otherwise good porridge, which I remember used to be better.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews

Ong J Y,5,"The meat portion is generous and the rice is very well infused with flavour, the braised sauce also is thick and complement the duck rice harmoniously. The complementary herbal soup set the store apart from others as it is light and refreshing.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106331454552638496049/reviews
I W,4,"Ordered their Braised Duck Kway Teow ($4.80) and added tofu and an egg, bringing the total to ($6.40).  The portion seemed reasonable for the price.

The braised duck was tender, and the broth had a slight herbal taste.  Kway teow was smooth.  Overall, a very pleasant dish.

Will come back for more if I am in the vicinity.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107686746966044708528/reviews
