chua chee meng,5,"The working environment very dusty, dirty, no air con and fan cover with dust.
The production floor and warehouse stack with big server racks very hot and humid working environment. I almost suffocated and almost get severe headache. No forklift and no tailgate for lorry. In the production floor and warehouse, no lifting crane when carrying and lifting heavy metal and aluminium racks.  All manual labour work, assembly crew doing sanding, buffing, tack welding, spot welding, laser cutting and bending of metal part.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116908566726822814869/reviews
