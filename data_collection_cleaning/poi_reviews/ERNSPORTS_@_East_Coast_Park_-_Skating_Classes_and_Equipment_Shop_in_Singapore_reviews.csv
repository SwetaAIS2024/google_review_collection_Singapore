Mickey X,5,"Highly recommended! Their replies are typically within few hours! Proactive and structured lesson plans for students. My kids love it! The coaches are friendly, approachable and after every lesson they will basically brief the parents what the day’s lesson is covering. My kids can’t wait for the weekend because of the skating classes they have.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113535753790737803193/reviews

Artem Moshnin,5,"The price for skates were very reasonable and the skates were in great condition. The service was especially amazing, all the staff were enthusiastic and helpful. Good environment to learn if you are interested in lessons, and the atmosphere was good too. Thoroughly enjoyed roller blading with the skates they provided and they taught us how to put them on properly as well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114186673531048387843/reviews
