Usually other people there cut my hair wont like that one! First time i went there the lady cut halfway then she disappeared to the back, only came back after 10 mins, then the haircut also ugly! The front was too short even though said slightly above eyebrow, but then she cut 3cm above eyebrow. like hello? you OK or not??? another time i went there and she cut my hair, i CLEARLY stated cut till eyebrows 3 TIMES!!! she didnt bother, and then she still cut above the eyebrows by 3cm. This lady damn stubborn sia. say one thing dunno how to listen one.! one simple instruction also cant follow, say something also dont want to listen!
