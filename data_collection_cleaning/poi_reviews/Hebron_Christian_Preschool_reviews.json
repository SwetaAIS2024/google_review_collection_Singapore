She’s a super stubborn child to handle, but the teachers have had nothing but kind words and loads of patience. I’ve also seen how my child has grown from refusing to talk, to being able to communicate properly without hesitation. Kudos to the teachers and school management for creating a lovely, God-centered, conducive learning environment!",
