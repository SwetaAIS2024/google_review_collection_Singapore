      "text": "The quality of the meat is definitely top-tier among Korean restaurants in Singapore! The price is well worth it for the meat quality, and the sauces are tasty too — not the overly strong flavors you usually find at typical Korean BBQ buffets. The unlimited refillable side dishes are a big plus, and there’s even a complimentary vegetable platter.",

      "text": "This stall at the new Jurong West hawker centre sells Mainland Chinese cuisine. I tried the signature 水煮肉 and opted for chicken which cost $5, and added a bowl of rice for $1. They were very generous with the vegetables and there was a decent amount of chicken. Taste-wise, the dish was on the milder side, probably to cater to the Singaporean palate. It took quite a while to prepare the dish but I think the wait was well worth it!",
