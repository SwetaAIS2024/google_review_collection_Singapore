Ramya Priyadarsini,1,"Such a rude and horrible cashier. Store closes at 10:30pm, went to the shop to buy just one item, i know it is near to the closing time. Not even there at the shop for a minute, she speaks to me in a rude manner to get me done soon, never had this kind of experience in Singapore! Also, selling expired items but no response even when mentioned to the cashier, just asking me to not buy it. SFA must not condone this place.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104754645963030295710/reviews
Shruthi Gupta,1,"Bought two times recently both the products were bad.
Aata had white worms in it and was a torn packet from side. Toor dal has red worms in it.
Itâ€™s pricey comparatively to little India shops.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108923631285328387114/reviews
Baljot Singh Ranu,4,Its a very convenient shop next door to have. You can buy pretty much all of the basic ingredients one needs from here. Most of the produce kept is vegetarian and a few exceptions like eggs or milk products are the only non vegetarian options available. Initially they did try to sell frozen chicken and frozen chicken snacks but no avail to those products caused them to stop keeping it. You may request the shop owner though to seek chicken snacks for you. All in all A good place.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109474113726261978708/reviews
Kannan Sachidanandam,1,"The price is way high particularly for the vegetables. The place is also cramped. Sorry to say it is not a good experience.

Received a response for my earlier review. As I could not find an option to reply, I am adding to the earlier post:

Everyone understands about Covid situation. But the question is how other Indian stores in the surrounding are able to maintain the low price. Here are a few examples

Other Indian stores	Murugan
Greens/ Spinach	$9	        $15
Onion bag	$3.50	      $4.50+
Vegetables	$4.80-$6	$9-$12

The prices are almost doubled. This is highly unethical and mere exploitation of the customers which should be avoided. Would appreciate if the authorities think ethically and take necessary steps to keep prices inline with other stores. Thanks.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100651395242048978935/reviews
rusidy dawood,5,"The cashiers are friendly, even though not all groceries can be found here. Open quite early and closes very late too. Generally it's ok",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111051551210523112449/reviews
