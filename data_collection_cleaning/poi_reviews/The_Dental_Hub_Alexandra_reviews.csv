Helen Lim,5,"Have been taken care of by Dr Jeremy Ng for quite a few years already. He is pro and friendly.  He did my first tooth extraction and was painless! He knew is my first tooth extraction and was very patient and explained every single step he is going to do. Have recommended to a colleague but colleague found the price at Dental Hub a bit ex then neighbourhood clinic.

Maybe Dental hub can introduce some package say 2 times tooth scaling and polishing per year at a discounted price.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110856908496235206051/reviews
