      "text": "Warning to all Shopee buyers: Do not use this as your Shopee Collection Point.\n\nIf you are in the area, use Ace Dymanic Holdings Pte. Ltd. @ 933 Upper Changi Road North instead.\n\nMy version of events are listed in my Return/Refund request to Shopee. It's very irritating when the shop says their closing time is at 10pm (verified by the Condominium's guardhouse) while I'm denied request to collect my parcel slightly before 9.30pm.\n\nReasons cited by the lady owner is that she's closing her shop, but in fact, another customer had just made purchases and walked out. I just needed to collect my item before catching a flight. Would that be very difficult?\n\nFyi, I had used Shopee Collection Points in other areas like Paya Lebar/Geylang and the shops have always been so accommodating (even when I turned up 5 min before closing). What more 30 min before closing time here at RDK Mini Mart?\n\nTo Shopee, I don't this shop deserves your commission. Please delist them. Your buyers would save the inconvenience I faced.",
