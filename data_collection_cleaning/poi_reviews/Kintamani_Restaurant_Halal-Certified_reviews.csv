Clarence Ow,5,"Very affordable, delicious and high value buffet, located at Furama Riverfront Hotel. (It is even more worthwhile if you use Chope using weekday lunch.)

As it is also Halal Certified, it is a excellent place for large group gathering. The large seating area will easily accommodate this.

Most of their cooked dishes are delicious. I love their lamb chop, rendang beef and the chicken. Their soup of the day (Kambing soup/ oxtail soup) is superb.

Other than cooked food, they also offer quite a variety of pastries, cold seafood, fruits and drink.

A definitely happy to eat buffet that is affordable too.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112234615480628100933/reviews

Awesome Ness,3,First time trying this indo lunch buffet restaurant. Couldnâ€™t give 4 stars because the mee soup is cold not really hot for the soup . The fried dumplings are lame not crispy . Think the chef cook and prepare the food quite early before the buffet started . Platter of fruits are soggy been cut or prepare the day before so not really fresh . Overall is a good dining experience,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115771709954242195749/reviews

Guang En Ang,5,"Value for money. At $25 (after ++ and 50% eatigo, you get mussels, crab, lamb and they are all q tasty. There was snow crab legs for lunch when I went, even though it seems only for dinner. Could be because of some one-off reason but makes it even more worth.

However, the crab (cooked) seems not fresh, loose meat.

The restaurant looks pretty small so better to reserve during peak periods",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118292651592277363535/reviews
