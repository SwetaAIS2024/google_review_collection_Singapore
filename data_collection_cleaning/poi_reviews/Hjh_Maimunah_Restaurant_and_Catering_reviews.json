Taste and texture was definitely what we were going for. 35 bucks for everything felt very very justifiable. Craving satisfied, hearts contented, stomachs filled. ðŸ’šðŸ’šðŸ’š",

      "text": "I guess the ordering system is like most nasi padang, where u can have the sides together, or separately on plates (a lot of customers did that to share the sides).\n\nQueue starts from the dish side and when I arrived at 11.40am, there was no queue. Once I got my food and paid, there was a 5-6 pax queue. After I had my lunch, the queue was something like 15-20 pax! Come early if you donâ€™t want to queue\n\nI had their sayur lodeh (yums), sambal quail eggs (spicy and yums), chicken rendang (yums again). My only complaint qualm is that I wished the dishes were hot / warm. Some of the dishes was getting a little cold.",
