OCS 王志信,5,"The stall sell fish soup noodle & shen mian (生面) with minced pork, pork liver, veggie and egg with superior soup. I order less noodle more soup w/o egg cos it affect the superior soup taste. Tried fish soup with added pork liver but I prefer just pork shen mian (No. 11) w/o egg. The pork liver pcs are fresh and usually just cooked. They have other noodle type like bee hoon and ban mian etc. The stall close earlier on Sat, Sun & PH around 3/4pm. It’s my number 1 choice for pork noodle soup in SG although it’s a challenge to eat the piping hot noodle soup in Singapore summer weather.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117970500885014785446/reviews
dawn teow,5,"This is my family's favourite mee hoon kueh and ban mian in the whole of Singapore. The soup is so tasty, the noodles are next level QQ and the portions are so big. What more could we ask for?

Pro tip, if you like pork liver, ask to add pork liver because it is LIFE CHANGING.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105808201694297570655/reviews
Sam Wong,5,"I ordered mee hoon kueh with fish slices($5.50). This mee hoon kueh is hand-torn old school type and is firm, with a naturally sweet soup base and tender fish slices. Medium portion. 8/10",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115694236480258826587/reviews
Max S.,5,"U mian at this stall was pretty good for $4. Generous portions and the soup was tasty. Good amount of both noodles and pork. I didn’t like that the egg was crushed but maybe it was just accidental.

Still overall it’s super value for money!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101834880193042109600/reviews
Kwong Fei Yee,5,"Ordered the fish soup and the sheng mian. For fish soup, most important is the taste of the soup and for a typical consumer, the amount of fish. Please not that the bowl of fish soup noodle in this photo is with extra $1 of fish. They gave batang fish which is an expensive fish. All in all 5 stars.

The sheng mian was also very nice. The noodle still springy and the soup thick and nice.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118030178376808365901/reviews
