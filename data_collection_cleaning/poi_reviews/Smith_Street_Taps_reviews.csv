Wei Ern ONG,4,"Had the Suruga Bay double IPA, great on a hot afternoon. The full pint is more value-for-money.

Please note that this is a hawker stall, so there is no aircon. No tasters but v pleasant staff who are able to recommend based on your preferences.

The stall location is a bit out of the way but you can refer to the directional pictures in this post; the stall unit number is #02-62.

If travelling by train, access is easiest by Exit A of Chinatown MRT.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100443726692333908509/reviews
The Biodynamic Duo,5,"Definitely not for the faint-hearted — but perfect for those who truly appreciate a strong, characterful and unique location.

Been coming to this craft beer spot since around 2018, and it’s easily one of my all-time favourites (it’s also the first craft beer that opened in a hawker center)

The vibe is always laid-back but buzzing, and the staff make you feel right at home

Bonus points: amazing food from all the other stalls but please come in the evening.

First timers might need a bit of directions, don’t be shy abd ask",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101966057015930925345/reviews

Paul Allen,4,"I was excited to come here, as I have heard a lot about it.
The selection of beers is great, with some collaboration beers.
The prices are good (no ++ Compared to other bars)
But the atmosphere was not good, it's in a hawker market - but a more empty area, with dirty tables and bad smells.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117971941253379146602/reviews
Graham Budd,5,"Loved this place. Small tap list but all good beers and hard find elsewhere.
You get the best of both worlds here. Cracking craft beers and your choice of hawker meals from one of the hundreds of stalls in the market.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109396293730601030424/reviews
