I however not in favour of share dining areas with smoking area. Always a Q but service is fast. Run by elderly woman.",

      "text": "Found out about this place through Alderic's YouTube channel. I previously came on a Saturday but they were closed that day. Decided to make a trip back since I was clearing leave.\n\nThey have quite a few ingredients and the only ones I didn't get were the fishcake, chicken cutlet and fish fillet. Thus, what you see in the photo will be chicken wing, fish, egg, tempeh, sausage, bergedil and ikan bilis. These ingredients were quite average and they had been sitting at the counter for a while.\n\nWhat I really liked was the rice and sambal. You definitely need to try the rice on its own before mixing it with any other thing. It has the classic nasi lemak taste and fragrance not commonly found at other nasi lemaks nowadays.\n\nIf I could, I would just buy their rice, sambal and ikan bilis, and use these to eat with other ingredients.",
