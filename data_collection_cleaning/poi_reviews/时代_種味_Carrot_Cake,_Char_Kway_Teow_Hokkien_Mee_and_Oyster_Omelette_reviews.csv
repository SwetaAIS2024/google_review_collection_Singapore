Carmen L,5,"This is the only carrot cake stall in the hawker centre. It has a nondescript shop front but saw good success when it opened recently.

A fairly large portion of carrot cake was generously served for a low price of $3. The egg was still slightly crispy at the edges and the radish cubes had a good bite. I finished my meal without feeling like it was too oily or greasy.

The char kway teow and oyster omelette seemed to be a hit with other patrons too. Do go early as the food sells out fast.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113784368027194022523/reviews
