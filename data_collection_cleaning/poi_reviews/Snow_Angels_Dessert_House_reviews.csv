Celeste Lim,1,"Agree with other reviews that the male & female owners have poor customer service. Attitude is unfriendly. Bingsu at $15.90 for the portion and condiment is overpriced, see photos attached. Ownersâ€™ daughter displays better customer service to her friends than the owners did to their customers. Place was not well air-conditioned and had flying ants zooming around.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112163369675114949862/reviews
Shiro Tan,5,"Best Bingsu in Singapore! In Bukit Batok!
The shaved ice was really smooth and powdery, reminiscent of the ones I had in Seoul!
Snow Angels in Le Quest.
The shop is facing the main road on street level.
Can't wait to try the other flavours. They have savoury ones too.

Update (back again just 1 day after I visited it):
Their Signature Injeolmi Snow bingsu ($15.90) was very delicious too, though I personally prefer the matcha one ($12.90) as it had the ingredients which I like. The Chicken and egg waffles ($15.90) was a good combination. The waffles was so tasty that I didn't need to dip it into the maple syrup that was given and could still eat it even when I was so full! Highly recommend this place. Looks so modest but able to deliver high quality food!

Update (3rd visit):
Ordered matcha bingsu again. Consistent, very good though the ingredients were slightly less (guess the first time was more due to opening special?). Ordered the bacon and egg waffles. Saved $4 as I bought the voucher on ShopBack for $9.90. Original price $13.90.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101345161135004060754/reviews
Brian Loh,4,"Nice desert house within neighborhood. Tasty pancakes and ice cream.
Friendly staff, polite and serve well.
Convenient parking area within mall and within walking distance from neighborhood.
Nice area for friends gathering and family with kids.
Reasonable pricing too, good to chill during hot weather.
Will return soon.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116474476362383193496/reviews
Lim sioleng,5,"A loud call out to all Matcha Bingsu lovers. This bingsu is finely shaved and is matcha flavoured on every bite. With generous toppings of almond slices and red beans,  this bingsu can easily feed 2-3 pax. One of the best bingsu I had so far. Definately worth a visit- Snow Angels at Le Quest:)",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115486312701647712385/reviews
YP Soo,5,"Lucky to have a dessert place near my house which close late 12 midnight.

Many choices of bingsu. Repeat visit for bingsu - tried choco banana this time round which was good.

Also tried the mango, strawberry and berries yogurt bingsu. All good.

Have yet to try their waffles and gelato.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107739220722281476081/reviews
