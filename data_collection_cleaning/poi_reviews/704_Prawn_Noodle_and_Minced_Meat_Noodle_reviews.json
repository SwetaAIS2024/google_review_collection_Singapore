      "text": "The meat after cook, i believe it add abit of soy sauce or salt. So after each bite you can taste the soft meat as well as a hint of saltiness. Good balance on the dry version for chilli and other garnish. For soup, it taste is on the heavy side but not over powering. Price wise not expensive but on a higher price due to the ingredients.",

      "text": "Try out this prawn mee after my friend highly recommended it.\n\nThe soup is very robust and high in prawn taste. But a little bit too sweet. Suitable for soup lovers.\n\nWent for Mee Kia dry. Not your typical mee Kia. Theirs is slightly boarder. More doughy in taste and a bit sticky to the teeth. Dun really fancy it.\n\nPork lard and fried onion is superbly crispy and fragrant. Very well done.\n\nPork slice is very clean and nicely poached. Most is over cook till it‚Äôs hard and loss its tenderness. But they does it perfectly.\nPork ribs is nicely seasoned but would prefer it to be softer.\n\nPrawn is mid size. Slice in half. Given 4. Very fresh and sweet. The more U chew the sweeter it gets.\n\nOverall for $8, it‚Äôs a little bit steep. But quality is definitely good. But I dun really like their dry version. Chili is not fragrant enough and spicy enough for me. Taste is coming from the pork lard and Gallic and fried onion more. Can get too oily at times. Soup confirm will be a better choice.",

Taste wise, it‚Äôs up there with the likes of Beach Road and Jalan Sultan prawn noodle, can feel the details are taken care of with the nicely cleaned prawns and selected pork ribs, I can‚Äôt find fault due to the price differences and uniqueness among them but I will definitely come back if craving for prawn noodle, parking is easy across the road and the food court is breezy and clean, not too crowded too.",
