k d,1,Plain and simple doctor is missing in action and was told to wait up to an hour for him/her to be back. Will not be filling any ridiculous form from raffles abt this experience - this is just to educate other fellow passengers it’s not a clinic you should rely upon.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103109094584239106821/reviews
Purnama Prasetyo,1,"My 6-yr old child needed a quick treatment, which was replied that we had to wait for an hour until a doctor/nurse came in. We consulted with our doctor by phone and was told to just lie down so we came back to this facility asking whether she could just lie down in the emergency room, but again was told that ""what if other passengers need a treatment, etc etc.."" which was weird as if us and our daughter were not passengers who needed a very simple help & treatment..
So in my conclusion this facility was only put there as a ""I don't know what for"" medical facility because no matter the condition it seemed impossible to get some help out of this facility. This happened on July 20th 2024, at around 1700ish hours SG time if needed a review from CCTV from the management.. Fyi, my child was experiencing bleeding and need a light treatment and lie down while waiting for our airplane.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101909101262454557107/reviews
Edmund Tan,1,Went at 7am. No doc. Said coming fr T3 and aware I have 8am flight. 7:18am doc still at T3. I cancelled though nurse said they know my flight time. I got to gate just as it was closing. So to state obvious you’re responsible for your own time keeping.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114139400034437009832/reviews
Ilya Utkin,1,"We visited the clinic due to an emergency, but the service was extremely slow. While the receptionist and the doctor were okay, one of the other staff members was extremely rude.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101492176898837252212/reviews
Bregham Dalgliesh,1,"I went into the Medical Centre prior to my departure with a presumed ear infection, which was wrongly diagnosed. The doctor in charge attempted to dislodge the wax in my ear, without success. Upon returning home 3 days later, I discovered that I actually had a serious throat infection, which effected my ear but there was no actual ear infection, hence the efforts of the doctor in vain to cure it! When I wrote to complain of a total misdiagnosis, my claim was dismissed and no compensation or apologies were offered. Clearly their bottom line is to make money from travellers who don't have any alternative.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106561865882746909053/reviews
