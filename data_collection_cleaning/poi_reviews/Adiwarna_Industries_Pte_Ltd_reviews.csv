Lifelong Learning Initiative,5,"Nea approved sanitizer supplier .

Thanks to the team for working hard during the period.  Even during lunch time they are still doing their best to settle the crowd so they don‚Äôt have to queue so long

I love the disinfectant spray so much, not overwhelming smell.
Sanitizer are not too pricey.
Brought them for my company own use, many customer asking abt it after use üëçüèª.

Highly recommend.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115215518191976708221/reviews
Vanessa Kwan,5,"Honest family business. In time of need, where sanitizers are not available in stores and price hikes online, this family sells at their usual price $19.95 for 500ml and limit quantity per customer to ensure everyone gets some. They also extended opening hours and even open during the weekend to meet customer demand. Really appreciate! :)",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103539121096320090832/reviews

"Chan Wei De, Victor",1,"Horrible experience. Was told that there was stock available, headed down 15mins later only to be told that there isnt any stock left.
