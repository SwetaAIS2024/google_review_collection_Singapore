      "text": "My family feels very fortunate to meet Ms Sylvia Ng to coach my 8 years old son on piano. As a talented pianist herself, not just a piano teacher, she knows firsthand what it takes to identify, inspire and develop one's music potential to mastery - be it patience, intentional practice, tailored feedback, systematic progressing, master guidance and inspiration, etc. She gives them all wholeheartedly to her students.\n\nWithin a year under her guidance, my son has passed ABRSM grade 2 and 3 with merit and on his way to pass grade 5. She sees my son's potential to pass diploma even before turning 9. Grades aside, my son has been enjoying playing piano and is very proud of his achievement.\n\nBack to \"Sylvia Ng Piano Studio - West Coast Drive\", she knows what her music students need very well to provide this little, angelic and conducive concert studio for them to learn, practice and perform piano, gradually and ritually to a larger and cosmopolitan stage.",
