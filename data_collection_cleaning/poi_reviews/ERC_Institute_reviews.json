      "text": "I took Diploma in Tourism and Hospitality under Mr Nicholas. He's a very honest teacher and teaches very well. He was always open to answering my questions or any doubts that I had, and he explained it very clearly to me. When I was a new student in ERC, I had some problems understanding the lesson but he was very patient and made sure I eventually understood. While doing our project presentations, he gave me very good advice on how to do well. ERC Institute was a very good experience for me. My friends were the ones that introduced ERC to me and I have no regrets studying here. I have now completed my Diploma in ERC and hope to further my studies even more here as well.",

      "text": "This ERC institute is really not worth at all. Seems like they are more focused on money vs Academics. The tutors are not certified trainers and were working in some bars and brought them here for cheap wages and made as Tutors. Please refrain from taking admission from this Institute. You will definitely feel sorry for taking admission from this institute when you attend the classes and after completing the course. You will only get vessel washing jobs if you study here. Plz don't waste your money here. Cheap institute.",

In ERCI, they have offered a lot of opportunities, like scholarships, volunteer projects, and team-building activities. The teachers are really supportive too. It’s been great for my growth both academically and personally. Plus, all the resources and networking events have been awesome for getting ready for my future career.",

      "text": "Brothers, do not take admission in any ERC institute, it is a very bad school and takes money again and again and does not even provide any way, on the contrary, it puts the arrangements on us. If you take a project, then you face problems for intership, then it creates problems and takes the money. I say, you will have to go to India, we are not responsible for this, they say, then do not take any admission in this or school timing is absolutely bad. Thank you\n\n￼",
