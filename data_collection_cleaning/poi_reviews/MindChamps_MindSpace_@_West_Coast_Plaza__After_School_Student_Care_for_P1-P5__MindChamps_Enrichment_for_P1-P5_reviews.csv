Hakim Ahmadjirony,5,"I would highly recommend MS WCP. Top Management, Ernest, is a like-minded father just like the rest of us and is sincere and honest. The Centre Director, Ms Jas, is compassionate and able to manage the teachers and centre well. Teachers, Ms Siti and Ms Husna, are capable and passionate in teaching. I see improvement in my child's both academic and holistic development. Its a good learning and safe space for kids to be in after school.
