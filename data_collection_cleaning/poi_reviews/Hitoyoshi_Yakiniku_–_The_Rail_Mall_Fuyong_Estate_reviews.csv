Chew Chee Chin,5,"The premium beef set came with a good spread, including A5 Wagyu Tartare, A5 Wagyu Karubi, Beef Rib, and Beef Plate, all grilled to perfection. Alongside, we had a hearty bowl of Seafood Kimchi Soup and a comforting plate of Nira Tama, which is stir-fried garlic chive with soft scrambled eggs.
â€¢
To make the experience even more indulgent, we added a few more items â€” Iberico Collar, Chicken Thigh (shio), and some juicy scallops.
â€¢
These were grilled together with an assortment of vegetables like shiitake and eringi mushrooms, Japanese sweet potato, onion, pumpkin, carrot, and baby corn â€” a balanced touch to all the meat.
â€¢
The side dishes also deserve a shoutout. Cold tofu with sesame sauce, spinach namuru, kimchi, pickled lotus root, bean sprouts (kon namuru), chuka wakame (seaweed), ajitamago goma, and shio cabbage â€” each was flavourful, and we even went back for seconds for most of them.
â€¢
What stood out was the quality of the beef â€” the marbling was stunning, and most cuts only needed a quick sear on the grill before they were ready.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110673035627675792942/reviews
Ming Shen Tham,5,"Came here for dinner with my family and had a great experience. The ingredients were fresh, and there was a huge variety of food to choose fromâ€”including different cuts of meat and a wide selection of seafood.

One thing I really appreciated was the strong ventilation systemâ€”unlike many other BBQ places, you donâ€™t walk out smelling like smoke and grilled meat, which is a big plus.

My only small pet peeve is that they use an electric grill instead of charcoal. While I always wonder if this affects the taste, I have to say the food still turned out great, so it wasnâ€™t really an issue.

Overall, Iâ€™d definitely visit againâ€”a solid spot for yakiniku with fresh ingredients and a comfortable dining environment!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116082735539712168059/reviews
Vee Kwok,4,"Went for a walk along the rail corridor and stumbled upon this yakiniku restaurant with set lunch. One can order any 2 items to make this a set, ie free bowl of rice, miso soup and small dishes (refillable). The small dishes are not bad particularly like their fried luncheon meat slices and sesame tofu. The meat portions are a bit small if you order premium cuts like wagyu, eg wagyu tare (sliced like a lady's pinky finger) but the quality overall not bad. My mom and my favorite is the king hanami. Service is not bad either, the place pretty empty in Christmas eve afternoon.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112685768201094418038/reviews
