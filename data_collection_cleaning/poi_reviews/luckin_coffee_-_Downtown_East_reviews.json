The staff was also great, the first day I dropped by, the staff said something like “enjoy your drink”. Thank you haha\n\nMatcha latte was nice and I could taste the matcha more over the latte. I liked that. Matcha frappe was pleasant for my taste buds too! And of course, the frappe had more milk taste than the latte.",

Haven’t even ask finish, the pink hair girl ask me to just order on the phone. I used my phone to check and it still didn’t specify what’s in it. Then I asked her again. Then she speak So soft? Who can hear? Then when my order is ready, she just left it there? Without calling number ? After I realised it’s ready,  took my own straw, my own cup holder, my own napkin. Then wanted to put MY CUPS into bag. Then she bothered to help me? Dk how ask before? Or her job just make coffee only. cannot do anyt else. Very irritating customer service",

I expected a rich and satisfying experience, but it fell flat. The atmosphere was okay, but that couldn't make up for the subpar drink. Unfortunately, I won’t be returning for coffee again. There are far better options out there that truly deliver on quality and taste.",
