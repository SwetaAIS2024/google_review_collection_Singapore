Jack T,3,"Had visited this shop many times with family. Had been very pleasant until our very last visit.. The PRC lady taking our order had been very pushy. Despite ordering total of 10 frogs with 2 pot or porridge for a family with two little girls, she was pushing us very hard to order additional veg dish despite our rejection. She even told us she need to meet her target to sell veg dishes to customers....

Ng Wee Kiat,5,"Their kung bao frog is very tasty and service was fast. Better service than the infamous one at geylang lor 3.  Can try some of their zichar dishes which are nice too. I tried their fried pork intestines previously.
