Kennard Lee,5,"Brought my mom and kids here to eat. Service was prompt and staff were very nice. We didn’t have to wait long for the food. The food was delicious and my kids loved it, especially the fried rice and the red bead pancakes.
The surrounding was peaceful and nice. Good place for a chill lunch on Saturday. Will bring my family here again for sure.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101583915550373480042/reviews

Heartyheart,3,"Menu didn't state that the signature pork bone  ramen comes with lots of kelp. It's quite off putting, affected my appetite and totally changes the taste of the broth, cannot taste what's signature about it. Too many vegetable and colour of the dish matters as well. The pork prawn dumpling is very generous and big portion though.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102082257162676219106/reviews

Dru Lu,4,"Don’t compare this with DTF then you’ll likely find the dining experience to be quite pleasant. The service is really good.

Comparing to DTF, I think the hot and sour soup is too thick making the texture gooey. I think it’s strange to serve noodle in pork broth when you ordered chicken doodle. The texture of the middle is really smooth and good though.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115927493800245457440/reviews
