      "text": "Our family has been with Iroha Japanese Kindergarten for over a year and a half now, and we couldn’t be more pleased with the experience. Neither my husband nor I speak a word of Japanese, but Iroha has truly exceeded our expectations in many ways.\n\nLocation & Facilities: We were drawn to the surrounding environment, particularly the Singapore Stadium area. It’s a rare find—a fully sheltered space with no motorized vehicles, right next to an MRT station. It’s perfect for young children, providing both safety and convenience.\n\nLanguage Acquisition: One of the most impressive aspects is how effortlessly our son has learned Japanese. He speaks it fluently, almost like a native. As adults, we know how challenging it can be to pick up a new language, so seeing our child learn it naturally has been incredible.\n\nCultural Exposure: Every day, our son is immersed in Japanese culture—from the food to the customs. We are particularly impressed by the school’s attention to detail and the politeness of both the staff and the children. The teachers are not only kind and nurturing but also exceptionally friendly, soft-spoken, and genuinely dedicated to the children’s well-being.\n\nDiverse & Inclusive Environment: Kudos to the management team under Mr. David! The student body is diverse and international, and children never feel like outsiders—even if they don’t speak Japanese. It’s a wonderful environment for families from all walks of life.\n\nWe highly recommend Iroha Japanese Kindergarten to not only Japanese families but also to local Singaporeans and expats who appreciate Japanese culture and values. It’s truly a special place for young children to grow and learn.",
