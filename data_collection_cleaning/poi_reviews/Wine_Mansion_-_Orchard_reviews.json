Draft Sapporo (both lager and dark) was $6 for half pint and $11 for full pint, excluding service charge, during Happy Hour (11am-8pm). Very quiet, perfect for chilling on your own or chatting with friends. It doesnâ€™t sell food but I think you can buy them from the supermarket Eccellente.",

Got a good collection of wines for either to drink or buy for take away. Staff is very friendly and now Monkey Shoulders promotion is going on, where you need a scan a code and get 2 pegs of whiskey for free. Tried another mixed fruit with cranberry juice cocktail and taste was good.",
