Aloysius,5,"Excellent childcare... I would rate it 6 out of 5 stars!
Great teachers, easy check in check out process. The teachers there make it a point to call the kids there by name even those not directly under their charge.

They have got a great principal - Marie Luo. She really makes it a point to engage and interact with parents and provide updates opportunistically.

My son has a great playgroup year with teacher Mista and teacher Hua! They really helped him adapt to school life. He was initially very shy and afraid to go to school but they really helped to ease him in.

In N1, teacher Mista and teacher Zhou helped me to really improve his linguistic skills.

in N2, teacher Estelle was excellent. She always provide timely updates and made sure that Titus is comfortable in school. His social and language skills really skyrocketed! My son actually enjoys going to school and would miss school - I think that is a great testament to how good his teachers are.

Currently in K1, he continues to improve under teacher Estelle. He got teacher Jia Jia as his Chinese teacher and now he really enjoy Chinese and his fluency in speaking Mandarin has really improved!

In summary, it is a great pre-school and easy recommendation.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104629751840441608580/reviews
