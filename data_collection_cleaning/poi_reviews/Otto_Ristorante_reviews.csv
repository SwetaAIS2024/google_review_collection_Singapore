Clara X,5,"Had a very lovely dinner at Otto - service was fantastic and food was amazing. One of the best risottos Iâ€™ve had, and steak was nicely prepared for medium rare. Thank you Simone and Chef for the wonderful hospitality!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110287810773521758/reviews
Kenneth Khoo,5,"This Italian restaurant offers a delightful dining experience, particularly with its lunch set selection. From the moment you enter, the well-designed restaurant settings create a welcoming atmosphere, complemented by helpful staff ready to assist.

To start, they serve warm bread accompanied by olive oil, setting the tone for a satisfying meal. However, the timing of the service could use some improvement; the appetizers took about 15 minutes to arrive, followed by the mains, which came 20 minutes after the appetizers were finished. While this wait might test your patience, the quality of the food makes it worthwhile.

The appetizers are tasty, and the mains do not disappoint, showcasing the restaurant's commitment to authentic Italian flavours. The desserts, perfect for sharing, add a sweet conclusion to the meal.

Overall, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit, especially for their lunch set, which offers great value for delicious food in a pleasant setting.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103093501586049252845/reviews

Deborah Widjaja,5,"Went here for Christmas with my family and we thoroughly enjoyed the selection of foods we ordered. The roast pork had the crispiest skin, the burrata cheese tasted so fresh with Parma ham, the Hokkaido scallops were beautifully seasoned. The staff were pleasant and friendly as well. Would highly recommend this place for a nice meal or special occasion ðŸ˜Š",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110268630505362069636/reviews
