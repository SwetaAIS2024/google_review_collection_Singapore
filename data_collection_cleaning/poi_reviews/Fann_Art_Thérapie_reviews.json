      "text": "I had the most relaxing and therapeutic afternoon at Fann Art Therapie.\n\nFannie‚Äôs home is so cosy and well planned for the workshop. She is such a warm and patient teacher. Gives clear explanation and guidance on the tooling and stringing method.\n\nShe is also a wonderful host. Tiny details like a welcome drink, in between coffee break, banana and sweets to keep the energy up and lastly a slice of cake to end the workshop for a job well done ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nHighly recommended üëçüèª",

      "text": "Had an amazing first time trying mandala string art with Fann Art Therapie!\n\nFannie and her husband, Stephen, were very welcoming, friendly and hospitable. They immediately served my boyfriend and I homemade mocktails upon arrival, and even served us cakes, more drinks and chatted with us after the session.\n\nFannie showed us various samples of string art displayed around their house and let us choose the design we wanted. She was also very helpful in helping us decide the colours. She gave simple and clear instructions on how to get started and patiently watched us do it the entire time while providing assistance when necessary.\n\nI loved how the session did not have a hard time limit and Fannie let us do the string art at our own pace, making the entire process enjoyable and therapeutic. The workspace was also very relaxing.\n\nThe entire experience was so memorable and special. I had a really great time and I would recommend anyone and everyone to give it a go! You will definitely be able to take home a beautiful product regardless of your art skills!",
