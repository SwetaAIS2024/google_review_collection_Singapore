khanh linh,4,"Valuable combo. Taste not so specific but not bad, fresh meats. Place quiet smoky even we sit outside.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106052650711284514899/reviews
MHL,3,"Feels like the review is rigged. How is this 4.7 star, itâ€™s 3.5star at most. Feels like the franchised stores like siam mookata etc is better than this.

Platter $39.90 is ok, $9.90 abalone slice is abit ex but quite nice.. the plate is charred too easily and unable to scrap off, pork and chicken is quite nice though. The soup is quite plain, didnâ€™t order more and decided to go for 2nd round.

We were seated near the entrance but is still smoky, your entire body and hair will smell of the mookata after ðŸ˜…",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109767885655690269203/reviews
Andrew Teoh,5,"It's my first time here, the food and service was awesome! Especially the tom yum soup. The pork belly and chicken meat was fresh and fantasically smooth.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116444560815327197115/reviews
Hui Ting,5,"Great place to eat mookata, food was fresh, and tasty! Recommend to add a tomyum Maggie to make it tomyum soup base haha! Very nice experience. But hoping the place to have air vent to absorb the smoke, my sinus cannot take it haha. Overall nice experience! The set meal was worth the price",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105982097971353514218/reviews
Dylan Li,5,"We went for a late night dinner and really enjoyed the meal! I haven't had mookata before, but it's almost like a mix of bbq and hotpot. We ordered the $39.90 set, which was not quite enough to feed 3, but certainly enough for 2. Everything tasted good, and I have no complaints!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227455027475284936/reviews
