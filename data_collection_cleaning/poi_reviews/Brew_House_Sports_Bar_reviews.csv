Q,3,"Overall, would rate this place 3.5/5. We ordered fish and chips. While the food was nice, we waited 45 minutes for the food to arrive. The staff only informed us of the delay after we had waited for 30 minutes. It would have been good if he could inform us earlier as we were rushing for time. That said, the place had good and chill vibes. It was not crowded for a sunday evening.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117965520054989170609/reviews
