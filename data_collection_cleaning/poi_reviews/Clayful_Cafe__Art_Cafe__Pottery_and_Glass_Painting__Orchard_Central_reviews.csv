The Genesis Family,5,"Clayful Cafe in Orchard Central offers a fun and creative escape!  ðŸŽ¨  The cafe provides a relaxing environment to paint your own pottery and glassware. There's a good variety of pieces to choose from and the staff are friendly and helpful.  The food and drinks are decent, but the real draw is the painting experience. It's a great place for a unique date, fun with friends, or even a solo afternoon of creativity.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114071894759795666732/reviews
Isabella Andrews,3,"I visited this place to make hand-painted plates as gifts for friends, and it was such a lovely experience. However, my final pieces didnâ€™t turn out the way I had hoped, and the staff needs to ensure that customersâ€™ pieces are not damaged by avoidable accidents.

The space is charming, the atmosphere is cozy, and the staff are super friendly. Itâ€™s a great spot to relax and spend time with friends while painting adorable ceramic pieces.

I was disappointed when I came to collect my plates after they were glazed and fired. One plate from the first batch had clay speckles caused by the kiln - understandable. But the second plate had a scratch caused during the glazing process. I also noticed another customer at my table whose piece was over-glazed.

While itâ€™s a cute spot to hang out, Iâ€™d recommend keeping your expectations low about how your final products might turn out after firing.

I get that accidents happen, but if issues like this are frequent, it might be worth revisiting the process to ensure the fired pieces reflect the effort customers put into them. ðŸ’•",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104958428282193539569/reviews
Ly,5,"Pleasantly surprised by the salmon grain bowl, soufflÃ© pancake and buttercream latte. For a place that is also doubling up for clay art, the food was really enjoyable. We ended up just eating and chatting. Will definitely come back again.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100802167856120266777/reviews
