Joseph Solomon Soh,3,"This is the exact church which is part of the CLCN and the offshoot and also the sister church of Church of Singapore. Likewise, this is also the same church that birthed out Impact Life Church.

Grew up from there, but one thing I am turned off was the lack of outreach to the millenials (before 2016), and the larger emphasis from the Mandarin congregation.

In terms of worship experiences, I would say they are suitable for all ages, as they are largely still conservative and you would not expect charismatic way of worship like those in megachurches or like their offshoot church, Impact Life Church.

Lastly, I gave it a three out of five due to the church website ""not-user-friendly"" and ""mobile-friendly"" as if I were a visitor, I would have difficulties in navigating them as it may be confusing to some, though in other areas it is a blessing to many generations.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103479062965698779450/reviews
