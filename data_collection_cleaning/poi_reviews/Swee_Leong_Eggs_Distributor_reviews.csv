LF,1,Very dishonest vendor. Used to be good not sure why it has become like that. I hope that I am not wrong but I had been buying from here so I know the quality. The amount you paid for extra AAA they will switch uaing the AA geade which is smaller and replaced with only 2 or 3 extra large eggs.

Naomi Chan,5,Really love their eggs as itâ€™s bigger and much cheaper than supermarket brands! This tray of eggs with orange yolks only cost $8.80.
