They've recently renovated and tidied up the space, which makes the entire experience much more hygienic and palatable.\n\nA good variety of hawker food stalls here at the hawker centre, including the famous Bak Chor Mee Soup. Otherwise, it's more of a day time hawker centre; not many stalls are open in the evenings.",
