Racheal Nesamani,4,I find the Store Manager (Mr Andrew) very helpful and quick in his service to the customers. When I took my school children for a learning trip to the mini mart he was friendly and welcoming. It is wonderful to have such a person like Mr Andrew who is polite and cheerful. Thank you Mr Andrew.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107200347036814865213/reviews

Irene Tan,1,"I have no complaints when the incharge was a chinese man, in his 50s. He was friendly and helpful. I always can get what i want, never out of stock. Is a pity that he has left. Currently, the minimart is no longer as good as before. There are many times which i cant get what i want. Is either no stock or stock has not arrived yet. Plsssssssss, do look into this as it is causing lots of inconvenience to the residents here.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110344440474262585073/reviews
fadhz fazrul,2,It‚Äôs always the staff that gives the brand bad reputation. I would often patronize the shop in the evening right after 7.30pm to 7.45pm. Often i see the staff gives bad service. Today of all days the guy wasn‚Äôt srvc oriented and kinda ‚Äúhmm‚Äù yet frowning when i said ‚Äúno need bag yeah‚Äù in a polite tone. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116332520054975192970/reviews
