Adam Ismail,5,"I tried the nasi lemak and it was really good and affordable. Rarely I get nasi lemak set under $4 nowadays.

The sambal is shiok.
The rice is fragrant with the right amount of coconut milk flavour.
The fried chicken wing is flavourful to the bone.

My only feedback is that the foodcourt is quite warm in the morning.

The uncle and auntie serving the food are also warm and friendly folks.

This place is located at Level 4 Sin Ming Autocare by the way.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109210815397801372164/reviews
Gargleblaster,2,"4.8 kinda suckered me in. Bought 2 different chicken styles to try and both were rock hard and my metal spoon got bent out of shape trying to eat the wings. If you are here waiting for your car and hungry, by all means but donâ€™t try expecting a 4 star meal. Better having a drink and waiting it out.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106969202599971461073/reviews
