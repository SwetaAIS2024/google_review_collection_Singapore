Rebecca Koh,2,"We went for the June holiday camp at west coast. For the first 3 days we were assigned very young trainers. Trainers lack experience and there was little structure to the camp. Gears were in bad condition, overstretched and loose and half of them couldn't stay on and kept slipping. An experienced trainer joined on the last day but only focused on the younger kids. End up the children failed to learn the right techniques even after 2.5hrs x 4 days.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104828834888616405661/reviews
