Still upset about the outcome but that's more on the bene bank.\n\nTotally struggling with a cross border payment to India (in USD) at the moment. The payment has been made about 5 times in the past and for some strange reason this one they decide to say there is an issue. Have taken the money out of my account, but have not paid the bene...What's up?!?!\nPaying suppliers is key to ensuring a sound business relationship. This bank isn't helping right now....",

But for established or business with medium to high volume of transactions, especially for cross border transactions, they will do a review of your company by asking for a lot of sensitive information. Waste of our time if you ask me. If you refuse/fail to provide or justify certain transactions without any proof, they will keep calling you and ask for it, and subsequently they may choose to close your account. I have since closed all my accounts with this digital bank and resume transactions with traditional banks...",

This is asking us to essentially break the law by handing over invoices and contacts between our business partnerships which is totally internal business information and confidential. Additionally they've a new clause change that they can share data held to 3rd parties! This is such a security concern! I hope they get thier legal processes and relations with business owners sorted especially legally. They should not be asking for such information nor sharing it to 3rd parties PERIOD.",
