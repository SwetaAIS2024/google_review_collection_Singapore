The surface of the black carrot cake was crispy and the interior soft and very flavorful with black soya sauce and a tinge of spiciness. Every mouthful brought me closer to heaven. I was extremely satisfied. Will come back often from now on.\n\nI enjoyed it so much I forgot to take a photo of the Black Carrot Cake before I completely finished every bit of it.",

      "text": "One of the better carrot cake stalls I’ve had in the east side..very crispy on the outside yet the carrot cake is super tender in the middle. Always wondered why they had such a long queue every morning..Talked to the owner and apparently they make their own Chili and oil (there’s lard inside which isn’t common nowadays since most hawkers fry to cut costs by using vegetable oil instead). And it’s super affordable (starts at only $3) and portions are generous!!\nThis is a MUST try if you’re in the area looking for a good breakfast in the mornings.",

Never tried this before but since we have been looking for good carrot cake to eat after our drone flight, we decided to have a go. Those in the area who are interested in carrot cake should also give it a try. Would go back again to try white one.\nThe aunty works very fast.",

Highly recommended due to generous portion and nice service.  Chili could have more oomph, so if you want to taste chili, please ask for more.  Stall is usually manned single-handedly, so be patient as each order is done separately.",
