Rasyad,3,This is one of the best place I've eaten at.  The only reason I have given this place 3 stars is because of its pricing in relation to it's food. To me I see the the quantity of the food to it's pricing to be not so worth it as the price does not correlate to the food quality.  A reduction of the food prices by $2 could bring in the crowd.  Yeah I know people still buy from your shop however bringing down the prices of the food will really help out in terms of food sales in quantity as this isn't a high class restaurant.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102245824615344086953/reviews
Eileen,3,Ordered cheesy chicken & nasi goreng kampung. Nasi goreng taste not bad. Cheesy chicken can have a stronger cheese taste. Price for western food towards the higher side given the environment,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118258306965720393886/reviews
