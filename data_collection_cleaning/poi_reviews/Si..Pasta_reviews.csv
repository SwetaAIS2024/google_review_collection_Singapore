Their Aglio Olio is amazing‚Äîperfectly cooked pasta with just the right balance of garlic, spice, and fragrance. The flavors are rich, and you can taste the quality ingredients.

YW Lau,5,"This is the first time we tried Si Pasta.

We ordered smoked duck pasta, mixed veg pasta and steak (Medium).

All dishes exceeded our expectations. Very polite and friendly service from the lady who took our orders.

We saw many customers patronized Si Pasta, definitely a good and healthy sign that Si Pasta is doing a good job. Keep it up Si Pasta.

Unfortunately, the atmosphere was not that good due to the flies at Koufu. Hopefully, Koufu and all the stalls will step up the cleanliness of the place so that customers will have a more enjoyable dining experience.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100672887438941772177/reviews
