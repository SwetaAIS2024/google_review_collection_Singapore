Siti Nurain,2,"The food tasted average, but they did not provide the appropriate condiments.

We ordered both of the k-feasts (platter of chicken, cheese and fries and a big bowl of noodles) costing total of 70 plus.

Customer service was very unsatisfactory.
We asked about the food as it was our first time and they didnâ€™t describe their dishes and looked very uninterested.

After we had taken our seats and received our platter, a man came to serve us the big bowl, seeing that our table was full of drinks and the platter, he did not offer to help and instead told us to make room. We had to ask him to bring the table next to us and join it with ours.

Place was empty and now we know why.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113404590255916168464/reviews
Sewfuntastic 2015,3,"Had late dinner with my husband. The staff was helpful with our order as it was our first visit. We were there around 8:30. There was another couple eating their dinner. When the chicken was served, they were not hot at all and the meat was slightly on the dry side. We ordered curly fries while at least itâ€™s hot. We didnâ€™t want to feedback to them coz we might not want to return again. After all, there are a lot of other food we can try in BPP.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100761231073168490139/reviews
