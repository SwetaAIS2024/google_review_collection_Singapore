Jonavan Lee,5,Beautiful place to chill in the evening. The sunset hues with the trees and the backdrop of Our Tampines Hub & the HDB blocks makes it a great photo spot. The concentric grass circles will make a great photo too. This place is open to public 24-7. There are many seats around too so you can just walk your pet here n take a seat while they explore this place. There's a maze garden too. I walk past it regularly but only realized its beautiful evening view nowüòç,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102582766424036554780/reviews
JL Wong,5,I think only few locals realise this is a labyrinth. Many may see it as a maze or random grass pattern. But a labyrinth can be a good place for meditative walks. I believe this is one of the biggest in Singapore. I wish more people appreciate the beauty of this labyrinth :),11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106236570685887223045/reviews
