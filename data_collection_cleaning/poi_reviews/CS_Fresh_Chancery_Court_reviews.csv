Bugwagen,5,"Happy to visit for the first time since it open earlier this year.  Like the calm quiet vibe so we can shop in peace, without the loud music.  Very spacious aisles and the high ceiling makes the air better.  There‚Äôs good variety.  No butchery counter, so the slice meats are in the fridge.  Good that there is free 1 hour parking to pick up groceries üëçüèª",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109071563364310385081/reviews
Touristmouse,5,"Needing last-minute festive groceries on Chinese New Year's Eve, I ventured into the newly reopened Cold Storage at Chancery Court, unsure of what to expect. To my delight, the store was blissfully calm, a welcome respite from the usual pre-holiday chaos.

I was immediately impressed by the wide selection of groceries, including a fantastic array of festive offerings. The aisles were bright, spacious, and easy to navigate, making shopping a breeze.

Bonus perk: A coffee kiosk within the supermarket was a lifesaver, offering a much-needed caffeine boost amidst my shopping spree.

I'll definitely be back soon!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110409011587721664076/reviews
Kar Hoe Zenn Ow,1,"Scary experience at this outlet.

In the past, all the staffs are cheerful and happy to reply with my inquiries, recently these months, they are afraid to talk to people and by their expression, we can tell that they are stressed.

What kind of management would stress front lines to this extent?

Walk across the road, when I visited fairprice finest, the atmosphere is friendly and cheerful, lucky that it doesn't become like you.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103577704449451510027/reviews
Fiona Yap,1,"Rude lady staff. Didn‚Äôt reply me when I asked for help at the self check out and when I repeated my request for help, snapped at me saying she‚Äôs in the middle of something and she‚Äôs the only one there.
A previous time when I asked where to find something, a very unhelpful staff replied, ‚Äúover there‚Äù! Which did nothing to help me locate the item.
Disappointing because the previous staff there before the reno used to be very pleasant and it felt like a warm neighborhood store. Please bring back the old crew!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110424138370030396059/reviews
mark lim,4,"had a bad experience and would like to extend my apologies to the bespectacled burmese man in the hoodie who checked out my groceries. there is one hour free parking, i entered at 2220H, and checked out at 2308H but due to some cashier error, i had to check out a second time at 2320H. unfortunately the one hour free parking grace period elapsed and i was charged $3.50. after haggling and bargaining for 20 minutes, he compensated me with a box of ice cream.
i am so disappointed that there was no petty fund available to resolve the issue simply and quickly. i really hope that the compensation isn‚Äôt out of his own pocket.
plus points, supermarket is quite large and well stocked. ample parking very close to the supermarket doors. good discounts w UOB credit cards",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110435244424149938993/reviews
