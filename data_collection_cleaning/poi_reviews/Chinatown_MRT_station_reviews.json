      "text": "Singapore's Chinatown is known as Niu che shui in Mandarin, Gu Chia Chwi in Hokkien and Ngau-che-shui in Cantonese - all of which mean \"bullock water-cart\" - and Kreta Ayer in Malay (Post-1972 spelling: \"kereta air\"), which means \"water cart\". This is due to the fact that Chinatown's water supply was principally transported by animal-driven carts in the 19th century. Although these names are sometimes used for referring to Chinatown in general, they actually refer to the area of Kreta Ayer Road.",
