Angie K.,4,"Food was amazing, though portions are very small and I was hungry at 12 midnight after the dinner...

We ordered quite a few starters and 2 mains, and must say that the Octopus dish and Prawn Risotto stood out the most. Very interesting flavours and mix of sauces for the Octopus dish! The Prawn Risotto was very flavourful without being too overpowering. However they only served 2 prawns on the risotto which was extremely sad and seemed to be overpriced....

Would come again only if I win lottery + feeling extremely happy because of the price point.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103011875119095675105/reviews
Gary Tan,5,"Visited as a couple, lunch service. Book your seats on level 1! You’ll get to see how the chefs prepare your food. It was a lovely experience.

Friendly staff/servers made good recommendations on the menu.

Each time a dish was brought to us Chef Wei Tse personally introduced the dish himself and made sure we know what we are eating. Every single dish was exquisite and delicious. Uploaded some photos for reference.

Highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117452914473049373838/reviews
Jasper koh,5,"This is gonna be my go to place for Spanish food after today…!

We came as a group of 5 and we loved every single dish we ordered!!!

What I love most and will recommend others has got to be their garlic carabinero prawns, their Hokkaido Paella (which genius decides to add Japanese elements in Spanish cooking!? It can only be Chef Carlos) & lastly the Spanish suckling pig.

The prawns were sweet, plump, succulent, and most importantly super fresh. That head butter from the prawn’s head was also a highlight.

As for the Paella, I just love the creativity of it. To make it look so aesthetically pleasing and to add in Japanese ingredients in it like Hokkaido Uni & Cuttlefish is just brilliant. On top of everything that was mentioned, the paella also has a very rich umami claypot kinda rice & prawns in it too.

Another plus point, I super love it that the suckling pig is based on grams and not sold as just “whole” or “half” where it can easily be $200~$400 & too much to eat.
Over here, it is sold as $15 per 100grams and you can tell the chef how much you wanna eat or for how many pax.

Special mention to their cabbage & cauliflower dish too. Man, it was so delicious, paired so well that I’m sure the vegetarians will be very happy dining here too.

We will definitely come back more often at Esquina!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103969433559486829987/reviews
Gildon Han,5,"Thank you Elwin, the recommendations were great! :)

Started with half a dozen oysters and “pan con tomate”

Top it up with the recommended roasted cauliflower, Spanish octopus and ending with the pork secreto!

Will definitely be back to try their paella",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110142175894842405763/reviews
Ria Rabajante,5,I have been wanting to try Esquina and good thing we did. It’s a Spanish resto with some Asian fusion. Then seafood paella is good and I also love the burrata. Shout out to Alvin for his great service and the other waitress for explaining the food that they serve.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101475530285031969643/reviews
