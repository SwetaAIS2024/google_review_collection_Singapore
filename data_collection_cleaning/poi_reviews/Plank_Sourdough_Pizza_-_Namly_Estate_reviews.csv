Limzy,5,Tucked away from hustle and bustle in Namly Estate. This restaurant is on entertainer app which makes it great value for money. Open kitchen concept where you can watch the food before prepared right before your eyes. Pizza dough was the best I've eaten. Tomato sauce on pepperoni pizza was quite tart/sour. Trio of dips is decent. Child friendly and good service.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116700878853534773356/reviews
Kevin Wang,4,"Went for dinner, super quiet. We sat outside with our dog (pet-friendly). Service was good.

We had pizza only, the dough was Excellent with generous toppings.

Down side: the combination of toppings were odd, not traditional Italian or American pizza. And the overall was too watery, the center of my pizza was soaking wet.

They only offer overpriced organic sodas but  can still have free self-service water.

Maybe I will come back and crave pizza dough. The sides, appetizers and desserts didn't sound appealing so we didn't order.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117851772700908242748/reviews
Choon T,5,"This pizza place is right inside Baker and Cook. It's the same folks as Baker and Cook. Therefore, you can expect good sourdough from them.

The creamy mushroom pasta was tasty, and the pizza was a little charred on its sides, equally delicious as well.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114720035040328969753/reviews
Sze Wee Tan,4,"Located in Namly avenue, this restaurant is part of Bake and Cook. Their sourdough pizzas are unique and soft. We tried the pizzas with Parma ham, salmon and soft cheese. Sides include truffle fries and fried chicken bites. Service can be slow at times when the place is packed but worth a revisit.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101592249541154985921/reviews
Stefan S. T.,1,"A tough slice of pizza!  I arrived at late 8 pm, and no one welcomed me or asked what I wanted to get. After I asked the chef how to order, he finally took my order, despite the fact that he appeared to dislike being there.

The pie was chewier and rougher than I expected, not as delicate as I had hoped (if they intend a Neapolitan-style pizza). The cut into half of the proofed dough and appeared to be struggling to stretch the tough dough. Paid $35 and walked 10+ minutes from the bus stop for... a dissapointment.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117586729962575447109/reviews
