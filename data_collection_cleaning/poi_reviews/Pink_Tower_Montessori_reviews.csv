Dian Ekowati,5,"My four and a half years old has been attending this school for more than six months now. While I also considered another pre-school that I really/equally loved in the area prior to enrolling her here - the deal breaker was because this school offer breakfast and lunch at school in affordable rates (I know - but that really helps for someone like me who gets crazy often with meal planning for toddler). The first few months were rough as she was still adapting to SG (we just moved here), but the teachers and managers were patient and seems to knew how to deal with my daughter's anxiety everyday. My daughter is happily going to school after a couple of months and I now even enrol her for longer hours which she seems to enjoy - which is a HUGE relief for me. The sisters who run the school were also wonderful and informative. I can say that it is a recommended school.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104872660436077977270/reviews

Martyn Shaw,5,"We looked at ten different pre-Schools in the area and there was no doubt. When you know you know! A great school with lovely facilities, very deceptive from the outside!
