Kimberley Foo,5,"Ms Fiona is a very kind and patient podiatrist. She is also very thorough and sharp! My child loves getting treated by her and her foot health has really improved under Ms Fiona.
My child was also undergoing a very tricky situation where she was very sensitive to the pain but Ms Fiona has such a warm and kind bedside manner which made both parent and child feel so at ease! She really goes above and beyond what a podiatrist needs to do. She also managed to spot some problems early and so saved us lots of time and trouble.
It is also very easy to arrange appointments at the Eastgate branch. Thank you for the great service!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114261164193519986301/reviews
Pamela Ho,5,"I can't recommend our podiatrist Sheena enough! I’ve been dealing with a stubborn fungal toenail issue for nearly a decade, and after trying countless remedies and treatments with no success, I finally decided to seek professional help. From the moment I walked in, Sheena’s warmth and professionalism put me at ease.

She took the time to thoroughly explain the condition and walked me through every step of the treatment, ensuring I fully understood what was being done. Her patience, expertise, and meticulous attention to detail made all the difference.

For the first time in years, I feel hopeful about my toenails. Thank you Sheena!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110895639272433351092/reviews

Jonathan Chou,5,"Physiotherapist Farha was excellent, with great knowledge about infant torticollis, tracking the progress of our infant child over the course of several months. She was very present and my wife and I definitely were thankful for her guidance.

Of course, physiotherapy doesn't end at the session here, and Farha give us good exercises to work on our baby, and we could definitely see the progress. Thanks very much.

The clinic receptionists were also friendly and professional.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111410888330115052454/reviews
Manisha Sarkar,5,"Very  nice experience. The therapist is good . She knows her job well and uses  various methods to find and  heal the root cause of the problem . Does not address the issue at surface level only.  The excersizes  and  the therapy seems to be effective and useful.
