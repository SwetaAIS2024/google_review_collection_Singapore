Xdd Shuaige,5,"Not much people on weekdays, peaceful to chill and hangout with friends. Many affordable places to have a good meal with good service at Saizeriya and Yakiniku Like. Miniso nicer than other branches.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118200494995391997118/reviews
Sarah S,5,"Cathay has undergone a revamp and is now looking gorgeous! It has a beautiful massive screen, and the mall’s interior is full of green spaces and high ceilings.

Although it’s just a ‘soft launch’ for now, there are already several F&B outlets open like Tsui Wah, Starbucks, Kebuke, Fore coffee and Saizeriya, with Saboten, Wingstop, Yakiniku, yakun and a basement food court etc upcoming. Unfortunately there is no more cinema, but before the renovation there were already very few cinema patrons, so that’s to be expected.

Excited for what’s to come!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105906873726931387362/reviews
HP Chng,3,"Mall does not have much going on at the moment as it has just reopened. But … Quite a clever idea to move to bring the famous Cathay busker indoors to draw in the crowds. A pity that the acoustics are very echo-ey, which makes it hard to hear the song, or have a conversation in Starbucks",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110104310981166368019/reviews

Gillian Tay,1,"It's like a ghost town, not a friendly welcoming place. I was early for the show, couldn't find any where to sit while waiting for it to start. Both the floors has huge empty space but no seats, such a waste of space, bad planning, all they had was 2 standing tables. I couldn't check out the shops because most are closed. Coming from real estate background this place is not well plan, no good flow/energy. In the cinema, the seats are comfortable but sadly there were only 3 pax watching. Lots can be done for improvement.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107433006403584323144/reviews
