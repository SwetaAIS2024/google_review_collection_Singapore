Furthermore, the stall only accepts CASH and we had to walk opp to withdraw cash instead. Not coming again.....",

Its very generous portion at $7, i cooked pork trotter before so I knew the cost is almost the same or higher , not to mentioned the time needed.\n\nBought 5 recently to each family members.\n\nHighly recommend their black chicken soup, watercress pork rib soup too.",
