Blackraven,5,"Compact yet engaging adventure space perfect for kids. Despite its size, it cleverly incorporates various obstacles, play areas, and climb structures that keep children entertained and happily engaged, allowing them to burn off their boundless energy. Maintained diligently by NParks, the sandy pit surface adds a natural touch and is consistently mosquito-free, safe and enjoyable play environment for kids. For accompanying adults, there are convenient sitting areas available, providing a comfortable spot to supervise while the little ones explore and play. Well-designed and maintained playground, great place!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114385515451710838076/reviews
