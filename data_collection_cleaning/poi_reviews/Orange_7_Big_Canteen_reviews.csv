Dave Poh,3,"Good variety of food. Duck noodles, western food, muslim food are good.
Drinks stall service poor. Pay attention to the cashier machine if you are making large orders, they might sneak in additional charges for items not ordered.

Pauline Wong,1,"New eatery in the area that's newly opened. Convenient and not stuffy. Please avoid the economic rice stall. Overcharging for a plate of one vegetables and one meat. Claims that lotus root is meat. The seller needs to be re-schooled to learn the difference meat and vegetables. The economic beehoon need to avoid mixing of noodles, else there's an extra surcharge of $0.50. Still trying to figure out the feedback of other stalls!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105382588588991115668/reviews
Joseph Ign,1,"Disappointed with the Western stall. Manu pic shows 1 full slice chicken cost $6.50... When serve, was not even half slice of the chop. Ask the stall lady and her answer was ""Display is picture only."" The spagatti not tasty at all. Don't waste time. Try other stalls.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107561259235507004364/reviews
