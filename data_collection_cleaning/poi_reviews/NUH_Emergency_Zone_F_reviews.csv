MrA,4,"My family member was feeling very unwell and the nurses and doctors on duty attended to her promptly upon arrival at A&E. Her face was red and lips appeared swollen. This incident took place on 16 March, Sunday, around 1.05am.

The doctors wasted no time to give her an injection as well as drip. A blood sample was also taken. The treatment was spot on and she felt a lot better after 30 minutes.

She was given a few hours to rest and recuperate in a quiet and conducive environment before she was discharged from the hospital.

So I would like to thank and commend the team on duty that night. I was told that they are all Singaporeans. Keep up the good work! üëçüòä",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112008289267740134602/reviews
Faidzal Nasir,1,"Unprofessional Doctor Derek Quah. I was refered to A&E for referal from NUH Oral department but Doctor was not welcoming, no good morning and even say I am not that emergency.

Gary Pan,4,"Efficient Visit with some Caring Staff

Overall:  My visit to NUH's Emergency Zone F on a Saturday was efficient and positive. Registration, assessment, and waiting time took a maximum of 30-45 minutes, which felt lucky compared to what I've heard.

Highlights:
- Fast Service: The overall process was quick, especially considering it was a weekend.
-A big shout-out to Nurse Jenifer Bedania for her exceptional kindness, attentiveness, and care. She truly made a positive difference in my experience.

Areas for Improvement:
Doctor 1: While the first doctor was pleasant and offered suggestions, his lack of immediate familiarity with my condition felt concerning. (He searched it online in front of me)
Doctor 2: Dr. Balakrishnan, while efficient, had a rather blunt bedside manner. This might not be ideal for everyone.

Other Nurses: Some of the other nurses, particularly a young Indian nurse, seemed inexperienced, complaining about how to open a pack of meds finding it ""very annoying"" (like whut?)

Despite these, my experience at NUH Emergency Zone F was positive. The quick service and Nurse Jenifer's care were much appreciated.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113495714643289127322/reviews
Umar Malik,1,"Poor service. If the gynae is not around yet please inform the patients. Im holding a newborn and my wife is constantly bleeding and we have been waiting for more than 3 hours. Polyclinics might have been faster and cheaper.

THIS IS EMERGENCY, so allocate and shift around staffs well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114901804002194736317/reviews
