Joye Tan,1,"Dr ng Zhi Hao not suitable to be a doctor
I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the teleconsultation I had with Dr. Ng Zhi Hao on [15/03/2025]. Despite paying the consultation fee, I did not receive proper medical attention, and I believe the service provided was highly unprofessional.

During the consultation, I was feeling unwell with a runny nose, and back pain. However, Dr. Ng Zhi Hao did not examine my symptoms properly or provide adequate medical advice. Instead, he was dismissive and rude, failing to conduct a thorough assessment of my condition. This lack of professionalism and care is unacceptable, especially when patients seek medical help in times of need.

Given the poor quality of service and the doctor‚Äôs failure to fulfill his professional duty, this doctor is not suitable to be I believe his doctor cert is beg to be given hopefully u will see this uh",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112057435633969092379/reviews
Jon,1,"Gui Chuanhao this is for you.

‚≠ê 0/5 - If You Enjoy Paying for Others‚Äô Mistakes, This Is the Place for You!

Had the absolute pleasure of consulting Gui Chuanhao at 9:15 PM, who concluded my consultation with a delightful smirk and prescribed me medication without bothering to explain how to use it until I had to literally ask. Fine, no big deal. But here‚Äôs where it gets fun.

I clearly requested an MC for 4th February, only to later receive one dated 3rd February which is, of course, completely useless. Why would I need an MC when the day has ended? When I asked about the prescription delivery, Gui Chuanhao  conveniently shrugged it off, saying he had ‚Äúno idea‚Äù and pushed it to ManaDR. Turns out, they could only deliver it the next day (how helpful), so I decided not to proceed with the order. Coincidentally, right after that, Gui Chuanhao quickly sent me the wrongly dated MC and ended the consult. Almost like a ‚ÄúNo payment? No problem, here‚Äôs an MC you can‚Äôt use! Bye.‚Äù

Fast forward to when I finally realized the mistake. I contacted customer support, expecting a simple fix, only to be told I need to pay for another consultation to correct their own doctor‚Äôs blunder. That‚Äôs right their mistake, my cost. Brilliant customer service model!

If you enjoy getting wrong MCs, zero accountability, and paying to fix errors you didn‚Äôt make, this is definitely the place for you. Otherwise, save yourself the frustration and head to a real clinic that actually values their patients.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105198431845754093199/reviews
