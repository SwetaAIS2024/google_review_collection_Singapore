      "text": "I wholeheartedly agree with their philosophy - good coffee is good enough without sugar (yeah this is kinda paraphrase). The espresso is very flavorful and packs a lot of aroma and pleasant notes (first one was chocolate, followed by dried fruits). The cheese omelette brioche was tasty and pretty filling - surprised there's caramelized onion in it. The price is rather steep for a neighborhood cafe, but still okay for a treat. The folks in the locality are lucky to have such eatery within walking distance.\n\nThere are dining spaces indoor and outdoor - the management went to great length to provide kiddie toys in the patio dining area. There's a small fan too for the diners who choose to have the meal or coffee outside.",

It is next to the laundromat.\n\nStaff are kind and friendly, coffee is good, food is decent. We arrived at 11ish on a weekday and ordered the mushroom mac n cheese and the Sunrise brioche bun ‚Äúburger‚Äù. Personally I preferred the mac n cheese but perhaps Sunrise is good for the morning.",

Ham is just ham, little disappointing.\n\nService is also average. The lady doesn't give me a good vibe. Feels like she just wants u to finish ur food and go.",
