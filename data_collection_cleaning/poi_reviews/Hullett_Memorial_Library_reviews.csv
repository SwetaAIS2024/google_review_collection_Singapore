Ong Hong Hao Jared (Rafflesinst),5,VERY GOOD LIBRARY(if u are a rafflesian),2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112576982823557329602/reviews
Serafinu Dibattfoli,5,"I enjoy this library for its aesthetics. Although it is new built in the 1990s, the interior architecture of the library is very old fashioned. It uses wooden tables and chairs. The carrels are comfortable too, making one enjoy studying alone. You can possibly not find any other libraries with carrels in Singapore.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113402733921065419712/reviews
