Perfect for large weekend family dinner gathering.",

      "text": "We were craving crabs and have heard great things about Uncle Leong - so we decided to give it a try. Absolutely no regrets!!\nThe shimmering sand crab was a clear winner. It was creamy with the right hint of pepper. And that chilli crab! It had the right amount of chilli so the sauce is not too sweet. The meat on both were juicy and plump. For the price we paid, it was truly worth every cent.\nKudos to the service team. Food was quickly served. They were always at the background, changing our plates when things got too messy and were quick to assist us whenever we raised our hands.\nWill definitely be back for more!!",
