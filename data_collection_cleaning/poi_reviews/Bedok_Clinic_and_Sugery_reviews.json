My parent took the stronger medicine and ended up going to hospital (surgery).\n\nThe receptionists also made NO effort to explain each medicine, I had to google whether to consume before or after food (it was before) and their purpose. Labels didnt write either.\n\nThanks to the  clinic for worsening the condition which led to discovering the real issue through hospital CT scan.",

The doctor prescribed only cough medicine and lozenges (orange tablet)The medicine given were at the cheaper range and mild. The staff mentioned they were unable to give better/expensive as I am under IHP. This is my first time receiving such a remark and having one cough medicine and lozenges to bring home.\nConclusion if u are under company payment, do not visit them..",

True enough the doctor arrived an hour after the clinic opened. No respect or care for the many sick patients waiting since 9am and from the reviews, this seems to be the norm rather than the exception. Definitely going to be our first and last time here!",
