      "text": "I asked the stall owner for a recommendation since it was my first time dining here. He suggested the pan-fried dumplings, so I went with that, choosing the pork and chives filling.\n\nThe dumplings were served with vinegar and chili on the side, and surprisingly, the chili paired really well with the pan-fried dumplings. I usually stick to vinegar, but this time I found myself reaching for the chili more often. The filling was also  the filling maximally stuffed. I’m definitely planning to try the boiled version next time.\n\nAnother plus: it's rare to find stalls at Maxwell Food Centre that accept credit cards, but this one does, along with cash, PayLah, and PayNow.",
