      "text": "Love the family like bistro and restaurany here. The Famous kitchen is just beside Hangout bistro under the same management. The owner boss here are very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Most diners and drinker here are the regular customers like a big family. They have many choices of bottle craft beer or you may just have their draft Stella or Black Cab stout (these two are the one for happy hour until 8pm). They serve wines and hard liquor too. Love the vibe and people here. Food from Famous kitchen are very good too, love the roast duck go with beerüòò. Will be back to try their other dishes. Usually the restaurant and bistro will be full on weekend. Book a table to avoid disappointment. Let them know you prefer to have a seat at the bistro or restaurant.",

Must try the cold cockles, dip in generous portions of chili paste. Fried pork in beancurd paste is also very savoury, pair with lots of fried garlics. They also have a lot of live seafood for selection, tried their crab ü¶Ä for few times, always fresh and juicy meat. Special thanks to Lorraine for the great service üëç",
