We kept saying ‚Äòdaebak‚Äô the moment we entered the premises, as it boasts a tropical urban jungle with wooden furniture and rustic setting.\n\nThe highlight of our meal at Tigress - Korean Honey Soy Fried Chicken. Each piece of chicken was perfectly prepared, as it was super delicious on the inside, while crispy on the outside!",

The taste of the foods are really savoury good!We had ordered a few dishes like, Honey Soy Wings, Hawaiian Pizza, etc.\n\nMy kids love the foods too. Even if you are not going for dinner and to chill with friends only. They have quite a number of selected drinks and bites to eat together. And can also go there to booked to play some pool game too.\n\nAnd the service is on point! Kids friendly too!",

It would certainly be quite a unique attraction that makes the most use out of Tigress‚Äô well decorated, light filled space.\n\nThe Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon was decent, but needed just an extra element to make it memorable, and the same goes for the squid rings. The drinks, both alcoholic & non alcoholic, are plenty strong.",

The food is very generous in quantity and beautifully plated. My main was Bulgogi Ribeye Rice Set and I enjoyed it, esp the Kimchi Soup, which wasn‚Äôt too spicy. (The beef was lovely too although it might be a bit too sweet for some). Tigress also uses a pretty nifty cashless payment system, Qashier, which generates QR codes; you just scan and pay. All in all, a great dining experience here.",
