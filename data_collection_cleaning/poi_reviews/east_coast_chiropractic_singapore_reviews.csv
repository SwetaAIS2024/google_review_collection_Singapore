joey chua,5,"I suffered from lower back (caused by degeneration of disc) and other  related (right arm, right leg, knees) pain issues.  Had seen many doctors with different treatment methods to relieve the pain but it did not work for me until I see Dr Greg McRae for consultation for these pain issues.

Dr Greg McRae is professional and he is very  skillful in his chiropractor skills. His effective adjustments had
addressed my pain issues thus I no longer have pain in my lower back, right arm, right leg and knees when  walking and carrying heavy things.  I am very grateful and thankful to him.

Had recommended my friends and family members to Dr Greg McRae and they too had benefited from his sessions.

TJ Woon,5,"A friendly and honest chiropractor.

Being an active person especially lifting heavy stuff, I had developed an uneasiness on my upper back and neck. This matter had persisted for a year and had been harder given the nature of my job of having to sit in front of my wheel for 12 till 14 hours a day which had also caused me to develop a stiff neck. This had caused me to seek a chiropractor to treat my problem. After seeking treatment from Dr. Greg for twice, there is much relieve as the holistic approach he gave which involve adjustments to treat me. All of my problems were gone after the 4th treatment. This clinic is highly recommended for people that are having the same problem as me which involves sports injuries and stiff neck. The price is very reasonable as well given the value that this clinic provides.

Pros:
1. Reasonable pricing
2. Professional treatment (solves all related issues)
3. Strategically located
4. Friendly and honest chiropractor
