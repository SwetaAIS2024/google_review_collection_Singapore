Long time never been back here. This time tried the curry fish head. Priced at $29 and 2 rice at $0.80 each

Big portion and Fish is good. So are the brinjal, lady fingers, tomatoes, tau pok and tau kee.

The curry is flavorful and tasty.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116788322544213433170/reviews
