Di Di,5,"Angel, from the sales team managed to convince me to sign up for the classes despite me having to pay cash upfront. I did not regret as I have really enjoyed myself. The lessons were well-paced. I like how the TV projects what the chef is doing so that learners do not have to crowd at the demonstration table.

Chef Daniel has an engaging personality and he held a respectful attitude towards all learners. Chef Ken worked quietly behind the scene, and he checked on the progress of the batter for each learner. Chef Xin has a jovial personality and is able to handle stress well.

It is hoped that the school can encourage learners to bring their own reusables instead of providing two boxes and a plastic bag for each lesson to bring home the baked goods. There is already is lot of disposables used in a single session for the ingredients.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews

Vivien Leung,5,"Last Saturday, I finally completed all the classes for my first attempt at learning to bake: BAKING CLASS - WSQ CAFE STYLE BREAD, MAKE MUFFINS AND SCONES. Thanks to Chefs Vincent, Ashton, and Carrie for their patience and guidance, as I had no basic training and donâ€™t cook either. I learned a lot, and the chefs made learning fun.
