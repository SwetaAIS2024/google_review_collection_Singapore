She’s been at this outlet for two months, with seven years of experience overall. Her technique is unique and effective, where she use firm, rhythmic pressure on meridian points to release tension and improve energy flow.\n\nShe also took time to understand my pain and tailored the treatment, which really helped with relaxation and relief. Highly recommend her if you're looking for a skilled Tuina therapist with a special touch.\n\nOne area to improve: Consider adding more stretches.",
