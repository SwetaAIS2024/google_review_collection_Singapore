Zan J,5,"The best satay at Adam Corner. Ordered 20 sticks of mutton satay. Thick, chunky and juicy meat. The sauce is thick and sedap.

Ordering and collection process was organised. They have an electronic tag and alerts you to collect when ready. Payment via Paynow was also efficient and seamless.

Superbly Delicious!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112654527023441699665/reviews
Affandi Hassan,1,"Ordered 20 sticks of dine in satay, waited for an hour so i went over to the stall to check the status of my order only to find out that my order was not prepared as the stallholder overlooked.

This experience was incredibly disappointing and inconvenient. I understand that occasional delays happen, but unprepared orders is unacceptable. I could have made alternate arrangements instead of wasting my time waiting.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113066184463025004845/reviews
blackcoupe,5,One of the best traditional Malay Satay Store.   Taste is fantastic and the gravy is heavenly. It's selling for 80cents per stick and minimum order is 10 sticks. They have been at Adam Road Hawker Center for ages. Definitely a hidden gem not to be missed.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117507784141300452476/reviews
Ashim Ahmad,4,"Beef & mutton satay was tasty & come in chunky pieces; I did not try the chix satay. Sadly, they do not sell satay babat. I like the gravy; it was very tasty too. Be prepared to wait more than 15 mins while your order is prepared.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105588295153388150934/reviews
Micheal Foo,5,"This taste of their satay is superb. Both the Beef and Mutton Satay is very tender, juicy and well marinated. Give it a try if you do drop by here. Highly recommended.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100650832613717686387/reviews
