Jimmy Yee,4,"We ordered the Crispy prawn roll,  Yam ring, Salted Chicken,  Spinach With Trio egg, wasabi prawns. Must say the service is good with free flow of chrysanthemum teas. Servings were generous for 4 pax. The yam ring is a bit dry but had lots of scallops. I didn't like the salted chicken as it was too salty. Would order the crispy prawn roll again as it was delicious. Parking was easy. Those who like traditional restaurants and food can give it a try.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107671251157082294798/reviews

Kevin Lim,5,"This vintage restaurant has a long history and is still a beloved part of the neighborhood. The atmosphere is calming, and the staff are friendly. The food is excellent, and the prices are reasonable. I particularly enjoyed the Yam Ring, which comes with a generous portion of scallops for just $30. The Yee Foo Mee in medium size, priced at $16, is also a favorite of mine. Surprisingly the Pao Fan prawn is so big and juicy. I will definitely be back again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106673512036124640849/reviews
Ali OH,4,"A bustling restaurant with lots of birthday celebrations, not a place to go to If you want to have a conversation with people across the table.
Value for money dishes in feneral. Outstanding dishes: Hei Zhou (not typical and surprising), pumpkin prawn, and the bun that came with the pork belly-  soft and fluffy. Coffee pork ribs otherwise just ok.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108197670640251910579/reviews
MrA,3,"There were a few issues raised by my family members. First and foremost, 2 of them discovered plastic tape in the shark fin soup. Their staff apologized and compensated with cold dessert only. Last but not least, the female toilet was very dirty. The flush system was very weak so you can imagine what was the end result.

So I hope the management can take my feedback seriously and review their hygiene in food and restaurant.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112008289267740134602/reviews
