Y W,1,"Food took so long to arrive. Cheesecake was dry. Not sure how long it has been sitting on the shelf.
Burger took half hour yet it was overcooked. Fish and chips took an hour. Honestly what's so difficult about cooking fish and chips. It should have taken 15 minutes maximum. Wouldn't recommend for the long wait and average food.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118297943299005507726/reviews

Deborah Ng,1,"I could give 0 star if I could. Had the shock of my life when I visited this place. They served our food in recycle wooden bowl and cutlery even though we were eating there. When asked why we were not given proper utensils, they said because this is the way for halal and that these cutlery are more expensive than normal?! The bolognese we ordered was just sphaghetti with tomato sauce and the laksa was tasteless. Will never come back here again and will not recommend.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101502588575077086453/reviews
