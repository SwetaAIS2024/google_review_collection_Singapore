The beef was simmered in the sweet teriyaki sauce, but it was grilled longer making it slightly charred. ⁣

Personally feel the size of the salmon is a little bit small in portion. Expecting the skin to be crispy but it’s not. Rice portion a little too much. Not sure if we can request salad instead of rice and sweet corn would be better! ⁣

Both dish are not bad. Will come back to try the other dishes. Also it came with salad and soup! ⁣",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112868994757778796482/reviews
Angel Tan,4,"Tried these Japanese rice bowls by ex-Sushi Tei chefs. Ordered the teriyaki chicken donburi, pork belly donburi, salmon mentai donburi and beef donburi (not pictured). Food was average but probably a good option if you’re in the area.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108844531618530891906/reviews
Edmund Lam,4,Ordered the beef yakiniku and chicken teriyaki. Big portions of rice even if takeaway. The beef yakiniku was better esp with the half cooked egg mixed into the rice. Would have preferred the chicken teriyaki to have a more crispy skin but maybe its the sauce that made it abit soggy,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114244726599482815017/reviews
SEK LEE Lim,5,Stall in within a big canteen at a industrial area. Food is nicer then my expectation. Worth dropping to ta bao if nearby. Stall owner even brought the packed food out to carpark for me knowing that I do not have any proper parking lot while waiting. Buzzer was given as well. Overall happy w my 1st time patronising this stall,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104119432024537845615/reviews
