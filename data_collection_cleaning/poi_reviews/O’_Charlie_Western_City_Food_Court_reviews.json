Food tastes good and large quantity is given.\n\nOne set has the mains, fries, mashed potato and coleslaw (3 sides) which is more than usual western food around, no compromise on the quantity too.\n\nFries is not the usual shoestring fries that tastes cheap but a thicker one and has something like cajun powder on it.\n\nMashed potato is very creamy and thick so it pairs well overall with the fries and main.\n\nBoss was also nice enough to change some sides for me when I called.",
