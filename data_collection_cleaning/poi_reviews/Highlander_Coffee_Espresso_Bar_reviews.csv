Mandy Manyee,5,"I‚Äôm glad to found this place and the sandwich is really fulfilling and different types of bread to choose. A good portion of food with a perfect match with my piccolo latte. Staffs are heart warming and the lady was worried if I might not be able to finish my food, upon serving my sandwich she offered me a box for takeout. ü•∞ Thanks for the good hospitality! Definitely will visit again!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101150552526867083864/reviews

Benjamin Cheh,5,"Small, humble, and a great service from the Highlander that greets you with a smile. The moment I stepped in with my wife, we knew this place would offer something good.

Ordered a Peppery Passion Tuna Sandwich and Gouda BBQ chicken sensation man that names are funky. Love it. The shop atmosphere is great cozy, and the people are nice. Small table, but it serves its purpose very well with a small, nice plant to display and on sales too. The chef originated from the Philippines.

The food came, and I must say it's the texture in the bread crust that mixes well with the ingredients.  Pity that the amount is a bit small for a pricey meal

Can't fill my belly up, but I am happy. The coffee ‚òïÔ∏èÔ∏è is ok but pricey.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112052591067381006366/reviews
SRL,5,"Sandwiches are SUPERB and the bread is 10/10. Had the gouda bbq chicken and it tastes a bit like the kind of sandwich your mom would make when she:

1) really loves you
2) is in a very good mood

Simple, filling, delicious and incredibly satisfying. Big love. Will be back for more.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114007374529301231325/reviews
