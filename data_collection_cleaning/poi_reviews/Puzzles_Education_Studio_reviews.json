I bet she is one of the best teachers in all of Signapore. And I hope in the shows you get back with JianHao ðŸ˜†\n\nEdit: I am so sorry for the misunderstanding. I rated it 5 stars but I gave it 1 star. Anyway I support every step of Deniseâ€™s career. I hope you accept this as an apology for the misunderstanding. And thank you that you are going to tell Denise about the comment. Means a lot.",

Nearing exam season, she never fails to make herself available so that we can have consultations with her even though it could be late into the night. she also makes the learning environment very cozy and allows us to learn in a relaxed space without any pressure or stress. iâ€™m truly SUPER SUPER grateful for a teacher like Denise and iâ€™m really excited to continue with her for As ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª",
