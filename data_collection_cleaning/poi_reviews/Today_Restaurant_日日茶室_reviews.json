      "text": "Stumbled in because the decor caught our eye, and to our delight, we found a First Street Fish Soup stallâ€”one of our favourites! Ordered the chicken rice and it was pretty solid: fragrant, nicely textured rice, and both roast and steamed chicken were delicious.\n\nWe shared a fish soup too, and it lived up to expectations. The drinks stall deserves a mentionâ€”homemade lemon tea, kopi, and even the French toast were excellent.\n\nOnly regret was not getting to try the fried prawn noodles (starts at 5:30pm). Will definitely be back if weâ€™re in the area!",

Very juicy and tender Infact.\n\nWhat brought it down was the Curry Fish Head.\n\nCurry felt watered down, fish could have been fresher.\n\nVery affordable and decent meal.\n\nPro tip - park at Stars of Kovan and walk over.  Donâ€™t bother with the road side parking.",

      "text": "The food is great, I would return if\n- carpark was more convenient\n- the atmosphere is not so warm. Somehow itâ€™s ultra hot, maybe cos itâ€™s corner shop with concrete road all around\n- the queue is too faster and chicken chopping is too. Everyone wastes time with ordering. The cashier also helps with vege and tauge cooking.\n- the tables are more comfortable. Almost half the tables are 5cm away from a step, next to the road. Prepare for accident\n\nHonestly itâ€™s just chicken rice. Just eat elsewhere.",

      "text": "Newly opened within 10minutes of walking distance from Kovan MRT. Used to be a regular coffee shop till they rebranded start of this year. Today Kampung Chicken Rice is the signature here - really authentic and fresh throughout the day. You can opt for a quarter, half, or whole chicken depending on how many dining companions youâ€™re with. I found that half a chicken was just enough to feed about three to four pax. The rice is also incredibly fragrant ; portions just about right. This is a gem of a chicken rice within Kovan I would safely say. The Zi Char dishes can also be ordered from the Chicken Rice stall - not that an extensive menu as compared to your regular zi char stalls but sufficient I would say. Tried their claypot toufu and sambal kangkong - amazingly good. Sambal kangkong is one of the best I have tried around this area - good wokhey and not as salty or oily at all. Prices are also very reasonable!\n\nOther stalls include First Street Teochew and First Street Fried Prawn Noodles - both also reasonably popular amongst the crowd, especially the Hokkien Mee, which took about 25-30minutes to be served. Place is well ventilated and seats are aplenty. There is also a couple of western and breakfast option at the drinks stall which is very wallet friendly, but I have not personally tried it nonetheless. Washroom is also relatively clean.",

      "text": "Tried their kampung roast chicken and zichar, consistent n affordable. But sometimes zichar garlic kai lan portion shrunk, maybe ran outta veg that night? ðŸ˜… Kopi n teh r decent. Price wise they are reasonable, like $5.80 for chicken rice, $1.50 for teh/kopi, $8 for a plate of kailan and $7.50 for chicken cutlet with rice.\nTheir hokkien mee ($6, $8 & $10) got improvement in terms of taste, ate in Feb, wok hei is rather lacking, (see pic with prawn = 1st try). Then March, their hokkien mee \"zup\" tastes thicker with abit of wok hei, saltier for sure. Jus make sure to tell the cashier to go easy on e chilli. Coz I told her chilli abit..she went on to put alot. When I said stop she jus piak one more scoop! Best to separate e chilli out coz it really makes the dish way too salty. Appreciate the opening hours till late. I stay ard the area, after evening jog still got zichar available.",
