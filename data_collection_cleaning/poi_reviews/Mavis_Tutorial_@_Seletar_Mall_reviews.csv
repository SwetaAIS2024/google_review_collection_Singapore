Samantha Qiu,5,"I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Ms. Joyce, the manager at Mavis, and all the teachers for their incredible support of my child, Tat Yuan, and our family.

I had the chance to speak with Ms. Joyce about my child, who had been struggling with low self-esteem and was reluctant to seek any form of help. Ms. Joyce reached out to him at just the right time, speaking with him and encouraging him to attend the tuition classes.

After each class, Ms. Joyce took the time to communicate with him, helping to strengthen his relationship with us. There were even times when she accompanied him home. She also made a point to call him before each class to remind him to attend.

Now, Tat Yuan is willing to go to his tuition classes at Mavis, and this positive change is entirely due to the support and care of Ms. Joyce and all the teachers.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117279337139501284256/reviews
