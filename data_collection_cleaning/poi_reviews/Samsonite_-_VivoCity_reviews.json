      "text": "Came here to look for a luggage on a weekday morning where it was empty. The 2 older female staff here have no basic knowledge of the luggage and couldn't answer my questions about the material or services provided. Was keen on the Proxis luggage but the staff didn't know what \"made of Roxkin\" meant and even told me wrong info about the free personalisation provided. They even told me to find the info myself online- which I did later and one of them did not know what \"personalisation\" was.   Please train your staff to have basic info on your products- I don't know what they are getting paid for. Would have given 1 star if not for that they were not rude.",
