TJ Pangy,5,"Excellent Service and Professionalism!

This is my second time patronizing L S Tyres & Automotive, and I have nothing but good words for their service.

I was informed by my car servicing technician that my tyre needed replacement due to wear and an unrepairable puncture. After finding a suitable set of tyres from L S Tyres, I made a call, and within 10 minutes, we had arranged for me to head down to their workshop.

Upon arrival, I witnessed a team of highly skilled technicians working swiftly and professionally to replace my tyres. Their efficiency, expertise, and attention to detail were truly commendable. The entire process was smooth, and I left feeling assured that my car was in good hands.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for quality tyre services with top-notch customer care!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117016508552636538860/reviews
Ken Kish,5,"Been a customer for more than a decade. Every aspect of their service and offering has never let me down. From forged rims to Taiwan rims. Even the Japan rims are awesome. Their turn around to variety is awesome!

Tried purchase at other places but Everytime I still come back to them. Daniel & Kelvin runs a tight ship.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107223606736560838061/reviews
Jeremiah Su,5,"Not out to cheat money!

Went there for a rim and tyre change because of a punctured tyre, and they were very honest in their feedback and even gave me a way cheaper option based on what I needed and what I wanted.

Overall changed 4 rims and tyres at only SGD 1500, which is very reasonable and affordable.

Would return!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112933973478443365951/reviews

JJ C,5,"Visited to replace my worn car tires to Michelin Primacy 4ST. Straight forward deal and price was reasonable. They also advised me on getting wheel alignment done, and pointed out my worn brake pads and wheel nuts (all legit need) which i gladly replaced. They were also very kind to help me remove my worn suspension stopper at my request. Tires done nicely and helped to clean the rims and shine the tires (will add a photo soon). Lady boss was still very active and hands-on, coming over multiple times to check the work and it was a joy chatting with her. Happy to see her still strong and agile.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101794881045036287328/reviews
