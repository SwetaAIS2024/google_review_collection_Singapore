Yen Lee,5,"Excellent food paired with friendly service at this stall which offers a combination of Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine.

The ban mian broth is hearty while the noodles are al dente, and the Vietnamese grilled pork noodles come with a generous helping of tender pork, vegetables and herbs for a refreshing meal.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107950494790116132485/reviews
