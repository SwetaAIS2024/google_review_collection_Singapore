Kardem Kiter,5,"Koke SG has such a wonderful array of lush, beautifully crafted kokedamas. I have just ordered my second plant baby.

The quality of their work is outstanding. Each kokedama is a unique piece of art, meticulously handcrafted with attention to detail. The plants are healthy and thriving, a testament to the care and expertise that goes into each creation. I was particularly impressed with the variety they offer ‚Äì from delicate ferns to gorgeous orchids, there's a kokedama for every taste and space.

Kristen, the owner, is knowledgeable and passionate. She took the time to explain the care instructions for each plant, ensuring I felt confident in maintaining their beauty at home. Her love for what she does shines through in every conversation and every kokedama she produces.

In summary, Koke SG is a gem for plant lovers and those seeking a unique, green touch for their space. Their commitment to quality, customer service, and sustainability is commendable. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a special, handcrafted plant display. Five well-deserved stars!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114572755383524430354/reviews
