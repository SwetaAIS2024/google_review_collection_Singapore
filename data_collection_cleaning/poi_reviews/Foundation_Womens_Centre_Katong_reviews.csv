Nellie Gan,5,"I found this women’s clinic purely by chance while frantically searching for a female OBGYN—and I’m so glad I did. Dr. Lee W.Y.’s profile came up during my search, and from the start, the experience was reassuring.

The staff were incredibly helpful, especially with my insurance enquiry, even though the clinic wasn’t on my insurer’s panel. I appreciated that there was no pressure to proceed—they were informative and respectful of my decision-making process.

Dr. Lee is a truly pleasant doctor. She patiently addressed all my concerns and questions, showing both professionalism and genuine care throughout the entire procedure. I felt heard, supported, and well taken care of. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102192966959691708959/reviews

chu k,5,"I visited here today, and both the receptionist and Dr. Lee were very kind and professional. A lot of women's clinics I've been to before tend to overcharge and rush through consultations, but Dr. Lee was meticulous and genuine. In addition, since I'm not a native English speaker, it was not easy to understand medical terms. However, Dr. Lee explained everything in an easy-to-understand way and treated me kindly, like a child. I truly appreciate it. I'm glad to have found a nice women's clinic in sg!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105303778674412134435/reviews

Marliyn Garciano,5,"I recently went to Foundation Women’s Centre for gyne screening. Dr Lee was friendly and did my Pap smear (HPV test) with such skill, that I felt no pain at all. I also had ultrasound pelvis done and I was able to view my scan real-time while Dr Lee explain my scan in detail. The team was efficient that I received my test result within a week. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100391365680175559494/reviews
