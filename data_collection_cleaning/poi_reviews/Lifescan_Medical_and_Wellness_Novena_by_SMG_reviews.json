Started reading the reviews of this place only now while waiting (my bad) and it seems there has been quite a history of long waiting times and disorganised staff reviews, unfortunately I am now experiencing this for myself. Don’t take more appointments than you can handle, stop being GREEDY, it is not going to help your reputation! Patients don’t want to pay private consult prices and be treated like we are asking for free services. Certainly won’t be recommending this clinic and won’t be coming back ever.\n\nUpdate: Blood test nurse finally calls me in after I went to counter to ask what was going on and the nurse tells me he was just called down to draw my blood no doubt after I had went to counter to ask about my turn. So it appears they were so disorganised that they had forgotten about me.",

The place is clean and modern. 2 stars for those two aspects.\n\nCons: similar to other reviews, the waiting time here is incredibly bad. Please expect 1 hour waiting around with zero update from the staff before your scan, and another 20-25 mins for them to settle your payment/report after your scan. Took me 2 hours in-and-out for one pelvis ultrasound..\n\nI’m surprised the management has not addressed this scheduling issue at all that clearly is driving down the reviews.",
