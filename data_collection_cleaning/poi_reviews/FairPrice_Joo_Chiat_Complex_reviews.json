There are corners you have to turn inside the store because of its structure. What brought back memories was the tiled staircase inside the store that brought you up to the second floor. It's like a treasure trove. A niche here for snacks, a grove there for drinks. If you can't climb the stairs, you have a lift, and forget the large trolleys, they don't exist here.",
