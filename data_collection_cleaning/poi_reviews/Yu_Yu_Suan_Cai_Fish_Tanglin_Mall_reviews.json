      "text": "What we had\n🌟 𝐘𝐮𝐘𝐮 𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐭, $𝟏𝟖.𝟗𝟎\nTheir signature suan cai soup base. It’s not overly sour nor oily. You can choose to top up ingredients like vege, mushrooms, meat etc. Their original soup comes with black fungus, bamboo shoots and glass noodles. We picked grouper to go with this soup base. Personally felt the grouper is a bit overcooked and dry for our liking tho\n\n🌟 𝐓𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐨 𝐒𝐡𝐮𝐢 𝐙𝐡𝐮 𝐅𝐢𝐬𝐡 𝐒𝐞𝐭, $𝟏𝟓.𝟗𝟎\nI actually prefer this soup base. It’s not too tangy and doesnt have a super strong tomato flavour which may be off-putting to some people. We picked snakehead fish which is more tender and smoother compared to the grouper\n\nSides\n🌟 𝐌𝐚𝐩𝐨 𝐓𝐨𝐟𝐮 𝐏𝐨𝐭, $𝟏𝟑.𝟗𝟎\n🌟 𝐂𝐮𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐝, $𝟒.𝟗𝟎\n🌟 𝐒𝐩𝐢𝐜𝐲 𝐏𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧, $𝟏𝟎.𝟗𝟎\n🌟 𝐋𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐩𝐲 𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐤, $𝟖.𝟗𝟎\nEnjoyed the mapo tofu here which has a slight spicy kick and the refreshing and crunchy cucumber salad. The poached chicken is a little dry and the crispy pork could be crispier and have more seasoning\n\nDessert & Drinks\n🌟 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐆𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐤𝐞 (𝟓𝐩𝐜𝐬), $𝟓.𝟗𝟎\n🌟 𝐁𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐒𝐮𝐠𝐚𝐫 𝐈𝐜𝐞 𝐉𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐲, $𝟑.𝟗𝟎\n🌟 𝐏𝐨𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐫 𝐋𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐓𝐞𝐚, $𝟐.𝟗𝟎\n🌟 𝐏𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐋𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐓𝐞𝐚, $𝟑.𝟗𝟎\nThe fried glutinous rice cake is soft and stretchy with brown sugar filling, we like this 😁 The brown sugar ice jelly is also quite refreshing and not too sweet\n\nFor more food reviews, follow me on\nIG: @dtfoodaffair :)",

Also tried the noodles, comes with rich soup and fresh fish chunks! There’s free flow of side dishes like braised peanuts and pickled vegetables. Service is very friendly! Will return for more!",
