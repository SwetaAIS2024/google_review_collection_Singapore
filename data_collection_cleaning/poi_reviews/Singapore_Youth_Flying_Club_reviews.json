Good memories and friends were made here.\n\nInstructors are ex-RSAF so they'll give you a taste of how they teach stuff in the air force. One tip I have is to lower your instructor's headset volume before taking off.\n\nBeing a government-linked organisation means it has to adhere to a budget like the SAF and civil service. Which you can see with their old computers that they use for teaching and barely-functioning aircon in the planes. \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\" is manifested in the equipment and infrastructure of the club.\n\nNot that it's a bad thing though. As a student you just need to pay for 2 polo t-shirts and a booklet. The rest is free!",
