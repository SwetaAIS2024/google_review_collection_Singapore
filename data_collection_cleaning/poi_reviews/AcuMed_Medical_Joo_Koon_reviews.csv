Irwan Omar,5,"First time coming here on 3/12 for my ear test. Luckily my company booked an appointment for us for the test. If not you have to wait. Salute to a lady whoâ€™s doing so called a one man show in the clinic. She has to do the registration, the paperwork , sheâ€™s the one who did the test for us. Just WOWâ€¦ A very strong lady indeedâ€¦ still she can put on a beautiful smile during that busy time. A very dedicated lady she is. Thank you Mamâ€¦ I admire your dedication.ðŸ«¡",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109013285045552093675/reviews

Akbar Ali Syed Masood,5,"The counter staff Ms Shamala is exceptionally very efficient and  during my observation while wating for my name to be called,  i noticed she handles all patients needs very professionally. Her ability to converse in Mandarin language was very useful for China nationals workers and speaks Tamil and English very well. She is also very polite and helpful. Wishing her the best for her career!!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107768212483740868771/reviews
