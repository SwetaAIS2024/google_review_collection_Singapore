angel,5,"The food and atmosphere were good, and the song selection was quite wide even if I wasnâ€™t able to search up some songs/artistsðŸ˜…

The service was good as well, before the session ended thereâ€™s a friendly reminder of how many times is left before the session officially ends.

It is exactly like the reviews Iâ€™ve seen on here before going and it is expected. However, I do think it is much more affordable to go there between the time range of 12pm to 6pm as after 6pm or a few mins before 6pm the price would increase and no offers will be availableðŸ¥¹

Will come again on another time",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107050471915711177077/reviews
Sky,5,"This karaoke is conveniently located at Seah Street (Hotpot Street) so before or after singing , you can eat to your heart content. The room are all nicely decorated with futuristic feel and sound effects isnâ€™t too bad as well. Just lack the standing mike n stage which will otherwise makes it better . Price at $20/pax for 2 hour session",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100770304576606473090/reviews
T greensake,5,"Spent 5hrs here on 17/7/24, was a good experience. Staff was polite and friendly. Beer/Stout charged at $15.90++ per bottle was expensive in my humble opinion. Sound system was good, room was clean and nice. Only 1 common toilet on level 3.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
Kristine Peh,2,"Overall the atmosphere and room are fine. However will advise to eat first beforehand as the food are actually from ordering platform delivered to the venue, all in disposable containers and nothing like what you see on the IG photos which is going around. That was indeed pretty misleading to consumers. Also we booked the place for 4 hours and at 3.5 hrs our system hang and stalled. When we went to the reception, the staff told us it was because one of us went to pay and due to system, it will auto re-boot......I guess they should inform us of that beforehand???

Guess it will be our first and last time there. Price aren't cheap also for weekend so we would spend it at other KTV venue.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117439470793255426625/reviews
Mark Seah,3,"Food is only so so, it's better to eat outside before ktv start. Service is fairly good, nothing to complain about, since it's just singing session, how complicated can it be for services? Atmosphere is great but room has way too much echo to my liking, and it's not something that can be adjusted on systems....Overall is fine, not too bad, but if you want more value for money, look elsewhere. Rates are not cheap!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112288070648258543750/reviews
