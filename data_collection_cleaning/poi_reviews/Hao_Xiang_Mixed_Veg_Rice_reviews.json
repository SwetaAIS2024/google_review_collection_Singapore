Suspect they put up the normal side for takeaway and covered the ‘bad’ side. I think it was bad ethics and they shouldn’t have kept the fish if it was burnt.",

The selection quite good but quality hit and miss, eg. the prawn fritters looked and tasted overnight as there were so much oil retention in the batter, possibly due to 2nd frying. But for such comprehensive selections, you do not expect every dish to be on point.",
