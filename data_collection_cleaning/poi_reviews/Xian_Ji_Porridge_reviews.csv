CK Leong (Ah Leong San),5,"This porridge used to be in a coffee shop in Eng Hoon Street in Tiong Bahru but had moved out for at least two years. Now it’s inside 107 Coffee Shop at blk 107 Jalan Bukit Merah. This block is way inside the estate accessible from either Jalan Bukit Merah or Lower Delta Road. I love their fish belly porridge which I usually add in fish slices and vegetables. Yes. This porridge stall has vegetable to add in. The other porridge I love is the mixed meat porridge which has pork balls, liver and small intestines. That porridge I’ll eat the most once two months or more. Why? The liver is cooked just nice so it’s quite bloody inside but really yummy. Yes the prices may be higher here but the quality is always consistent.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101404745364837139891/reviews
C K Leong (Ah Leong San),5,"This is the popular Xian Ji Porridge that was inside the coffeeshop across Tiong Bahru Bakery along Eng Hoon Street. Now it’s here still serving good old Cantonese porridge. So if you’re looking for it, now inside a coffeeshop at Blk 107 Jalan Bukit Merah. It has been relocated to 107 Coffeeshop at Blk 107 Jalan Bukit Merah. So if you’re looking for this really good porridge place go there. I love the thick fish slices, watercress and minced meat balls. Of course the smooth and creamy porridge.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108882315597576503809/reviews
CK C,3,"This small Cantonese porridge stall is located at a corner in the Thai restaurant Little Elephant. It starts selling porridges with fish slices, pork and pig innards early in the morning until they are sold out, usually by 10am. The two aunties manning the stall are friendly. The porridge was OK but not exceptionally good in terms of taste and generosity in ingredients. Each bowl with one added ingredient (eg. egg, century egg, watercress) was about $7. Do note that prices are not indicated anywhere. Nonetheless, a pleasant place to relive the old vibes.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
