Kelvin Tay,2,"Was one of the school for consideration but seeing how this many school bullying happened every now and then, teachers rude attitude and biasness, it might have taken roots in the school cultures. ‰∏äÊ¢Å‰∏çÊ≠£‰∏ãÊ¢ÅÊ≠™„ÄÇAdmin a bit blur but still gets things done. Unlike other school also in my consideration saying things like taking pride for their friendly admin but send 6 emails no bloody body reply. All School have their problem but this bullying culture seem to be worse amongst them.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109093096409977575806/reviews

Arielle,1,"quite bad actually my old class was very toxic racist judging ppl constantly and I was so happy when I graduated I couldn't even trust my friends back in my primary school I was bullied often back in hrps and like even very small things ppl will judge you everything was good until P4 after P4 all of the class is so toxic racist last time when I try to voice out my own opinions ppl will judge me and they'll rudely disagree with me and sometimes bully me about my opinions I really hated my old friends and classmates teachers is okay tho kinda mid but yea I can't describe how bad my class was and especially the boys right they're so racist and then they constantly judge I had a hard time enjoying the school last time especially the cca also everyone was so toxic during the syf when I was practicing the teachers were screaming 24/7 I almost cried everytime I go inside cca I can't even bear a second in my old cca everyone was so toxic even my friends and all and now seriously hrps students are really so damn toxic I was crying with joys when I finally graduated from that hellish school I'm in my new secondary school everyone is so kind and so friendly hardly anyone is racist Soo summerising hrps the students are rude racist and very toxic don't enroll your child in there and a few more things the teachers are also kind of rude also toilets are very dirty during recess it'll be alot of students fliming TikTok inside this and there the water cooler is quite dirty also toilets always smells and some of the teachers is very bias one so many bad memories the teachers most of them are rude but some are nice only some the teachers will scream at us when we forget something even when the teacher doesn't remind us so often like forgetting to bring a mother tongue book in the morning they'll scream at you and make you stand and they're some untrained teachers üíÄ
I think most of the teachers are really unfair and unreasonable when they're in a bad mood they will vent it on the students so many times happening and right my school last year got like quite a few police cases and overall I heard some people got vape thats what I heard from the displine master I didn't had a good childhood in hrps and right in P5 I was hated in class just bc I was very hyper extrovert I try to talk to them nicely and I texted alot in the gc cause I was trying to interact and P6 I had to change my personality cause if I stay as a extrovert and try to interact with them I would be bullied and everyone would hate me so I had to change from extrovert and introvert overtime when I try to answer questions about like work subjects and the whole class wld be hating on me just because I cannot understand when I was like P5 right I ask the teacher to elaborate on the question and the students all ganged up on me and say ""this is so easy why can't you solve"" blah blah blah ever since then I never asked questions in class ever again when I was P5 I was hated on my personality cause I was too extrovert and hyper and wanting to talk during P6 I forced myself to be an introvert if not I'll get constantly bullied and hated To parents don't even think of bringing your children inside this school unless you want your child to get verbally insulted by teachers and many bullying cases students making alot of noises in class high chance of your child getting bullied by teachers or students or maybe both thank you for reading",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117094264561795888474/reviews
