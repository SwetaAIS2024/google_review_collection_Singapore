Jeremy Wen,2,"After a couple of failed attempts to dine here, finally got the chance! Especially looking forward to it as they were supposedly the previous Charcos where I loved the beef and lamb ribs with the choices of delicious sides. Even the double patty beef burger with fries at an affordable price. Would drive (with colleagues in tow) out of my way just to eat at Charcos @ AMK back then.

Ordered beef and lamb ribs, corn dog and spaghetti. Alas, to my dismay.. it was way off. The meat was tough and the sauce was mediocre. The sides were ok but not enough of a saving grace. Corn dog looked like boiled sausages with sauce and mayo.

Good to try once so I know never to dine here again.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117963468637237496828/reviews
Zachary Liew,1,Ordered chicken chop and saw the chicken being MICROWAVED. Came out dry and hard. Hot sides were cold. Portion is small. Expected way more for something that is almost twice the price of regular hawker western food elsewhere.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793290985804544576/reviews
Hazli Din,4,"Great food. Choices for half portion or full portion for some items. Ordered Creme Potato, Fish & Chips, Beef burger & Beef Ribs.

Potato Creme and The ribs is to go for. All we ordered doesnâ€™t really fail, and the price to portion is great.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118256794522848450532/reviews
James Arthur,5,"The lamb ribs here are super well marinated and delicious. Itâ€™s in fact better than some top restaurants Iâ€™ve been to. I highly recommend the ribs here, succulent and delicious ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100564786397841654664/reviews
Derevor De.,4,"Talk to the staff before ordering on expectations. I shared the lamb ribs full portion with my wife and it was really nice! Coleslaw was awesome too!

I saw a review here on the beef ribs which was bad. Indeed it was! BUT why I'm putting a review here is due to the fact that, I gave a direct feedback on how tough it was to chew to the staff and he was very sincere to rectify by forgoing the charge.

But I insisted to pay as it's just business and hope that others will not suffer the same fate. In the end he gave a discount.

I believe they'll be better next time and I'll try their beef ribs again!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114983183149059642835/reviews
