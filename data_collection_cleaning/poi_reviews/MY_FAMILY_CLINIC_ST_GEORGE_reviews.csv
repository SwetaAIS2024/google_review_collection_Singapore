Zach,1,Called in to make an appointment and the clinic staff was extremely rude and giving contradicting information. I don’t think it’s safe to visit the clinic if the clinic staff does not provide accurate information and giving an attitude with rude tone over the phone. I will rather travel further to a clinic where I feel safe and comfortable to get treatment.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102092268693107701371/reviews

colin chamberlain,5,"Best GP clinic we have used in Singapore. Reception staff were friendly and helpful, that alone makes it truly remarkable. Dr polite, not patronising and genuinely interested. I am torn between recommending this clinic too highly as I don't want it to get too busy!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108629901592820678894/reviews
