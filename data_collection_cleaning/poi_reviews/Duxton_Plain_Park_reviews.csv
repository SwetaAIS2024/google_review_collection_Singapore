Forest BK,4,"Duxton Plain Park connect New Bridge Road to Yan Kit Road.
It's like a park connector connecting both roads.
This neighbourhood linear park provide a quiet retreat to the hectic city life.
The short but shady path leads to an underpass crossing over the busy Neil Road above.
Strangely, there is a Keramat placed by the side of the greens along this Park.
The Park was built on the land of a former Railway line which operated from Tank Road to the wharves of Tanjong Pagar.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews

Khuresh Faizullabhoy,5,"Walked down this narrow, tree lined, green path flanked by the Duxton shop house eateries - exiting at Duxton Plain Park! It was a peaceful/serene walk in the heart of bustling Duxton. Some of the shop houses are painted in eye catching colours. Came across a strange sight .. a solitary Muslim tomb on the grasswayâ€¦ which seems to be frequented by believers (I read later that it is believed to hold special powers)!!

A short but interesting walk.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107127417752124757278/reviews
Ice Qu,5,"There is such a pleasant neighborhood vibe at this park. Great for exercising, people watching and even just sitting down to rest. You'll find exercise stations with fun things to keep you fit. There are swinging benches and shady or sunny areas. A very nice link through neighborhoods.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112472682452415767759/reviews
