Crispy outside soft and chewy inside. The best is the salted egg b&p... Will come back again to try other dishes.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114079358438106251869/reviews
Ken Peh,1,"Ordered fried rice with Sunny side up for lunch, costing at $5.80 (Fried rice at $5, sunny side up at $0.80). The taste was ok, but it's a little oily though. However, giving a one star rating. The lady at the counter taking orders probably had a bad day. She frowned and made some tsk tsk gestures when I requested for cashless payment. As a paying customer, we deserve better service albeit the good food from the outlet.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
S K,1,"Please be careful when purchasing from Fu Xiang seafood stall here. The lady at the seafood counter stall will over charge you, make sure you double check how much first. The price on the menu and what she tells you will be different. When you ask her she gets angry.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110240732742661818184/reviews
