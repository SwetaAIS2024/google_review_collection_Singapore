      "text": "A small and delicate pancake eatery at the blk 4a jalan batu hawker centre. The store is at the inner row of the hawker centre which makes it a bit invisible at least for first timers. The store offers pancakes of various flavours, including red bean, sesame, peanut, peanut butter, coconut, cream. Peanut butter and coconut are 1.3 for one piece and all others are 1.1. If you buy 10 pieces there is a discount iirc. The taste is really nice, the portion is also decent. I frequented here and usually buy three pieces for lunch (or two for late breakfast). My favourite flavour is definitely peanut butter!!!",

      "text": "Stumbled upon a hidden gem at Jalan Batu Hawker - stall selling peanut pancake with peanut butter. While peanut pancakes are quite common, finding one generously slathered with peanut butter was a nice surprise.\n\nWhen placing my order, I was greeted by a super friendly uncle who offered me to add more peanut butter for me. However I did not go for it as my mum could not eat too sweet stuff. Nevertheless, the pancake was still very shiok which my mum and I enjoyed very much.\n\nI will definitely be back for another round of this delectable delight the next time I go Jalan Batu Hawker",
