Jeremiah Chia,5,"Highly recommend Dr Kenneth! Very experienced, which was what drew us to him in the first place. Thereafter over the course of the past many months, we became familiar with his warm and friendly personality, I think it helps we both support the same football club ðŸ¤£.

Waiting time for consultation was never an issue, very well planned appointment timings and consultations never felt rushed.

Thank you Dr for all that you have done for my wife, smooth op and delivery. Writing this to show my appreciation for what you have done. God bless you richly in your works and continue to shine brightly for your patients!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104040460511064138991/reviews
Stella Tan,5,"Delivered my first with Dr Kenneth and it was a smooth recovery - will be delivering my second one with him as well. He is reassuring and even when I chose to go to KK for subsided tests at the start, he was understanding as well. Every visit is a breeze and Iâ€™m happy to engage him again as my Gynae to deliver!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111583553157683303693/reviews
Stella Jean,5,"Delivered number 1 and 2 smoothly under the care of Dr Kenneth Edward Lee. His chill demeanour makes every check up session enjoyable and stress free. Any queries we had were also answered during each consultation. Ending each session with small talks about life was also very much welcomed. It was heartening to know that he remembers his patients despite (in my case, 4 year break) Hence, visiting him again for No. 2 was like a walk in the park.

Our two kids were under the direct care of Dr Rhonda Watt from birth. She is very approachable and cares a lot for our kids. Other than being knowledgeable and proficient in her field, she shares her own experiences and tried-out methods to help ease our stress and troubles as new parents. We often enter the clinic with doubts and uncertainties but exit with more confidence and positivity about our kids and ourselves as parents. She is very assuring and encouraging. Definitely a go-to paediatrician!

We truely appreciate all the help, support and encouragement we've received from Maternity and Gynaecological Clinic Mount A.

We highly recommend new parents to consider Dr Kenneth Lee and Dr Rhonda Watt! :)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110249624538364825048/reviews
