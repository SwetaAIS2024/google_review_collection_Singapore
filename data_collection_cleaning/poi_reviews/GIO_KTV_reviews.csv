The up-to-date song system allows you to belt out all the latest hits from their extensive library, making it a fantastic experience for everyone. Their sound system also is a top tier !‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

not only that they also serves food and drinks to you. From the refreshing Fizzy Grapefruit Citrus Vitamin C to the mouthwatering Mix Popcorn Chicken, Chicken Yakitori, and the Mix Platter (which was a birthday special and free for birthday customers!),

the variety and quality of the food are impressive. The service is top-notch, with dishes delivered right to your room, adding to the overall convenience and enjoyment.
