      "text": "Small Thai resto thatâ€™s big on taste! Authentic tasting Thai food tucked away in Bukit Timah Plaza. We found a seat immediately at around 6pm but a few minutes later, there was a queue. Food came quick and service was alright - canâ€™t complain.\nFor spicy dishes like tom yam soup, you can specify the level of spiciness. Normal is pretty spicy if youâ€™re not into chillies. More spicy means you might have tom yam shooters later ðŸ˜….\n\nLoved the taste of the red ruby desert but the ice was pretty rough.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this place for your Thai food fix.",

I ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice, Tom Yum Seafood Clear Soup, Grilled Pork, and Kailan with Oyster Sauce. The grilled pork was the best, and the rest were okay. Overall, good but not wow.",

      "text": "Lunch on a Sunday at 13:00 - quite busy, nearly all tables taken, most are in the Mallâ€™s concourse rather than inside, so it lacks that â€˜cozyâ€™ restaurant feeling being very open. We had rice with Thai basil and minced chicken (krapow), with a perfectly fried egg on top, fried chicken wings (crispy) and the beef noodles (a lot of beef brisket and tendon and a big ball of noodles). Possible to get boat noodles in a few places around Bukit Timah and Beauty World cheaper than this, but the amount of noodles and meat makes up for it. Soup not too sweet or not too spicy, best to ask for the condiments if thatâ€™s how you want it.\n\n[Photos from May 2025 of larb (spicy good!), cabbage with egg and crab (filling, excellent), prawn cakes (plump!) and the pad Thai (just right!).]",

Best eaten while itâ€™s fresh out of the oil. We also had the pineapple fried rice which was tasty. Thai milk tea was not overly sweet. There might be a wait during peak times but worth the wait!",
