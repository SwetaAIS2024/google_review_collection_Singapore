@ Tampines Mart outside make shift stalls.
5 Tampines Street 32.

My last mission delivery of TKD apparels ended here, where I taken a break to “flower 🌺 leg 🦵“ (aka look look 👀 see see; window shopping) with eventual buy of food :

Menu :
1. Ramly Burger 🍔 of Beef 🥩 & Chicken 🐓, the answer to MacDonald ! @ $4.50/ each.

2. Vadai - Prawns 🦐 + Ikan Bilis 🐟 Costs $1.30 each, with 2 free green chillies 🌶 🌶

3. Thai Milk tea 🧋: The original + Earl Grey version. Each costs $3.00  w/ black Pearl.

4. Fish Otah : 5pcs @ $3.50

Total : $20.10.

This short walk around the make shift stalls brought back many fond memories of yesteryears where food stalls then were “not cleaned” from hygiene stand point and now these stalls are licensed to operate and Pasar Malam is back to our heartland for residents to take a break from Malls and to enjoy family stroll too !

I supported these Pasar Malam (Aka Night Market) Stalls pretty much as life can be hard at times when it rains ☔️ and lives can be hard too ; just like our Hawkers too ! Tough !

Saying :”when the going gets tough, the tough gets going” May the strength 💪 be with them always ! Eke-ing a living is getting tougher each day with rising costs and inflation … 😱😯

So, come and rendered your fullest support to these Pasar Malam stalls : be it food or selling gadgets or pillow/ bedsheet/ bags or even plants 🪴!

Mid Week Cheers
