José Jose,5,"Any foreign come Jurong for breakfast must try this out,  super value old school taste,  nasi lemak chicken wings $3, Soto ayam $3 , Mee rebus $3 , these my order today, they also offer Mee Siam, Mee or Mee hoon Soto,  gado gado  and not to be miss they famous longtong for breakfast, Asam pedas,  sotong goreng, sambal goreng, fried fish with samba , varieties of veg for brunch. They open almost everyday but avoid Friday praying timing cause many ppl all around from nearby estates and industrial company will come over. But not to worry, The stall has many staffs  and they serve pretty fast,  add this stall in your makan sutra  bucket list in order not to regret.  Plenty of parking space in the basement and lastly wish you all a good day and cheers",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118294397094559885013/reviews

I Am Stanz,4,"#SeriMuslimFood is definitely one of the better Malay food stalls in this area. A long queue is expected but thankfully waiting time is not very long as they have many people taking and preparing your order.
.
My favourite items from their menu are #MeeRebus and #Lontong. Standard menu items ranges from SGD$2.50 to SGD$3.00.

Wilson Chang,3,"Update on Thursday, 23 May 2024
Came here at 11am to avoid the usual long lunch queue, but was disappointed with the food.

Ordered 2 plates of lontong ($3.50ea) + 1 plate of Gado Gado ($3.50). Portions seemed to ""shrink to 2/3"" compared to previous visits.. is this the current trend due to price increase of ingredients ?

Even their popular Nasi Lemak only comes with 1 small chicken wing + 1 egg + 1 pc of cucumber + rice for $3.50.

It's getting pretty expensive to dine in Singapore nowadays.. even hawker food is too expensive!",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102589058598808274925/reviews
