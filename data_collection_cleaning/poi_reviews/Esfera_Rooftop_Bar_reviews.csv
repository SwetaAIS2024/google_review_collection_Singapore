Shanti Devi,5,"A newly open rooftop Spanish Restaurant and Mixology bar.
They serve good spanish food. All the food I tried was awesome. Recommended food to try are Wild mushroom soup, the taste is too good. Some other food to try are Paella Negra, Panado de Pollo, Grilled Mushroom and their dessert are Crema Calalana and Tiramisu.
It is a relaxed enviroment place and feel the good with live band too.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115309707025434586104/reviews

Kimberley Howarth,4,"Really nice rooftop bar with a comfortable cosy feel. Food is good, and I enjoyed the tapas very much. Some of them the portions were very tiny tho... for example the chorizo. Not consistent. The staff and waitresses were all very pleasant, attentive and polite. It's a lovely place to hang out for the evening. However I felt the live band was quite loud (and not very good, unfortunately) and it was challenging to have a conversation. I definitely appreciated the lengths of golden silence in between.... and the washrooms are one floor below haha so you need to take a lift down, or take the stairs.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957590885643931784/reviews
Yap Peilei,5,I love the atmosphere here. The food was lovely and delicious. Especially the Panna Cotta ( forgot to take a picture of it ). It's the best dessert that you should try it.  Prompt service from the staffs.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107425261211297194172/reviews
Jennifer Neng yoke yen,3,"Atmosphere was good.  Impressed.
Service less attentive.  Forgot our order of cold water.  Other times 2 of us waved but none saw us after a while
Food was good but sadly, we spotted cockroach crawling on my plate of squid ink rice and shockingly one on our plate of tiramisu cake!!
Waitress took the plate away, the owner saw and just got rid of the roach without apologies approach.
Worst of all, we were billed in full.  We had to request for a refund of tiramisu.  Duh....

Restaurant wanted to make up BUT with invalid email?",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115047407123723602388/reviews
