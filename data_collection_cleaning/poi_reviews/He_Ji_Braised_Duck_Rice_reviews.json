The biggest issue was the sweet dark sauce used; it was too sweet and not suitable for the health-conscious. It detracted from the taste of an otherwise good porridge, which I remember used to be better.",

The portion seemed reasonable for the price.\n\nThe braised duck was tender, and the broth had a slight herbal taste.  Kway teow was smooth.  Overall, a very pleasant dish.\n\nWill come back for more if I am in the vicinity.",
