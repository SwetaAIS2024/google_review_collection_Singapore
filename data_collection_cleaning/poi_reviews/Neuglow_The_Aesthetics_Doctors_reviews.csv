June Kwan,5,"Dr. Liew is an incredibly patient and caring doctor. I've been under his care for many years, and thanks to him, my pigments has lightened significantly. Cheers to your excellent work! ðŸ©· Also, a big thank you to the front desk staff for always making us feel reassured after each treatment. Today, I had the pleasure of meeting Mei Ting, who is extremely experienced and caring. She made sure the itch on my face completely subsided and provided thorough cleaning. Thank you all! ðŸ˜Š""",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113542720076179038368/reviews
