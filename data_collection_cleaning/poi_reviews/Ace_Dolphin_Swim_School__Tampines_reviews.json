      "text": "I enrolled my children into Ace Dolphin swim school about a month ago after withdrawing from their previous school. They went for a trial class under Coach Gary, and they enjoyed the class so much that they told me to enrol them straightaway.\nThe admin was really nice and patient when I enquired about Ace Dolphin swim school. The process of signing up for trial class and enrolling my children into Ace Dolphin was seamless.\nMy children always have a great time during their class with Coach Gary. My kids said that Coach Gary is a fun and nice coach. Coach Gary is also good at building rapport with children that my kids were sold on attending Coach Gary’s class after their trial lesson. They are always looking forward to their swimming lessons. I’m glad that my kids are enjoying their class. Thank you Coach Gary!",

      "text": "My 7 year old daughter joined Ace Dolphin early 2024 after being with Happy Fish for 4 years. Within the same year, Coach Gary recommended her to go for swimming test Bronze level, something we waited very long for previously. My daughter can be reserved and quiet but Coach Gary managed to make her feel safe with his kind personality and calm demeanour. He is good with children and caring towards them. This shows when he teaches them. My daughter enjoys going to swimming class. Thank you Coach Gary!",

Initially my kids are scared of swimming if they cannot reach the floor, now they are independent and love swimming. My kids refuse to be taught by other coaches now but I am glad we found coach Gary and will stay with Ace Dolphins with coach Gary.",
