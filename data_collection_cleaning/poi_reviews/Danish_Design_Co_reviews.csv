Andy Wyman,5,"We have the Skovby #33 extending dining table in oiled oak. In regular form it easily copes with our family of four and then extends to seat six with ease (and has coped with more).
We like the tapered pedestal and the vertical “coach lines” . We think it combines well with the light oak to give a contemporary, elegant appearance.
The “extending function” makes it a fantastically versatile and “space efficient”piece of furniture. Guests are always impressed when you show them the simple  but impressive mechanism.
We have the Skovby #52 dining chairs in matching oak. Well proportioned, simple frame and comfortable to use.
We are very pleased with the appearance and function of this combination.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115147875422922789230/reviews

Sreevardhan Agarwal,1,"We have ordered from 10 furniture stores in Singapore and this has been the worst experience. They promised us a delivery at the end of February / early March (promised by the showroom). It is now end-March - there is no date provided about when the furniture will be delivered. When we call the showroom, they say that they have no knowledge and it is the back-office which is concerned. There is no accountability. It is the worst customer service I have experienced in my life.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109233392400659799373/reviews
Shreya Jhawar,1,"My experience with Danish Design has been highly disappointing. When placing my order, I was given a specific delivery date (by Zac the salesperson), which was a key factor in my decision to proceed. However, after confirming the order, they completely backtracked on that timeline and asked me to keep referring to the standard timeline in my invoice which said upto 22 weeks / April. Even though while placing the order they repeatedly promised to deliver it by Feb or early March which is my move in date. Despite multiple follow-ups, there was little effort to expedite the process, and I was repeatedly told that nothing was in their control.

I understand delays can happen, but clear communication and accountability go a long way. Unfortunately, I didn’t experience that here. If delivery timelines are important to you, Danish Design is not a place for you at all.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112543001426172042161/reviews
Su Shan Leong,5,"I placed a string furniture order with Danish Design Co., in November 2021. My order arrive in January 2022 but the installation was only completed at the end of February. The delay was due to the Chinese New Year holiday and SG-MY safe travel restriction cause by the pandemic. Despite the installation delay, the delivery and installation man was professional. He was alone and managed to set up the entire set in a couple of hours. I was really pleased with his workmanship. The quality of the String Furniture is top-notch too. Thank you!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103839339221513138035/reviews
