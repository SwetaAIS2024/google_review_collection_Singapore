We rented the house for 4 years. One month after we moving out, I received a bill from landlord for repair work cost $4055 (including vanish living room and dining room area, repair parquet floor & skirting costs $1720!)\nThe landlord hold our deposit and did not tell what are the repair work to be done during 1st inspection and 2nd inspection.\nIf you are renting a unit from this condo, be careful of this landlord!",
