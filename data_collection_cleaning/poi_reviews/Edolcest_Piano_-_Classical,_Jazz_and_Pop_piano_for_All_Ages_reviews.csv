Adrian A,5,"Esther is a fantastic piano teacher who has taught all three of our children over the years, who have all progressed within AMEB with solid grades. She is patient and gives a lot of valuable input during the lesson as well as notes to aid their practice in-between lessons. She always keeps the children interested in piano with a good mix of songs and theory. We have recently recommenced lessons with Esther online as we are now living in different countries and her technique is flawless even though she is teaching online. I would not hesitate to recommend Esther as your piano teacher.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101162877384767604835/reviews
Leisa Bourke,5,Esther is a very professional piano teacher.  She was always consistent in her approach and my son's piano skills developed greatly during his time taught by Esther.  The only reason my son is not a current client of Esther's is that she moved to Singapore.  We miss her lessons!,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109081756318586888051/reviews

Xing Lam,5,"Esther is the first piano teacher we had for my two children when they started their piano journey at age 4 and 7. She is very reliable and responsible, friendly but firm with my kids and my children adored her. She is particularly good at preparing the kids for exams and both my children got their Honor certificates with their respective levels of AMEB.
If not for her relocation back to Singapore from Australia, we would have still happpily been with her for her promising teaching.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113913624056545050001/reviews
