      "text": "Service was really fast because it was an early Monday dinner. Only waited around 10 mins for the food.\n\nThe beef bibimbap was really nice! The sauce was special, there was a bit of roasted sesame taste and some tangy ketchup on top of the usual gochujang.\n\nThe marinated pork was a nice change from the usual gochujang pork, the marinated meat was not overwhelming. The pork was tender and the portion was quite generous! It came with lettuce and special sauce which you can add to the pork. The owner was quite attentive and topped up our kimchi before we even finished the already served kimchi.\n\nHighly recommended!",

Very fast service, & food was so fresh, piping hot. Chilled kimchi was yummy I finished it all. Outdoor sitting but the wind is cooling. Nice music too üëåüèº",
