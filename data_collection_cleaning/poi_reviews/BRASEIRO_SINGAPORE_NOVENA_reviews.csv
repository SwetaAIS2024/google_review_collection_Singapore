Miao Ning Yeo,5,Great food and service at affordable prices. Love the free flow fries. The steaks are on the rarer end but we still enjoyed the medium rare ones pretty much. Fresh lettuce too üëçüèª,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113216638333776212133/reviews
Porter KHOR,3,"Decent value for money.  400g ribeye steak grass fed Aussie beef for 44.90 free flow fries and salad.  Steak was a little dry chewy gristle.  Prob cheap beef from NZ.
Server lady was friendly helpful and attentive.

2nd visit.  Too chewy.  Too much gristle vein see photo.  Beef lacked flavour not juicy.  Probably sous vide and seared.  Wasted jaw effort chewing. 1/5.  Staff was great, replaced with better piece.  No issues.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115681434361834317527/reviews
Giovanni / INVINITIUM Ray,5,Really nice steakhouse with good table/chairs setup. Went there for lunch so it is not crowded. Went for the lunch combo and I was surprised by how good the Camembert Cheese was. The steak is also good and cooked as per request. Maybe only the tiramisu did not have that muh impact. Service was super nice. Thank you for the hospitality.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105064608359697712889/reviews

Shawn Tye,4,Added $8 for the 300g steak. The steak was not done as well as I expected but it was quite juicy and tender. Fresh batch of fries was crispy and full of potato taste.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110704060628952228583/reviews
