Leon Kwang,3,"OK now, the queue on a Saturday morning was perpetual.. 8-10 at any one time.. I was the 6th or 7th when I joined and the wait was 20-ish minutes.. not sure if it were big orders or an efficiency issue (they also accept cash only).

My original idea was a 'bee hoon soup' but almost everyone before me ordered the dry version and I'm glad I took the hint.

The ""mee pok dry"" was pretty good, the noodles weren't great but the chilli more than made up difference. The soup version was a tad bland in my opinion and I won't repeat that the next time I'm here.

Definitely coming back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews
Tan Leslie,5,"Chilli is special, not spicy but unique.
Portion is generous for even a $4 version with big black mushroom in the soup. Queue is long. First time trying. They have the dried beetaibak. Will come again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101061250732659023771/reviews
