The initial 3 boxes i got yesterday were of inferior quality and today after a quick call, they decided to send 3 new boxes to me. I won't say it's the best dream lover i tried, and their durian are on the smaller side, it's still very good. All 6 boxes were ranging 440gm to 495gm. Thumbs up.",

I usually request for a range of durians from bitter to sweet, and they never fail to deliver in terms of quality. They offer home delivery or you could go down to their shop if youâ€™ll like (but do note that the seats are super limited and it is outdoor seating). 5 STARS!!",
