lala,5,"It is a small clinic, as they are sharing it with another specialist. Donâ€™t be fooled by it, as they have excellent podiatrist, Jessie (she looks so stern & fierce, but so meticulous and patient haha), & doctors. We received the best care, under the care of Dr Stephen Kum & Dr Tan Yih Kai. The clinic manager, Jean was also gentle & motherly. It was stressful journey having to take care of ulcer wound, and the blood tests. And the physical journeys to & fro every 2-3 days for wound dressing were tedious, but this clinic team definitely makes the journey less stressful. Full recovery of ulcer wound under their care & TLC.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104877686622607777101/reviews
