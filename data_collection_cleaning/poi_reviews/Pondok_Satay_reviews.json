I always order their satay because they are delicious. Hope people can rate their food rather than not accommodating their request to have smaller orders. 5 stars for me any days!",

We later learnt that our order was raised to 4pcs without our knowledge.\nIt could be an honest mistake but I would suggest to be careful when buying from this stall. Check your order and the amount paid.",
