The very authentic and noodle is springy. the sauce for cold beef is superb.. though the black fungus seems a bit under average n quantity also lesser now. Overall still love this brand. will try other outlet next time",

There are 8 kinds of noodles to choose from and I would recommend \"Small Flat\" as it's very chewy and fresh. For the set, we need to top up $5 to enjoy an additional side dish, a braised egg and a can of soft drink. Quite a good deal!",
