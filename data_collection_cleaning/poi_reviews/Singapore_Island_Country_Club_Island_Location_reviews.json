The review is for the restaurant.\n\nFood: 5/5 - if I could rate the food here, it would be 5++. They had a special menu for Chinese New Yearâ€™s. Everything was delicious and well presented. My favorite was the roasted pig and fresh steamed fish.\n\nService: 4/5 - good service as they were attentive and replaced our dishes with clean ones.\n\nAtmosphere: 5/5 - beautiful interior. We window views of the golf course.\n\nNote: this place is exclusive to members only.",

Food was delicious and a mix of western and local favorites. It felt as if you were no longer in Singapore. I didn't see any buildings at all from the rear balcony of the restaurant. Amazing.",

      "text": "It's definitely a nice place, with a lot of greens and large spaces for a private gathering. Even the grand ballroom, along with the hosting area, was nice.\n\nThat said, it's a little hard to get to for someone without a car, and the parking is frankly speaking a little exorbitant. We had a wedding lunch held here and the carpark alone would have added up to be about 25sgd for a 3hours parking time. For a place that has this much space, as much as I recognize that they're trying to be a little more exclusive, is a little tough to reason.",
