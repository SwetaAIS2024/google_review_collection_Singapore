And thankfully, the ordering time was considered reasonable.\nThe waiting time to collect the drinks, was a bit long. With 3 staffs, I could only say, that was the best, the speed could be.\nFor this outlet, I could not select the coconut meat options for the drink.\nMade me feel like it was a lottery, to see if I am lucky to get the coconut meat in my drink.\n\nMade me wonder why the ordering system wasn‚Äôt consistent.\nThankfully- there was coconut meat.",

      "text": "*Wonder no more, cause I just tried their hot coconut drink...\n\nMine was the Da Hong Bao without milk. It's not hot actually, just warm enough to drink without needing to sip!\n\n(Kudos to their team for being thoughtful in covering the paper cup with a piece of waxed paper, before capping it -- this makes it spill-proof while taking the drink home :)\n\nThis is a rather weird drink if I might say -- I believe \"confused\" would be the right word üòÜ\n\nThe supposedly quality tea leaves** failed to shine through; plus the only coconut feel about this drink is that coconut candy-like aftertaste!?!?\n\nIn this case, there is no synergy at all: 1+1=1.5 only. Their hot drink series appears more like following the \"truffle hype\" but in coconut domain ü§îü§¶\n\nAt $6.10 a cup, this is way too expensive! I'll definitely steer clear and only consider their lite shakes if ever I crave coconuts...\n\nFor this unimpressive coconut based \"hot\" drink, I had to reluctantly take away one ‚≠ê\n\n**I'm better off spending less at Chi Cha 3K for a really hot cup of respectable quality brewed tea like Dong Ding and similar.\n\n-------\n\nToday I tried the peach gum coconut juice drink.\n\nWas expecting firm and chewy gum pieces inside (to mimic boba texture), but it turned out to be overly soft tiny bits kinda like overcooked bird's nest! Lol\n\nThe drink is refreshingly not too sweet, though lacking strong coconut juice flavour*.\n\nStill, imho this is a much better option than most bubble teas... And coconut juice is supposed to reduce \"heatiness\" üòÜ (I happen to be eating deep fried squid (ika karaage) bought from Donki; with instant steamed rice for a quick lunch!)\n\nPlacing an order with their app is such a breeze, so much easier than using the onsite ordering booths :)\n\n*I am wondering if their new hot coconut drinks bring out the taste better ü§î\n\n#MHTamChiak\n#BBTFixed",
