Ribeye,4,"A solid spot for affordable mala xiangguo cravings, Ri Ri Hong is a chain eatery that delivers flavorful hits like the mapo tofu $7 (generous pork mince, silky sauce) and fried long beans $6 (crispy, loaded with numbing hua jiao peppers). The Qing jiao kao yu $22 (green chili fish), however, missed the mark—deep-fried instead of grilled, it leaned greasy, and the hua jiao spice was muted, replaced by a milder localized green chili kick.

Portions are decent for the price, but unfortunately the white rice was stale and hard when we dined there. Overall, a satisfying meal for spice lovers seeking value, though the kao yu grilled fish and rice need tweaking. Stick to the classics here for a fuss-free mala fix!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108129213100021627372/reviews
