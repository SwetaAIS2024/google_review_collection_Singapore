Priscilla M,5,"I opted for the 90-minute foot massage with head, shoulder, and back massage, and it was pure bliss! The place is a bit pricier than other JB massage spots I‚Äôve been to, but for the level of care and quality, it‚Äôs still reasonable (though locals might find it a bit steep).

My masseur, 23, was amazing‚Äîso skilled and thoughtful! He was completely in tune with what I needed, applying just the right amount of pressure. He even served me tea during the session and a dessert afterward. The ambiance was peaceful and quiet, making the whole experience even more relaxing.

The only small hiccup was the front desk staff, who came off a bit rude when asked for more details about the TCM massage üòï",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110984877378826675134/reviews

CHOON YEW WONG,5,"nicely decorated. Situated in the brand new & pleasant quiet neighbourhood of Sunway, surrounded by Korean restaurants. Staff are friendly. Price is quite high by Malaysian standard, but ok for Singaporeans.

Got therapists from China, Vietnam & Burma.

Therapist no. 17 is skilful and does a  good job.  No.18 is weaker.

It's about 10 to 15 minutes' drive from 2nd Link Johor checkpoint.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106136199769841669299/reviews
