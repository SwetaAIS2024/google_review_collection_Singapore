Oli,5,"Nice mala place, no min weight and cheaper than other mala I had, perfect for small eaters. Complimentary fruits given:) staff were quite friendly as well. For non spicy soup, they offer tomato soup that tasted like the sauce from canned baked beans.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109317676203941042086/reviews
Yanyang Xu,5,"Cheap and delicious food here. Mala Xiangguo is reasonably priced with only two prices for Meat and veggies. I usually order around 7 dollars and it’s enough for one person. I also tried grilled fish here, highly recommend. Skewers here are also cheap and delicious.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103992958548226766314/reviews
Kevin Ang,4,Looks like a popular stall selling Mala Xiang Guo as well as other cooked food and skewers. Food is reasonably priced and tastes good.   Will take some time to try the full range of dishes on the menu. Complimentary fruit after the meal!,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247294128726535324/reviews
Asdzxc,1,Ordered via foodpanda. The so called “pancake”餅 $7 for 2 pieces and both came burnt. Whole pancake is full of burnt taste and smell. Yangzhou friend rice is also bland. Pretty the worst Chinese restaurant I’ve ever tried.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101539215907562774269/reviews
Mario Khoe,1,"Ordered yet the shop just constantly skip your order to prepare for delivery takeouts and no apologies at all even when your food is missed.

Not recommended at all. Food did not come.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102289496744682397112/reviews
