Meng Fai Yip,5,"Visited the National Orchid Garden today as it is free admission for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents during the Chinese New Year holidays. The garden was larger than we expected, and we were wowed by the huge variety of orchids there, some of which we had never seen before. If you have friends from overseas who would like to visit the Singapore Botanic Gardens but have limited time there, this would be the place to bring them to.

Here are some photos taken at Sembcorp Cool House.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238839349859158213/reviews
Voidfocal,5,"This hidden gem is probably one of the best indoor locations for pre-wedding shoots and outdoor shoots during a wedding day. In Singapore there are few places that you can go to that allow you to shoot a full pre-wedding or wedding day session without paying a substantial fee, but here for $5 you get access to the National Orchid Garden which has the iconic floral arches and of course the coolhouse itself, which boasts beautiful natural and architectural backdrops for photos. It's about 2 storeys tall inside, with a walkway that snakes from the upper to lower level. The lighting here is beautiful and the architecture combined with the wide range of flora here create such interesting compositional opportunities for photographers of every style. Definitely recommended for your next pre-wedding or casual photoshoot!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104877596206641040127/reviews
M. VÃ©aigh,5,"A hidden gem of Singapore. This isn't high on the list of places to go in Singapore for most people, but it is really cool. It has a ton of orchids and carnivorous plants and you will probably have the whole place to yourself. A welcome place to cool off after a hot day walking in the botanic gardens.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116292957417901170060/reviews
Angelina Bovet,5,"The Sembcorp Cool House is a temperature-controlled glasshouse. With its cool air, drifting mist and waterfall, it houses an extensive collection of rare orchids, more than 1,000 orchid species and hybrids.

Saifu Angto,5,"Awesome section of the National Orchid Garden of Botanic Garden.  It houses a collection of large variety of orchids in the environment of high altitudes forest (1000 to 2000m).  Beautiful arranged flowers, ponds, running waters and air-conditioned room.

The orchids are stunning and unusual.  The walkways winds through plant displays and running water/pond.

It's tucked away in the back corner, but you should not missed it - especially on a hot day as the air-con is nice!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
