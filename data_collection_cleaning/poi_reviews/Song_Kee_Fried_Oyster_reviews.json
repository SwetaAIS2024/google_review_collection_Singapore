But now‚Ä¶ to save time‚Ä¶ the chef essentially dumps the egg with the starch into the egg mixture making there little to no starchy parts.\n\nAlso, the cook uses his hands to scoop the oysters and the sauces which is kinda I believe or should be a health violation‚Ä¶",

So the texture is a mix of egg crisp and starch. üëçüèº their oysters are also fat and juicy, definitely slightly larger than most hawker stalls standard.\n\nBe prepared to queue for it during peak hours, even weekday evenings.",

They cook it slightly wet, with a bit of gravy.\n.\nThe lime infused chili has a good zesty tangy sour spicy kick, lingering on the palate.",
