There are swings available as well.\n\nPlenty of benches are available for you to sit, rest, chill and enjoy nature.\n\nOne round on the footpath track is 290m long.\n\nThere are bicycle stations for you to park your bicycle as well.\n\nThere are a few restaurants and a coffee shop just beside the park so you could grab a quick meal there.\n\nThis place may be a little crowded during evenings.",
