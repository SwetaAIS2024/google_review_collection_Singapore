Gary Ng,5,Hidden gem mall of Singapore. Enjoyed the premium cinema at Eagle Wings. They have good hotpot also. Serene and nice spot to just chill and away just the bustling city of Singapore.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110429727831484436497/reviews

Florence Leow,3,"üüßCame here twice to the new King Albert Park Mall aka KAP mall ( once in the night & once in the afternoon).

üîµ I used to study at Ngee Ann Polytechnic nearby, and the former KAP mall was a bigger one ( ‚úîÔ∏è the older KAP mall used to house the Mcdonalds HQ in Singapore and it had a huge Cold Storage Supermkt too).

üü® Fast forward, the older KAP mall was demolished, and in its place, stood a condominium apartment complex which has 2 floors of mall shops. ‚û°Ô∏èüü• The new KAP mall reopened in 2021.

üîµ The mall size has now been reduced drastically. It felt very crammed and small. There is also a small cinema in the mall building on ground level.

‚ùáÔ∏è Overall, it is a smallish mall which I think caters more to the people living around there in the premium neighbourhood.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews

Mambo G,3,"KAP = Eagle Eye Centre.
