HH Tan,4,"Delicious vegetarian kway chap located centre of the food centre.. price is still economic at only $4
Food portion is quite generous too.! Mild spicy and south chiili sauce enhances the taste.
Will try other dish when visit again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111191568841607507767/reviews
Aries Liew,4,"A great community market. There is almost everything here, and the restaurants are also very rich covering the needs of all ethnic groups. I like the atmosphere of human fireworks here, the atmosphere is very peaceful and harmonious. I think the concepts and directions of the Singapore government and local management are very far-sighted, and their infrastructure is designed to meet all current and future development needs as much as possible!

The reopening after renovation also gives people a brand new feeling! Coupled with the Chinese New Year decorations, it makes people feel a strong sense of the New Year.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102318685297858600682/reviews

Rajaram Sahu,5,"The Ba Chor Mee at The Marketplace@58 is a standout dish. Despite being oily, the soup has a surprisingly light feel. It may sound contradictory, but once you try it, you'll see that it works. Another highlight of the dish are the dumplings, which are different from the typical ones found at most wanton mee stalls and are certainly worth trying.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112480799813759895405/reviews
