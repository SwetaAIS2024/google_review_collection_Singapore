When patient missed the number and came up to the desk to ask she said ‚Äúyou should‚Äôve sat at where the screen is‚Äù\n\nThen why did you guys put seats at the side where the tv screen is not facing? So everyone sitting at that side will miss their queue number cos there‚Äôs no tv screen there.\n\nI don‚Äôt understand why the most useless and non empathetic people always choose to work frontline in private healthcare. My god, if you hate people or can‚Äôt be bothered to assist SICK people go and find another job or just sit at home.",

I appreciate her gesture along with her partner who registered my daughter (I didnt catch her name). Its nice to have this two staffs who can actually go beyond their customer service to attend to us eventho‚Äô the clinic was full. Mentioned waiting time was more than 1 hour however they managed to prioritise my daughter eventho i had to wait for quite sometime. Doctor Loh is also nice too, very patient and detailed. I am thankful for these kind soul with the kind gestures and I appreciate it so much.",
