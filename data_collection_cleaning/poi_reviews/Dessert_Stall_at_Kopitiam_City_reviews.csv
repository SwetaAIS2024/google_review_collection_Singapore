ÈòøÂÆù,2,"The lady staff managed the stall during the night we visited the food court seemed to have had a bad day or maybe she was too tired after a long day‚Ä¶

Her tone was unfriendly & despite us repeated our order twice, she made an Ice Kajang instead of a Red Bean Ice (which on the signboard they are two different desserts)‚Ä¶ when we highlighted that to her, no apology no words but just an irritated facial expression then she went back to make the right dessert‚Ä¶
