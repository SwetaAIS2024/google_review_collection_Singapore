Hartono Harjono,5,"This place is a one-stop hub with a remarkable range of services - from a fruit stall and coffee shop to a bakery, salon, Watson, grocery shop, dessert shop, workshop, education center, market, and even a lottery store. It's like you can live your life here with all your needs met.

While it may not offer 5-star hotel service, it excels in providing straightforward and efficient service. Overall, I highly recommend this market for its convenience and diversity. It's truly a one-of-a-kind place!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102944719141464210600/reviews
