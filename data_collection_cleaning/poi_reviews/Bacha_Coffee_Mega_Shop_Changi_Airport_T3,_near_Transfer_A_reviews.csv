Casey W,1,Third time coming here this year. We didn't buy on the start of the holiday as we thought we would get it on the way home..wish we had brought it a few weeks ago. The service today was disgusting like the people didn't want to serve us. We had to wait and basically neg to get attention.  Then we dealt with attitude from the staff. You might be gourmet but at these prices your staff should be a lot friendlier.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114512927266614092828/reviews
Fab Foodie Swede Malin Nordblom,4,"Either you want to have a coffee on the go, a croissant or but some coffee. Great choices if you wanna bring your favourite coffee back home. If you order a coffee to drink at the airport, don’t forget that you can’t bring onboard the airplane.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107062657007062713328/reviews
Shubham Gupta,5,"Highly recommend the many flavored croissants. Loved the coffee chocolate, mushroom and almost all favours. The packaging is very cute and perfect to carry some sweet treats for friends and family. The coffee is also great. A bit on expensive side.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111002990360132223790/reviews
