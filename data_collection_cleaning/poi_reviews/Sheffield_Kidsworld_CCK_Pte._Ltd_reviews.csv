Ranetha,5,"Within a few months of joining Sheffield, I see so much of improvement in my daughter's reading and speaking. Even my relatives have noticed that my daughter speaks so well now! Would like to express my sincerest gratitude to Sheffield family for nurturing Rochelle. What's more amazing are the unique educational hands-on activities which Rochelle's previous preschool did not do. Rochelle looks forward to come to school everyday and it makes me feel so happy and safe to send my daughter here. Thank you",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116972102981370689286/reviews
shelby collins,5,"Dear Sheffield Team, we would like to thank all of you for your wonderful patience and guidance for imparting knowledge and life skills to our Son.

He joined Sheffield Kidsworld in 2022 as a shy and playful boy but has since matured and grew up to be a very inquisitive and knowledgeable primary 1 student. From the bottom of our hearts, we sincerely appreciate all the time spent into teaching our son and shaping him to a smart and confident primary 1 student.

Putting him at Sheffield kidsworld was the best thing that has happened to him. As it is at Sheffield where he gained his confidence and motivation to learn. He has been selected as class monitor now.

Hopefully his primary school will nurture him as well as Sheffield did a great job",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115047038086838737108/reviews
