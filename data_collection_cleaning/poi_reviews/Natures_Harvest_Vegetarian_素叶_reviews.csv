Jaz,5,"I was not only pleasantly surprised by the taste of the product, but also the quality and the personal touch of the owners of Nature‚Äôs Harvest Á¥†Âè∂. They are prompt in replying my text messages when I have forgotten where I bought the vegan buns. It's amazing how their earthly approach swiftly converted me to explore their Sengkang stalls instead of my initial rigidness to only travel to central locations. This is one typical success story of how humility and sincerity in managing a business reap good harvest naturally. Coincidentally, its brand name speaks for itself! Well done!!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108851692139041277603/reviews
