The YellowBrick,1,"Do not order from this store. I ordered beef rendang from this store and they gave me a box with zero beef rendang. Just ONE single piece of fried tofu in the rendang sauce. This store is a joke. I paid $9.90 hoping for a good meal, but I ended the day with a big disappointment. Will definitely not be buying from this stall again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108437881490296597816/reviews
Chloe Hang,1,"Opening hours clearly stated 7 am. I came at 7:15 am but was told rice only ready at 8am? So no nasi lemak available yet state open at 7am. What’s the point Crave Nasi Lemak??? People come here for nasi lemak mainly isn’t it, this causes confusion if only chicken wing is available at 7am",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114588026845584866705/reviews
Florence M,1,"Bought my Nasi Lemak set with a stick of fish Otah at $1 from Clementi Mall outlet on 13/9/23.   Open up found that the otah was full of mould.     I throw it away straight.   Very bad,  Grave management must look into this please.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104033963137480569980/reviews
