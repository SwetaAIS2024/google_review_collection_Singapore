Ashley Liew,5,"Orchard Central is an excellent mall conveniently located within Orchard Road, close to Somerset MRT station ok the red line. Parking is available here but note there are many levels you have to drive up and down to. The food is the best part here with so many F&B options on many different levels with a nice view too. Quite nice retail therapy offered too!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
