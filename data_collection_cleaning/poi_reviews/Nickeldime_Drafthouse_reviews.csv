Kevin Ang,4,"A beer bar offering a very wide range of beers on tap, spanning the globe. While range is excellent, price is a bit on the high side. Server was extremely friendly and gave free tasting portions before customer decides on the final selection to enjoy. Takeaway receives 10% discount.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247294128726535324/reviews
Benny T.,2,"I find the fish and chips quality unfortunately, did not meet my expectations for the price I paid. The fish portion was small and tasted mostly like just cooking oil. The fries were soggy and lacked flavor, while the pasta was decent but not outstanding. To add to the disappointment, the craft beer prices were also high. In total, we spent $80 on the meal, and to make matters worse, we were the only customers on a Saturday night, which was surprising. Overall, the experience was underwhelming considering the cost and lack of ambiance.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111773065448350205829/reviews
Tan Long Hwee,4,Craft beers galore!! Great variety of choices to suit your taste buds! The prices are a bit on the higher side (I would give them another star if prices are 20% lower). Did not get the chance to try their pizza though.. the garlic fries is heavenly!! And they go well with craft beer!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102637795955714189204/reviews
Bendy Chua,4,"Went on a weekend dinner, not many people. The mushroom pizza was not too bad, it would be enough for two pax.

The pork ribs were good. Like the salad side as well which helps to balance the jelatness.

They have a range of alcohol to choose from on the chalkboard (not on their menu).",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105997919912211881722/reviews
lance kwok en Cheng,4,"This place is very cosy, and offers a pretty wide selection of beers on tap. Food wise, they will not disappoint you with their finger and bar food. It's delicious. Just that it may be a tad too salty for some individuals. This place also has screens that shows soccer matches, and friendly staffs that'll assist you on the type of beers that you may be more accustomed to. Easy to have a conversation with your friends as the music here isn't too loud.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117361932774134204234/reviews
