Mohamed Haniffa,5,"Don't mistake it to be a grocery store as the name kinda suggestsðŸ˜‡Its actually a indian food stall,located inside Padi Emas.Food such as mee/mee hoon/nasi goreng are good.Havent tried their thosai thou. Rojak is ok. Murtabak good.Friendly staffs.
A recent hike in prata pricing,kinda discourages me from buying prata there.
$2.20 for 2plain pratas,My Goodness.ðŸ˜µ
But tastewise,it's decent.Stall is kept clean as well. Diner take note: plates have to returned to the Plates/tray station.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106001901776455159598/reviews
Canapehouse Canapehouse,5,"Decent Indian royal, chicken curry briyani is nice as well. Their shrimp wadai is good but at times prawns can be overcooked or not fresh but overall. One of my fave stall for bee hoon goreng ikan bilis too. The pratas are only good in the morning as they are made to order.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103369654073478406528/reviews
