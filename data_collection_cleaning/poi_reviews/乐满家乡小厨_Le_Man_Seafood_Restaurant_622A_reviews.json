The best is there lobster platter, lobster are fresh with fruits salad, besides that, they put in a lot of effort for creating the sides like fried scallops, chicken wrap sea cucumber with asparagus, jelly fish and egg salad, definitely a must try and recommended presentable dish! Will definitely patron here again!",

We ordered the fried sin chew bee hoon ( basic dish) and the salted egg yolk pork ribs.\nThe bee hoon has some wok hei and tasted ok but it was too oily and there was not much ingredients.\nThe pork chop was tender and the salted egg yolk added amazing flavour to this dish. This is one of the better salted egg yolk dish that I have eaten.\nService is fast but the lady taking order only speaks mandarin.",

As a resident in the Area I'm super, super glad that this Zichar opened near my estate!\n\nThe wait can be quite long, so please be prepared or visit during non peak hours.... trust me, it's worth it!\n\nHighly recommend their range of individual rice/noodle dishes. E.g Dry beef horfun, 奶黄排骨饭.. etc. VERY well priced - my go to place especially when everything is so pricey now!",
