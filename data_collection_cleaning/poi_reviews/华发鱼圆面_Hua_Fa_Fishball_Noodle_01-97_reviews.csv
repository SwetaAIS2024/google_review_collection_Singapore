C K Leong (Ah Leong San),4,"This stall is ran by a middle aged couple which surprisingly accepts only cash. Queue is long and even after the order I could go get my drink, sit down and wait for another 15 minutes or so for my order. Guy really take his time to cook the noodles and mixed it well. Which explains the queue as most of them are residents and know that after their orders they just sit nearby for the food. I ordered the large bowl ($4.50) and added ingredients ($1). It came in big bowls of noodles and soup with ingredients. Noodles are done well but just lack the taste I liked for in dry noodles. Ingredients are definitely factory made so to me itâ€™s ok. Hence the 4 stars rating.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108882315597576503809/reviews
Nick Koh,4,"They accept cash only, no QR code payment. They close early and often sold out before noon. The queue moves slowly as each bowl is prepared one by one.

I ordered the large fishball noodle($4.50) with extra ingredients (+$1.00).

The noodles had a good mix of vinegar, broth, bean sprouts and lard which had an overall salty and balance of acid from vinegar and alkaline noodles.

The fishballs, fish cakes and fish dumpling tasted fresh and not too salty.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109956087041534450854/reviews
Zi Liang Ng (Zi Liang),4,"Ordered the 4.50$ fish ball noodle dry. It is an ok fish ball noodle nothing too fancy.  Noodle is not too soft that is a plus.

S L,4,"Popular stall selling old-school tasting fishball noodles with lard, and closes at 12-12.30pm. $3.5 / $4.5 for small and big bowl.

Come before 11.30am before the fishballs sell out. When they do, the stall will put up a sign - watch out for this sign before queuing. Cash only.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111316266362121177513/reviews
James Wang,3,"Mediocre tasting fishball noodles using factory made fishball and fishcake. Noodles lack fragrance and punch even thou there was pork lard. Nonetheless there was a long snaking queue on a Sunday morning, probably due to the fact that they serve a $3.50 portion, enough for a small eater.

Totally regretted queueing close to 30mins for this.

I did see two other fishball noodle stall with long queue using handmade fishballs, so maybe those will be worth checking out.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111573552076106723163/reviews
