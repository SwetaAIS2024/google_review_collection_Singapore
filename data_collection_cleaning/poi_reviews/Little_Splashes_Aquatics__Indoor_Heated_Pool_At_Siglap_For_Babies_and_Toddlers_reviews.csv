Ashley Chung,5,"My 1 year old toddler has been going to Little Splashes Siglap for the past term and she enjoys it very much! Teacher Hazel is very patient and good with little kids, which made my toddler feel very at ease as she builds up her water confidence through fun songs and activities to teach various skills like kicking, water submersion, safe entrance/ exit from pool, blowing bubbles, backfloat, free float‚Ä¶. The staff there are also generally very friendly. The props at the pool are great too, the amenities are complete with good showering and diaper changing areas. Also love how the Siglap area is generally quiet and peaceful so I dun stimulate my toddler unnecessarily.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116095833210790050722/reviews
