Dadima Kimmex,5,"I’ve had a great experience with Boon at Podiatry Quest. He’s incredibly detailed and truly wants the best for his patients.

Boon took me through a thorough assessment, explaining everything clearly, and provided exercises to work on at home. As a runner, I found the Runeasi analysis especially interesting—it’s packed with data, and I learned a lot about my asymmetry and areas of weakness. Highly recommend!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103057079349677587254/reviews
Michelle Aurelia Setiawan,5,"Great clinic for runners! I recently visited the clinic due to persistent calf pain from my marathon training. Podiatrist Boon Kiak was incredibly helpful in pinpointing the root of the problem through a detailed 3D & video running gait analysis, revealing issues with my running form I never noticed.

Boon Kiak’s knowledge of running and footwear is really helpful too. He took the time to explain my condition clearly and provided tailored advice & rehab exercises on how to improve my running and prevent future injuries. I also underwent shockwave therapy for my calf pain, which was a game-changer. My pain disappeared substantially after just one session.

I highly recommend this clinic to any runner experiencing foot or leg pain. Thank you Boon Kiak for your help!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111443919463247684451/reviews
Jolyn P,5,"I’m glad to have found Podiatry Quest.

Saw podiatrist Boon Kiak for nagging ankle pain. He conducted a thorough assessment with professionalism and provided exceptional care and advice. He also did shockwave therapy on my ankle and the pain was immediately alleviated.

The counter staff was also very friendly.

All in all, a great first podiatry experience.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100328610070142950104/reviews
C Low,5,"Boon Kiak's experience and knowledge in this area has been instrumental in identifying the unique cause of my heel pain which escalated and persisted for many months last year. I had been to the chiropractor, physiotherapist, orthopedic specialist with MRI scan but none of them were able to identify the cause and could only treat the symptoms temporarily or offer invasive temporary treatment solution. Boon Kiak was able to tell what was causing the heel pain on the 1st session, and did his best to treat and teach me the exercises I required to help my heel recover. I never thought I could have pain-free days again but he made it possible! Highly recommend! He is always helpful and sincere to address whatever questions you might have.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101561943537621464245/reviews
Jeanon Goh,5,"An excellent clinic for runners and people looking to address foot pains. Boon Kiak is a really friendly, warm and eloquent podiatrist, who thoroughly addressed my concerns. He provided a few different options for my foot pains, and did not push for the most expensive custom insoles. Overall, I had a great experience for my 2 sessions here.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103513290081676823040/reviews
