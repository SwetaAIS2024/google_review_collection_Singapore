K H,1,"I contemplated for a long time on whether to write this but have decided to do so in the event that potential patients refer to such reviews.

I saw Dr Lim for an O&G related matter - non pregnancy. If you‚Äôre going to him for pregnancy or fertility issues he might remain a good option.

But anything other than that and I do not recommend.

Situation 1: additional doctor
1) on my first operation, I was not briefed beforehand that there would be another doctor in the room.
2) was only made aware of this when I was wheeled into the OT
3) this doctor was wearing her mask below her chin in a sterile environment and talking to Dr Lim who already had his mask up. Anyone who works in the medical industry knows this is NOT standard practice
4) I was told that she would be assisting the procedure but not that she would actually touching me - which I believed she did because it felt like 2 different paired of hands on me. Note: this is an assumption and not factual

Situation 2: lack of proper briefing & conflicting information
1) I always had to be the one asking questions on what to expect and how to care for myself moving forward
2) I was told I‚Äôd be given LA, then was not given anything.
3) had a cyst that was too insignificant to remove, and was told not to worry / monitor every few months. But on the follow up before my second operation, i was asked if I wanted to scan again and it was suggested that I could remove it together. I turned down the additional ultrasound scan and said I would like another professional opinion about this. Having asked for more opinions after this, I now know that this was excessive and not necessary. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt move forward with this because it would have extended the operation. In hindsight this might have been either a miscommunication or differing in opinion - but this is how it appeared to me

Situation 3: literally NO FOLLOW UP
1) after my second operation, I was given painkillers despite being told I‚Äôd be given antibiotics
2) there‚Äôs literally NO follow up since then. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs an oversight of the doctor or the team, but this is awful?! How can you drop a patient just like this?
3) given my bad experience thus far I‚Äôve decided not to follow up cause goodness knows I‚Äôll be putting myself through more anxiety

Situation 4: bad communication
1) on multiple occasions, I had to follow up to request for information / documents that I was told would be sent to me.

some examples:
‚Ä¢ operation was schedule on a date that I did not provide beforehand
‚Ä¢ had to prompt to reply to insurance company who had questions, in order for LOG to be issued
‚Ä¢ had to request for test results to be sent to me instead of it being automatically shared

I have read such good reviews of Dr Lim and heard of him through connections and his days in the public sector. It‚Äôs disappointing to see this kind of treatment in a private setting.

2) my insurance covers 100% for the cost, and after consultation at times I was recommended to pay upfront (something about how certain outpatient/ inpatient coverage - cannot speak for the exact way it was phrased).  The first time I paid, the second time I denied this and I believe there hasn‚Äôt been any issue with claims thus far.

My recommendation to patients: if your insurer covers the cost, do not pay upfront if not needed: DYOR and read the details.

That said, the silver lining is that I do believe the operation might have been successful (to update in the future). There was once instance the staff was also very accommodating and kind, which I appreciate.

But my overall experience has been traumatising to say the least, and my stance remains the same.

In case the clinic tried to take my review down, I‚Äôve attached a photo to show proof of communication with the clinic - and can further substantiate appointments if needed.

Update: I‚Äôve been contacted after posting this review but will refrain from following up until I‚Äôve sought more legal and medical advice. The clinic has kindly shared my medical reports and tests with me.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107810340858049600968/reviews
Vidya Sankaran,5,"We are extremely grateful to Dr. Lim and his team for diligent care through our pregnancy and birth of our healthy baby girl.

Dr. Lim is extremely calm and consultative in his approach, clearing all our doubts patiently and discussing the way forward over the several months we were with him. He has a systematic manner of ensuring healthy progression of pregnancy for both the mother and baby.

At 35 weeks, when I was diagnosed with pregnancy induced hypertension, he started immediate treatment through medication and monitoring, and delivered my baby 2 weeks later to optimise baby‚Äôs maturity at birth and my health.

We also found his team very helpful with logistics and medication through this time. Special shout out to Diyana who was very supportive at the clinic, and constantly available on WhatsApp through business hours for any assistance.

A big thank you to Dr. Lim and his team for helping us manage the ups and downs of bringing our little girl to this world üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109420574598857252663/reviews

Charuta Deo,5,"I would like to highly recommend Dr Lim Min Yu for your sweet baby journey!!
He delivered my baby and the whole process was smooth. He was very thorough in the process and took care of all the required tests and other aspects during my pregnancy journey. He made sure that I am very comfortable throughout and answered all our questions in depth, which gave us very clear idea of the process.
