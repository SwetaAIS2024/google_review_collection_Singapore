      "text": "Brought my 4year old daughter here for her first hair cut. The hairstylist named Ngoi did a great job. My daughter did not cry and was enjoying her first hair cut throughout as the stylist's haircut was swift and accurate. Requested for almost 2inch trim for her long hair and fringe was cut according to request. At $14 the cut was well worth it. We left the EC house as satisfied customer. Highly recommended for parents out there who is unsure of where to bring their kids for their first haircut.",
