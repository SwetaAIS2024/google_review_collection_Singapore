Seriously, it's better than other well know western restaurant. The sirloin is juicy and the fried chicken wings are very tasty. For the beef slider, the mean is a little cooked though but understand it is more suitable for children. I will be back!",

      "text": "I had a great meal at Lazy Later and wanted to share my experience. I ordered the sirloin, and it was tender, juicy, and cooked just the way I like it. The meat was flavorful and easy to cut — no toughness at all. But what really stood out were the chips. They were golden, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside — absolutely delicious. Dipping them in the mayonnaise took things to another level. The mayo was creamy and rich, a perfect match for the hot, crispy chips. Simple, satisfying, and definitely worth coming back for.",
