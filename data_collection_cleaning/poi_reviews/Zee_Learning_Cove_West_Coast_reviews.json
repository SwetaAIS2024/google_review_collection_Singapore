Previously he was with the playgroup at Sparkletots and he was not able to communicate nor speak.\n\nDuring his 2 years in Zee Cove,  Nzo has learned to speak abit and able to express himself.\n\nHe enjoys going to the centre and has ever since picked up some verbal skills such as greetings.\n\nHe was also toilet trained by his helpful teachers at the centre.\n\nVictor Might Tango (very much thanks) and appreciation to Zee Cove!",

      "text": "Both of my kids attended this school since they were 2 years old. Although as compared to the other private schools, the compound is smaller, I find lots of advantages unlike others. Firstly, the good class size ratio means teachers spend quality time with my kids. They are so patient, kind and understanding, and it is honestly half the battle won when the kids love their teachers and are more receptive to listen to them.\nSecondly, I genuinely love the school decorations. They were a lot of handicrafts and made the environment very heart warming and cozy.\nThirdly, my kids are vegetarian and it isn’t easy to find a school which accommodates this dietary preference. I appreciate the healthy food cooked by the auntie in school and my kids are eating well too!\nWe also love the cute gatherings held by the school, be it Children’s Day celebration or mid autumn festival. The kids’ grandparents get to join too. For excursions, even my son who has graduated gets to join (if he is having school holiday). It felt a lot like a big family with lots of love and care. As parents, we receive biweekly reports on the school activities, and teachers are easily reached via app. So cute that they would even check in on the kor kor as his sister chatted about him in school. Love the school and teachers!",

      "text": "My Daughter attended Zee learning cove for a short period of time ( 6 months) and we had just arrived from Switzerland, completely different culture, different languages, food etc.\nShe received great care and a lot of warmth and love, and it was a great relief for us to see how well the transition went.\n\nThe teachers were structured, attentive and kind. Various and enriching activités were organised throughout our stay there and\nmy daughter had grown a deep bound with the teachers, we sadly had to leave because we moved too far away.\nI would highly recommend Zee learning cove.",
