Can especially be seen in pool with a few broken tiles.\n\nThat said, I love the tranquility and the opportunity to visit the famous Raffles lighthouse.\n\nThe staff are very super nice especially the staff at the bistro. Views are really nice at sunset as well.\n\nNot much to do but very nice place to chill.\n\nWill return again to lepak.",

However, in the past months, we have noticed that no managers were on duty, especially over the weekends, or public holidays.\n\nWe have noticed that when certain matters that require managerial attention, the general staff have to bear the brunt of pacifying unhappy customers.\n\nThis is extremely concerning as this will be stressing the ground staff out tremendously, when all of which could have been avoided, if the duty manager were around, during peak periods like weekend dinner.\n\nWe sincerely hope, you in senior management, can do something to alleviate the situation, and prevent long term efficient staff from leaving.",

Elsie was very helpful throughout our whole process and helped us whenever we had issues that we were facing. Sheâ€™s very trust worthy and her team was on the ball. We initially had a lawn solemnisation but due to bad weather, her team had to move everything indoors and it was done quick and managed to make it in time.\n\nWe had a blast and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a beautiful sunset as your backdrop.",
