Sze Mei NG,4,"Came for the complementary breakfast buffet and welcome drink at lunchtime.
Breakfast buffet: Good selections of beverages. Limited choices of Western style, Chinese, Indian, and Japanese food. Crispy Hash brown. Fresh fruits (I like papaya). Not bad for simple breakfast.
Welcome drinks: different from the beverages station of breakfast buffet. For takeaways or dine in.
Very busy at the breakfast buffet. So quiet during lunchtime in spite of lunch special promotion.
Service: efficient, prompt. Smiles. Friendly and polite staff. Refill food and clean up very fast. So far, the best service among IBIS hotel's restaurants (compare with Singapore, Japan, and Australia). --- 8/10
Venue: typical decor. Slightly packed. Clean and tidy. Ourdoors dining is available. TV new during breakfast.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110691822088620237996/reviews

Nizze S,5,"Their food is value for money, especially their lunch set. Had the oglio alio spaghetti. The pasta was nicely done al dente, It has a light coating of olive oil with a tinge of spicy heat and succulent prawns üëç  The atmosphere is cosy and the service is great too. The service staff is very attentive and prompt.

If you are looking for a nice place to have a quiet and cosy meal, do drop by their cafe üëç",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101115229480166107014/reviews
Elsa Goh,3,Tried this restaurant under eatigo 50% discount n it's good. Visited again for the SGD10 set lunch this time. The choices for set lunch is a little limited. There were only 3 prawns in my pasta but the taste is not bad tho. Set lunch comes w a drink. The coffee can do better. Tea seems a better choice w top up of hot water. Go for the eatigo deal. You will not regret it.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107304022497740772158/reviews
