Vipula Manu,5,Great experience learning Ukulele in group & private class from Kenyang. As a student coming from a non musically trained background; he was able to adjust teaching style to suit my music learning. Would strongly recommend taking his classes.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104425512606949915985/reviews
Qiaoru Han,5,"Started learning Ukulele at Replugged Music in a group setting. The instructor Kang Yang is very friendly, patient and teach according to individual's pace. I continue to learn Pop Piano from Kang Yang when Ukulele program completed. He managed to keep me interested in learning and always introduce new stuff every week! It has been a year and I'm still looking forward to go for lesson every week. Highly recommended!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105857923398155130273/reviews
Rae Nah,5,"Being an adult learner who doesnâ€™t have a lot of time to practise, I must complement Kang Yang for his amazing level of patience. Under his tutelage, I have learnt 3 instruments.
