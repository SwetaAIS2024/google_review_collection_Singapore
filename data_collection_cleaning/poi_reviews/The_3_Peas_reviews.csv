Javad Namazie,5,"A quiet little hole-in-the-wall in Robertson Quay, The 3 Peas is a delightful spot to spend a few hours with tasty drinks (and very reasonably priced for the area! ) and good conversation. A little gem of an oasis in an area that has become somewhat insufferably crowded.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105121132142383420080/reviews

Kevin Leman,4,"Unassuming little bar in a beautiful neighborhood. The staffs were all friendly, and quick to refill my water. Drink choices are straight forward.

Would give this place a 5 star, but since they do not offer food/light bites (had to purchase on my own at the 7/11 next door) - I had to stick with 4 star. Hopefully in the future they will offer food here.

However I had a very pleasant experience here - and would definitely come back.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101595342985767390494/reviews
Nicola H,5,"I love this place for a drink on the river. Not as racaus as the bigger bars in the area, and the cocktails are prepared and created with a lot of thought and care. Well priced for the area, the quality and the service. The two owners or managers who are often there are absolutely lovely and you can tell they care about the bar.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106713969848793379020/reviews
