      "text": "Check out their Happy Hour as the drinks is kind of bargain.\nGreat selection of drinks to choose from however I strongly recommend their customise Gin where you can choose Fever Tree mixer and wide range of ganish “if you like Gin”\nAs for food please look for Ms FeiFei as there are a lot of hidden food which not be found in their menu.\nWith out total surprised their homemade fishball, oyster omelette (a little expensive ) but it’s one of the best you can find in Singapore, Beef Steak cook to perfection ( easily win those 5 stars beef house ),\nGarlic prawn and sooooo much more.",

The music was just right, the volume perfect and the interiors welcoming .\n\nFei, the manager and Sri who looked after us were very hospitable.\n\nThe 3 to 6 pm gin , sangria pricing are great value for money\n\nthe pizza was outstanding. liked the thin crispy base and sprinkling pieces of tomatoes on the Margherita pizza added to the taste .\n\nA few suggestions: the whisky menu is very basic . Needs to be improved.\n\nThe pricing if one wants to use the cigar room at a minimum 150 dollars per pax is hard to understand. Maybe have a cover charge of 30 dollars for smoking one’s cigars\n\nOverall , We had an enjoyable evening over whiskies , gin and pizzas.",
