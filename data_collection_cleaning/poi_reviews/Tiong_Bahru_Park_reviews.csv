The park features a big playground for children, a therapeutic garden, some gazebos, many sheltered areas with seating, and a dog run. Thereâ€™s also a public restroom with water coolers for drinking.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113002867544321957411/reviews

Alan Teo,5,One of the most beautiful parks in Singapore that I have come across. There's a tilting train with numerous slides coming out on both sides of the train cabins. There's also sand in the park and kids love to play in the sand and built sand castles! Surely one of the most fun parks for kids around. There are also two flying foxes set up and my first time seeing this in a playground! There are also other playground set up for toddlers as well as an exercise park for the elderly. Extremely impressed by this park set up. A 'must' visit for kids!!! And it's free too.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108110685973303951841/reviews
