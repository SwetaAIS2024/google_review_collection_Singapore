Eugene Oo,5,"Friendly trainer! Very accomodating and flexible timings. Jereme is able to book courts at his place or near by which is very convenient.

Lessons are very chill, easy to attend while always being focused on key skills/stroke to make you a better tennis player.

After the few lessons with Jereme, we managed to pick up tennis as beginners and can now play it socially. Thank you!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110803219976501977149/reviews
