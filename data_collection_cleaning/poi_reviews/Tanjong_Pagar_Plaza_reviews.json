Many historic traditional shops are hosted here with rich backgrounds. You can get many things done in this area - grocery, flowers, bakeries, cafes, affordable meals, and retail. Feels like you are in the heartlands but its right smack within CBD. Carpark is a little dim and crammed but still decent. Very accessible via Tanjong Pagar MRT as well. Love the blend of modern and traditional culture!",
