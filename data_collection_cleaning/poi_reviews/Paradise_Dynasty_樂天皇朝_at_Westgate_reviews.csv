viking T,4,"1st time here for dinner. Took the standard menu (no beef & seafood). Soup base (Mala).
Overall, the Mala taste is nice. Not overly oily (able to drink). I like it. Steamboat choice is pretty limited but complimented with the cook food select, making it a sumptuous meal. Good attentive staff. Happy & will return again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117279516290197236406/reviews
Meomeo Conner,5,"The food is nice. Always the best choice when craving for xiao long bao in Jurong East area. They have the special 8 flavor XLB, look so nice but for me the ogirinal flavor is the best. You can see they make XLB in the kitchen when you walkin the restaurant.
Besides good food, services crew here is also super friendly and helpful. The Vietnamese staff at cashier introduced me to joined membership to get discount and earn point. So helpful. Recommended Xiao Long Bao, Pan-fried Shanghai bun, Drunken Chicken, Pork chop fried rice.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106810912187919958500/reviews
Ming Shen Tham,4,"Paradise Dynasty is a popular spot, especially during dinner hours, so it‚Äôs best to make a reservation in advance if you don‚Äôt want to wait.

Food-wise, it‚Äôs generally consistent, though I personally find their noodle dishes to be more reliable than the stir-fry options. My go-to is the dry spicy noodles with pork and prawn dumpling‚Äîit's flavourful without being overly spicy, and always hits the spot.

Their stir-fry dishes can be hit-or-miss. For example, the spinach stir-fry can be well-seasoned on some days but completely bland on others. The stir-fried beef also suffers from this inconsistency.

Appetiser-wise, the black fungus with peppercorn and garlic used to be a favourite, but they seem to have reduced the quality recently, making it tougher to chew. On the other hand, the cucumber with garlic, chilli and vinegar is refreshing and appetising, and the drunken chicken remains flavourful and well-marinated.

Overall, it‚Äôs a good place to pop by, especially if you're craving reliable noodles and decent sides, just manage your expectations with the stir-fry.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116082735539712168059/reviews
Riki Koe,5,"Had a wonderful dinner at Paradise Dynasty Westgate. This was recommended by son. We tried minced meat noodles, wonton noodles üçú & Shanghai fried rice. The minced meat noodles were chewy, very tasty gravy with generous portion of minced meat üòã. It's a huge bowl.
I like the wonton, it's fresh with huge prawn inside. Pork bone broth was milky & tasty.
Lastly, the fried rice was delicious & fragrance, it'a comfort food üòâ",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101883927031130828006/reviews
