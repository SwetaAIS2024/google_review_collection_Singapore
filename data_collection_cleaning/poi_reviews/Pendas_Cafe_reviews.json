We also enjoyed dining by the poolside where you can bask in the night view and cool breeze.\n\nFor breakfast, they offer basic local and Western food choices.",

The variety is awesome, including authentic Malaysian nasi lemak (with beef rendang and curry chicken for sides), porridge with condiments, western-style salad, fruits, toast, prata/roti with dhal, fuit juices, milk and coffee. It complements the hotel stay very nicely.",
