Benito Linus,5,"Love the curry puff from this bakery shop. It's available only in the morning. Price slightly increased during these few years but I'm still buying it daily. The skin was not too thick with a nice crisp texture. Curry potato was tasty and it has some eggs in it too.

Another of my favourite is the salted bun. Very addictive!!",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114106152376985360330/reviews
Richard Cheah,1,"An unforgettable experience which I will never again patronize this bakery shop again.

During one of my work at home schedule last week, due to limited options available, I make my way here to purchase their chicken bun for afternoon tea break snack. To my horrid, when I finished the first bun, the chicken meat was only one quarter of the length for overall bun. Thinkng it was a one off, I consumed my second bun after finishing the first. This time, my temperature immediately hit boiling point after finishing half the bun. There was no meat available and feeling something amissed, I immediately tore open the remainder of the bun only to discover the chicken meat is only about one centimeter. In case, you think it is an error, I emphasize again, which is a miserable ""LONG MEAT OF 1 CM"" out of the whole bun.

Well, this is the last you will ever get to earn my money. No way I will ever buy another bun or bread or cake from this bakery shop again.

Just wonder, when will this shop be closing down?",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116759225490774107700/reviews
Juipin Ang,1,"SCAMMER BAKERY

Bought 2 breads for $2.80, i gave the cashier lady $5 note and asked her to wait while i get 80 cents from my purse. Got her the 80 cents and she insisted that i gave her a $2 note before and refused to pay change.

Ended up paying $5.80 for 2 horrible tasting breads...

Gek Mui Ho,1,"Very disappointed with this bakery. On my 3rd time order for another birthday celebration, it is very unfortunate that an unforeseen event happened in my family which forced us to cancel the celebration.

I quickly called the bakery to cancel my order, 2 days ahead of the collection day. However, the owner of bakery refused, stating they make the cake 2 days in advance for collectionâ€¦!! I was in the state of disbelief!

How am I to do with a birthday cake in this difficult (sad) time? There is no good reasoning and empathy.

I hope this feedback will help everyone, if there is a real need to cancel any order with them.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115581669143889916242/reviews
Florence Ho,5,"Bought a small chocolate cake for Birthday  for $15 and was very surprised how good it taste! I usually only eat one, but I ate another slice.  Although cake deco looks is a bit old school on the outside,  cake texture is just right and the cream is fresh and not so sweet. Hard to find nice chocolate sponge like this. Will definitely come back again.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111703827877920950270/reviews
