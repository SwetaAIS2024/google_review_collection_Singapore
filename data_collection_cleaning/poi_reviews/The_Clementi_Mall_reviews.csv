Amirul Akmal,1,"Been stuck at parking bay around 30-40 minutes today 24/12/2024. No one from management mall come up to see what happen. Mom and children need walk at dangerous hall way to go into mall. A very long que outside. Not recommnded to bring family to this mall, rather WCP, JEM or WG. The management mall staff didnt do their job.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109556689716255389468/reviews

Hao Tan,4,"Quite a big mall with 3 levels and a basement. Crowded with locals coming to do errands like banking etc. There a supermarket, few banks, Post office and even a national library.  Quite impressed with the mall facilities. There are many restaurants and eateries within the mall. There other foods options at the neighbourhood nearby. Located at Clementi Interchange and Train station hence its easy to locate. A good shopping place to visit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117487638688399238932/reviews
