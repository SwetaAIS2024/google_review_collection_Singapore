Dawn Tan,2,"The attending doctor, See Shean Yaw, didn't seem attentive nor interested in giving a proper/thorough consult. Barely looked at me, didn't even check my throat even though I said I had a sore throat.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106495627610493079167/reviews
Angie Lim,1,"I went to Halley Medical Clinic as it us nearer to my house this morning. I am having bad cough, flu and fever. The relief doctor was diagnosed me less than one minute. He didn’t even hear my lung or ask me to breath in and out properly. When I went back home and I realised that he didn’t prescript cough medicine to me. I have no choice but made the trip back to this clinic. The receptionist was giving me poor service and black face when I requested to change another cough medicine. Wonder if it is due to costs that they gave me infants cough medicine. As patient and customer, i have the rights to request for other cough medicine that suits me. I strongly discourage to recommend this clinic to my friends and family.
They should choose their relief doctor more thoroughly. Otherwise, it will definitely ruin their reputation.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110649621542134038487/reviews
Lim Xin Yi,1,"I saw the doctor 2 weeks ago and today I went down to the clinic again, wanting to ask for more medicine for my morning sickness without consultation as I saw that there was a long queue. The counter lady (an indian lady) could have went in to ask for the doctor (Dr Winston Lin)'s approval to prescribe me the medicine in between patients but she simply refused to and just took her own sweet time and did her own things and made me waited for nearly an hour. When she finally got the approval and after I made my payment, while she was preparing the medicine (which took another 15 mins), seeing that she might take a while, I went to the washroom. When I returned to the clinic to collect my medicine, she actually told me she cancelled my order cause I didn't tell her I went to the washroom! I mean hello, I waited for an hour and already made my payment, is she in her right mind to think that I will just walk off like that?! So in the end I waited 1hr for NOTHING. Thanks Halley Medical Clinic for the ""GREAT"" service.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108253252329386452819/reviews
Steven Foh,5,"This clinic has been my family's preferred clinic. Personal opinion,  any clinics,  doctors are most important as we're dependant on them towards our recovery. Generally,  doctors have been providing us good medical care, sensitive and listens to our needs, helpful as well as cost effective and the counter staff are many times better than those in block 982. The best doctor without denial will be Dr Winston.
Keep up the good work!",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102379155230760476421/reviews
CC CC,1,"Too many BAD experiences from Counter Staff
1) Doctors are good, counter and reception staff are horrible. Rude, and uninterested ...not helpful when questions asked. They either show irritation or reluctant to answer.

2) GAVE WRONG INSTRUCTIONS WHEN DISPENSING MEDICINE...Luckily I am in the healthcare industry and asked again twice to the nurse who dispensed the medicines for me. They looked very uncertain when I questioned them initially and so, I insisted that they double check with the doctor as the instructions they gave seemed different from what the doctor had advised earlier. True enough, the nurses almost got me to apply the body eczema cream (a much stronger dosage) to my face...and vice versa for other creams given...all mixed up. I should have made a complaint to HCI (Healthcare Institution) for Wrong Dispense of medicinal instructions & if nothing works to escalate to 2nd level. Anyway..I told the counter staff that they need to exercise caution when dispensing medications to patients and disappointing enough, they did not even apologize and stared at me point blank.

The medical doctors and management better start looking into improving the process...& providing BASIC customer service trainings if they want to continue serving patients.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110016154971903954133/reviews
