Vijay K,1,"I go take materials from Eunos, no issue.
Come to Terusan, workers talking rude and ask me to wait even if I am the only one in the queue, no other customers.
My salesman told me he informed Terusan workers to help pack already in my company group yesterday, but today I come, no one pack my item yet and your Terusan workers tell me ""just wait"".
Please improve your service.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106741654625596594905/reviews
Myst Maryam,1,Extremely rude staff! Driver of XD***0T felt he owned the public carpark and therefore all vehicles must “siam” to give him all the space he needed! Use threatening and vulgar words to demoralised other drivers as he felt entitled to have the entire carpark space to himself! The carpark is there to pick up and drop preschoolers but this entitled imbecile did not park the lorry in the assigned loading and unloading space but rather parked anyhow he liked and obstruct other motorists!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112362302901519682729/reviews
