What I love about the mattress is that it can be easily configure to your comfort zones in a multiple ways at any time. While I was lying on the mattress itself, I felt that cushy comfort feel. It‚Äôs so great. Right now, they are having a Christmas Promotion. What are you waiting for? Come on down to 33 Ubi Avenue 3, #01-71 Vertex showroom to see it for yourself and feel the comfy mattresses. You wont regret at all. Also, you can purchase Christmas gift for your family, friends and your colleagues too. I recommend these to everyone out thereüëçüèª Follow them on Instagram too @hallmarkbeds",

      "text": "I bought my tencel queen fitted sheet set from them for about $98 during their EOY sale, so worth it for a queen size! it is also the best tencel set I have compared to another brand! This sheet does not make my hair fall as much as the others, 3 days worth of hair on this sheet is equal to 1 day worth of hair compared to my other tencel and bamboo sheets! It is also more durable than my other sheets, almost as durable as cotton which means it dry faster and can withstand machine washes better! my other sheets already have lint pile up and tiny threads coming out and they dry sooo slowly! i will definitely buy from them again if I were to ever need a house warming gift, one of the best bed sheets I‚Äôve ever had!",
