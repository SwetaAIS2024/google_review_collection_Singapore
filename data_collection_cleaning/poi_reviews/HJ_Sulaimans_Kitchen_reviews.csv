Benson Tan,1,"Ordered plain bee hoon goreng which they had cooked and displayed. Chose tahu goreng, bagedil, hotdog, tempeh and chicken wing. Total $10.50.
I asked for price breakdown, the lady said bee hoon $2.50, hotdog $2… i stopped listening when she said hotdog $2. There was about 7-8 pieces of hotdog only.. $2???!!! Seriously?
I know f&b rental high, overheads all that high. But freaking $2 for 7-8 pieces CUT HOTDOGS? That’s like only about 2 pieces of whole hotdogs! I commented $2 very expensive but i paid anyway as i did not want to cause any trouble or hold up the queue.
The food was oily and bee hoon was cold. Chicken wing was not well marinated, only the skin tasted some turmeric and the insides were bland. Not worth $10.50 at all.
Please look into your pricing.. it’s crazily expensive and charge rightfully!
Definately not recommended and this is the last $10.50 you’ll be getting from me.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110968066148220734204/reviews
Faizal Rahman,5,"The best Tahu Goreng that I’ve tasted. Very flavorful tofu (huge) and it’s the peanut gravy that’s the star of this dish. The right balance of sweetness & spiciness … superb umami flavor 👍😋 … Not forgetting their delicious Lontong … the rice cake is of the right texture .. the gravy, Sambal Tumis and serunding tops off this delightful dish 😋👍",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103784146025651006794/reviews

Will K,3,"It's okay, a bit on the salty side.
The colour and consistency of the gravy looks different from the previous reviews.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100473319674032987985/reviews
