Disposal gloves provided so yeah!\n\n- Classic Prawn Noodles $8.90 - we had the dry version with a nice sweet and savour sauce. This version uses a regular size prawn and is partially peeled already.\n\nAlso tried the Golden Prawn Roll side dish that came with yummy chilli!\n\nOverall really love the freshness of the Prawns, prawns ball and the broth was super good. Rich and flavourful with no after effects like thirstiness!\n\n100% retuning for more! Highly recommended!\n\nHighly recommended!",

You can customise everything—big or regular prawns, yellow noodles, kway teow, or mee hoon, dry or soup—and the broth is rich and flavourful. Don’t skip their sides: the Signature Fried Prawn and Golden Prawn Pancake were crispy and addictive. Hawker space is clean with plenty of seating despite the crowd. Great find for prawn-mee fans!",
