Joanne,5,"As a big sourdough bread lover (and former home baker) it took us some time to find a good bakery in Singapore.
At MICRO red house we found what we wanted and we have been regulars stocking up sourdough every couple of weeks.

Besides their sourdough, their baguettes are very good, as well as the selection of pastries and breads they sell. Staff is amazing, especially Lisa who I could also text to reserve an order.

All in all, we‚Äôre big fans of the team at MICRO red house and their menu! Would highly recommend visiting if you are in the area.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108871482403285006160/reviews
Bobby Green,5,"Absolutely delightful experience! The sourdough was perfectly crusty and full of flavor, paired beautifully with expertly cooked eggs. The gingerbread brownie was a showstopper‚Äîrich, spiced, and utterly unforgettable. The grilled cheese sandwich? Simply stunning, with a gooey, cheesy center and a perfectly crisp exterior. To top it off, they offer free water, which is a thoughtful touch. A must-visit for anyone who loves quality food and attention to detail!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105668761295106041043/reviews
Xia Lucy,5,Our favourite neighbourhood bakery! All baks are delicious but fig and cream cheese ciabatta is my fav. Their coffee is quite good too. Can get quite crowded in the morning though so be prepared to queue for a bit.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107845510626349399679/reviews
Leville,5,"Friendly staff greeted us the moment we stepped in. Tables are close to each other as the space is quite small. Food is decent and quite a nice variety of choices. One of the more famous cafes in Katong area. Very distinct red paint on the outside. Can‚Äôt miss this place if you are around the area. Outdoor seating available too. Not too suitable on a hot afternoon. But for morning breakfast or brunch it‚Äôs totally ok. Overall a very nice cafe with good food and pastries and coffee. Barista looks experienced and coffee is on point. Only grouse is that it‚Äôs a bit overpriced for my liking, but which eatery is not nowadays? üëÄ Visit on a weekday or non peak period cos lots of people come here to eat. It‚Äôs one of the tourist attractions around the area. 328 Katong Laksa and the famous Sri Senpaga Temple is just round the corner.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112553288126923768878/reviews
Andrean Priadi,5,"Micro Bakery Red House | Katong

Came across this bakery while walking around the Katong/Joo Chiat area and decided to give it a try. Micro Bakery offers a wide range of breads, pastries, and brunch food. I got their famous sourdough and also tried their pastry and cake. They provide free water.

Big Breakfast ($27.00)
Love the sourdough and the creamy scrambled eggs. The sausage is flavourful and the mushrooms are well seasoned. The dish is accompanied by fresh salad that adds a delightful crunchiness. Butter, salt, and pepper are provided on the side.

Croissant ($4.00)
The croissant is crispy and flaky on the exterior. It has nice buttery taste.

Banana Walnut Cake ($6.50)
They are generous with the banana and walnuts, The cake has a nice sweetness from the bananas, complemented by the crunch of the walnuts.

Worth a Try
‚úÖ Definitely Returning!
Must-Visit!
