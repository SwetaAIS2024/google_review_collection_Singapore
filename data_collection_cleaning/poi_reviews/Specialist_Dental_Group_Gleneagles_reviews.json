      "text": "Before coming to SDG, I had an immense fear of the dentist and never visited the dentist for almost 10 years. So you could imagine the bad state my teeth were in.\n\nAfter seeing Dr Edwin Tan, his patience and gentleness have helped me to overcome this fear I had. When I first visited him, he knew I was really scared. So he took things really slowly and fixed my teeth 1 by 1. He would always ask if I am okay and if I needed him to stop the procedure. After 10 over sessions, my teeth is finally fixed and I can even handle extractions now. Extractions and recovery process were painless.\n\nAlso, not forgetting the assistants/nurses. They are very caring. One of them was very sensitive to my fears on the 1st session. She saw that I was still tearing and held my hand throughout the entire session to comfort me.\n\nThe price...this is a private clinic so it is expected. I spent over $10k for all my procedures in total. But it was worth it - I took it as though I paid for the dental works and psychology sessions to overcome the fear. I am really thankful for Dr Tan and can now visit the dentist without fear anymore (:",
