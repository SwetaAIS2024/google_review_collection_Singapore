Diced chicken tender and juicy, croissant soft and fluffy, the mushroom was the just the right consistency and perfectly flavoured. Wiped everything off my plates for the first time. Portion quite big, price very reasonable especially compared to other cafes. Really a gem! Will be back",

      "text": "The place is nestle alongside other nice cafes and eateries in Eco-Botanic and is easy to find, with lots of parking. We came a little after lunch and the place was fairly empty with only 1 or 2 tables seated.\n\nI loved the ambience and the effort put in for the decor! The whole place is spacious and nicely lit from the natural lights from the street (big glass door) and good use of warm lighting.\n\nFood was just as splendid. We had the fish and chips, spicy cheesy spaghetti, steaky beef breakfast and creamy pumpkin farfelle with beef bacon. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. Oh.. and the fries are really good too.\n\nI had a black coffee after meal and one of the better coffee I’ve ever had.\n\nLast, we had tiramisu for dessert and it was not too bad.\n\nHighly recommended to come here if you looking for a nice cafe to chill or for a good lunch.",

      "text": "A charming, quiet little spot—ideal for winding down before or after a massage. The service was warm and attentive, which added a nice touch to the experience. I also appreciated the availability of Wi-Fi and a comfortable working area, making it a decent place to catch up on some work.\n\nI tried the iced matcha, but the milk was too overpowering, leaving little of the matcha flavour to shine through. I also had the basque cheesecake—served warm and oozing with chocolate, but the taste was just average, and the portion felt small for the price.\n\nLovely ambience and service, but the food and drinks didn’t quite live up to expectations.",
