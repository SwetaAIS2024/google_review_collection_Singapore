Jason Lee,5,"Optician (the boss) is friendly and skillful (years of experience). I made a spec with long and short sightedness in my lens and had some difficulty adjusting to it. I went back for adjustment and he replace my lens FREE of charge.

He was not defensive nor did he blame me; he understood why it's difficult to adjust as he had years of experience and the new lens with that slight adjustment had really helped me in getting used to my new lens. This shop is ethical, friendly and the boss is patient to explain thoroughly. Plus the prices are reasonable and his recommendation for my lens is spot on. Highly recommended!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103026301809587742390/reviews
James Wong,5,"I'd known this optical shop owner Mr. Steven Koh for quite sometimes as I'm staying in the neighbourhood for almost 30 yrs.
I did engaged other's Optical shops before as there're three at West Plaza.
What make Mr Steven standout from the rest is his patience and getting the best for your eyes during the checking and testing stage.
Even though his shop was hidden from view, he was able to maintain good and royal relationship with his customers.
I highly recommend Mr Steven if you need his services...",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111340779875951121765/reviews
