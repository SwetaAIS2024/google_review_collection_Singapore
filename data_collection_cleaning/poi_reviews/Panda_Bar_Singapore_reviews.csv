Valerie Lim,1,"It’s a bar for customers to sing in an open space. However, you have no opportunity to sing as people would just cut your song as and when they deem fit. Staff will not meddle and in fact entertain tables that do not follow the rules. They changed their menu recently and you won’t feel like ordering their food",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113038313355985045817/reviews
Bosco Lim Hearted Moments,5,"The food is tasty, and within a good price range! Nice ambience for family and friends gathering, even come with table karaoke, where everyone get to sing and entertain one another!

The boss and staff is very nice too! Always smiling and helpful. Looking forward to the next time :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114838669339026162946/reviews
Jocelyn Bay,1,"Honestly, the atmosphere isn’t great. people were screaming and shouting constantly. I understand that it’s a bar for people to sing in the hall, but the level of screaming in high pitch voice is quite a bummer. Food isn’t as great as before. You can go if you don’t mind hurting your ear drums.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105206401264210862536/reviews
Mr T,5,"Food was tasty.. selected a few that I highly recommend.
the 串烧 variety is not very wide. But was good.
You can play the pool or sing along with the songs.
Enjoy the beer as the price is lower and get a night valet home after.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115494316052728088429/reviews
