CC,1,Very unpleasant experience. This rude auntie started to yell and chase me out on the dot at 4:30pm. Iâ€™m not even late. She could have politely inform me that they are closing the section. The signage is so small. Make it bigger if you are so particular about it. Whatâ€™s with the lousy service when the pastry is not even nice.

Leon Kwang,1,"Need some attention to keeping out flies.. which i saw them try with fly swappers .. are there no better ways (to stop them from getting in)? I guess f&b faces all sorts of challenges.

Anyway, I initially wanted to but didn't buy this time round after seeing the fly visit various buns.. but i guess I've been eating the same all these while without seeing the fly ðŸª° for myself! Haha.. I'll always come back to support them.. I like their buns.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews
Reiko H,4,"So Good was the taste of the egg tarts at So Good Bakeryâ€¦ simply so good that you keep wanting for more, it was simply irresistible that I forgot to keep a photo of the egg tart. Wide range of bakes to choose from and the beauty of this bakery is that it is ideally located at the corner and one will never miss it. The wide array of selections coupled with reasonable price points, why hold back and not give their bakes a bite!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116368562396787087469/reviews
Flo G,5,"So good bakery offers a good variety of bread, cakes, Hong Kong pastries.

Often attracted by the fresh bake aroma and appealing breads and canâ€™t resist but take some home.

Tried the curry bread & crispy cream cheese bun, both very yummy.

The curry bun has generous authentic curry potato fillings with a fragrant crust. Tasted good even when kept overnight.

Crispy cream cheese bun has a flaky dough and tasty cream cheese filling, very well balanced overall.

Recommend to take home for tea time or breakfastâ€¦.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews
littlebitofnoms,5,"Amazing Hongkong-style bakery in Singapore, located at 100 AM Mall in Tanjong Pagar. They have the best salt breads in Singapore, it is so buttery inside, nice and crunchy on the outside, and has the right amount of saltiness! I love to freeze it at home, and when I reheat I sprinkle some water on top and bake in the airfryer for 6 minutes. It is heavenly, definitely recommend trying their salt bread. Super satisfying.

They also have great bolo buns and sugar donuts!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105189557995353438074/reviews
