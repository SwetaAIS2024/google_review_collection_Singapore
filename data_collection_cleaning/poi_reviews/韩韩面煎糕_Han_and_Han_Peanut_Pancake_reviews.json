      "text": "Exceptional find in a neighborhood market. This is the chewy type MJK which is freshly made upon ordering. Highly recommend to eat this while it’s hot for the perfectly crispy “wings”. Generous dollop of the peanut spread which has a crunchy peanut butter consistency. The pancake thickness is just right as well - has a good, soft bouncy bite to it. Craving this again as I am typing out this review!",
