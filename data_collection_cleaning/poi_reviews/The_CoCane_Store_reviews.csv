ebLiNk bLiNk,5,"Awesome Teh Tarik, most important, the taste is consistent. Every time we are at the food centre, we will definitely order their Teh Tarik, never a taste of disappointment.

Other cold drinks are equally good!

Additionally, it feels really warming to see the family run the Cocane Store, to see their closeness and happiness. :)",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103197305467042960286/reviews
Playboi Yan,1,Ordered a sugarcane from them and the sugarcane looks damn horrific. Itâ€™s so dark and it looks very weird. Went to ask him to change the drink he came back and add lemons. Claiming they changed the drink still looks the same. Gave me a new one but it still looks the same,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106373834405888747044/reviews
jonpl,5,"Had the Donald Trump. I have never drank such a good drink in my life... I feel hopeless after this, like my life has peaked and it's all downhill from here. I love this place for providing me with this experience but I can't help but resent them for the nihilism I now feel. Overall I recommend this place come here if ur in east coast pakr.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106613439026397053333/reviews
