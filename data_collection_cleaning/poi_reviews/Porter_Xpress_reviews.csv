Denise Bosley,5,"A great service to leave baggage with them at cruise terminal and pick up at airport, leaving us free to enjoy day in Singapore. Was dead on time with great communication.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117085529504778608430/reviews
Blake Thompson,5,"We used Porter Express for transfers from the airport and around Singapore to our golf days. Honestly, if it wasn't for their hospitality and outstanding service our trip would not have been so great. They literally go over and above to make sure you're looked after. Couldn't recommend enough
Thanks again Porter Xpress
PS. James you're a legend!
