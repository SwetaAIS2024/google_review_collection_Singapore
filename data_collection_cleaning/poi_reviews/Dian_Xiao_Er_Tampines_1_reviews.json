      "text": "Dian Xiao Er (Tampines 1): A Delicious and Value-Packed Chinese Feast (5/5 Stars)\n\nRating:\n\n• Atmosphere: 4/5 (Clean and comfortable setting, perfect for a casual dining experience)\n\n• Food Quality: 5/5 (Delicious and flavorful Chinese dishes, especially the duck roasted with ten wonder herbs, fish maw soup, and marmite chicken thigh)\n\n• Service: 5/5 (Excellent and friendly service, with patient and helpful staff)\n\n• Value: 5/5 (Great value for money, with generous promotions and a variety of dishes)\n\nOverall: 5/5\n\nMy girlfriend and I surprised Donkey and our friend with a birthday dinner at Dian Xiao Er (Tampines 1), and it was a wonderful experience. We were initially drawn to the Dian Xiao Er membership promotions, which offered great value through e-vouchers and discounts on their signature Herbal Roast Duck. The promotions require a new mobile number for the initial free Platinum Membership sign-up, and offer immediate redemption. After some discussion, we decided to go for the \"Signature Set for 4,\" which also offered a great value. The set included delicious dishes like the duck roasted with ten wonder herbs, deep-fried Kai Lan with floss, fish maw thick soup, marmite chicken thigh, and steamed fish slices. We were especially impressed with the variety of dishes, which allowed us to sample different flavors and textures. We particularly enjoyed the duck roasted with ten wonder herbs, the fish maw soup, and the Marmite chicken thigh, which were all incredibly flavorful.\n\nWe also ordered barley, soothing autumn pear drinks, and a Tiger beer to round out our meal.\n\nThe service was fantastic, the staff were patient and helpful, and they were also quite efficient. We didn't have to wait long before all the food was served to us, which is always appreciated, especially when a restaurant is busy. I had questions about the membership promotions and how to sign up through the app, and they were happy to explain everything and answer all our questions.\n\nDespite the restaurant being busy during dinner, our overall experience at Dian Xiao Er was great. We all had a wonderful time celebrating our birthdays. If you're looking for a delicious Chinese meal with excellent service and generous promotions, I highly recommend giving Dian Xiao Er a try. They offer a great selection of dishes, and the staff is friendly and helpful.",

      "text": "Their food is always consistently delicious.\n\nWe went for the CNY set during CNY. The price point is rather reasonable. The set does include rice which is a plus point as well. They have also a fair distribution of meat too, which is great.\n\nHowever, their tables seems to be too small, not enough to place all the dishes on the table, for 7 pax. This is not really acceptable for a restaurant meant for family reunions.",
