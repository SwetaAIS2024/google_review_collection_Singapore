Jezel Yeo,4,Tomato soup was delicious and we loved the bread that came with it. Carbonara was very nice and creamy. Truffle fries came with mayo which we really liked as well. Service was a bit slow but servers were nice and friendly. We love coming here when we are at terminal 4.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105218198370800163960/reviews
M Chua,5,"Waiting for our flight, so we got a coffee to enjoy the ambiance at this cafe. The coffee is amazing, very rich and smooth, and the two gentlemen Akif and Muhaimim on duty were extremely kind and thoughtful and gave my mother a cup of warm water because she was cold. We'll be sure to visit again next time we are here! ðŸ˜Š

CK C,3,Food and coffee were poor in quality. Service was slow as the restaurant was understaffed. Tricky if you are rushing for a flight. Nice environment though.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
