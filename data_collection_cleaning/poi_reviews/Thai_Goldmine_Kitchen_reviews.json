      "text": "The place is seriously one of the best Thai places I’ve been to in Singapore!\nFor one, the tom yum is friggin amazing! Thick, flavourful and not salty at all. The generous amount of seafood and mushrooms inside are yet another good point for this dish.\nThe basil pork was also really great, bearing a satisfyingly flavourful punch of basil.\nThe instant noodle salad was also somehow absolutely delicious. Marinated without being overly soggy or salty, they went well with the seafood served with it.\nThe vegetables were nicely cooked and sauced, crisp and savoury.\nThe shrimp cakes were, surprisingly, made out of actual shrimp, which was a nice surprise. Anyway, they also tasted great.\nThe milk tea and the rice was nice, but nothing really outstanding.\n\nAll in all, one of the best Thai places on this island. I would definitely recommend going here to eat, but as seating is limited, I would advise to get a booking beforehand.",

      "text": "Popped by for a quick meal for two pax. We were welcomed at the door by one of the young men working there. First impression was pleasant! At least it felt like a genuine warm welcome.\n\nFood was served pretty quick. We had a Tomyam soup and basil chicken, even though we would’ve loved basil Pork instead. On top of that, we also had 2 glasses of Thai milk tea!\n\nLoved the milk tea, it was fragrant, not too sweet and just $2 a glass. Also really appreciate the fact that it came without straws. Server made an effort to highlight that they are trying to go green by excluding straws. Of which , we greatly welcome!\n\nOverall it cost us $22 for this dinner pictured below (without the teas though!)",
