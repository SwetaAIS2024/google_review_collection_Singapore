So you could have a meal with free tea here for less than $5 here (gst inclusive)\n\nOn this visit, we ordered a unagi don, curry rice set with chicken karaage, and a low-carb gyudon (rice replaced by tofu) for $30.30.\n\nThe unagi don was a bit dry, and I would suggest ordering it with half boiled egg.\n\nThe curry rice was a little bit spicy for us but  helped to lift the appetite.\n\nThe low-carb gyudon is good for the health conscious and tasted alright.",
