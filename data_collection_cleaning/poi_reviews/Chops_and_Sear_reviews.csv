Venny Juliana,4,"$ 5 rice bowl for takeaway, cheap and complete nutrition in a bowl. Chicken a bit too salty for me, and overcooked, but still munchable, not too tough too bite. Butter rice taste like chicken rice, savoury and flavourful.

One star less for the waiting time. I guess they made the order one by one, so take longer time to serve our order.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114070569380434404874/reviews

Jason Nah,2,"Food is ok but I realized they went to NTUC to buy frozen vegetables to defrost & Shing siong to buy the chicken.

It took so long & the boss had yet told me that the rice bowl takes time for the rice to cook. To add insult to injury, they left my bowl on their counter & didn’t ring the buzzer

In all I waited 30 mins for a bowl of cold food. Wow, did they graduate from Gordon Ramsay’s school of Bangladesh cooking?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101808794582553432521/reviews
Kanishka Randunu,3,"Situated inside the bedok marketplace @58. They have a good variation on pasta, bolognese, fish and chips, agio olio and salmon, chicken and other dishes. But the food preparation time was high. had to wait long to get my chicken bolognese ready although the shops wasn't much busy. Taste was fine. Portion size was ""just"" enogh for one person. Chicken bolognese costed S$ 6.80.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112160003419585301353/reviews
C L,5,"Located at coffeeshop. Serves a huge variety of western food, pastas, burgers and sides. Can see the chaps working very hard for this business. Food is of very good quality, and very importantly, looks exactly like what you see in the photos. Same aesthetics, same size portions so you are not shortchanged at all unlike some other nearby western food stalls claiming to be the BEST (ahem!). Highly recommend!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100389401089113866419/reviews
