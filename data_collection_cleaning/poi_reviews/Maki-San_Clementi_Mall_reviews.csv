Andrew Tan,1,"A Masterclass in Minimalism – Bravo, Makisan!

Wow, just wow. If you're ever in the mood to spend good money for what feels like a half-hearted appetizer, Makisan is the place to go. I ordered a salad with yakiniku beef and even splurged an extra $4 for a grand total of five microscopic pieces of unagi. I would have asked for a magnifying glass to find them, but sadly, that wasn’t on the menu.

The yakiniku beef? Two lonely slices so thin and sad, they looked like they missed their friends. As for the egg mayo, it was served with surgical precision – one dainty spoonful, probably measured by a jeweler. And the asparagus? Seven stalks, clearly rationed like it’s wartime.

The real kicker? The bowl was barely half full. Maybe Makisan is secretly a diet service and this is all part of their minimalist culinary philosophy. Either way, I left feeling both hungry and scammed.

Would I order again? Only if I’m preparing to fast.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109084752210621739246/reviews
Sherry Yap,1,"Have been buying makisan mega san bowl from clementi mall for a very long time and was disappointed with the inconsistency in food quality. The portion of rice, pasta and lettuce varied significantly with each order, and during one visit, the rice was undercooked.

In the picture you can see that the amount given for both bowls is different.

I hope the restaurant can improve the consistency and standards of their dishes in the future.
Thank you for your attention.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117523489397535615563/reviews
Zo ea,4,"Got the smoked tuna Mega Makisan (11.10 SGD). It tasted like your average sushi roll, but some parts had less tuna than others so I can't say it's the best. Portion was more than enough for 1 person so that's the only plus point.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111344332602871678595/reviews

A Goh,1,"Really bad meal. Ordered a Mega San salad bowl - the avocados had gone rancid, it was sour. I had to dig it out from my bowl & dump it. A look at the reviews; I am not the first to comment on the rotten avocados. The fried food was cold. For those at the mall, you’ll be better off at Stuff’d for freshness and value. Cashier staff was impolite and can barely managed a smile or word despite greeting her. Transaction completed in true silent mode and deciphering her eye gestures.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104975154040273856080/reviews
