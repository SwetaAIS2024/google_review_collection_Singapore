One of my favorite dishes whenever I go to a mala place is to try their tomato egg dish (haha I know itâ€™s lame) cause I like the simplicity of the dish. Well they did that great and also this pork with quail egg, so fatty and heavenly melt in your mouth haha. They have all your favorite mala dishes (see the photo). I plan to try their other dishes but the if the ones we tried are any indication it will be the bomb ðŸ˜‹!",
