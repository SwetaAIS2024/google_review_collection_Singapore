      "text": "I recently visited and had an amazing dining experience. I ordered the tomato seafood pasta, truffle mushroom pasta, and fresh oysters, and each dish was outstanding. The seafood pasta was loaded with fresh, tender seafood and had a rich, flavorful sauce. The truffle pasta was creamy and indulgent, with just the right amount of truffle to elevate the dish. As for the oysters, they were incredibly fresh, briny, and served perfectly chilled.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was cozy and welcoming. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for high-quality seafood and pasta dishes. I'll definitely be returning soon!",

The tom yam sauce was a bit too mild for my taste. The pork meat stuck to the bone, making it hard to eat. But, the ambiance was warm and inviting, perfect for casual dining.",
