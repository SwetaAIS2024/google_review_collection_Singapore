Rachel Chua,1,"Room was very cold, told the staff, can't do anything as it was centralised but I think everyone else dinning felt the same way so should have just adjusted either way. One group even went outside to sit instead.

Food was bad and we waited so long for the food. We ordered around 7pm but only left close to 9pm, more than half the time spent waiting for food.

Never had such bad zichar especially at their price point. Only the crab promo was worth it and at least edible. The rest not so much. We paid for a steamed red grouper for $80 before taxes but the fish was tough and not tender.

Other than the two, we ordered tequila chicken, dragon chives, pork ribs, XO fried rice, drunken prawns, caipoh beancurd. Only the XO fried rice was good. Others was the worst I had comparing to other zichars.

During payment, we were even charged additional fried rice which we didn't order. Was lucky I spotted it if not we would have been charged for it.

Will never go back.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116793655201357469813/reviews
Joanne Yap,5,"Nice food and service. Love it.
The Halibut fish is a big portion and definitely worth the price. We ordered garlic baked cran and white pepper crab. It was fantastic. The cooking style suits my picky taste bud. Prices are reasonable. We will be back!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103764637704674067516/reviews
Min0406,5,"The crab promotion is definitely VERY worth! 3 for $45! We enjoyed the garlic baked crab so much. The ribeye was also amazing as it came with the wedges and fried kway teow. A 250g set should feed 2 adults very well. The restaurant also had many seats available. Would recommend anyone in the area to try.

Food takes quite awhile to cook, but honestly not a very big deal for us.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109567683121704618656/reviews
Michael TAN,4,"The food is typically Malaysia style cooking. If you like to go to Malaysia for cooked food, this is a good place to go without crossing the border. Love the brinjal, mackerel fish and duck. The best was the pickled pumpkin passion fruit. I do not recommend the chendol. It‚Äôs so watered down with too much coconut milk and it was not cold. I will definitely come back to this restaurant.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106408988733162382676/reviews
CheeSiong Tan,5,Celebrating my dad 80th birthday at West Legend. We booked a private room for our family celebration. The service is warm and attentive. The dishes we ordered are nice as they are quite innovative on the menu. Sotong we had is very fresh and appetising.. My parent enjoyed the dinning experience and the food. üëç,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112835821723583932324/reviews
