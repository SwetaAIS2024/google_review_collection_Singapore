Ade Lew,5,"My daughter brought me to Moon restaurant as i have craving for seafood. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, with soft lighting and a colossal moon looming overhead, as if torn from the sky and hung from the ceiling.

The service was exceptional—attentive without being intrusive. An qi was friendly, knowledgeable, and made thoughtful recommendations that perfectly matched our tastes.

As for the food, every dish was a standout. We started with oysters which were really juicy and fresh.  I had my lobster and my daughter had wagyu steak. She loved to have her steak rare and it was indeed cooked to her liking. Both of us loved the truffles fries. We will go again to try their crispy pork belly and other dishes.

Overall, Moon restaurant exceeded expectations in every way. Whether you’re looking for a drinking session, a celebration spot, or simply a great meal, I’d highly recommend it.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108970542564967852893/reviews
Adelyn Tan,5,"Welcome to Singapore's only moon-themed bar. Dive into Golden hour magic and rooftop dreams. 🌙✨ Moon Rooftop Bar is an intimate space with a rare blend of quiet elegance and cheeky charm. It swept us off our feet with its perfect blend of city skyline views and aesthetically dreamy moonlit charm. Enjoy amazing dinners, great convos and playful vibes.

Our picks:
🍹 Shiny Moon & Cinderella cocktails – vibrant, refreshing and delightfully flavourful.
🍕 Signature prata-crust pizza – insanely good plus the amazing cheese pull when warm
🦪 Fresh Japanese Oysters topped with salmon caviar – pure ocean bliss
🥗 Spicy salmon salad & grilled squid –perfect for seafood lovers like us
🥓 Crispy pork belly – hear that crunch in each bite
🐖 Grilled kurobuta pork – suprisingly melt-in-your-mouth tender

The ambience? A seamless mix of laid-back elegance and playful vibes—perfect for lingering conversations or a romantic date night. We planned for a quick dinner but stayed longer than planned, captivated by the view, savouring every bite and the kind of spot where conversations just flows. No frills—just genuine moments in an enchanting escape from the everyday.  and filling our hearts (and camera rolls) with joy it is just so-Instagrammable. 📸💕",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104415768088659362270/reviews
JATHL,5,"The views here are pretty spectacular! Very serene when it’s not crowded. A bit pricey but I guess you can justify it as paying for the ambiance and views.
Service by the two ladies was very friendly and accommodating.
I would say it’s a great place for drinks with friends or on a date, although their Guinness tap might need a flush/servicing. The margarita I had was good, albeit a touch too sweet. The martini glass rim was half-salted, which is a touch I appreciate.
I cannot in good conscience, recommend the food though. I tried the Australian Wagyu and although it wasn’t a disaster, it just didn’t seem like wagyu. Maybe a 1/4 breed at best. It was also a thin cut, served blue with a grey band and a mediocre sear. A decent steak from a coffee shop “western food stall” but not at a $48++ price tag. Sorry, just “keeping it real”.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110357299060106350854/reviews

Maxime,2,"The view is pretty great (when it's not raining).
Cocktails are bad. Whisky sour top egg white foam smelled somewhat rotten. The price is your standard SGD 25/ cocktail before tax which makes it all the more painful since there are plenty of great cocktail bars in the area.
If I return I'll have a beer or something that cannot be missed out.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102521771507302215819/reviews
