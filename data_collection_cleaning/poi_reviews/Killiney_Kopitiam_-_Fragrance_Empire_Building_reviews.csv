C.K.,1,"On 30th Dec 2024, around 9am+ encountered 1 very rude staff and 1 very unprofessional staff. The unprofessional staff washed the boiled eggs with cold water so that his hands don’t get “burnt” as what he told me. Then when served the eggs were cold so I complained, and then another staff overheard this made very sarcastic remark that the eggs are cold because I took my own sweet time finding the change , this is damn rude ! Instead of apologetic , they simply ignored my complaint that the eggs were served cold . Will never patronise this place ever again !",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114133438897013181791/reviews
Jansen Ong,1,Service is rude. Too many Malaysian Work Permit holders and Vietnamese. Making the place low class and uneducated. Rude staffs and slow service. Think twice before coming again. Choose other outlets. Or just dine at ARC.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101791623657480710000/reviews
Willard Emmanuel,5,"Located on the ground floor of Fragrance Empire Building. Serves my favourite traditional Singaporean-style Fried Carrot Cake and local coffee (Kopi-O). Food quality is good, consistent and service is very prompt and friendly! It can be very packed during lunch due to the limited space available. Various e-payment modes available.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102808710762193271941/reviews
Yi Jing Choy,3,The only thing here worth seems to be the Nasi Lemak. The Hor Fun (pictured) lacks the distinct burnt taste of Hor Fun. Decent for a noodle meal but not really worth the price.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109356826254459559655/reviews
