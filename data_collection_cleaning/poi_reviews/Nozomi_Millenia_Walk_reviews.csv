IamDrew1979,5,"This is our first time patronising this restaurant and not our last for sure. The servers were helpful and attentive. The food are fresh and well presented.
The overall experience was awesome. üëçüëçüëç

We ordered Salmon Mentaiyaki Bento, Unagi Chasoba Bento, Hokkaido Hotate mentai pasta and the Sashimi platter - 7 types of sashimi with Hokkaido Uni. The Bento set was well portioned and delicious. The Sashimi is fresh and juicy. The uni melted in the mouth.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115883410990420150278/reviews
Clement Cher,5,"First time doing a walk in to the following restaurant. The staff were pleasant and helpful and were knowledgeable on their menu items

Ordered the dinner set which comes with a dessert at the end. The portion seems huge for small eaters but surprisingly it was just nice. Highlights are that Sushi was fresh and the chaqanmishi favours with real crab meat was exceptional.

Overall food and dining is great and will visit in the near future.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113278228004850197170/reviews
Cherrell Ng,4,"Our family ordered different items but I really enjoyed my Pork Katsu Soba - found it to be crisp without not too much batter and the noodles were so chewy! Shoutout to their miso soup that was light, refreshing and included other ingredients such as konnyaku. Dumplings paled in comparison to the Salmon Skin which I would order again!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114937435980675451596/reviews
Jacqueline Pinto,5,"‚Ä¶ had dinner here for the first time. I enjoyed my meal. The seafood was fresh and service was good. I always go for hara hachibo when eating, but I was full with the bento üç± ( just FYI I‚Äôm a small eater to give you context) I love eating Japanese and this place did not disappoint.

The price I guess is quite expensive but the quality of food justifies it IMHO. And yes, I‚Äôll definitely be back when I‚Äôm in town.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116987693980760480952/reviews
Whiskey Tea,3,"Tried the ikura , Uni , hotate , and negitoro don on a bed of rice flavoured with red vinegar .
Uni , scallop was fresh, the don was $78 , steep pricing if you ask me.

We got the the pork nabe, sashimi set up which comes with chawanmushi. The chawanmushi was very smooth.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111788781388191786320/reviews
