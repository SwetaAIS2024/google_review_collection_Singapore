They built confidence for children who will be embarking on their primary school journey and it was very assuring to see my own child settling in very well in the new environment. My children loved and still love going to mfs at wwp, they come home singing and dancing to new songs and will share good experiences. Partnership with parents has been good and engaging, during covid period they will call to check on how the child is at home and provided home learning for them which parents can bond with child.",

Overall very satisfied with the school system.\nHealth checks coordinated well and queues organized, staff are always friendly.\nTimely updates and reminders for school closures, events and health notices.\n\nI have to commend the teachers for their attentiveness to our kids wellbeing. When my second one had myopia, his teacher was the first to alert the signs of his eye problem to us. The teachers will highlight any problems in their learning or behaviour during Parent's Teacher meeting. Feedbacks like these are especially important to help us parents to identify the help we can give to our kids. But daily updates like photos in their Parent's portal also acts to assure us that they are learning and playing well too.\n\nThe teachers' effort to engage the kids with activities in Zoom meeting and YouTube videos over this pandemic period is also admirable because it surely wasn't an easy task.\n\nSo a big THANK YOU to them!",
