      "text": "Very responsible teachers and principal who are very passionate in what they are doing, especially for Ms Judy. My girl is weak in her Chinese, Ms Judy encouraged us to not pick her up early so she can have time to practise more as well as to do more with her at home. A humble and no frills place with a simple purpose of learning. I felt that my child is able to experience the kind of childhood we experience when we were young in this environment, simple playing after learning, no complications. The fees are also not exorbitant with option to upgrade to tuition at a nominal fee.",

They make sure there are no students left behind and I appreciate the extra mile from Principal, Ms Judy to guide my girl for Chinese lesson since we are not speaking mandarin at home but she so far always get a 95-100 mark for the spelling.\n\nLocation wise, is very convenient since we live near Hillview area. The pick up process from the school also smooth, with teacher supervision.\n\nThey are partner with Broadminded Tuition at the same premise, so i don’t need to enroll for extra tuition outside which is logistically is convenient for parents and also practical and value for money.\n\nThank you Teacher Judy, Teacher Nisa, Teacher Fatima and Teacher Zoe!",

A committed  Principal and a great team of Teachers, that are both caring and dedicated to the students' welfare and study progresses. Our child has been there for almost 3 years now and we can see the progress he's made so far.\n\nPaying attention one child's strengths and weaknesses is easy, paying attention to that of each and every child; takes more than just heart. Ms Judy has demonstrated what very few educators have, a dedication and care for the children, and most importantly; taking the effort to understand how each child learns and applies the best method of teaching.\n\nThis way, the child, the parents and the teachers can move in tandem; for the true benefit of the child.",

She took the initiative to group the kids into smaller group in order to have special attention to the weaker ones which has proven the effectiveness of their teachings.\nAlthough academic results is important but it is equally weighed for our kids emotional well-being which she manage to balanced.\nGreat stuff to teacher Judy, teacher Vivian, teacher Nisa & teacher Fatima!!",
