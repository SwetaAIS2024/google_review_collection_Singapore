Ashley Liew,5,Beautiful Catholic Church around Bukit Timah. It offers a quiet place of contemplation and reflection. The car park lots are spacious too which is helpful. The Church facilities are all clean and modern. Appreciate that there are lifts at each level which makes it accessible for many people. They also have a columbarium at basement 1. God bless everyone. üôèüèª,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Benia Densing,5,"The Church of St Ignatius is place of worship, prayers, reflections and singing which is neat to MRT station, residents and hawker. The main church hall has a very peaceful feeling. It has been a feeling of bliss that welcomes me each time I visit this place. The church has a lift near the main entrance. There is a small store but it has a wide variety of affordable reading materials. The church is meaningfully and richly decorated during Christmas season that will remind church - goers the true meaning of Advent season and Christmas day. Although the church is located near to posh houses of the ""rich"", the church is known to be very friendly and welcoming to migrants, domestic helpers and elderly.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116625948938615510327/reviews
