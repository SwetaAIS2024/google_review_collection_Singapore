Asmara Wati,3,"I had a late check-in on March 31, 2025. It took a bit of extra time to locate the property, as the hotel's name differed from what was listed on Tiket.com and the signage was not very clear. Clearer identification would be helpful, especially for first-time guests.

The room and bathroom were clean and generally comfortable. However, throughout the stay, housekeeping service was minimal. Towels were replaced, but the room was not cleaned, and the bed was left unmade, which was a little disappointing.

The reception staffâ€™s demeanor felt rather reserved, and a more welcoming attitude would have improved the overall experience.

On a positive note, the hotel is located in a quiet area, which is suitable for rest and relaxation. It may also be a convenient choice for Muslim travelers due to the surrounding amenities. However, for tourists new to Singapore, the location might be slightly less ideal as it is a bit removed from the city center and major attractions.

While there are some strengths, particularly in cleanliness and peacefulness, there is room for improvement in terms of service and guest communication.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104277146006272150228/reviews
Les Benet,4,Classic 2-3 star hotel. Location is convenient. Not the most well appointed but you get what you pay for. They give you late checkout if you leave a review.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104695207518621817357/reviews

Viv Hans,5,Had a decent stay. Got an upgrade when checked in. Room was spacious for double single beds. Plenty of space for luggages. Basic amenities given. Location was convenient for F&B. Bus stops were nearby to travel around. Only that the room walls were thin.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116767030341732611022/reviews
Gita Swasti,2,"Having traveled extensively and experienced various budget accommodations, I must say this hotel falls significantly below expectations.

Room Comfort & Facilities:
- The air conditioning system is severely limited, offering only basic on/off functionality without temperature control
- Heater maintenance issues require immediate attention
- Room amenities are basic and below standard for its rating

Location & Dining:
+ Excellent location for Muslim travelers with numerous halal dining options nearby
+ Conveniently situated close to shopping malls
+ Easy access to local mosque for prayers

Value for Money:
- Despite the competitive pricing, the overall experience does not justify even a basic hotel rating
- Significant improvements needed in room facilities and comfort to meet three-star standards",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117384565606202981370/reviews
