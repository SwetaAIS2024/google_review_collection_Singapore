I hope it never leaves.\n\nI have to agree with some reviews regarding the service level that has a lot of room for improvement. Other than that, the traditional kuehs are flavours and textures of childhood, which I will certainly return to occasionally.",

Everything else was bad. Kueh kosui was dry, alkaline lye taste. Salat was so hard and had tasteless rice. Donâ€™t bother with their chendol which was so gross.  Like everyone else saying, the chinese staff didnâ€™t like to serve her customers and had an impatient attitude.",
