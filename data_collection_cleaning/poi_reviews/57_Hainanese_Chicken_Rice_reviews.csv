Me T,3,"Pretty average chicken rice
Chilli is spicy but totally not a chicken rice chilli
Rice was decent
Chicken was decent, a bit on dry side
Soup has the chicken flavour
Overall passable.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108574826620835359575/reviews
Li Yen -,3,"I agreed that their rice was undercooked and lacked of chicken rice oil fragrance. But their chilli tasted good, and the chicken breast meat was tender. They gave me all breast meat and charged me $4.00. It came with a small bowl of soup which I agreed it was salty. It did not taste like normal chicken soup but I think it may be suitable for wanton noodles soup.

I see many people complaining here but there are many people queueing daily. It is not the cheapest chicken rice in Tampines though.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107209361835014317044/reviews
theakchee leow,1,"Ordered white chicken rice, and told them I do not want breast meat. Told its $5.50 if they give me chicken tail. $1.50 more expensive than standard order. Drum stick used to be $5.5, now $6. Stall raising prices only after opening not too long ago. Too pricey! Can get cheaper and also delicious chap cai peng at next stall beside it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102574298511114323834/reviews
Steven Lai,1,Encountered twice my takeaways char siew rice with eggs ( but never include them despite me paying the eggs). Not trustworthy stall. Will not want to patronize this stall anymore.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117853452004741533102/reviews
Ivan,3,Soup is too dead salty. White Chicken was good. Char siew don't seem to be roasted. Rice is slightly under cooked. Need a drink after this meal.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117364931581825188071/reviews
