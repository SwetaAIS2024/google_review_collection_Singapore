We did not ask them to take it back or refund... When asked for an exchange for the wrong lentils and the lentils that had insects, the lady gets aggressive and is extremely short tempered. I've sent pictures if the items in less than 5 mins (of the insects and wrong items) of the delivery. They refused to come back and take it.",
