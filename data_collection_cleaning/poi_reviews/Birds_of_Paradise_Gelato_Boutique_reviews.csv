m,5,I had strawberry basil. I didn’t know strawberries and basil go well together. The cone is good not like cheap ordinary cones. Other flavours look interesting too. It's expensive but their ice creams are made from all natural ingredients so it worth the price. It would be perfect if they accepted cash and had seats in the shop.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105550892012784714702/reviews
Tze Neng Chua,5,"Birds of Paradise are known for many of their unique flavours, such as Pandan, Earlgrey, White Chrysanthemum, Lemongrass, and the Peach & Rose Sorbet. Sounds sinful? Don't worry - the ice cream is supposed to be more natural and healthier compared to other ice cream!

The ice cream are priced at S$4.70 for a single scoop, and S$7.70 for a double scoop. You can add S$1 extra for their thyme cones, which are freshly made on-site.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104219894705865638823/reviews
Eugene Phua,5,Very nice ice cream. The gourmet flavours are very unique and definitely worth trying. Don’t just try “normal” flavours. Go out of your comfort zone! I just wish the store had seats in the store,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102830042561585484413/reviews
Cayla Tan,5,"I love their chocolate sorbet! — recommend it for people who like relatively dark chocolate that isn’t too adulterated / mixed with milk. The ice cream is a bit too sweet after awhile and could be a bit richer / darker, but if eaten with another flavour (like mango sorbet) to offset, it’ll be great

Love their ice creams generally and really nice waffle cones",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113251348641070023350/reviews
Liz Tan,5,"Did not regret trying this after being attracted by the smell of baking cones drifting from the shop. Tried their pistachio, so nutty and full of flavour. Their earl grey tea infused cone was to die for!! 10/10 recommended.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109026672952329865261/reviews
