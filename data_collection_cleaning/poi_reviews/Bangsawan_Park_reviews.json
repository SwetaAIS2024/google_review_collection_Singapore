Gets sunny in the mornings and evenings but it is shaded so still quite pleasant. Most of the sun goes by 6pm. Close to eateries like Baker and Cook, Plank and Saffron Catering for dining options (within walking distance)",

It's right behind baker and cook and other cafes right around the corner, but a secret little gem that brunch parents haven't seen to find out about!",
