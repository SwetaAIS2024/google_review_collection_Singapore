      "text": "This is one of the better Mee Pok Dried stall I had tried lately. It was very much the old time taste Âè§Êó©Âë≥ style. The noodle was good as it was cooked just nice and not soft to stick together.  There was fish cake, fish balls, a big prawn, ngoh hiang and surprisingly 2 pork skin and minced pork. The soup came with one each of fish ball, fuzhou fish ball, stuffed tau pok and fish wanton. This was considered large portion and great taste. Worth trying!",

      "text": "This Teochew fishball noodles stall definitely is one of the best in SG. Had the traditional mee pok dry. To my surprise, 8 different types of ingredients for just affordable $4 ONLY!! Uncle Sim also serves his goodies very fast and generous too.\n\nMee pok doesn't look the usual one but is slimmer type and texture of the mee pok is cooked perfectly well. Sauce and one special ingredient goes really well with mee, must stir it well so every string of mee pok is covered with flavourful sauce. Shiock arr!!\n\nAnd what's more, homemade ngoh hiang is delicious and uncle‚Äôs special sweet mince meat! YES, that's the special ingredient that make mee pok even more tasty. üòã\n\nWe will be back!!\n\nüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã",

      "text": "Was around the area and decided to drop by for lunch at Sim Vista Hawker centre. There weren't many stalls that were operating but managed to notice this stall that was selling fishball noodle. Price for the noodle starts from SGD$4 onwards.\n\nThe noodle was nicely cooked, texture of the  noodle was springy. I quite like the sauce as well because it compliments the noodle well. My bowl or noodle came with array of ingredients such as sliced fishcake, fishball, fried nor hiang, fish paste dumpling and taupok.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the noodle. It was definitely tasty and value for money. Highly recommended if you are Sim Vista food centre.",

      "text": "The first time I ordered noodles from them, I specifically asked for only ketchup, with no chili and no vinegar. However, when I got home and ate it, there was chili and no ketchup. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went back today to order again. I informed them that my previous order was wrong and repeatedly told them that I only wanted ketchup, with no chili and no vinegar in this order. Unfortunately, the order came with only chili again. I can't decide if this is intentional or if they simply aren't listening. I won't be patronizing this place again, and I don't recommend it.",
