Jesse Wong Adams,3,"For a housing estate supermarket, it’s stocked with some good imported cheese and good butcher section. Can’t say the same for the vegetable produce section - some of the vegetables have started to rot and still they are being sold, which is fine but shouldn’t it be at a discounted pricing? Like maybe they can put some of these vegetables at a section that shoppers don't mind buying at a really low price? So the produce don’t go to waste and the pricing is fair for customers. Also no stock on bay leaves in the dry herb section - disappointing. Need to mention to the staff - they are really helpful and courteous 💟",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116254646014919358761/reviews

Noorizah Mohd Noordin,1,"This is so disgusting & unethical of the Fairprice Finest outlet management in Waterway Point.
Frozen pork products are place in the freezer labelled for halal certified Fairprice household frozen product.

This shows that the management has no respect for the Muslim consumer & customers who patronise the outlet.

Even if the situation is due to shortage of freezer to place the pork product. The management should sought alternative solution from HQ before the Lunar New Year promo marketing sets in.

This is an unacceptable way of management. Please respect your muslim consumers as our trust are apart of your successful sales & marketing.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100061200855907626927/reviews
Tony Ng,5,"The leading supermarket chain in Singapore and their premium supermarket brand.

At this outlet, you can find a more premium range of products which is not commonly found in other normal Fairprice outlets. They have a good range of fresh produces including Organic and Japanese products. Pricing is cheaper compare to another premium supermarket chain.

The place is always crowded. Suggest to come during the opening time. As all the items especially the fresh produce had just stock up.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117002130592778694887/reviews
