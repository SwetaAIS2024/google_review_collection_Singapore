      "text": "Bought the curry chicken with blue pea rice.\nOne whole chicken thigh which was tender and flavourful. Good coconut taste and curry sauce is robust but not overly spicy. The texture of the blue pea rice is just right and the flavour of the rice is nice. It is kind of like nasi lemak.\nWill try the other chicken rice the next time.",

I have ordered Fragrant Steam Glutinous Rice 咸味糯米饭 which I found quite nice with plenty of ingredients, while the 香香饭菜 (Fan Choy) is just average because of the rice does not absorb the flavor of the meats and eggs. The white bee hoon is quite bland andee siam is not bad but the chilli is really spicy. I will definitely come back up try their other Nonya dishes.",
