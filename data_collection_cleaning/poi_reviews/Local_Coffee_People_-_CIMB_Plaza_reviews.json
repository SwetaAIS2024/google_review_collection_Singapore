Really enjoyed the chew Lemongrass chicken roll and the thick beef slices.\n\nBaguette was large and came with carrots, lettuce, some sweet sauce and the beef slices. I especially liked the crunchy bread, which went well with the sweet sauce and fillings. The beef was nicely seasoned too.\n\nThe Lemongrass chicken roll had a chewy exterior with a delicious interior.\n\nThe Lemongrass drink was slightly sweet, but not too sweet.",
