Daniel Tan Jia Wei,5,"I recently attended a skating trial class, and it was an incredible experience from start to finish! The facility was well-maintained, the session was well-organized, and the atmosphere was welcoming for beginners like me.

A special shoutout to Instructor Ella, who made the class truly exceptional. She was patient, encouraging, and explained every step with clarity. Her enthusiasm and passion for skating were contagious, and she ensured that everyone in the class felt comfortable and confident, regardless of their skill level. Ella's personalized tips and encouragement made it easy to grasp the basics, and by the end of the session, I felt a significant boost in my skills and confidence.

If you're thinking about trying out skating, I can't recommend this trial class enough, especially with Ella as your instructor. She truly makes the learning process enjoyable and inspiring! Looking forward to signing up for more classes soon.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105755465070030257719/reviews

Farhanah Shah,1,We signed up for a trial class but the instructor did not turn up and there was no response when we called and messaged to find out what was going on. Would not recommend this place to anyone.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106574729925099644023/reviews
