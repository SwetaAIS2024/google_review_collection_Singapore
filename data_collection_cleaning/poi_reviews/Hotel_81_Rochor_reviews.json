      "text": "Hotel is very well located on main road; within 100-150 mtr from Rochor MRT & bus stop. 7/11 shop below it is very convenient.\nAllowed early check-in at 12 noon.\nExternal facade looks nice with green window-panes but that causes zero visibility from inside rooms giving a claustrophobic feeling. Owner should think of putting clear window-panes to make rooms more attractive & bright. 3 bedded room has a mini cabinet, very inadequate for 3 persons. Balcony access is sealed with opaque glass. Bathroom is spacious with bathtub, no health faucet at toilet. No digital locker.\nRoom service staff should be trained to keep adequate nos of tea/coffee pouches according to number of occupants and not to remove any material lying on the floor other than from the dustbin, as the rooms are having hardly any platform/ table/ storage space to keep belongings and visitors can not be expected to keep every belongings inside bags during their hectic travel plan.\nApart from such small issues our stay was comfortable & convenient.\nThanks,",

The place is surrounded by decent places to eat. The room is acceptable for the price and there isn't anything outstanding worth mentioning while the cleanliness is decent. The staffs were quick and friendly. Overall a very good place for a cheap stay assuming you spend most of the time traveling around.",

Not only was there no hot water for our morning shower, the air-conditioner cannot be controlled from your room. This can only be adjusted by contacting the front desk, but it reverts back to original setting each time you leave your room.",

Suited us fine, great price and Iâ€™d stay here again for a night or two, but would prob pay a bit more to stay somewhere else if it was longer than a couple of nights.",
