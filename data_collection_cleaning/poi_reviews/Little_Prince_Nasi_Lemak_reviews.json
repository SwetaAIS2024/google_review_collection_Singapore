      "text": "We visited the Ang Mo Kio branch of The Little Prince Nasi Lemak after watching the Instagram reviews. We ordered two plates of nasi lemakâ€”one sambal petai prawns set and one chicken drumstick set. While our order was being prepared, we requested to add brinjal and two portions of otak to the chicken drumstick set. The staff member responded rudely, insisting that we should have specified our requests from the start. He said that he was hesitant to add otak unless we confirmed it upfront, fearing that we might not want it later. Despite my clarification that we were happy to pay for the add-ons, he remained unhelpful and curt, implying that our request was an inconvenience.\n\nThis poor customer service has left a lasting negative impression. I will definitely not be returning.",
