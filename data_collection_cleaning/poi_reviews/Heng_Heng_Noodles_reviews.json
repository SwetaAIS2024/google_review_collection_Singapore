      "text": "I ordered the minced pork noodles (bak chor mee) ‚Äúplain‚Äù version (i.e. neither having any chilli nor tomato ketchup) and it tasted quite good. I liked how they mixed the oil (most likely lard), soy sauce, white pepper, and other condiments. The taste was quite balanced when I compared with other stalls I had the ‚Äúplain‚Äùbak chor mee before. The only thing that wasn‚Äôt really to my taste was the type of noodles that they used. I think it‚Äôs a bit sticky. It could be due to overcooked accidentally. For a simple dish at a neighbourhood hawker centre and the price is less than $5, I won‚Äôt ask for more üòÑ",
