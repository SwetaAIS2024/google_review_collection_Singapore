The Travel Hunter,5,"The Gong Bao Frog Porridge has the perfect balance of flavors, with tender frog meat infused with a rich, savory sauce that pairs beautifully with the warm, silky porridge. The BBQ squid is one of the best I have ever tasted—grilled to perfection with a smoky char and a delightful chewiness. The sambal stingray is equally impressive, with its fresh, flaky texture and a spicy, aromatic sambal sauce that enhances every bite. Each dish is packed with bold, authentic flavors that make for an unforgettable dining experience. I highly recommend trying them for a truly satisfying meal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112702441126152817912/reviews
TTT,3,"Comfort food. Enjoyed the Cantonese congee and the rich, thick sauce on the frog legs. Requested extra spice, but it didn’t taste much different from the regular version. Wish it had more heat. The stingray was grilled well, and the chili had a nice kick.

Service was decent.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117174446031825028588/reviews
Zhilong Li,1,"Outright scam. Do not come.
Ordered a 3 frog with porridge.
Served with 3 frog thighs and some body parts. Thus I ask if served wrongly.
As usual, just kept saying it’s 6 thighs confirm. Maybe frog smaller etc.
I invited them to come my table and count but they don’t dare. Risk is considerable at this stall.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113257188981798612793/reviews
Paul Quek,1,"I am a regular to this stall. Today's kung pao frog was a shocker! It lacks in taste and the sauce was very diluted. I asked the stall if the cook was new because it was so blend but the stall keeper went on a defensive saying everyone is the same and implied the dish is the same. My family agreed that the stall owner should at least address my complain instead of defending themselves.   Honestly, to lose a long time customer, the blend taste holds only 10% of our decision not to come back, the rest of the 90% is because of their attitude.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103161591895149329742/reviews

First time here.
Ordered a simple frog porridge priced at $10.
Good enough for 1 pax. Taste is not bad.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116788322544213433170/reviews
