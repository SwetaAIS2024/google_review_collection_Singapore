      "text": "Was attracted by the word \"Amoy St\" when I passed by a coffeeshop in Jurong East (Blk 252). After a quick Google check, I realise this stall opened only recently in mid-August! And personally I've never tried the actual Amoy St Lor Mee before so I went ahead to try this one at JE.\nI ordered the $5 Jumbo Lor Mee, it came with a half egg, 2 tiny pieces of fried batang fish meat, some black colour Char Siew, and some unknown fried stuffs. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The gravy was really good, very flavourful, very thick and doesn't turn diluted after mixing the noodles around. Yellow noodles was well-cooked and chewy. The fried batang fish was not bad but there's only 2 tiny pieces of it. üòí The Char Siew was strange, so stiff and so dark in colour, why? üòë The rest of the sliced fried stuffs are the worst. It feels so hard and look like deep fried many times until I can't even tell or taste what they are!? Are they fried ngoh hiang? Or fried fish nuggets? Or fried tau kee? Nobody knows except themselves.\n\nDon't waste your $4 or $5 on them. There's so many Lor Mee without the word \"Amoy\" and they are so much better than this.",

Confirmed from them that this is the branch of the main store in Whampoa.\n\nHowever the food was nowhere close to the one at Whampoa. Honestly, it would be reasonable just one would expect better if it was Amoy St lor mee.",

      "text": "Didn‚Äôt try the original Amoy street lor mee so I can‚Äôt compare the taste. But this stall is really quiet without queue. Got the $5 jumbo version and I thought it tasted pretty normal. It came with a few fish pieces which was abit dry, some dark black char Siew which was hard, and some fried stuffs like ngoh hiang and fish nuggets I suppose which I enjoyed. Mine didn‚Äôt come with egg even though the photo showed but I thought mine had quite a bit of liaos in terms of portion. Probably just a normal lor mee, but nothing to hype about it I feel.",
