J C,5,"Dr. Yeo is an exceptional pediatrician who has made a significant positive impact on our family. From the very first visit, it was clear that he genuinely cares about the well-being of children. Dr. Yeo is not only highly knowledgeable and professional but also warm, patient, and approachable, which makes both parents and children feel at ease.

What stands out most is his ability to explain medical information in a way that’s easy to understand, without ever making us feel rushed. He takes the time to listen to our concerns and answers all our questions with patience and empathy. Our child always feels comfortable during appointments, thanks to his friendly and reassuring demeanor.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116378783802395817469/reviews

Letty Lian,2,"This review concerns the communication and administrative professionalism at Dr. Yeo’s clinic.

On 24/04/25 at 10.30am, I arrived for my child’s scheduled appointment only to be informed at the clinic that Dr. Yeo was unavailable due to illness.

When I inquired why I had not been notified in advance, a nurse stated that an attempt to contact me via phone was made, but there was no answer. I confirmed that I had not received any calls from the clinic. The nurse then suggested the possibility of a wrong number being dialed and mentioned that Dr. Yeo had been unwell since the previous day.

It is worth noting that I did receive a text message confirmation of the appointment prior to this incident. Given this successful prior communication, a text message informing me of the cancellation would have been a reasonable and efficient means of contact, especially with 24 hours' notice of the doctor's absence. However, no such notification was received.

To further verify the clinic's claim of a phone call, I checked my call logs, which showed no missed calls from the clinic's number. Subsequently, I sent a text message to the clinic requesting the date and time of their alleged call. The clinic responded with a text stating, 'Hi mum, sincerely apologize, we have checked on our end we did not inform you ahead that Dr Yeo is unavailable today.' This confirms that no prior notification of the cancellation was sent!

While a new appointment was offered, the details provided for the rescheduled date and day were inaccurate.

In conclusion, while I acknowledge Dr. Yeo's skill and compassionate approach, my experience highlights significant areas for improvement in the clinic’s administrative processes and communication protocols.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108873241078466828915/reviews

Janice Chin,5,"We are incredibly grateful to Doctor Yeo and his team for their exceptional care and support in managing our son's unprovoked seizure. After the episode, our son began showing signs of abnormalities, which I promptly shared with the team via chat. They quickly escalated the matter to Doctor Yeo, who recognized the urgency and brought him in for immediate checks. Doctor Yeo conducted a thorough examination, ensuring there were no major concerns. His meticulous approach and reassuring demeanor gave us immense peace of mind. The follow-up care has been equally outstanding, and we truly appreciate the continued attention to our son's wellbeing.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100361631063697139381/reviews
