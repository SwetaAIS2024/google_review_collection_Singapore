CK C,5,"Very friendly seller. Power Avocado was freshly made and delicious, but could do with some gula melaka. There were some gigantic coconuts, selling at only $3.50 each.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Saifu Angto,4,"Love the soursop snow from this stall.  Can really taste the soursop pulp in the drink.  It's sweet but mostly from the fruit instead of the added sugar.  It's great cold drink for a hot day and after a walk at Botanic Garden.

They also have a variety of avocado drinks that i didn't try.  Maybe next time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews

Paul Young,5,"Was wondering what soupsop snow was. Owner was friendly and said it was ice blended. He recommended avocado but not really something I take. In the end, took sour sop and enjoyed it. Only 1 issue, straw is too thin and ice keep getting stuck inside. Other than that, taste great.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109729405213634414664/reviews
