Chian Song Lim,5,Played badminton there a few times. It has more than 10 courts to book. The courts are not super stuffy. Although courts near the doors might be an issue as you might need to keep closing them properly when people come in and leave the door open,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117597573277381456027/reviews
Chris Lee,5,"It's really great to have a stadium close to where you live and use it for exercise. For seniors, this is perfect. Get a morning jog/walk in with many other seniors doing various exercises. And after cooling down, walk to the nearest hawker center for your favorite breakfast.
For national day celebrations, this stadium is also used for fireworks.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116440299972982099255/reviews
