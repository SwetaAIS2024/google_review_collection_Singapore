Brian Ong,4,"Bus stop number: 55169
This bus stop currently serves Bus 269. This is just right outside of 628 Market with sheltered walkway and an accessibility ramp.
The downside is that when it rains heavily, there is a slight leak between the bus stop and the sheltered walk ways on both side (To market and to traffic light crossing)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112053722108803512489/reviews
