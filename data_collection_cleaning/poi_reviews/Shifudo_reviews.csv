Cindy Chua,4,"Cosy place with great Japan food. Sashimi is fresh and thick. We ordered their softshell crab hand roll, soba, tempura & chawamushi. All taste good. Will be back again to try other dishes. Their outdoor seats are pet friendly but limited tables.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115728233345606689921/reviews
Mun Ch Wong,5,"Nice and cosy place, well decorated to give jap vibes. Thought music selection could be better to create an overall experience. Food was great, ingredients were fresh and the dishes we ordered were delicious. Some food items could be a tad pricier than other places but overall, it is recommended for you to try if you have not visited before.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103770661654078672803/reviews
Tan Phy,5,"Back again after the CNY , wow now with new Buffet spread - check out the Menu photos posted - Worth must order

Tempura, Yakimomo Grilled, House Special Roll and fresh made Handrolls are my top choices when dining - Great & Cosy ambience for indoor or outdoor dining both with friends or family  - Shifudo is definately the choice. If you are a udon or ramen noodle you must try their classic plain - refreshing yet not too overwhelming.

Not to also mentioned - Friendly amazing owner and her team of well trained staffs",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110766664347895265083/reviews
