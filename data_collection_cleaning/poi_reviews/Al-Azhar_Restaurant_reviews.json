Hardly touched these curries.  Ordered the Prata set with mutton masala but ran out & replaced with mutton keema I believe which was fairly good compared to the salty currys. The salted Lassi drink was nice.  I think some quality control need to be done for the curry's.",

While it’s popular for its Indian cuisine, especially the roti prata, the North Indian naan stands out—perfectly paired with their wide selection of flavorful gravies. The dining area is spacious, brightly lit, and impeccably clean, creating a comfortable environment to enjoy your meal. Prices are reasonable, and the convenience of ordering through a QR code and paying with credit cards adds to the overall experience.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone seeking a late-night prata fix!",
