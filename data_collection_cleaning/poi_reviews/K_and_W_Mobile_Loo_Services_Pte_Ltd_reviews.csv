Kia How,5,"I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to K&W Mobile Loo Service for their outstanding service and incredible patience. From the moment I inquired about renting a toilet for my niece's birthday party, their sales was attentive and professional. Even after gis working hours, he kindly addressed all my questions without hesitation.

The toilet provided was clean, well-maintained, and exceeded our expectations, ensuring our guests were comfortable throughout the event. Itâ€™s rare to find a company that goes above and beyond to prioritize customer satisfaction the way K&W Mobile Loo Service does.

I highly recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and high-quality mobile toilet rentals. Thank you for making our celebration seamless and stress-free!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117300810509854240432/reviews
