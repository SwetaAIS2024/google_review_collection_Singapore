Chee Kiong,5,"Enter Wcega Plaza, keep to leftmost lane and meet this non aircon eatery.
Friendly staff, good food and fast service.
Great chilli crab (very fresh), and the children love the crispy noodle, sweet and sour pork.
The only thing that we had that we all agree to skip is the deep fried fish and prawn paste chicken.
Overall a better dining experience than the other eatery at Wcega Tower.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102894000794903429883/reviews
Pam n' Rach,5,"I've visited Chuan Hai Seafood thrice in a fortnight! My family and I love the food here! Awesome taste even when food was dabao-ed. My wife loves the Black pepper crab, it was fresh, not overcooked and restaurant standard. I personally like their salted egg sotong; stir fried to perfection. Service was great and I was always greeted with smiles while the lady took my order. Thank you again Chuan Hai Seafood for the delicious meal! Best Zi Char in the West!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108536293903229638506/reviews
Kelvin Tan,5,Great seafood tze char. The boss was very nice to check up on us and offered a few times to get ice for our wine. We really enjoyed the pork trotter bee hoon and the steamed crab was on point and perfectly cooked. The lala soup also had a nice pepper hit. Prices were also reasonable. Will definitely revisit.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116273838821241344475/reviews
Bee Choo Cheng,4,The business is good here on a Saturday evening and lucky we have a table as we did not make a reservation. Service is good and the staff were friendly even though the team is busy. Food is fabulous and portion is good. The steam fish is good and fresh but the sauce is a bit salty. Prawn paste chicken is crispy and not too salty.  The tofu and deer meat is nice. The kailan is nice and we love the generous toppings of fried garlics. We wanted to cut the cake at the table and the staff were nice to provide us with paper plates and fork. We will be back to try more dishes.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107028407430947755113/reviews
Jerry Tang,4,"I've been here umpteen times but have not written a review for them until now. It serves one of the best tze char in the West, which explains my repeated visits.
