Nick McCluskey,5,"Massive shout out to Mun for awesome customer service. After the Sentosa app failing when we tried to book discounted tickets she happily applied these manually. Would also like to commend her for helping our son who was sick to make sure we were looked after.

The rest of the team at the booking desk were also awesome and friendly (Halim, Nova, Ayu, and Lindah).

Our family hope to come back to Singapore next year and will definitely be back on the zip line for another round ðŸ˜ƒ",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101296472568305171716/reviews

Oviya Moorthy,5,"Came during a weekday for the zip line and had no crowd.  Thereâ€™s a buggy that takes you up to the top and it was awesome!  All the staff we talked to was so kind, huge shout out to Lucy especially!  Would recommend bringing a clear bag to put your phone in to take a video or photo so you can take your own photo.  For early bird tickets book a day ahead!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118084626406139107808/reviews
