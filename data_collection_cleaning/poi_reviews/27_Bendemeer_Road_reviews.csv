Nina Chang,1,The noodle house had bad customer service where they blamed the customers for taking the wrong order and had to come to the table to tell us off. Sure they did exchange the noodle to the right order but I don’t think we deserve such bad service. The fried fish is also more of fried batter with tiny fish inside. The utensils from the other rice noodle stall was pretty dirty too. Overall horrible experience here.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105363833664555971363/reviews
Wanga,1,"This coffee shop’s mixed vegetable rice stall (Cai fan stall) is extortionist. They charged $5.80 for what you see in the picture.

Any vegetable dish with abit of minced meat mixed in, they will count it as a vegetable.
I had only ordered long beans, pork liver and fried tau gwa, they charged $5.80!

Be careful not to order those vegetable dish with any traces of meat mixed in, regardless of how little, they will charge you meat prices.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109266329478172341849/reviews
Ting,1,"Brought the 肉夹馍 from the mala store. Had to wait 10min $4. They use a small oven(?) so not crispy. Meat is anyhow done, for every bite there’s bone and fats chunk. I had to constantly puke it out. Value, waiting time, Qualify or taste all terrible.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113683209841359141103/reviews
Jonathan,1,"Bad times (recession) probably have drove people wild, food within this coffee shop is getting from bad to worse. Mala/Indian/mixed economic rice/fishball noodles, deserves a shoutout for being stalls to avoid at all cost.
Would be wiser to spend more at decent places, runned by people who still have their heads in place.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100470978440244717105/reviews
