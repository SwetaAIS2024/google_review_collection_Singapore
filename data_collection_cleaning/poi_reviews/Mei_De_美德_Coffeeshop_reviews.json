Let's hope the public will use it responsibly.\n\nThis coffee shop is huge with many stalls. Good selection and good food.\n\nThe contractor engaged to cleans the tables do a good job. Unlike other hawker centres where the cleaners simply sweep the leftover food stuff on to the floor and do not clean the tables.\n\nI hope the supervisor continue to motivate the staff to do well. Afterall, this is our country and we should be proud to keep everything and everywhere clean.",
