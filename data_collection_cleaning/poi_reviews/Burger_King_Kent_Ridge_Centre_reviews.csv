Rick Sim-Lim,1,"The aunty gave minimum amount as possible it seems. Ice cream so little same for fries. Not worth the money in my opinion plus service terribly slow, I came in mid-day weekday and so little staff and all slow-mo need wait more than ten minutes.
No utensils given at all I ownself take from their counter which was for dessert.
On and birds are regulars here too, eating crumbs every now and then. Aunties do yall think floor can sweep itself?",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117255426552047648966/reviews
Peach Mint,5,"Quiet place to enjoy food happily with your loved ones or alone.
Double mushroom swiss meal is our favourite as a family whenever we are at burger king.
Foods ordered by the self ordering machine kiosk, they prepared it fast. There were not much people when we came .
Was being served by Fara. She even provide us straws for my small kids to drink easily. Thanks to her.
Good initiative, good customer service.
Overall, everything was good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112428196440653463189/reviews
