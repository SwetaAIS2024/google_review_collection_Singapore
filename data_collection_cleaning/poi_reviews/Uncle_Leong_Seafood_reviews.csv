pr Teo,4,Nice food on our first visit! Restaurant was full after some time. Better make a reservation. Family members felt thirsty after the meal hence may not revisit.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103497961728941445272/reviews
Jimmy Liaw,5,"My go-to place for chilli crab cravings!

Never disappoints. Service is fast, and food quality is always consistent... even tho it's a reduced/modified CNY menu.

Thoroughly enjoyed every dish.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109624032060261463105/reviews
Florence Leow,5,"🍚🥢 Uncle Leong Seafood
*****************************
🟨 15, Lorong 8 Toa Payoh, #01-01 Braddell Tech,  Singapore 319262

❇️ My hubby had gone to Lorong 8 to dapao 打包 ( takeaway) Ngoh Hiang 五香卷+ Mee Goreng 印度面 for tonight's dinner from Uncle Leong Seafood restaurant.

🟧 We live just several bus stops away from this seafood eatery.● The restaurant is nestled on the ground floor of an industrial building at Lorong 8 Toa Payoh's industrial area.

The food tonight
*********************
🟩 The mee goreng is tasty, but what stands out most is the Ngoh Hiang ( Teochew 五香卷) or Hae Chor in Hokkien. 🌸The pan-fried beancurd-skin prawn-meat rolls are scrumptious.

🟦  The filling of the Ngoh Hiang is a generous composition of minced meat mixed with fish paste, chopped prawns, water chestnuts and bits of scallion. 🩵It is certainly one of the better quality Hae Chor/ Ngoh Hiang I've eaten so far.

❇️ Note =  The restaurant is not air-conditioned, and it is like your usual coffeeshop ambience type of seafood eatery. It has only ceiling fans to keep the place cool.

🥢 Service is generally friendly and efficient. 🟧 The prices are also very reasonable for a good seafood restaurant of this quality.

🟨 I have also included some throwback photos of the dishes we had eaten in the past during family dinner celebrations.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews

Hiang Ar,4,"Uncle Leong Seafood is a must-visit for crab lovers! Their chili crabs are outstanding—huge and meaty, with 1.2 kg costing under $100. The chili crab sauce is rich and flavorful, perfectly complementing the fresh crab. They also have different type of crab for you to choose. It's a fantastic value for such delicious seafood. The best worth its money zhicha stall.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101185220797498251612/reviews
