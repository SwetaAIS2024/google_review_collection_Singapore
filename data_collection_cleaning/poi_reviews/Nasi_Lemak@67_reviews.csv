Martin Tan,5,"Came for a weekday lunch. Nasi Lemak @67 is situated within the Ang Mo Kio 628 Market. There was already a lunch queue forming but it was fast moving. Kakak who took the order was friendly. The order menu is simplified as they are categorised alphabetically. Ordered set G, the nasi lemak with quarter chicken for $6, which is pretty affordable for what you're getting.

The 2nd Kakak was busy frying a new batch of chicken, so got the quarter chicken piping hot. Got the order within 5-7mins, Kakak did ask whether I was ok to wait for the fresh batch of chicken mentioned above.

The nasi lemak itself is probably one of the nicest tasting, way better than the overrated ones in Changi Village. The rice used is quality basmati rice, and flavour wise, it is just splendid. Fluffy, fragrant and lemak (rich from the coconut).

The quarter chicken was just as good, definitely fresh and not the frozen chicken variety. The outer batter was not overly thick, fried to a very crispy finish, leaving a very satisfying crunch. The chicken meat was tender and juicy, it did help I got a batch straight from the frying wok.

The nasi lemak chilli was also nice, tangy and sweet at the same time. The accompanying ikan bills (small anchovies) were not overly saltish and the peanuts had enough crunch and were not stale. Lastly, the fried sunny side up egg was not overcooked, soft and not rubbery. Overall a very satisfying lunch set, glad to have found Nasi Lemak@67, a hidden nasi lemak gem nestled in one of the older parts of Ang Mo Kio, on the fringes of Yio Chu Kang.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105915255136992981751/reviews
Khai (Khai's Diary),3,"It's actually quite good. I got the set G. The only problem I have is the chicken was kinda sad. The piece I got was mostly bones. Other than that, everything was good. Chicken was well marinated and the portion of rice was quite big. Sambal was nice too.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103386359256750778127/reviews
Wesley Xu,4,"The rice was the highlight here, flavourful yet not overwhelming. Wanted to order chicken breast but was sold out so settled for chicken wing which was decent. Chili sauce was pretty good as well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116507817542057576800/reviews
Dawn Lim,5,"Yummy nasi lemak. This stall uses basmati rice. The rice is flavourful. The fried chicken wings are good too. And so is the sambal.

We got a plate with two chicken wings, one egg, no peanuts, and a reasonable serving of sambal for $5.50. Considered reasonable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113563695447323499189/reviews
