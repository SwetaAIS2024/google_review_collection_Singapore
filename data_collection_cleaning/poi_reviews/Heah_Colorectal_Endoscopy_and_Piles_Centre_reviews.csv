Belinda,1,"The doctor at this clinic has been practicing for many years which has unfortunately led to a superior than thou, I know better than you attitude. However, his techniques are grossly backward and inadequate, leaving his patients with severe pain, trauma and scarring. To add insult to injury, he lacks empathy, along with his staff, as several others have mentioned. Will recommend this clinic only to my very worst enemies.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101787710542938524927/reviews
Anissa Wong,3,"I felt this practice focuses more on their business performance rather than caring for their patients.  Did they do what they were supposed to do procedurally? Yes. Would the problems the patients have be solved? May be. Would the patient feel she is being cared for? Not really.

Condescending would be how I would describe the tone of voice of the doctor. The nurses were more or less ok. The day surgery room was cramped. Very cramped.  When I looked at the photos hung on the walls in the clinic, I understood why. They take pride on their business success rather than their treatment success or patient care.  Every single framed wall hanging was news clipping about the clinic chain as a business. Nothing else. The vibe wasn’t right.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101898999547860963232/reviews
Farting Pixie,5,"Dr Heah is amazing with his years of experience in this field.
He gave me a very straight forward and firm answer.
He’s being very honest , no beating around the bush, which patient really will appreciate.
He took extra efforts to explain my condition.
Thanks so much dr heah.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114221561092807765732/reviews
Andreas Vesalius,2,"Very good availability.
However, bad experience for a simple hernia, ugly scar and relapse less than a year after the intervention. After the second hernia undertaken at NUH, I understood that the operation followed by Dr. Heah was not adequate. So I would not recommend, especially in relation with the cost.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105419902133298590585/reviews
Goh Kim Teck,1,"My experience with the clinic,is below average.I was not given proper instruction before my urea breath test. When talking to the doc , lack sense of empathy. Very transactional.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103126865740458935547/reviews
