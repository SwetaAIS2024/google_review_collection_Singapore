steven lim,3,"Ordered five items and there was a mixed reaction.  The fried fish and chicken teriyaki was a nice portion and the fish was nicely fried.

The oyaka don and the beef don also had a lot of rice but the amount if meat and egg could be improved.

The salmon and pork katsu bento was okay though the fish was smaller than expected.

Tastewise, most of the dishes were okay.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117434407303387249783/reviews

Bueh Tahan,3,"Local styled coffee shop with Halal section. Worst vendor is the veggie rice stall with their inconsistent quality. Beware their prices that vary from day to day; count you change before you walk away with your food!! I rate them ½ ☆ /10.
Best value for money would be the Ban Mian stall. Rating 8 ☆/10.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114925585122866292872/reviews
