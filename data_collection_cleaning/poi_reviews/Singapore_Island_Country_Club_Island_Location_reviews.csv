Melanie E,5,"We were invited here as guests for lunch. The venue is beautiful and the golf course is well kept. The review is for the restaurant.

Food: 5/5 - if I could rate the food here, it would be 5++. They had a special menu for Chinese New Yearâ€™s. Everything was delicious and well presented. My favorite was the roasted pig and fresh steamed fish.

Service: 4/5 - good service as they were attentive and replaced our dishes with clean ones.

Atmosphere: 5/5 - beautiful interior. We window views of the golf course.

Note: this place is exclusive to members only.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136896090209853190/reviews

Khun C,5,"Thankful to have been invited as a guest. A very warm, family atmosphere. Service was very welcoming. The grounds were extremely well kept. Food was delicious and a mix of western and local favorites. It felt as if you were no longer in Singapore. I didn't see any buildings at all from the rear balcony of the restaurant. Amazing.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113032638184818514755/reviews
Flo Yeow,4,"It's definitely a nice place, with a lot of greens and large spaces for a private gathering. Even the grand ballroom, along with the hosting area, was nice.

That said, it's a little hard to get to for someone without a car, and the parking is frankly speaking a little exorbitant. We had a wedding lunch held here and the carpark alone would have added up to be about 25sgd for a 3hours parking time. For a place that has this much space, as much as I recognize that they're trying to be a little more exclusive, is a little tough to reason.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
