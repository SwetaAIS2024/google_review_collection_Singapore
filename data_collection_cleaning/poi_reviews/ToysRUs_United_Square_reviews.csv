25Y2G CARSON LEE JIA SHENG,5,"Thereâ€™s a LOT of rare HotWheels every week I come here. The pictures here show my best hauls, featuring a Ford GT, McLaren F1, 911 Turbo, 2x Mustang GTDs and many more! Prices for the mainline HotWheels are below the average price of other stores, surprisingly. Very worth the price!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110572308754286297948/reviews
Bren A,2,"Update:
So.... the recipient of that gift card was told that the card ""did not exist"" when they went to use it. Thanks Toys R Us for causing embarrassment and disappointing little kids.

Not the best outlet. Even out of stock for wrapping paper... and it's not even Christmas. (this was two months ago in late sept)

Also, it's kind of weird that you need to fill up your information just to buy a gift card? ðŸ¤”",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116328377056822464274/reviews
Nirmal Balasooriya,2,"The store is badly managed, with no price tags on toys and no conveniently located price checkers. Itâ€™s understaffed, and they're out of free wrapping paper, unlike other branches.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106413501068372675984/reviews
Pammie Lee,1,Was at the novena sq outlet on the 20th Dec at around 2 to 3pm to get a present. While checking out I asked for gift wrapping which has been a free service from toys r us for as long as I remember. Was told off there wrapping paper was out of stocks rather impolitely. Are the staff not trained to have better communication skills ? Or is this the service level of toys r Us these days ? Xmas around the corner and no gift wrapping ? Standard dropped . Probably everyone shopping online elsewhere for better deals.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105002854970803437472/reviews
Josh,3,"Great toys, but the store is overflowing with boxes all over the place. They stock twice as many toys as the store can reasonably hold so boxes are strewn throughout the aisles; can be difficult to actually walk through. Their stockroom must be tiny because unopened shipments block the paths every single day and they do stocking during business hours (rather than before they open) so it's a giant mess. Nice to see TRU still in business though as someone from the US where it is no more.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118290806996418324875/reviews
