She helped me get a quick understanding of the menu and recommended to me her personal favourite - fried fish soup, which I really enjoyed! Fish fried to perfection and good amount of vegetables in the soup to add that natural sweetness. Ordered the toast set too that came with a good amount of Kaya and I liked the doneness of the eggs as well! It was nice that I can change my drink to yuanyang with no additional charge too! Will definitely come back again!",

      "text": "Honestly, this has one of the best fried fish in Singapore. Very rarely do fish soup sellers allow the seperation of the fried fish and the soup, but this is one of them.\n\nThe fried fish is able to retain its crispy outer batter, along with the natural juices of the fish that pops in your mouth when eaten. Amazing fried fish that can be eaten on its own.\n\nThe downside is their soup is not very flavourful. It is clean, probably because it is near the hospital and has dietary standards it adheres to, but the soup has a strong vegetable taste compared to a savoury seafood broth taste that good fish soups have. Overall, +1 and -1",
