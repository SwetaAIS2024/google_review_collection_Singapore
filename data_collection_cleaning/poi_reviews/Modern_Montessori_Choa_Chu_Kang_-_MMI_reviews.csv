Reqha Trixie,5,My son transferred in to MMI CCK from another school. The best decision that I have ever made. The teachers are so welcoming and nurturing. I feel at ease when my son is in school and Iam at work as I know that he is well taken care of. The teachers regularly update photos of activities that they conduct. Seeing my son engaged through those pictures make me feel very happy. Thank you MMI CCK!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107798998617663291899/reviews
