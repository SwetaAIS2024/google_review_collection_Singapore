mowen low,5,"I had braces for about a year and a half, and my experience with Meiplus was genuinely great. From the very first consultation, they made everything clear and explained the whole treatment plan in a way I could easily understand. The staff were always friendly and professional, and the appointments ran on time most of the time, which I really appreciated.

Throughout the process, they were gentle, answered all my questions, and made adjustments with care. The clinic was always clean, and I felt safe and comfortable at every visit. Now that my braces are off, I’m super happy with the results, it was totally worth it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110236461115412580474/reviews
Jimi Tan,5,"I want to express my gratitude to Meiplus Dental at Marine Parade for their outstanding service. In November 2024, I underwent three extractions and two implants, and Dr. James and his team were incredible. The procedure was painless, handled with great professionalism, and every detail was well taken care of. Even though my treatment extended 45 minutes beyond their working hours, their patience and commitment to my needs never wavered. Thank you, Meiplus staff, for going above and beyond. Kudos to your excellent work! - J. Tan",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103196599436141911846/reviews
Poh Tze Theng,5,"I recently visited Meiplus Dentalcare and had a really pleasant experience! Dr Emma performed my scaling and polishing, and fillings. Throughout the procedure, she would constantly check in on me to make sure i am not feeling any pain / sensitivity. She would also explain the process to me such as taking before and after photos of my fillings. I also did an xray for my wisdom tooth, process was very fast and smooth!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105636434559483392690/reviews
Kevin Tay,5,"Dr. James has been my trusted dentist since his days at Punggol and Ubi, and it's been amazing to see him grow and finally open his own clinic, Meiplus Dentalcare, in Marine Parade. He’s always been so professional yet warm, making every visit comfortable and stress-free. You can tell he genuinely cares about his patients, always taking the time to explain treatments and ensure you’re at ease. His new clinic is modern and welcoming, a perfect reflection of his dedication to providing the best care possible. If you’re looking for a reliable and caring dentist, I can’t recommend Dr. James enough!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104557261337467056843/reviews

The clinic is new, clean and currently there is promotion for xray and consultation.
Throughout the whole process, Dr. James and Cora are very reassuring knowing that I am very nervous.
Dr. James is gentle and will keep you informed during the process. The tooth extraction was fast.
Cora is also very helpful throughout the process.
Overall, it is an excellent service and would definitely recommend.
