Doctor Nie was extremely fast in locating where exactly is hurting, and her treatments were very effective in releasing tension and pain at the affected areas. Very transparent in their prices too as their receipt breaks down the fees that they charge very specifically. Thank you!",

The doctor was so nice and explained things slowly for me.\n\nShe used medicinal herbs during the acupuncture session and also incorporated some electrical pulses to some one area of my shoulder blade.During the session, the doctor will come in and check on you midway to make sure everything is fine too.\n\nHaven't tried out other services but the acupuncture is definitely highly recommended!",
