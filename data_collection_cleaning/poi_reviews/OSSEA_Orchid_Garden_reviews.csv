Hector Niam,5,A really cool small area dedicated for orchids. There are quite a number of exotic orchid species here. Kudos to the volunteers for taking care of this place. I always pop by to admire the plants when I'm at HortPark. Recommended for all orchid lovers!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108905835049375950798/reviews
