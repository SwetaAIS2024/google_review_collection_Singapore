Recently, the studio has improved its branding and safety measures by adding its logo to the swim caps, which is a great initiative.\n\nNow, my children, who are almost 6 and 8 years old, are at Stage 1 and Stage 3, respectively. A big thank you to Coach Cindi for her patience and for making the lessons fun and enjoyable! She is a responsible coach who, despite her busy schedule, takes the initiative to send reminders to parents.",

She practices active listening to ensure her learners learn and apply the correct method of swimming. Her reassuring approach builds confidence in swimmers and I'm glad I am a seasoned swimmer after a year of class with her when I started without much experience.",
