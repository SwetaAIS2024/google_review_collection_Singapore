Michelle Natashia (michtashia),5,"Came with a mixed group of first timers and experienced wakeboarders.

Melanie was really detailed in teaching us how to wakeboard. She also continued to give us pointers when we‚Äôve successfully got above water and when we‚Äôve washed out. Her feedback are direct and succinct, but she really means well and you can tell she wants you to enjoy the sport and have a great time. We really had a great time with Melanie and would definitely want to go back again. Thank you Melanie!

Showers are available onsite but they‚Äôre kind of worn down - best to just head home to shower.

Pro tip: Ice water is provided onboard but bring some snacks like gummies and cookies! Cos you‚Äôll need some sugar and sustenance after wakeboarding and also while waiting for your turn to get in the water - it‚Äôs good to munch on something so you‚Äôll not get seasick (although its unlikely you do as the waters in Punggol are so calm).",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104578823592521848931/reviews

Kevin Lim,1,"Prebooked a session on september 8th for october 4th slot at 4.30pm for 3 hours (which is today) good thing was no deposit was needed. However when it came to 4th october, Tom (82435139) gave pretty last minute notice that his boat was down. omfg! how outrageous and flaky! First and last experience.

If you're considering, I'd say to save your time give these guys a skip to avoid any trouble and disappointment.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115124566428445554028/reviews
