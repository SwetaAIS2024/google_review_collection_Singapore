Tim Ezra,4,"I had a great time exploring the Vintage Camera Museum—a small but captivating spot for anyone who loves photography history. The collection of vintage cameras is well-curated, offering a nostalgic peek into the past of this craft. It’s a cozy space that packs a lot of charm.

However, the ticket prices feel a tad high for the size of the museum. Reducing them could draw in more tourists, which would not only make it more accessible but also boost the sale of vintage cameras they offer. With a little pricing tweak, this place could really shine. Still, a solid 4-star experience for camera buffs!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107288961181819489105/reviews
Shaila Afrin Mousumi,5,"Visiting the Vintage Camera Museum in Singapore was like stepping back in time through the lens of photography. Located in a unique building shaped like a giant camera, the museum immediately grabs your attention even before you step inside. Once inside, I was amazed by the impressive collection of over 1,000 cameras, ranging from early box cameras to more modern film models, some of which date back more than a century. Each piece tells a story about how photography has evolved over the years, both in design and technology. I especially enjoyed the chance to see rare and quirky models, including spy cameras and miniature versions. The exhibits are well-organized and informative, making it a great experience whether you’re a camera enthusiast or just someone curious about the history of photography. The museum also allows you to handle some of the items, which adds a fun, interactive touch to the visit. Tucked away at 8C & 8D Jalan Kledek, it’s a hidden gem worth exploring if you're in Singapore. It’s a quiet, charming place that inspires a deep appreciation for the craft of capturing moments.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114233733168463579140/reviews

Nandini Kitroo,5,"A little room with an ocean of knowledge and information.

The building itself is so cute in the shape of a camera with the entrance from the lens.

Camera collection is massive and the little tour is informative and engaging.

If you are Into cameras , this place is totally worth a visit.  It’s easily located with next to a ‘bef sultan mque’ bus stop .

The only bit of inconvenience is that it’s usually locked with a phone number to call  mentioned at the entrance. So you need to have a working phone to call that number so that the owner comes and opens the museum for you to visit. The tickets can be a little expensive for some so it’s the best that you ask the ticket price when you make that phone call.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104800889578817619901/reviews
Issy Routledge,5,"Would give 10 stars if I could. This was so fun and such an impressive collection. Uncle was so funny and gave us a guided tour and we learned a lot. $20 is totally worth it, don’t listen to Ryan or Georgina",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109010228262295217402/reviews
