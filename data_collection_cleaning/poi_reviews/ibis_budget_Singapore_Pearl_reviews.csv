Petae86,4,"Good value for money. A bit suburban and the cheap rooms are not big, but you'll be in town all day anyway. The area is a red light district and there are quite a few migrant workers in the area, but that's not too distracting. The yellow metro is 15 minutes away, the green 10. It's quiet, fairly clean and well equipped.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111001584445847751341/reviews
Wanvisa K,5,"It’s a hotel with a great atmosphere, perfect for staying with a group of friends. It’s not far from the train station, with a bus stop right in front. The station is within walking distance, and there are plenty of restaurants around the hotel.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109997833539791190933/reviews
Adam Rainoff,4,"Don’t expect a five star hotel at the Ibis Budget Pearl. There are hundreds of expensive hotels in Singapore.

If you need a safe, quiet, clean place to stay, and you want to save money, this is it.

The location is in Geylang, where there are dozens of economical restaurant options, stores, and low prices for the budget traveler. Geylang is also the site for legal prostitution, but it’s not an issue. Keyword: legal.

If you’re intolerant to other cultures, customs, and people, stay away from Geylang. But if you’re like me, who wants to see, hear, and sense the real Singapore, this is the place to be.

There are bus stops at either end of the quiet street that get you to everything in Singapore within 15-30 minutes, and a subway station in a 10 minute walk.

Singapore is safe, and nothing happens to anyone here except fun and excitement discovering new things.

All of the staff at the Ibis was great and helpful, including the night crew, cleaning crew, and day shift Siti and Pang.

The rooms are simple but totally comfortable. Save your money for the sights and stay at the Ibis Budget!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111276751165526452254/reviews
Amethyst Jade Salape,4,"Indeed a budget hotel. Expect budget value.
Place was near many  authentic singaporean/indian/chinese restaurants, but don’t be fooled with the bustling Geylang. We did not know any better. This place is Singapore’s pleasure district, and is filled with men. Had an unpleasant experience along with two females who I was travelling with. We were followed along by a stranger and had to call for help.

Didn’t also felt safe at the hotel. Our room had roaches, and the bathroom had an open ceiling, and we can see through the vents and pipes and we didn’t feel safe. We had to makeshift our shower curtain to cover the ceiling.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111241932290678224838/reviews
