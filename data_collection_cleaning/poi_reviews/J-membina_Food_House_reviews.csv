S L,3,"The economy rice here is a little saltier than that at the economy rice stall at the neighboring kopitiam, Food Loft but is decent for the prices they charge. Price wise, both stalls sell the same 1 meat-1 vege-1 egg combo at $3.3. The tehsi-siudai ($1.6 for takeaway) here is alright. Paynow/paylah are available.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111316266362121177513/reviews

esther,1,"Racist brown colour hair auntie at the beverage store.

I ordered 1 cold barley and 1 teh peng to drink at the store and I ordered in Chinese, auntie keep replying me with English instead and give takeaway cup. I asked for glass since Iâ€™m having it here and auntie reply that she knows Iâ€™m having it here.
I asked why she didnâ€™t give me glass and she said since she pour to plastic cup alr might as well I need to pay.

So she marked up the price for me.

This is not the first time I came to this place and ordered from the stall yet she dare to do this to foreigners.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106215694873877686033/reviews
