Whiskey Tea,4,"Tried new salad , miso kiss which is seared tuna with wild rice , tomatoes , pickles , sweet potatoes üç† and leaves  with walnut miso dressing . The crew toss the salad coating the leaves .",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111788781388191786320/reviews
Bellpeppers Huiz,2,"My only gripe was that the brown rice was extremely hard and crunchy, which made the entire experience unpleasant. Every bite felt like a labourious workout. I reckon it's because I placed my order just before closing time, and the rice may have been sitting in the pot too long and got burnt. Thankfully, the other ingredients were quite tasty. What a shame--it could have been a great meal.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116039663285451456972/reviews
ethan lee,1,"got lunch here. salad was bland and distasteful. more importantly, one area of the salad tasted like soap. (possibly staff accidentally flicked soap into the bowl or when washing the vegetables etc). caused me to develop food poisoning. do not recommend visiting.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106973521059377005797/reviews
Desmond Tribdino,4,"The physical store itself is showing its age (some wobbly tables and chairs, the leather on the bench we sat at was peeling, one of the lights was flickering on and off). But the food is great, and the staff is very friendly and attentive. Their seasonal menu items are always delicious. My only real gripe is that I live too far away to visit more frequently ü§£",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103782500677699438777/reviews
Matthew Lee,4,"Used to eat this few years back and reminds me of the days where I couldn't grab a decent lunch and had to do quick takeaways at Salad Stop. They have closed down quite a lot of branches so it wasn't easy to come by, and took the opportunity to try again when I saw it at Novena Square.
Gone are the days when you still can pick free toppings. I actually asked for it and they told me there are no free toppings anymore, and gone were the days where I could spend less than $12 but now it costs more than $20!
Some of the items in the menu have also gone and replaced with new ones, so I decided to try Jeju Bap rather than the usual Jai Ho.
Pretty nice and friendly staff had a short chat with them. Food was of quite generous portion still was very filling after finishing the wrap. Taste of the pumpkin soup hasn't really changed over the years, but still preferred the days where we used ground black pepper instead of the powdered one.
Expensive but still pretty decent and a healthy option to choose.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109397825257995094119/reviews
