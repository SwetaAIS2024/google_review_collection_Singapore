William,5,"The 24/7 MAMA Shop at Faber Crest is an absolute gem for residents. I heard a story from one of the neighbors about how she was able to grab some emergency salt at the last minute, which highlights just how essential this shop is. Given that the nearest alternative stores are quite far, this place truly feels like a lifesaver at times.

While the prices are a bit on the higher side, that’s understandable for such a convenient setup. What makes this store stand out is its unique trust-based system. There are no cashiers—just several security cameras to ensure everything runs smoothly. The integrity expected from customers adds a refreshing touch. Plus, they accept all forms of payment, including cash, with a coin box available for making your own change.

The shop is well-stocked with essentials like milk, oil, and even snacks for kids, including a nice variety of candies. They also have fridges filled with cold drinks, which are perfect for a quick refreshment. One of my favorite sections is their large selection of instant noodles, offering plenty of options for a quick meal.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101379353848168923346/reviews
