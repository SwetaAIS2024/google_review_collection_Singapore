Jenevieve Ho (Jen),5,"Hi! I'm a secondary school student, and I've attended around a year's worth of tuition lessons here. My Chinese standard has undoubtedly increased after the lessons, especially with the help of the teachers! Personally, I choose to go for tuition lessons on top of the usual school lessons not because the school lessons are inadequate, but because I would prefer to have more practice in certain areas (eg. 短文填空/病句改正). The teachers here take note of every student's progress and they print out worksheets that give students much-needed practice. It's also clear that the teachers care a lot about the students, and their encouragement and support really help!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108260416109011532855/reviews

Wan Not Ton,5,"My son is very hyper(ADHD). I sent him to Berries for 2 trial lessons, the well known ctr rejected him as they said he can’t sit properly. I chance upon Xue Lin and sent him for 4 trial lessons, the Teachers and owners are all very sincere and I can really tell that they sincerely want to help my boy improve. Their class size are relatively small and I like that as teacher can better manage all the kids in class comparing to those big classroom setup. I am very thankful that they look beyond my boy’s issue(unable to sit properly) and focus on helping my boy improve his Chinese. Thumbs up XueLin!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115230900790984959591/reviews
