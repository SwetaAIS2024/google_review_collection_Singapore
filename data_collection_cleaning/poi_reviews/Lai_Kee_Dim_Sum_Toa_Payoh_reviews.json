The server dropped the law mai kai on the counter top near the cash register while serving a customer in front of me. It was put aside, when I ordered, that law mai kai was given to me. When we asked for a new one, the old aunty who is collecting payment lied saying itâ€™s a new one.. she over charged me by $1.10. Total should be $7 but was charged $8.10. Food is so so and  the honesty of the staff is questionable.",
