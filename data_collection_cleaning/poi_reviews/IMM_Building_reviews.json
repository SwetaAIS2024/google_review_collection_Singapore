      "text": "One of the best places to shop if you're looking for great deals. It's an outlet mall, so you can find discounts of up to 80% on big brands like Nike, Adidas, and Coach. The selection is pretty solid, from fashion to homeware, so there’s something for everyone.\n\nThe mall is spacious, and it’s easy to navigate with all the stores grouped by category. There are plenty of food options too, whether you're in the mood for local food or something more international, so you can grab a bite while shopping.\n\nIt’s a 5-minute walk from Jurong East MRT, so it’s super convenient to get to. Weekdays are best if you want to avoid the crowd, but even on weekends, it’s still pretty manageable.\n\nIf you're looking for a spot to shop and save, IMM is definitely worth checking out.",
