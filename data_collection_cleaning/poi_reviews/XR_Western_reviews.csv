KR Lee,5,"Had XR's mixed platter recently for $12. Chose chicken chop, fried dory fish, white cream (pasta).
Beeper was provided. Waiting time for me was within 10 minutes, food was served in fresh hot state, portion was quite generous. Besides bottled chili sauce, bottled mayonnaise was also provided.
White cream pasta is quite creamy with good garlic taste.
The kopitiam is quite clean and neat.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115538332501875770266/reviews

AJ Quek,5,"As a frequent customer I always trade up the fries for their white cream pasta simply because it's rich, flavourful and probably as good as what you can get in cafes out there.

The stall owners pay special attention to the freshness and portion of what they serve. Once they insisted on frying me an extra piece of battered fish because they felt the 2 pieces of fish given to me did not meet their expected size.

If you live nearby or come to Kebun Bahru for meals please give them a try!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106204540277965349088/reviews
Stanley,4,"The chicken cutlet was crispy and was a better choice than their fish and chips, as the latter was a little bit soggy. Portion was good and overall the food was worth the price you are paying.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109779294020772182875/reviews
Vivian Foo,4,"Love the chicken cutlet. It was crispy, juicy and flavourful. The salad was average and the fries were meh. May return to try the other dishes.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100911167835907085056/reviews
