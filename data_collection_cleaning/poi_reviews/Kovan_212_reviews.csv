WenKang “wenkang” Chin,4,"(Apologies for not taking down the stall’s name)
Accidentally discovered this stall, selling Malay/Indonesian dishes in a economical rice style.
Tried their ayam penyet, pretty good and authentic.
Chicken is a little dry but overall texture and taste are good. Chilli is not too bad, acceptable.

S N,1,"Coffeehouse food are fine. But NOT that grumpy middle aged woman who cleared and cleaned the table.  She is also taking drinks order, but refused to do so, by claiming that she is busy - when she sat there digging her nose?!!!  The Kopitiam boss ought to reprimand such a unhygienic female worker there!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111820610351072921771/reviews
