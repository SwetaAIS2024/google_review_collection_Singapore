hafizah abdul latif,4,"My children have been to this branch and I am very grateful for the lessons and care from the teachers, principals and all the staffs.
I would give a full 5 stars review, just that, i was quite disappointed when I asked to meet up with my child's teacher to know about her progress in school, as I co-parent. Apparently, the school didn't allow me to do so.
Which was weird, as even full-time Madrasahs would do that, if it is for the betterment of the child's well-being.
My constructive feedback: School has to listen to *both* sides of stories if they co-parent, especially if it is for the child's well-being.
Thank you, all in all, and may Allah bless your effort.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102930921835498150574/reviews
