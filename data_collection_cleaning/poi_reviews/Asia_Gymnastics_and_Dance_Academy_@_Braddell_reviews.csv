Janice Yap,5,"Happy to find this artistic gymnastic course for my child. The coach is patient and nice. The In charge is understanding and friendly. The gym comes with many equipments, environment is proper and clean. It‚Äôs not crowded so my child gets attention from her coach. It is a good course to build immune system and flexibility. Been to a few gyms but find this one of the best. üëç Thank you. üòä",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102534252003995789987/reviews
Calvin YEOW,1,"Non nurturing trainers despite having already feedback to the trainer. My kid has been enjoying gymnastic at another gym that has shifted. My kid has only been to two sessions but now refuse to attend further sessions, citing that trainers will tell her that they rather she leave the academy than teach her.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103615868444073021103/reviews

Manish Prashant,5,The  Gymnastic is having good infrastructure and coaches are very friendly. The suggestion is they should be more kids friendly in terms of allowing the parents to be with smaller kids occasionally to make them comfortable with the coaches.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101628091410471976262/reviews
