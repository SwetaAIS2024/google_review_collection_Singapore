Kris Mei,2,"Staff at the cashier is rude, attitude issue. Food standard has dropped. Rice is hard, unsure whether was leftover. Unhygienic!!!   Staffs handle vegetables and noodles with bare hands (no gloves) after handling money or adjusting their face masks.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102865581408207848855/reviews
Freeze,3,"I added $2 more fish slices and the portion is very reasonable. Fish is fresh and the soup is flavourful. Only complain is, the rice thrown in the soup could have been cooked softer. It came out dry and beady..",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115678951719125154164/reviews
Js Ye,1,"The meat in the soup is not cooked and when i approach the staff, she mentioned that their meat is coated with flour and insist that is cooked.

She didn’t apologise nor did she offer any solutions. I only get a refund after i informed to post online about the raw meat in the soup.

To alert all customer, check the meat or food before eating (see photos for facts)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110113109212329877984/reviews
Min HL,5,"A fan of the 干捞面 here as the noodles are springy and flavourful 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

Wawa Wii,2,Been eating this Kway Teow Soup for years. Used to be very flavourful and delicious. But the fish sticks are getting less crispy. Sometimes I tasted some sourness (Chao-Sng - like leftover until spoilt) Soup wise is like near clear soup without much taste~ Other outlets still fare very well. Hope this Sumang outlet can improve and get back the good old taste. Thank you.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115762649498289235690/reviews
