Haha..\nüåøü´ÑIt's a green lung where residents staying nearby visit for their morning exercise routine.\nüèíThere is a well-shaded spacious Woodball course with 12 fairways (gates).\nAlthough it may seems to been a little neglected.\nü•¨üêà‚Äç‚¨õüë£Other features include a Therapeutic Garden, an Amphitheatre with Stage, Sand pit Playgrounds, Dog Run, Allotment Garden, Fitness Corner and Sense Discovery Garden.\n‚òÄÔ∏èAround the spacious park, sun motiff features prominently.\nüåºAn interesting feature to note is that all the footpaths at Sun Plaza Park converge to form a sun motif, true to the Park's name.\nüöäHow to get here:\nThe nearest MRT is Tampines MRT Station.",

It‚Äôs tranquil with children playing at the sandy playground and seniors chilling and relaxing on benches inside the park. A welcoming respite from the busy Tampines hood. Loads of roosters and its family of chickens roaming freely and happily.",

The huge & tall trees actually make the park very cooling!\n\nKudos to the staff who help to keep the park so clean and nice for all!\n\nI see many elderly taking their morning walk there & many domestic helpers on Sunday off also can be seen having their picnic there.\n\nLoves the greenery in the park and I will definitely visit the park again & in fact more often from now on :-)",

This park is part of a park connector which connects to the Bedok reservoir and Pasir Ris park connector.\nIt is well shaded and is a good place to chill. I had the opportunity to chance upon a trio of  ladies practicing Christmas tunes on their ukulele and they gave us an impromptu performance. Perfect!",
