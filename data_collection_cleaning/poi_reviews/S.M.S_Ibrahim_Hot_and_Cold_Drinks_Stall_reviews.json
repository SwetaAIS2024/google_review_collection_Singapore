Not too sweet, and the smaller cendol sipped through the normal size straw.  Happy with the purchase.\n\nWill try other drinks in the future.",

The boss was so smiley and nice and offer to serve the 3 drinks to our table for me.  We ordered the less sweet teh tarik, it was really good.  Will be back..",
