Edvina,5,"In 2020, when my dog fell sick—vomiting and not eating well—I initially brought him to a nearby vet that was open at the time. They recommended hospitalizing him with an IV drip and assured me he would recover in 3–4 days. However, his condition showed no improvement. A family member then recommended Animal Ark, and I immediately transferred my dog there. Upon arrival, Dr. Joyce and the team were professional, efficient, and quick to suspect the presence of a foreign object. They recommended an ultrasound and X-ray, which confirmed their suspicion. Thanks to their swift action, they performed emergency surgery and saved my dog’s life. When a similar incident happened again this year, I had complete confidence that my dog was in safe hands with Dr. Joyce and the team. I highly recommend this vet clinic—your beloved pets will truly be well cared for.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104995130752454206411/reviews
Wendy Dang,5,"Brought my 3 yo maltipoo to get his fractured canine tooth restored. Dr Regina did a detail examine on him and solve his dental issues on the same visit. Dr Regina and her Team only took about 1hr 40 mins to finish tooth restoration, baby tooth extraction as well as a full mouth dental scaling. Receptionist is also very friendly. Will definitely recommend all pet owners to come to Animal Ark Mandai for pets dental issue with Dr Regina.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107390688414249269660/reviews
Yuni Pien,5,"Went there to do a comprehensive blood test and microchip for my 10 year old cat. The process was smooth and quick. The staff were friendly and nice, knew how to handle my cat very well. A little pricey and location was totally out of the way but for a good service and knowing that my cat is in good hands, it's all worth it! Thank you for treating Sarang ❤️",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105684066115536994353/reviews
Carol,5,"My dog had a few vomit episodes and felt unwell. Though I have some anti-vomit medicine and pain relief to standby at home which I fed him, he continued to shiver occasionally.

2 days later, I decided to bring him to consult a vet. But all vet clinics, including our regular vets, were fully booked nor accept walk in. Only Animal Ark Mandai answered our distress call on a late Friday afternoon 25/4/25 and immediately asked us to come into their clinic 1 hour later.

When we reached the clinic, we were caught in heavy rain and were a bit drenched. The staff Wen Qi and Ricardo were very nice, immediately handled us a towel to dry ourselves.

We consulted with Dr. Soh. She was very patient and thorough in her exam and explanation. She was not pushy. Together with vet tech Ricardo, both were extremely loving and gentle in handling my dog.

I noticed my dog felt very relaxed in the clinic. He was not scared nor shivered during Dr. Soh’s exam. While waiting for test results, I decided to feed him some food. Dr. Soh was very nice & considerate to lay out a pee pad for him to eat and relax comfortably. My boy was curious and eager to explore the clinic instead! Lol.

As we were the last patient, I took awhile to call a taxi. Ricardo was so nice to stay back to wait with us, even accompanied us in the carpark to wait for the taxi ensuring we safely got on the taxi before locking the gate.

AVH Mandai is also very prompt on WhatsApp communication with us post consultation. Immediately when Dr. Soh returned to duty, she gave me a follow up call to check on my dog’s condition. While Dr. Soh was off duty, other vets on duty were prompt in responding to my queries regarding diets, other symptoms and medicine dosages too.

A week has passed. My dog is feeling better, his condition is improving daily.

I am extremely grateful to AVH Mandai team for their caring & loving service to me & my dog.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109802056488653471421/reviews
