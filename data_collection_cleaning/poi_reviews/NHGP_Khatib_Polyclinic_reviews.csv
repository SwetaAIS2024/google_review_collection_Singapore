Sandie Heong,5,"SCS order Mammogram at this newly polyclinic as their machine undergo services.  I took a train and started my journey early down to Khatib MRT , even if it was nearer for NorthEast residents.  The polyclinic is located diagonally from Khatib MRT station.  From the gantry, turn to your right, walked straight till the four road junction.  Cross to the opposite by using the traffic lights.  You are anle to see the moment you stand at the traffic junction .

Staff were early, and the system started at 07.30 am automatically .  I liked the place because it's spacious for wheelchair, personal automobile,  and healthy eater for residents who need to break fasted blood tests.   There was also a HEALTH room for active ageing events.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103416532981981889957/reviews

Nurul Khai,4,"Visit on Sat, 7 Sept 2024.

Pro: It's not crowded. Fast from doc to pharmacy, take about less than 1 hour.

Con: Issue with the Healthhub Appt for Khatib Poly, doc consult (normal consult) wait for 10pm appt on Fri  there's no appt slot try again on Sat, 7:30am  also no slot. In the end select the doc consult - cough there's appt slot.

I'm sorry to say but I got to transfer back the appt to Ys poly  as they have an online appt slot on Sat.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109888189480453990297/reviews
Callie Ho,5,"First time in the new Khatib Polyclinic to have my teeth checked out, as I have really sensitive tooth.

I had an excellent experience with Dr. Camine Yeo. She is incredibly meticulous and thorough, especially during scaling and polishing. Itâ€™s clear she takes great pride in her work and pays close attention to detail, ensuring a comfortable and effective cleaning. I appreciated how gentle she was throughout the procedure while still being very precise. My teeth felt noticeably cleaner and smoother afterward. Yay!
Dr. Yeo also took the time to explain everything clearly, which helped me feel at ease.
Highly recommend to visit this polyclinic for dental issues. May not be able request doctors but I suppose all of them are really professional.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100418708660949931901/reviews
