Aircon is sufficient during mid afternoon.\nWe went there with Eatigo reservation with 50% on food. So the price is reasonable; but discount is not applicable for drinks.\nWill I be back? Yes, if with discount.",

There is a room for improvement, but for this price point, I wouldn’t recommend it for first timers trying out Turkish dish. I will change my review if we would dine in here again.",

The interior is cool and comfortable, and the staff are incredibly friendly.\nThe hummus, which I tried for the first time, had a rich, nutty flavor. The baklava was just the right amount of sweet, and the pistachios added a perfect texture. I was completely blown away by the Turkish coffee—it was absolutely delicious.\nThe prices were reasonable, and this place is a must-visit if you're ever in Singapore.",
