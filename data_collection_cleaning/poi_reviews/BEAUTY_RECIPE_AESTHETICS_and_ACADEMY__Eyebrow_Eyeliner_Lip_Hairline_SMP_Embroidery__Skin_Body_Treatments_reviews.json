      "text": "I bought a session for lip embroidery via a FB live stream. I was told that the lip embroidery needs at least 2 sessions when I arrived for the embroidery on 17 December 2022. However, I did not buy another session for touching up.  I was very disappointed with the lip embroidery.  It was out of my lip line on that day. And I was told by the sales manager, Lavin, I need to patiently wait and see the result.  It is still out of line till now and yet they are not taking any responsibility for the issue.  Keep repeatedly asking me to buy for another touch up session but no guarantees for the result.",

      "text": "I went eyebrow tattoo removal yesterday and the process was painful and bad despite the numbing cream. The lady who assisted me did the first pain test and started poking me with the needle and even CONTINUED after I told her it hurts.\n\nPlease note that I have a high pain tolerance and their numbing cream is good because I felt almost little to no pain for the 3 sessions of eyebrow tattoo I had with them. So either the process for brow removal is a VERY painful process, or they changed the numbing cream.\n\nAlso, the lady shaved my brow without permission and made it uneven. I did not notice it until I was in the MRT and looked at myself through the front cam. I texted the number and there are no replies despite them still being opened.\n\nSo please check before leaving the store so you can physically talk to them about it.",

      "text": "The eye brow embroidery is not well done as the colour is imbalance after recovery and the feedback from the staff is touchup is needed for another $250. For your information, this is not my 1st time doing brows. The service I paid for the 1st brow at this shop is already $350 and now $250 for touchup is really exaggerating. They will only entertain you if you paid for the touchup. For the location and service, I can get any better places. Thank you!",

      "text": "Alright, so I thought I’d give this semi-permanent makeup course a shot, but man, what a letdown! The instructor’s English was all over the place, making it hard to follow along. And the so-called ‘academy’? Picture a dingy warehouse that doubles as a makeshift classroom talk about a lack of ambiance and fresh air!\n\nAnd as for their diploma? Don’t bother. It’s about as valuable as Monopoly money. Sure, they’ll hand you a certificate, but it’s as sketchy as their false advertising. Remember that ‘Korean-made’ rotary machine? Well, surprise, it’s straight out of China, no labels or brands in sight.\n\nAnd the pigments? They might as well be selling colored water from their outlet. No labels, no descriptions it’s like playing makeup roulette. And the price they’re charging for this circus? Totally not worth it. Oh, and those ‘professional’ lights? More like something you’d find in a dorm room.\n\nSave your time and money, and find a legit course elsewhere.",
