I shared with him that i prefer to install my Magicseal outside the windows, as I‚Äôve sliding windows and I stay first floor.\nBryan gave his professional advice, suggesting what kind of frame and to install on which window panel so as not to block the view!\nThe fabrication of the product didn‚Äôt take long, only took roughly a week!\nMr Yong & Mr Chong did a fabulous work on site! the team is efficient, with good workmanship. I‚Äôd highly recommend Magicseal!! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",
