      "text": "I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Senior TCM Therapist Hui Min for her professionalism and patience. Every consultation with her is thorough and detailed. She takes the time to carefully assess your condition and tailors the treatment accordingly. Hui Min also shares valuable advice on lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, to help address the root cause of health issues.\n\nAfter giving birth, I suffered from persistent back pain and never expected it to be linked to my weak spleen, stomach digestion issues, and changes in my bone structure. Hui Min‚Äôs professional insights and personalized treatment have made a huge difference in my recovery. Her holistic approach and dedication to resolving the root causes of pain are truly commendable.\n\nThank you, Hui Min, for your exceptional care and for helping me regain my health and well-being! Highly recommended!",

After filling up my details, I was brought to the consultation room for consultation by Physician Nick. He was very patient and explain to me my condition after assessment. After which I was brought to another room for postural assessment by Physician Hui Min. She explained my condition and told me about my treatment plan. She led me to one of the treatment rooms and started treatment together with Physician Nick starting off with acupuncture. After my treatment, she provided me with some tips on my posture. She did explain to me about their package but was not pushy for sales. She also did not ask me to book immediately for my next appointment. She only told me to call or sms them should I need their service. üëçüëç",
