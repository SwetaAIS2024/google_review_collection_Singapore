Jordan Eng,1,"Drove 3 hours to JKR for my 9am appointment set by them. Arrive at 8.30am. Waited patiently for my appointment in the meeting roon. Saw one old man with Jkorp docs (another client) entering their office. It was 11am and I saw this same old man left the office. When this old man left, the meeting room door suddenly open. Unfortunately, my appointment only lasted 30 mins at most with the head of JKR who wasnt really helpful nor understanding of a developer financial situation. Other JKR from other states are faster, efficient, helpful and more understanding. Why this Johor JKR is sooo lacking in almost every area? Does this JKR need kopi money?? I thought we are past that already. Terrible.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104480918907406124986/reviews
Jon Lee,1,"To develop a small piece of area, a developer has to fork out a huge sum of money to widen the existing main road of almost half a kilometre, install a traffic light and a divider? Why is this needed in a town/city of 300k population? Ridiculous. I never seen this in any other cities or town. Plus all these should be under the expense of JKR.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105564863619026822491/reviews
