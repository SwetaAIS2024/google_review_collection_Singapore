Ashley P,5,"This stall is really a gem that my husband and I chanced upon after a stroll at Botanic Gardens! We had their fish and chips which was so good. The quality of the fish used is great - itâ€™s not Dory but I think Pollack (similar texture as McDonaldâ€™s fish fillet). Fries were well fried, salad was fresh and dressing was refreshing. Portions are big too. We visited for a second time within a week! The owners are really friendly and take pride in their food. We sat near the shop and the owners were so sweet to bring the food to us despite us being provided with a buzzer.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114316705184693939656/reviews
Shaolin Leong,4,"Newly opened & operated by a couple & their nephew served wonderful western grilled chicken chop and mentaiko salmon. Formerly a chef in a Japanese Restaurant.
Refine,fresh & fusion .Closed on Monday.
Chilli ðŸ¦€sauce & salted egg chicken chop are something different  !
They are meticulous so even presentation is done in a neat & tidy manner.
Recently revamped their new menu . Even better !! With lots of side dishes mushroom soup ,spaghetti ,mashed potato & salad.
Mentaiko chicken burger with fries is good too ! Support our hawkers !!! They work very hard to provide us with tasty & quality food at a reasonable price  ! Don't stare at the menu  just try & ask you will not be disappointed.

Quality over price !!! If you are always on a hawker center budget then they are not for you ! Remember everyone needs an upgrade !

ming Goh,5,"Western food with fresh and fusion concept. All their sauces are homemade. Chef got years of restaurant experience, partner wife is friendly and responsive. If you are ordering in bulk you can call them in advance.

I have tried the fish and chips. The fish is good quality cod fish, not the normal dory fish given elsewhere. Value for money!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112506657048870265687/reviews
felly pelly,3,"Visited on a Wednesday evening and there was no crowd. We were handed a buzzer and waited ~10mins for our orders. Chicken chop was nicely done with a crisp skin, french fries are also lightly salted, mashed potatoes are good too! Would advise against ordering their steak but go for their chicken dishes. The chicken chopâ€™s portion was just nice for its price ~$8",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105782656786725506496/reviews
Paul Ram,5,"Recommend this western food place at Empress food centre(Farrer Rd). Ordered a plate of fish & chips. As seen in the pic, it was worth $8, with veggies & sides. Cooked fresh upon order. Fish was whitefish unlike cheap dory and tasted more like cod. Friendly staff too. Closed on Mondays I think. Will visit again to try other dishes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114518784932559926754/reviews
