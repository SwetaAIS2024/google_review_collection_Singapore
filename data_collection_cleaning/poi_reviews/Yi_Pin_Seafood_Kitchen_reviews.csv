Rick Ng,5,Tried Yi Pin's Hokkien Mee and was amazed by its delicious flavours. This dish is more like a seafood Hokkien mee with addition of lala (white clams) to typical prawns and calamari. It has nice flavours and not salty. One of the better Hokkien mee that I have tried. Will go back for more.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103499781517934198543/reviews
Ian,1,"This is a non-smoking coffeeshop, but people are always smoking at the tables and cause the whole area to reek of 2nd hand smoke. There are many kids here as there is a Sparketots above. The operator is turning a blind eye to it. Reported to NEA for follow up.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112389840306682350987/reviews
Yeo Abby,5,"Atmosphere: normal coffeeshop ambient but the coffeeshop is new and well ventilated.

Service: good service. The servers are friendly courteous and gives good suggestions.

Food: Sambal stingray, gamheong lala and stir fried potato leaves are awesome 😎😎

Come as a big group to eat quite nice atmosphere.

Can enjoy the other food in this coffee shop",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103568134139839906471/reviews
