The maximum duration you can stay is 2 hours continuous and if you want to stay longer, you need to check-out and check-in again due to Covid-19 safe distance measures which I believe is understandable.\nThe services are free of charge unless you need to borrow books. Their website has all the fee details if you need to get the membership.\nOverall, it's a lovely place to study/ read with peace of mind!",
