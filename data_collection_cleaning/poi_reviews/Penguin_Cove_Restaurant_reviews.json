The rice is blend and the cutlet  is just full of flour. The will occasionally bump in penguin food so that the penguin will swim under water and you will get a good view of the penguins.\n\nWe ordered the penguin buns to bring home and to our surprise, we have to pay $2 for the box. We decided to skip the boxes but they only put them into individual paper bag and no carrier is given üò∞üò∞\nAnyway, my kids were disappointed that the penguin buns were kind of ‚Äúdistorted‚Äù by the time we reached home. The bun only has very little fillings and mostly just bun üòÖ",
