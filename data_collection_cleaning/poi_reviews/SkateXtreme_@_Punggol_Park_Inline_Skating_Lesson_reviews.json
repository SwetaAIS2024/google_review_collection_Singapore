      "text": "The classes are not very well organised. Basically students queue up to practice drills for the session, and when competent they will be allowed to progress to the next level. But the ratio  is 1 instructor to 15-20 students. Also as an added “bonus”, there is a chubby instructor (who is not even wearing skates) who will shout condescending comments at you for motivation/embarrassment when you fall down. Join at own risk. I guess you pay for what you get.",

The instructor only came to our group of adult learners 30 mins after class started, did some demos and scooted off. Class size is too big to get sufficient attention. Wouldn't recommend if you want enough attention and instructions to at least pick up fundamental skills.",
