Ivan Teh,5,"Kway Chap (SGD $6.80) @ Da Cheng Kway Chap.
.
Established by Ser Siang Koo years before May 2015, this humble stall offers a wider variety of braised pig offals than elsewhere.
.
From the crunchy braised pig's ears, to the tender large intestines, to the chewy braised pig's tongue, each is well stewed in their signature herb and spice infused soy stock.
.
Alongside other ingredients like bouncy braised chicken egg and spongy dried tofu puffs, each piece has absorbed the light salty savoury herbal earthy sweet flavour from the stock.
.
The slippery smooth sheets of wide flat kway teow / rice noodles are served in the same light soup / broth, flavoured with fried shallots, spring onions, and coriander, lending a burst of grainy vegetal salty herbal sweet flavour.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114332345573544911646/reviews
Pak Soon Lau,4,"Authentic taste of local Chinese hawker food, though a bit on the salty side. Stirred up a lot of nostalgic memories of the food served here in this area more than 40 years ago before the redevelopment. The prices here are still reasonable.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107524637554500568527/reviews
yan loong,3,"I ordered kway chap. Small bowl of kway
The ingredients being: small and large intestines,  pork belly, fishcake and bean curd  skin. All general ingredients were good but the most important part of the dish was the pork, the pork was tender and soft. This place is far from my place so I will rarely come here, but if I do pass by, I will come re visit again",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116098756752263508313/reviews
EQ Xavier,3,"Average bowl of rice noodle soup, it's soft and tender, slips into your throat easily. The meal comes with fish cake with chilli, pork intestines with a bit of funky aftertaste, tou fun which is pretty decent, braised egg which needs a bit more soaking, the pork belly can be more tender. Maybe I came about 8 in the morning, the ingredients are not soaked enough in the salty broth. Nice auntie cooking at the store and they accept cashless payment",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533019712721928126/reviews
