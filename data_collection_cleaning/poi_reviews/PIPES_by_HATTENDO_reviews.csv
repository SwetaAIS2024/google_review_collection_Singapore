WL Lee,5,"A little pricey, but good value for money, for a good selection of high quality Japanese style sandwiches. The thick, tender and juicy pork katsu was my personal favourite, even though I’d suggest sharing it cuz of the large serving size and it could feel a tad oily after a while.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103239701894589553988/reviews

Lance Tan,5,"Located just outside exit 4 of Outram Park MRT, this Japanese cafe serves freshly grounded coffee with many different blends of coffee to choose from. They also serve Sandos (sandwiches), which can be customised to your liking, and also burgers and finger foods as well.

The atmosphere of this cafe is lovely, with very little human traffic in the morning, and friendly staff. Enjoying my cup of coffee while chilling to the well curated Japanese playlist just makes my mornings so much better.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103171518127946119222/reviews
Cindy Ong,5,"Great and excellent cup of cappuccino with bold flavors, (it’s double shot) perfect choice of beans used.
Located at a cool quiet corner, ample seats for a weekday afternoon coffee break.
A surprisingly great place for coffee although this place is famous for their sando. (Japanese sandwiches)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114791460553722778203/reviews
