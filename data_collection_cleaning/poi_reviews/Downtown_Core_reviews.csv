Jules Cates (Jules),5,"My time in Singapore was a lovely one, spent the short time exploring all of the downtown area by the river bridge, Merlion Park and the Marina Bay Sands that housed the Gardens by the bay..must see attraction.

Lots to see and do in downtown including many restaurants/bars, luxury shopping and it's many hotels with area attractions surrounding the Waterfront Promenade.

It's bustling with people at any time of the day of the week...whether it's tourists or the locals themselves...their street markets is my absolute favorite like Lau Pa Sat...a lovely place to finish off the day with good food, along with some Satay's on the street outside.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112064282621849519349/reviews
Hữu Lâm,5,"The first place when I went to Singapore to study is this place!!! It was in the morning, me and my roommates decided to take a stroll in order to sightseeing the city and discover MarinaBay.

When reached here, I couldn’t picture the landscape here will be gorgeous as Western Countries as we see on the Internet!

I can see the full view of high buildings from here. Local people is really hospitable and into taking excersise!!

If someone in Asea do want to travel a country, definitely I will recommend Singapore and Việt Nam",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110129343504619896070/reviews

Sudipto Guha,4,"A great place to visit in downtown Singapore if you want to get a feel of the skyline, walk around taking in the views of the city. There are a lot of trees lining the path and it's a popular place for cyclists, joggers and runners. You can easily have lunch in the CBD or go for a spot of shopping in the Marina Bay Sands from this park.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104332861633474724713/reviews
