Catherine Goh,5,"It’s great seeing such great quality vegetables and fruits being sold jn the heartland. And at heartland price. It’s my usual go to for HUGE crunchy and sweet green grapes, seasonal fruits such as Australian white peaches, uber fresh salads and baby spinach; not to mention the heirloom tomatoes! Keep it up!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117456296229518057665/reviews

Asc C,1,"This is about this store as a Shopee parcel collection point. The smaller, skinnier uncle and one auntie were very very pleasant to interact with. Perhaps they are the shopowners. Good for them 👍🏻

But there's this taller, plump young guy who is very unpleasant — he has a ""don't bother me"" attitude during collection, as if we are the ones at fault to collect our parcels from him. Please go find your dream job, or work with machines if you can't offer decent customer service! It's a shame to have you tending the store.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100983519177801691463/reviews
