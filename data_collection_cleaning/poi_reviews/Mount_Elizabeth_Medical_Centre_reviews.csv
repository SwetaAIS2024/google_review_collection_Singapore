Leonardo Hernandez,5,"The review is for the Urgent Care Centre, and fortunately, we didn't need any exams during this visit. I didn't expect to go to the ER for my 8-month-old son since he wasn't feeling well, but the staff, from the front desk to the nurses, were all very welcoming. The doctor was very friendly and patient; he spoke English very well.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117588708349608205688/reviews

Glenn Wong,5,"A premium private hospital with excellent facilities and medical practitioners. While the fees are also premium, you generally get fast consultation appointments versus public hospital and more dedicated medical attention. Popular with locals and foreigners from the ASEAN countries. Parking is the only negative aspect due to very limited space. The saving grace is turnaround time is quite fast, usually if you can wait a bit you will get a lot.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111266038196750069636/reviews
