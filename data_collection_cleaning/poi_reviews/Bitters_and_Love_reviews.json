      "text": "I loved their cocktails! Especially the Kaya Toast Cocktail. The only thing got disappointed was they didn’t tell us that the kitchen was closing at 10pm. We were seated at around 9:40pm, ordered cocktails and fish tacos. We were still hungry bc we didn’t had dinner so we tried to order more food, but they said kitchen is closed already. Though overall, the ambiance, food and cocktails are good. I would come back and would definitely reco this bar, especially that the bar is very near our hotel (The Clan)",
