Amalina Mansor,5,"Long overdue review.

I first saw Dr Edwin when he was working at another clinic. Dr Edwin was easygoing and knowledgeable. When I was looking to make another appointment with him, I saw he had set up RMDY clinic and didn't hesitate to book an appointment there. Amazingly, he remembered my name and kept my record. Dr Edwin is always happy to answer questions/concerns and is very passionate about preventive care.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109411640921039323891/reviews
summer qiu,5,"Dr. Edwin is knowledgeable and super nice. He's really easy to talk to and makes kids feel at ease during check-ups. He knows just the right way to keep kids and old folks calm. He goes the extra mile to ask more questions and dig deeper.

He asks about our medical history with great care and spots those little red flags for us. We really appreciate his professional approach and highly recommend Dr. Edwin's clinic.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114697124306728190386/reviews
