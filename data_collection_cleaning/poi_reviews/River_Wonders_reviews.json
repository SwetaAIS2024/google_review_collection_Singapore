It is informative and so much fun interacting with these special creatures. The pandas were active early in the day but sleepy later in the day. Highly recommend this stop if you have time. 30 dollar grab ride from the city.",

      "text": "We spent a delightful afternoon at Mandai River Wonders from 2pm to 6pm January 1st. A highlight was the fish feeding session around 2:15pm. Following the staff’s guidance was highly recommended. They provided insightful information about the species,their origins, and more. The fish were incredibly active during feeding.\n\nWhile we missed the schedule show due to getting engrossed in the feeding sessions, we enjoyed a short 10min boat ride for 5sgd per pax. Unfortunately, due to light rain, we didn’t spot monkeys. However, we were thrilled to see active jaguars roaming its enclosure, making the ride worthwhile.\n\nThe Amazon flooded forest exhibit was an absolute favourite. The impressive walkway, spanning two levels, offered fantastic views of manatees. The unique perspective is truly a sight to behold.",

      "text": "River Wonders is an incredible attraction that often gets overshadowed by the nearby Singapore Zoo, but it deserves equal recognition. Home to hundreds of species, including adorable giant pandas in air-conditioned comfort, it offers a unique experience that captivates visitors. The Amazon River safari water ride is a highlight, providing a beautiful and immersive journey through diverse ecosystems. Hats off to Singapore for creating such a stunning place that showcases the wonders of our planet's rivers and wildlife. It’s a must-visit for anyone looking to explore the beauty of nature in a delightful setting!",

      "text": "Walking into Panda Forest was like stepping into a cool, peaceful world. The stars of the show are, of course, the pandas. They're so chill, just munching on bamboo all day without a care in the world. Watching them do their thing is super cute and kind of calming. There's also a bunch of easy-to-read signs around that tell you all about pandas. I learned some stuff without it feeling like school. It's pretty cool to find out how these guys live and what's being done to keep them around. By the end of the day, I was wishing I could just hang out like a panda, eating and snoozing in the forest. Who wouldn't want that kind of laid-back life?",
