We both ordered the HK Braised Beef Brisket Noodles in soup, and it was a fantastic choice. The dish was served piping hot, the beef was incredibly tender, and the flavors were spot on. It was the perfect comforting meal before a long flight, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended for travelers passing through Terminal 4!",

It felt like they used a different type of pork rib and the way it was cooked just wasn’t the same. Really disappointing compared to my previous orders.",

Wanton is edible (but feels like frozen CP wantons); lettuce is tasteless and super small in portion; mala soup is just weird-tasting with the taste of the noodles seeping into the mala soup without any umami.\n\nSaving grace for them was the signature chilli sauce that they have on the side for free, with the green pickled chilli slices. Or else, everything doesn't have taste whatsoever.",
