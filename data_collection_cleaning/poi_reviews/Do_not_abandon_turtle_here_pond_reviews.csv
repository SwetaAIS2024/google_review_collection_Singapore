Forest BK,5,"üê¢The Turtle Pond is an interesting feature around the Punggol Point Park.
üê¢üê¢Many amazing turtles sunbathing.
üê¢Children will definitely be fascinated by the sight of these lovely-looking sunbathing turtles.
üí¶Can consider having some kind of water aeration system to improve it's water quality.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Grik Chai,4,"It‚Äôs quite unique as it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen a pond in a park with only turtles. However, the water quality seems poor and neglected. Many people feed the turtles, which makes the water even worse. There are also many pigeons coming to eat.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106151419257453329636/reviews

Tiger Heng,1,"As a turtle lover, I feel very sad for the plight of the red ear sliders (freshwater turtles) here. These are abandoned animals, irresponsible pet owners threw them into this water feature that has no flowing water or filter, most turtles are sick (respiratory infection and metabolic bone disease), respiratory infection is a disease that can spread to other turtles living in the same water.

Algae growth also too rapid, suggesting too high a nitrate level - too much turtle poo and pee, + leftover food (fed by visitors) also causes turtles to fall sick.

By the way, these are freshwater turtles NOT tortoises. Turtles are semi-aquatic, and needs to swallow in water. Tortoises are land-dwellers and cannot swim, and will drown. There are NO wild tortoises in SG.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105418563966572008719/reviews
Alexander Reinaldo,5,"Calming and relaxing Pond full of Tortoise, many of them can be spotted sunbathibg from 10-1pm, though those with kids may one to exercise caution as some of them have quite sharp claws and can be quite aggresive. Spotted rare curved up shells tortoise too, but did not manage to get the picture.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108446373348289716691/reviews
