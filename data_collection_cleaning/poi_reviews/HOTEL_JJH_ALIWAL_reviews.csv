Rahmawati Husein,5,"Room is small but ok for just spend nights, as the whole day were outside. Hot shower is nice, they have toilet shower. Location is the best close to all culinary places. Especially during ramadhan, where kampong gelam has food bazaar. The hotel also 3 minutes from Sultan Mosque.. I stay 5 nights",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116152994104798230051/reviews

Damn Loretta,2,"The room I stayed in could barely fit my luggages and the window is slightly open even when it‚Äôs locked shut so you can actually still hear the sound from outside (people talking, cars passing by). Also, there were no shelves in the bathroom so it was difficult to place my toiletries anywhere in the bathroom. Also, it was quite noisy - people slamming doors. The plus point is that the bed was quite comfortable and the location is good. Other than that, I did not get enough sleep for the nights I stayed here because of the noises (even with earplugs).",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113037126469864380111/reviews
