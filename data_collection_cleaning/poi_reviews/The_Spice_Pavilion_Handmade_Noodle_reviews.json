Super hearty & robust soup, they could easily cut back thier portions by 30% because I have never finished the bowl the few times I’ve been here. I had the Tom yum chicken ban Mian a few times and it’s super delicious. It’s slightly on the sweeter side but so good.",

Price also very good at $5.50 per bowl.\n\nLove that it had ngoh hiang as a side too! Not sure if this is normal price... but it was delicious!",

I always go for Dried You Mian every time I come here, because the flavourful gravy always succeeds in making me come back for more. The chilli sauce used was very spicy personally though, but that had not stopped me from returning!",
