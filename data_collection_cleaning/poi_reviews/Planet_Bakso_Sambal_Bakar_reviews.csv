Faisal Sani,2,"First time i visited this new ""tik tok viral"" Planet Bakso malay eatery stall at Jalan Teck Whye coffee shop. On 31 January 2025 Friday night, which I assumed 2 days of Chinese New year public holiday (CNY) has ended before and it is a Malay eatery stall. For your info, I am not living around jalan teck whye. So I am giving here my experience there.

Upon my arrival of the mentioned coffee shop at night, I looked afar and saw that a big muscular malay guy was carrying a guni sack of rice into the Planet bakso stall and I thought they were closed. So as to not wasted my trip there, I approached the stall cashier. There it was the big muscular malay guy standing at the stall cashier. I asked him politely, ""are you guys still open or close for business"". His replied was very rude like customer's owe him money in a way, ""why you asked, can't you see that we are here"".

So as I not to have any further uncomfortable experience with that stall, I just ordered my dishes as I want to see what is so viral about their dishes.

Upon my ordering of my dishes to the big muscular malay guy, I noticed at the cashier there is a sign displayed indicating that a bowl of soup is chargeable at $1. So I continued my order of 1 dish ""rusuk bakar with sambal hijau"" and 1 dish ""ayam goreng with sambal gami"", to dine in. Then the mentioned guy asked me, ""any soup for me"". I replied ""no"". Because I knew he will charged an additional $1 for each soup.

Then I paid for both of my 2 dishes which he did not hand me my receipt. So After paying i asked the guy, ""can I have my receipt"". He replied in a blur face, ""oh ok... I will give your receipt upon collection of your dishes"".

The reason why I asked for my receipt is to know what is the breakdown of prices that I ordered and why the cost is slightly higher.

Then true enough after collecting my both dishes from the stall, I was shocked to see on my receipt that the malay eatery stall charged their customers an additional $1 CNY surcharge for each dish. Without letting their customers know about these additional CNY surcharges before customer start to order at the cashier. No signages were displayed about this CNY surcharge at their stall.

As for their dish tasting:
1) rusuk bakar with sambal hijau - my rating is 2/5. The meat was chewy like rubber band which stuck in between my teeth and the meat gravy taste was bland. Nothing special at all. Only their sambal hijau was very spicy. The rice was ok for me.

2) ayam goreng with sambal gami - my rating is 2.5/5. The sambal gami is very very spicy and it was more to oily spicy type. The rice was ok and The fried chicken is ok too. Nothing ""wow"" factor taste of this dish. Just a typical dish.

Maybe because their viral dishes is just for Bakso dishes and not other else. But too bad, i don't eat bakso dishes. Well we are a paying customers and this is my experience and opinions. So this will be my 1st and last time visiting this ""planet bakso"" stall. There are more other eatery brands of good nicer tasting dishes and better customer service to visit in Singapore.

Ps: see my attached photos taken and receipt. I indicated in green arrow to show the big muscular malay guy at the cashier but he noticed me and turned his back while I took this photo from afar. Also, see my receipt which indicates the CNY surcharge. Anyone who cannot eat spicy sambal, you can just don't eat their sambal. Because it is very spicy. No joke about this as photos can be deceiving.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104477553258816382365/reviews
