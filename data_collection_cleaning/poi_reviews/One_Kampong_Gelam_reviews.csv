Kathleen Lau,3,"SAVE KAMPONG GELAM

Although it might be impossible to go back to the days when Cafe Le Caire Al-Majlis was king, where you really felt the flavour of the Muslim Quarter in the city centre just strolling around at any time of day, when we had shisha in the alleys, danced to the music of local bands at BluJaz and also had beautiful Arab restaurants to eat and learn culture at.....

The business mix in the area is going from acceptable to worrying, walking around these days.

The constant busloads of tourists not only erodes the calm and peace, but also contributes to the tenant make-up.

Im afraid if this is allowed to continue, Kampong Gelam will only exist in name in the future.
