Gabriellius Le,5,"ðŸŽ¨ Discover the Vibrant Street Art of Katong-Joo Chiat! ðŸŽ¨

Tanjong Katong and Joo Chiat, with their unique history and strong food culture, are home to some incredible street art. Let's explore the colorful murals that grace the walls of this district:

1. Katong Joo Chiat Art Circuit: Many of the earlier murals here are a result of the Katong Joo Chiat Art Circuit (KJC Art Circuit) organized by The Admin SG and commissioned by the Singapore Tourism Board to revitalize the area. These murals tell stories about the history of Katong Joo Chiat. One notable mural is ""High Tide"" by Helene Le Chatelier, which depicts the area's past floods and features a poem by Singaporean poet Christine Chia.

2. Brilliant Corners: In November 2020, the Brilliant Corners project involved 5 Singaporean artists painting around the Mountbatten, Katong, and Joo Chiat area as part of the Arts in Your Neighbourhoodvinitiative by the National Arts Council. These artworks were created through conversations with residents and even collaborations with students. Curated playlists accompany the murals, enhancing the viewing experienceÂ¹.

3. Artwalk Festival: The Artwalk Festival, organized by LaSalle School of the Arts, expanded its borders in 2022 to include Katong-Joo Chiat as one of its precincts. The festival has contributed to the proliferation of street art in the area, resulting in several new murals.
