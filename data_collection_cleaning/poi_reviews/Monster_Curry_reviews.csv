Foodie Foodie,5,"Ben is very patience answering my qns. Had asked him some qns a few times & he is always patience. Ren Jie although not familiar with the voucher things, but also done a good job in being available for customer always. The last trip when I came, hard to get someone when we need something. This time Ren Jie is fast to respond. Will come again",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105347395701048499484/reviews
AC Chan,5,"Cubes of sweet, crunchy toast and scoop of luxurious H√§agen-Dazs vanilla ice cream accompanied with whipped cream, strawberries and blueberries was too tempting to resist. I ended up ordering 2 plates to satiate my cravings.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Ken Tan,4,"Tried the Mega lunch set yaki beef curry comes with ice lemon tea, mushroom soup and a scoop of ice cream.  Curry rice taste good though soup is too salty for me and ice tea is kinda sweet despite stated 5% sugar.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100121205735734303463/reviews
Isabella Teong,5,"All this for just $9.90 between 2-6pm! No GST or service charge charged at all. Drink and chili sauce tub all normal size. Super value meal for a restaurant these days üëçüëç

Love the waiter's service too! He was a one man army serving everyone at lunch hour, blending drinks, prepping takeout containers, serving food, taking payment etc. Very polite too. Would love if restaurant can put names of cashiers on receipts so we can properly applaud him. But in any case, pleasant experience today! Will definitely return again!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115583819344195287025/reviews
Lee Noven,1,"Went to takeaway a meal. First time taking away. Curry not given. Thought they will give curry since I ordered it, and is in the store name. Apparently not.  Take away at own risk.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106061300997984948115/reviews
