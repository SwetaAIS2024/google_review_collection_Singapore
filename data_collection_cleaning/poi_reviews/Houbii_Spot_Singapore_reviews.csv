Felicia Seet,5,"Itâ€™s always a fun time for the kids when visiting the Zoo and they always request to stop by at houbii for some extra fun!! Itâ€™s challenging, exciting and pushes them to be braver and open to new challenges!

Shirley Tung,5,"Visiting the newly revamped @houbiispotsg was an exhilarating experience for both me and my kids. With 3 levels and 74 obstacles, itâ€™s a heaven for adventure seekers of all ages.

The range of obstacles is impressive, catering to different skill levels. From easy crossings for beginners to challenging climbs for the more adventurous, thereâ€™s something for everyone.

Safety is a top priority here. The staff was attentive, ensuring everyone was properly harnessed and briefed on safety protocols.

The new â€˜Tarzanâ€™ obstacle was a hit with my kids. They loved swinging across and pretending to be jungle adventurers. Itâ€™s a great way to get a full-body workout. Climbing, swinging, and balancing work out different muscle groups, making it fun exercise.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106317919913718716517/reviews

McYLLe,5,Looks easy but not however good challenge for the kids. My 9yrs old son tried for 2nd time yet not overcome his fear of height while my 6yrs braved it enough to reached 3rd level on his first try. We will definitely come back ðŸ˜Š,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117553835180250865360/reviews
