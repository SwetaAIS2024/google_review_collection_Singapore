Steve,5,"A lovely lake to sit by and relax for a while.
It's also great to walk along the side, taking in your surroundings.
There's a nice Swan sculpture in the centre of the lake, and on my walk back, there was a Swan floating in the water.
It's also quite clear water, and you get to see the fish",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110825053505813989815/reviews
