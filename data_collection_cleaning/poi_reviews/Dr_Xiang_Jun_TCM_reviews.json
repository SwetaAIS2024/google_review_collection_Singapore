Super thankful to her for helping me get back to my normal routine so quickly.\n\nWent back again today for a sprained back—was in so much pain I could barely walk, bend, or turn. Her acupuncture skills are amazing. After the session, I could actually move without pain! She advised me to take it easy and give it time to heal, so fingers crossed it’ll feel even better after some rest tomorrow. Really appreciate her care and expertise!",

I’ve struggled with flair ups for almost 20 years and just after first few treatments flair ups have subsided and existing patches were already beginning to fade. She also addressed stress/sleep related issues, which I began feeling after just first session. Very knowledgeable and thorough. I would encourage others considering TCM to see her!",
