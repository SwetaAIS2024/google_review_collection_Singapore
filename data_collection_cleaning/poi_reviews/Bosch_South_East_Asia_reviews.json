Contact you guys and promise that will come by today 10am to install.\nNobody is here!!! It’s already 2pm. I have my cleaners here waiting. Call all the numbers on your website n no answer.\nHow can a big company like yours provide such horrendous service. Really regret buying your product.",

      "text": "I bought a Bosch series 6 washer ($1108)  and had a lousy post sale experience with the call agents.\n\nThe washer broke down in 1 year 3 months. Replacement of drum needed but no follow up  by the call centre to date. In spite of it being under warranty, no solutions or interim measures given after the technician came. I was informed by the technician that it would take at least a month for the company to order the spare parts. However, I will need to wait for the relevant team to reach out to me.\n\nThe customer service hotline is not ‘responding’  as the call agents are always busy and they will take ages to reach out to you. My hubby received the call this evening but still no solution provided. What is this lousy service?\n\nStill pending for a response from the relevant team. During this festive LNY period, my family has to spend extra on laundry service and who is going to compensate us. Won’t recommend Bosch for poor quality washer and lousy services.",

      "text": "I would not recommend Bosch. I had a technician visit for an oven replacement and to inspect my gas hob. Initially, I paid $150 for the oven service (additionally total up to $500++), but then I was charged an additional $150 for a follow‐up visit to address the gas hob issue. First visit for the oven service, the technician had mentioned that the gas hob could be repaired that roughly costs $300-$400. Second visit, he mentioned could be fixed with electrician instead or even replaced at a discounted price—but ultimately, there was no stock available, leaving me with extra costs and no solution. Overall, a very disappointing experience.",
