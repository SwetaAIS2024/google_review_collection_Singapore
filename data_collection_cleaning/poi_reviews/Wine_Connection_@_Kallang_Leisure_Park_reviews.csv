A S,5,"Today is my number 10th visit to this Leisure Park Wine Connection outlet since May this year. Not only the varieties of wine and price-tag friendly, but I’m very pleased with the service and wine recommendation i received from this outlet, and I’m truly thankful to Mr. Ricky. His hospitality and his way of recommendation is unparalleled, this could be attributed to his previous hotel management experience. Ricky also remembers my wine taste and occasionally texted to inform me the good bargain of my favorite wine. Thanks again and looking forward to many more purchase from your outlet.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108328591530559203683/reviews
