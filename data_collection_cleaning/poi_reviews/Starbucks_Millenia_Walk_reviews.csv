Thomas Timlen,5,"So cool...

At my desk on the 17th floor of Centennial Tower I use the Starbucks app to order a coffee. Then I go down to collect it. I see an empty seat and as soon as I sit down the barista calls my name!

And as it was the first time I used the app I got 50% off!

This location was also recently renovated so it's got nice chairs etc",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102162456131009361077/reviews
Charles Leo,5,"The food and drinks are the same in any of the Starbucks branches, but it's the service and the people that makes this a 5 star experience every time. I come here quite often and it didn't take Leon very long to not only remember me, my favourite drink but also my name!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103511987696178063669/reviews
Theresa H,5,"Staffs here were the nicest among the many sbuxs I had been in Singapore. They were always friendly and made the drinks right. Location was really calm and quiet in the mornings. Most importantly, the place was always clean! Perhaps need some signs to ask the patrons to clean up the table after eating/drinking. Cleaning after people is not any baristaâ€™s job.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103077620103588076248/reviews

Thanks to the night staff
