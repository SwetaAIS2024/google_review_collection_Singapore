The other dishes were good but nothing to die for, just comfort food at affordable prices. Convenient for people around the area but would not travel out of the way to have this.\n\nService was good and people were friendly.",

Egg omelette & seafood bitter-gourd soup was very tasty.  All in, a very filling meal, just a tad salty for me but just right for my uncle & auntie.  Quite crowded for a Sunday dinner at 5:40pm",
