Jorn Haron,5,"I had a great experience at this shop! One of the Chinese cashiers was extremely helpful, and all the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The most important thing the shop is super clean, which I really appreciate!

Also, one staff member even said my wife looks like an Indonesian artist, hahaha such a funny and sweet moment! Thank you for the excellent service. Keep up the great work!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114284222790104146634/reviews

The sliced beef is quite tough... The prawns are very fresh.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108162573534379210997/reviews
Myra Z.,4,"Went on weekend at 9pm, alot of free parkings, restaurant was already alot of people so it's best to book before you come. We were lucky there were available spots since we only came for 2 pax.

The table is spacious, clean space, alot of people but you can still move around. Staffs are very friendly, gave us a quick explanation on how to order (since it's our first time) and even offered to change the oil sheet when it's already burnt.

You can order their slices through QR code or just take the unlimited marinated meat/chicken/fish at the freezer. There's also cordial and boxed drinks. Some malay dishes too, kuihs and ICE CREAM STICKS LOVE IT

TBH, I don't know if it was unfortunate for us or what but the sliced beef are so chewy :// even if we grilled/boiled it to well done or medium rare, it is still chewy and tasteless. But the marinated meats are very nice tho. Maybe this is something the restaurant can look into..

Other than that, we enjoyed the meal overall.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111226404280266639426/reviews
