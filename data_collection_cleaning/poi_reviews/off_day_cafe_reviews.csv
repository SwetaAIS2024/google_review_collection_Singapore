Sherry L,5,"Randomly chanced upon this caf√© on a Saturday morning for brunch. Looks like they‚Äôve updated and revamped their menu compared to the older reviews. We tried the English Breakfast and Strawberry Bubble Waffle ‚Äî both were delicious! Their other desserts also looked really cute and tempting.

Do support this lovely place!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108654658519470782218/reviews
Cheryl Teo,4,"Lovely, tranquil cafe. Food was tasty and portions were pretty big. Very interesting and creative menu too!

Tried the Hainanese chicken risotto which was really good! Lots of textures and flavour in the dish. If there‚Äôs any feedback, it‚Äôll only be that it was slightly on the saltier side. But still yummy nonetheless!

OD breakfast was HUGE and delicious. Hash brown was cooked nice and crispy! Again, food was on the saltier side but it might just be a personal preference.

Shashouka‚Äôs taste and visual was more towards a thicker version of minestrone soup.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110378852866450366882/reviews
Fatdieme,4,"Vibey cafe to chill and yap. Saw a meow meow and that was my highlight ‚ù§Ô∏è hope more people can bring their pets üòå
Am only rating the deserts. The strawberry egglet looks good and that's it. For the price point, I would have expected better quality cream and more strawberries. Egglet was crispy but it lacked aroma and taste.

Tiramisu slaps. Cream was light, not overtly sweet and hint of savoury (from the Mascarpone), coffee was good. Texture can be better if they can consider layering the cake with a bit more cream in between.

Coffee is decent.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102099818090750573208/reviews
Kartheeni Nair,4,"Everything that we ordered, personally no complaints. They were all pretty good. The burnt cheesecake was unexpectedly good. We enjoyed the avocado bagel, please kindly try it if you plan to eat there. The matcha was just nice. However, we felt that the service was lacking a bit. Example, they forgot to serve us the burnt cheesecake until we reminded them. Hopefully the service is better the next time we go. Environment is pretty chill. You can definitely get some work done here.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116017556264180643374/reviews
Daniel Goh,5,"Our second visit at off day cafe and we‚Äôre glad to see that the food‚Äôs still as good. Ambience was 5/5 though service was a little off.

We ordered the cream pasta with turkey bacon bits, sinful bagel, caesar salad and strawberry waffles - enjoyed every dish which was served piping hot. Between the Black Forest cake and the burnt cheesecake we much enjoyed the latter.

They offered a special latte for Christmas and it was one of the better coffees I‚Äôve had.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117197111812506610741/reviews
