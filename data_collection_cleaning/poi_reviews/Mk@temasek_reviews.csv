Bulbous Areola,3,"New facilities, estb in 2023. However, lacked covered walk way linking main gate to Mk. No vehicle pick drop off or pick up point. Parent drivers have to park at MSCP , walk a good 500m (no shelter) and climb up 3 stories to pick up children. Then take another long walk out to gate and back to MSCP for a good 10 minutes. Hope drop off and pick up can be improve for the next batch of MK.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113518993638468950812/reviews
