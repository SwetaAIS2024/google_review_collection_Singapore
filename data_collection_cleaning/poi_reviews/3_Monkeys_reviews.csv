Michelin Inspector,5,"I had the seaweed chicken cutlet here which came with 2 sides which I chose fries and furikake rice with onsen egg. At only 16.50 for the entire set, I would say this set was a steal. The staff was accommodating to our request. I will return back! This restaurant is right in front of the bus stop hence its super convenient.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108167496990200967081/reviews
YYS,5,Chanced upon on Google maps while looking for late dinner place. Honestly the food quality were way above expectations. Portions were generous and price is totally fair. We will totally visit again! Probably more patrons from the neighborhood but I feel the traffic could be better if there are better entertainment especially on weekends! Maybe a live band or ktv system?☺️,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112384904219370054165/reviews
Sera // IG: diningwithsera,4,"unexpected but pleasant find !

We had their 3 monkeys chicken ($14), pepperoni pizza ($15) and seaweed fries ($10). Would recommend trying their pizza which was thin crusted and well seasoned, and chicken which was tender and mildly spicy (very shiok).

Friendly staff + cool toilet / interior decor haha",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118301436723641326928/reviews
