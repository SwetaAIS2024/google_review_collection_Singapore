Also noticed that the coffee is now priced at $1.50 ‚Äî a bit on the higher side for a simple coffee shop setting. I appreciate the atmosphere, but I hope the quality and pricing can be revisited.\n\nBtw I am from the neighborhood.",

      "text": "TOTALLY AWFUL EXPERIENCE!!! üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª\n\nVisited on 19 Mar for breakfast w/ my family of 3. Due to comfort reasons, my 2 yo child prefers to sit on an (adult) chair instead of a child seat.\n\nHalfway through our meal, the staff informed that we need to sit separately, I complied as the staff were strictly following instructions (from my conversation w/ 2 aunties, they claimed that they're instructed by the boss).\n\nI also saw a similar situation where 3 young patrons were asked to sit separately when one of them was pulling a chair to the table. Kudos on the good enforcement efforts by the (strictly following instructions) auntie.\n\nWhile leaving, I saw a similar sitting arrangement w/ a family of 3 but NOTHING was done by the staff.\n\nDue to my unpleasant experience of facing double standards & selective scrutiny, I went to raise my case to a staff of such malpractice.\n\nSadly, the reason I was given was \"I don't know which staff told you to sit separately\". I then asked the auntie if the family would need to wait for the (enforcer) staff to appear?!?! as the \"boss's instructions\" were clear as daylight. After saying my piece, I left as not wanting to make a scene as the aunties can't and doesn't want to react to (individual) situations than follow a scripted guide of the \"boss's instructions\".\n\nI've always liked the coffee at this joint but after today's experience I'm adamant that today's bitter aftertaste would stay for a very long time.\n\nIf our cravings for dim does arises, I'm pretty sure this would no longer be our preferred  choice.",
