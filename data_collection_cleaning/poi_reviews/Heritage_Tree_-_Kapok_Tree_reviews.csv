Adam Lee,5,"Heritage Tree - Kapok Tree

The Heritage Tree Scheme, announced on 17 August 2001, advocates the conservation of Singaporeâ€™s mature trees. In support of this initiative, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) established the Heritage Trees Fund then to kick-start a conservation programme that safeguards and promotes appreciation of our natural heritage. The programme now includes initiatives such as the installation of lightning conductors, interpretive signage and the setting up of a nomination scheme for the community.

This scheme is open to the public. Anyone can submit an online Heritage Tree nomination form, recommending a tree to be endorsed as a Heritage Tree. Nominations for the 2019 Heritage Tree Scheme cycle must be received by 15 July 2019. Nominations received after this date will be considered for the 2020 cycle.

The list of nominated trees will be inspected by NParks arborists before it is submitted to the Heritage Tree Panel. The Panel will ultimately decide if the nominated trees are suitable to be endorsed as Heritage Trees.

Qualifying criteria for a tree to be endorsed as a Heritage Tree includes:
A girth (trunk circumference) of more than five metres; and/or
botanical, social, historical, cultural and/or aesthetical value.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115680102960193169110/reviews
