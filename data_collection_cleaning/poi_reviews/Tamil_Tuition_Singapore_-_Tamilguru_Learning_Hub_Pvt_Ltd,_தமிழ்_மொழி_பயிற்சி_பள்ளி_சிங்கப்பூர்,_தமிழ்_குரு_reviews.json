Her lesson plan is tailored to best suit the students need. This helps to enhance the knowledge, builds their confidence and brings out the best performance. Within one year we were able to appreciate the improvement in our child's (Sec 3) grade and attitude towards the subject. We received regular feed back about his progress and suggestions to improve. The books written by Mdm Sakthi helped our child with his exam prep. Would definitely recommend.",
