I suffered from endless 24/7 pain and frequent tears. Dr Darren Phua treated me, he is a very compassionate and knowledgeable doctor and after 1year he performed a RF nerve surgery on me as I was badly affected by this injury. His surgical skill is very good, and he has the ability to free people from prisons of pain. I am very grateful. God bless him and his family.",

      "text": "I want to thank Dr Thor Timothy so much from Novena Pain Management Centre. He is a very caring, kind and generous doctor. I've been to numerous doctors, TCM & Chiropractors for the past 2 years and none solved my nerve pain issues that I have been suffering a great deal. After visiting Dr Thor he reviewed my pain and gave me an injection. After 3 days the pain was gone by 50%! I was thrilled and went on for the 2nd & 3rd injection and to my surprise my pian was 90% gone! I was so over the moon. I can work properly again and live my life again. Thank you so much Dr Thor. You are really amazing and awesome!",

      "text": "I'd like to thank Dr Choo for managing my headaches and migraines for the past 5 years. Prior to meeting dr Choo, I suffered mercilessly under these diseases as I am allergic to most pain killers. Dr Choo did a cervical ablation for me and that elevated my migraine by 90%. Besides being a skillful and experienced doctor, Dr Choo is very kind and helpful in my season of need. I really am very thankful to him for all his kindness, wisdom in tweaking my drug administration to help me manage my pain and for all the things that he has gone above and beyond as a doctor to become a friend and trusted advisor. I do highly recommend Dr Choo should anyone need any help in His areas of expertise. Thanks Dr Choo. And words are never enough to express my gratitude for all these years of help you have rendered to me. May the Lord bless you ever so richly that your barns are not enough to hold in the blessings poured forth. Amen!!",
