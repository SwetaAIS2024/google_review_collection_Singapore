tan lee,5,"Dropped by during Good Friday to pick up 3 Koi.  Thanks Johnny for helping me to choose 2 Showa and 1 Shiro.  Since my requirement is a koi that will slowly develop to its full potential, instead of one that is full developed.  That will make keeping koi more interesting....",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112909697961260053688/reviews
Boon Chan,5,Visited Marugen back in August after a very bad experience with another farm. All 7 koi‚Äôs died after being infected by 2 new fish from this other farm. Fergus was very thorough in explaining the issue and helped me step by step restoring my pond and introducing new fish that I bought from him. Picture attached shows how big the fish has grown in 6 months. Fergus is still helping me whenever I have questions about water quality or feed. Truly above and beyond service that I seldom see in other shops.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116542371697632687933/reviews
