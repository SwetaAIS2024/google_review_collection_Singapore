      "text": "Saw this recommendation thru IG app hence proceed to try over a weekend brunch time. The crowd fits up fast once past 12noon. Fully seated. The only downside is that parking can be a challenge. Limited. Place decently renovated, got beach hut feel. Normal customer service. I like the menu, good variety of food choices. I like the meat platter option, mix and match style. We like most of the meat we ordered, well marinated and meat is tender. The weight of the meat is stated too, helps to gauge how the amount that you wanna eat. The mushroom soup is very creamy, it is more a creamy dish than soup. Free drinking water which is nice gesture. My family likes the food, look at the empty plates. Overall a good find, i will definitely come back for other options.",

      "text": "Food here is decent, but their prices are amazing. Their value proposition makes every things tastes better. They are definitely a neighbourhood type establishment and a little bit out of the way. But if you want good home style American bbq that doesn't break the bank, then I'd have to recommend this place. Best to share so everyone can try a bit of everything!",

We had to wait 15mins for a table but the waiters offered us drinks at the bar while waiting. Love the tater tots, the burgers, fish and chips, pasta.. Which is about everything we ordered. Will be back when we are around the area",

      "text": "Had a very bad experience at Bernie's. Visited on a Friday and put in my order at about 710pm. We noticed that there was no food coming out from the kitchen for a good 45 mins and we queried the staff. Staff told us that they had a system issue so the orders did not go through.\n\nI thought this was a joke as I would expect the floor manager to be aware of his orders.\n\nOur food finally came at 810/815pm just when I wanted to walk off. I was served cold mac and cheese, overly dry brisket (I know how to cook it so I know how it works), very well done lamb chops instead of medium ones, and unseasoned beef Ribeye that was pretty cold already but doneness was about right. Fries were fine. I guess they were trying to mass cook the meat after realising the issue, but this is not acceptable.\n\nCrew attempted a bit of service recovery by serving free mushroom soup and some mushroom side dish but my wife has mushroom allergy.\n\nIt is very unfortunate as I wanted to head to Mongkok Dimsum for a good meal but we decided to give Bernie's a try and it resulted in a very bad Friday night",
