They welcome children from all backgrounds, and the curriculum, which includes Islamic subjects and a pre-madrasah entry program, is fantastic.\n\nA special shoutout to the supportive staff and to every single teacher.. and also to Teacher Sarah for her exceptional kindness and patience. She's always polite and loving, even in tough situations. She goes above and beyond to ensure our child's comfort, safety, and happiness.\n\nTeacher Sarah's dedication is the main reason we've chosen to stay here, despite considering another centre closer to home. The positive changes in our child's development under her care are truly remarkable.",
