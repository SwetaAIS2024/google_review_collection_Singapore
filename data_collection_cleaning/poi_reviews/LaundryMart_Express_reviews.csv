Will Lew,5,"Easy enough to use. The machines come with detergent and if you opt to pay a little more, there's softener too.

Dryer was a little confusing as there was a low, medium and high setting. Tried medium for 25 mins and my clothes were still a little damp*. An additional 10 mins of high temperature did the trick though I could have just use the high temp setting for 15 or 20 mins I think. So far no shrinkages.

If you change dollars to coins, there will be tokens, so plan ahead on the amount you might need.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100936041992935416327/reviews
