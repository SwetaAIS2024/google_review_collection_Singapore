      "text": "Call the young boss to check the price of swapping the tyres of 2 cars. He quote me $60 for swapping the wheels and $80 for swapping the tyres. So i went down to the shop the next day to swap and told him i decide to swap the tyres. Young boss ask me how much he quote me, and i told him the price. He says cannot be as he needs to change 8 tyres and asked for $120. I show him my phone with the phone call record and he says he cannot be quoting me that price. My friend near by says that there is no point to swap for $120 as my exisiting tyres still have 30-40 percent. I could not help as their fast hand workers already start swapping. Last he say 人在做，天在看，and reluctantly accept the $80 job. I told him that he need not make such comments, i am no con man. I had changed my tyres at his shop before as a returning customer. Honestly, i would not make the trip for a $120 swap. disappointed with the way he dealt with this biz deal, i will not go back again.",

      "text": "I had a punctured front left tyre n had to replace two tyres for $340 (excluding $50 to tow my car) on the 6th Aug 24. On the 27th Dec 24 my hubby sent our car for servicing and my hubby realised the two front tyres were already bald. So I'm not certain if TS Auto actually replaced new tyres as they only lasted about 4 months. Anyway I'm certainly not going there anymore.",
