Lisa T,3,I chose egg mayo thinking it will not go wrong since it’s a classic flavor. Eggs was not well seasoned. Unless they were hoping the pork floss sprinkles will help to replace the seasoning. The sweetness from pork floss did help a little but a pinch of salt will lift the overall flavor profile better. I don’t eat salty food but I expect some minimal seasoning. Bread was toasty and good portion of egg. Just fell short on seasoning.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101998729191684176802/reviews
Lixuan G,2,"Just a PSA, $1.95 promo not stated that it doesn’t apply when getting the buy 3 free 1 deal. Even tho I got 2 of the $1.95 flavour.

Not that I really care about the 25 cents discount. But it would be nice to be more transparent about the pricing w customers and not having to have to ask about it after toast has been heated and money is paid.

Receipt wasn’t even given after payment.

Also, paying $2-$4 for a quarter of a sandwich was also pretty hefty imo.

Will I be back probably not, but if you’re looking for a snack and a variety, it’d probably work",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109505902361276184915/reviews
Shermaine Lim,5,"i bought home & reheat w my air fryer. my favourites are the avocado, cheesy bakwa and the chilli crab. i don’t even normally like avocado but somehow their avocado doesn’t have that smell to it and it’s rlly yummy. they put a lot of filling, so the price is not too bad esp when they have their 1.95 promos",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106911698401190090108/reviews
