Additionally, the eggs lacked their natural fragrance.\nOn a positive note, the firm rice was excellent, and it would have paired perfectly with curry - unfortunately, they don't offer it ðŸ˜….\nThe Staff, however, were very friendly.",

      "text": "Chicken Cutlet Egg Rice for $7. Chicken cutlet was marinated in prawn paste, which was unexpected and pretty good. Egg had a strong buttery taste but ultimately was just so-so. If I returned, would ask for less sauce as I thought the rice was a little too soggy for my liking. Don't forget the chilli! Pay with the Fairprice app to get 10% off too.",
