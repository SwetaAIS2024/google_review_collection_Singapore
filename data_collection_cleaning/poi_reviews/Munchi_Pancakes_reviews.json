      "text": "A pancake store which sells traditional and modern pancakes. Love their fragrant peanut sauce instead of old style peanut which tends to fall out when biting. Each bite is full of crunchy peanut sauce filling.\n\nI Started with their modern filling pancake though and they had various flavours cheese and encased in 2 round pancake.\n\nLove each and every of them so far. But it can be a long wait if they run out of the skin. So order in advance before buying other stuff.",
