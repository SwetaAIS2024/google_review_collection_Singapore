Was issued hydrocortisone steroid cream for eye eczema only to learn that steroids should NOT be applied around the eyes by other clinic. I was told that it could pose risks to my eyes such as cataracts in the long run.\n\nNot only did I not recover from my condition for a month, but was issued something detrimental to my eyes instead?  ðŸ˜‚ do not recommend",

Never had I come across such a condescending and dismissive doctor - if you lack compassion or patience, you are clearly in the wrong profession.  Not to mention she was using her phone during the consultation, on my time - show some basic respect to your patients.",
