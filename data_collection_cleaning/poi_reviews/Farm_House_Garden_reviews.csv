Neo,4,"Went Tokyo Taste, ordered chicken katsu omucurry don and Park and Salmon Sumiyaki don. The curry taste good, they torch the salmon n pork well.

Mantou,3,"Nice environment, ordered from the Chicken rice store. The accompanying soup not bad, the rice ok. The chicken tender but a little lack flavor.

Otherwise ok.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118213126945726447138/reviews
