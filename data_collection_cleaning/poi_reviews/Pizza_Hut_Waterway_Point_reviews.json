Recommend to give it a try .\n\nThank you to all the  friendly staffs in Waterway Point branch ! Bravo!",

      "text": "Definitely a great place to eat due to the delicious food and great service. The female Malay staff informed us to sign up with our email account so we can get rewards after we ordered our food. Most times we would have just go without registering if we weren‚Äôt sure to visit again or not. We claimed a complimentary garlic bread.\n\nAfter our order has been confirmed, Sanjay (male staff) informed us of the survey to do to get another freebie. He assisted us and we got another complimentary garlic bread (we are fans of Pizza Hut garlic bread since we were teenagers). He even helped us take photos (coz most times we either too shy to ask or just don‚Äôt want to bother the staff). Very friendly staff, he made us feel like this is the restaurant to go to.\n\nThe affordable pricing compared to some restaurants made us want to plan a family gathering next time. If they allow reservations for large group.\n\nWould definitely come back to this branch Waterway Point! Mainly due to the staff and food. Love the curry chicken pizza and the garlic bread!",
