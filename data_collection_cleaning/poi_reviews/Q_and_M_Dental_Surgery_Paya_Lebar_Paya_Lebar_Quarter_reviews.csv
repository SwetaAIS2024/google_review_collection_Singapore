mohseena khan,1,"The first ever dentist who cannot tell the overall condition of my teeth without an xray. Kept insisting on an xray when I told her I don't need it. I'm just there for general cleaning and polishing. When I asked about how my teeth were looking overall, she said I can't tell without an xray. All the dentists that I been to were able to give me some good advise. You can tell that the dentist just wanted me to spend more on unnecessary xrays.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111671153543010154736/reviews

Aly Is,5,"I had my temp crown broken into pieces while waiting for my perm crown, not once but twice! üò¨ I called Q and M Paya Lebar for help to get the temp crown fixed and both times I've been treated so professionally and kindly by Dr Jessica and her assistant, and to Mary at the reception for all their kindness and understanding. They helped fit me in for emergency appointment even with their tight schedule, I'm so touched with the level of service. Keep it up ladies!! ‚ô•Ô∏è",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112029373455518357901/reviews
