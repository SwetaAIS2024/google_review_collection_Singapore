Have visited for years and seen Doc Lim since he took over from the previous doctor.\n\nThe counter staff are all very nice also especially one of the short hair lady. They know all of their regulars well, sometimes they may seem to be more fierce with the customers but those are actually customers they know and you have to be more firm with them.\n\nThe charges are reasonable which is why many people visit and thus making the waiting time long. Used to accept only cash but they are ok for you to pay the balance on another day if you are a bit short but recently seems to include other form of payment.\n\nA small and simple clinic but professional and got ‰∫∫ÊÉÖÂë≥.",
