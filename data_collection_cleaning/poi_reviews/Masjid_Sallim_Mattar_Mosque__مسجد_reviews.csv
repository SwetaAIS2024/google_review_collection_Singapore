Amar Koul,5,"Alhamdullilah. It is a nice & well-maintained mosque within the Macpherson residential area. Prayer hall can accommodate 50 congregants per level in accordance to SafeEntry regulations. Parking is a little difficult so for drivers, please search for parking at ‚Äú8 Tanner Road, HYFA‚Äù and it is a 4-minute walk from there.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100276120372481396557/reviews
Muhammad Suhayl Suhaimi,5,"Very friendly volunteers/staffs managing the mosque, signages are clear and well-maintained facilities and toilets. Ventilation needs to be improved as it was quite hot and stuffy despite the fans (the max speed was quite slow). I strongly suggest switching on the air-conditioning during Friday prayers to enhance the comfort level.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109052256569593596165/reviews
