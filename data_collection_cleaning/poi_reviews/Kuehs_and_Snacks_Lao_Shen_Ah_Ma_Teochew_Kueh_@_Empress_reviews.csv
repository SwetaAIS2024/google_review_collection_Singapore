Merryheart,4,"Nostalgic traditional Teochew kueh at Bukit Merah. My favourite is the Jiucai kueh (Èü≠ËèúÁ≤øÔºâÔºå various kinds of Ang ku kueh, Èº†Â£≥Á≤øÔºåreal bamboo shoot kueh (Á¨ãÁ≤ø), mang Kuang kueh (turnips kueh).  There is another stall called Poh Chieu nearby which is more commercialised with translucent & thinner dough.  However, the old uncle at Lao Sim Ah Mah Kueh has been selling these kueh‚Äôs for decades and it gives a home coming feeling as he speaks Teochew to his customers. üíï",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101391398296811227556/reviews
CK C,5,The tapioca kueh ($4) was amazingly soft. This looks like a branch of a stall with the same name in Alexandra Village.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Beryl Saw,2,"Honestly not good. I know there are many loyal fans out there sorry. Bought 4 flavours of ang ku kueh (bean, peanut, sesame, yam) and how is it that all of them- skin too thick, feels like it was kept for a few days already, and the filling were all bland and lacklustre. Bean, yam and sesame all roughly tasted the same. And the peanut tasted ÊºèÈ£é. $1.30/piece

Bought the mini ku chai kueh too, again the skin was so thick that we felt that we ate more skin than filling. ÔºÑ6.50 for 6 mini pieces.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101109786288232850962/reviews

Shaolin Leong,4,"Traditional kuehs ! ‚Äã‚ÄãMy daughter's favorite Ang Ku Kueh stall ! Especially their peanuts & durians . Hardworking & friendly owner . Absolutely authentic & traditional hand made .So many different types to choose from. Must try and support if not all these traditional food & skills of making them will be lost ! Closed on Monday & Thursday.
Kung Fu skills! I hope not to be eliminated by this ruthless and indifferent high-tech era and the fate of no successors! We must pass it on!
Come on!
Closed from 27th January 2025 for Chinese New Year!
