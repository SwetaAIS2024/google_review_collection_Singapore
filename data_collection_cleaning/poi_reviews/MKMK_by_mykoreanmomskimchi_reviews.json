      "text": "First time eating here!\n\nI don‚Äôt know if I was hungry or what, but the kimchi was legit the best kimchi I‚Äôve eaten in Singapore. Very UMAMI. I finished the bowl before my bimbimbap came out which they graciously refilled. I am the number 1 fan of this kimchi ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nBeef bulgolgi in the bimbimbap was well seasoned. Not fatty if you are health conscious, but if you like fatty kind this is not it. The bimbimbap came with many types of veggies so it was very satisfying and the rice is the purple kind. I love veggies!!! ü•í I also ordered gimbap, which is yummy as well and I would 10/10 order again as it was literally 1:1 replica of how they would serve it in Korea.\n\nService was great and the vibe was nice with the wallpaper of the Hanok in Seoul. The aunty was very friendly and greeted me when I was ordering food. I‚Äôm socially awkward but felt welcome. The waiter was very polite too! I will definitely come back again with more friends and try their soups which look fire on the menu.\n\nThe only one improvement I would make is: if the bimbimbap can be with ‚Äûhot stone‚Äú, it would be awesome (maybe as an option?) That being said, when it‚Äôs not in hot stone, very shiok to eat it fast without being scared of burning my mouth so I‚Äôm fine either way!",

      "text": "Visited at 6pm on a rainy Sunday evening. Not a very big place and only 2 tables were occupied before us. Halfway into dinner, the place was a full house with some takeaway queue outside. Ordered a drink, noodles soup, rice with some stew, BBQ Chicken and Kimchi Pancake. Kimchi came first. BEST KIMCHI as far as we can remember. Food quality was excellent, except that the pancake was a little wet/softer than we would like. Service lady evidently of Korean ethnicity spoke with a little Singlish slang, provided excellent service. Interesting Table #1 feature for ordering and gaming - check it out. Music was nice but a little too loud for a relaxing family conversation. Left with full stomachs with five items plus a drink for four persons - costed SGD85.",
