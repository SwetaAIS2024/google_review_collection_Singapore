We are very satisfied with the initial discussion with Ron personally, updates on the progress and the final delivery timelines. Our art pieces always look elevated and timeless after the framings. We often get many compliments from our friends and guests at our house. We truly recommend them for your well loved art pieces.",

From intending to frame 2 artwork in our first visit to returning multiple times to frame more artwork and photos! It was truly enjoyable going through the artwork and hearing Ron's proposals of how different frames would bring out different effects of the artwork. Thank you very much! We will definitely be back again!",

Ron is very patient and professional in providing many suggestions which helped me in my final choice of frames. I have ended up getting him to frame two items. While the cost is not cheap, but it’s the overall service and end products that satisfied your soul :)",
