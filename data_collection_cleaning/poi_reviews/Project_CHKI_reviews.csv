krish hehe,5,"had my 18th birthday here at R7 for three hours! wouldâ€™ve extended if i had started earlier haha. super fun, everyone enjoyed it. photobooth area was well lit with all deco provided. no cutlery so would suggest to bring your own! car sim and karaoke was an absolute hit with my friends. rooftop area for hot girl pics + they had electric mahjong!! we loved playing that and the plenty board games. can connect to bluetooth speaker to play music and has a mic to sing along. complimentary snacks and drinks (even beer??). their stairs itself are a vibe!! had a blast, would def come again to experience EXP.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114940766328693228874/reviews

JustChristabelle,4,"Venue is great for small groups of up to 30 pax indoors and maybe 50 pax outdoors. We booked for the rooftop L7 and I thought it was an affordable and nice place to celebrate any occasion. The rooftop is vibey and aesthetic at night and I heard you can even do bbq during the day.

On the other hand, the karaoke room needs a lil cleaning and so does the toilet. The service team could be a little bit more responsive but all in all its good.

Big thanks to Isaac for helping with the setup of the venue!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111322313924942930801/reviews
Naael Mufti,5,"Booked the Roof7 for my girlfriend's birthday party. Amazing experience, the facility was great, the rooftop was amazing especially with the sunset. Great supplies and entertainment options (racing sim, karaoke, board games, ps4, poker table, mahjong etc.), it even came with some snacks and drinks and a lot of decorations that were set up before hand.

The 2 staff James and Nicole also helped us clean up at the end and were extremely helpful throughout the booking. Overall 10/10 I will 100% be booking back with them another time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103934106590413318846/reviews
