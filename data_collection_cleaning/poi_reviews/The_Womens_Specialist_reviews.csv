T Teo,5,"Called in for a last minute appointment and the nurse was kind and patient with my query over the phone, doctor Chandra was very kind, patient and assuring with all our concerns and took his time to explain the options thoroughly without rushing the process. We felt like we could make better informed decisions after hearing from him.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117286008284614373951/reviews
sh1zuku,2,One of the best clinic iâ€™ve ever visited so far ðŸ¥¹ Dr Chandra was so patient & caring and he would explain everything to you. The frontliners was also nice. Update review: True they were nice but i once called them to make an appointment and this lady was super rude. Two of them actually. Super super rude. Donâ€™t work as a frontliner if you canâ€™t respect & be nice.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103301105456708017978/reviews
N Tan,5,"long overdued review for DrDenas and team, my go-to urgent gynae since a teenager and fast forward on it's been 2 decades and my 3rd pregnancy.
the recept team are always accommodating to my urgent last min appointment whenever I'm not feeling well. DrDenas is always so calm, welcoming and reassuring, providing sound advices and although he doesnt deliver my babies (as he's not based at my usual hospital), his diagnosis and scans are always very accurate.
grateful to have him and the team around in this neighbourhood :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101863805500571986031/reviews
DC DC,5,I had Dr Denas for my daughter 12 years ago. Just went back for a check up and he is still as calming and assuring as ever. Much better than the other gynaecologists i had seen.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105478808027994401830/reviews
