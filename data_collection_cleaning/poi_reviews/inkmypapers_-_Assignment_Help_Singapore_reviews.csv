Sebastian,4,"Have used their proofreading services for a personal project I was working on, and they went on to do more than proofreading - gave me additional insights and tips for me to better express what I want to write. Though the article may never be published ever (it's a personal project), I've gained insights for writing that I never thought I'd get.

It's a little expensive for proofreading, but get the complete editing with the comments (the 2nd option, not too sure what their name is) if you want the full value. For a Singaporean service, not too bad.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113445372014641675255/reviews
Destiny Star,5,"Their services are top-notch and 100% provide high quality papers. Giving them the necessary files and answering their queries are the most important as it determine your grades. You guys might find it expensive for their services but with a guarantee Bs or As grade, I rather why not spent this money, instead of hiring some garbage service from Carousell, HAHAHA.

I can guarantee they are really good as I have been with them more than a year already and I have recommended them to some of my colleagues where they also find them very professional and discreet.

So just go ahead and contact them if u want a Bs or As.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103378620109418298165/reviews
