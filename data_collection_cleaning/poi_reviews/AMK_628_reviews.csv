LP Pua,3,"Went on a Sunday morning.  A few stalls have long queues, and this was one of them. It sells traditional breakfast food like glutinous rice, chew cheong fun, yam cake and chee kway, which we bought. Food was average, and there was nothing spectacular for us to do a return visit.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
William Lu,4,"Bought cheong fun, tapioca cakes, and one more cakes (I don't know the name cause it is Chinese, I just pointed the picture). I like the cheong fun. It was good and sweet. Tapioca cakes wasn't that good. I was eating from the plastic directly and smelled kind of vinegar smell. Didn't really like it. The cake was good but the ingredients was not enough for the entire cakes. It was tasteless without it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
