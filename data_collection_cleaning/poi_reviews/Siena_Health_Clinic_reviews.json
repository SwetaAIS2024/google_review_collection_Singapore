No waste of time in waiting.\n\nI have decided to add on comment here. I was told by the clinic assistant that I would receive the medication in 1-3 working days, but today is already the 3rd working day, plus the 2 weekend days, total 5 days, i still yet to receive despite payment done almost immediately after consultation 5 days ago.",

My friend recommended me a clinic, but itâ€™s quite far from my place. A monthly visit to that clinic is a hassle for me. Good thing I found Sienna Health Clinic. Registration and online consultation was very smooth. Plus they will deliver the medicine right at my doorstep for free!\nThank you Sienna Health!",
