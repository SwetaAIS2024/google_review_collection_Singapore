mark lawrence medrano,5,"The gallery is quite hard to find. Its on the 4th flloor of the Amoy Street Food Center (hawker). So make sure to find the elevator lobby.

Very informative and inclusive. Would definitely recommend you to visit this gallery. You could easily finish touring this place in less than an hour. If you come with a large group, pre-booking I would say, is necessary.

The gallery staff/manager were very eager to show you around. Good job everyone!!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116596634421121249983/reviews
Samuel Swee,5,"I really enjoyed the exhibits here. Stumbled upon the signage as I was leaving the hawker centre. This gallery while talking about diversity, focuses on diversity in terms of religion. The gallery starts off with a 3 minute video showing the numerous religious conflicts around the world. Thereafter, there is a poll about religious diversity in Singapore. The gallery is split up into four sections. I found the section on common areas across 10 religions to be extremely informative, but a bit exhausting to read. I liked the postal game from another section, which had scenarios to which the player could react to. The final section lets you make a pledge, which can appear on a digital tree, or you can hang a written pledge up.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117269474701481579934/reviews

Arthur Cheng,5,"Itâ€™s is small but nice museum or gallery where share about the harmony society is important and the staff at the gallery is also very friend. Location is indeed not easy to find. Walk in to the hawker center and looking for atm machine and there is a door with annexes b, walk in and take lift to 04 floor.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113086205836216071615/reviews
Jordan M.,5,"Free entry. We saw the sign outside the hawker centre but it was a little confusing how to get to this place. At the edge of the hawker centre near the DBS ATM look for a door that says ""Annexe B"" and take the elevator to the 4th floor.

Good exhibits to help one understand how important racial/ethnic harmony is to be fabric of Singapore.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105932758119166490565/reviews
