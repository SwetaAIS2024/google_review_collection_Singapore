GG K,2,"This review is based off their desserts solely, not too sure how their mains will fare. In general, I would recommend avoiding their desserts completely as they miss the mark by quite a lot.

We tried the mango passion fruit entremet (sourced from Patisserie Cle if I remember correctly) and the Cheesecake. Both were really disappointing, they tasted way too sweet. The mango passion fruit entremet in particular lacked complexity and tasted kind of artificial. As for the drinks, the coffee and hot chocolate were average, but nothing special.

Overall, I would not recommend this place for afternoon tea. Prices are quite high as well which is completely not worth the quality you're getting. Somehow, the business here is pretty good, so it's also not easy to get a table even on a weekday (and definitely not worth the wait).",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113182488876013163119/reviews
Michele Yap,5,"We had a delightful dinner with excellent service by our server, Ling.

The portions were very generous for the Sesame Tuna Tataki and also their signature Garlic Prawn & Avocado Sourdough Flatbread, which was yums! This is coming from a non-veggie eater.

On the contrary, the cheese board had only 2 types of cheeses, hardly a cheese board… it could have been more generous with at least 3 types.

Lovely chill ambience, will definitely be back again!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111170749139953218592/reviews
Yu Quan Yeo,5,"Little Farms is a gem for fresh, high-quality food that highlights the natural flavours of its ingredients. Their Spiced Cauliflower is a one of my favourite dishes, with perfectly cooked cauliflower complemented by yoghurt, pomegranate, and flavourful sauces that create a delightful harmony on the palate.

Another must-try is the Avocado Quinoa Feta Bowl, an excellent blend of savoury and sweet elements with a refreshing touch of acidity. It's a satisfying and wholesome meal that never disappoints.

The café also boasts a tempting selection of pastries and beverages, making it an ideal spot for a quick snack or leisurely meal. Little Farms consistently delivers a great dining experience for those who appreciate simple yet flavourful food.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109504835113397432635/reviews
Jean VB,5,"Super fresh healthy food choices. Great portions and worth every penny. Did a little food shopping in their diverse market after dinner. We had the mushroom beef pasta, caesar salad, and broccoli. Excellent and plenty for two.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116915504065255507954/reviews
