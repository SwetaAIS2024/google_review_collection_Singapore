The char siew was sliced so thinly and in small pieces. The wanton soup was ok it didnt taste like alot of msg which is good.\n\nLikely not to return.",

Totally missed the chewy noodle and char siew still taste fantastic. My verdict? Tanjung Rhu or not, as long it is nice and reasonably priced, itâ€™s just a delicious Wanton Me to me.",
