      "text": "A Five-Star Experience at Paiza Sky Residences, Marina Bay Sands\n\nI recently had the privilege of dining at Paiza Sky Residences at Marina Bay Sands, and I was blown away by the impeccable service and attention to detail. Two standout staff made exceptionally memorable: Wayne and Anthony.\n\nWayne provided outstanding service during the afternoon tea session. His attentiveness, professionalism, and warm demeanor truly set the tone for the day. He ensured everything was perfect, particularly his thoughtful recommendations on the menu. Wayne’s ability to anticipate my needs and his genuine hospitality elevated the entire afternoon tea experience.\n\nIn the evening, Anthony took over and delivered equally remarkable service during the evening dinner. His friendly approach, coupled with his efficiency, made the experience seamless and enjoyable. Anthony was attentive to every detail, ensuring my champagne and wine was always filled.\n\nSpeaking of the spread, the evening spread was nothing short of exquisite! A fine selection of flavours and textures that showcased the premium ingredients used at Sky Residences.\n\nWith such an exceptional team (Audrey, Stella, so many others!) and incredible dining offerings, Paiza Sky Residences redefines hospitality in Singapore. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a truly luxurious experience at Marina Bay Sands.",
