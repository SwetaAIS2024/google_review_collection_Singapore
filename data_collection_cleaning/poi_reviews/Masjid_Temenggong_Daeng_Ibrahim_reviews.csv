Zahari Nawi,5,"One of many unique mosques in SG. The mosque and its adjacent Johor Royal Mausoleum and Tanah Kubor Temenggong Johor are owned by the State of Johor for the Sultan of Johor. It is one of two mosques in the country, not under the purview of MUIS.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101847246619607795969/reviews

Amar Koul,5,"Alhamdullilah. Prayers at this masjid is always so pleasant. The prayer hall inside is large, airy and really comfortable to pray in. The sound system is also very effective so it adds another dimension to the overall experience. There are lots of volunteers so you really feel like this is a close-knit community who runs the operations here. This masjid is unique - it is operated by MUIS but is owned by the Johor state government.

Centrally located, it is a stoneâ€™s throw away from HarbourFront MRT. For drivers, it is recommended to get there early as parking inside is limited - the nearest after that would be at Seah Im Food Centre.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100276120372481396557/reviews

Aditya Prabowo,5,"Beautiful Masjid with strategic location on Telok Blangah road, beside the Bay Hotel and in front of Vivo City.
The Masjid is so clean and I felt so peaceful when I was praying there. If you travelling around Vivo City or Santosa Island and have difficulty to find place for praying, you must go to this Masjid.
I was staying for 4 days (15 to 18 April 2018) on Bay Hotel, beside the Masjid and was enjoying to pray in this Masjid.
You can ask people in this Masjid where you can find halal food on the neighborhood.
I will consider to stay near this Masjid for my next visit to Singapore.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102933015514944291589/reviews
