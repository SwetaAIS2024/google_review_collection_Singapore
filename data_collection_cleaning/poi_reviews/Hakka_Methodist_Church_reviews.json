Although there are a lot of senior citizens here, they are very friendly and vibrant.\n\nThere are services in Hakka, Philipines and also English. They have line dancing as well for the seniors to learn and befriend each other.\nThe strong ties among all the seniors are really very lovable. They are also very faithful to come church every week.\n\nThey also organise yearly trips to bond the seniors together.\n\n#ILoveHakkaMethodistChurch",
