U have no idea what feasting with your eyes means till you dine here!\nLoved how as you approach the dining area, the huge balloons were placed as the backdrop, followed by the lovely Peranakan setting with personalised labels so the guests know where to sit.\nThe vibrant colours of Nasi ulam makes it a must try even if you are not a huge fan of it!\nThe special birthday noodles looked simple but the taste is beyond expectations.\nNext is my favourite dessert tray! 4 different sweets in a tray! Plus the most fantastic giant ondeh ondeh cake that not only brought a huge smile to the birthday girl but it definitely wowed the guests! From how it was presented to the taste scored a perfect 10!\nI would definitely recommend anyone who have not tried private dining to make this your 1st!\nI just love the details and effort put in everything!\nSimply Awesome üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã",

The flavor was perfectly balanced ‚Äì the rich pandan cake was soft and moist, and the gula melaka filling added just the right amount of sweetness. Every bite was a little burst of joy! My family loved it too, and we all agreed it‚Äôs one of the best cakes we've ever had. If you haven‚Äôt tried it yet, you‚Äôre definitely missing out! Highly recommend!",
