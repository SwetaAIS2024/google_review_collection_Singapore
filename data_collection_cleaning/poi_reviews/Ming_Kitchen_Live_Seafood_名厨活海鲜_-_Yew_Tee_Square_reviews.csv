Alger Chua,1,"Probably the worst dinner I had so far~~~

Soup is so salty to the extent till several tables complained along with us.
Got the second batch but still equally bad.

Paying few hundred to get egg white soup.

Fish first time when arrived, was raw.
After which they steam it again and the flesh is over cooked.

Very disappointed as their standard should be better than this but perhaps they are very over-whelmed

Charred rice is as good as soy sauce rice.
Someone probably sponsored them with too much soy sauce that they have to pour plenty into the food they serve.

Horrible Terrible

Ryder Lim,4,Waited for very long to get all the food but the curry fish head was nice and went well with the rice. Prawn paste chicken wings are also very nice and came while still warm.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115378143302332157784/reviews
WilsonW,4,Enjoyed the dinner at YTS. The beef dish was good & the rest were pretty alright. Asked for less oily & salty to the order. Will return again.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113833197345189466261/reviews
James Ng,5,"Read many bad reviews of this stall. But i don't think it is too bad. For $38, we got a curry fish head, sambal kangkong, and 2Ã— rice for 2 pax.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103212205174351628436/reviews
