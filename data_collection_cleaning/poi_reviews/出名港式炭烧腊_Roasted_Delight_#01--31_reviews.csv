Xenia Xenia,4,"Very fragrant danggui herbal roast duck. Ate here several times and the roast pork has always been very crispy, even when packed in takeaway containers. The noodles even comes with fried pork lard. Located in a spacious and well-ventilated coffee shop with many other offerings.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111600227375904831761/reviews
