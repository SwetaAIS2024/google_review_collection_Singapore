I ordered chaat, achari tikka, veg biryani (nawabi one), and rabdi jalebi (which was okayish 3.5/5), were amazingly delicious. If you are in Singapore and wish to go for a fine dine experience with Indian taste and great hospitality, Yantra is a must visit. I found it a bit pricy but looking at the quality of food, I think it’s worth.\n\nGreat experience, wish to visit again!",

It’s a carefully curated menu representing dishes from different regions of India. What was fascinating was the history and cultural significance behind each dish. The food and service were simply outstanding and the ambience very cosy. Big thanks to Tim and the team who attended to us. We had a delightful evening.",
