      "text": "A mosque that looks magical and has that special feel to it.\n\nStaff/volunteers managing the mosque has done a great job. Place looks creatively decorated with clear distinct features to attract audience of all levels.\n\nLets dive in!\n\nLocation:\nMosque looks isolated away from other hdb blocks but that is the plus point of it. It means it may not disrupt the peace of nearby residents.\n\nCarpark:\nThere are lots inside but limited, same as many other mosques in Singapore. There are other vehicle owners that park along road, which is slightly risky..but hey, one is going only for a short while, it should be ok for 5mins.. but dont quote us yeah ðŸ˜….\n\nInterior:\nThe ambience, colour, placements of ablution area and such were well planned. This modern looking mosque has a very high ceiling which does seem abit intriguing..\n\nAll in all, we enjoyed the peace and serenity that mosque has to offer. A great place to stop by, unwind and recharge.\n\nSide note, i think there are some construction going on on one of the sides, so u may be affected while praying in earnest. Jz ignore that yeah.\n\nEnjoy!",
