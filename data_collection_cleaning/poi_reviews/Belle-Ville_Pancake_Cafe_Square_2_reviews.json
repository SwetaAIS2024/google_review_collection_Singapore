Go for the 4-piece stack for a slight price top up.\n\nItâ€™s a pity that they used to provide drinking water at no cost.",

      "text": "We have been passing by this shop, so I thought I would give it a try today. What a disappointment.\n\nService\nStaff at the door was friendly, but as she was looking out for potential customers, she couldn't see diners who might need help from time to time. But overall, they were polite and attentive enough to offer stool for bags.\n\nAtmosphere\nIt was near empty despite lunch hours. Only 2 other tables were occupied, but we were given a 2 seaters, which was a little small when the food and tea were being served.\n\nFood\nQuite a disappointment. Look at the pictures. The chai tea was super diluted even though we timed it using the hourglass given. I felt like it was a tea bag about to be thrown out after your drink, and then you decided to have a last refill of water. That's exactly how the big pot of tea tasted.  Not to mention, the milk was cold. So, nothing could save this drink. The worst chai tea we ever had. I would rather have a smaller cup than a big diluted pot.\n\nHuge serving of pancakes, but they  can't really be compared to those fluffy pancakes you can get elsewhere. We have definitely tasted better ones. At most, I can say they are better than McDonald's.\n\nThe potato honey sandwich was the only good order, but that alone will not be a pull factor for a revisit.",

      "text": "Belle-ville is the go-to place for deliciously fluffy pancake fix and usually packed with diners. Stopped by cafe for brekkie over the weekend and were surprised to be assigned a table immediately. Also, our sandwich sets (Ham & Cheese Hot Sandwich + CafÃ¨ Mocha and BLT Sandwich + CafÃ¨ LattÃ©) were served pretty fast, albeit the fully filled cafe at that juncture. The classic BLT Sandwich was unexpectedly subpar - lifeless and lacking flavor; a letdown! With scant mayo and bacon, yellowish lettuce and toasted bread devoid of the crunch outside and softness inside, this ultimate sandwich failed to deliver a myriad of flavors and textures it supposed to contain.\nThe cafe is rather small. Tables are set up largely to fit 1-4 diners so big group gatherings are discouraged. Its tight space and metal chairs aren't too comfortable or conducive for long chats and chill out. Best to visit off-peak or be prepared to wait for seats and service.",
