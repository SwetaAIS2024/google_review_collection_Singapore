The Biodynamic Duo,4,"If you‚Äôre wondering why it changed its name from ‚ÄúPotato Head‚Äù to ‚Äú1939 Singapore‚Äù, it‚Äôs not because it changed ownership, but because the brand wanted to lean into local culture as opposed to ‚Äúbeach club-meets-restaurant‚Äù Bali vibe.

Sat on the Rooftop Bar, was hot.

Menu is so-so, with some happy hour options too.
The fish tacos were tasty, the chicken tacos not so much.

The burger (Smokin B Boy) was too salty and too well done. Fries were amazing and so were the chicken wings

Service can be improved.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101966057015930925345/reviews
Marcos O. Diogo,4,"One of the most beautiful bars in town full of charming not only this bar is beautiful but the neighbourhood, I would highly recommend you to make this one of your stops if you‚Äôre around.

Unfortunately the rooftops was closed due to a private event but we had fun anyways in the second level

The food came out quickly and tasted delicious, the only reason I‚Äôm giving this place 4* is because the service was a bit rushed and the price slightly high",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113809644458768259113/reviews
Belle Tan,3,"I used to frequent this place more often from 2015-2018 as the Rambo burger was really quite unmatched then. Unfortunately, newer burger establishments have sprung up and the Rambo of today did fall short both in taste and price.

A meal in that picture plus a dessert and (non-alcoholic) drink added up to $100. Definitely better options out there for your burger, unless you were feeling a tad nostalgic like me.

I‚Äôm so glad the new owners kept the original interior, but a serious refresh of menu offerings is needed to keep up with the fast changing, relentless competition in F&B",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111871902098879786966/reviews
Gibrand Cruz,5,"Some of the best burgers in Singapore hands down. I love the food every time I come, although I do miss the mushroom toasties from the old menu (pls bring them back!)

The service is excellent, all of the staff are so friendly and accommodating, the food is always delicious and the drinks are incredible. I've tried a lot of cocktails and they're all great, I personally recommend the coconut negroni.

The ambience and atmosphere are on point. All 3 floors have different vibes but equally great, Although the rooftop bar is my favorite. The DJs they bring sometimes also add to the experience.

Overall, I highly recommend 1939/Potato Head. 5 stars üåü",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114241521605512628733/reviews
Vishal Chokkala,5,"A fun little restro-bar which offers some serene views, good hospitality and amazing hand-crafted drinks. We enjoyed chicken burgers and the impossible chicken burger while taking sips from some of the unique cocktails, I recommend the one with jalapeno and whisky and the other with coconut and rum/gin, very tasty!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104937800367731115090/reviews
