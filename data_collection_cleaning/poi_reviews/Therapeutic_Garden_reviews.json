      "text": "The park is designed to be easily accessed by all, especially the elderly. The themed sections of each garden celebrates tropical plants that are not commonly seen in our city but has extensive ethnobotanical uses and backgrounds, such as tongkat ali, belinjau, bunga kesidang (bread flower), and ylang ylang. The plants are all labelled with adorable, painted rustic wooden log slices. I hope that NParks will include a QR code on them so we can further read more about these plants as they deserve our appreciation!\nThe park also attracted insects such as cicadas and the blue-banded bee which my father used to see in his kampong many years ago. The flora and fauna really stimulates the senses and nolstagia. I appreciate how the benches and shelters within the therapeutic garden are sturdy and shaded. There are two fans installed in the central shelter too.",
