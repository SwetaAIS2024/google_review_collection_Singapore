In those days, when there was no running water supply, bullock carts used to carry buckets of well water through this road, and \"Chinatown\" was named after this. Chinatown People's Theater and Chinatown Community Club are on Vanner Hill along this road, and Keong Sik Street is not far away. ． ． ． ．",
