Jason Donovah,4,"TPS has good staff by and large. Our son just completed P6.

Right from Mdm Has, Mrs Ho, Mr Goh(maths), Ms Soon(science), Mdm Low(chinese) to the vast majority are thoroughly professionally and exhibit palpable intent to uplift children.However, an unrepentant English teacher was largely demotivating and repetitively negative towards the students - the leadership knows and hope they address this.

We chose this school because of their track record of partnership with parent groups, parents, etc. And they definitely kept their reputation in this regard.

Thank you.TPS team and leadership.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105187550609318471716/reviews
Hehe Boi,1,"The best thing I can say about tmps is the holidays when we don't have to go to school. Even so, the workload is unbearable. The teachers were not caring or passionate, especially a chinese teacher Mdm Liu. Facilities were bad and short recess time. Disliked my time here ðŸ‘Ž really hated it. Content was not even properly taught",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104617478094222732586/reviews
