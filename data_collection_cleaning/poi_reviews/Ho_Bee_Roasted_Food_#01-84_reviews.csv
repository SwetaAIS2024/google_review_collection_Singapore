David Wong,4,"The roast pork n duck drum are good n will give a rating of 7.5 out of 10.  Ah char was free n generous portion.

Char siew is bad and like those used at WTM stalls n I rate this as 4 out of 10.  Review from others were misleading although individual taste

Q is chaotic but lady operators were friendly n remind to take cutlery.   Overall, 6 for this visit.  May come back for roast pork n duck drum.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107910285093716374068/reviews
Chee Sergi Junn Yeow,5,"One of the best roast duck, pork stalls. The duck is succulent and the roasted pork skin is crispy. Auntie is also very patient, friendly and accommodative. You can call in advance to order for take away. Just pay and pick up when you arrive.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113577747866543961404/reviews
EQ Xavier,4,"The food is delicious, the roast duck is juicy and moist, and has a rich meaty taste. The char siew is roasted as to a nice charred, not very sweet but good enough to be savoury. The archar is a highlight, very crunchy and sour to add to the taste. The owner can remember all the order which is very amazing. However the queue cutting is a problem as they let the regular jump in the order. Soup is also a nice touch to the meal",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533019712721928126/reviews
JS Ang,5,"Chanced upon this store by chance, noticed a strangely long queue on a quiet evening when many stores are closedâ€¦for a good reason!

Price and serving portion was good! There was accompanying archar and soup, even for takeaway! Auntie was friendly :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108662358072869988902/reviews
