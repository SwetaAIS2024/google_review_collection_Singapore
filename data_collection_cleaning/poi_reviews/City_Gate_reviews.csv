SD Ten,4,"The shopping mall is clean and spacious, but it lacks high-traffic stores that would attract more visitors. There are nice dessert store and cosy bakery cafe at the quiet basement level, is a pleasant place to sit and enjoy food or drinks.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103364138582765261108/reviews
Ceedo Liu,1,"NO BIDET IN TOILET

I can see very elegant toilets on some floors, must have spent a fortune on them.

But there is ZERO bidet sprayer. No bidet sprayer at all.

I had to flush 10 times to use the ""mini fountain"" created by the flushes to clean my butthole. Must have used at least 5 liter or water there.
Saved cost by removing them? Think again",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107437390692635343217/reviews
