J Seng,4,"This place serves a mouthwatering braised pork belly bun. The pork belly is tender and juicy, with a rich and fragrant dark soy sauce. The bun is soft and fluffy, and goes well with the meat. The lotus seeds paste and the small pau are also delightful. The paste is smooth and sweet, and the pau is steamed to perfection. This is a great place to enjoy some traditional Chinese snacks.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116938237846338409963/reviews
