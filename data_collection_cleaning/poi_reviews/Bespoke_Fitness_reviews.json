      "text": "Cozy little 24/7 gym. Perfect for nearby resident and working people. Affordable and finger print door lock (very high tech sia).\n\nThere is public transport everyday and shuttle bus from one-north on weekdays, but the last bus is around 8.30pm for public bus. A bit harder to access on odd hours which defeat the 24/7 purposes but overall a great place to workout.\n\nThey have great cross fit classes according to my colleagues. I join mainly for the open gym, equipments are maintained, a little bit limited due to the space and cross fit themed but the owners themselves being gym goer would see to our needs.",

      "text": "I decided to try this gym out after the nearby Gymboxx decided to shutdown. Though initially skeptical since the gym is fairly small - I couldn't have been more wrong.\nRun by siblings - Yan & Tiat. Both provide excellent coaching - crossfit style. They provide classes at a very reasonable price which I would highly recommend. Each day is focused on a different body part & is never the same through out the year. If you are serious about your fitness you will not be disappointed. #nowimpyworkout",

And the fact that I am skinny by nature didn’t help because I simply never felt the urgent need to workout.\nBespoke got me addicted in few months I saw my body changing but mostly it was beneficial to my mind.\nMy back problems have improved a lot too.\nCouldn’t recommend bespoke fitness more.\nOpen to everyone: skinny, overweight, old, young, fit , unfit :)",
