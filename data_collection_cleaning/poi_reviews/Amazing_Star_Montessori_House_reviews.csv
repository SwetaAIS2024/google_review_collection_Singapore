Chloe Fam,5,"I am thrilled to share how much Isabelle looks forward to going to Amazing Star every day. After experiencing several schools in different areas due to our relocations, I can confidently say that Amazing Star stands out as the best. The school syllabus is advanced and rich compared to others, providing an exceptional learning experience. Additionally, the focus on morals and manners is truly commendable.

The food is another highlight—Isabelle always raves about how delicious and healthy it is, often asking for second helpings. The school’s care for the children extends beyond education, as they provide daily showers and wash their hair every other day, a service we haven’t found elsewhere.

The teachers are very experienced and have been serving the school for many years, which adds to the stability and quality of the education provided. They also provide us with monthly reports on Isabelle’s progress, which helps us stay informed and involved in her development. There is also a good number of staff to ensure there is enough manpower to take care of all the children, which is something we didn’t find in the previous two schools Isabelle attended.

The variety of enrichment classes adds an extra layer of fun to Isabelle’s school day. I highly recommend Amazing Star for its outstanding curriculum, dedicated staff, care, and overall environment.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109898042363187074943/reviews
Rasaporn Sampachanya,5,"Highly recommended childcare for our lovely kids! Very good and attentive teachers. Homey environment. Montessori curriculum, which supports the child's growth and learning.

My elder son who's now in P1 still misses his memorable times at Amazing Star. It had been truly a second home to him. Now my younger son is in nursery. He loves going to school and has never cried on any school day since day1!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107379703622212691163/reviews

The centre principal Tr Jaz, teachers and aunties are all very professional, dedicated and friendly.

She loves going to school and is always happy when we pick her up. The teachers show genuine care and concern, often giving hugs and radiating warmth. We couldn't ask for a better environment for our child.

Terry Teo,5,We enrolled both our daughters into Amazing Star and we are very confident with the teaching staff and the overall environment. My younger daughter is still in K1 and Teacher Shereena and Li Laoshi have been nothing short of amazing. The fact that they always inform us even if it is just a knock on the table gives us huge assurance that our girl is in very good hands. My girl has been progressing well under their teachings too. The aunties are very pleasant and my daughter loves the cooking. I'm really glad we made the change from another school and my elder daughter still has the fondest memories there even after she has left for P1 this year.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103298399111202045860/reviews
