Make an appeal and told them the clinic allows less than 3 weeks as they need to convert back to cosmetic clinic. Waste alot of my time and they are not responsible for what they did. Did a complaint to MOH on them. VEry disappointed with the clinic and their staff. Never apologise till now.",

Went down for it and realized that they were not open. I texted the staff and she said they will be opening so gave them awhile. I waited for 30mins and still no one showed up. Very disappointed in the clinic. Never going there again.",
