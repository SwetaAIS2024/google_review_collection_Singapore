Alright folk, Donkey and I recently went to Golden Village Katong for a movie treat. We were really excited to see their fantastic festive deals. We learned that joining the GV Movie Club is a great way to save money, with members getting $2 off movie tickets on Mondays and Tuesdays (selected locations), $2 off Combo of the Week (selected locations), and 10% off food and beverages at Gold Class and Azul.

We were also thrilled about the festive season promotions. They're offering a great discount on your movie ticket, priced at just $8 (Monday-Thursday) or $11.50 (Friday-Sunday).

We were also excited to try their Gold Class weekday lunch special. It's a fantastic deal. You can purchase two Gold Class meal sets (each $12.90) and get a free Gold Class movie ticket. We didn't manage to snag the deals this time, but we're definitely coming back to take advantage of them next time, especially the Gold Class weekday lunch special.

We were pleasantly surprised by the lack of crowds at this Golden Village location. It was nice to have a more relaxed and spacious movie-going experience. The theater itself was clean. However, Donkey and I found the seating a bit less comfortable than some other Golden Village locations we've been to.

We enjoyed our movie, and we love that the mall also provides convenient dining and shopping options, making it easy to make a day of it.

We highly recommend checking out their Gold Class weekday lunch special. Its definitely worth checking out. We'll be back soon to take advantage of those great deals.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews

Samantha Ang,4,"Overall great experience.

The seats were super comfortable. I felt like i was in the perfect angle of incline.

I usually get cold easily but i was feeling warm in the theater. The leather seat made it worse and i was sticky and sweaty. Would recommend to turn up the AC.

Food was pretty average. The same usual standard. I only got popcorn and nachos (that came with decent chilli and bean dip). Perhaps next time i would try a proper meal to better rate.

Service is definitely amazing. From the moment we entered, the ticket staff and the bar staff were courteous, friendly and very helpful.

It will be difficult to go back to regular movie experience after gold class. Haha",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108208405288989222806/reviews
Hhhh,1,"It was a bad experience, the staff was extremely unfriendly.
On Sunday afternoon, before watching the movie with my daughter, we wanted to buy two popcorn from the counter and 2 orange juice from the nearby Ijooz machine. However, the line was very long and the staff were inefficient, we waited in queue for about 7 mins, and even though the movie was nearly starting, we still hadn’t reached the counter. So we split up, my daughter continued waiting in queue while I went to buy the orange juice.
When I returned, it was almost my daughter’s turn. Because there were so many people in queue, I didn’t try to push through the crowd but waited on the side. When it came time for my daughter, since she was very young and I was worried she wouldn’t be able to explain clearly, so I went over to assist her. At that moment, an Indian male employee whose name started with an A rudely asked me, “Did you cut in line?” I explained that my daughter had been waiting in queue the whole time and that I had only stepped out to buy the orange juice. Yet he not only did he not apologize, but insisted, “I saw you coming from that side.”
Come on, with so many people in queue at that time, how could I possibly have cut in line? Besides, I have never cut in line and I truly despise those who do. Being falsely accused by an employee who refused to listen to my explanation made me feel absolutely terrible.
The entire cinema was managed chaotically as well, there was no ticket checking at the entrance, and once inside the screening room, someone was sitting in our assigned seat. In short, I will never come to this cinema again …",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112261631672570084181/reviews
