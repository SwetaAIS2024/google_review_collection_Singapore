Linda Kathleen Casey,5,"Lovely condo in a quiet enclave off of noisier Grange Road. Gorgeous and well-maintained facilities, water features, and the most beautiful views of all the landed houses nearby. The building management are responsive and helpful, and all the staff are professional and take their duties seriously. Friendly community of neighbors throughout the condo. Lived here for a little more than 3 years, and we loved it. Despite the fact that the Orchard Blvd MRT being built just next door was in early stages of construction when we first moved in, and the work paused due to Covid (meaning we had an eyesore of a view for most of the time we lived there), we didnâ€™t really notice it because there were so many more pros than cons about the apartment and building. Perfect location. Bus stops just a few steps away, and when the MRT station is complete and in operation, this condo will be pretty close to perfect. Recommend highly. Would live there again in a heartbeat.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104355181684578685545/reviews
