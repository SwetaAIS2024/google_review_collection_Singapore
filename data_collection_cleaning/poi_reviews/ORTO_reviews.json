The crews and the boss were super friendly and guided us through the entire experience, ensuring we knew how to prawn.\n\nThe event was well-structured, with an hour of interactive team-building games followed by an hour of. Prawning. We played three fun games that brought our team together. Despite the wet weather, it didn‚Äôt dampen our spirits‚Äîeveryone had a fantastic time!\n\nThis was our first team event of the year, and set the bar high! I highly recommend this experience for both corporate teams and families looking to bond and have fun. Thanks for a memorable day! ü¶êüéâ",

Only 5 mins walk from Haw Par Villa MRT\n\nFor a perfect family day out, Orto has it all‚Äîgreat food and thrilling games!\n\nWe started with a buffet at Paradise Asian Buffet, enjoying a wide variety of dishes before heading to INMERS for some action-packed fun. We played 4 interactive games. \"Hit Point‚Äù tested our aim and memory, while ‚ÄúThe Floor is Lava‚Äù had us strategizing and jumping our way to victory. Each 15‚Äì20 minute game kept us hooked!",

      "text": "A one-stop hangout place that offers an array of exciting activities and dining options for individuals and families to enjoy from dawn till dusk.\n\nThey have alot eateries here!! So far I have tried eateries like Coastal Acoustic, a pet friendly western restaurant and bar. They offers western-style dishes and grilled meats, with its speciality being roasted chicken that has been brined to keep it nice and juicy on the inside.  They have live band on weekend too!\n\nIf you‚Äôre obsessed with Thai food, you must stop Kinn Derm for delicious delicacies from the Land of Smile. While eating, soak in the good vibes with good tunes coming from the live band performances. I love the authenic Thai food here.\n\nI haven't tried Le White Bar, a local concept Pub & Bar for karaoke, darts, pool and  foods and drinks. But seems like a laid-back place for chill. I see alot people inside.\n\nThere's Mo‚Äôs House of Rock. The ultimate destination for sports enthusiasts, music lovers, and foodies. They also have live music and pool table. I like their food as well.\n\nAs for activities, they have prawning!! 2 large prawning ponds consisting mainly of big head prawns. Located indoors and well-ventilated, can enjoy a comfortable prawning session. I had a good time catching my prawns and they are really HUGE!!!!! After catching your prawns, you get to feast on them at 88 Seafood, located within the same premises. Or you can bring home. I brought my prawns home to cook.\n\nIf you‚Äôre feeling adventurous, can go INMERS, that offer a theatrical immersive experiences unlike anything else in Singapore. Got Interactive and fun games. Perfect bonding activity. We had so much here! Especially the room you step on the colours destinated. They have escape room too!\n\nI think is a cool place to come spend the whole day here",

Hygiene is a pretty solid 5/5star, as I was there today from 10.30pm to 12.30am. Prawn was pretty big and fresh. Spend 2 hours to catch and the weight was worth more than 1.5 kg and their food there is really nice and amazing. Furthermore, the staff were friendly and helpful there.\nWould definitely recommend! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",
