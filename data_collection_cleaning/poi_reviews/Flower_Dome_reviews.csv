Coralie Pattenden,5,"Absolutely loved my visit to the Flower Dome! The entire place is beautifully maintained, cool and comfortable, and perfect for a leisurely wander surrounded by nature’s finest. I was fortunate to visit during the Tulip Festival, and it was nothing short of spectacular.

The dome was bursting with vibrant tulips in an incredible range of colours and varieties. The themed displays, complete with a charming Dutch windmill and scenic backdrops, made it feel like a slice of the Netherlands right here in Singapore. Everything was thoughtfully arranged, with informative signs that added a lovely educational touch.

I highly recommend a visit to the Flower Dome — especially if you can catch one of their seasonal festivals. It’s a floral haven that’s enjoyable for all ages!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117229625285925810802/reviews
Eugene T,5,We visited the Flower Dome during the theme of Tulipmania and it was absolutely gorgeous. The exhibit had just kicked off so the tulips were still fresh and not completely opened. It’s indoors and air conditioned so definitely a place to cool off from the heat. There are plenty of plant varieties ranging from cactus to local plants and international favourites.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100738974040986588380/reviews
Damcho Tshering,5,"The Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay was amazing! Super cool inside (literally and figuratively) with flowers from all over the world. Great spot for photos, relaxing strolls, and escaping the heat. My family loved it, especially the themed displays.

It has great places for horticulture lovers too.
No to mention, there are others near by iconic places to visit.

From 29 May 2025 the term will be the jurassic world. It will be a new event in the Cloud forest.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106709368718057183639/reviews
