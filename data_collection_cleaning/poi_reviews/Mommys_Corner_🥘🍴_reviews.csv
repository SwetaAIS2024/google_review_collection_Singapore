Gunno Tisto,5,"Food is great and delicious made by seasoned chef. repeat customer & will come back again.

Owner is a retired head chef since Long beach restaurant in 1990s whose food delighted common people, dignitaries, and ministers alike. I have eaten multiple dishes cooked in innovative ways that they imagined to life (from Porridges -> curry noodle -> fish soup -> chicken rice -> Hokkien Mee) all within a span of a year. Everything tastes great and served with good utensils unlike other standard PVC plates and bowls.

This store is a great hidden gem in heart of Potong Pasir & fortunately not many are aware of it (hence not much queues ðŸ˜‰). Will keep visiting back this shop again.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104993652722437956014/reviews
Justin Tan (Astroprime),5,"Tried both their curry dishes ( rice and noodles)...both were excellent and quite pleasant at a very good price.

Curry was not too salty and chicken was nicely steamed and tender. Presentation surprised me a lot with how beautiful the fried egg is.

For the price U pay, the meal was very worth it!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110256534313535397879/reviews

Karmen W,5,"Yummy soy sauce chicken set meal. Good presentation. On another day, I bought the fish porridge. As Iâ€™m used to Cantonese-style porridge, the taste profile was slightly different. They used fresh fish slices so there were a few tiny bones to be careful of; just bear in mind if buying for children or old folks who might need feeding care.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112611623010233365594/reviews
David Lee,5,"The chicken and fish soups tasted really good, with a good balance of flavour that wasnâ€™t overpowering. Chicken and fish pieces were cooked to a great texture and firmness.

Plating was quite spot on too. Would want to come back to try their banh mi.

Customer service was great too.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106483448210801544426/reviews
