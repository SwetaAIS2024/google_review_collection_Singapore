whale,1,"DRINKS STORE IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS !!!!

ordered a teh peng siu dai and uncle heard my order loud and clear but didn't bother to make me a less sweet drink ! was ready to serve me a premade sweetened tea drink and right before he capped the drink i reminded him gently that my drink is less sweet. uncle just said ""oh liddat ah ? then i add water for u"" and he proceeds to dilute the drink with water !!!

typically teh peng less sweet is either they put less sugar while they r making the drink (if they make it from scratch). otherwise for premade versions, they will add more tea so overall the drink becomes less sweet.

despite ""diluting"" the drink with water the drink is still excessively sweet and i will NEVER want anyone to drink from this store. ridiculous service, quality and taste.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109886963416349846127/reviews
Chun Howe Tan,1,"Went there on 12 Apr 25 at 530pm to have some soup from é˜¿2. Ordered white pepper pig stomach soup ($6.5), winter melon pork rib soup ($5.5) and steamed meat patty ($6).

The meat patty is about 5cm in diameter and about 2cm thick. It tasted porky and lacked marination. I will not recommend getting it.

The pig stomach soup tasted super weird with a burning sensation seemingly from a chemical source. I requested an exchange immediately and told the stall attendant to taste it. He took a small sip, gave his partner a weird look and poured away the rest onto the floor.

I almost wanted to buy another bowl for him to finish in front of me when he told me the soup tasted normal. I will say that this soup tasted as though it had detergent mixed inside.

The subsequent exchange to a cheaper soup choice made me swore that I will never visit this coffee shop ever again. I left after forcing less than 50% of the food down.

The last time I had food leftover was 5 years ago when the lobster restaurant waiter at Changi Jewel de-shelled the lobster with the same glove after touching the restaurant floor.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117736576065260420968/reviews
Samantha Ang,4,"Love ordering here!

The food is really good and the staffs are always very kind so service is top notch too.

Highly recommend the assam fish and pork ribs.

Fish eat until not a single drop of sauce left. Pork ribs eat until not enough.

One thing to note tho, the lady said yusheng comes with salmon but its actually mock salmon. Could have said that it was vegetarian. I would have ordered the abalone yusheng.

Felt abit cheated.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108208405288989222806/reviews
Louise,4,"Located next to Fairprice, it is a good place to eat zi char at the Kimly Seafood. Very nice fried rice! The Assam fish head, Japanese fried tofu on hotplate and chicken youtiao were delicious!

There are other stalls in this food court like popiah, Chinese stir-fried and soup.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117093153718443163460/reviews
