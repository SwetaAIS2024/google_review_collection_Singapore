SS Lim,5,"Tabao a roasted chicken rice, added chicken and an egg. Less than $6 which is value for $. Auntie taking the orders is so friendly and nice. Service is fast. However this coffee shop is rather rowdy and has the cigarette smell when you walk past.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106576145281715059901/reviews
Orange,5,"One of the best curry chicken noodle. Noodles are those high quality ones, cooked perfectly and springy. Curry is milky which I like. Chicken thigh add on is $1, cooked perfectly as well.

Chicken rice is also decently cooked. You can feel every grain of rice. Veg portion is good and also on point. Chicken breast however so so, a little powdery. Not sure why.

Chili however is not so spicy, wished it is better. Soup is good, well seasoned.

Will definitely come back and have other dish here as well.

17 Aug 2024 went back to have their half chicken $18. Chicken is really big sized. Wished that itâ€™s more springy. Would only give a 3 star out of 5 for the chicken.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
Chintiong Teo,5,The stall is located within a rather cramp coffeeshop. I ordered half roasted chicken and 3 packs of rice to go for dinner. Got to say that the chicken rice was very fluffy and aromatic. Really loved it. Roast chicken was juicy and succulent and the chilli was spicy but complementary with the rice and meaties. Recommended if you are in the vicinity of CCK and crave for chicky rice.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117248174332543506846/reviews
H.s Hon,2,"Came here seeing the good reviews and was utterly disappointed!
Ordered 2 sets of chicken rice but the taste was meh.
Rice taste soggy without any taste!
Meat was absolutely tasteless!
Even the veggies and liver itself tasted like steam veggies without any effort.
Soup was at least a bit decent.
The only saving grace is the price which was pretty affordable.
Probably one of the worse chicken rice I've ever tasted.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103947120045126572130/reviews
Star Carter,4,"This stall gained recent attention thanks to the YouTube video that ranked it no1 .. in terms of safe and good chicken rice. It was busy during lunch but queue moves fast, they offer poached, grilled and fried, and we ordered both poached and grilled. The rice is noticeably grainy, every grain is firm and seasoned optimally, making it enjoyable to keep eating. The chicken portion is generous and taste alright, great with the tangy chilli. the pickle and soup adds extra layer to the meal, pickles are crunchy and soup is tasty (free refill). The staff are friendly and coffee shop is relatively clean and airy. Overall, the rice stood up the most for me, pickles and soup are great. Will come back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113622550090507912080/reviews
