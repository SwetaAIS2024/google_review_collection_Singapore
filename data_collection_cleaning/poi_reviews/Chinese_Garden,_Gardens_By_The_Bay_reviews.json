The park features a variety of gardens, including the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, and Supertree Grove, each offering a distinct experience.\n\nThe Flower Dome is a massive greenhouse that houses a diverse collection of plants from around the world, including orchids, cacti, and Mediterranean flora. The Cloud Forest, on the other hand, is a misty, tropical rainforest environment with a towering waterfall and a unique \"Cloud Walk\" that allows visitors to walk among the trees. The Supertree Grove is a collection of towering, futuristic trees that are both visually stunning and functional, serving as solar panels and vertical gardens.\n\nBeyond the gardens, Gardens by the Bay also offers a range of attractions, including the OCBC Skyway, a walkway that provides panoramic views of the park and the city skyline, and the ArtScience Museum, a unique museum dedicated to the intersection of art, science, and technology.\n\nOverall, Gardens by the Bay is a must-visit destination for anyone visiting Singapore. Its unique blend of nature, technology, and art creates a truly unforgettable experience.",
