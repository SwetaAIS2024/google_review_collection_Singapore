Meng Pok Thum,5,"Although Hup Lee has many chain stalls, but this stalll at Elias Mall is outstanding, good choices for staple: white and black bee hoon, black mee, hokkien mee, mee tai make. Great variety for topping: fried egg, fried beancurd, braised bean stick, fried squid paste, otah, chicken wings, Taiwan sausage, ngoh hiang, cabbage, 3 types of fish cakes, western sausage, spring roll, hash brown, sea weed chicken. Chilli taste great and not too spicy. Staff are very friendly and work very fast. One of the popular stalls in this coffee shop. Price is wallet friendly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117910893271871312647/reviews
steven lim,4,"Had a pretty nice plate of fried noodles and bee hoon for $3.90.  The portion was okay, and the accompanying fried cabbage was fresh and delish.  Also enjoyed the fishcake, and  the chilli was really good.

Others seem to like it too - saw someone order multiple packets for over $50.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117434407303387249783/reviews
LG Wong,2,Very pricey. Items price go up 50¢ for CNY. Then after CNY every item went up by 10¢. It's way too pricey. Will no go there again next time.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292608462598378283/reviews
C,3,"The food at this place is pretty pricey, especially given that it consisted mostly of processed options.

While the portions were commendably generous, the food was served cold. For the same cost ($5.10), there are offerings from other stalls that deliver better value and quality.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103681808350324057547/reviews
