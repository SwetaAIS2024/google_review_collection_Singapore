      "text": "Purchased calcium tablets and protein worth 80 SGD from this store. Shocking lack of customer care that afternoon. Came in on crutches with a freshly broken foot in a massive cast. Was the only customer in the store and had to call for a shop assistant to help me reach tablet containers. They did see me but didn't come over until  I called. Store assistant made little effort to help me select the correct tablets, ended up hopping and twisting, almost losing balance on my crutches. She kept recommending joint meds even though I specifically asked for something to help recovery from broken bones while pointing at my foot fracture saying it's broken and no, it's not a sprain. She and her colleague then vanished, left me standing there while I was trying to read the product descriptions of items in the lowest shelves that I couldn't reach because I was holding onto my crutches and onto the shelf. Another customer entered who saw me pushing a product I wanted to purchase around on the floor with one of the crutches. Fellow customer immediately came to help. Store assistant made no effort to pass the product from the shelf or help me read the label or pick it up from the ground for me. Store assistants simply looked at me and kept ignoring me until I checked out. I signalled to her to push the containers a bit forward onto the counter so I can actually reach them and place in my bag. Remember I was on crutches holding onto the counter and not able to move closer. And no, I don't need a carrier because I need both hands to manoeuvre the crutches and my body out of your store. The entire time she just stared at me (not sure whether it was with pity or surprise or disgust).\n\nNever seen a temporarily disabled white young woman on crutches or what? Also didn't offer any support with opening the door when I was trying to leave the store. Had to use my crutch to push the button. No other customers in the store when I left, so can't say she was busy attending to other patrons.\n\nPlease train your staff to be a bit more accommodating to customers with temporary disabilities or mobility issues.\n\nPlease train your staff on how to help build an inclusive society.\n\nOne day they might end up with a broken foot and will be grateful if someone helps them around the store, select the most suitable products or open the door.",

However, the pharmacy wording in-store gives the impression there is a pharmacist as they used to have.\nI have checked & double checked that the pharmacy section is now permanently closed, so this location does not carry prescription medication anymore.",
