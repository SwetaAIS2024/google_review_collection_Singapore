Isaac L,4,"Tucked away in the bustling Fernvale hawker center, Lala Story offers a dining experience that’s worth a visit. The setting is quintessential hawker style—casual and lively, though a bit warm. If they could just turn up the cooling fan, it would be absolutely perfect.

Food-wise, it’s a mixed bag but generally above average. Some dishes hit the mark, while others leave a bit to be desired.  The broth is really a plus and the condiments are a standout.  .There’s not much more to say, but the key takeaway is that I’d definitely come back, especially on a cooler day when the heat isn’t as much of a factor.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103715143213981871749/reviews

Anne Tan,5,Newly opened tasty Lala hotpot for this cold weather. Plump and juicy Lala with flavorful soup base which you can add on the soup for free. Chili was spicy and ShIOK. Ingredients were fresh and price was reasonable. The charcoal was still burning even when we finish our meal. Our comfort food. A place not to be miss. Will be back soon. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110672998771679512756/reviews
