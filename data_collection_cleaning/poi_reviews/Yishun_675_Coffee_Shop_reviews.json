Return the egg to counter they say will change but who dare to eat the egg. So we refuse to take the egg but they dont even give back the money just act nothing.

      "text": "Mixed reviews for different stalls which I had tried before. Read more about it below.\n\nFishball noodle stall - 1/5\n\nFrequently visit this stall until something happen. Not too sure about other timing but often seen operated by 2 ladies in the morning. Food is nice and maintain its standard. Short hair lady usually is the one cooking and often very accurate n quick when taking orders. However, beware of another lady in the stall, who is usually helping to take orders and payment. Price can varies from day to day for the same item ordered for takeaway and does not tally with the price indicated.\n\nUpdated - 27/11/24\nThe new guy at the noodle stall doesn’t feel like working at all.\n\nThai food - 4.5/5\n\nNewly open not long ago. Ran by Thai ladies. The flavour were authentic and staff were friendly. Just have to wait abit during meal time.\n\nZhi char - 4/5\n\nNever go wrong with this stall, tried over 10-15 dishes, none of the dish is bad. Standard comfort Zhi char.\n\nBriyani stall - 3.5/5\n\nOnly tried once, their Prata was ok. Reason for not trying other dishes is that the stall lack of a visible menu to show customer what is available and the pricing.\n\nRoast Duck Rice - 4.5/5\n\nRan by a kind lady boss. Extra rice and takeaway at no charges. Food is up to standard. Recommend roasted dang gui duck.\n\nHandmade Noodle - 4/5\n\nAffordable price and food taste great with a home feeling ran by a grumpy lady boss.\nComfort food when you are unsure what to eat.\n\nEconomic Rice - 1.5/5\n\nVariety of food remain pretty much the same everyday. Ran by 2 uncles and 1 aunty. Seems like each individual have their own pricing chart. Price varies for same items ordered, ranging from $0.5-$1.8. Standard varies across different dish but mostly still is edible, if you don’t mind the behind the scene.\n\nNasi lemak/Economic Beehoon - 3/5\nAverage standard, pricey food.\n\nMala - Did not try\n\nSeen cockroaches crawling around in the mala stall I am ordering food next door.\n\nWestern Food - did not try",
