Jolene Lim,1,"Blk 727- I've been to this coffee shop a few times, and while I don't expect exceptional service, I do hope for basic courtesy and a smile. Unfortunately, the server with curly hair and a ponytail consistently fails to deliver on this.

My visit today with my family, was despite the welcoming atmosphere, the server's attitude was again disappointing. This was especially noticeable since I had previously met the boss, who was friendly and welcoming.

What's concerning is that this server's behavior seems to be a recurring issue. Today, I witnessed another customer express frustration with the server's attitude after being informed that a dish was unavailable despite being told it was available earlier.

I hope the management takes these feedback seriously and addresses the server's behavior. A little courtesy and attentiveness can go a long way in making customers feel valued.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110080068093701653696/reviews
