Derek Hardwick,5,"Well done Singapore, I really enjoyed the walk around, through the tunnels, listening to the recordings and seeing the diorama and mock up of soldiers and the numerous guns and canons. It is a pity that Australia and New Zealand don't follow your lead in restoration of these historic sites. Was the highlight of my trip to Sentosa and best of all it was free!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115182406278439071027/reviews
Jennifer Liepin,4,"Pros: it’s free, I like military history, I’m glad they preserved this. The Skywalk offers great reviews.
Cons: it’s probably not a fun place to take kids or most people :) displays aren’t very interesting. A lot of material written is repeated. Seems a very set it, and forget it museum.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107459204527494230825/reviews
Miles Macdonald,5,"I loved this place. Whilst crowds of people head for the ""modern entertainment"" attractions like the luge runs, theme park, aquarium, etc, this place is not only quiet and peaceful, but full of historic interest. Just follow the heritage trail, which will take you around the area, visiting gun batteries, old fort buildings, and museums. You can get here by just taking the Cablecar for some great views. Then, just take the lift up to the Skywalk, which brings you to the fort and heritage trail.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112943810663501022344/reviews
Shynn Loh,5,"Very interesting place to learn about the history of Singapore during the Japanese Occupation.
The bunkers and tunnels are still well kept and intact.
Although can be creepy along some tunnels accompanied by wax figurines, the entire experience is fruitful and educational.
Not wheelchair friendly though. But for people whom are interested in history and war, can always visit and take a hike.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115476362835087426309/reviews
barb weber,5,This place is really cool. Suggest taking the sky walk way which is free then the rest of the exhibition  are all going down  instead of walking up.  Some of the exhibition  will be active  when you walk into they and tell you what is happening all in english.  Great place for history people.  Everything is marked really well.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108414329286331041856/reviews
