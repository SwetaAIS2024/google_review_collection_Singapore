Panda Rider,1,Order already late. They still choose to cook the walk in order first even after I have arrived. When handing order to me. They claimed that the “foodpanda machine has no sound”. But I already saw the printed ticket hanging in their kitchen. It’s one thing to have slow service. But worse when you’re lying about it.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103362325207315853426/reviews
