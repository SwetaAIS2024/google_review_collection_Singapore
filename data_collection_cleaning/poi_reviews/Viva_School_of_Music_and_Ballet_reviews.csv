Rhodyn,5,"I have been with Viva School for close to a decade, since I started my journey with music! The teachers there are highly qualified, having an impeccable western education at music conservatories. This has helped me in competitions and assessments, as the teachers are able to highlight and develop artistic details. Teacher Tanya was my first piano and theory teacher, and she helped me learn and grow in a nurturing environment whilst helping me develop a strong artistic flair. Currently, I am training under highly acclaimed piano teacher teacher Natalia. Teacher Natalia’s strong attention to detail and dedication to her work has had a strong and lasting impact on me. As i progressed up the music ladder further to take O Level Music as an academic subject, Dr. Peter’s skilled expertise and knowledge opened my eyes to more music details I had never realised. I had gone from barely passing to coming in first in my class for an assessment! Not to mention, Teacher Tanya who had also majored in music composing came in handy when she had helped me further develop my compositions. I view Viva as family, with teachers who are nurturing and strong-willed to develop their students. Most of the teachers have been there forever, with low overturn rate - which shows how friendly the environment is there. Viva is the one stop solution for a balanced music education. 10/10.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100467247391447462201/reviews
Gail Lisa,5,"So happy to have found Viva ballet. Under the tutelage of Teacher Olga, I've successfully completed my RAD Grade 3 & 4 exams to date as an adult dancer new to ballet.
I am grateful for the dedication of Teacher Olga in making sure that we not only memorise a dance, but that it is executed anatomically correct and beautiful.
As a bonus, since I have started ballet, my posture has also improved. I love my lessons and always feel happy attending my classes.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105561951147558293833/reviews

Rebekah Yeo,5,"The studio is a gem, I am so glad I walked in one day and decided to take a trial class there. I heartily recommend Ms Olga Badenova to my avid dancer friends who wish to refine their technique and wish to receive training in the Vaganova style. She has transformed my understanding of key ballet principles, and I am able to move with much greater freedom now :) Her detailed instruction and keen eye for detail has enabled me to practise so much more effectively and progress in months things which I have been trying to fix for years.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117526057462308173650/reviews
