Sentimental Android,2,"The Swiss roll is nice but the attitude of a female worker is questionable. Is she one of the owners? Why is she always rude? Has she ever realised this? She is that type of person that we say 没家教 or kurang ajar. Over the years, whenever I happen to be in the area of Arab Area, I patronize the store, I always feel disgusted by that woman.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117931502971682906917/reviews
Sandra,3,"It's a bakery. Purchased through d window. Aunty's customer service is v good. She's also v fast.

Pandan cheese swiss roll used is cream cheese. Only sweet, no salty. I prefer sweet+salty kind of pandan cheese. Also bought seasonal mango swiss roll. This is better than pandan cheese.

$12 flat rate. Cash payment only.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108444186723547263962/reviews
Steven Chee,5,"My utmost favourite is the kaya swiss roll. Best Kaya Swiss Roll I’ve tried made of authentic real good old days kaya that tastes like what my late mother used to make at home. Brings back good memories. I’ve also tried the other flavours like Chocolate, Strawberry & Pandan Cheese. Looking forward to try more. The sponge cake is dense yet soft and not dry and the filling is generous, good quality ingredients (not just butter cream) not too sweet and very satisfying indeed. Always a hit at gatherings with the kids and adults alike. Keeps well and fresh in the fridge for 2 days. Affordable at $12 per roll and value for the price you pay.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111094385264128964254/reviews
Gator,4,"A very unassuming cake shop and I nearly missed the entrance. Gotta keep a lookout for it. Anyway, they only accept cash for payment and no other forms of payment available. There are no seatings as well only for takeaway.

The cakes were very soft and spongy. Quite good. I had the chocolate and Kaya. Gotta eat within three days as they don’t use any preservatives.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
wendypie,1,The cream used for the chocolate cake was so buttery and oily. Leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Cream did not taste like chocolate at all. Highly not recommended. Unable to finish a slice of the cake. Very disappointing.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111670940554668291097/reviews
