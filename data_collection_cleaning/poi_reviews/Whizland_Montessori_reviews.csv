G,5,"My child previously refused to go to sch. We changed twice and decided to try Whizland and I'm so glad we made that decision. He's happy, looking forward to go to sch in the morning every day and I'm really glad that we don't have to struggle with him every morning just to drag him to school now. Too many schs in the area so its hard to find a good school. The teachers here (e.g. Tr Chua, Mdm Tan) are really patient with my child. Thank you!!

Jenefa Arivazhagan (PrincessOfDaddyJesus),5,Wonderful school. My girl was there a year and if we didnâ€™t change home we would have stayed. Not sure if tr shasha and tr dawn still there but there are both wonderful educators. Thank you!,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117502649488628396054/reviews
Eug Y,5,"The teachers here are really patient with my child. They provide updates via newsletters and photos of my kid's learning process and are very responsive to my queries too.

Update:
My kid learnt many things and was happy to go to school. She could tell me what she learnt during the Montessori period and what she could do (E.g. knowing how to button up). These are some life skills that I don't really realise that I have not taught my kid what or how to do in real life, unfortunately. ðŸ˜‚",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109838753158408271093/reviews
Wendy Chew,1,The staff  very unfriendly and not helpful . I can understand that not very nice to let me use their toilet but if a person really have stomach pain early in morning and there is no toilet around they should help me and let me use their toilet due to emergency. I keep asking them to let me use the staff totally reject me. Their attitude really very bad.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104794728065049865564/reviews
