Merryheart,4,"A nice mall with a wide plenty of food & beverage options & free 1st hour parking.  2nd & 3rd hour also free for more than $30 spend. There are 2 pizzerias, local zi char, Blanco Court steamed fish / fish steak boat, Japanese BBQ, Korean BBQ, Toast Box cafe, Saigon coffee, Punjabi food, Master Prata, Italian bistro, Chinese Pao, Otoko ramen etc. The zi char is quite good in terms of price & quality.  Good place for people who like to explore food options. If you canâ€™t find anything you like, just cross the road to the Alexandra Village food centre.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101391398296811227556/reviews
Jeffrey Chong,1,I was shock the eatery Just Eat boss at the mall L1 raises his voice and shouted at us.  A complete shame to the mall for his rudeness.  Pls think twice before you speak to him.   It has caused a bad image to the mall and I hope the management will look into this.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110598111195930295624/reviews
Loo Poh Keng,1,"A SCAM

I had 2 hours free car park and I went in after 5:30pm. I left 1hr after. I was charged $5+.
They do not honor the long parking form which I took 15 mins to fill in.Parking is NOT free altho we spent about $50 on our dinner .No attendant at the customer service.It is outright scam.

Caden Wan,1,"Attention!!
SCAMING IN THE MALL BY MANAGEMENT THEMSELF.

I had 2 hours free car park and I went in after 6pm. Which is legitimately written per entry after 6pm. I left 2.5 hrs after. I was charge a per entry charge.

NOW! They either follow per entry or per hour. How could u charge per entry at the same time giving per hour free entry. BIG SCAM. Do not trust the mcst. I tried talking to that Indian lady through the comms she just smack out and told me to email management. What a day!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110684189014888444327/reviews
