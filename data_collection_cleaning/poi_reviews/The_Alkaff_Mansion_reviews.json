      "text": "Classic, gorgeous venue as we all already know and love! I visited for the Tea Pawty high-tea set with my furbabies.\n\nThe high tea set is quite mid for the price compared to other places I’ve been to. $165.45 after tax for 2 pax and 2 dogs.\n\nThe tea and drink selection is very limited (maybe less than 8 tea flavours & the one I wanted was not available), the setup was just a wooden board, and the pet snacks were just mini packaged treats and not actual dog pastries/food (I did appreciate that it was quality pet treats though!). The food itself was also very mid, bread was stale, tarts were soggy, the cakes had that ‘mass produced’ catered sort of taste. The kind of quality you’d usually expect from a corporate event.\n\nI think you’d just expect more from a place like The Alkaff Mansion. They have the capacity to be way more imaginative and thoughtful with the presentation, and have more layers in the flavours. I was more impressed with the thought and effort that went into dog treat packaging and the variety/quality of the snacks. Only worth the visit if you just want nice pictures and don’t care about the taste of the food!",

Not so easy to reach without a car but worth the effort for the location alone.\n\nWe'll be back to sample more dishes.\n\nTop tip - use the 'secret' car park on the right at the top of the hill - and park in the shadow of the mansion amongst the trees in the shade",
