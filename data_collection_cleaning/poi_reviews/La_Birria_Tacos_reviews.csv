Georgia Leaper,5,"Lovely hidden gem of a spot. Menu only has 2 taco and 2 nacho options, so you know it‚Äôs going to be really good. The food was piping hot, fresh and mouth watering. There was a small wait and just simple seating but for the price and authenticity of the slow cooked meat, this is a must visit in Singapore.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109371564144359123164/reviews
Meiier Arnault,4,Nice place which reminds me of my college time in the states. Food is nice but due to operational decisions it's price can be marginally high for some. It is quite close to another Mexican food joint with long queues.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107143518511446494546/reviews

Whether you're into their the classic which is their signature Birria Taco or something more adventurous like the Sambal Belachan Fish Taco, there's a perfect choice for everyone. The service is friendly, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. Every visit feels like you're part of the family.

Debra,5,"Tried their signature tacos for the first time at the Kampong Glam Bazaar last year (the queue was so long but really worth the wait) - it honestly tastes so different from any other tacos you can find locally. The consomm√© is super unique tasting.

Few months later, they released their Sambal Belachan Fish Tacos & it‚Äôs really the best thing on their menu right now, for me, personally (although I wish it was spicier hehe).

So glad they‚Äôre finally settling down into curbside crafters soon and hopefully there‚Äôll be more on their menu (more spicy items please) üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105599215474127916269/reviews
Ilham Aqil,5,"Absolutely phenomenal! I recently discovered this hidden gem of a birria taco spot, and I can‚Äôt stop raving about it. From the moment I walked in, the warm, inviting atmosphere made me feel right at home.

The birria tacos are truly a work of art! The meat is incredibly tender and flavorful, bursting with rich spices that transport you straight to Mexico. Each taco is generously filled and comes with a side of luscious consom√© that is perfect for dipping. I also appreciated the fresh, handmade tortillas‚Äîso soft and authentic!

What sets this place apart is their commitment to using fresh, local ingredients. You can really taste the quality in every bite. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, eager to recommend their favorites and ensure you have a delightful experience.

If you‚Äôre in the mood for some mouthwatering birria tacos, do yourself a favor and visit this amazing spot. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back for more! Highly recommend!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110755818994380778532/reviews
