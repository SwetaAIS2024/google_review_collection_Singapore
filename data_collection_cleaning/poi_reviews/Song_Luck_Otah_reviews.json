      "text": "I‚Äôve tried so many otah buns before but nothing beats this!! Their otah is spicy enough (even my parents approved of this) and each otah bun is filled with chunks of fish!! Even though they do not specialise in buns, their white and pandan buns are so soft and fluffy!! These otah buns make such a good breakfast/snack option!!! Highly highly recommended!!! Please try it for yourself üòçüëåüèºüëçüèº",

My family and friends love their Otah buns, crispy Otah and even just the Otah alone.\nThe Otah is incredibly flavorful, with a perfect blend of spices that complements the rich, savory taste of the fish. The seasoning is well balanced and spiciness just nice. If you love Otah, you must try Otah from Song luck yummy!",
