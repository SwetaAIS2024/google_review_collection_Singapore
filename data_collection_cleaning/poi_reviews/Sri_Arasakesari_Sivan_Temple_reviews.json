Unfortunately, the meals have consistently been disappointing often bland and lacking the care one would expect, especially considering the amount we pay. Despite bringing this issue to the attention of the management on multiple occasions, no noticeable improvements have been made. It's disheartening, as food served in a temple setting should reflect the love and devotion inherent to such a place. I sincerely hope the temple management will address this concern to enhance the overall experience for devotees.",
