Their versions of the chilli is slightly more sour and tangy which adds a nice taste along with the savoury rice. I must complement their soup defintely tasted rich.",

The chicken thigh was tender, smooth, and definitely not oily. Soup was delicious.\n\nOnly downside is that this is a popular stall, so expect to queue. However you can understand why it's popular when u take the first bite.\n\nThey offer chicken rice in $4/5/6 options with a top up required for wing, thigh or drumstick.",

The chicken rice fluffy and flavourful, the chicken juicy and soft.\nBest of all is the price, it is affordable. What you see on my plate is $4.\nDon’t forget to take the ginger and chili, it is nice condiment.",

Every mouthful of the meat for me must come with chilli, sweet sauce and ginger paste. It's sinful, but absolutely heavenly. Be prepared to queue for 20-30 minutes during peak hours. Be warned. Fortunately, this stall has not come into radar of the so many so called food gourmets or online food critics. I've no complaints about it, otherwise queue will even be longer :)",
