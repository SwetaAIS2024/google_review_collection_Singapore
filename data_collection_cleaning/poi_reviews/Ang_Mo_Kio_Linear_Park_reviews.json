You can take a longer walk along the boundary and then choose to cut across the park if you need to make a beeline out of the park.\n\nThere are many smaller facilities like exercise stops and playground for different user groups.\n\nVery nice environment to exercise.  Not flanked by overgrown trees, trailing spider webs like some older parks.",

Through elegant design, it broke through its geographical constraints.\n\nLovely simple traditional swings, meditative pebbles are the icing on the cakes.\n\nThe downside is excessively hardworking landscape workers still working at 9pm!",
