I was free and wanted to get my eyesight checked as the vision was slightly blurry with my current prescription.\n\nGot a quick response and an early appointment for the same day with Ming Optique at 58 Marine Terrace.\n\nI travelled 30 minutes and arrived on time, and I was greeted politely by Veron and Daniel. Daniel patiently, professionally, and thoroughly checked my eyes.\n\nI waited comfortably for 10 minutes for new lenses to be created and fitted to my existing spectacle frame, with good pricing.\n\nI got great insights regarding contact lenses and reading glasses.\n\nI am happy with and totally recommend contacting Ming Optique for your optical needs.",

Ming Optique kindly helped me to repair my glasses on the spot, and free of charge. Am really appreciative for the wonderful service. Will be back and will recommend that my friends and family come support :)",

Always has the customers at the heart of what they do.\nVery diligent with his work and will give sincere advice not just trying to sell more expensive lens.\nThis helps to build trust.\nI have been going back to them over more than one year now and would highly recommend to anyone.",

Daniel & Veron are true experts in their field and their advice, recommendations and inputs were extremely helpful. Their passion is contagious and I wish I had discovered this little place much earlier. I had some challenges to get glasses since I need a rather small model but they could help me out in no time and with candid feedback. The shop seems rather small but they do cover the spectrum plus they know what fits and what doesn't.\n\nThank you both for your support and all the very best. Until we meet again :)",
