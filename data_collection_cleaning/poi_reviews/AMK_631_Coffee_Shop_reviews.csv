S L,4,"Tried the chicken chop at a local coffee shop â€” the crispy skin was a highlight, but the chicken itself leaned on the dry side. The sides were a mixed bag: the mashed potatoes were a bit too creamy for my taste, but the tater tots were crispy and enjoyable. Overall, a decent meal with room for improvement.

Chee Sergi Junn Yeow,5,"This is one of the cleanest coffee shops that I know of. It has a good variety of stalls selling different food. Fish soup, rojak, zi char, chicken rice, Muslim food, chai fan, etc. The toilets are clean and well maintained. The service staff here are mostly seniors but very courteous, friendly and smiley. Everyone seems happy to work here.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113577747866543961404/reviews

Beary Beary,4,"A Large and Nicely Renovated Coffeeshop.

There are various food stalls here. Deserving special mention is the mixed rice stall. The cheapest I've had in years and of very decent quality. $3.00 for curry chicken, vegetables and steamed egg with less rice. The bee hoon stall has a unique ""bee hoon"" choice that looks like Hokkien Mee. Price is not as cheap as the mixed rice stall but it is very reasonable and opens 24 hours.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101788329090998743221/reviews
Tan Junyu,4,The fish is packed with fragant of the dried solefish however it slightly pricey. U wouldn't go wrong with 925 chicken rice. The chicken is nice and succulent. ðŸ˜‹,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113984036409422535641/reviews
