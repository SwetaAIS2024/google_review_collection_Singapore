navindran bobby,4,"Portion of the food is reasonable to the price. Food tasted pretty decent. Looks overcooked and dry but itâ€™s tender and made fresh. There are 2 types of Indomie.
1st is the normal indomie.
2nd is the samyang indomie. (very spicy)
The indomie is slightly overcooked. But i love my indomie to be that texture. Overall decent, would return again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107714780671973680969/reviews
Nur Iqlimah,5,"Since I prefer noodles over rice, this place is really a great place for me to eat.. and the fact they also have Indomie world favourite instant noodles, that is even better. The taste they create here is seriously nicer than how I made it. No kidding. It is slightly wet and not soggy.

Pair with wantan and ebi-fry, add on chicken seaweed and with their spicy sauce..totally bomb. They even have cracker on the side. What more could you ask..

Hopefully many will try this place.

Ps: they even have dendeng indomie and satay in cup...",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112154388875110526113/reviews
Khalid Muhammad,2,"A couple times here and I finally make my decision and review

Food is ok but service needs to improve.

The Good, Bad and Ugly Review;

Good: There are lots of options to choose from. The food is ok for it's price.

Bad: Service needs to be improved. The one serving will always have an attitude.

Ugly: this is the umpteen times that after ordering the ""Mee Rebus Satay"" and paying for it, they will give you mutton instead of what you requested for. The guy will say all the satay is available to choose, but once you pay, he will claim that there is only mutton left.

Ridiculous.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101137063274750938958/reviews
