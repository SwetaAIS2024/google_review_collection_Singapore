Asia Apparel,4,Preordered the tickets at Klook. Fast and easy. It was simple good fun with three different digital experience. Suitable for kids as well. Personally I like the log digital roller coaster experience. The 4d movie being a old concept is a good experience for the kids as they never tried it before. Very helpful and friendly staffs at this facility.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112168507594751691491/reviews
A G,5,"Iâ€™d like to commend Wen Yan, the Guest Ambassador at the 4D Adventure Station, for her outstanding service. Her kindness, gentle demeanor, and consistently polite and courteous manner truly stood out. She made our experience not only smooth but also memorable with her warm approach and attentiveness. Itâ€™s clear she takes pride in her role and genuinely cares about the guests.
A true asset to the team â€” thank you, Wen Yan!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100362691445617779946/reviews
VEMULA SURESH,5,Great place to spend sometime! We bought the 4 show combo! The motion vehicle ride was the best! Weâ€™re literally thrown around in the ride vehicle ðŸ˜‚ the shooting one was fun too! The 4D show was just fun ðŸ˜‚ similar to Shrek ride in USS! Recommended for kids and families! 5 ðŸŒŸ,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111344154564727157881/reviews
Super Kiwi,4,"A little pricey. But all the staff were so lovely and accommodating!

The 2 4d rides are pretty cool, the seat moving is a bit more powerful than most of the rides at universal, so be careful small children may not like this.
Very good for most adults, unless you have neck/back problems.

These rides have improved a lot over the years!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103755918024672622730/reviews
Eliza Teo,1,"Sadly inflexible policies for quite pricey tickets. Bought 3x rides for parents and kids but kid was scared after 1 ride, so we wasted 2 rides as we were not allowed to let our adult family members use the other ride credits that we paid for.  There was no queue and not many customers - They would rather play the games to empty rooms than to allow flexible use of credits and improve their customer experience. Sentosa, you can do better than this.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114303381305561706697/reviews
