CCS,3,"We were there to open an account around 4.30pm. Already staffs were turning customers away or advising them to do it online.

A hapless young man was trying very hard to assist a bewildered couple and an elderly lady with the DBS app.

Amazing. He was most patient while giving valuable advice and taking new customers through the process.  P

We got our new account set up in no time despite our initial apprehensions.

Just one man? Guess the good old days are gone when tellers are the face of retail banking.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews

Jonathan Phang,1,"** WARNING - Employee(s) at this DBS branch discriminate against Malaysians.**

If I could give negative 'stars', I would.

My wife got discriminated against for being 'just' a Malaysian, and the guy who worked there did not even bother even giving her the time of day.

She just wanted to open a bank account, was that too hard for you?

She's still a customer who should've been treated with way more respect.

Please get your employees re-educated on proper customer service, thanks.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107982684805962012124/reviews
JB Acoba,1,"I had the worst banking service experience  in Singapore today 18 January 2025 at 1200H.

My Q number flashed only a fews seconds and approached the staff but I was told that I missed the Q in the most rudest way possible. I did not hear my number was even called

I enquired how in the world I missed my Q when it is still posted on the screen and I was just pushed to wait just like than.

DBS can do better than this.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108482726133711199113/reviews
