Their extensive food menu focuses on Indian cuisine, adding a unique touch to the experience. While we only stopped by for a quick thirst quencher—a refreshing Highball—the menu looked promising. We will definitely be back to try their Chicken Butter Masala, which is their best-seller.",

Could be me not paying attention so, decided to come by to try.\nHad this in JB before and it was really good. It expensive based on JB standards.\n\nHere, the staff was patient and let us select what we wanted to eat with the noodles.\nThe choices were amazing.\nPrices are more than reasonable if you compared it to WoonKiang (RM66 vs S$26 for 3).\nStrictly speaking (and me being honest), the kwaytiaokia in JB was smoother, and much more flavourful as well as much more in the bowl.\nHowever, this was made up for the choices of accompanying foods here.\nAmazing decision to drop by.\nDo note that parking is sparse and limited.\n\nThey have also a wide selection of zichar choices should 卤not be your palette.\n\nThank you The Den.",
