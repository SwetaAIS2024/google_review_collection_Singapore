      "text": "I had a terrible experience at this outlet. It was 3:20 PM, and the place was nearly empty, with just one other customer besides me. The two kitchen staff (one male, one female) were incredibly rude, except for Gan at the cashier, who was polite while taking my order.\n\nSince it was my first time here, I wasn’t aware that the collection point was at the side, as my view was blocked by a pillar and a bin. I kept hearing my number being called repeatedly but saw nothing being served at the front, so I assumed there was a problem with the machine. Instead of simply informing me, the staff just kept pressing the buzzer. Worse still, the female staff member came out, looked at me, and walked away without saying anything.\n\nWhen I finally went to collect my order, the male staff member took the receipt from my tray and crushed it without any acknowledgment. I commented on the poor service, but neither of them bothered to apologize. This was by far the worst service I’ve experienced at this chain—I’ve never had such issues at other outlets like Oasis Terrace.",

Place is quite empty for a coffee place in the afternoon at 4pm. So it’s a great place to have a quiet coffee by yourself or a chat with a friend in a quiet place.",
