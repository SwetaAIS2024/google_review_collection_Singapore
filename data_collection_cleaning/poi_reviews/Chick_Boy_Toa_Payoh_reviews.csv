HC L,2,Paid $8.50 for the fish & chips and they gave 3 small pieces. Their picture showed 2 big pieces of fish. Ordered rice and they charge $2. Granted it’s flavoured rice but still ….the server did apologise for running out of tartare sauce and substituted mayonnaise for it. Won’t be back unless all the Western food stalls nearby are closed.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
Jack,3,"Thought that the menu is rather extensive for a coffeeshop western food. Decided to give the salted egg chicken cutlet a try. I like that the cutlet is piping hot, but perhaps too much batter and the crust falls out too easily. The portion is rather generous and goes well with the salted egg sauce. The sides comes with fries, baked beans and coleslaw are pretty average. Overall it's good value but food can certainly improve. Perhaps better to just focus on a few good items instead of such an extensive menu.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288565584051666357/reviews
Ars 3276,4,"Pretty new stall and heard good reviews.

Not too bad
Chicken parts were juicy, fresh and not dry at all. Its also not oily and crispy.

Katherine Mallari,1,The chicken is not freshly cooked but rather pre-cooked and only reheated. The salad also is not so fresh ingredients.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104779684145326093304/reviews
Chan “Toffees” Allen,4,"Tried for the first Time. Food was great, not too salty and fried chicken was fried ala minute resulted a very crispy skin and juicy meats. We requested no salt for fries and staff obliged. Service was great as well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110097176985965725951/reviews
