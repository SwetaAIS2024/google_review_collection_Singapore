      "text": "**MOSQUITO MAYHEM**\n\nMy first visit to the Clementi dog run will likely be my last. The area boasts a decent size with benches strategically placed at both ends, providing resting spots for pet owners. The run features sloping hills that offer an exciting terrain for dogs to run up and down, adding a dynamic element to their playtime. However, the experience was marred by the overwhelming presence of mosquitos.\n\nThe mosquitos were highly visible, swarming around both humans and dogs. It wasnâ€™t just a minor inconvenience; it felt like they were everywhere, making it impossible to ignore. Their constant buzzing and biting quickly turned what could have been an enjoyable outing into a rather unpleasant ordeal. Everyone there, without exception, was severely bitten, leaving us all itching and uncomfortable. The dogs, too, were affected, evident from their constant scratching and visible distress.\n\nWhile the Clementi dog run has potential due to its design and features, the mosquito problem is a significant deterrent. The management would need to address this issue seriously in order to make the dog run a more pleasant and safe environment for both dogs and their owners. Until then, I'll be looking for other dog-friendly spots that provide a more enjoyable experience.\n\n#NEA #AVS",
