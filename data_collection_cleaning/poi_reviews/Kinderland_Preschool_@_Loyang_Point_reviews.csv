Nafis Dali,5,"My girlâ€™s been at Kinderland Loyang since she was in infant care. Sheâ€™s turning 5 soon. Not the cheapest vis-a-vis the other options out there but we do get well and beyond what we are paying for.

Excellent facilities, educators, quality of feedback etc. My girl looks forward to school each day. And we do see her progress really well in her speech, confidence and other aspects of her development evey single week.

We did, for a period of one or two weeks, try to send her to another operator but the drop in standard was really alot to accept. Fortunately, Kinderland was really nice to take her back in and we have absolutely no regrets since. 5/5 (would have given an extra star or two if i could)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116162256715175725305/reviews
Melrize Ng,5,"Highly recommend Kinderland to parents looking for infant care services for their little one @ Pasir Ris.
The teachers are all so patient and attentive to all the kids which can be seen during drop-off and pick ups!

Located at the mall, the school is air conditioned and secured. The team takes great pride in ensuring the kids are well taken care of and learning in a clean and safe environment.

Working parents can also conveniently grab a light breakfast or coffee to go after dropping off their kids which can be done in less than 15 mins (grace period for free parking ðŸ˜‰).

My experience so far have been worry-free and a breeze and I hope all parents get to share this with me.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107713055309338382116/reviews
annie ng,5,"As a working parent, finding the right preschool for your child is crucial as the children would spend most of their time when we are working. We couldn't be happier with our decision to enroll our child at Kinderland at Loyang Point. All my 3 kids grow up in Kinderland at Loyang Point.

The teachers and staff in Kinderland at Loyang Point are genuinely caring about each child well being.

Their curriculum is thoughtfully designed to stimulate young minds. They incorporate music into learning to make learning fun and educational.

The facilities are well-maintained and clean, which create a confident knowing that our child is in a secure environment.

Communication with the preschool is excellent. The teachers keep us informed about our child's progress and any developments in the classroom. They also encourage parental involvement through events, workshops, and open communication channels.

In conclusion, they have exceeded our expectations in every way. It's clear that they prioritize the well-being and development of each child in their care and we are very happy that our kids have grown up well in their care.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102453888534383566057/reviews
Venessa Ng,5,"As a first-time parent, choosing the right infant care was daunting, but Kinderland at Loyang Point was a choice I never regretted. I entrusted my first child to their care since infancy and have been consistently impressed, and I plan to send my second child there as well.

The teachers are incredibly personable and attentive, making both the parents and children feel comfortable and valued. They go above and beyond in their care and vigilance. For instance, they were the first to notice my child's cow milk protein allergy when it could have been easily dismissed as colic. This attention to detail gave us significant comfort, showing how closely they monitor each child's health and well-being.

I highly recommend Kinderland at Loyang Point to any parents looking for a safe, nurturing, and professional environment for their little ones!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117328493659552781034/reviews
