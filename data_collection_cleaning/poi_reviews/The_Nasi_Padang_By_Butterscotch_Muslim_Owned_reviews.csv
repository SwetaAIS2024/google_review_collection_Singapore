Adam Ismail,4,"The dishes I chose were ok and I do feel that there's room for improvement and the nasi padang would be one of the best.

For a neighbourhood kopitiam stall, I find the food pricey.

I'll give points for the large portions given and steaming hot rice. üëçüèæ

Lodeh - 7/10
Sambal paru goreng -  8/10 (One of the better ones I've tasted)
Bagedil - 6/10
Tempe goreng - 6/10 (the batter is good and crispy, but the marination does not seep into the tempe. So it is not that tasty)

Fried Chicken wings - 6/10 (Same case as the Tempe. Tasted bland. Otherwise, it would be a good fried chicken)

The sambal tumis and serunding are nice. I'm going to try the nasi lemak or mee siam next.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109210815397801372164/reviews
Y W,5,"I absolutely love the sambal here. Super tasty. Nasi lemak was delicious and so was the sardine puff. Sardine puff was flavorful and the filling was generous.

Came back a few months later and the taste is as good as it was before. Highly recommend.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118297943299005507726/reviews
