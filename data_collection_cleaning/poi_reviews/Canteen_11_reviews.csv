Angelin,5,"In my opinion, BEST canteen in NTU. Caifan, Japanese, Szechuan stalls are all delicious and worth the price. I highly recommend the following:
1. Laziji at Szechuan stall
2. Karaage curry rice at Japanese stall
3. Fish or sweet sour pork at Caifan stall
4. Fried dumplings at Chinese noodle stall",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105417076759937799330/reviews
