The mutton should be cooked well, though the biryani was good, would be great if it was a bit more soft.\n\nThe atmosphere was okay but I hope they will do renovation and make it cleaner. The vibe was a bit dirty, we were only realised it when we already made an order.\n\nI think the price was reasonable.",

I found many shops in Singapore prepare a lot of prata to wait for customers to buy, but mostly it is cold. Their tea also good. Do try if you at jalan kayu. Not the shop beside the carpark. The prate beside carpark is bad in service and very hard prata. So please go to the correct shop to avoid disappointment.",

The curry sauce that came with it is very fragrant, you will be savoring every last drop of it. The same can‚Äôt be said about the mee goreng and maggie goreng pattaya. I felt it was missing some seasoning and the overall dish wasn‚Äôt well executed. It has more of a sweet than savoury flavour with all the ketchup on the egg.\n\nIn conclusion, I will be back for the pratas, not necessary the other dishes.",
