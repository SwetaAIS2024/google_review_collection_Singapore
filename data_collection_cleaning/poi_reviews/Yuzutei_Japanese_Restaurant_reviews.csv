Cheryl Teo,4,"First time trying yuzu shabu shabu. Very pleasantly surprised at the refreshing taste of the soup. Ingredients were fresh too! Very friendly waitress, although they were clearly understaffed on a Saturday evening. However, we werenâ€™t in a rush so it was not an issue for us.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110378852866450366882/reviews

LeLe Board,1,Super Stingy Place! You will need lots of patient to eat food here. Owner gives the low gas on purpose so that if the soup is never boiled she doesn't need to give us broth soup. She kept coming to turn off the gas although the food was not cooked.  It's hotpot place but they don't want to give you the soup ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ we all had to eat super salty food. OMG never again so stingy owner ðŸ˜‚,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112480481127270326391/reviews
Wong Jie Hong,5,One of those wonderful food places hidden within an industrial area. The meat was so soft and just melted in my mouth!! We had their mochi-waffle and it was such a great dessert to end our dinner!  ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101794432261835871250/reviews
C D,5,"Been coming here for years and itâ€™s always perfect. The yuzu makes such a nice soup base that draws out the flavors of whatever you add. The service is always perfect and the pricing very reasonable.

Itâ€™s only a 5 mins walk from nearest bus stop so go visit.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104299090849639324400/reviews
