Katherine Chong,4,"It was a catch up between 4 friends and we were promptly ushered to our table on second level. Food and drink service was prompt and a shout-out to the gentleman(whom we believed is the management/owner) who gave us warm greetings, went the extra mile to explain the various alcoholic drinks and their respective promo and sizes etc. Foodfare and drinks were all well executed amidst k-pop music that weren't too loud as well. A great place to meet up and chill with good food, drinks with relaxed ambience. Reasonable price range of ~$40/pax inclusive of kimchi Cheesy Bacon pancake,  gochugaru fried chix, spam fries, seafood stew w ramen & drinks! Recommended to visit.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105788009938157394909/reviews
Yongwe,4,"We were fortunate to get a table as walk-in customers on a Friday night. The place is not spacious yet the setup is cosy and there are tables upstairs as well. Is the perfect place to be if you are a small group of 3-4.

A great place to hangout, have some drinks and nice food. A good selection of atypical bar food as well as drinks. Nothing can go wrong with whichever food you choose. The makgeolli is highly recommended to try.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112933505229697638752/reviews
Xindy Ho,5,"Really the best Korean food I had in Singapore. Every dish is good would totally come back for kimchi mac and cheese and honey fried chicken.

Vasu,4,Amazing experience! Food is on the pricey side but I am very happy with the wide variety of vegetarian options. I ate with non vegetarian friends so the staff was happy to serve the meat separately. I highly recommend the sizzling mushroom trio and their kimchi stew. The makgeolli was pleasant and wonderful honey flavour!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105484231661582551727/reviews
Anita Ong,4,"Alcohol was good and interesting.
Food was ok for me only. Honey butter chicken was too sweet and the pork slices were yoo chewy (difficult to bit off the meat from the bone)
on hindsight, we should have ordered carbo since the sweetness and saltiness of the meat were quite strong",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103286191403433360080/reviews
