But it turn out that the white is light grey n light grey is darker grey.\n\nThe lady boss keep saying White is acceptable even after I provide photo showing clearly that the white turn out to be light grey.\n\nrefer to the photo, my original ceiling is white and wall is light grey. Both by ICI paint. You can observed very clearly that the ICI white Soon Hui sold me was clearly a matching grey to the light grey I repainted using Nippon Paint.\n\nI feedback there could be some error in the mixing which result wrong paint fill in the container. But lady boss think she provided correct paint, even though actual result show otherwise.\n\nMy advise is never buy fr this dishonour store.",
