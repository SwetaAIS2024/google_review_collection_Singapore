Masked Photographer,3,"My wife ordered mee siam, the Bee hoon texture was extremely hard, almost wire like. Told the staff the noodle was uncooked or cooked insufficiently. They mentioned nothing can be changed as the texture is determined by the supplier. Not recommended to order mee siam or any bee hoon related product.

Atmosphere and decor was nice. Hopefully other menu item is not as bad. The bright side is that the price point is very low for airport.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115158830186006648346/reviews
atyloh,4,Was very pleasantly surprised by the food here! The queue at Heavenly Wang next door was too long so we came here not expecting too much... but the dry laksa goreng was great as was the nasi lemak with dry curry chicken. Usually the rice in the nasi lemak nowadays is not fragrant with coconut but this one was really good. Would definitely eat here again!,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111399965301812778742/reviews
Miklos,4,"Beautiful retro deco with plenty of seatings, some can accommodate a larger group size.

Food is pretty decent, not bad, such as the dry curry chicken rice, which is pretty good and value for money.

Staff is a little shorthanded at times",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102392172058235258162/reviews
Paul Ng,2,"This place is a mystery. Its mother shop OCK  produces consistently good curry puffs that have stood the test of time. Yet this spin off cafe is just plain bad.

The you tiao was cold and soggy (but you have deep fryers and warmers in the OVK side) and the mee siam was… a poor excuse for mee siam.

OCK, just kill off Curry Times before it kills your off.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106929413532403056476/reviews
BoscoY,3,Food and price point is okay for an eatery in airport but there’s room for improvement for service as they look like they are understaffed. Their other outlets have better food quality and service.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111635797802384052078/reviews
