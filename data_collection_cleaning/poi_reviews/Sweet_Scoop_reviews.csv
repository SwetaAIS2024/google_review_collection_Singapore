Fern Bay,5,"Better than birds of paradise.
The ice cream doesn't melt fast even when it's on a waffle, so it's very pleasant to eat.
You don't eat a wet waffle at all!
The mouth feel is super good, doesn't taste artificial,a legit good ice cream.

I tried 2 of their waffles(normal and red velvet). The waffles were crispy outside and soft on the inside. Really nice to eat but I prefer the red velvet abit more.

In fact, I think it's better than the birds of paradise and they let you taste the flavors. Their durian is way better than birds of paradise.

Highly recommend,you wouldn't regret.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114677154331629626169/reviews
Hanyong Gan,5,"Worth the checkout, the waffles are prepared well with care, really appreciate the care gone into the food. Friendly owner!

Got a 2 piece original waffle + double scoop for $13.10, went along with a mint for her and a mango for myself.

Mango sorbet hit the spot so well, perfect in this hot weather, perfect sweetness and texture for my palate.

Had a bit of mango mixed in with the mint, and that was such a good combo of flavors too.

Mint flavor is definitely above average too, she was happily satisfied.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107544405829663453180/reviews

Bill,5,"Been curious and finally had a chance to try it last night. Their biscoff flavour is divine! Really good. Google rating of 4.9 doesnâ€™t lie. You must try it yourself and support local!
Visited again last weekend- superb!
Have been visiting a few times now, love their ice cream!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107909107247114958513/reviews
Darryl Ng,5,"The pandan waffles, extremely crispy & fragrant. The owner, is super hospitable & inviting!

I came over once to check out the shop and didnâ€™t buy, but he was super polite and thanked me for checking his shop out. Hence I came back again to try.

10/10! $7.60 for ice cream with waffles! Affordable and nice",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115693636525821436462/reviews
