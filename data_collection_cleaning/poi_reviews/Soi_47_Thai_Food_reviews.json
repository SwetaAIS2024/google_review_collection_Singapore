The Tom yum seafood was okay but hot, a bit on the salty side. There’s a chill out corner at the side of the restaurant. Service was good and prompt.",

My least is the moo ping as it’s fried instead of grill which makes it very dry and red ruby is not my type",

      "text": "Authentic Thai food. Tasty and value for money for portion given. Braised pork trotter is a little tough. Love the lime sauce squid - really appetising.\n\nService is a little lacking. They seem short handed and often got to chase after them for attention. During food ordering, staff seems a bit impatient.\n\nAtmosphere is fine for me. Normal under the block cafe style. Nothing outstanding yet nothing outrageous.\n\nRecommended for people who wants to enjoy authentic Thai food yet don’t want to break the wallet. Definitely for people who care more about the food than the atmosphere or service.",
