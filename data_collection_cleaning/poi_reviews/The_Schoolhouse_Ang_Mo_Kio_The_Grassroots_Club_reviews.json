      "text": "With a heavy heart, I’ve made the difficult decision to leave the team and transfer my boy to other center due to logistical concerns. This is a deeply emotional moment for me, as I had to say goodbye to my most trusted team of teachers and staff, who have truly become like family over the past 6 years. I am incredibly grateful for these lovely, kind-hearted individuals who have given my both kids such a memorable and impactful childhood. They’ve grown so well and been nurtured beautifully under Pats GRC's team care.\n\nSpecially thanks to the class teachers : 丁老师 & Ms Trysta, 张老师 & Ms Sya , 钟老师 & Ms Megan & Ms Elena. I’m truly grateful for the unconditional love and patience you've shown my kids. You gently guided them to reach their milestones, helped toilet train them, taught them to dress themselves, assisted with the transition from a milk bottle to a cup, and so much more. Each festival season, they learn new songs, dances, and performances, you filled their childhood with wonderful experiences. I can't thank you enough for your dedication.\n\nOthers teachers although are not my kids class teachers but their love to my kids are never the difference. They always greet us with the warm smile during the check in / out and also showed their concern to the kids. There was once my daughter experienced sudden separation anxiety at the age of five, 王老师went above and beyond to provide the best support, carrying her every day after check-in and comforting her. I felt such a sense of relief handing my crying toddler over to the teachers, knowing she would be in good hands.\n\nNot only the teachers , the kids are loved and pampered by the cleaner uncle Ang and kitchen aunty Mina & aunty Seetha too. On the 1st day when I accompanied my boy to school, there was a touching scene that I still remember till now. After Uncle Ang cleaning up the mess made by one 2 years old boy, Uncle Ang approached the boy and began feeding him a few spoonfuls of food while teachers were busy with other kids. Uncle Ang clearly concerned that the child wasn't eating much, especially since he had dropped a significant amount of food on the floor.\n\nNot forgetting the Principle - Ms Elsie, Vice principle - 赖老师, Ms Joelyn , and Admin - Ms Serene and also the Music teachers Ms Caroline who exposed the kids with so many different music instruments. The team at Pats GRC is so harmony, and I believe the leadership plays a key role in fostering a positive culture. They never failed to surprise the parents with kids amazing performance in all events , Father’s Day , Mother’s Day and especially the graduation day.\n\nI sincerely wish all the teachers & staff (or some ex teachers & staff)  in Pats GRC  continued success and have a wonderful time . All the best to you all!",

We love the activities and curriculum that has been adopted (balancing learning with play) and are very satisfied with how the school is well managed. Highly recommended!",

They are always prompt at providing feedback or helping with enquiries. The school involves the parents in many aspects. This year alone we have visited the school twice! I love that we get to see what the kids are up to, and their learning environment.",

      "text": "It is true to what it described itself to be, more than a preschool, to both my children who grew up with Pat's since they were both 6 months of age. It has been 3 years since my elder child graduated from Pat's but she would still tell me those years she spent with Pat's were the most fun years of her life. She holds fond memories of the teachers that patiently taught, nurture and guided her. My younger child will be graduating from Pat's end of this year which saddens me to think that we will be parting with the team of teachers who are like family to my children. Looking back, entrusting my children with Pat's was the best decision made as a parent!",

Am grateful for the dedicated, warm and nurturing teachers who helped my little ones settle in and provide the guidance they need in their formative years. Appreciate that Principal Ms Elsie and Vice principal Ms Joelynn are professional, committed and experienced. Centre administrator Ms Serene is helpful and prompt with advice on administrative matters. All of which make communication a breeze. Overall, the centre provides a conducive learning environment and varied curriculum to engage the children for a holistic development. Seeing my firstborn with fond memories of his preschool days  and my younger one looking forward to attending school everyday, sharing fun and happy anecdotes of daily events, are testaments to the wonderful team!",
