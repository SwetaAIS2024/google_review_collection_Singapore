wethriftsg,5,"I really needed a hair surgery and I took a chance on my hair transplant surgery with expirius in March and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised and grateful for my entire experience! The entire process was so smooth and efficient. Wan was very responsive and helpful throughout. The clinic that I did my surgery in was very high class and clean. The doctors are professional and explain to me in detail what to expect and how they will operate. I also like the accomodation that they put me in during the trip, a 4 star hotel near to the clinic, so it was very comfortable and convenient. The hair process only took me 3 days, and before I know it, I was flying back to Singapore with a new hair. I am very grateful for this surgery and I will recommend it to anyone who is interested!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105114173887850297103/reviews
Wan Aliff,5,"I did my surgery in May and I am pleasantly surprised by the quick and top class service that Expirius provided. I stayed in a nice hotel near to the clinic, and there was a staff that brought me to the clinic and gave me a VIP treatment. The clinic looks like a world class clinic and all the staff were very professional and treat me well. The procedure was fast and very efficient and the price was very reasonable for the quality! I will definitely recommend it to anyone that needs a hair surgery!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104477901932361425052/reviews
