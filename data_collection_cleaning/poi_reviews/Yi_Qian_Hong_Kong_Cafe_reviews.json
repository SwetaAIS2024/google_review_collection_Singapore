      "text": "My wife had some simple and yet very comfortingly good food at this HK cafe. Its Pork & Century Egg Congee looked simple but was very flavourful as we digged in. And the Shrimp Rice Roll was one of the best we've had - packed solid with decent shrimps enveloped in a thin rice roll.\n\nUPDATE\nMy wife and I revisited this HK cafe a week later to try its roasted meats and more of its dim sum - notably its roasted duck & pork, its har kau, glutinous rice, and BBQ pork pastry - which we also find to be very good.",

Uploaded more pics of the wanton noodles and my fav peanut sauce chee Cheong fan.\n\nWasn't expecting anything when I stepped into this cafe at railmall. But the food really blew me away. The peanut butter chee Cheong fan was the best. The noodle was good too and the roast meat. I find this better than other typical HK restaurant.",
