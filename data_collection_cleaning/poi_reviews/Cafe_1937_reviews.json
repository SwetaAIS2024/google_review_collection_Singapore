      "text": "Hidden within Haw Par Villa is this gem for resting and enjoying some food and drinks.\nWe ended our trip to Haw Par Villa here as it was just nice for lunchtime. Ordered the crispy chicken burger which my son gobbled up. He claimed it was similar to that of fast food chains. I ordered a nacho cheese with salsa. Salsa was very tangy.\nDon‚Äôt expect humongous serving portions for the reasonable prices. We even enjoyed a 20% discount when we showed our tickets to the Hell‚Äôs museum.\nNice jazzy music playing in the background, together with the chirping of birds and crickets‚Ä¶. Such a nice place to just chill! Love the vibe here. Will definitely visit this place again!",

Menu has lesser variety but it has all the basic features and common food, snacks and drinks in it.‚ú®Ô∏è Adaptable, modern and easy for all age too. üëç",
