      "text": "Overall, a great place for a budget stay in Singapore. The hotel is located close to the Rochor MRT station (downtown line).  The dormitory and washrooms were clean. The staff was quite helpful. Hot water for making tea/coffee or cup noodles was provided. The AC provided sufficient cooling. Every bed comes with a locker that can fit a duffel bag. They also offer luggage storage facility.\n\nThe bathroom was spacious and hot water was available in the shower area.  The hotel is located close to many eateries and supermarkets. It'd have been nice if drinking water was also provided without any additional charge.",

Only a bit noise came from across the room where there's KTV/music lounge that last until midnight but not really that noisy.\n\nStaffs was very friendly and helpful. Overall it was very good experience staying here.",
