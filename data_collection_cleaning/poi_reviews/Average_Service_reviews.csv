Lindy L,5,"We had such a wonderful brunch at Average Service. This place is kid friendly, for parents, you can ask the staff for some colouring paper and pencils to keep your kids busy while you dine.

Some of our favourites:
Steak and eggs, mentai pasta, charcoal karaage and truffle fries. If you have a sweet tooth, the maple toast is a definite must try.

Drinks were great too - they had a good selection of creative coffee options, as well as matcha options. For folks who don't drink, they also have a good mocktail list.

Note: they don't take reservations, so brunch/lunch time can get quite busy. Highly recommend going off peak hours, or perhaps to just pop by over dinner time!

Will definitely be back.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117581941323382412312/reviews
Blue Angel,4,First time dining here and I tried the bacon with egg and sourdough. It was tasty especially the bacon was salty. The egg with sourdough was nice. The salmon was nice especially the deep fried skin which was crispy. The air ventilation can be further improved as the kitchen was wide open and the cooking smell was all over the air conditioned cafe.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107945861603703795761/reviews
Alvan Sue,4,"A cozy spot for a quiet dinner—slightly warm inside, but the overall experience made up for it. Service was good: the team was friendly and gave thoughtful recommendations without being intrusive.

The highlight? The pairing. The cocktail they suggested went beautifully with the scallop pasta—light, floral, and a perfect counterbalance to the rich, savory noodles. You can tell some thought went into it.

If you appreciate good food and better drink pairings, this place delivers.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104704010107617256170/reviews
Sandra Aw,4,"Went on a Monday afternoon and the restaurant was not busy as expected. Only tried the strawberry foam matcha latte but find that the strawberry flavor is too mild, can’t really taste it.. the food selection looks amazing. Even have a kids menu with a few items, definitely bringing my kids here next time to try the dishes.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101138204889092244116/reviews
Aug Yx,5,"In love with their retro and jazz theme. Food is creative and delicious; a little on the pricey side. Staff service are definitely not average, for they are young, energetic and lovely people. A memorable venue that makes one revisit.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399463193902346018/reviews
