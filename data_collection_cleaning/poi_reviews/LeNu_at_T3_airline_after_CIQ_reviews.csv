Sherilyn Anne Chia,5,"Dining experience has always been great at this particular LeNu outlet as the staff Juindah has a great personality towards her customers and her customer service has always been excellent. Always end up coming back here to dine as I find the food really good, my favourite would definitely be the porridge as it's really tasty and their beef noodles! üëçüèª",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114019497152180096683/reviews
Tham Willie,5,"Here's a draft review for LeNu (T3):

_4.5/5 Stars_

I stumbled upon this unassuming noodle bar and was blown away by the rich flavors and generous portions. The Beef Shank Noodles stole the show - tender, fall-off-the-bone meat in a savory broth that's both comforting and indulgent. The noodles were cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of bite.

Service was friendly and efficient, despite the busy atmosphere. Prices are very reasonable, especially considering the large serving size.

Highly recommend LeNu (T3) for a satisfying and delicious meal that won't break the bank!

Highlights:

- Flavorful broth and tender beef shank
- Generous portions and reasonable prices
- Friendly and efficient service
- Cozy and bustling atmosphere

Recommendation: Don't miss the Beef Shank Noodles - it's a must-try!""

Jon Peng,4,"A safe place to have good smooth Cantonese porridge.

Porridge is smooth and the ingredients are fresh.

The Hong Kong egg noodles is crispy.
Prawn in the dumplings is fresh but I wish they gave more dumplings. My bowl only had 3 pieces of dumplings.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112666739737001299012/reviews

Grace Lim,5,"Paradise Group can do no wrong ‚Äî this unique combo makes the menus of both LeNu and Canton Paradise available at one place. Simple menu featuring one-bowl dishes of noods and congee, in really comfortable environs as you await your departing flight. It‚Äôs become an airport ritual.

I especially like the ability to add on side soups for $3.30 in the LeNu dry varieties. Service is great too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103361711923872389719/reviews
