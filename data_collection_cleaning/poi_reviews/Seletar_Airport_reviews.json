      "text": "Going to Seletar Airport is relatively easy with taxi but coming back from Seletar Airport is an issue if you are travelling with a baby or toddler since Grab are usually not an option or very limited drivers with child seat etc. Taxi was non existence and there is only a long winding bus service 102 that can bring you to Sengkang MRT after a 35 mins bus ride. The staff at the airport was very helpful though. However, i think the transportation options need to be improve or ramp up to make travelling from this airport to town easier with more taxis around at least",
