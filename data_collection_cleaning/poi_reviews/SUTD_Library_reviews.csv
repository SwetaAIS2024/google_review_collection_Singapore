Pramodya Abeysinghe,5,Built with nice architecture and ambience with modern concepts. Not only books and dvds as in an ordinary library. You can learn about architecture related things. For an example about different surfaces samples are stored in one section. You can study them there it self. Also lot of iMacs are provided all over the library. Enough free space for individuals or groups to work.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113072076899471931051/reviews
