ee edgar,5,As good as I remember it to be. I miss their noodles though. Char siew somehow tastes different when it is eaten with noodles. Wish they would bring back their noodles.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100166282174948557463/reviews
C K Leong (Ah Leong San),5,"Since the owners decided to reopen here, I haven’t been here. Standard is still good. I ordered the 3 in 1 - roast duck, roast pork and char siew rice. All three items are still good. Charcoal roasted is always better. Roasted duck and pork skins are crispy and I love the char siew not too sweet ❤️ Stall opens every Tuesdays to Saturdays from 11 am till sold out.

Second visit to try roasted duck drumstick and roasted pork. Yummy! Pity I forgot to ask for sauce on the duck. Would have made it better.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108882315597576503809/reviews

Alvin Mah,5,"One of the most popular stalls in this hawker centre. Always have a 10 to 20mins queue during meal hours. Tried the $8 plate that comes with all 3 combinations (duck, roasted pork and char siew). All 3 meats were perfectly roasted over charcoal and very tender. The duck's skin is slightly crispy and not too fat. Roasted pork wise, you can hear the cunchy sounds when chewing on the skin. My favourite is the char siew. Well marinated, not too sweet and with the right balance of fatty and lean meat in every slice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101731562623200370370/reviews
Jowy ljm,5,"Really nice. Especialy the duck hase crispy skin and soft tender meat when i tried the duck drum stick.
The char siew and roast meat is ver nice too . Standard is there sweet and savoury well balanced.
Chilli is nice too,match with the meat and the fragrance rice. Rice is not crumpy, well separated grain by grain.
Char siew abit fatty. Can ask for less fatty portion next visit.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118224515482176766573/reviews
