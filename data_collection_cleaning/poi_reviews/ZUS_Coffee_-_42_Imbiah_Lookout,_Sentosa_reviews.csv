Juli Effendy,4,"The environment inside is nice with cold air conditioning because outside very hot. We ordered 4 drinks
- Spanish latte
- creme Spanish latte
The coffee is a bit too sweet for regular sugar. Coffee smoky. Base too much condensed milk (3/5)

- roasted oolong milk tea
Ordinary (3/5)
- green tea latte
Ordinary (3/5)

Service not so friendly especially the cashier staff. I actually ordered less sweet for all drinks but one of my drinks are regular sweet.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112179605402780535380/reviews
Ms Dior,5,"I'd love to say that today was better than yesterday! I love the atmosphere here - it's very cool and relaxing, making it a perfect spot to unwind. Today, the staff finally attended to me, and I'd like to give a special mention to Bella, who was very friendly and attentive. She truly made my experience enjoyable. Compared to yesterday, when the staff seemed rather ignorant and slow, today's service was a pleasant surprise. Good job! I hope you maintain this level of service moving forward, as it would really make a big difference in keeping customers happy and loyal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102657063918158157170/reviews
Bella Yasin,3,"I order 2 frappes on 22/3/25 around evening for break fasting, 1x Double choc chip and 1 x Caramel Cream Frappe.

I've order at Zus Coffee Imbiah multiple times after it opened the outlet and I had no problem.. today I discover on my caramel drink, and found a freaking NAIL in my drink.. I got disgusted and threw it away.. and the both drinks were melted before I even drink it..",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105236851366402631276/reviews
Lisa Smith,1,"Went here yesterday to get a coffee. Was disappointed.
Service was terrible and slow. The lady at the till stood counting the till for ages and didn't look up to acknowledge us (was about 1030am).
The coffee i did get was revolting and I ended up throwing 90% of it out.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114033742078454282051/reviews
