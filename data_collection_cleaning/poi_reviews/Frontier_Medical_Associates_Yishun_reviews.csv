YeoJung,5,"I have visited many GPs over the years, and Dr. Goh truly stands out. She is knowledgeable, patient, caring, and approachable. Because of her excellent care, I have been recommending my family and friends to see her whenever they need a doctor.

The clinic staff—Jiale, Nicole, and Ivy—are always polite, pleasant, and helpful. A special shout-out to Jiale! Even on days when the queue is long, they proactively accommodate patients’ needs, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience. Highly recommended!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105793786783311098034/reviews

Toto Supantamart,5,"I came here for a vaccination. Generally, GP clinics are always crowded, and the staff can be stressed, so they don't say much to everyone. This clinic, on the other hand, is busy, but the staff and nurses are very friendly and caring despite having many patients. I really like their positive attitude and what they say to make the patient feel at ease. I'm really impressed with the quality of service provided. Thank you so much!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105817595376566293088/reviews
Yew Jia-Ming,5,"I recently visited this clinic for my booster shot and was super impressed by the friendliness of the nurses and doctor. Covid-19 vaccination is conducted at level 2, the first door on your right once you come out of the lift, while general consultation is at level 1. Doctor is super skillful too, I didn't feel any pain at all while getting the shot. Highly recommended.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106888924214194543500/reviews
