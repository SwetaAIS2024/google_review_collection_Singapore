There are much better 2nd hand bookstores in Bras Basah to spend your time.",

The book itself is in a good condition, the one thing I REALLY don't like about it is the fact that THEY PUT ON STICKERS DIRECTLY ON THE BOOK. Both at the front and the back. Getting rid of the sticker and glue residue is not a very fun thing to do. I risk scratching the matte coated cover. Putting your store stickers on rare/collectable/antique books (which is what your store is all about) IS A BAD IDEA. Why your management think it's a good idea to do this IS BEYOND ME.",
