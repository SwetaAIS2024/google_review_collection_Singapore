MatadorToro Smith,4,"Went to the Tanjong Katong branch. The selection of dishes are great and fresh.  The rice and chilli is just ok, rice can be more fragrant, chilli can be a tad sweeter. Must have is the ikan bilis and chicken wings. Queue is long but wait is not too bad but ordering process can be improved if customers can have a better view what they are ordering. Some have to order at the counter where you can't really see the dishes.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113438146470633102933/reviews

Jessica Choo,1,Unfriendly aunty who served. Busy talking about previous customer ( who ordered 1 plate to share). Not even her business. Ended up giving me and my bf such a minion portion of brinjal. Very unhappy. Portion not so little in the past. The only thing she gave alot was the chili!,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105733929404831151020/reviews
Jerome Rodrigues,1,"$6 for this and a sour puss grump attitude by the staff… I think I will bring my business elsewhere given that this nasi lemak chain is now getting too big for its britches… food is also meh/mid whatever you want to call it, its not something thats to die for so better to just eat at better nasi lemak spots… thank you next",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102062087068239309803/reviews
Teck Boon,5,Food standard at this location is always consistent. Service is prompt and efficient and tables are cleaned quickly to ensure that people will always be able to find a table soon. Slightly more expensive than other nasi lemak store but quality is good and that’s why there’s always a queue for food. It also means things are always fresh and hot.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105978834231481267643/reviews
