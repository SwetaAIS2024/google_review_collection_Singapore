Just a friendly reminder for not to expect much assistance from the staff, it is mostly self service so you need know what you are looking for.",

When I tried to provide feedback on a defective item, the cashiers were unprofessional and unhelpful. Unfortunately, my attempts to contact the manager/owner, Mr. Winston, via email and phone calls were met with silence.\n\nTurtle tanks are leaking water even though the brand new unit in their shop is leaking and yet they continue to sell it to customers even after being aware of it.",
