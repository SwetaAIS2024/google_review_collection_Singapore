Alisha Saini,5,"I sent my daughter to playgroup when she was just 2 years old, and the experience has been wonderful. The teachers (special thanks to Teacher Shi Ling) were incredibly kind, patient, and attentive in helping my daughter adapt to the new environment. Their warmth and dedication made the transition so much smoother for my daughter.

What I truly appreciate is how well they keep me informed about my daughter’s progress and activities. Whether it’s addressing concerns or sharing updates, they communicate regularly through WhatsApp and the school app, which gives me great peace of mind.

The school also organizes a variety of events and activities that keep the children engaged and excited about learning. As a first-time mum, it’s such a relief to know that my daughter is in a nurturing and supportive environment where she is well cared for. Thank you to the entire team for making this such a positive experience for both of us!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102086987219812373092/reviews
Abhilasha Atha,5,"I would like to express my sincere appreciation towards the staff at the infant care. As a first time parent, I was very nervous and anxious about sending my child at the 7.5 month mark. However, within a week I noticed him enjoying and that helped calm me a bit. Further, the teachers were very patient with us, and understood our anxiousness - regularly sharing pictures and being prompt with the chat responses. I am really grateful and would highly recommend Cherie Hearts Mountbatten.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112847549366706653712/reviews
Siau Ling Goh,5,"My kid has been attending Cherie Hearts since she was 10 months old. I appreciate how the teachers are always updating us timely regarding her progress and checking in with us if there’s any concerns. Also, the transition from infant care to playgroup was done seamlessly.

My kid also comes back from school having lots of stories to tell me and I can see that she enjoys her time in school. Really feel thankful to have my kid being in Cherie Hearts!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110227261883452701537/reviews
Shu Seow,5,"Both kids were at Cherie Hearts from infant care till K2 graduation. They had a fun filled adventure through the years - water play, hands on learning through artwork, pancake day, entrepreneur Day, Start small dream big projects, concerts, wushu, robotics, science experiments…. The balanced teaching methods were suitable for kids who preferred learning through play, allowing the kids to be curious and discover their interest.

The kids were also prepped adequately for Primary school education - learning about time, money, reading journals, confidence building, making new friends, learning to be independent, speaking about fears…

There was also strong partnership with the teachers through periodic updates and working with parents to bring out the best in the kids. We miss the CHMBT team, thank you for all that you have done for our family! ❤️",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108087052485829542820/reviews
Nor Izan,5,"I have send both my kids there since infant. Both my kids love it there. My first born already graduated from there last year and she said she missed Cherie hearts. The teachers are passionate and caring. The teachers and parents communication are also great and I get to know what my kids are doing or what they need to improve on. They have a lot of activities for the students as well.

I have a peace of mind when I send my kids there as the function room where the kids gather for play or activities are all made of top to bottom glass windows. So you can see you can see what your kids are doing.

Thanks to Cherie heart that my child able to transit well into P1 due to the dedication of the K2 teachers who prep her in the fun and enriching way.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110463303236666224685/reviews
