Both my son and daughter had the privilege of attending this incredible kindergarten, and they loved every minute of it. The teachers and staff are truly exceptional—caring, nurturing, and dedicated to each child's growth. The activities are engaging and fun, and the learning materials are thoughtfully selected to enhance the educational experience. I’m so grateful for the personalized attention and love my children received, making it a truly special place for them to learn and grow.",

      "text": "This is the best school you could hope for your child. It flies a bit under the radar and does not “brand” itself like Etonhouse or Odessey, but it is an institution in Singapore’s educational history.\n\nOur son went here starting 13 months all the way to graduation at age 6. He loved going to school and learnt much more than we could have expected. As an example, kids graduate from here being able to do mental math of two digit numbers (18x12) and their Chinese programme is fantastic - despite not being ethnically Chinese, our son speaks and loves the language as his own mother tongue. He is now taking it as his MTL in primary school where the teachers have been impressed with the foundation he has been given.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the culture of the school is fantastic. We felt at every instance like we had partners to help us raise our child - the teachers were always open to taking to us, and we resolved many of the behavioral toddler issues together. Kudos to Principal Irene who runs a really good school, and to all the teachers who are the best educators you can find. Look no further if you want the best education for your child.",

      "text": "Excellent teachers who strictly follow the Montessori method. All three of my children have benefited from studying at the MFC Newton. My youngest child (Nyra) just graduated last year and is now in a good primary school. The education she obtained at the Montessori has not only inspired a love for learning but has also put her in a good stead in primary one. She has a firm grasp of both mathematics as well as a good command of the English language. Importantly, she also has a firm knowledge of the world around her, from science to geography. Special thanks to the Montessori teachers like Sumathi, Yu Ting Lao Shih, Catherine, Dilani and more who have enriched Nyra’s life and instilled in her a lifelong love for learning! I can’t recommend this kindergarten enough!",

The older one will graduate with the school this year and we are grateful for the school’s preparations and support in getting him ready for primary school education.\n\nExperienced teaching staff and a solid Montessori curriculum provides children with a wonderful learning journey that works at their individual pace.\n\nA well structured and supportive learning environment full of engaging activities that works to develop children physically, socially, emotionally and cognitively.\n\nWould highly recommend the Montessori for Children as it takes a full Montessori approach as opposed to a few others with similar names in Singapore that doesn’t actually practice the methodology in full and therefore potentially loses its full intended impact.",
