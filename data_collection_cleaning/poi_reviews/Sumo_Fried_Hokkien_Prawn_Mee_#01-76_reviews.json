      "text": "AMK does have quite a number of amazing HKM stalls. Today I tried another one at 628 AMK market. Prawn stock was flavorful with some slight wok hei infused. I tasted lots of garlic and egg in the noodles, overall it was a nice blended ratio. Interestingly I see the chef added some crunchy anchovies on top of the noodles.\n\nThere's also quite a few supporters, apparently they make a mean fried carrot cake too.\n\nThere's my top tier Ho Ji and Ah Jie, this shall be the next AMK tier, joining the ranks of Eng Ho and Zhen Jie. Can order if you are nearby and need a HKM fix.",

The stall owner saw & immediately took my plate of food & throw away. He gave me another fresh plate complimentary. Kind gesture from the stall owner.",
