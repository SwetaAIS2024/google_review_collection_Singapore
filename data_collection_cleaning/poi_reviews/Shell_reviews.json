Nothing too special about them vs the others that you'd find around the area.\n\nIf any, it's a very hard-to-find petrol kiosk, and it's not difficult to miss seeing them if you're coming from Tiong Bahru side of things, because of the overhead bridge blocking the logo whilst driving. You'd need to be intentional to find them here; passed by this road so many times over, but never knew they were here.",
