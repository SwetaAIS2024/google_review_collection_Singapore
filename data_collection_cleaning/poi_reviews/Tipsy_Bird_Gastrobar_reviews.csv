Faye D,4,"We sat at the al fresco bar height tables for dinner and first impression was it was comfortable on a not so humid evening. But when the band started playing, we immediately felt so overwhelmed by the loud speakers blasting in our direction. Lucky for us, we had very friendly staff who attended to all our requests, especially in lowering the volume of the speakers which they were already trying to fix before we even made a complaint. If I could give 6 stars for service, I would.

Food wise, not a big fan of truffle oil, which was in their fries, but I did like the way it was crunchy outside and soft inside. Assam Seafood Fried Rice with crab was very tasty. We also ordered Garlic Prawns Aglio Olio, Prawn Paste Chicken Wings and Fermented Pork Belly with Garlic. Cap the night off with 2 Burnt Cheesecakes with Ice cream on the side. Everything was bold in flavour which paired well with a pint of beer. Unlimited water is also available for $2 per person. The tapas dishes were meant to be shared and are $26 for 2. I didn‚Äôt take photos of al the dishes, too busy chatting üòÖ.

Overall a good dinner experience only made more pleasant by the gracious service staff.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117512748362444652085/reviews
David Oon,4,"Decent Value For Money Lunch Promo (1 for 1)

Took advantage of the 1-1 promo and ordered the 6 different lunch mains. While the portion size is on the small side, all 6 fusion mains tasted decently good. Fish and chips are crispy. My fav was the assam chicken skewer with fried rice! Tasty piquant fried rice that is sufficiently savory, while the chicken bites were tender and well grilled.

Service was fast and ambience conducive for lunch and team chat.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111461636018977333111/reviews
Angie Wee,4,"1 for 1 lunch offer is good but limited choices. Our vote is the Fried Hor Fan! Joshua is very friendly, enjoyed talking to him more than the food üòÄ",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103965704183967143998/reviews
Janchicsiken,3,"Ordered an assortment of dishes for 5 pax.  Oysters were adequately fresh, rojak fish skin was interesting, star of the show was surprisingly the Cajun fries - fried to perfection and seasoning was delectable.

Truffle moonlight horfun was too watery and truffle taste too light to make much of an impact. Beef was good though, will try the sirloin steak next time. The rest of the food items were average at best. The food probably needed drinks to go with, unfortunately it was lunchtime and all of us had places to be.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110122050620611948477/reviews
Yean L,5,1st time here and had a wonderful meal. Doneness of sirloin steak was perfect with yummy truffle sauce. Service staff were bubbly. Kai was very friendly and checked on me to ensure everything was in good order. Burnt cheese cake was fantastic way to end off the meal üòç Live music to enjoy after work.
