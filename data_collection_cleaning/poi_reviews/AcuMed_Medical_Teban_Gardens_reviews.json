      "text": "i called to make an appointment booking and was asked to walk-in. when reached the registration counter, was asked if I made an appointment booking. I told the staff that I called the week before but was asked to walk in. poor queue management controls with patients randomly cutting over from registration to dispensary queue line for registration. x-ray unit broke down (unavailable for the whole week) and was only informed at the front desk during registration to be diverted to the nearest Taman Jurong branch which is 24 mins' bus journey away. patients were not informed of next step after one station to the other at all times, information was not well communicated. worse part was doctor on duty (Dr Amy Lestari Kaonang (M14667F)) that day failed to listen to patient and I had to clarify and repeat myself several times as she did not get the chronological order of events and details correctly to document them in the medical database. as expected, I got my medical report one day after and wrong information was documented in my medical record. in addition, during consultation, she demanded for my other medical reports from other institutions to send to her that I declined. forcing patients to disclose personal medical information is unprofessional.",

Price compare to others medical chain are lower.\nStaff here is friendly.\nOpens at 8.30am, reached here 9.30am and there's a long queue (waiting time approximately 1 hour).\nCounter staff respond fast and efficient. Nearby has hawker, convenient stall etc. Can grab a bite or coffee if your wait is long.\nNearby has no MRT station, option only to take bus.\nMedical check are standard base on your requirements. Process are fuss free as the nurse will guide you alone.\nGood visit",

Probably that‚Äôs why we need more foreign employees.\n\nThere‚Äôs still a very long queue waiting to get their queue number for doctor‚Äôs consultation.\n\nJust a word of advice for future employees going for their health check up. Do inform ur HR about my review and see if you can get a change in clinic for ur health check up.\n\nGreat day!",
