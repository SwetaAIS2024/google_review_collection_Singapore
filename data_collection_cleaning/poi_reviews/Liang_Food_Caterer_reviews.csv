Adele for HIM,5,"I’ve been working with Liang Food Catering for over a year, and they’ve consistently exceeded my expectations. We've ordered full buffet setups and bentos, and the food is always delicious, and the portions are generous. I've received excellent feedback from the attendees of our Saturday classes. The ordering process is simple, and they always go above and beyond to accommodate last-minute changes. Even their delivery team is friendly and helpful. I highly recommend them to anyone asking for a catering suggestion. Thank you, Liang!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104521889660002598176/reviews

Grace Li,4,"Ordered standard buffet for 30pax on 22 July for kid birthday celebration. The foods came nice and fresh. The only sad part was the portion of the stir fry broccoli with cauliflower oyster sauce was not sufficient.

I would recommend their crabbites fried rice, sweet and sour fish, Chicken curry and chocolate eclair.

Worth the price and will definitely order again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112810439142314282000/reviews
dinesh raja,5,"Had their bento meal, localised menu, for my office for the past few months . Their service was excellent no doubt. Food was generally excellent, at times a little oily on certain dishes / menu . Otherwise really value for the money .recommend",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333701698590689681/reviews
