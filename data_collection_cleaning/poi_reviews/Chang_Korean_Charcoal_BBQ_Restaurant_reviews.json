Comparing to this to Hanjip, meat quality is comparable but this one has the seafood option, I prefer Hanjip cold noodles but Chang has a better Ginseng chicken soup. Chang has marinated crab which my wife love, beverage are better at Chang too. Good environment and service, without the time limit that Hanjip imposes. I guess Chang is now my goto for quality Kbbq.",
