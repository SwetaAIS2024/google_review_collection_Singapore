Olivia H,5,"An unforgettable stay at an iconic landmark!

The grounds and architecture are absolutely stunning — rich with history yet immaculately maintained. The interiors are just as impressive, blending heritage charm with modern comfort. Staff were warm, professional, and attentive throughout.

A special shout-out to Vikram the doorman at the entrance — he was so friendly and even remembered our names throughout the stay. We were really impressed by his hospitality.

It was such a cool experience to stay somewhere so iconic, and I was pleasantly surprised by how modern and luxurious the facilities were (even the bathrooms!). A perfect mix of old-world elegance and contemporary ease.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103932089965773867525/reviews
Sze Mei NG,5,"A historic luxury hotel in Singapore. Grand and elegant. Established in the heart of CBDin 1887.
Classic 19th century British-colonial architectural style and design - White-washed walls, symmetry, ornate wooden detailing, high ceiling, and wide verandas. Relaxing lawn. So beautiful. Like a palace.
Shopping at the Raffle arcade.
Not hard to find clean toilets.
Famous Singapore Sling at Long Bar. Afternoon tea at the Grand Lobby, but no live music, unfortunately.
Professional staff.
Nice experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110691822088620237996/reviews
Alexandra K,5,"Everyone was fantastic! The doormen always welcomed me home during my stay, the butlers personalized my care, and the concierge desk went above and beyond to help me. The room was clean and comfortable and easy to personalize with the tablet. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. I loved my time here. I will definitely book again when I visit Singapore.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105125209328645609509/reviews
Brooke Lee,5,"This was our second stay at Raffles Singapore - and the “Grand Dame” did not disappoint.
Could not fault anything - the service, accomodation, food, the pool - everything was absolutely outstanding, as you would expect from such a fine hotel.
Only one small criticism, please put a manual light switch by the bed for the bedside lamps, having to navigate the iPad in the middle of the night to turn them on is challenging !
We usually split our time in Singapore between the Swissotel Stamford and Raffles, after this most recent stay, our “home” in Singapore will be Raffles.
We can’t wait to return again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103931820990871172331/reviews
Manav Salwan,5,"Splendid location and service. Enjoyed the Sling at the Long Bar and the mesmerizing tour of MacAllan whiskey. Historic location with a great variety of luxurious shops. Harpeeet the doorman was very warm, kind and directed us on our way. He is an excellent asset to Raffles.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110767199699572708871/reviews
