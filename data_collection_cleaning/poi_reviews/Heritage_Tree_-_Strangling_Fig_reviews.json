      "text": "This is part of the Heritage Trees at Changi Walking Trail, tree no 8.\nA strangling fig starts life in the canopy of its host tree. It then extends its aerial roots downwards which progressively surround the hostâ€™s trunk,\nwhich cannot grow and eventually dies. The fig also shades the host by extending its canopy above that of the host tree.\nFicus stricta is a rare lowland rainforest species. Its figs ripen to a purplish red and attract many feeding birds.",
