Fenny Ong,1,"Bayshore MRT to underpass to Beach reviews

Not really a calm area underpass before I could walk to the tunnel spotted a brown wild dogs 🐕 while coming out of Bayshore Exit 2 need to walk from TEL Line something frustrated 😣 thing is they should put a huge sign 🪧 to remind this station end at Bayshore very confusing I had to ask security at the nearest condo guardhouse guards in white & blue attire they were more helpful to direct me I am very touch & thankful to them whoever they are God blessed you boys. MRT guys just said I have to go into the condo where it’s a dead road no thru road sia. 🥲 TEL line is super slow to Garden By The Bay if you in a rush omg than snail 🐌 minister please do something about it thank you 🙏",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111064721628126133898/reviews
