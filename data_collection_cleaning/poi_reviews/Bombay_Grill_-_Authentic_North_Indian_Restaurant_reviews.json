      "text": "Vegetarian Only Review:\n\nFood: One of the bad Veg Biryani I had. The vegetables used are frozen one's and the rice also doesn't tastes good in terms of their flavor. Probably one can get better elsewhere for the price.\nThe veg gravy given for biryani is also a frozen one and not prepared fresh on the day as I felt it cold while having it.\nThe onion pakoda isn't good too, I felt that the flour used probably is a freezed one and didn't taste good, I had good one's before so this isn't good.\n\nThe carrot halwa is not that bad and not super nice either. It is just ok.\n\nGood: The lime soda was perfect ðŸ‘Œ, it was one of the best lime soda I've had recently.\n\nStaff: I placed a grab takeaway order and the staff was kind enough to allow me have the food in the restaurant.\n\nAmbience: It's like any other typical restaurant, nothing fanciful.\n\nYou can read my other contributions. So to say this is totally an unbiased review.",
