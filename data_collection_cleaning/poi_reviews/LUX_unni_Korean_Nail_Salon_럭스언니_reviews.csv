Inss Pk,4,"The kids wanted to do their nails, so I went there.
First of all, you treated the children very kindly and friendly, so the shy children were able to have a great time without feeling uncomfortable.

My first child bites his nails, so after a long consultation, he added tips and colored them to reflect my child's needs. It was done so beautifully, and my child really likes it.
The youngest child is also very pretty and cute.
You have now become our children’s “Aunt Nail’s favorite!” haha.

I'm going to go get a pedi soon, gun gun 😁",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105431634709201159631/reviews
만년어터,5,"I was worried because my nails were very small and ugly, but they made them look really pretty.
I have very dark hands, but they did a great job of matching the colors well.
I feel so good every time I look at my nails or type.
I think I will be using it regularly in the future.
May you prosper~",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101210051340032954129/reviews
