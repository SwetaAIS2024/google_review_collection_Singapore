Jacqueline Tang,5,"The team is very responsive, helped and guided us a great deal even before the funeral. They have been there every step of the way guiding and instructing us what to do and expect.
The package covers all needs from the beginning to the last send off. Every little needs and requirements are looked into.
The team is even ready to hand out tissue to family members. Such a simple act but it shows that they are extremely sensitive to the family needs and atmosphere.
Set up for the wake is elegant and professional. We were informed of the timing of every step from the set up and tear down.
Our family appreciates and thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the superb professional service!!
Lastly thank you too for upgrading the hearse to the Maserati. It gives great dignity to the deceased.
Special shout out to Eugene the funeral director assigned. We appreciate your service.
Thank you, Elson for the complimentary coffee machine. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114470128962233176822/reviews

Genesha Jessie,5,"Dear Serenity Team
Thank you for making the funeral / wake service very beautiful. Especially with the upgrade to Maserati,
a dignified and honoured last ride for my father.
Serenity did such a wonderful and exceptional job ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you for all of the directions and support given to my family and myself when organizing all the funeral arrangements.
It took a lot of pressure from us during this difficult period,
From the time I started pre planning with Elson and team
communication was very smooth and effective,
Jacky was assigned to oversee the whole process, he handled professionally and always ready to answer all our questions, he showed a lot of respect, empathy and gave emotional support to our grieving family. He kept checking on us if we were okay
those made our day better.
We were truly touched by the service that was rendered to us and I would strongly say that I have chosen the right and best Casket company for my dad we will definitely recommend your service to others
Once again
From the bottom of our hearts we are very thankful and grateful to Serenity for making this Memorable last journey of our late dad. üôèüôèüôèüôè

Richard Tan,5,"The level of service by Serenity Funeral Service is superb. From the time of activation until the time that the funeral service is over, the physical and spiritual support was endless. Their punctuality and guidance throughout was truly commendable, as this was my first time organising a funeral for a loved one. We have been greatly blessed by their services. We only needed to call them and inform them our need when my brother passed away. They were able to effectively advise and recommended suitable funeral package according to our financial ability. All the necessary bookings for the funeral wake to the cremation and ash management were fully organised from start to finish. Their logistical partner also gave their full support and set up the wake location within 2 hours, and the wake went full steam thereafter. My family and I were deeply grateful for their seamless support, making our difficult time more bearable.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116792768505777895283/reviews
