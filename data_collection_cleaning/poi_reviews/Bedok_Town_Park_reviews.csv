Meng Fai Yip,4,"Bedok Town Park is a narrow but long strip of park space between Bedok North MRT Station and Bedok Reservoir MRT Station, and parallel to the PIE. There is a Dog Run, an Allotment Garden, and a Play Corridor; and I saw at least 4 pedestrian bridges linking the park to the HDB flats across the PIE. If not for the noise of the vehicles coming from the expressway, I would say that it is an excellent park to be in. Certainly envy the residents staying in those blocks just next to the park.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238839349859158213/reviews
Yingying,4,Small but nice park to bring your pets out for a walk. Thereâ€™s a dog run area and you can bring your dogs there. Though you have to be careful because there are lots of red ants around the trees.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117289079780130956871/reviews
