      "text": "The best drink stall in the neighbourhood. I normally order kopiccino from them - a special drink with kopi base and pulled milk foam. It's very interesting to see how the barista pulled the milk to make foam for this drink - I can tell that he's extremely proud of his skill too. You can also request the sugar level and he will accommodate your request - pretty good service for a neighbourhood drink stall.\n\nThey are the only drink stall with sugarcane juice in the cluster - very fresh and great taste sugarcane, squeezed on request. They also have a big menu with interesting items to try. Highly recommended.",
