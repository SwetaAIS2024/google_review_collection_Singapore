Jeff,5,"Had one of the best experience at Vacheron Constantin MBS this evening with Mr Win and Mr Jonathan. Visited the outlet couple of times over a month period and the service and professionalism was nothing short of amazing. I have been to different watch boutiques and owned multiple time pieces but VC left the deepest impression, by far.

VC staffs was exceptionally knowledgeable, patient, and attentive throughout my visit. Their passion for watches and commitment to customer satisfaction really left a lasting impression.

VC Singapore, you have a gem of a staff here. I wish your staffs all the best in their career and thank you once again for sharing your watch knowledge and allowing me to try on some of the amazing timepieces. I'll definitely be back again to purchase from VC soon.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117496197995685866838/reviews

Lastly, I cannot express enough thanks to Johnathan for his invaluable insights and advice during the watch collection process. His expertise and passion for horology shone through as he shared his knowledge with me, making the experience truly unforgettable. It was evident that Johnathan genuinely cared about ensuring that I was satisfied with my purchase, and for that, I am incredibly grateful.

In sum, my sojourn at the MBS boutique was nothing short of sublime.

"Hai Hoe, Damien Toh",5,"Stepped into the boutique on 30 April and was greeted by Edwin who was very polite and helpful. I asked about the possibility of putting my name in the queue for the 7900V Dual Time Black Dial and he promptly answered my query and asked me for my particulars in order to process my request. I tried on an exhibition piece too and spent about 30 mins in the boutique. Edwin made me felt very welcomed. Later in the afternoon, I received a WhatsApp from Ms Fiona Yang who confirmed that she will keep me posted once the watch is ready for collection. Iâ€™m excited and eager to start my first purchase with Vacheron Constantin MBS",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104196782164860276852/reviews
