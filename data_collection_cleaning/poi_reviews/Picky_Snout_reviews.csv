Super Fragrance,5,"Saigon pork cost $12.50. Cream of mushroom chicken plus egg cost $11

Godly
Saigon pork. Super tender super flavorful. The most tender grilled pork I have

That sour sauce. Elevates the taste of everything it touches from rosti to pork and chicken.

Pros
Rosti crispy and mildly savory very enjoyable.

They can fried their sunny side up to just right doneness

Meh
Grilled chicken was average. Creamy mushroom looks good but don't have umami or savory to it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
Ray Tan,4,Rosti stall situated in a heartlander kopitiam of Kovan. Service is alittle slow and prices abit on the high side given that it’s kopitiam. And this kopitiam in the past i always avoid one cause it’s so damn stuffy. Ordered the creamy mushroom chicken rosti($11). I like that it comes with a side of greens. Chicken is nicely grilled and pairs well with the cream sauce. Rosti is relatively crispy not nua like some really lousy ones i had in pasar malam. Overall not too bad.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118226053308108066808/reviews
Matty Matt,3,"I used to visit the previous outlet before they moved. But now the chicken chop seem to be fried first before grilled but last time it was grilled nicely.
Rosti was still good and crispy and much better than other shops!
But the additional sausage cost $5.90 and was so small in size and miserable. It was too overpriced for me",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106100646244225914158/reviews
Han Nguyen,5,"Ordered the Signature Saigon Pork Belly with Rice - a great find!

The Saigon fish sauce served alongside tasted authentically like the one I had back in my hometown.

The pork belly was grilled to perfection - juicy with a nice charred flavor.

Price: $8.90 - reasonable considering the quality and coffee shop setting (non-aircon).",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112411885473092127811/reviews
Daryl Tan,3,The experience was disappointing.  Their prices were expensive and food was mediocre.  Rosti was burnt at sides and sunny side up egg was dry.  Sausage was small for the price.  Much better versions at Buddy Hoagies or Marche for a bit more cost.  Will give it a hard miss for the future,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117964415942272145603/reviews
