Joydip Sinha,4,Reasonable set of food and drink offerings at a convenient location close to the Gardens by the bay. The breakfast set menu is good. Staff are generally helpful but appear a bit less in detail when some enquiries are done. Overall a reasonable food experience and good ambience.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101100381196038602735/reviews

DAFFODILUK,1,"My favourite Starbucks drink is Java Chlp frappuccino but today's drink does not taste good at all. It lacks in flavours, just sweet and cream taste only. So disappointed.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106554697224261164876/reviews
Tâm Anthony,1,"The worst Starbucks ever!

I dont know why Starbucks still runs this business in one of the most popular attractions like Garden by the Bay!
The staffs are literally ruin this place with zero welcoming, didnt give a freaking care to our orders, talked loudly to each other, tossed left over to the sink violently which shocked us!

Please do something or just basically remove the Starbucks sign to avoid disparaging the brand!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103276245302747623908/reviews
