Jinjja ones uses fresh chickens hence don’t carry that distinctive “frozen” aftertaste. The pulut hitam nasi lemak is an absolute gem of a creation! Got to try, heard it’s limited time on the menu.",

The other staff there were great as well. The food was so nice, it came with a glove so it didn't get too messy. I wish I lived closer so I could come all the time",

Thank goodness for the sauce, which helped to cushion away the salt taste.\n\nThere were ample seats when I went there at 5pm on a Saturday evening, though i did a takeaway, and the male counter staff was very helpful by recommending what to eat.\n\nI think it was a good fast food joint but not somewhere I would eat daily.\n\nIf it is any importance, they accept \"shopback\" payment, that was another reason why I ate there",
