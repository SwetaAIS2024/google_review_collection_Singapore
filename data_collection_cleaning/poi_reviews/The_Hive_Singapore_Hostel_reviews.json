      "text": "Stayed here for three nights as a solo traveler . This is a great location for very reasonable price. The rooms are quite clean. There is a huge cat üêà‚Äç‚¨õ like a guardian, if you're a cat lover, ha ha.\n\nOne girl in the staff is very nice (wearing specs) , but there's another mean lady who is strict and disregarded me even at check-in. The customer service can definitely be improved.\n\nThey have unlimited tea and coffee, but no breakfast\n\nYou can walk around little India even at night. The Neighbourhood is very safe. There's a great seafood restaurant right in front which is open throughout 24 hours. Cute caf√©s and restaurants are abundant in the area if you are a food lover.\n\nThey have a washing machine and an iron , clean bathrooms, showers and sinks. The sleeping pods are pretty spacious. They have a charging point, a table, a mirror and a cool light.",

The aircon is off from 3am to 7pm. There's big fan but still bit hot.\n\nThere's free coffee and tea all day, refrigerator, microwave and hot water free to used but clean up after yourself.\n\nThe shower, toilet, and wastafel is clean. They provide towel, shampoo, and soap.\n\nWorth the price, very nice stay. Just need to be careful when moving in the pod, its quite small, and its plastic, so it makes noise.",
