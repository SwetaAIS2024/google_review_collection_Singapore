      "text": "Dear Desigual Customer Service Team,\n\nI am writing to express my disappointment with the customer service I received from the Desigual store at Vivo City. As a regular customer, I was shocked when I could not get through the line for more than 1 hour.\n\nI urgently needed to return an item, but unfortunately, no one answered the phone. I then contacted the Desigual store at ION, where I received exceptional service from the staff. Ms. Shafiqua and Ms. Azura were extremely helpful and went above and beyond to resolve my issue within a 5-minute call.\n\nI hope that Desigual HQ will look into the customer service at Vivo City to improve their responsiveness and service quality.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.",

Instead of willingly showing us, she ‚Äúwarned‚Äù us first that the bag is priced over $100 and no discount given !! Amazing!! Didn‚Äôt realise this time of attitude and service still exists in Singapore.",

But for what it's worth, I feel happy when I walk into the store. üòä Clothes are generally comfortable but require a bit more care - basically, hand-wash instead of dumping them into the washer. DON'T come here because I don't want everyone to start wearing the same brand :( (kidding, please support them!)",
