      "text": "Passed by this store and felt like trying it. I ordered the grilled chicken burrito, fries and ice lemon tea. The fries are crispy and nice, the burrito is nice but it tasted a bit burnt and a little too salty. I wanted to order from the qr code but it  doesn't seem to be working I tried on two tables but nope. When the guy served my food, he said that my fries aren't ready so I have to wait, I am fine with that but then he took the number away from me as he walked away which then led to the other server not knowing who the fries belonged to. Here is my suggestion, maybe leave the number there until the food is fully served?",

      "text": "I recently visited Guzman Y Gomez at Westgate and had a fantastic experience! The food was absolutely delicious, and I love how fresh everything tasted. The staff were really friendly and helpful, making the whole experience even better. I went for their burrito bowl, and it did not disappoint—packed with flavor and generous portions. The atmosphere was lively but still relaxed, which made it a great spot to grab a bite. I’ll definitely be back soon! Highly recommend if you're in the area and craving tasty Mexican food!",
