WL Ang,5,Tenderloin and pork collar were yummy and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e was a nice touch to end dinner. Service staff were attentive and it was not too noisy or crowded. We enjoyed our space with soothing music.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111918152226800415131/reviews
Max Boh,4,"Brought wife over for 17 yrs anniversary. First time going so when we saw there was an empty table we were quite happy. However a lady behind us cut in requesting for table for 5, which was then dealt with first by another waitress and resulted in us being ushered outdoors by the waiter who had guided us indoors. Both of them did apologise but it's like, ma'am, two humans in front of you but you are paying attention to the one cutting in from behind and leaving your colleague stuck in between...?
Since we were both short on time and didn't want to spoil the mood there and then we went ahead with lunch.
Food was ok until towards the end I've no idea how an insect wing landed near my plate. Probably from the fan on the floor behind us.
If you ask me, going for the food time to time is ok. That's abt it.
Thumbs up to the waiter that initially served us though. Few follows the SFA guide on mask wearing while dishing food nowadays. We are more particular on this due to certain reasons.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101598776379302835322/reviews

Rosemary GE,5,"Highly recommend tamahawk! Super tender and juicy! If you can eat spicy food then you must try spicy seafood aglio olio! It is different from other spicy aglio olio I have ever eaten!
All of the dishes we ordered were very nice! I definitely will go back to eat for my third visitðŸ˜†",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100918822124817611988/reviews
