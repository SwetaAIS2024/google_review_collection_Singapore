Hanja H,5,"Katong is my favorite suburb of Singapore. Vibrant, great street cafés, bars and restaurants for every taste, incredible shopping places such as small boutiques and shops with rare fashion, vintage accessories for decorating or for all sorts f  hobbies.  Vinyl LPs with many different music-genres for every taste and flea markets with antic and vintage treasures beyond imagination. This part of Singapore makes you feel as being in old Asia / China and so much  fun to walk for hours exploring architecture and a flair which  modern cities are lacking.
I highly recommend Katong to anyone who is sick of mainstream.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104772461424486576304/reviews

April D iskan,5,"I recently dined at little farm katong cafe, and I was thoroughly impressed by the service provided by our crew server, Mrs Ruby. She were incredibly attentive, frequently checking in to ensure my drink were refilled and my needs were met. The knowledge of Mrs Rudy had about the menu helped me make delicious choices, and her warm demeanor added to the cozy atmosphere of the place. It was a busy night, yet Mrs Ruby made sure my evening was special. I highly recommend visiting Little Farm Katong for not only the excellent food but the outstanding service.” Thank You Ruby you are outstanding with such lovely smile. Feel like home away from home.  Ruby please continue your service with little farm katong otherwise i believe the number of customers will surely reduce.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108124219391253605117/reviews

Stephane H,5,"Loved the brunch and ambience in this place, at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, the one time I went with my then girlfriend, there was an orderly evacuation to the street due to a fire alarm (a small kitchen fire on second floor, no injuries fortunately) which soured up my relationship with this person since, because I didn't hold her hand on the way out. It's an anecdote more telling about the relationship though, than about this nice place.

Recommended for weekend brunch, though it can get busy, arrive early to get a table.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103963437892554802025/reviews
