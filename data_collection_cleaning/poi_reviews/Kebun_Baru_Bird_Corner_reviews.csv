Forest BK,5,"🦅It's very fascinating to hear so many birds singing and chirping away.
🐦‍⬛And to witness such a vast number of birds of various species at one place. That's Amazing.
🐦During weekends, members of the Kebun Bahru Bird Singing Club, mostly seniors, gathered here with their caged birds to display them, listen to their calls, appreciating, evaluating and comparing with others around them.
🐦🐦‍⬛The entire area explodes into a concert of bird singing serenade.
🦅🐦🦜The birds are mostly Chinese hwamei, red-whiskered bulbul, Indian white-eyes and white-rumped shamas.
Very lively, very mesmerising.
🐧At scheduled periods, the Club organise Bird Singing Competitions.
🐦‍⬛Sadly, this once popular hobby had lose it shine with younger folks.
🦅When we loose this heritage, we loose a part of our cultural legacy.
