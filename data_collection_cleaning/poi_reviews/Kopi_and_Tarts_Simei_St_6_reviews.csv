Nick,5,"Omg. Can believe I didn't try this before. It is so so so good. My family and I ordered the Hainanese curry R1 and the Merak Curry R3 . The first is so so delicious and the second has the sweet and savoury that is well balanced. Can't decide which I like more.

Really hits the spot. Highly recommend! And the utensils are super clean which I appreciate",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103527161898281171382/reviews
