We decided to give it a try since it was not too far from where we were suppose to be going.\n\nSurprisingly there was no queue when we got there at 12.30pm in a Saturday. We ordered up some economic bee hoon with different ingredients.\n\nEverything tasted amazing! It was not too oily like some places. The best part was the chilli, it is a bit sweet and went very well with everything.\n\nIâ€™ll definitely recommend this place for a quick and cheap meal.",

I really like the fried chicken, there's something in it makes it special. *** When you ask for Chilli, make sure you really love the Chilli cause the aunty will dump the whole Chilli onto the noodle and not on the side. Carrot Cake is not bad. Nasi Lemak too.",

Overall good enough to come back again for the beehoon.\n\nDefinitely better than the likes of tamp hub and the market area near TP. Price abt the same as outside",
