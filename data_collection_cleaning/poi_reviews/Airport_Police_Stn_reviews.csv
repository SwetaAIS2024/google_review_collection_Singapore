Farah Nabilah,5,Do not enter the Airport Police Division to explore or you'll be chased by a policeman! There’s a Pedestrian Overhead Bridge that links the bus stop to Changi Airport Terminal 4. The Pedestrian Overhead Bridge is 196 metres long and spans across the 10 lanes of Airport Boulevard! Beautiful view.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103146998528762081591/reviews

Sean Miller,5,"If you have a flight at Terminal 4 and would like to take public transit to reach the airport, this is the best station to get off the bus to reach the terminal. I love Terminal 4, but getting there from public transit is quite a pain - although the path to the terminal from the bus station is relatively well marked, it is still pretty easy to get lost, so budget some extra time for following the path to the terminal.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112623089326463590809/reviews
