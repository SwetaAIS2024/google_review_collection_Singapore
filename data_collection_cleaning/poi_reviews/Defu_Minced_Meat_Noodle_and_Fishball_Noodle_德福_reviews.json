I was totally mesmerised by the lady boss because of her friendliness!\n\nPrice: She had kept her food prices low for many years, and increased to $3.50 for the fishball noodle probably not long ago. It still seems like a fair price for a super budget person like me.\n\nTaste: I love her mee kia and had tried mee pok (my girlfriend's order) that satisfied my stomach well.\n\nGenerosity: She went for holidays not long ago and bought snacks for her customers! Although we were new to her stall, she gave us some as well! Most importantly, she gave a very generous portion of food and extra ingredients.\n\nFood hygiene: A week ago, a not-very-pleasant man behind the queue somehow moved our bowl of noodle while she was still preparing another bowl, she quickly stopped the man, and they had a dispute. She was super concern with the hygiene level of her food, at the expense of offending an unsound man. I think she's also very righteous.\n\nDue to her working alone, I hope people can be more patient with her. She's really fast in preparing the food and she can take multiple orders at the same time - a rare food seller I have met.",

The lady owner is friendly and will give you more spinach if you ask nicely. Noodle is quite okay as well. Overall good! And cheap!\n\nWould recommend to try if you stay around the neighborhood!",

I‚Äôve been a regular customer, and every time she‚Äôs been kind and welcoming to both me and my child since day one. She even offered my little one some snacks and free fishball. It‚Äôs possible she‚Äôs had an off day or been overwhelmed managing the stall on her own, but in my experience, she‚Äôs always been pleasant. Let‚Äôs all remember to live and let live!",
