Liliana Andrade,5,"The best. Definitely. We arrived two years ago to Singapore and Iâ€™m grateful we were so lucky to find this place. They are very kind (to humans and dogs), they know what theyâ€™re doing and they do it great. I wouldnâ€™t trust my dogs to anyone else.

Josh Chambers,5,Superb! Most pet owners worry about sending their dog to the groomers because they are worried that they won't be happy there. My puppy just came bounding out of Machopawz confident and glowing after a lovely grooming session. They really love the animals and take such good care of them. Incredibly professional and highly recommended.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118104783089034932110/reviews
