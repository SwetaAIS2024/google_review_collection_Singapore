      "text": "It look decent like a Japanese small eatery. However when the food came it was quite disappointing after eating some. As I eat more the food - there were some black dots inside the soup. It was certain that it was burned somehow that the pot that they used to heat the soup and noodle up were charred. The meat was okie, however the soup based were pretty not up to standard. the staff claimed that it was due to the grill ingredients. Kindly check your food properly before serving.",

Broth is seasoned well\n\nHave been coming here before or after blood donation and will continue to do so as it‚Äôs just at the basement.",
