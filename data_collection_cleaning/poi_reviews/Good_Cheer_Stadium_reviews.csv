Adam Chong,5,"Customer service here is top notch. I dropped one of my earpieces at the bar, luckily managed to reach out to Esther via email even though it was after midnight. She was very fast in reaching out to the on-site staff who had already found my earpiece. Very happy customer, keep up the great service üëç",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113365685933101767623/reviews
Dennis Chua,5,"Great place to have a couple of drinks, listening to music and play pool. On a gentle note, I think it's time for the pool table cloth to be changed. I can notice a few little holes on the pool cloth and wearing off at the cushions. Please kindly request your boss for a table cloth change if possible Esther (manager). üôèüôèüôè. Will continue to support this great establishment.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110311363680451542230/reviews
T greensake,4,"Had Guinness Stout, Sapporo Premium Beer, Margherita Pizza & Sichuan Chicken this evening (11/10/23), was good. Music was loud due to karaoke singing by patrons.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
Toemie Tan,1,"Staff notified us that there is no food about 11 when we walked in. That's fair. But more than an hour before closing, about 1230, everyone in the room can smell the aroma of air-fried food. After asking the staff, it's their ""staff snack"" before closing apparently?? If its so easy to just air fry some snacks, why couldn't you do it for paying customers?",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109281153021945724357/reviews
Mark Tho,4,"Nice place to hang out with darts, pool (free) and typical pub dice game. Also open karaoke - so expect some less desirable singing or songs! üòä

Drinks at happy hour is cheap! Tower for $46! Bar food so so but for the entertainment this place offers, it‚Äôs acceptable.

Great hangout for big groups!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108336947993231942478/reviews
