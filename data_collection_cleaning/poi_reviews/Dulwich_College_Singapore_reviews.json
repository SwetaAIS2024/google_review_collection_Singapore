      "text": "Could the school cease from heavy traffic and work opposite my home till 9ish pm?(Blk 445B). I had enough of workers and staff peering into my home. I am sure there is cut off school operation hours especially if it near residential area. I simply don't understand the school's need to function specifically areas facing homes. Surely, for a large school meetings, could be directed to other parts of school. Moreover, your school closes around 3ish, easily you could direct your cleaners to commence cleaning or maintenance thereafter, instead of starting work from 6ish onwards from my observations. It has been 7 years and I do not see any attempt to improve or be considerate towards being good neighbours.  Apart from heavy usage of residential facilities by your school parents and student  throughout the day, I have reached my height of tolerance and quite frankly I am done being accommodative.  All other local schools in the neighbourhood are not this destructive. Please work on improving your understanding to local cultures.",

They were eating chips and sharing it around, making a lot of noise, and sitting in an unsightly manner. It seemed like they had no sense of proper social behaviour. Not the first time i’ve encountered through these years, the school simply doesn’t bother to take action.",

Also, you may think it is good that they have pizza, but i ripped off the cheese and the top bit of the bread, and there was mould on the pizza! with that, the price fore two tiny slices of pizza that you have to wait for ten minutes to get costs $7!\nEven the normal food quality is meh.\nThe school is pretty good though.\nThe bus aunties are really mean by the way.",
