Anamika Dudeja,4,Went there at 9pm for coffee after dinner. Very good offer and pricing. The service is very fast and we loved our latte and caramel macchiato.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101555083354592947514/reviews
Rochelle (OchieBon),5,"Love that Luckin Coffee has dining area here so I can enjoy my coffee while editing videos. The staff was nice and smiling always. Must try the new Apple Fizzy Americano super the best!! Each sip delivers a burst of crisp apple flavour, blended with sparkling soda and Americano coffee notes. Take note it's packed with the goodness of 1.4 applesüçé (made with 3 varieties of apple) in every cup!

Follow Ochiebon (IG/Fb/YT/TT) for more detailed review. Thanks Luckin Coffee :)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107572074312956587143/reviews

Kristian Schmidt,4,"An interesting corner for meetups outside the weekend, ie when not too crowded. You order on the APP and pickup at counter. But I think my friend managed to get a coffee without the APP. Note, the offers can be confusing.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111793996912882793733/reviews
