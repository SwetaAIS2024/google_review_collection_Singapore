"Yong Hui, Ronny Tan",4,"+ Great taste. Portion not that big though.

+ The stall sells quite a variety of dishes including donburi, udon, Japanese curry, Ishiyaki (fried rice).

- Prices are reasonable.

+ Located in quiet hidden corner of the estate. Less hot and expensive compared to the other nearby coffeeshop at 209B Clementi Ave 6.

+ Ample sheltered MSCP parking next door.

- Few other stall options in this coffeeshop if your companions want to try something else.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103854866816776797/reviews

Andrew Leong,5,"Recommended this place by my sis!

The pork curry Katsu Don is really amazing! The pork cutlet is so soft and juicy! The curry was so flavourful! A match made in heaven!! Restaurant grade at hawker price! Super worth while!

Lots of parking here and easy to find a seat!

Definitely will come back again!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113862230879561533617/reviews
Faith Liu,5,"As a fussy eater, I have always been skeptical about finding ""authentic"" jap food in a kopitiam setting. However, I must say that this shop is really underrated!! My go to order is always the same: Beef Curry Udon for $7.90 that comes with a generous serving! Sooo good!! Please dont ever close down, your food is really ðŸ’¯",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112010696806427701804/reviews
