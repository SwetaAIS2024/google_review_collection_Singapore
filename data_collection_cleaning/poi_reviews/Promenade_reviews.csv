Dresden PosÄ™t,5,"Honestly, this MRT station is unexpectedly large. It is largely intertwined in many places, so it may take some time to travel from the MRT to your destination. It is quite easy to navigate though, just look at the signs that are scattered everywhere.

The design is noticeable too, with the water droplets standing out the most. Overall, this MRT station is pretty decent, and surprisingly enormous, despite being an underground MRT station.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100555790826902422091/reviews

Sudipto Guha,5,"A huge station located close to the sunsetek City mall.

Samuel Edyson,5,"Hmm, smell of the new mrt (Bayfront). Clean and minimalistic. Ain't short of decorative designs either. MRT serves Circle Line & Downtown Line.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108333055052140661429/reviews
