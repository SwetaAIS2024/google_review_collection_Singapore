      "text": "Toast box standard is pretty much constant.\nPrices are kind of a tad higher than the other coffee places.\n\nThis toast box has a lot of art in the premises. Even the ceiling has a lot of cherubs painting on it.\n\nService was prompt and food was good. I think the festive reindeer cake was nice, although it had quite abit of cream on it. But the kids love it.\n\nThe drink size is big which is comparable to the price point of the drink. The curry was good, but is 3 pieces of chicken wing really enough. I do hope that the number of chicken wings in the curry do not get reduced in view of all the food prices hike.",
