Singapore Fooder,5,"Simply peranakan cuisine offers an exceptional dining experience with truly authentic food. From the moment we arrive, the warm place made us feel like home. The interior beautifully reflects the rich heritage of peranakan culture, creating a cozy atmosphere.

The food is a true highlight, with dishes like ayam buah keluak, standing out for their deep flavors and perfect balance of spices. The beef rendang was incredibly tender. To top of it all, the desserts were the perfect sweet ending. We had an amazing time savoring the delicious food while soaking in the peranakan ambiance. The service making the experience even more memorable.

assam fish head curry: very tender and delicate. The taste of the curry soup just topnotch! Not too strong, which is i like it very much

sambal Kang Kong: very smoky taste and garlicky, once you eat, you will never stop eating that kangkung.

Beef rendang : the meat very tender, and you can feel the coconut and the rich of ingredient just there. Recommended",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114594257949309436317/reviews
unsharable,5,"Went to Simply Peranakan and my parents really liked the food. The dishes were piping hot and hearty, and the tender babi poteng is great for older family members. (My personal favourite was the mian xian.)

And the service was amazing!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104370961408002722246/reviews
