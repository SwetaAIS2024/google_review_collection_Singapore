Rin Reduwan,5,"I finally got around to trying these fresh spices, bought Laksa rempah and Curry seafood rempah. The uncle is so cute, friendly and helpful! He explained to me how to use the rempah, what to cook with and I really appreciated his tips. Priced reasonably at $3.50 for the smallest size, which I feel can be used up two times. Iâ€™ve made a big pot of laksa with ease without the hassle of making the rempah. Thank you Uncle!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114997326636053024950/reviews
