      "text": "+ Good taste.\n\n+ The stall sells both breakfast food (mee rebus), and lunch/ dinner food (nasi padang).\n\n+ Located in quiet hidden corner of the estate. Less hot and expensive compared to the other nearby coffeeshop at 209B Clementi Ave 6.\n\n+ Ample sheltered MSCP parking next door.\n\n- Prices not low with mee rebus starting at $4 but that's unfortunately standard for coffeeshops in new HDB estates nowadays.\n\n- Few other stall options in this coffeeshop if your companions want to try something else.",

      "text": "It's a nasi padang eatery but hot d@mn - they have 4 kinds of chili !  (check out my photos)\nFrom nasi lemak sambal type to super hot limey sambal belachan.\n\nThe ayam penyet is nice enough (the fried batter is just not as crispy as i would expect), but when u add in the lemak padi gravy, begedil and all 4 types of sambal, the dish is VERY satisfying.\n\nChili-heads, give this place a try if you are in the neighbourhood.  While i mourn the passing of Ayam Taliwang, this place is an acceptable substitute for a chili fix :)\n\nUpdate 2024 : they seem to have moved from owning an entire unit at the junction of west coast & clementi road to a hawker stall in clementi ave 6.  Ah well, good while it was nearby :)",

Each and every dish also has good depth of flavour, nothing is remotely one-dimensional in taste. The chicken breast was even still moist inside, really surprised me, it was perfect.\n\nConfirm will be coming back again, and maybe again after that also!",
