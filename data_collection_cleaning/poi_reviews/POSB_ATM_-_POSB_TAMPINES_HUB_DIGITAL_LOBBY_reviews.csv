DR DAVY GOH,5,"Located on B1 of Tampines Hub.
POSB atms with video teller machine.
Not crowded location (maybe because there was another atm machine near NTUC, and this location was at a corner, near the parking entrance)

With the video teller machine, almost all POSB transactions and services could be done here.
Thankfully, there was minimal crowd.
This location would be the to-go-to location compared to other locations with the video teller machine.

Also there is a AXS machine location inside.
Convenient to pay your bills.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100178836333366849641/reviews
