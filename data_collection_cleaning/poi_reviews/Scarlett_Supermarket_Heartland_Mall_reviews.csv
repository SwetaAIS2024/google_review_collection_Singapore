Renna Sim,1,"Have been regular customer, but today staff tell me that 3 meat is unable to mix with 2 veg in one box, where we have been able to all along. Include rice $9 but today we have to pay for $16.we want to eat fresh even 2 person eat cant finish the food and so wasted balance alot.

Right now because have to purchase extra, resulted in extra food wastage.

Tan Sc,5,"I recently bought “Bingtanghulu” from Andy, and the experience was fantastic! The selection was great, and Andy was incredibly helpful in guiding me to choose the best options. The candy was fresh, delicious, and beautifully packaged. Andy’s friendly and attentive service made the whole process enjoyable.
