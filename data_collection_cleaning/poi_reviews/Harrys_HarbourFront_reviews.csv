Florence Koh,5,"Awesome experience.A quiet dinner  on May Day (5/1).. had their new dish"" kuchap manis ribs .. tender and not too salty. "" Pep Pizza had visible slices of pepperoni.. not stingy! And it went well with their house pour Cab Sav ( came with a surprise tapas). Most importantly, I really appreciate their time to explain the new dishes and how to order/ be a member. I will come back again for sure. Great service from Kim.. ( Harbor Front branch).",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107000706639980364657/reviews
DERBIE WONG,4,"I come back again after few years ago, the ribeye is definitely surprising me this time!! i order rare, usually a lot of restaurant also can't meet the expectation for me, always make it medium rare or almost well done. but this time i think i definitely will come back again. the only thing is the environment is a bit warm and the location not really convinient.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111370369745460000724/reviews
YUEN MING CHEW,3,"Went on a Saturday afternoon in Dec 2024.

Staff were great. But food was not. Only the satay was nice. Beef sliders were small and dry. We left the Quesquedillas unfinished. Grilled salmon was fishy. Other branches have better grilled salmon.

It was kind of empty.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111674491783269274348/reviews
