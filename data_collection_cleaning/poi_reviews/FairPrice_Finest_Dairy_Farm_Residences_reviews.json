      "text": "The quality of the Farm Fresh milk is anything but fresh, and is getting from bad to worse, and my experience is that the milk in 2 out of 10 bottles of Farm Fresh milk would be bad (few times became like bad yogurt) even opened 1 or 2 weeks from the expiry dates and kept at the top shelf of my new fridge.\n\nEven for the other cartons which are not overly bad, they would not taste as good as before. Taste funny frequently like about to go bad.\n\nI have switched completely to the more expensive but much more consistently good Magnolia milk which has been improved and is perfect for the espresso coffee I make at home. If you feel the thickness of the carton boxes of Magnolia milk versus that of Farm Fresh, you would understand why the Farm Fresh milk is often bad or borderline",
