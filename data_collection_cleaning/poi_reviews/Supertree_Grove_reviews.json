Some visitors will lay down and take the video upwards. Very good planning and design. After that most of the spectators went to Satay by the bay to enjoy delicious dinner. Absolutely radiant and full of spectrums with the presentation. Highly recommend.",

      "text": "This place is definitely a must-see! The best part? It’s free to explore, except for the walkway (but trust me, it’s worth it). Around 7:45 PM and 8:45 PM, they feature synchronized light displays set to music, transforming the entire area into a magical atmosphere. It's truly picturesque—like something straight out of a dream. One of the things I really loved was how spacious it was. There’s plenty of room to just chill, take a deep breath, and appreciate the beauty around you.",

      "text": "Gardens by the Bay in Singapore is an amazing and beautiful park that shows how you can combine a city with gardens. There are amazing botanical gardens, well-kept plants and flowers, and neat paths that are fun to walk on. The highlight of the place is the suspension bridge, which gives an amazing view and is highly recommended to climb. Another place that is highly recommended to climb is the tall tree from where there is an amazing 360-degree view of southern Singapore. The gardens are maintained to a high standard and the landscaping there is impressive. After sunset, there is an amazing light show there, and it is highly recommended.",
