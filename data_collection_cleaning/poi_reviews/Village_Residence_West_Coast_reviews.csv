Jina Kim,5,"Highly recommended.

The facilities are very comfortable, and the staff are friendly and welcoming. There are large shopping malls, supermarkets, and a park nearby, making it very convenient. The bus stop is also close, providing easy access to public transportation.

John Stanfliet,5,The rooms are well kept and clean. The view is great. The location is excellent. It is on top of a mall and there is a market across the road with a variety of food stalls and other stalls that sell everyday necessities at very good prices.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102047313392190952952/reviews
Neil Molloy,5,"This place was awesome to stay, so much better than any hotel. The staff were fantastic, and John at the front desk was very attentive to any needs. Highly recommend families staying here. The amenities, BBQ, pool, were first class. Right on top of a great shopping centre and easy access across the road to more market stores. Self contained, it was like staying in a 3 bedroom apartment with kitchen, laundry, etc. Fantastic.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110669412958230018801/reviews
