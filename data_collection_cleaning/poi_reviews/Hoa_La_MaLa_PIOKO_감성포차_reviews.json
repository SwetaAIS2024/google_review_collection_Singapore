The service was great - the lady welcomed us in and did an introduction of the menu. We ordered three types - malatang level 0 (non-spicy) for our kid, level 2, and malaban level level 2. All ingredients were well prepared to our satisfaction.",

Ingredients were fresh, service was good, and the overall taste was great. I was particularly surprised by the fried chicken - the chicken was boneless yet tasted & looked like bone-in chicken (which in my book is vastly superior to boneless chicken). Will be going back when I am in the mood for Mala Tang.",
