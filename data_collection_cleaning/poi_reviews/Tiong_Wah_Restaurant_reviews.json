(Stall : Red Apple Vegetarian)\n\nIts pork is crispy & yet soft paired with a balanced sweet sour sauce and freshly cut ü•í+üçç+ü´ë+ü•¨. It's been a while since I've come across such a Vegetarian stall. Highly recommended!\n\nPrice wise a bit high side but still decent & is quite filling though.\n\nRemember to order the Kopi-C siu dai, it's coffee really good. The right balance and intoxicating ‚òï aroma ü§§\n\n**\n1. Came back again for Hor Fun this time. Not so bad but still got room for improvement ( Not piping hot as the sauce just drenched over it w/o cooking together with the Hor Fun, hence the texture not soft  & smooth enough to complement. )",

Additionally, their Thai cuisine is a must-try, especially the flavorful Tom Yam soup and a variety of other delectable dishes. The roast duck is another highlight, though it's worth noting they close at 2 pm. I've also heard rave reviews about their vegetarian options, and it's clear they have a dedicated fan base, though I have yet to sample them myself.",
