Xling Tang,5,"We tried their new Seoul Butter Pork Belly menu and had the Pocha Duo Set, perfect for 2 pax at $99 (U.P. $109). The set includes:

- Butter Aged Duroc Pork Belly
- Boneless Prime Ribs
- Cold Noodle (Spicy or Soup)
- Kimchi Fried Rice
- Small Soup – Choice of: Kimchi Pork, Spicy Seafood Tofu, or Seafood Beanpaste
Everything was so good!

We also tried their Half & Half Pancake and absolutely loved it! It’s a great way to enjoy two different flavors in one without having to order two separate pancakes.

To pair with our meal, we had the Yuzu Makgeolli, a refreshing and slightly tangy Korean rice wine with a citrusy twist.

Oh, and a bonus, free French fries for kids!and their banchan so delicious!

With the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff, we’ll definitely be coming back for more!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103954248798037993511/reviews
Joey,4,"Came for a simple meal.
Ordered the saba fish ($20) and soy sauce ($17-18? Can’t remember) boneless fried chicken.

Overall the food is decent, saba fish was fresh albeit a bit pricey.

Portion for the fried chicken was slightly too little given the price as well, but the flavors were there.

Side dishes were good, loved the marinated cucumber the most.

Most memorable part was definitely the service there. Staff were friendly and efficient.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111353835220742920249/reviews
parttimefoodblogger,5,"We tried the 4-person set, which came with high-quality beef short ribs, thinly sliced brisket, pork belly, and marinated pork jowl.

The short ribs were thick, tender, and juicy, while the thinly sliced brisket had a smoky charred flavor. The pork jowl had a sweet marinade and was perfectly balanced. The set also included seafood tofu soup, Korean fried chicken, and crispy pancakes—everything was flavorful, with the soup standing out for its rich, seafood-infused broth.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117258375016455184903/reviews
Skye Cai,4,"Tried the lunch set, it’s not bad.
Beef hot stone with additional $.
The beef was pre-cooked, when it was served, can see the top of the beef is dry. Seemed to be left outside for long.
The pancake as side dish is great. Crispy at the outer and inner is soft.
Kimchi  soup is normal, with heavy pork taste.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Lee Lee,5,"My first time here and surprised to see that the place is also packed on a Sun in CBD area!

We ordered the festive set that is good for 5 to 6 pax. The food portions are very generous! Meats were fresh and service very prompt

Highly recommended!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113247210957945075470/reviews
