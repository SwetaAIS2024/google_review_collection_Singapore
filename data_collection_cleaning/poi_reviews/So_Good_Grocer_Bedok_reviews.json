Good for them üëçüèª\n\nBut there's this taller, plump young guy who is very unpleasant ‚Äî he has a \"don't bother me\" attitude during collection, as if we are the ones at fault to collect our parcels from him. Please go find your dream job, or work with machines if you can't offer decent customer service! It's a shame to have you tending the store.",
