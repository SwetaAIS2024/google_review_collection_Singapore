Not even there at the shop for a minute, she speaks to me in a rude manner to get me done soon, never had this kind of experience in Singapore! Also, selling expired items but no response even when mentioned to the cashier, just asking me to not buy it. SFA must not condone this place.",

Most of the produce kept is vegetarian and a few exceptions like eggs or milk products are the only non vegetarian options available. Initially they did try to sell frozen chicken and frozen chicken snacks but no avail to those products caused them to stop keeping it. You may request the shop owner though to seek chicken snacks for you. All in all A good place.",

      "text": "The price is way high particularly for the vegetables. The place is also cramped. Sorry to say it is not a good experience.\n\nReceived a response for my earlier review. As I could not find an option to reply, I am adding to the earlier post:\n\nEveryone understands about Covid situation. But the question is how other Indian stores in the surrounding are able to maintain the low price. Here are a few examples\n\nOther Indian stores\tMurugan\nGreens/ Spinach\t$9\t        $15\nOnion bag\t$3.50\t      $4.50+\nVegetables\t$4.80-$6\t$9-$12\n\nThe prices are almost doubled. This is highly unethical and mere exploitation of the customers which should be avoided. Would appreciate if the authorities think ethically and take necessary steps to keep prices inline with other stores. Thanks.",
