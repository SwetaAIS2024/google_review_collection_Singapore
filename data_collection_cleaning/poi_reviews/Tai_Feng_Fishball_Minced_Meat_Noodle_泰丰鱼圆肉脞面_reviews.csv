Wei xiong Wang,5,"Tai Feng Fishball Minced Meat Noodle Ê≥∞‰∏∞È±ºÂúÜËÇâËÑûÈù¢
üìç 4 Defu Lane 10, Singapore 539185

üçú Food wise: The first mouth of the noodles, woah, immediately felt that one may have found a hidden gem. The taste of this was definitely above average, one wasn't expecting this.

The flavour of the noodles was good, looked dry on the surface only but with a closer look, the noodles were glazed with some wonderful sauce. It tasted exactly like how would one expect from a good Bak Chor Mee, the well balanced 3 sauces, ketchup, chili, and vinegar, as well as the fragrance of mushrooms and minced meat! So good! They were generous with the amount of noodles as well!

The meatball was quite good too, soft, firm, and tasty! The pork slices were tender and succulent!

Always appreciated condiments and garnishes, so this stall sells lor mee too, so one added garlic for additional flavour, no regrets, tasted good too, it gave more depth as well as more spice! Fried shallots were added too!

‚ú® Ambience wise: Some huge eating house, was told that this eating house has a few other gems like fish soup and chicken rice. Shall try one day.

ü§µüèª Service wise: Great!

üíµ Price wise: $4!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100695078669204769827/reviews
