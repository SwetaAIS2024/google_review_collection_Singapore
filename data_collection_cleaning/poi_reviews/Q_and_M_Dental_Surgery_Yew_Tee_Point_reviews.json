I‚Äôve had my first wisdom tooth extraction some time last year, and it was a pleasant experience, at least as far as I‚Äôve remembered.\n\nSo this year, I decided to get my second wisdom tooth extraction again (for my upper right and lower left teeth), and requested for Dr Jennifer. I had no idea to what extent I could endure the pain, but I can honestly say that the surgery was almost painless and a quick one too!\n\nDr Jennifer and team were professional and absolutely gentle and reassuring throughout the surgery.\n\nThank you guys! ü¶∑ü™•",
