      "text": "I Love Thai Mart #01-40\nLive since 2022 July.\nSo happy to stumble on this store conveniently located at CityGate level 1.\nThere is a bus stop just outside the mall on Beach Road opposite St Johnâ€™s HQ.\nFor the Thais and customers of Thai products, this merchant is here to meet their needs and request for healthier items.\n\nFinally could find the Lays Mieng Kam Krob Ros chips. Comes in 6s in a pack. No discount for buying 6. Would love if this item is less salty.\n\nThis item has a short BBF-date and runs out fast. Appetising blend of ingredients : lime, ginger, chilli, dried shrimp and coconut with an unexpected treat for your palate. With the pack of dark green color represents the original form of Miang Kam flavour (a Siamese traditional food) by Lay's.\nThis Lays Mieng Kam Krob Ros flavour is only unique in Thailand and even difficult to find in Bangkok. Even the HQ in US does not know this product.\nPrice keeps going up.\n\nThe owner of I Love Thai Mart is relatively friendly and helpful. He will clear path and help find if there is more stock in his storeroom.\nLong operating hours and tiring for lone owner, on average 11am-8.30pm to catch the dinner crowd.\nHavenâ€™t have time to explore the store.\nUsually rush to get the preferred and run.",

When I couldnâ€™t find the expire date on the packaging, I asked the cashier and he claimed that the product just came yesterday. But when I reached home and managed to see the expiry date is in two months time. How come the product that just came yesterday only left two months expiry date?? He must have lied to me ðŸ˜¡",
