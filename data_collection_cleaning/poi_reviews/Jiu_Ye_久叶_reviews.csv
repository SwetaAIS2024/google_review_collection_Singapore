Clement Loh,5,"The chee cheong fun is very nice. Smooth and savory, not too salty. Porridge is also very health, not salty yet able taste the porridge. When u put both chee cheong fun and porridge together, is match made in heaven. Tanglin halt hawker was a very popular place back in the 80's. Worth the try.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102419857399310335575/reviews
Ivan Loh,4,"Chee Cheong Fun is made by the uncle on the spot after you order, so it's definitely fresh. Their menu has Chee Cheong Fun and porridge combos, which look really good and are very affordable. We ordered 2 types of Chee Cheong Fun to try and enjoyed them both. I would recommend the Fresh Prawn Chee Cheong Fun.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114542374982525257775/reviews
Chris Tan,4,"CCF is pretty good - it’s made to order. Not the thinnest & translucent skin but it has that 古早味 and the sauce is not too salty. A nice balance! At only $3++, it’s very affordable and you can top up for a small bowl of congee at $1++. It’s comfort food for breakfast and rainy days",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103463791737805347871/reviews
J Seng,4,"Chee cheong fun (猪肠粉) is steamed on the spot and the skin is very thin and soft with good texture. The fillings (e.g. char siew and veggies) are plentiful. Sauce tasted good and not too salty. A set meal with char siew chee cheong fun and porridge is $4.10, value for money.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116938237846338409963/reviews
MNG,4,"Rarely seen combo of CCF with porridge.
The CCF wasn't the thinnest but it has an old school flavor. The porridge had bits of pork and some minced veg in it. For $3.80, it is reasonably priced for elders in this old estate.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
