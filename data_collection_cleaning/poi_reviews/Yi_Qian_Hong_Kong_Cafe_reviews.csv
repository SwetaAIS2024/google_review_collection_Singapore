edtayjb,5,"My wife had some simple and yet very comfortingly good food at this HK cafe. Its Pork & Century Egg Congee looked simple but was very flavourful as we digged in. And the Shrimp Rice Roll was one of the best we've had - packed solid with decent shrimps enveloped in a thin rice roll.

UPDATE
My wife and I revisited this HK cafe a week later to try its roasted meats and more of its dim sum - notably its roasted duck & pork, its har kau, glutinous rice, and BBQ pork pastry - which we also find to be very good.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107467079327459015215/reviews
Angie Ling,5,"Definitely my favourite Hong Kong cafe to visit in Singapore. Their HK style milk tea, congee, and lava buns are divine. I’d always come by for teatime or dinner whenever I’m free after work.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101064883977701943294/reviews
Ming Hui,5,"8th mar 2025: went back for lunch again and it's still as good as ever. Uploaded more pics of the wanton noodles and my fav peanut sauce chee Cheong fan.

Wasn't expecting anything when I stepped into this cafe at railmall. But the food really blew me away. The peanut butter chee Cheong fan was the best. The noodle was good too and the roast meat. I find this better than other typical HK restaurant.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108198322351045531056/reviews
C,4,"Overall food was fantastic, authentic HK style.
I was really impressed with the shrimp Cheong fun; the shrimp used unlike those transparent shrimp, I loved this better as it’s the solid blue tail shrimp - love the texture & taste to the max.
The carrot cake was also pretty good, ingredients used was superb and you can basically taste the carrot than the “flour”.
One thing though the table may be a little too compact if you order various dishes as you need to make space…",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110704375820971665962/reviews
Jason Ong,3,"Hong Kong style dim sum cafe. They filled up the space with tables with the end result that it felt quite cramped when dining there.
The food was ok, not bad but not great either. It's ok to try as they are the only dim sum shop at the Rail Mall.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews
