I’m not a vegetarian, but the food at this restaurant was truly out of the ordinary—flavorful, creative, and so satisfying that I didn’t even miss meat. Every dish was prepared with such care and attention to detail, bursting with fresh ingredients and bold flavors. The menu offers a fantastic variety, proving that vegetarian cuisine can be exciting and indulgent.

The atmosphere was warm and inviting. Whether you're a lifelong vegetarian or just looking to explore plant-based dining, this place is a must-try. I’ll definitely be coming back and bringing friends with me. Highly recommend!""",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
David Cheng,5,"Outstanding Vegetarian Dining Experience at Elemen Restaurant – Woodlands

I had the pleasure of dining at Elemen Restaurant at their Woodlands branch, and I must say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. This establishment truly lives up to its philosophy of promoting a modern, wholesome meatless dining experience.

From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable. The staff were attentive, courteous, and knowledgeable, always ready to explain the dishes and accommodate our preferences with genuine warmth. The ambiance of the restaurant was elegant yet tranquil, creating a perfect setting for a relaxed and enjoyable meal.

The menu was thoughtfully curated, showcasing a creative fusion of Asian and Western influences. Each dish was artfully presented and packed with flavor. The use of fresh, high-quality ingredients was evident in every bite. Particular highlights included the Truffle Mushroom Pizza, the Crispy Oyster Mushroom, and the refreshing Lemongrass Mocktail – all prepared with great finesse and attention to detail.

What stood out most was the restaurant’s ability to elevate vegetarian cuisine to a fine-dining level, offering both variety and sophistication without compromising on taste or nutritional value. It’s rare to find a place that caters so well to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.

Overall, Elemen at Woodlands delivers an outstanding dining experience – one that is both nourishing and indulgent. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a refreshing, health-conscious, and truly delightful meal.

A heartfelt thank you to the team at Elemen for such a memorable visit. I look forward to returning very soon.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102759859067767343407/reviews
Jacelyn,3,The service is so slow and they are understaff. After the starter we waited 40 min for the next dishes and the drinks never come till the last 2 dishes. Overall the food is average and some food not to our liking but consider not bad for the presentation as it is fusion vegetarian.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111010667983647437264/reviews
Kai Ming Hew,5,"The appetizers are with minimum additional processing in their flavours, hence heavily depending on the freshness of the vegetables and fruits. Most effort is on the plating.

The tacos are served with strawberry sauce embedded with cucumber cubes and maybe cranberry? I tried to eat without the sauce but it tasted a bit dry. Definitely a delicacy eating with the sauce

The winter chowder soup  is exceeding my expectation. It is creamy but not oily, with slight coconut scent to bring out the good aroma without overpowering the whole flavour. I really appreciate the hardworking to achieve such balance.

I would also highlight the mouth feel of the mushroom meatballs. Especially while chewing, it shows no difference from the pork meatballs you will get from a typical minced pork noodle stall

Coming to the main dish, the king oyster mushroom Wellington, my experience is a bit mixed. The plating, the sides, the sauce are quite decent, but the puff pastry seems not working well with the big mushroom. I had a hard time slicing the mushroom and the pastry. I did not try the real beef Wellington, but the pastry of this mushroom version is wet and clumpy, unlike normal crispy fresh pastries. Perhaps it is not very friendly to amateur western cuisine diner like me.

The dessert, pistachio gelato with chocolate mousse cake, is ordinarily delicious, though personally I feel the mousse cake is a bit oversweetened.

In summary, this Christmas course meal is having fairly good quality and worth trying in this festive season.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112071062111471106051/reviews
Phoebe Tan,1,"The decor of the restaurant was the only nice thing there. As a regular customer of elemen, I was appalled at the lack of service and food quality as compared to other branches in singapore. The mushroom soup was extremely thick, the pizza was undercooked with too much cheese, and the service staff was extremely undertrained, taking away our plates before finishing our food. Would not recommend this place.

They also added this coffee cake in the menu that tastes exactly like their tiramisu. Questionable menu change across all elemen stores.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103532507619469064404/reviews
