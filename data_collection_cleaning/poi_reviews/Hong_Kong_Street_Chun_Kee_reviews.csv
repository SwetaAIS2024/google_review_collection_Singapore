Alvin Choo,3,"I walked past this stall multiple times but brushed them off as just another tze char stall. However, I found out recently that they are THE ORIGINAL 香港街珍记, and that made me want to try the food, as growing up, there were multiple places naming themselves as such, and one was near my place. These were shops opened by their ex chefs after they became famous.

We ordered fried prawn rolls, prawn paste chicken, spinach with bean curd skin and san lou hor fun (total $53). We didn't have to wait long for the food.

Only the prawn paste chicken was decent. The prawn rolls were nothing extraordinary. The biggest disappointment was the san lou hor fun as there was no wok hei at at. Actually, while writing this review, I'm struggling to remember if it was even hot when served.

I had hoped to experience some old school delights, but I left with only disappointment.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
Winnie,3,"Don't know why it's so popular.  Just like any other zhi char stall in a coffee shop. The prawn in cereal was good as it was deahelled and medium size. Don't have the curry fish head, think fish not fresh.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105453921628996101695/reviews
Ivan Tan (FireFox),4,Great place for traditional Chinese family dinner. Can order satay on the side. Good value for excellent food. Only drawback is the humidity in this place. The fans are too close to the ceiling and does not do any justice. Still a great place for larger groups.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117659783939101213413/reviews

derek neo,4,"I visited Hong Kong Street Chun Kee today after a 2-year and unfortunately, history repeated itself - the signature Song fish head was sold out!

We opted for the Calypot grouper instead, and it was delicious! The flavors were bold and tantalizing, making it a truly memorable experience.  The other dishes we ordered were above average.  While I'm still eager to try the elusive Song fish head, the Calypot grouper has certainly compensated for the disaapointed.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113015523826545524096/reviews
