      "text": "Searching n trying on different skin care has been always a small problem to me til I discover Butterfly Apothecary skinny care products on TikTok live one day.\n\nI see how the founder Ms Norah explain n also sharing her products n every products she try it on her own before she start sharing n selling. So I decided to get the basic Placenta spray, royal cream and dragon blood to try.\n\nFor Placenta spray it really is a toner with a purpose cos I have combination skin n normally some days my skin will peel n dry. It does help to hydrate my skin.\n\nWhen I use Royal cream with Placenta spray it help to ease the peel pain n royal cream help me with Abit of coverage when going out .\n\nI must say the product that amaze me most is the dragon blood cos the peelin during make me uncomfortable..so for 3 nights I put thick layer before I go to bed. The peeling session of my face heal 90 percent after that.\n\nNow I'm testing on the eye cream on my panda eyes ..will update the result with all :)\n\nI wanna give a big shout out to the admin who has been replying to my message cos when I was having a bad peeling on my face, I not too sure if I can carry on using the product. She guide me patiently over the tt message without fail:)\n\nThank you Butterfly Apothecary , Norah for the great products:)",
