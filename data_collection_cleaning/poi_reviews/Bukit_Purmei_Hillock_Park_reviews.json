      "text": "Nice park with good jogging track. This park also have complete public gym, futsal court, and BBQ grill. You can reserve the fursal court and BBQ grill online or directly reserve it in the office. For the BBQ grill, they have special grill for halal food. Another thing is this place has an amphiteather. But, mostly, people are jogging here, with a lot of park seat along the way. The jogging track also have distance markers that help people to count how many KM they have jog.\n\nThis place is cozy with lush tree around. Good place for people who want to exercise, play futsal, or just chilling and relieve stress. One shortcoming is the badminton court. The badminton court does not look like a badminton court anymore, with no more line marker seen anymore. I think the badminton court is the only thing that need to be improve.\n\nIn overall, I really like this place as I like to come here to relax. I think this is one of the park that have nice and complete facilities.",
