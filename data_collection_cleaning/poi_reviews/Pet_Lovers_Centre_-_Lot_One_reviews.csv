naelee,5,"It's been 2 weeks since I brought home my new pet rabbit from PLC Lot One.

He has been adapting well in his new environment. I let him roam freely around the house and I just started introducing to him fresh vegetables too. The vet advised me to get him to go for a check up before I can get him neutered. I love him to pieces. ‚ù§Ô∏è",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101866071157781393804/reviews
Yuna,5,"Service is very good and most of the things I needed for my hamster can be found at this outlet as compared to other outlets in town area. Buying the VIP Card was worth it, and whenever birthday month arrive the discount given was alot as compared to other pet shops, some doesn't even give discount for bday month. Last but not least, staff were very very friendly, one of the staff even remembered me when I first got my hamster there. He would always ask how my hamster is doingü§≠",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108475160148054071138/reviews
