Dani Kristyawati-Teo,5,"Weee!! So honoured to be able to take a pic with Ivy as she walked to our table. She's friendly and warm! No wonder the place is also warm and welcoming. The farm reminded me of my Grandparents' farm in Indonesia, full of greenery, fresh air and so serene. May this farm continue to exist with its charms and beauty!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107696216596713594411/reviews
SD D.,5,"A few minutes drive. We enjoyed a substantial meal following our nature walk at Sungei Buloh.

The beverages were served after the meal. We were unsure of the reason for this.  The lemongrass drink was too diluted. Could have done better.

The fish n' chips were served with no lemon. We were informed that there was no lemon available. Nasi lemak set was good.  The fried chicken can be elevated with more rempah.

Overall, its a good lunch. üëç",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100082442513839156603/reviews
Farhana Mazlan,5,"If you have a chance to head here while you‚Äôre in Kranji, don‚Äôt miss the opportunity. The food is great, the staff are friendly and the ambience is truly like a much needed getaway.

However, as much as this place is lovely for food and drinks, the whole farm is just breathtakingly beautiful. There are so many events that you could join as well as so much about the farm you can learn. The trees, the plants, the fruit and flowers, the list is endless.

In Singapore, there‚Äôs a land scarcity as so many are used to build buildings. It‚Äôs so refreshing to see a farm in our very own Singapore where it‚Äôs as authentic and rural as it can be. If you‚Äôre looking to clear your mind, or just take in the wonderful nature, this is the place to go!

10/10 in charm, rustic and simple vibes and all in all the closest we can get to a kampung right here.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115595010967486099392/reviews

Bryan Be,5,"Without a car of your own this place is not too easy to reach (as also grab is often not available in the area) but if you are around the area can definitively recommend this place!

Very unique atmosphere that‚Äôs hard to find anywhere else in Singapore. Food was great too. Service was friendly",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114370535155442579923/reviews
