Nicole Chu,2,"The food was delicious and service was hospitable. However, the portions were particularly measly. We were told that we could add more noodles to the pho for an extra $1.90, which is such a money-grabber, since a bag of noodles is really not that expensive when you buy them yourself at the market. Moreover, the kampung mama meal was awfully stingy. The lemongrass chicken came with one wing and a footâ€”hardly any meatâ€”and the vegetable serving looked like an afterthought. The soup was also just a clear broth with no substance. They were generous with the rice, but given the tiny side dishes, youâ€™d end up eating plain rice on its own.

FYI, they donâ€™t take credit card. Itâ€™s either cash or payment through an app.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100713739271430140501/reviews
Chin Yong Kuah,5,"If you're craving authentic Vietnamese cuisine, this restaurant is a must-visit. The pho has a rich, flavorful broth that truly captures the essence of traditional Vietnamese cooking. The spring rolls are a standout, generously filled with large, juicy prawns. Even if youâ€™re not in the mood for Vietnamese fare, the Western dishes here are also impressively well-prepared.

The serving staff add to the excellent experience with their warm and friendly service. They were welcoming and provided great recommendations that enhanced our meal. The restaurant's inviting atmosphere makes it perfect for family dining. Highly recommended!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111963113134678531824/reviews
Bvlyn L,5,"amazing pho, wished that they gave more of the herbs and garnishes like how they do in vietnam because it enhances the already lovely taste so much more! the service is also great, the servers all kept asking if we were ok and if the food is good ðŸ¥° will definitely be back!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112640906640238817448/reviews
p tan,4,The fresh spring roll is good. Pho beef was good too but a few pieces of beef was hard to chew. Chicken skewers was more palatable when eat with the matching sauce as it is not tasty enough to eat on its own.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111393903349372648167/reviews
Harriet L. Dineen,1,The worst beef pho I have tried in a while. The soup is just pure seasoning and nothing else. The supposedly rare beef slices are tough and overcooked. The salad and platter dishes are served on green plastic sheets that are NOT food safe. The rice set has a tiny meat portion and costs 12.9++,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117980836546616381455/reviews
