      "text": "For the location, would be nice if the food menu items were more affordable. 2 burgers with sweet potato fries and a milkshake almost added up to $50 for 2 pax. Milkshake quantity is small too for the price ($7), but to be fair, it did taste premium.\n\nWould highly recommend the 2280 over the basic burger, they taste almost identical and we are not the real connoisseur who could tell the both apart. Adding an egg really elevated the experience, it is worth the calories and cholesterol.",

Self order at the 2 machines, the interface is not so user friendly if you are trying to edit options after going into cart.\nFood is decent, the burger patty is cooked to perfection but not much ingredients if you don’t add any extras.\nIced tea has option of no sugar.\nOverall an enjoyable experience, and will\ncome if in the vicinity.",

Too pricey for a work lunch though…\n\nI came back again for dinner and got the Smash Burger which was quite dry and had a charred taste.\n\nI also tried the burger with black pepper sauce and caramelized onions which was not bad.",

I would recommend the truffle fries as well if you are a fan of truffle. The price is on the steeper side for burgers and fries.",
