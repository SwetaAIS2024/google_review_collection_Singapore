Huaile Liong,5,"Dr. Sharon and her assistant, Nina, have been with my wife and me since week 5 of her pregnancy until our baby turned 3 months old, and we couldnâ€™t be more grateful for their care.

Throughout the journey, they were incredibly patient, supportive, and always available to address any concerns we had. There was a small complication during the pregnancy, but Dr. Sharonâ€™s professionalism and clear guidance reassured us every step of the way.

We genuinely looked forward to every appointmentâ€”not just because of their expertise, but also because of their warmth and kindness. Their welcoming and friendly nature made each visit a positive and comforting experience.

As a husband and a first-time father, I deeply appreciate the support and reassurance they provided, not just to my wife but to me as well. We highly recommend Dr. Sharon and her team to anyone looking for a compassionate and professional team!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111607222080285228835/reviews
choi Irene,5,"I had a consultation with Dr. Sharon, and I was truly impressed by how kind and attentive she was. She took the time to listen to all my concerns, and explained everything in a clear and reassuring way.

I visited the clinic feeling quite anxious after receiving a note about inflammation from my health screening, but thanks to Dr. Sharon, I felt completely at ease.

The nurses were also very friendly and warm, the atmosphere of the clinic is very welcoming.

I also learned that the clinic has recently been renovated so that not only general consultations and health screenings, but even operations can now be done in the same place. Definitely worth checking out!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109277789641489782959/reviews

Lynette Chang,5,"Thank you Dr. Sharon, Cynthia and Nina for creating such a safe space during our consults together throughout my pregnancy, and for being so assuring through it all. Thank you for patiently addressing this first time mumâ€™s questions, and slotting me in at the last minute when I needed to check on the little one for a peace of mind â€“ each consult didnâ€™t feel rushed but rather, filled with genuine care for the couple and our little one.

Dr. Sharonâ€™s genuine passion for OB/GYN and kids truly shines through and we are thankful to have met such a kind and caring medical team ðŸ’› weâ€™ll definitely miss our time together now that the pregnancy journey has ended but we hope this isnâ€™t goodbye!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110444346176135606059/reviews
