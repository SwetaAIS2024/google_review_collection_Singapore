      "text": "Got the fishball noodles. It is chilli noodles. Quite spicy and you can up the level of chilli. There are two fishballs. Quite good quality. Nice chew and bite. Noodle texture is also firm. The frid branched skin is quite nice. Can throw into soup to soften it. the soup is also decently good. It is a new stall. The stall helper gave me an extra meatball. The meat ball is fuzhou meat ball style with real meat in the core. The highlight is really the sauce not that common. Delicious.",
