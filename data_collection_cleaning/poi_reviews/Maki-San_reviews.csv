Cheong Wj,1,Always messing up orders. How is it possible to not add sauce into the food? Ordered salmon but didn't even add into the order? Please explain what kind of service is this. Can't even contact the store because number is invalid.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107039336877825670567/reviews
D T,5,"18 Sep 2024 (Wed) 1645H - Visited outlet. Despite the 3.0/5.0 review, the store was manned by a female and male staff. The food tasted fresh.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116832137678619588975/reviews
Bethany Li,5,"Very nice healthy sushi/salad! They let you choose your own ingredients, or you can order from a small pool of their own combination on the menu. There is a pretty large variety to choose from, many standard sushi ingredients, as well as more unconventional (but good!) ones.

11/10 would patronise frequently",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113425480703184813428/reviews
Baron Navadne,1,"I ordered a salad with GRAB. All I got is a container full of boiled pasta (a lot) and a few scattered small pieces of chicken with SKIN. The vegetables consisted of three small tomatoes and five beans. If you want to waste your money, please go ahead and order a salad from this restaurant.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103763140371509282221/reviews
nurul Syu,3,Ordered from this outlet multiple times and have never gotten any of my DIY Sushi wrong. I ordered grilled chicken strips but they put Boiled Egg instead which totally ruined my usual DIY sushi. :) please check properly before making the sushi. Thanks.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103622927479016976136/reviews
