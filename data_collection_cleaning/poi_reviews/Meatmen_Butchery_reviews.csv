Ben Chan,5,"Hilarious staff! The steak came out in uneven thickness. When I explained politely that I cannot accept it,  Chinese lady staff at the till squeezed the meat back into the desired thickness and tada! I donâ€™t know to laugh or cry!

Perhaps it is better to visit other outlets

Edit: The owner reached out offering a refund which I have politely declined because I am so happy to support this business.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115566094515723071277/reviews

Marlinda Nakkeeran,3,Thought the meat is all halal because of the TikTok but then accidentally bought a cut of pork. My eyesight is a bit bad so I didnâ€™t catch the name. The cashier saw me in a hijab but never stop me or say anything. I buy 2 cut and ate one already then found out the other one is pork. There was also no receipt given so I check one of the meat we ate was pork. It is a little upsetting. Maybe separate the halal meat or put picture to show that is halal.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103110745589794850323/reviews
Garett Lee,5,"My fav butcher for a decent selection of meats without being too exotic, for both everyday cuts and some prime options too! They also make their own seasoning which has been a great match for our BBQs we have been doing. It's pretty much our go-to place such that I don't really bother with Cold Storage anymore. Affordability and quality in one place! Oh, and did I say service is good too? ðŸ˜Š",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102429779161382378043/reviews
Leebong the dog,4,"This place is a meat lovers heaven, has everything you need from dry aged produce, tuna, brisket, even shabu shabu. The male staff who appeared to be staff/manager is very helpful recommending things to us. However, the female cashier would be better off giving us a less standoffish attitude throughout the shopping experience.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104879365869879756146/reviews
