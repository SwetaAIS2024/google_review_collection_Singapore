Nur Iman Rostam,4,"Situated on Lorong Sarhad in the heart of Pasir Panjang, Masjid Ahmad stands proud as a humble kampong mosque in its 1934 beginnings. Today, it serves the communities living and working in PSA Singapore Pasir Panjang.

The unique thing about this mosque is the colour contrasts that it possesses. The exterior is wooden-coloured with a yellow and whitewash while the praying hall is carpeted in dark red, giving that vibe of a small but effective operational machine.

Bus 200 is the only bus service that runs through the main artery road, South Buona Vista Road, perpendicular to Lorong Sarhad. Alight at Bus Stop 15079 (After Lorong Sarhad).",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110287485091231667131/reviews
Amar Koul,5,"Alhamdullilah. What a lovely mosque at the corner of South Buona Vista Road. It is conducive & cosy to pray in - plenty of space with three levels of praying area. The volunteers have also done a great job facilitating the safety measurements in view of our current situation.

Parking is widely available along Lor Sarhad & Lor Sari.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100276120372481396557/reviews
