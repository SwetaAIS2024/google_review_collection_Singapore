      "text": "First time trying out Singyan, other than the vacuum packs, i bought 3 other cooked flavours, rose, golden osmanthus and wild ginseng. Ivy (from singyan) contacted me to inform me about the delivery, and also when there was slight delay in the delivery due to rain. She is also very nice to advise me which flavour is better/nicer to eat warm and which for chill as i cant possibly consume all flavours in one day. Very impressed with their service especially when i buy through a groupbuy.\n\nAlso can see from the photos, each of their birdnest serving is very generous. Each flavours are also very nice and unique. Would definitely recommend others to give it a try!",

The texture of the bird's nest is wonderfully smooth, and the red dates add a delightful savory flavor. My son loves it too! It's the perfect gift for moms who are pregnant or have recently given birth!",
