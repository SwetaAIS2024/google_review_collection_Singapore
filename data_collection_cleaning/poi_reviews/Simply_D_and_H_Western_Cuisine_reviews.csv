Dian R,5,"Located under my block [31 Holland Close], it is owned by Moeslem.

In my opinion, ayam taliwang is spicy enough. Mushroom spaghetti is also tasty. In addition to the price, raw ingredients are now also very expensive. So, the price was considered normal.

Hopefully this stall will remain at 31 Holland Close for a longer period of time. As, it is so hard to find halal or moeslem food here.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116459679176073734172/reviews
Muhammad Ghairil,1,"Im shocked that a Halal store but there is no Muslim worker. I ordered Sphagetti Ham & Mushroom cream sauce and the price is $7.00. Okay if i pay a price of $7.00, i dont expect it to be super perfect. What i received is Sphagetti, Ham & Mushroom with Mushroom soup as gravy. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109152664495180886758/reviews
theguy_withstuff,4,"A western food stall with nice staff and good food. I had their Chicken Chop with Speghetti and the food was good and didn‚Äôt suck. Staff was nice but not noticable, and the price was a bit much for me for a hawker stall. Overall a good western food abit slightly pricy.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112628164904019834073/reviews
Yong Sheng Ng (YS),4,"I highly recommend the spring chicken - it's delicious! Just a heads up: if you pay with your CDC voucher, they'll treat it as a cash payment and won't accept any remaining balance via QR code (e.g. PayLah). Plan accordingly!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114603812666671986990/reviews
