      "text": "Wrong choice ordering risotto while the entire restaurant customers are having their pasta.\n\nHad a few bites and the rice was hard.  The rice is definitely undercooked as I took a few grains out to press it and can still see raw rice.  Not Al dente standard . Service staff said it is normal as for their restaurant standard.\n\nNice enough, she requested to change a new plate for me. To my horror, the replacement is worst, while the texture of the rice is softer but the taste lacks flavours.  It was served with a pool of oil or sticky liquid (there is no raw egg served as compared to the initial plate). I have no appetite to finish it.\n\nDuring payment, I told the service staff to have it checked if it is normal again? She doesn't bother to check the issue and say it is normal. Just try another dish next time.\n\nSeriously? I'm amazed !\nThe owner or manager of this restaurant, please tell me this is your restaurant standard and I hope to promote such an unique dish for you. ü§Æ",

Would like to mention that Sarah was super attentive and made the effort to shift diners around so we could get a sit for me and my colleagues, and her energy level was top notch, running the service and handling the payments.",

Last but not least, super thankful for the chef who made such a delicious gnocchi dish without missing the special request that i asked for. Thanks for the great service and food!  Definitely recommending it to anyone who is into gnocchi to pop by ü•∞",

As this is a small outlet with max capacity of 20+, it can be expected that tables and chairs are very closely seated.\nFood is an absolute delight with choice of classic pasta, pizza & risotto with some unique fusion flavour of curry chicken pizza\nPrice is definitely wallet friendly for an establishment in CBD\nLove the cosy little place.  Feels so welcoming like visiting a regular restaurant",
