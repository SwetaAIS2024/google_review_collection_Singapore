Chunwen Huang,5,"10/10 for the food! Ordered Mango Tango with Poached egg (additional $1.50), really flavourful and umaminess was really good!

Update 17.1.24:
Ordered the Moo Ragu with additional egg, the sauce was really flavourful and I love how the penne was cooked al dente because it isn’t soggy by the time I reach home to consume it. The cherry tomatoes had a wokhei and the sauce was thick, flavourful and reminded me a little of aglio olio dressing. 10/10 would recommend",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636541114526759357/reviews
Victor HTL,4,"I mean it was not bad, ordered a custom made, the big prawns were even torched after which was quite cool, but their pappardelle was slightly under, and I mean under Al dente, and now I know what combos will be good:
1) Creamed Salmon and Onsen Egg and Tobiko
2) Aglio Oglio with Scallops and Prawns

I will definitely be back to try again with the Spaghetti options",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105722555913037451991/reviews
Chris Koh,4,"For the price the pasta probably can even beat some of the restaurants in town. Texture of the pasta was al dente. I had pesto besto and the flavours were just right. Combined with the salmon and sous vide egg, it was a balanced meal.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115255391857475499083/reviews
Rach,4,"Googled (as usual) for nice food at Bugis junction and decided to try this as I love pasta. The beetroot pasta was thick and chewy, though like other reviewers mentioned it was a bit too tough to eat so I ended up steaming it to soften. Aglio olio base was quite tasty. They could be more generous w the salmon pieces though - felt that it wasn’t a lot compared to the photos in other reviews. All in all, not bad and I’ll try it w the other main/protein ingredients (e.g. chicken breast/prawn) the next time. Hopefully those are better portioned and more filling!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100368288078910287205/reviews
Jess Y,3,"Spaghetti Meet Balls, or chicken meatball pasta, was packed with sauce separately which was great. Pasta was fresh and three meatballs were big and juicy. I quite enjoyed it — but I got really thirsty after (needed five cups of water) so it could contain lots of salt or MSG.

Trufflin’ Cool — cold pasta with truffle oil, tiny scallops, shio kombu and ebiko — was flavourful and crunchy with the ebiko. Didn’t get thirsty after this.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105037721247650437680/reviews
