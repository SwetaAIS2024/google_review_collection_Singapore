The question is: do you REALLY WANT that in the morning?\n\nPerhaps they have their fan base but over the last five years since I started coming to the Teban market, I have yet  to see ant long queues or crying customers.\n\nMaybe I am not there at the right time. But they still around. That means business can't be bad",
