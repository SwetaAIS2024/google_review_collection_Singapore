It was good.\n\nDidn't eat my siew mai cause my daughter finished them all, it took quite a while for the steamed order to come so didn't feel like ordering more.\n\nThe staff was friendly, it was raining outside and borrowed an umbrella to get to my car.",

      "text": "Hard to find a Dimsum place that opens 24 hours but this. I went on a weekday morning and there are plenty of seats. I do see that most patrons are tourists living around the vicinity.\n\nThe dim sum here is just mediocre; the very basis of dim sum -Har gow and Siew Mai - did not appeal to me at all. While it is understandable that most of the dim sums are not made freshly on the spot but from some central kitchen, somehow both do not taste as good.\n\nThe steamed carrot cake is too soft to my liking; breaks easily upon gripping with the chopsticks. The bean curd roll in Thai sauce does not taste good; probably the sauce is not fresh.\n\nOn the contrary, the spinach dumpling and scallop dumpling are both quite tasty but not the crystal chives dumpling; too soft like it has been over-steamed.\n\nThe fried dim sum did not get too wrong for the fried wanton and yam pastry with meat filling appeared to be the best dishes among all.\n\nApart from the reasonable price and the 24-hour convenience, a second visit for me may not happen in the near future. Perhaps, I may try the other dim sums on the menu on my next visit, hopefully it may change my perception on this dim sum establishment.",
