Bertrand Low,1,"If you are enrolling your child to PG, ensure your child is able to walk independently.
My child was not able to do so and needed some guidance by just holding one hand to walk. As a result on day 1 of orientation, I was strongly advised/forced by the teachers to withdraw and back to waiting list .

Principal backed up the teachers citing safety and the child ( who just turned 18 months) has to be independent enough to carry out daily activities .

Day 2 orientation, I had to make the hard decision to withdraw because the teachers seem to ignore my child because of his inability to walk independently.

After withdrawing , I went to other playgroups (not MFS) to enquire even asking if walking independently is a requirement . All mentioned it is not as it can be gradually learnt while in the PG. In the end managed to enrol my child to another PG who has the patience to take care and guide my child.

Conclusion : Please for the sake of your child ,  consider carefully first before enrolling . I would like to highlight other MFS branches do not have these funny requirements .
