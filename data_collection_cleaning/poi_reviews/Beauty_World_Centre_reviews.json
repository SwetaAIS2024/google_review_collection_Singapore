Located at Level 4, I enjoyed the wide variety of popular food available here but having issues with the environment, it can be extremely warm & ventilation was not on par with the food offered here. Despite the limited fan installed at this food court, I am seeing patrons queuing in almost every stall. Some popular stalls generated snake long queue. I wish the management can consider improving our dining experience with added installation of air conditioners or even fans.",

This mall offers a lot of options when it comes to shop variety: grocery, bakeshops, food, tuition centres, stationery, massage, beauty and wellness, even fortune telling! Despite its age, it is still very much alive and not short of mallgoers.",

There are various snacks and drinks available, so you can choose something that suits your taste. I think you can refresh yourself and recharge your energy with a short break. I hope you have a good day.",
