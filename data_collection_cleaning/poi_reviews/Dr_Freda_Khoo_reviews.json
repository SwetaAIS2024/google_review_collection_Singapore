Dr Freda was patient, loving and precise during her consultations. Waiting time was usually quick during lunch timing slots! Overall, a very comforting experience from start to birthing process! Would recommend Dr Freda to anyone looking for a female gynae :)",

We felt so calm throughout the pregnancy knowing we were in good hands. She would patiently answer all our questions and never disregarded any of the “silly”concerns we had. Even her staff Eileen and Shannon are very personable and would always greet us with a smile. Wait time can be a bit longer sometimes as she does have a lot of patients but once you’re with the Dr she never rushes you.",

She is also reassuring and patient in listening to my concerns. I was able to have a smooth experience due to her clear and firm advice especially at time of delivery. Shannon and Eileen at the reception are always friendly and helpful, they are also prompt in responding to my emails whenever I require assistance. Overall a very pleasant experience and will recommend to anyone who is looking for female gynae!",
