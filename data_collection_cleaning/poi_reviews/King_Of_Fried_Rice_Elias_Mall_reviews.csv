ÈòøÂÆù,2,"Went to Elias Mall regularly but didn‚Äôt get a chance to eat the fried rice from this King of Fried Rice‚Ä¶

Sometime, it is probably best to let things be as it is‚Ä¶ & not to draw too close‚Ä¶

My 1st order experience with King of Fried Rice was quite bad‚Ä¶ of course, I was not the first customer who received the rude & impatience treatment üòì

The staff are probably overworked as the queue never stop & I can imagine how warm & uncomfortable to continue working in front of the heated wok, non-stop.

The fried rice taste good, but in terms of customer service, there is definitely room for improvement.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
Joshua Lee,4,"simply good comfort fried rice. not the best but does the job. the chili enhances the flavour a lot more so unless you can take spice, wouldn‚Äôt really recommend.
I‚Äôve been a regular for years the chef and staff all recognises me so i didn‚Äôt get any bad service.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116084055498065151187/reviews
Patrick Lai (Faderaddict),1,"Visited the this outlet, wanted to order food for my staff. Total of 15 packs

Was told off by the ‚Äúchef‚Äù with the following comment rudely: ‚Äú Who would place order for so many packets at one go. How am I going to manage???!!!‚Äù

This is the first encounter at a King of Fried Rice outlet. Have been eating and ordering online.

Please kindly look into the attitude of the staf at this outlet.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118000770484113502046/reviews
Jacob TAN,4,"Craving for fried rice and went to Elias Mall to pack back for sharing. The fried rice is nicely done and the rice grains do not stick together. I like that they use the short grain rice. However, the wok hey is not as strong here.
The pork chop is tender and flavourful. The colour of the pork chop is nicely browned and so attractive. Nice taste.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
