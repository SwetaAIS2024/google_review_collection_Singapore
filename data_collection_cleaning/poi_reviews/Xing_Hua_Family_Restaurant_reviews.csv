Sheue Lin Ng,4,"Dishes are individual portions. Good to share for 2 pax or solo diner. This place serves delicious food that is easy on the pocket!
The pork ribs with lychee are good.  The chilli sauce on the table is spicy! It goes well with noodles, meat, etc.
Will be back to try other dishes.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100782595262033627690/reviews
Hiang Ar,4,"Food: The standout dishes include lor mee, seaweed soup, side dishes (seaweed and pickled cauliflower). They are generous with the amount of seaweed on the soup and it‚Äôs not oily. The lor mee gravy is thick and savoury which coat the noodles well. The balance of dishes  can be enhanced with their homemade chili sauce.

Atmosphere: The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, making it a great spot for both family meals and casual dining.

Service: While the food is generally well-received, the staff can be inattentive, especially during busy times.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101185220797498251612/reviews
