Debbie T,1,"Meal and service were mediocre. Lala was not fresh, had a slimy taste to it. Some of the vegetables had blackened stems too. Our first pot charred as the staff had forgotten to come back to it after adding oil and insisted that it was still okay to consume so they added the clams in and tried to cook the broth. Charred bits floated up before they realised they had to change it for us.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109678609257574932822/reviews
I liEk PoTaToEs ÙvÚ,5,"Love their signature dishes! Tasty soup with fresh seafood and ingredients. Service is great as well with a self service station for a variety of condiments as well as bowls and utensils. The only issue is that the foodcourt interior is hot when you dine in as the fan and ventilation are not cooling enough, so be prepared to sweat if you dine there on a hot day. Waiting time is decent. Parking is easy. I will definitely tabao their signature dishes again.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117174534983466318951/reviews
Darren Rafeal Tan,5,"Savoury goodness of Big Head Lalapot! The flavors were incredibly rich and depthful, with a perfect balance.

The portion was generous, and the quality of the ingredients was evident. Service was friendly and prompt.

Overall, Big Head Lalapot has won me over with its delicious, authentic flavors. Highly recommend!

Nested in a suburbans area of Tampines North. Good for family and friends looking to have a meal together.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113355206119605809063/reviews
Christopher Tang,3,"3/5. Had late night dinner with my spouse who ordered lala noodles, and me the prawn lala noodles. Pros - the lala portion was relatively generous for both (~15 pcs). Prawn mee broth was deep bodied and flavourful. Garlic added helps complement the briny lala taste. It is an acquired taste so please tell cook not to add if you do not like it.

Cons - Prawn noodles were undercooked to the point of being hard to chew through. For the price of $9 - $10 a bowl - the value is slightly tough to justify for hawker fare.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112303180533999917446/reviews
Song Hui,5,"$8.80

Consist of 16 Lala (Heavy type shell one. I prefer the lighter shell type). 3 pics of daopok skin and few stems of vegetable.

Soup can taste diced fried garlic, stripes of ginger, a hint of hua Xiao jiu and Lala taste is there too. The taste of these 4 ingredients are proportion equally. Meaning if you preferred Hua Diao Jiu to be sharp flavoured, I think sadly u will be disappointed.

Condiments they placed separately. Many types for you to choose, take and mixed yrself.

For verdict, please try it yourself! Hahah

WARNING: do not sit inside if you eat this. I am sweating like hell.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102889091147091208541/reviews
