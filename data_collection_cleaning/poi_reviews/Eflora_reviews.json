I came in last minute wanting to get a bouquet for my aunt’s birthday that’s today and she gave me the liberty to choose the flowers and the colour scheme I want which is really nice and even added more leaves and just made the flower arrangement incredible. She’s been working at e flora for about 45 years and is truly the sweetest lady ever :)\nGetting a bouquet like this online or even in stores are usually $100+ on average, sometimes even more but I got this for $60 and considering the fact that she made this arrangement on the spot - $60 really is an amazing price.",
