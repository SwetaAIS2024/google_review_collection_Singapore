Forest BK,4,"🐕A spacious Dog Run that is on a natural slope at Tampines Boulevard Park East.
🐕‍🦺A gravel paved path leads to the Dog Run.
☀️Best to visit in the morning or late afternoon, as it can be a little sunny.
🌿The newly planted surrounding trees are still young.
🐈The Dog Run is on top of a pristine grassy mound that offers panoramic view of the entire Park.
🌴The ambience is peaceful and tranquil.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
