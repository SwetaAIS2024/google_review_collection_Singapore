MrA,4,"Beautiful. One of the best parks in Singapore. There are many joggers and cyclists. Nearby residents like to bring their dogs for a walk too.

I urge NParks to maintain it and do not allow the upcoming condo developments ruin it. We need a lot of clean and green space for a healthy environment.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112008289267740134602/reviews
