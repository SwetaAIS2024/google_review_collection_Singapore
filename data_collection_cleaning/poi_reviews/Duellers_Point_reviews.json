I went to request the shop owner to help me rectify the problem, but from their attitude, it seems like they are not willingly to do anything to help rectify the problem.\n\nIt is their fault for not updating the system properly and as a good shop owner, they should help out the customer in anyway they can becoz it's they fault.\n\nI know MTG is their main income and other TCG is not and that's probably why they have such an attitude for this issue.\n\nPlus they are also more expensive compared to other LGS. They charged $85 for Gundam Card Game Beta Box while all other shops only charged $80.\n\nThink trice before spending your money here. If you ever encounter any issue, you can be sure they will just push you away with no intention to assist.",
