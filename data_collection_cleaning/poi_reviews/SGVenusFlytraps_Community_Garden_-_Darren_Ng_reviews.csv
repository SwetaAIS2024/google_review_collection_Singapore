Tey Ser Ling,1,"While Darren‚Äôs passion and never-say-die spirit are admirable, I can‚Äôt say the same about his integrity‚Äîor lack thereof. I attended the workshop yesterday, excited to make a terrarium and engage in ‚Äúa lot more hands-on activities.‚Äù Unfortunately, that excitement quickly turned into disappointment.

The so-called terrarium workshop amounted to little more than using tweezers to transfer a sapling into a slightly larger bowl‚Äîonly if I was willing to upgrade to their premium package. By 4:50 PM, the actual workshop still hadn‚Äôt begun, and ultimately, there was no workshop to speak of.

As evident from the promotional messages, the event failed to deliver on its promises. For $99, sitting through a 1.5-hour lecture was torturous for my nephew. The garden tour? Underwhelming‚Äîsmall, hot, and uninspired. We spent the entire time perched on stools in an uncomfortable setup.

If I didn‚Äôt want the premium Evo trap bowl, my only other option was a $55 starter plant (already included in the package), as shown in picture 3. Naturally, more $$$ could be forked out for a ‚Äúmore sophisticated‚Äù kit.

I have no issue with Darren‚Äôs desire to share knowledge, but the lack of transparency was incredibly disappointing. I sincerely hope to receive a refund.

This whole experience felt like a Venus flytrap‚Äîand we were the unsuspecting insects.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109038653574664882032/reviews
Terry Wong,5,We have a wonderful time and enjoyed the session learning all about carnivorous plants. We bought the elite set and were excited to grew our own plants. I like the enthusiasm from the team and founder Darren sharing and teaching us how to maintain and grew our plants.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112304966893076721693/reviews

Phyllis Teo,1,"I will try to make this review as impartial as possible. There were some good things - like how informative and engaging they were during the workshop - but overall I felt they were not upfront with their workshop/packages and their service standard is haphazard.

Attended this workshop in December 2023 (which is blatantly targeted towards families with young children) about a month ago with a friend under the Trio Starter Kit package and was expecting good things. Saw some not so positive reviews prior but hoped that they had improved since then. During the first half of the workshop, all was fun and good. I also really enjoyed the garden tour too. But subsequently, the upselling and sales pitching by the company‚Äôs founder and facilitator started.

My friend and I thought we would at least leave with a terrarium because of what was marketed on the pamphlet (refer to picture 1). But in the end we were only entitled to a pathetic funnel
cup of saplings that would never mature (unless we REALLY knew what we were doing) and a ‚Äúcash voucher‚Äù as part of the package paid which we had to utilise on the day itself. So we had the option to use it to offset the cost for the terrarium and lamp towards the end of the workshop. These cost a couple hundred dollars at least and the price chart attached amongst the rest of the photos has been drastically lowballed. While I ended up foolishly paying for a Pro series and topped up another $300+ (even after offsetting the ‚Äúcash voucher‚Äù), I truly regret it even until today because it‚Äôs not worth it. And it really wouldn‚Äôt be fair for families who aren‚Äôt able to afford it after having spent so much on the workshop already. The way they baited people into paying more to use their voucher and false marketing about the takeaways are really unethical.

While the terrarium with the lamp system has been rather low maintenance as promised, I would still request for a refund if I could. Thinking their after sales service would be top notch as they had claimed during the workshop, I was terribly disappointed when I had to head down today to replace one of my plants that wasn‚Äôt doing too well. I waited till well past their lunch time (1 hour to be exact üôÉ) and was greeted by someone nonchalantly. He did replace my problematic plant rather quickly and answered some of my other questions and even offered a free plant to make up for making me wait for so long. But I turned him down as a result of my seething rage and because i really just wanted nothing else to do with them.

To the other adults who had negative experiences, thank you for speaking up. To the company: while the majority of your reviews have been positive, there is so much more potential if you are upfront and more empathetic about your prices and takeaways before people actually sign up. 8 months later and my plants are on the verge of dying due to mould and fungus spreading. And I cannot bring myself to head back to your garden to get it ‚Äúfixed‚Äù because I just don‚Äôt want to be part of this hoax anymore. ü•≤",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107482337755499786923/reviews
