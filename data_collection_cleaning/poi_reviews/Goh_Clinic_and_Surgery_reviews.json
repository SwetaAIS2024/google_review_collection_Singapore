He's very thorough, asking detailed questions that sometimes feel a bit intrusive but I feel it's necessary questions to be asked. However, I understand that his probing is driven by a desire to get a complete picture of my health. I appreciate his dedication to finding the right diagnosis and providing effective treatment. Once you get to know Dr. Goh, you'll come to realize he's actually caring at heart.",

After seeing him a couple times after starting on very routine and regular medication, Dr Goh has successfully helped me to regain my appetite (fixed my appetite and hunger timings). Throughout this semi-term medication to readjust my stomach’s acids, I have also learned how to have a better outlook towards eating. I don’t have an eating disorder but my hunger and appetite were very out of sorts. This in turn, eased my anxiety and helped me to get better. To this date, I am still doing very well!",
