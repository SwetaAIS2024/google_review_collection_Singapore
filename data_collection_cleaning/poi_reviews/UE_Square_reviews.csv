We review,3,"This mall is pretty quiet in the day. There are restaurants, a bar and a cafe here for dining. There is also a convenience store, which I guess gets most of its patron from nearby drinking establishments at night or from the nearby offices and condos. There are other beauty facilities like haircut, nails and massage, but they look quiet too. Nothing much to see but a short 3 mins walk from Fort Canning MRT.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101387943070592425719/reviews
