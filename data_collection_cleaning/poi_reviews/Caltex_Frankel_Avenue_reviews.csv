Hardi Dejanaiero,1,"Bad experience with the malay lady cashier.  Impatient and doesn't care to explain much before proceeding to deduct my vouchers. The old chinese manager manager also doesn't care much. Just wanna deduct all my vouchers for petrol b4 implying my discounts. When asked, the pitch rose up.
Had been to few other Caltex outlets and never had this experience before.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110370358503552154800/reviews
Eunice Lim,5,"Wow I’m so impressed with the service at this Caltex. I was greeted warmly by the staff and one even held the door open for me. Friendliness and kindness like this doesn’t come easily in the Singapore service industry, therefore I was very very surprise and was questioning if I was dreaming. It was an amazing experience and I’d like to compliment the staff working at 9.55am on 16 Jan 2025. What a great way to start my day!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102371317206826768033/reviews
Chop Chop,5,"The lady who attended to me were patient and courteous. Most of the time, the petrol charges were paid by my husband or my son. But yesterday 09 Nov at about 10pm, i had to top up the tank as it was running low. The lady on duty assisted me on my apps (inactive as i seldom use) and payment. She was the most friendly and helpful customer service staff i have met. Thank you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117229793184050245929/reviews
Pak Jon,1,"Horrendous experience at this petrol station's workshop. Technician, Khoo Wea Meng, was impatient and unprofessional. Price seemed high.
My sliding car door was opened, stuck a pillar and could not close. I asked for 2nd hand parts. Wea Meng quoted S$1,485 saying his suppliers could only supply an entire door at 1k+.
A quick search on Carousel had door motors at $100. He gave a curt response telling me to go buy the parts myself then send it to him to use. Unbelievable. His reluctance to source.
To save money, only the brackets was to be changed. Imagine my surprise, when Wea Meng then said the old motor should still work.
Now my door opens but with a loud cracking sound. The failure to replace the motor and locking mechanism was blamed.
Please avoid this workshop, for your peace of mind.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116244226881752846993/reviews
Stuart Lim,5,"Staff are very friendly, and open 24hrs. Take note air pump use is disallowed after 10:30pm due to complaints from surrounding houses about the loud beeping noise it makes. There is also a small tyre shop and a small servicing workshop housed in the same compound if you ever need their services.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116839128670815456215/reviews
