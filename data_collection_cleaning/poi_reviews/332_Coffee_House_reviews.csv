Einnwad N,1,"The Ah Ma Fried Kway Teow Carrot cake really cannot make it. It's cold and cooked in 20s. I think she pre fry and just serve.  Still tried to sell the higher priced version to me.

But the horfun from zichar stall is good!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105258478898800596166/reviews
Ron Ng,4,"1st post (couldn't locate the shop under Google, will update when I can)
Here for lunch, and I couldn't forget the 1st time having the Mee Hoon Kuay. For Mee Hoon Kuay lovers, you will prefer the Kuay pinch by hand and littered into the soup, that's how it is served here. The texture that you have on a hand pinched against the machine rolled is vastly different as you will be able to enjoy the mushy and chewy texture on the piece of Kuay. The bowl comes with Kuay, spinach, fried Ikan Billis and minced pork.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102898821791109530498/reviews
Alvin Ang,1,"You can dine at the coffeeshop BUT PLEASE bring your own drink, especially hot drinks! You can finish eating your food, your drinks not there yet. The slowest make coffee Uncle in this island. The worse thing is that the owner of the coffee shop is not even there! Hire a bunch of cheap and useless workers.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115172277964488882765/reviews

Ojisan ‚ÄúHiroshi‚Äù,4,"Came here because Sarah Ow did a promotion video for them.

First of all, this coffeeshop is clean, spacious and windy, I like. And seems like it offers many stalls which serves good tasting food.

The popiah $2, was good enough for me and the Roast meat stall looks super yummy.

Tried the new Ramen stall. And here‚Äôs my verdict about Shinjitsu vs any other  established ramen ya (and not vs other coffeeshop ramen).

1. Price is definitely much lower than any ramen restaurant. Tonkutsu ramen at $6.80 while special Tonkutsu is $10.80 which offers more ingredients, which is 1piece of nori, 1 slice of chasiew and 1 ajitama tamago.

2. Tonkutsu soup is rich enough, but can be saltier to give more impact. (Then again this is up to individuals). But definitely better than Tagaki ramen‚Äôs.

3. Their teriyaki chicken $5 is the usual decent standard.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112623517876975514039/reviews
