Waitress who waited on our table was enthusiastic to recommend dishes suitable for both young and old and she was spot on. The family enjoyed the dinner ðŸ˜Š $320++ for 8 pax which was worth it for the quality. Downside is that we were seated next a table of avid drinkers who could share their conversation from across the table occasionally.",

We enjoyed 3tdpw dishes albeit the Claypot Rice and Volcano chicken were on the high side.\n\nEspecially loved the curry fish head and Ireland Fat Duck. The fish was smooth and curry texture just nice. Not too thick not too blend. Fat duck skin was crispy and the meat juicy and tasty.\n\nIf you know what to order this place will definitely be a delight for you. Plenty of whisky selection too.",

      "text": "We thought of heading to this nostalgic restaurant for old times' sake and 'The Famous Restaurant', in our opinion, was famous in our minds for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe food was really superficial. In fact, some kopitiam had better tasting dishes,  and the price came out to be nearly $300 for 7 of us.\n\nThough the service by the waitress was fantastic,  the chef was really stubborn to insist that the fish we ate had no fishy smell. All 7 of us tasted that awful taste, yet he insisted that it was normal.\n\nIt's definitely not worth a second visit. Might have been famous in the past, but definitely, the standard had dropped.",

Noodles too soft for our liking. But the wok hei and taste was spot on.\n\nWould come again to try other dishes.",
