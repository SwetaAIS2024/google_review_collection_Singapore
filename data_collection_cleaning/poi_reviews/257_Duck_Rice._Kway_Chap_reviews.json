The Braised sauce/gravy is rich & savory. Tje Kuay is cooked just nice! The portion we ordered for 2pax cost $12.\n\nMy wife finds it will be perfect if it is garnish with some coriander leaves.",

      "text": "It’s reasonably priced at $3.50 for the kway chap. It comes with a generous bowl of kway. The intestines, dou pok and two halves of an egg were not soaked in the lor sauce long enough as the colour was slightly dark. On the other hand, it’s “healthier” as it is not that salty if you soak it long. Personally I prefer the darker shade.",
