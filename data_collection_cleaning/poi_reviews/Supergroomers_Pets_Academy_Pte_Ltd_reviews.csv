Sharon Soon,5,"I took up the professional grooming course (class C) at SuperGroomers and had an amazing experience! Michelle is an exceptional instructor - she is incredibly patient, pays dedicated attention to each student, and goes out of her way to correct our weaknesses while sharing her vast knowledge to ensure that her students learn the right technique to groom dogs safely.

If you're looking to develop your pet grooming skills, I canâ€™t recommend SuperGroomers enough. Thank you, Michelle, for inspiring and guiding me on this grooming journey!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105826472209854408119/reviews
Ho Leong khit,5,"My teacher Michelle is most willing to share her experience on what to look at/ look out for when cutting.

Her unique teaching style / methodology involves drawing, taking notes on steps/procedure of how to cut, brushing dummy fur, scissoring, etc.

She is also pinpoint any technical issues that i faced and focus on improving my weak points.

Her teaching has enabled me to pass my Class C in 7 months.

Thank you Michelle!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107636579106519352924/reviews

EUNICE NG,5,"Who knew pet grooming is'nt as easy as what the aunties and uncles say it would be ""cut only ma?""
After years in my former industry, I decided to make a change
SGPA provided me with a Class C course and I graduated in three months. Now I am able to find a more rewarding job.
Learning took place in an environment that was bright, clean, and conducive to a positive learning experience.
My classes at Michelle's were always full, and she makes sure she targets all of our weaknesses and gives us her full attention. Throughout the grooming process, Michelle provides a safe environment for us learners and our model dogs.
Michelle's constant reassurances extended beyond the classroom, she also showed concern and care for our personal lives as well.
The staff JiaYi, JiaXuan, Paula and Alvin were also very helpful. Despite the approaching Class C examination, they made sure my time there was enjoyable.
I will definitely be back to further my skill set.
Thank you SuperGroomers Pets Academy and MasMas Groomers.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116353563104060391084/reviews

I truly enjoyed the lessons as the teachers made it fun and engaging! Suitable for people who doesnâ€™t like to be micromanaged as the course allows you to learn at your own pace.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114971566726229569794/reviews
