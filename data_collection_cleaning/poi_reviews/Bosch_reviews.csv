Arul Nambi Ramanujam,4,"Good to see this place has transformed a lot and for good compared to 2008!
Also its very nice to see the bus stop in the name of Bosch! (not sure that its the regular practice in Sg!)

wish to see the bus stop branded with Bosch CI / products for the public!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101782418822644530234/reviews
