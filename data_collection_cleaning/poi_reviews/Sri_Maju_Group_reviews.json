Unfortunately the bus accident happened but the PIC of bus inform to us wait another bus. This bus finally comes on 12pm-12.30pm. I have waited 5hours at bus stop! This years I said with me that give them 1 chance, but they still delay. I can accept causes of traffic jam. This bus came but we all waited 10 to 20 minutes for a late person. I donâ€™t why we need used our time to wait for one person?!  For the management part is really bad. I don't think I'll ever take this bus again.",

      "text": "Today, we have lousy service and rude day time coach driver who ferried us from Genting. My aunt asked one of the driver is that the bus, he just showed his unhappy face and waved his hand.. when i asked one of the driver where are we having a meal, the driver just shout out YONG PENG.  When we reached toilet break, they also just shout unlike the night indian driver ao polite. Thw drivers talked loudly during the trip. We used to take this bus to and fro many times before covid. Now, bus won't drop us at the food area after leaving Genting so wondering there we going for lunch and gotten such reply. Will not take this bus next time. Night driver's are better and helpful. Polite and courteous. No wonder the review is bad. This will be our last ride with them.",
