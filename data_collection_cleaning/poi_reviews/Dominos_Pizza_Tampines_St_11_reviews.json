      "text": "Dear Domino's Pizza Team,\n\nI would like to start by expressing my appreciation for staying open on the public holiday, allowing customers like myself to enjoy a pizza on such a day. It’s great to see that you are catering to customers during this time.\n\nHowever, I wanted to provide feedback regarding my recent order. I placed my order at 17:42hrs, but to my surprise, my pizza was only placed in the oven at 18:24hrs, which was a significant delay. The pizza was eventually delivered at 18:40hrs, nearly an hour after I placed the order. I was particularly disappointed because Domino's has advertised a 30-minute delivery guarantee, and this was not met.\n\nWhen the pizza finally arrived, I noticed that the quality was subpar. To my disappointment, the pizza appeared slightly burnt, and the topping on my pepperoni pizza was extremely sparse and lacking the usual portion and quality I’ve come to expect from Domino's.\n\nI hope you can address these concerns, as I have always enjoyed ordering from Domino's in the past. It would be great to see improvements in delivery times and the consistency of pizza quality.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.",

      "text": "I ordered two pizzas with extra toppings, ultimate Hawaiian with extra cheese and cheesy crust, they sent me a normal pepperoni pizza with normal crust. Prawn Alfredo was correct though.\n\nThe guy who sent it here under the heavy rain was good and prompt. But I have issues with the kitchen staff. There's about 12 dollars worth of upgrade not delivered to me.\n\nI have the receipt and pictures for your reference.\n\nWhere can I get a refund for your mistakes??? There's no telephone line... There's nothing for me to feedback.",

They are so quick to charge for the order. Tampines st 11 store please don’t order from there. Ridiculous service. And this is not the first time. No voucher no refund and can’t even cancel the order. Pathetically exploited the customer",
