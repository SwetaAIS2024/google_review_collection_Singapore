Kevin Arbury,5,"A really lovely hotel very convenient for an arrival or departure at Changi airport as the train is a 5 minute walk away. Beautiful hotel - very clean reception area on arrival. Really interesting metal art work on the walls.
Our room was large and very comfortable and clean. A great shower! We will use this hotel again when returning to Singapore",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101631107510237448865/reviews
Noriko Furuya,4,"Extremely convenient location if you have an overnight layover in Changi Airport.
It is attached to a shopping center that has many restaurants, stores and a Fairprice supermarket.  Spacious rooms with kitchenettes .",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105337731333448307168/reviews
Aaron Tan Eng Hwee,5,"The rooms are clean, and the service staff are very friendly and helpful as well.

Rooms are also spacious considering the price. Likely due to the location being abit further away from central.

If you aren't looking to travel to the central frequently, and maybe looking to explore around the east of singapore, I'd highly recommend this hotel",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105348786114820177812/reviews
Hiang Ar,5,"The rooms were modern and spacious, featuring a contemporary design with comfortable furnishings. I appreciated the amenities, including a well-equipped kitchenette and a cozy seating area, which made my stay even more enjoyable. Check-in and check-out were smooth. The hotel boasts great facilities, including a well-maintained gym, a refreshing pool, and a stylish lounge area. There is Changi City Point nearby and NTUC supermarket.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101185220797498251612/reviews
