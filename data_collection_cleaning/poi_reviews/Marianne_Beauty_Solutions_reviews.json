      "text": "I first stepped into MB in my early 20s when my acne was causing me to lose my confidence. I took a leap of faith because I had no recommendation from anyone on whether MB was any good or whether they were out to dupe me. 10 years on, I'm still going back there for facials and skincare products and massages because the owner Julie and her team understands my skin and I've seen results. It's not easy trusting a beauty salon but the team has shown that they are committed to providing quality care. This is not a sponsored post but rather to share my experience and to give a shoutout to this nondescript salon in the heartlands that have helped me so much over the years. Thank you Julie (:",

At every stage, I know I could depend on them to help my skin.\n\nI am satisfied with my face contour, reduced pigmentation and expression lines reduced.
