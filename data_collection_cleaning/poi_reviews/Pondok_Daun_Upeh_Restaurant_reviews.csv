Muhammad Hidayat,2,"Portion is quite a lot and quite a wide range of dishes. However, twice we bought their large sotong around 640 PM and both times, it has already spoilt. Price is on the higher side so it's truly upsetting

Edit: The spoilt gravy was poured on the rice making the rice inedible too",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100107339314192270188/reviews
Adam Gazari,4,"The flavors hit all the right notes with a balance of spicy, sweet, and tangy, which makes each bite interesting. However, the texture of the kway teow itself was a bit too mushy for my taste might be okay for some, but I prefer it with a bit more bite. The serving size was just right, so no complaints there.
Service was decent and efficient, but the coffeeshop could use some better ventilation; it was pretty warm, which might make dining in less comfortable on a hot day. Overall, decent but could be improved on texture!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100331608463018382443/reviews
Hidayat Esa,5,"The price was reasonable.
Food tasted nice and delicious.
I came here at around 2pm and there is still quite alot of dishes.

The staff were friendly and generous in giving the portion of food.
Highly recommended to try out.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116505395736650043657/reviews
Sze Ling Ng,3,"I had ordered nasi parang with beef rendang, chili quail egg and begerdil. Total costs $8. My hubby ordered nasi lemak which is $7. He found his fried egg with a big piece of egg shell. See attached photo. Portion was decent but expected rice not to be so mushy. Think it is over priced for a coffee shop stall",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101338709689964992641/reviews
