Leah Jones-Crank,4,"Went on a vertical farm tour and it was cool to learn about their approach to vertical farming that emphasizes sustainability through low water usage, recycled nutrients for fertilizer, and limiting carbon emissions. However, the price was high for the tour ($50 for a 1.5 hour tour at time of writing), even compared to other vertical farms in the area. Also, there is not public transit directly to the facility so you will need to taxi (from the Kranji MRT is closest) or drive.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111548224593582085686/reviews
Jim Faherty,5,"Awesome vertical farming in a forgotten corner of Singapore.
I came here for a tour of the facilities; what these guys are doing is really terrific and it's a shame there is such little government support for this kind of innovative farming, especially in Singapore which imports 90% of ALL its food.
