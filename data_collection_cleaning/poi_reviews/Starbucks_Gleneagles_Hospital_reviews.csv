Mabel Ng,5,"Went to Starbucks for lunch after my MRI procedure. The (male) Indian staff who attended to me is really kind, he kindly send the drink to me (instead of calling out my name) I believe he noticed the plaster on my hand.

During my meal I noticed a staff delivered the food direct to the table for lady with walking aids.

I want to shout out to the staff in Gleneagles Starbucks demonstrating great empathy for customers and go above standard process to serve their customers",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101936285212981057592/reviews

Chris SG,5,Staff was really kind to help me with my mobile order (in order to use the 50% discount) and also heated up my chicken pie even though I didn't ask for it (it was for a take away). Super nice gesture and thanks for the fast service too!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118301042945741620173/reviews
Tot2travel WP,3,"Value breakfast set for $7.90. Tables were clean.

Better if my order is called when the whole set is ready.

By 830am the approximate 10 seatings here are close to fully occupied.

Aircon today is pretty chilly, probably due to morning rain too.

Personally, the ingredients for the Turkey ham Pita is somewhat salty.

Had a fly landed on the rim of my cup ü§®",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109058897885515300830/reviews
