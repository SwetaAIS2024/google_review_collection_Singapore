Lynette T,1,"Horrible customer service. I was so happy to find a store in T1 to be able to get souvenirs for friends back home. I was selecting some packets of prepackaged ba kwas and was told that I am only able to purchase the fresh ones because the system is down and I would be charged more. I asked how much more and the guy said maybe 5-6 dollars more per pack.

When I was paying at the cashier and waiting them to package the fresh ones, some other tourists came in and were looking at the big packets of prepackaged ones and the guy did not say anything about the system being down. I asked  if those packets can be purchased and he said nodded and I questioned  because I was absolutely confused and he said again that we can only buy the fresh ones. What rubbish??

Why wasn’t there a sign that said the system was down and only the fresh ones are being sold?  And why are they even in display??

Absolutely disappointed with the service!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106201579728033591462/reviews
Jx Z,1,"Very bad experience. There was a very rude cashier. I asked why the price she wanna charge me is different from what they marked. She asked me in a very impolite way for what I want to buy. After I requested she open the sealed bag to check the 肉干 I buy was the kind that I mentioned and found the price was wrong, she still acted as I was doing wrong. And she dropped everything in a loud way to show her unhappiness.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117492138085901375231/reviews
