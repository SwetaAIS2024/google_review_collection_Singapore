      "text": "Nestled in the second level of an unassuming shophouse. Dragged our feet over grudgingly after Peach Garden told us of their full house situation with their Dim Sum deal.\n\nAnyways, I think Yum Cha deserves their own review. Dim Sum is generally pricier (each around $6.80++). But I think for what's paid you get something of value.\n\nmain stars were the fried prawn roll and the sour spicy dumplings. I felt the Siew Mai was decent, definitely better than the Har Gao.\n\nOn a Saturday late noon, there was hardly any people. Nice interior, seemed to stick close to Chinese tradition.\n\nService wise, I applaud them for hiring older staff. Had an old man served us, waited a bit but he was very polite - honestly enjoyed his service.\n\nOverall, I wouldnt say its out of this world. Its definitely good, but the food doesnt hit that hard when its $6.80 for 1. I would say it didn't disappoint, but I don't think its super worth what I paid.\n\nOverall, a strong 4 ⭐️",

      "text": "My GF suggested this for a like dinner. My fault that I tend to go overboard with ordering. Also this place brings back nostalgic memories for her. So let's go!\n\nOrdered the egg tart, shrimp dumpling, charsiew rice roll, chive dumplings, fried prawn wrap, charsiew buns and pork ribs. We had a pot of Jasmine tea.\n\nFood is pretty good except for the pork ribs which is boneless. Doesn't quit register for me as pork ribs usually comes attached to a piece of bone. Charsiew bun is good and so were the egg tarts.\n\nIt's a quick in-and-out dinner and then we went to stroll Chinatown. The restaurant wasn't crowded and we just walked in literally.",

I particularly appreciate the restaurant owner's contribution to society by hiring older employees👍🏻. The staff's service is excellent, polite, enthusiastic, and warm, creating a friendly atmosphere🫶🏻.\n\nAs for the dim sum, several dishes here are definitely worth trying.\n👍🏻Fried carrot cake （臘味萝卜糕）：is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside;\n👍🏻Ma Lai Gao (马来糕）：brown sugar sweetness is just right, texture is perfectly soft & fluffy;\n👍🏻Baked mini egg tarts(酥皮蛋挞仔) have a rich, full flavor. 👍🏻Paper chicken wings(纸包鸡）：traditional preparation that’s hard to find in other restaurants these days.\nThis was my first time trying them, and they have a unique, old-fashioned flavor that I highly recommend.\n\nOverall, this place has a nostalgic atmosphere, and the food not only retains traditional flavors but is also accompanied by attentive service. It’s definitely a place worth trying!",

      "text": "Established in 2000, Yum Cha Restaurant offers a nostalgic dining experience with marble tables, wooden chairs, and a charming shophouse setting that recalls the feel of old-school dim sum parlours. It’s a lively spot that still features signature push carts — a nostalgic highlight, even though most items are now ordered via an online menu.\n\nIt was pretty packed during my visit, but service moved efficiently. The food was generally good, with some creative items like the Otak Siew Mai. The only minor disappointment was the XO Carrot Cake that was only so-so. Still, Yum Cha delivers a fun, varied dim sum experience with plenty of character. I’d rate it a 4 out of 5.",
