usman shaikh,5,"Such a lovely building and maintained and extremely neat clean mosque. Probably one the most nicest in the Singapore. At first glimpse it gave a feeling of a fairy tale place, architecture resembles Persian touch. Nice and cozy, lighting is also very good
Very small yet appealing. Just adjacent to Pay labor MRT, easily accessible from every direction.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112757541418460251428/reviews
Muhammad Abdullah,5,"Such a vibrant and welcoming masjid, the Aircon here is so comfortable and makes me come here often ‚Äî highly recommended to come here especially for Maghrib and Isyak prayers every night.

The young HƒÅfiz Imams recite the Qur‚Äôan with beautiful, soulful voices that truly touch the hearts of the jemaah and create a deep connection with the Qur‚Äôan. MƒÅshƒÅAllƒÅh, TabƒÅrakAllƒÅh. May Allah bless them. üòä",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104888398662330460722/reviews
Hayat,5,One of most active mosque in Singapore . They have the Quranbit platform where we can record our recitation and Ustazah will check and correct us when we make a mistake. And not to mentioned it is free to if we cannot afford . Of course if we are able to pay we should pay. And its not that pricey either. Its just right. It was $60 a month if im not mistaken.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103099105126435592783/reviews
meer,5,"Located nearby Paya Lebar MRT interchange.

Toilet is downstairs.

Air-conditioner mosque.

Got some free food for needs in the front at entrance. In the toilet, no signal at all. Berak while not playing phones is the boring-iest things ever.

The carpet in mosque is okay. Delicious to pray pray.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106965501845054584952/reviews
