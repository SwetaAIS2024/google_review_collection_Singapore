Grace,5,"Randomly chanced upon this Viet stall at a coffee shop in Bukit Merah and the food is amazing?! We had the pork chop rice and fried spring rollsâ€” both were so good, well-charred and exactly like the ones we enjoyed in Vietnam! These were probably the best we had in Singapore, very authentic. Thank you :)",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114596682117127210414/reviews
Ixac Tan,4,"I tried their pho before. This time is Vietnamese Spicy Beef Noodle Soup (Bun Bo Hue). Don't worry, it isn't spicy but rather on a sweet time in my opinion. The herbs make the broth more refreshing. Noodles are smooth, sliced beef are decent. Not bad",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113926848021086444235/reviews
Gopi Bala,5,"I happened to come across this stall and decided to try out their food. I ordered the pork chop with vermicelli.

The presentation of the food was good. After a good toss of the ingredients, I dug into the food.

The vermicelli was done perfectly right and it tasted good.

The pork chop was freshly grilled and it also tasted good, though it would have been even much better had it been more tender.

The accompanying fried spring roll was crunchy and the filling was awesome.

The stall provides you with more than sufficient condiments to suit your taste requirements.

Can't wait to try out the other dishes the next time I am in the neighborhood.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114775727475904526433/reviews
