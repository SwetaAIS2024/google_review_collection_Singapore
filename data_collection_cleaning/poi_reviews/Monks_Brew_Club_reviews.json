I had the crispy chicken with waffle and a filter coffee. The chicken came in 2 big pieces, I was so full after the meal! Fortunately, the ambience is also great for doing some focus work. I’ll definitely come back in the future to try more of the menu.\n\nPS: the salad dressing was so good! So refreshing!",

Thanks for making our morning memorable and an instagram-able one! Cant help but grabbed packets of their Ginger Lemon and Earl Grey tea sachets. Delightful aromas! Food served real quick here, they have broad choices on menu to pick from, we tried Smoked Salmon Avo Sourdough Toast, Fish & Chippies, and Steak Sandwich ( which, we requested for well-done since kids get a share too) all flavors on point, freshness guaranteed, well-done steak still tender and juicy. Great chef is in the house!",

      "text": "Comfort cafe in the hip tanjong katong area. Located near the main road and easy to locate just in front of the overhead bridge. A regular size cafe that is popular in the weekends. What is surprising is the food came in 5 mins from ordering and it is fresh and hot, wow. Amazing speed. Food quality is tasty and on spot. Try the tiramisu in its deconstructed form, good mix of cream and crunch. Servers are attentive but could be better than to ask customers to approach their counter to serve the desserts.",

      "text": "Such a nice cafe tucked away in Katong. This one is easy to miss as it’s right behind a walkover bridge.\n\nI came here on a Sunday morning around 11AM and there were still some seats to go around.\n\nService is pretty quick. I ordered the following -\n\n1) Cococcino - wanted to be experimental with my coffee. This is an espresso shot with coconut water. I really liked this combination. Served cold.\n\n2) Spicy Mocha - Lovely creamy mocha with pepper and cinnamon. Great for a rainy morning or if you want something to soothe your throat.\n\n3) Avocado Toast - Didn’t want something too heavy and this fit the bill. Chose the option with red pepper fries. I felt the sunny side up was slightly over fried on the edges, scrambled eggs would’ve gone better with this combination.\n\nAdd this to your Katong/Joo Chiat plan right away!",
