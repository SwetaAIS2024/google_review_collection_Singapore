Melanie Lee,5,"I would say this is 4.5 stars. Food is great but not amazing. Feels very homely.

We had the seafood soup in medium because the small didnt have prawn. The prawn was soso; I would go for small next time. I really love the soup though. Slightly sweet and goes great with the kway teow. I understand why some people would find it bland, but this is perfect for me. I think the fishball noodle uses the same soup base.

Fish cake is nice but nothing special. Goes well with chilli. Kaya toast is very homely - feels like something that we could make and eat at home - but not amazing.

Overall 4.5 stars for the food quality versus value. Wouldnt mind making a pitstop here again on the way to KL.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110645396744401343960/reviews

jenny ng,5,"Chanced upon this restoran when we wanted to find a place for motorbike wash. We ordered kueh teow dry and it was quite good. Price was very reasonable. Rm15 a bowl with noodle. We also ordered fish meat soup. The fish meat given was quite a lot, given RM 12 a bowl. But the soup is a little on the sweet side for me. The boss said he uses rock sugar which is healthier than normal sugar. I like savoury soup. Kopi C and Teh C kosong were good too. In fact the best ones I had in Bukit Indah, Eco botanic area.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118307665111198139105/reviews
Nick Chow,5,"Went to try on Christmas Day. Shop looks bright and clean.
Friendly staff. Lady Boss came to introduce their food. We ordered Fish Maw Soup, Homemade Fish Cake, Plain Noodles and Coffee.
Fish Cake came first, hot and freshly fried. Skin is chrispy.

Worried the Fish Maw Soup would taste ""too fishy"", surprised it is not. Soup is clear and quite tasty.

Wished the noodles could have been ""blacker"" as I love black noodles. But still taste ok and not ""over-cook"".

Though the Coffee are ""less sugar"", however, we felt ""milk"" is kind of more and the coffee still taste a little too sweet.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116932206428713287871/reviews
Mabby san,5,"Their seafood porridge was comforting and flavorful â€” perfect for a rainy day. But the real star of the show is the fish head steamboat â€” fresh, rich broth and generous portions.  Itâ€™s definitely a must-order dish if you're dining here. Friendly staff and decent prices too. Will be back for sure!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110477909319370685255/reviews
