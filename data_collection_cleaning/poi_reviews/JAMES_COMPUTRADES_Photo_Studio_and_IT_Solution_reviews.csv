Shahirah Slmt,1,"Uncle seems passive aggressive. My husband only wanted to do some lamination and uncle said ‚Äúok just stand there‚Äù. Uncle clarified with my husb about the number of papers to laminate and naturally ppl tend to take few steps forward when answering and he kept reminding my husb to stay at one spot. I on the other hand was browsing through the stationaries see if there‚Äôs anything to buy while waiting and he kept looking at me cautiously as if he‚Äôs suspicious of me. Like chill, man?? We waited outside instead bc we‚Äôre so annoyed. Seriously, don‚Äôt bother having a store at this point if you‚Äôre gonna act this way to your customers. No idea how this shop is still standing lmao.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112132647414985280692/reviews
