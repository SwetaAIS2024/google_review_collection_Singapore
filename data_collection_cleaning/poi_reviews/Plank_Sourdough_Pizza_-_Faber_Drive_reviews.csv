L L,5,"Can't go wrong with b&c, plank. Good for meals, whiling yr time away, only downside are the stools that don't encourage long sitting, for obv reasons. Eggs Benedict a tad too spicy today",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112091406558157982822/reviews

Jon Lau,5,Dropped by here for dinner and enjoyed the tranquility and peaceful ambience of the outlets at Faber Drive. The sourdough pizza at Plank was lovely and accompanying it with Baker & Cook's cream pasta was awesome. We had a flatwhite and the coffee aroma was commendable. The staff were friendly and the place was not too crowded although we did give up our spacious table for a larger party who would appreciate a larger table and more space. Happy with our meal here!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101664665401377179413/reviews
