Navodya Ekanayake,5,"Stayed here for three nights as a solo traveler . This is a great location for very reasonable price. The rooms are quite clean. There is a huge cat üêà‚Äç‚¨õ like a guardian, if you're a cat lover, ha ha.

One girl in the staff is very nice (wearing specs) , but there's another mean lady who is strict and disregarded me even at check-in. The customer service can definitely be improved.

They have unlimited tea and coffee, but no breakfast

You can walk around little India even at night. The Neighbourhood is very safe. There's a great seafood restaurant right in front which is open throughout 24 hours. Cute caf√©s and restaurants are abundant in the area if you are a food lover.

They have a washing machine and an iron , clean bathrooms, showers and sinks. The sleeping pods are pretty spacious. They have a charging point, a table, a mirror and a cool light.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100578310696094020306/reviews
Cherz,5,"There's no reception when i get there around 3 pm, the key with name of those who will checking in that day is prepared on top of reception table, nust find the one with your name.

The instruction is there, your room, bed number, key card for room, locker key.

The room is quiet and bit hot. The aircon is off from 3am to 7pm. There's big fan but still bit hot.

There's free coffee and tea all day, refrigerator, microwave and hot water free to used but clean up after yourself.

The shower, toilet, and wastafel is clean. They provide towel, shampoo, and soap.

Worth the price, very nice stay. Just need to be careful when moving in the pod, its quite small, and its plastic, so it makes noise.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109020148125701152979/reviews

Eddie Lam,5,"This hostel truly exceeded all expectations.
The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, the facilities are spotless, the location is perfect, and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming.
This place sets the bar high for hostels. I'm impressed by their commitment to cleanliness and the vibrant social environment.
I can't say enough good things about this hostel. It's like a home away from home, and I'll definitely be returning.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109027257581473946259/reviews
