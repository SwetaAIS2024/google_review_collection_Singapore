      "text": "I've been renting here a while and I do like the size of the units and proximity to bus stops. The market is also just opposite.\n\nHowever, units here are extremely old and come with a host of problems like endless leaks, mould and electricity tripping when there's thunder. Most of the rental units are like that as the owners are just keeping them for the rent, so be ready to spend a lot of time getting things fixed. Water supply also goes off without warning sometimes.\n\nGround floor units are nice but very problematic. Expect snakes and rats coming into your house regularly, especially for the units facing the back of the condo. The lifts are also extremely old and have not been changed since the condo was built.\n\nThere is also noise pollution and dust coming from Farrer Road.\n\nSome residents, especially the owners, here tend to be overly concerned with minor issues that donâ€™t directly affect them, such as items left outside doors, too many visitors or children playing near the gym.\n\nAs some of the units are big, they are rented out on a short term basis to multiple tenants, so you can expect to constantly see new residents all the time.",
