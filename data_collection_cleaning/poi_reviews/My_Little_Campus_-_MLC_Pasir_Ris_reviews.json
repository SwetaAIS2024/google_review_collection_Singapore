      "text": "Highly appreciated.\nMy first child has joined My Little Campus about 10 months ago when he was 2 years old. As a foreigner, I and my wife don’t know much about Singapore and the education program here. We had so worried at beginning to put him in school where the environment complete different from our origin country. But it was an amazing journey at My Little Campus for us since the first day still now.\nMy son has had the opportunity to engage in a diverse range of activities that have greatly contributed to his development. From learning colouring to mastering the skill of tracing letters, the curriculum has been thoughtfully designed to stimulate his creativity and fine motor skills. Equally important, the guidance provided on social interaction and playing with friends has helped him build essential social skills and team-play. I appreciate the well-rounded approach to education that the school provides, fostering not only academic growth but also valuable life skills.",

And make sure my girl is doing well in school during the first few weeks!",
