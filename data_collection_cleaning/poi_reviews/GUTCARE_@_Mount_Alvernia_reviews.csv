Sarath Kumar,5,"My mother had been experiencing gut issues, and we were fortunate to be referred to Dr. Mark Fernandez at GUTCARE @ Mount Alvernia. From the very first consultation, Dr. Fernandez was incredibly comforting, kind, and positive ‚Äî he made my mother feel completely at ease, which meant a lot to us.

What truly touched me was during our most recent visit, he waived the consultation fee after learning that my mother did not have insurance. It‚Äôs rare to come across such compassion and genuine care in today‚Äôs world, and I truly thank God for crossing paths with a doctor like him.

If we ever need help again, we know exactly who to go to. Highly recommend Dr. Fernandez for anyone seeking not just professional expertise, but also a doctor with heart.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107401533806618484624/reviews

Charles Low,5,"I had piles and requested for an urgent appointment with Dr Ho Gim Hin, who, together with his assistant, Karen, saw me the next day and then arranged for a procedure that matched my schedule. I am very grateful and appreciative of their care and professionalism. I suspect they went out of their way to help me even though they did not say so. But that is how they do their work and I think they deserve a great review. üëçüèºüòÅüëèüèº",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117772906724321920583/reviews
Reena Kaur,5,"I recently saw Dr. Chia after a liver ultrasound from my health screening showed a large growth, which was quite a scare. He was incredibly informative, taking the time to explain everything in detail and put me at ease. He‚Äôs friendly, down-to-earth, and never rushes through his explanations. I also had an MRI, which thankfully confirmed everything was okay. Huge thanks to Dr. Chia for his warmth, patience, and thoroughness‚ÄîI truly appreciate the care he provided!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111628593337887399870/reviews
