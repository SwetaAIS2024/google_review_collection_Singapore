If you're ever in need of a long, meditative pause in your day, Maybank has you covered.",

I mean you got 1 job only and fail terribly.\n\nWhen you see your team handling swarm of customer the least you can do is help abd see which area you can help DIY with customer.\n\nIve a few appointments ahead and it affect my work as it overshot my schedule.\n\nAnyway i wonder how customer that sign up savings, investment and insurance plan face this kind incompetent system. Imagine having to queue 2hrs everytime you have your financial review with your financial consultant if theres any.",
