However their policy to tidy up every 2 days doesnt look like green movement, but efficiency. I can accept no towel or sheet changing, but staying in a hotel you expect then to clean up,  make up the bed & take out trash.",

These make it very easy to get around the city. Vivo also has great food choices and Food Republic which is a Hawker style centre located on Level 3 close to the Sentosa Express station.",

      "text": "Mixed feelings about this place. Rooms are good, breakfast is good, but there are lot of simple issues with this place: The pool closes at 7pm, which is prime swimming time(no sun, still warm, good way to cool off, and after work hours). There is no instruction booklet as well, so it's up to you figure out how the laundry service works, and where it is, and the how the do not disturb/room service switches work. The building also has a bad layout with the laundry rooms, service stations etc all spread throughout the building instead of being on one floor so that nobody gets a quiet room. The right of the building faces a mosque too which means they get blasted with the call to prayer. Feels like a lot of aspects of this hotel weren't properly thought out. Another example of poor planning is the pool barrier, rather than having a 6 foot galvanized fence so that you can see the mini junlge behind the hotel, they have a waist height vinyl wrapped glass railing.",

Good location—within walking distance to the cable car if you’re planning to visit Sentosa and near the MRT. The room was quiet.",
