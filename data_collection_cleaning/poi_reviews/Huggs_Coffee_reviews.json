Service from the two ladies were friendly and my drink was ready in less than 5 minutes. Nice area to sit and people watch. Seems like a popular spot for those cbd people to grab a quick cup of coffee too. No complains.",

      "text": "One of my fav coffee spots in SG. Reasonably priced drinks, nice vibe and I appreciate that the oat options are front and centre. Their coffee is great but what is unique is their tea and masala tea - both with oat milk options! Sooo delicious\n\nThey have clearly marked their dairy free options and their food items also have allergens written on them which is uncommon in SG. Not a massive vegan selection for food but there usually is 1 wrap at least thatâ€™s vegan friendly. Only complaint is that sometimes they use plastic cups for cold drinks even when dining in. Would be good to use glass where possible #endsingleuseplastic. #veganfriendly",

The coffee is fresh, hot and delicious and the staff are very friendly (and remember us + our orders). I usually have their Americano where my colleagues have their Kopi. Lately I have been eating their turkey ham and cheese wrap and I am addicted. If you are in the Tanjong Pagar area come and try them out, you won't regret it!!",
