N. Gan,5,"Just found a hidden gem‚ÄîCluny Court‚Äîand it seriously felt like I was overseas for a moment. It‚Äôs right next to Botanic Gardens MRT, but the vibe is so different from the usual city spots. The place has this old-school charm with colonial-style architecture and a really chill, heritage feel.

There are cute little cafes, boutique stores, and lifestyle shops that make you want to slow down and just explore. Perfect spot for a quiet brunch or coffee, especially if you're heading to or from the Botanic Gardens. Definitely one of those places that makes you feel like you‚Äôve escaped the usual routine. I‚Äôll be back for sure.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111536004756755931697/reviews
Florence Leow,4,"üü° Cluny Court at Cluny Road is just across the road from Botanic Gardens MRT Station.

üü° This small retail mall is only 2 levels high, and is situated within a revamped row of colonial shophouses. It's located in a quiet upscale residential area and has a relaxing & nostalgic ambience.

üîµ The stores and dining options here are limited & are premium type of shops.

üü© The CS Fresh aka Cold Storage supermarket & dining outlets are usually the busier shops. ‚úÖÔ∏è There is Tiong Bahru Bakery, Da Paulo Cafe, Simply Bread, a Korean eatery, a hair salon, an ice cream store, pet shop and others.

‚ùáÔ∏è I do drop by Cluny Court from time to time to buy stuff from the supermarket and have a coffee and buy pre-prepared food from Da Paulo. I like the soothing ambience of this small mall on a weekday afternoon.

üü®It is kind of easy for me to access Cluny Court as I live in Toa Payoh and can visit this area via Caldecott Station to Botanic Gardens Station.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
Marissa Blancada,5,Its a small place but it has quite a few good shops for children and adults. There is fresh Cold storage supermarket at the ground floor and u can fine restaurants upstairs and downstairs if u prefer to just sit outside and watch the traffic pass. All in all its a decent place.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103590313125384508366/reviews
Qian LI,1,Bad service. The restaurant used the reused/filled two-side form for customers to fill for the selection of salad bar. It turns out that I couldn‚Äôt be able to enjoy the soup that I wanted but some selection that others filled. Bad service and destroy my mood for the entire morning!,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105267770850717576583/reviews
Vee Kwok,4,"They got Christmas fair now, so festive~ But the corridors and lobby a bit narrow and small. Like the old building, esp corners and ground floor that don't have the crowd inside... Plenty of small shops and restaurants, will give a try next time~",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112685768201094418038/reviews
