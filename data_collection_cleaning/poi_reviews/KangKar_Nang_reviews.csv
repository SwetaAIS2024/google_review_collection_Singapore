Aravindhan Ravikumar,5,"On 12 July 2024 (Friday), I had seafood fried rice for my lunch at Farm House food court at Dairy Farm Mall after taking Tower Transit Singapore MAN ND323F Euro V Batch 1 (SMB5902A) on service 966 from the bus stop opposite Trellis Towers along the PIE to the bus stop outside Dairy Farm Mall along Petir Road and the seafood fried rice tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would look forward to having some delightful seafood fried rice dishes from other stalls in food courts and hawker centres in the future.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106935057144500350420/reviews
