Nancy Koh,5,Wholesome yummy dinners. . We loved all the soups and the big portions. Erica is not stingy in her food and is receptive to feedback. Highly recommended if you want home cooked food. Wednesdays are western dinners and Fridays dinners come with desserts. We can see and feel that she takes pride in her preparation of food.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103814664979442525680/reviews
Wilfred Wong,5,"Ate their food first at a Christmas party where the catered food was by Fat Queen Cooks. Food was great. Food was individually portioned, so the consumer just picks up and eat. There were leftovers after the party, so I know Fat Queen Cooks does not scrimp on the serving sizes. Taste-wise, it was good too. Salmon was not undercooked, pasta was not dry and clumpy together. Impressed by the food quality as it is above what normal buffet food is like.

I ordered my own catering through Fat Queen Cooks after eating their food. So far so good, will have to see their timely delivery to have a complete picture.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105540262042796029422/reviews
Noni Lai,5,I am delighted to share that I have made the right decision to order my family Christmas lunch from @Fat Queen Cooks/  Erica you're brilliant in putting together an amazing feat of traditional Christmas FOod!! Having spent 14 years savouring and celebrating Christmases in London UK 🇬🇧 I feel it's brought back the nostalgia of Honey Roast Chicken /here it's  very moist and succulent and delicious at that with roast vegetables like Brussels sprouts and roast potatoes WOw!! Really scrumptious and just like how I roast it myself/  having family over with 4 grandkids over I didn't want to spend cooking instead it's a time saver and convenient to look for to my order delivery! The bacon skewers and duck canapés were awesome / so well matched for the festive mood/ especially the smoked Duck which  I particularly liked! There's lots more to the honey cranberry fizz so refreshing with nice fruit and sparkling drink!! KUDOS to your effort hard work and dedication @FatQueenCooks 5 stars .. THANK YOU SO MUCH 🧧🧧🎄🎯🙏🙌🏻🕊🎁🏡❄️🎊HAPPY 2025 from NONI LAI 💞,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114304254223273755527/reviews
Jia Qing Ng,5,"Chanced upon Fat Queen Cooks on my IG page while browsing for inspiration on what to buy for a Christmas gathering. Was a little apprehensive at first as I have never heard of them before but upon further looking up, saw that they have quite good reviews and decided to give them a try. During ordering, texted the owner to ask if I can swap the drinks from their preset menu for a dessert of similar price range and she obliged. Like her flexibility unlike some other businesses which do not allow any changes to their preset menu. Lastly, the food turned out to be good and my guests all enjoyed it. Look at the spread, the food was meant for 5 -6 ppl but they were generous in their quantity, certainly can feed more than that! Will recommend.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117389902170543527301/reviews
Poh Ai Gnoh,5,Have been enjoying Fat Queen Cooks tingkat and festive menu for some years now and feel that the quality and taste are so comforting and reminiscent of my childhood tastes.  I don’t know of any other caterer who does beef Wellington or even salmon Wellington!  Well done 👍 and keep the dishes coming!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107668443085930400108/reviews
