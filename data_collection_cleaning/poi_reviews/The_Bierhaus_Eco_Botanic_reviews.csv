King Tham,5,"I believe I will return to this place as we love the  Kilkenny beers, 5 stars to the steak yummy as it cooks to perfection Thanks to the chefs. The Pork however is too sweet maybe Its honey but then it pair with sweet sauce? ü§® I love the food here because the amount of vege they give and garlic with brocolli is Just perfect.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107613937577566084184/reviews
Ong NN,4,"Weekday lunch promotion 15.90, with free drinks (free flow mushroom soup, coffee, tea, ice lemon tea). With this price the food/ environment considered appropriate cp value. Burger taste good.

dolce bibobi,3,"Ribs was good, marinated very well and super flavourful. The schnitzel and fries was deep fried really well too which was nice.

Hated the mash potatoes though, could be the driest mash potatoes I‚Äôve ever had, it tasted like mashed cardboard üòÇ

Looking through the reviews, it seems like the lunch menu would be more attractive. Food was so-so for the price charged, 200RM for 3 dish + 3 drinks. Smoking was also an issue for us, nobody wants to inhale second-hand smoke üëç",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113755863430044252682/reviews
