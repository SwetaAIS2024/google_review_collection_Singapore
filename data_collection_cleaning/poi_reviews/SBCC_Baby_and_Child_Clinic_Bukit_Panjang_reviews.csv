Jenny Goh,3,"Staff were nice generally and the doctor explained in detail. However the waiting time is very long. Reached the clinic about 1020 and only got to see the doctor around 1130 despite being told there were only 4 people before me. After seeing the doctor, they said the doctor wanted to do a review. I asked how long it would take and the staff told me it would be quite fast. Waited almost 30 minutes (with my son screaming and crying as he was hungry and tired) but it was still not our turn for the review. In addition, the staff were not much help. everyone could hear my son screaming non stop and I asked twice how much longer it would take and they just said doctor hasnâ€™t called yet. Had to ask the staff to cancel because my son fell asleep.

Gaia Ong,5,"Good experience with the clinic. Dr Tan took time to explain the issues with my child's skin conditions and gave a clear diagnosis. Clinic staff were prompt and professional too. However, as there is long q at the clinic even before it open, there is a need to go very early.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116313784358918305475/reviews

Will give zero star if can.
2hour 45min for 5 patient.
Polyclicnc also doing better .

How can a private clinic where i pay $100 over per visit be so terrible

they do not allow u to do phone booking so u cannot wait at home.
Imagine bring a sick baby here and have to hang around outside for 2hours.

Jeanette Ong,5,"We had an excellent experience with Dr. Tan. He was incredibly patient and took the time to thoroughly explain my child's symptoms. His clear and detailed explanations helped us understand the diagnosis and the prescribed medication. Additionally, the nursing staff, especially the Indian nurse whose name I did not get, she was very patient and friendly which made the entire visit even more pleasant. Highly recommend Dr. Tan and his team!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102679617714546294805/reviews
