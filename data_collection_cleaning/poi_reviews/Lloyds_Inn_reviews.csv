Nishinoya Yu,5,"Room was very spacious and nature looking, which made me happy as a nature lover! Bathtub was big and tall, so the water level was alot higher than other hotels I've stayed at, making my stay even more enjoyable! Bath area was outdoor so it was a good new experience! Staff are friendly and welcoming too! Definitely highly recommended to stay here!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112133231408660030158/reviews
Gia Mẫn,5,"Vibe and decor, cleanliness very comfortable beds and all the staff was helpful, nice and accommodating, served by Annie. Very close to Somerset metro station and to Orchard Road Street. Access to multiple tourist places or local restaurant/market is very easy. The included breakfast at the nearest coffee was delicious. Definitely will come back again",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115206234750837656256/reviews
Adventure Of A Lifetime,4,"### **A Minimalist & Serene Stay at Lloyd’s Inn Singapore – Great for Business Travelers**

I stayed at **Lloyd’s Inn Singapore** during a **business trip**, and overall, it was a **comfortable and peaceful experience**. This boutique hotel is perfect for those who appreciate **a minimalist design, a quiet atmosphere, and a location close to shopping and dining options**.

#### **The Stay – Clean, Calm & Well-Located 🏨**
The hotel’s **aesthetic is simple yet elegant**, with a nature-inspired, modern feel. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully designed for relaxation. **It’s an excellent choice for business travelers** or those looking for a peaceful retreat away from the city's hustle.

One of the major advantages of Lloyd’s Inn is its **location**—just a short walk from **Orchard Road**, making it convenient for shopping, business meetings, and dining.

#### **A Few Downsides 🚪**
- **Limited View from the Rooms** 🏙️ – While the rooms have windows, the view is mostly **a blank wall** rather than the cityscape or greenery, which might feel a little confined for some guests.
- **No In-House Restaurant** 🍽️ – The hotel does not provide its own breakfast, but they offer **vouchers for two nearby restaurants (500-700m away)**. This worked fine for me, but it may not be ideal for those who prefer a more convenient dining option.

#### **Breakfast Experience – Two Different Styles 🍳**
Lloyd’s Inn offers two choices for breakfast, each at a partner restaurant nearby:
1. **Asian Breakfast** – A great option for those who enjoy **local flavors**, offering a variety of rice and noodle dishes.
2. **German Breakfast** – A **Western-style** breakfast with a good selection of bread, eggs, and sausages. This was my preferred option as it was a bit more filling and balanced. **(Good experience at both locations!)**

#### **Service & Facilities ⚙️**
The staff was **friendly and accommodating**, and I would rate the service **4/5**. However, I did encounter **a technical issue with the room lights** not turning on/off properly for two days. After informing the front desk, they **promptly assisted me and arranged a room change**, which was appreciated.

#### **Local Guide Pro Tips 🔥**
✔ **Great for business travelers or those seeking a quiet, minimalist retreat.**
✔ **If breakfast convenience is a priority, be prepared to walk to partner restaurants.**
✔ **Expect a peaceful, noise-free stay—but don’t expect a city view from your window.**
✔ **If you experience any room issues, report them right away—staff is responsive!**

#### **Final Verdict**
Despite a few minor inconveniences, **I would stay here again** for its **clean, quiet ambiance and great location** near Orchard Road. It’s a solid choice for business travelers and couples who appreciate **a peaceful, minimalist environment**.

Syazwan JD,5,"A great place to stay if you ever need a staycay or a vacay away from noise. Rooms were clean and looked beautiful. Service staff were friendly and detail-oriented. Overall, a great place to stay.

The only downside is - the location is a little bit out of the way into a quiet neighbourhood where you'd have to walk a decent amount from the nearest mrt station (Somerset).

Check it out!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108094778160860505696/reviews
