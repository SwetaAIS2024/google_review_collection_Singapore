      "text": "It's a small store inside a sports club and smaller than O'Coffee Club in Puteri. Upon entering, you will be given a disposable paper bracelet at the information counter. You can pay with your sports club membership card in the store. If you pay with cash, you can pay at the information desk when you leave. It seems like the menu is smaller than other stores, but it's good for a quick meal because there aren't many people. The overall menu is decent and delicious, and the staff is friendly.",
