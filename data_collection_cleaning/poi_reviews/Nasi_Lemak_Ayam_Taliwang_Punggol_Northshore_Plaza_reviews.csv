Zalina Ismael,5,"First time trying their Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang. Rice was fragrant, chicken was soft with parts nicely charred. The winner is the sambal Taliwang. At S$8, it's one of the pricier hawker fare but will definitely order again for the taste and quality.
Also, the staff were super nice and friendly.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103980962520691441562/reviews

Jenson Huang,1,"Terrible service from the lady at the counter. Wanted to order 20 pieces of prawn Otah at 11am in the morning but was told only left 10 pieces. Saw her taking big packets of frozen Otah and throw it on the floor when packing. Definitely have stocks but she is just lazy to sell it.

After bringing home the Otah, realise all the Otah are undercooked. See pictures.

Recommend to avoid at all cost to avoid food poisoning.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117424760193075011595/reviews
L ZF,1,"Donâ€™t like no. 1 (with chilli on top)

Liked chicken rice set (with bergedi). Rice is fluffy, bergedi is crispy and abit too oily but awesome.

Update: changed 5 stars to 1 star, their food standard massively dropped. Chicken batter completely changed to not sure eating batter or chicken. No standard. Even the worst kfc is nicer",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111633465861393492865/reviews
Catpura,5,"Can't go wrong with taliwang. Some days the counter staff were friendly, some days are not. Sambal Ijo is nice and the rice is fragrant. Wish that the chicken portion is a little bit bigger.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116561415671907910712/reviews
