      "text": "We came here after seeing some social media hype about its opening, especially since its previous outlet, which lasted for 21 years, had closed down. We travelled all the way here to try their famous chicken and waffles, and I learned that Waffletown is a franchise from the USA. Having a franchise here is an interesting experience since the whole area screams nostalgia and retro dining vibes with its display items, chairs, and classic menu. Feels like stepping into the early 2000s.\n\nHeres what we ordered:\n----\nüçó 3-Piece Chicken Set Value Meal:\nThis meal consists of coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and a medium drink. The coleslaw was quite typical, as was the mash. However, the chicken was incredibly well-marinated, crispy, and juicy, with the fat nicely retained, making it tender. The skin was exceptionally crispy as well.\nRating: ‚≠ê 4/5\n\nüßá Fried Chicken with Belgian Waffles\nThis dish featured a rectangular, slightly golden-brown waffle topped with chopped, boneless chicken cutlets. It also came with a side of maple syrup and butter. However, I found the waffle rather dry and soggy instead of having a nice crisp. The chicken, on the other hand, was really crispy and flavourful‚Äîthe batter gave it a good crunch. The drizzle of maple syrup tied the diner-style flavours of chicken and waffles together well. It had a homey, nostalgic old-school diner taste.\nRating: ‚≠ê 3.8/5\n\nü•≠ Fruit Salad\nThis was a simple mix of canned cocktail fruits in syrup, drained and topped with lots of mayo. It‚Äôs definitely not a high-fiber, healthy salad, but it brings back nostalgic flavours in a sugary, indulgent way.\nRating: 3.5/5 üåü",

Chicken was crispy and tender. Not oily. Perfectly fried to my liking. The waffle was light and crisp. There‚Äôs butter and maple flavoured syrup to compliment it",

The presentation wasn‚Äôt the best by today‚Äôs standard, but I really enjoyed the fried chicken, which was juicy and not greasy. The coleslaw was of chunkier cut of cabbage than I was used to (with small carrot bits), but overall still nice. Mashed potato was tasty, despite the pale look. Would definitely come back to try other things on their menu.",

The mashed potatoes were probably those powdered ones. The fried chicken was very skinny although it was quite delicious, especially the crispy skin and succulent meat.",
