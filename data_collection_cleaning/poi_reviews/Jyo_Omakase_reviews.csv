AQ Liew,5,"Very enjoyable omakase in a heartland area. Went on a Sunday night and it wasn’t too crowded. The food is very good and the service was excellent. Every fish item served is accompanied with a well-written explanation of what the fish is - usually the chef just verbally explains it and I can’t hear anything haha.

Felt right at home here and would definitely come back.

Can park at the stadium opposite. Plenty of lots there!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109045068293613328093/reviews

wp l,5,"Really true omakase experience. All the dishes are fantastic. They use fresh ingredients and know how to match different ingredients to balance the taste and texture. The plating skill is so good and looks too pretty to be eaten. The lady chef is knowledgeable on the different types of fishes, their taste, and texture. This is the first time when I had omakse, I know how the fish looked like as the restaurants had prepared picture cards of the fish. My friends and I had a great time enjoying our dinner at this little cosy place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112593298270774576897/reviews
Chin Seng Lim,4,"Loved every dish that came out of the kitchen and the hospitality. The truffle oil could be a bit less on the dishes as it comes out pretty strong, there could be more changes to the standard items on the menu but I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The best has to be the scallop sushi, really creamy topping with sweet scallops and umani explosion while savouring the taste, it was perfect. That was the perfect piece.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111281927314245931776/reviews
annabelle kim,5,"We went to try the omakase for birthday occasion.

They were very welcoming and friendly.

We chose the 238++ omakase dinner menu. There were many variety of food that we tried for the first time.

All the food tasted great. The chef explained all the dishes and even showed us the pictures of the fish to explain.

My favourite was the oyster dish, uni sushi! The mentaiko prawn was really good.

At the end of the dishes while eating dessert they even gave birthday cake and sing song with us.

Very pleasant experience and would recommend this place to others.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106347650631115855736/reviews
