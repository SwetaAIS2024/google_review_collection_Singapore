Val Lim,5,"A real hidden gem! I Cozy, little matcha spot run by the loveliest people. The flavours are super unique (think beyond the usual matcha latte). I had the earl grey matcha and it was bomb.com.  You can really tell how much care and precision goes into every cup. Service is warm, intimate and genuineâ€”it feels more like visiting a friendâ€™s kitchen than a business. Highly recommend if you love matcha, or just want something a little different.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106903802229479820401/reviews

Natasha Tai,5,The matcha gao is really gao!! And I'm so amazed that they're using a natural sweetener too that really complements the umami of the matcha flavour.. It's a takeaway spot so be prepared to grab n go !,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101114684850678463772/reviews
min,5,"New matcha spot in Outram! Tried the unique thai milk tea matcha latte, and it didnâ€™t disappoint (was surprisingly a nice combi)ðŸ˜‹ If you like cinnamon, can go for the honey cinnamon matcha latte which is slightly sweeter but itâ€™s a nice blend without overpowering the matcha flavor!

Definitely worth a try if you are nearby the area, wish I stayed closer ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜†",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109887064956231059694/reviews
qing an Liang,5,I had a cup of normal ice matcha latte. It was brilliantly blend and the proportion of matcha and other ingredients is perfect. It doesnâ€™t taste too strong and really smooth to drink it. I personally spoke to the owner. Sheâ€™s been doing this for a decade. Strongly recommend to go and try to believe it:),in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114193805510594362803/reviews
