      "text": "Charged $150 for translation when it was only $95 when done through the law firm. If it is $20-$30 more I can accept, but $55 is a huge difference. I even turned down a free courier service from them and spent more to take a taxi down for collection. I was accused of complaining after accepting the price. The fact is that I had done it before with them thru the law firm and I trusted them, so I did not think I needed to double confirm and compare with the previous charges. Disappointed with their reply.",
