Muddy Xr,5,"The satay packs a punch of flavor.  From the moment you take a bite, the spices tell the whole story.  The blend of turmeric, coriander, cumin, and lemongrass in the marinade creates a perfect balance of warmth, earthiness, and a subtle zing, while the hint of sweetness brings a rich depth to each skewer.  Grilled to perfection, the meat takes on a smoky, charred finish that complements the spices beautifully.  If you enjoy satay with bold, aromatic profiles, it is a must-try.  The spices truly say it all, elevating this dish to something unforgettable.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111716342422659081943/reviews
Rachel Chong,5,"Best satay in sg in my opinion. Each stick is so juicy, tender, well marinated and best of all big chunks of meat! Other places satay are all small and miserable meat. However will need to wait at least 1 hour as It's really popular.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107085517034927539587/reviews
