The food was average overall — the lamb cutlet was decent, but the fries that came with it were unfortunately soggy and lacked the crispness you'd expect.\n\nOn a brighter note, the salad bar promotion was definitely worth it. The variety was good, and it offered a refreshing balance to the heavier main dishes. It’s a great deal if you're looking for something lighter or enjoy multiple rounds of fresh greens and sides.\n\nThe highlight of the experience was the service. Hairul, in particular, stood out with his excellent service. He was attentive, friendly, and made sure we were well-informed about the ongoing promotions and menu items. His warm hospitality really made a difference and elevated the overall dining experience.\n\nOverall, while the food could use some improvement, the service and the value of the salad bar promo made the visit worthwhile."", 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': ""I recently dined here and had a mixed experience.

Just choose your favourite flavour and you are good to go for the side dishes.\n\nSide dishes are rather extensive and they are still warm, which is always good. The staffs are quick to refill the salad bar.\n\nPersonally i like mash potato the most.
