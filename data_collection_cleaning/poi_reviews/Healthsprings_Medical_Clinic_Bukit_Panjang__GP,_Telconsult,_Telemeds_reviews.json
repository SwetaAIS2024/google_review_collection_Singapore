Definitely the place to come to if sick but hopefully don't need to come in the first place! ðŸ˜…",

      "text": "Ydy was my 2nd visit to the clinic. I was utterly disappointed by the staff attitude. Especially with the long hair lady who took my blood pressure. On both occasions she presented no interest in her work. She behaved like an automated machine, no smile, no passion, no warmth, ALWAYS SOOOO MOOOODY.  When collecting the medications, there was no dosing spoon for liquid medicine until I asked for it, the nurse simply passed me a cup & didn't bother to explain the spoon wasn't  available, hence, replaced with a cup. What's wrong with the clinic staff? The team does not have any basic customer service,  they are just not the right fit for the job! Today I am sharing my experiences because I do not see any improvement from my last visit.\nHope something can be done before it is too late.",

It was as if she had no regard for basic courtesy. She would really benefit from some customer service trainingâ€”perhaps SkillsFuture credit could be put to good use here.\n\nThe only reason I brought my mother to this clinic was that her usual GP was unavailable all week. While the doctors themselves were lovely, the poor first impression left by the reception made the visit unpleasant. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this clinic based on our experience.",

You dont know how customer service works ah? As someone working in customer service myself ,her attitude is extremely unacceptable.Not professional at all.Ask her go for classes to improve on her horrible attitude.Thatâ€™s all.The girl with long hair.Such a simple job but giving attitude.Donâ€™t work and ruin others day.",
