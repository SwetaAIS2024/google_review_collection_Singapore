      "text": "An indoor ride (?) with some surprises in store. Like most 4D movie rides, first the audience are  briefed standing in the waiting hall on the backdrop. In this case it's set between Shrek and Shrek 2.\n\nThen into the main theatre where the audience gets to choose motorised seats (ride) or not (no ride).\n\nThe movie is good fun, well, anytime when the donkey is involved it's always fun. The motorised seats add some bumps to the road. The extra dimension is provided from nozzles on the top of the seats with smell (nice) and water spray (you disgusting Shrek!).\n\nA good family fun experience.",

You have to wear 3d glasses which are provided while watching the film to get the effect of things coming out of the screen. There is a seating area for people who don't want moving seats. The queue for here was the shortest in the park while we was there.",
