They serve super above average food for that cost too by the way, highly recommend!\n\nPlace is wheelchair accessible too from the L2 carpark via lift, suitable table height allows wheelchair users to dine in too.",

      "text": "Here I'm only referring to the PENANG KWAY TEO KIA stall in this coffee shop.\nThis food is quite amazing, it is essentially a slice fish soup stall with lots of pork minced meat variations.\nThe cook is very attentive and fast and generous with his serving of garnishes.\nI ordered the Mee Pok with only the fish ball and fried fish sticks. My partner ordered the teo chew fish porridge soup. Both are very tasty and full of aroma. I think (not sure) they put garlic bits into their soup, or salted fish, or both?\nThe mee pok is tangy and the noodles is springy enough but not \"al dente\" like some of the best I've tasted before. The fish porridege has luscious serving of fish slices and tomato and vegetables. The mee pok and the soup that comes with it, gets a 5 star from me. The rest, well they can improve.\nThe fish balls were fishy enough and has an acceptable tautness to it, but it far lacks the stall in Newton Circus, which I've reviewed. That's one of the best, perhaps in singapore.\ni would not hesitate going there to eat the next time I pass by that place. You should defintely give it a try, they have a good range. And most of all, the soups are full of flavour!",

Their poor experience was valid and they have every right to be angry. And I have noted the review and I won't eat at that particular restaurant anymore. But I have enjoyed quick meals at other businesses in this food court and I whole heartedly support their businesses.",
