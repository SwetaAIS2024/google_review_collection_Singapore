      "text": "A popular fast food spot, Arnold‚Äôs Fried Chicken at Pandan Gardens has a casual, no-frills dining environment. It can get busy, but service is relatively quick.\n\nThe fried chicken and fries were decent, though I still prefer KFC‚Äôs Original Recipe for its seasoning. The combo meals offer better value, but you‚Äôre still looking at around $10 per person.\n\nOverall, a solid choice for fried chicken lovers, but not necessarily a must-visit if you already have a favorite.",
