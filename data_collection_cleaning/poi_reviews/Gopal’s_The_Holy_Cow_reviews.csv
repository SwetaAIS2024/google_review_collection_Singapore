Cheshire CL,5,"This place is under the radar! Ordered takeaway - pizza, North Indian set meal, mushroom soup and prata. Food is delicious but the mushroom soup is slightly peppery.

Another patron recommended the kambing soup and briyani, will definitely try it for my next visit",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103275228752404656018/reviews
Han,5,"Amazing dining experience.

Prata was nicely done with soft and crispy parts matched with savoury curry sauce.

Baked cheese rice was tasty with plenty of cheese pull.

Definitely coming back to try out other items, they have a huge variety!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111918661715853417670/reviews
Mindstalk,5,"For someone who usually does not like vegetarian food, this place comes as a pleasant surprise when I brought my vegetarian mum here. Humbly located at the corner of an industrial estate (but visible and easily accessible to the public transport from just outside the road), this place serves a huge variety of food items. Other than the regular Northern (paneer, poori, Chapatti) and Southern Indian food (briyani, prata, dosai, mutarbak), it also serves western food (burger, pasta, pizza) and local food (char kway teow, fried bee hoon, nasi lemak, etc). The kids love the cheese burger and fries. Salad is refreshing!

Will certainly come back again to try the pasta and pizza and many more other items on the menu, which I failed to share here.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108368808394018433906/reviews
