Ravinder Singh,4,Love the chicken rice here. Rice is full grained & the roast chicken is just good. Best part is the chilli sauce. It packs the punch. It's a must do for me every time I fly in our out of T4 Changi. Quality has been consistent throughout the years.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102719535661291383683/reviews

Yang,3,"This Roasted Chicken Rice ($5.50) features tender roasted chicken, fluffy rice cooked in chicken oil, crunchy mustard greens, and cucumber slices, with a side of clear chicken soup. The rice has a soft, fragrant texture enhanced by soy sauce, and the roasted chicken thigh offers a plump, bouncy texture with a distinct roasted flavour. The chilli sauce adds a spicy kick, but the absence of ginger sauce and dark soy was disappointing. While satisfying, it's slightly pricey due to the airport location. Overall, a decent but standard plate of chicken rice that might be more affordable and flavourful elsewhere.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews
Alexandros Basarmidis,1,We are in 2024 for crying out loud!!! This is so bad it looks uncooked to me and I’m not going to risk eating chicken like this.. especially when I’m so far away. Be careful! In my humble opinion it looks uncooked!!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114155315977780487941/reviews
