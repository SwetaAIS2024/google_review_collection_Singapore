Jimmy Liaw,4,"We first used Maurice Lee & Tan (ML&T) to certify our application for the Lasting Power of Attorney.

Subsequently we used the services of ML&T to prepare our Wills.

We found the services of ML&T to be very satisfactory. Maurice & Ms Tan were very patient with our questions & queries which enabled us to conclude our LPA & Wills preparation in a short period of time.

Tay PJ,4,"I needed to engage a law firm to advise me on how to ring fence my assets for my legacy planning. This law firm helped me to identify all the pressing issues on a macro level and then zoomed to set up set my Will, Trust and LPA. I chose this law firm after some searches because they don't claim to be jacks of all trades. They are focused on a few practice areas and they did it well. They are easy to contact and responsive to my queries. It has been a pleasant experience. I like their professional approach and methodology in problem solving. They are customer centric. Now that  I have addressed my Will, Trust and LPA, I feel at peace knowing come what may (Covid19 or otherwise), I know that my legacy planning is intact.
