Joony Lee,3,"The Sashimi quality is just average, but rest of dishes are not fresh enough and softened texture already.
Staffs were watching TV and talking each other. No pay attention to customer.
It is very simple and nothing special interior but price point is not cheap at all. 2pax with Wooruk sashimi (우럭) costs us RM600 with 2 soju and 1 beer.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101030882035724072167/reviews

Leon Yyes,1,"Im not one to bash or bad mouth about a restaurant but i seriously need to tell d public about this restaurant. I have been to korean seafood restaurants in kl as i am originally from kl but i am shocked with d prices of this restaurant and to put d cherry on too d service  was so bad. Waiters was non existent Nd i had to get up and ask d owner to even open my beer.  The food prices was crazy about rm300-400 for a miserable fish stew. My husband and i ordered a single sashimi platter which came about 9-12 pieces of raw fish Nd that cost about rm110.  My husband ordered stir fried octopus dish and honestly going to some chinese seafood restaurant tasted better and cheaper becoz it was so chewy and we instantly kniw its frozen product.  D only small positive side is maybe d side dishes is ok but we have a feeling its store bought (anyway i’ve been traveling to korea since 2000 so i know what i’ve been tasting). D onwner only been layan-ing its korean friends while ignoring us as customers.  We had to look around for its workers becoz he just dump d beer at our table without even bother opening our beer. If its mamak price then u can say what u expect. But d seafood dish which was d restaurant specialty was so expensive and what we receive is so mediocre, u can at u understand for  us to be somewhat upset. Anyway this our experience and hope they improve, and i feel we need to let others be aware. Approach this place with caution this place as i feel  it will be a total waste of ur money and time. Some upscale japanese restaurant in jb is so much worth it and their service is excellent. Im so disappointed in this establishment becoz i was so craving  for korean shashimi style and this is d worse i have ever encountered.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115625883477082624589/reviews
