AMIT YADAV,2,"Today I dined at the restaurant and ordered the Fish Head curry from the Chef Recommended section. While the menu showcased a tantalizing photo of the dish, I received a mixed vegetable curry instead, which was not what I anticipated. The taste of the dish was unfortunately below average.

Additionally, the presentation of the meal left much to be desired. It was served in a clay pot without any cutlery provided initially. When I requested cutlery, I was given a broken plate with a significant piece missing/chipped-off. Upon asking for a replacement, I received an old plastic bowl full of stains. I persevered and eventually received a proper plate, albeit slightly wet, which I cleaned with a tissue.

When I scooped into the pot, the dish lacked the fish head. This oversight was disappointing, considering the anticipation I had from the menu description and looks

Moreover, I couldn't help but notice the apparent lack of attention to single diners. Despite the presence of many empty tables during my visit around 2 PM, the cashier's behavior towards me felt indifferent and, at times, rude.

Nevertheless, I remained courteous throughout my interaction, expressing gratitude for the meal despite the challenges encountered. Cashier's behaviour was curt, loud and blunt, as if he is telling me “you aren’t welcome here” kind of vibes.

In summary, while the food may have fallen short of expectations and the service left something to be desired, I hope this feedback can contribute to improvements.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103585526275153516117/reviews
CM T,4,"Was very confused by the name on Google maps. When I walked to the place I realised I've been there before years ago and it was definitely not called forest dew restaurant, but zi zai vegetarian.

I remembered the food was a little pricey (prices are nett, no service charge) but decent. The menu looks more polished now. They even indicated dishes that are spicy and with milk - though I heard they labelled the green curry wrongly (it's actually coconut milk, not dairy). Haha

Enjoyed the food today. It tasted better than I remembered it to be - the Tom yum fried rice was really tasty! The staff is friendly and nice. Will come back again if I'm in the area!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104969746559495007906/reviews
Zhao Kuang Tan,5,"Overshot my stop at Farrer Park and ended at Boon Keng. Took a quick Google search for vegetarian options nearby and found this store!

Went in just and it looks likes a bustling restaurant. Being socially awkward, I had eye contact with one of the counter staff, quickly pointed at a table nearby and did a gesture asking if I can sit there. Put down my bag, opened the menu and was promptly waited upon. Ordered Mee Goreng since I wanted something spicy and green apple juice to soothe that spice. The server was kind enough to explain that the medium portion usually serves two people, but I’m hungry so I ended up  ordering it anyways.

I was wearing ear buds and totally in my own world, but felt the place was getting crowded. I was situated in a command position so the crowd wasn’t that stressful for me. Sadly, there was no green apple juice and I decided to get Teh O instead (since I barely slept last night and am going to exercise a bit later).

The drink was served quite promptly after and I really like the big portion (honestly the tea powder cost peanuts, but it’s still a nice gesture). Love the small spoon that came along with it so I can slowly slowly sip.

I noticed a single diner being asked to share a table with another diner at the corner in the meantime. I thought, “hey, it’s getting quite crowded, I wonder if that will happen to me too? I always like talking to new people.”

Lo and behold, it did. It ended up being a couple who were set directly in front of me. I was feeling awkward and lost my command position so I just awkwardly avert my gaze away and enjoy the music blasting in my ear buds. Nice to hear bits and pieces of their conversation though. It was then one of the server dropped by and told the couple it was 初一 (a day when many local Chinese ate vegetarian, esp ppl from this neighbourhood) that it dawned on me that this crowd was not normal.

I think the kitchen thought my food was supposed to be together with the couple so it came together with them fashionably late. Can’t blame the busy kitchen and the time it took the food to came gave me a lot more time to cope with my social anxiety. Still too anxious to engage in small talk to the couple and it would probably be weird to start out of nowhere. Then again, (not really). It’s indeed a missed opportunity to connect with new people.

Attached is the food I ordered. Liked it enough. Expected larger portions since the server mentioned it’s usually meant for 2-3 people. I would say, looking at the choices from everyone else eating here, it’s on par with many Chinese vegetarian restaurants at this price range.

A place where you will have food you probably wouldn’t complain too much about, with friendly neighbourhood servers, and good dining atmosphere! I would really compliment the service I’ve gotten because the server was quite nice to me as a single diner who’s a bit stingy with money! For someone like me, food you enjoy will be worth the money, and the okay food will feel a bit pricey.

Definitely a good place to bring your friends to dine if there is a vegetarian among them and there are no other good options nearby!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110913137349849003337/reviews
