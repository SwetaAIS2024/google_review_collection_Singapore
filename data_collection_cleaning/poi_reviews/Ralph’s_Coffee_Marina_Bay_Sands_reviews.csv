Jane Tan,3,"Limited seating with only four tables, so it can fill up fast. Tables weren’t cleaned as quickly as expected, but staff did clean up promptly once I was seated, which I appreciated. Had a cup of hot chocolate—tasted fine, though a bit disappointed that marshmallows were no longer available.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104641161252356097285/reviews
Happy Bird,4,"Small little cafe with very very limited seating. Coffee was not the greatest, quite acidic actually. The cafe looks nicely designed though, befitting the Polo Ralph Lauren image and branding. They just need better coffee that's all. Or maybe better Baristas?",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108716533290322327726/reviews
You K,2,"As a café under the globally recognized Ralph Lauren brand,
decided to visit early in the morning.
Located on the first floor of Marina Bay Sands, the entrance is marked by a large, not-so-plump teddy bear that warmly greets customers.
The interior is chic and elegant, featuring a clean white and green color scheme that exudes sophistication.

Since it was still early, the place was completely empty except for us, allowing us to choose our seats comfortably. However, despite the quiet atmosphere, the staff were completely unresponsive, even when we tried to get their attention, which quickly left us feeling frustrated and unwelcome.

That said, the coffee was excellent—rich in aroma and taste, far superior to what you’d find at certain well-known chain cafés.
The delightful coffee alone makes me want to return, but next time, I might consider trying a different location to see if the service is better elsewhere.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114290941081043664370/reviews
Posh Pearl,5,"A quaint and gorgeous little cafe. Really love the aesthetics. I was glad that there were seats available as it was past dinner time.
The matcha latte was decadent without being sweet.
Would love to visit again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106728704755913363642/reviews
DaX Toh,5,"Very yummy chocolate chip cookie! A must try! They only have a few tables available so be prepared to wait during peak periods. Staff service is great, very attentive! They even offered us a small complimentary cup of ice cream while we were waiting for a table. Decor is nice, and signature Ralph Lauren. Would go back again, just for the chocolate chip cookie!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110795556109846185546/reviews
