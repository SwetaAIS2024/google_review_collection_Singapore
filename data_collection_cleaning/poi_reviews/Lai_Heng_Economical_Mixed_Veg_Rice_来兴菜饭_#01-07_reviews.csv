YY,3,"Came across this famous economical rice and decided to give it a try - and as it‚Äôs name suggests, it‚Äôs really economical!

üí∞ definitely bang for your buck, 1 egg 1 vegetable 1 potato and 1 meat (without rice) for just $2.70

The food was however a little cold when I got it at 11am - perhaps the lunch rotation hasn‚Äôt come about. But I‚Äôm picky on temperature of the food so I can‚Äôt give it more than 3.

Probably will return during lunch crowd in future if I‚Äôm up for it again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
