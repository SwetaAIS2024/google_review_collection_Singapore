Audrey Tan,5,"Have eaten here a couple times and food is consistently good. Good value as well. Didn't take many pics because dived straight into the meal. Beer horfun is good. Fish horfun is alright. Crab meat tofu is good. 排骨王 is good. Harcheongkai is good. Crab is good. Sambal sweet potato leaf is good.

Sitting at the back al fresco style is nice and chill, especially with the community garden next to you.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100537510928931715089/reviews
Pardy Shu,1,First and last time here. Found the tze char stall and decided to try the beef fried rice. Ordered for dine in and waited for 25 mins before I went to ask and realised it was put for takeaway. No one informed me that the food was ready even though the person who took the order heard wrongly. Disappointed with the service they gave for newcomers. Food was not at a standard where such treatment was justified. Try at your own risk if you are new to this place 😖,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115290734350273523943/reviews

Jay G,2,"We had the fish head steamboat and prawn omelette. The fish head steamboat wasn’t great; the soup had a burnt taste. The staff mentioned it might have been caused by the frying of the fish (sorry to say, but any steamboat soup would taste better than this). However, the teh bing siew dai was good!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104257987738911711467/reviews
