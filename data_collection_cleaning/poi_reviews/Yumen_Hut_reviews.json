After we ordered, she shared with me a mix of Google reviews - some good some bad with only 2.7* for over hundreds, some praising for it's economic pricing vs rest of other restaurants here in Downtown E!.\n\nI have given a 3* because to be fair, the rating varies from individual to individual some prefers tasty or heavier seasoning while some prefers lighter.\n\nTheir seafood Yi mee - 6.5/10, with some  decent taste but prawn bit small\nOtah - 8/10 must try\nSpinach mee dumpling - 2/10, completely off expectation I think they should indicate seasoning or flavouring rating to manage patrons expectation\nCurry chicken noodle - 5/10, spicy yet not enough curry flavor\n\nI may return just for it's otah for Dabao let my parents try.",
