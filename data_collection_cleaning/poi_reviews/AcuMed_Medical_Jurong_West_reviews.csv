Wong Xin Kit,1,"I have visited there on 26/4 for a work pass renewal medical checks. The staff said will send me email once the report is done. Until 5/5, I called them 4 times and unable to reach them. No choice I have to go to the clinic to collect my report. When I see my report, actually it has been completed on 28/4 but they never inform me! It really waste my time on waiting reply. Next time just straight away collect report after two days.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100122612641776470565/reviews
Keng Yen,1,"I visited the clinic this morning and saw an elderly male doctor. He only prescribed painkillers and referred me to departments that seem unrelated to the actual root cause of my issue.

I even told the lady at the counter that I was experiencing a serious headache, and her advice was to just continue queueing for another hour. I endured intense pain for that entire hour, got nothing resolved, and still had to pay for it. Can you imagine?

I ended up visiting another clinic later that day, and only then did I receive a proper assessment and treatment.

This experience not only delayed my recovery but also caused unnecessary stress and discomfort. I hope this feedback prompts a review of the clinic‚Äôs triage and consultation process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I genuinely hope future patients receive more timely and appropriate care.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104111070872111170285/reviews
Han Thein,5,"This morning, on 19 April 2025, I went there for a follow-up eye check-up.

The queue number was processed very quickly, with a waiting time of just 10-15 minutes. There's been significant improvement.

Good work. I love very very much.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113964445923535391365/reviews

Nicole Koh,1,"Terribly chaotic in managing patients‚Äô queue and terrible customer service! Totally insensitive to patients‚Äô time!  Waited more than an hour for a simple employment medical examination that only included urine test, eye test, BP. Had to prompt the staff if my queue number had been missed. Only then they alerted the staff who was suppose to do the test. Queue number was flashed indicating a specific room but a patient was in there! Really chaotic!! Took forever to pay and still did not get the report despite the doctor saying that only the clinic chop was needed. Again had to prompt the staff before they told me that the medical report would be emailed! Only when I called on the 3rd day after then the staff said she will email me!!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116707813538484758389/reviews
