      "text": "If I can give a zero star I would. After my swim, I went to the left most side of the multi purpose room next to the brick wall and switched on the lights at that corner. Chatting with my friend in not more than 10minutes, the cafe uncle came and rudely interrupted us. He said in a harsh and unfriendly tone “who ask you to on the lights? I’m paying rent you know?”. Excuse me, but there is no sign saying not to switch on the lights at this corner as far as I know the cafe’s corner is next to the glass wall. How I know? Because the first time I patronised this space, the same uncle scolded me for using his table next to the glass and told me to move to the side of the wall. Today, 17/10/2023, 9:13pm, he is again at his rude behaviour. I told him I didn’t know that this area is part of his tenancy, there wasn’t any sign stating anything of what he claimed, and as far as I know the clubhouse is open till 10pm. So I told the uncle why not you put a sign so that would prevent such things from happening in the future. But he, again rudely dismissed me saying if you don’t want to listen then don’t la, gesturing as he said that. My goodness I have not met such a rude old person before. You would think that age makes a person mellow. I would suggest people to be careful for this man and his attitude. Nothing against the food just the person working here.",

      "text": "I have been living in Braddel for the last 5 years and the clubhouse area used to be for residents to use as a place to eat or socialise. Other condo I have visited also have such facilities for people to gather, whether it is for people to sit and chat, read a book, study their subject, throw a potluck or have a Mooncake Festival - the whole point is that such a space is multi-purpose. I share some of the views of the reviewers about the lack of service standard/poor attitude from the uncle of the shop. His behaviour is harsh and rude. The incident happened a few months back, I didn’t want to bother writing it here but I bumped into him again and I’m just surprised that the cafe management is not helping him improve his behaviour. Thinking that the multipurpose hall was what is it, and there wasn’t any no outside food sign anywhere or is there is line demarcating the cafe space from the public space and what more the tables were all different. My friend and I sat at a corner studying then the uncle came and said this is not for us to study and use his electricity (in a rude tone). I told him as the operator he should put up signs to tell people at least, have that courtesy and not just blast people with his unruly tone. He then defended himself by saying the condo manager should be the one putting up the signs. Effectively pushing the responsibility to someone else. If the tables belongs to the operator, then the operator should at least put sign stating their policy. It is what most cafes or eateries do- “no outside food”, “no using of tables without making any purchase from Jio Makan”, etc. there are many ways to prevent misunderstandings, so why leave potential customers this sour experience? Also, there weren’t many people on that day too maybe just 4 tables mostly occupied by students, it is not like we are hogging the place and disrupting their business. This uncle and the cafe operator couldn’t see the long term gain, that while we are studying we might get hungry or thirsty and people may patronise them. Totally short-sighted. So be warned if you visit this place, the uncle is very sensitive.",
