JC,5,"The smoothest chicken I had, and the consistency is always there. Been eating here for around 20 years, it’s the best steam(white) chicken rice in Ang Mo Kio.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105403312120201214630/reviews
Ron Ng,4,"Came by for early lunch and ordered their chicken rice with extra rice. Rice is fluffy and fragrant. Although breast meat was given, I had no complains because it was tender and juicy. Their versions of the chilli is slightly more sour and tangy which adds a nice taste along with the savoury rice. I must complement their soup defintely tasted rich.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102898821791109530498/reviews
Josh,5,"This place serves poached chickens (白鸡). Loved the chicken thigh rice. Breaking down into components, the rice was fluffy and well seasoned. The chicken thigh was tender, smooth, and definitely not oily. Soup was delicious.

Only downside is that this is a popular stall, so expect to queue. However you can understand why it's popular when u take the first bite.

They offer chicken rice in $4/5/6 options with a top up required for wing, thigh or drumstick.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109525553634627607435/reviews
Mei,5,"It is stall in 628 Ang Mo Kio Wet Market. They open quite early (I was there at 8am). The chicken rice fluffy and flavourful, the chicken juicy and soft.
Best of all is the price, it is affordable. What you see on my plate is $4.
Don’t forget to take the ginger and chili, it is nice condiment.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115812854112786325156/reviews
CT Low,5,"Number one chicken rice stall. I can't find another stall that can beat this yet. The chicken (all parts) is always cooked so soft and tender. Fragrance of the rice is unbeatable. Every mouthful of the meat for me must come with chilli, sweet sauce and ginger paste. It's sinful, but absolutely heavenly. Be prepared to queue for 20-30 minutes during peak hours. Be warned. Fortunately, this stall has not come into radar of the so many so called food gourmets or online food critics. I've no complaints about it, otherwise queue will even be longer :)",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116303222971074382808/reviews
