Nonoka O.,5,"Their pulut serunding ($2) was nice, sweeter than the ones I had in KL, but no less complex and well balanced. Super friendly locals around! I was recommended the chee cheong fun here by a friendly uncle. Will go try next time!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109719649398228214548/reviews
Marky815 YY,5,"Wide variety of Nyonya food fares.
The food quality is not fantastic, but the prices are wallet friendly. Fried bee hoon clears out fast, each patron buying 3 to 4 packets.
Do note it draws a long queue in the morning, so you can expect to wait about 10-15 minutes before being served.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108508544797279977547/reviews

Tan Kean Peng,5,"Get to know this place because the MP who is speaker of Singapore parliament always visited here for breakfast.

Purposely bought their kueh to try. In Bedok, you can find a few kueh manufacturers but here is the one that price cheap and nice taste.
