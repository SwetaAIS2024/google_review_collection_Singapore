lilian joy,5,"Quirky deco, fabulous atmosphere for a meetup with friends and the food is a real talking point. The laksa is the best I‚Äôve ever eaten, seriously! And the other dishes we tried were just sumptuous. The pictures of the food speak for themselves. Desserts were a delight. Near Buona Vista mrt and walkable from One North too. A real gem.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108262347766711402115/reviews
Daryl Dela Cruz,5,"Staff are extremely nice! Had a fun time with my friends here üòÅ

Location is a short walk from Buona Vista MRT and is quite conveniently located.

Food was nice. My friend got the baked rice which was flavourful and the portion size was generous. The drinks were quite good and cute! Desserts had the right amount of sweetness, and overall were new and interesting things that I haven‚Äôt tried before",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106947518254448536959/reviews
coolohoh,4,"Food is tastes great, friendly staff. Service is a bit slow and messy though, but hopefully that will get better with time and experience. Not that much sitting space, and until they get things nailed down I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this for lunch if you‚Äôre in a rush. Great if you want to chillax a bit, they have a selection of pretty looking desserts that you can get as a set for with a main.

Update: Very friendly staff, and they have definitely gotten things running more smoothly now. Food is great and amazing quality, definitely worth a visit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110345839087491194591/reviews
JasTS Chan,5,"Enjoyed lunch at this surreal cafe on 5 Mar 2024. Avocado laksa was delish - like vegie curry, lemak yet light. Made it a set meal ( a drink & salad) for $2 extra.  Enjoyed a surprise complimentary baked donut with lotus paste filling. Love the experience and will be back again soon. Muslim friendly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111144366674034551458/reviews
Kanika Jain Gandhi,3,Pumpkin mushroom soup is creamy and delicious. Honey garlic chicken is very dry. They basically gave chicken wings to eat with rice (too dry). Drinks are good and cute. A bit expensive for the portion size.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110936181395426419274/reviews
