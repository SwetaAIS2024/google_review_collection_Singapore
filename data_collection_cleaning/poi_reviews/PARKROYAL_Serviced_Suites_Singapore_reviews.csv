Samantha S,5,"I stayed here for 2 months at the start of the year. The service apartment is located in the heart of Singapore. The building might look old on the outside, but the rooms are nicely furnished.

What stood out for me was the excellent front desk and housekeeping team at Park Royal. They made me feel at home. Would definitely stay here again.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105863351446119466454/reviews
Aurika Imtiaz,5,"I stayed here for a month and had a delightful stay. The location is impeccable, a few minutes walk away from bustling Bugis, public transport services the area very well keeping it well connected and close to many eateries along Haji Lane.

However the service in this establishment is what really stood out for me. I was checked in by Oscar who was welcoming from the get go and super helpful with great insider knowledge of Singapore. The warmth and enthusiasm I received from the front of desk staff and the housekeeping staff was unbeatable and I would definitely come back to stay here again. Thank you guys again for making me feel so welcomed",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108313980664575761635/reviews
ThengKie Goh,1,"The rooms in this hotel are bigger than normal hotel rooms at around 450 sq ft.  Location is good (300m from Nana BTS station). However the fittings looked aged and things are starting to fall apart. Wifi is almost non existent (good luck to you if you are relying on hotel WiFi for business or communication). Hotel gym is poorly maintained. There is no water nor towel for guests to wipe down. I was there on 2 separate mornings and it was disgusting to find pools of sweat left by other guests before me around the treadmill.

I stayed there for 4 nights (4 to 8 Jul 2024). The first room (Room 1013) assigned to me has choked toilet. It almost overflowed when I flushed. Went down to ask for a change and was given another room (0911). On the last night, I felt something crawling over my face while sleeping. Woke up at 0230hrs and found a huge cockroach crawling on our bed. Spent some time catching the bug and end up not able to sleep the entire night.

We complained to the front desk the next morning and the only response we got was ""sorry"".

I flew back home and wrote a note to the hotel GM. You would have thought that they will response. But no..... this is service at is ""best"".

Never again will I stay in this hotel!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106349203865704881209/reviews
