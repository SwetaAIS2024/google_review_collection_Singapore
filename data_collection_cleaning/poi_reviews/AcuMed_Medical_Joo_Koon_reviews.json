Salute to a lady whoâ€™s doing so called a one man show in the clinic. She has to do the registration, the paperwork , sheâ€™s the one who did the test for us. Just WOWâ€¦ A very strong lady indeedâ€¦ still she can put on a beautiful smile during that busy time. A very dedicated lady she is. Thank you Mamâ€¦ I admire your dedication.ðŸ«¡",
