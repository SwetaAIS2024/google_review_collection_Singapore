She is a very kind and patient and will always provide helpful tips and ways to improve the way I am playing, even when teaching songs that she is not very familiar with. Her lessons are able to maintain my interest in playing the piano and I am very grateful for her teaching for the past 10 years.",

Probably the person outside of my family that I've spent the most amount of time with. She is kind and patient, while still allowing her teaching to be direct and effective. Lessons often result in evident improvement, and she is able to adapt to your improvements accordingly in each lesson. Overall, a fantastic piano teacher, both short-term and long-term, able to teach people of all ages and skill levels, and an amazing person all around. 5 stars. ",

She is a very dedicated, passionate and encouraging teacher who takes time to ensure that I learn well and understand the right way to play the piano. She guides me and prepares me well for my piano and theory exams. Even during the lockdown, she conducted lessons online and continued to find ways to ensure that I learn effectively so that learning is not disrupted. Throughout all these years, she continues to guide and motivate me. She is also very caring and patient and will take time to ask me how I’m doing. Every year, she gives me the opportunity to take part in a concert performance where I can invite my family to watch. I am grateful to have learnt so much from her and I really enjoy learning piano from her.",
