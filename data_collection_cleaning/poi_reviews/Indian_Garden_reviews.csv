Graham Usher,5,"Went to see the light spectacle and missed most of it which was a shame, make sure you are early and go on the path and bridge under the light trees to get the best experience.

We saw a bit and then went to the fountain show which is also well worth it and just on the other side.

Wear some really comfortable shoes, we walked about 28,000 steps this day!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106952929682581212760/reviews
