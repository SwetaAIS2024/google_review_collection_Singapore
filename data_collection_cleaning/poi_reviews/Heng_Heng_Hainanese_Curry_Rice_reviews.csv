Stanley Ling,5,I ordered delivery and ate so fast i forgot to take photos.  The braised pork curry rice which comes with fried cabbage looked underwhelming and perhaps on the dry side but the first mouthful was a delight.  The pork and the skin was wonderfully tender and flavourful.  The fat melted into the rice as I chewed and the curry gravy (just thick enough to coat without being too gloopy) added just enough spice to complement the pork.  Cabbage gave a slightly crunchy texture and a burst of sweetness.  I normally can't finish a single portion of pork belly curry rice but this one disappeared real fast.  Don't order if you are trying to manage your carbo intake.  Seriously delicious.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112836895331286543854/reviews
Wei xiong Wang,5,"Pork Belly Classic Âç§ËÇâÂ•óÈ§ê

üçú Food wise: Just look at the lovely colour of the curry filled rice! Already made one drool while writing this. The thick and flavourful taste of curry was slightly sinful but worth it!

The pork belly, woah, now look at the beautiful pork fat and meat, that delicious and succulent layering, those few pieces like not enough leh. More!

The fried egg was also another tasty one, the light, fluffy and crunchy eggs. Also not enough, so good!

The little hack here I suppose, they don't have chili to go with it. But the stall beside it, the one that sells wanton mee, they belong to the same boss. Take some of it and eat it with this curry rice! With the added kick of spice, even better taste!

‚ú® Ambience wise: Great! Nicely decorated food court!

ËõãÂç∑,1,"Went to get 2 plates of curry rice with my partner just now.
Server was a auntie who was extremely rude,
This is a stall that specialise in curry rice
Yet the server only scooped approximately one table spooon worth of curry for each of the plates we ordered. When requested for more curry gravy the server told us she can‚Äôt do so as there wouldn‚Äôt be enough curry for her other customers ü§®

Meat were cold and bland
Curry was too salty
Vegetables were cooked until too soft and mushy

Strongly do not recommend",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111181037012317394496/reviews
Dennis Huang,5,This curry rice is good. Thick curry sauce goes well with a mixture vegetables and fried pork culet. Other choices of dishes too if do not prepfer the standard set. Price reasonable,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110193182918374997866/reviews
Chee Yong Lim,1,"Unreasonable pricing!
Need to pay a la carte price if you do not order standard set and operator did not inform beforehand.
Set is $5.20 but need to pay $6.60 if you change one dish.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111658037626490509892/reviews
