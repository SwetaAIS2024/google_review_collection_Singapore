Sushiliah Devi,5,This Bendemeer Food Centre is always busy in the morning. People of all ages start early and go to this food centre for breakfast. Thereâ€™s a variety of food to choose from and you can enjoy different tastes from different stalls. Price is reasonable but the ambience can be hot as it is not air conditioned. I brought some of my American friends here for breakfast and they enjoyed our local food. Thumbs up to our Hawkers food. ðŸ˜‹,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109788552494394660918/reviews

Bethany Yeo,5,Not too crowded and was quite airy due to lots of big fans and higher ceiling. Tried the Hokkien mee by an older Chinese couple because I saw a queue and it was quite good! Very generous with the portion for $5 - 4 prawns that were sweet and flavourful.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118037755506780546881/reviews
