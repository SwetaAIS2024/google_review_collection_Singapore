      "text": "A well-maintained outlet that offers a clean and pleasant dining environment. What sets this location apart is the lovely view outside—whether you're seated by the windows or just taking in the surroundings, the scenery adds a relaxing touch to the overall experience.\n\nThe service here is reasonably fast and efficient, making it a convenient stop whether you're heading to Sentosa, shopping at HarbourFront Centre, or just passing through. The food lives up to KFC’s usual standards—crispy fried chicken, tasty sides, and refreshing drinks served hot and fresh.\n\nThe seating area is fairly spacious and usually not too crowded during non-peak hours, offering a comfortable spot to unwind. Overall, it’s a good choice for a casual meal with the added bonus of a scenic view.",

      "text": "the staff at the counter named TULSI was unwilling to serve me over the counter just because i wanted to use the trust card to get the $2 discount she insisted on me paying at the kiosk machine. After telling her i wanted the disocunt, she then ask me to wait for a good 5 minutes until she is willing to serve me to take my order. She talk to me and have a face as if i owe her a million dollars. her attitude is so bad and her service whats better ? please improve on ur customer service.\n\nAdditionally i bought cheese fries, look at the amt of fries and sauce i got. its worst than the other places i visited. i hope u will not be stingy with the portion especially with the price i paid this is what u geg is ridiculous",

Well organized party with complete different kinds of fried chicken, many tasty sauces, fries, my favorite coleslaw & mash potatoes, free flow drinks & 1 time 2 small cakes & egg tart. Constantly being asked if we need more chicken by the staff. I managed 2 chicken wings (preferred chicken part) & 1 big piece of chicken, chicken tenders, chicken nuggets, chicken popcorn & fries with nacho sauce. It was a fun experience at the feast.",
