It should be fine even if you wear spectacles, just need to be cautious.\n\nNearby 1 min walk is the Palawan toilet so itâ€™s easy to shower after the activity.\n\nThere were 4 lifeguards within the hydrodash. 1 or 2 were enthusiastic and engagingâ€¦ the others were like sloths just chilling by the beach!
