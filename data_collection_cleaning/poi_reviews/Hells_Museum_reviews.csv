Jack Newland,5,Great little eye opener and spot to walk around. Some very interesting displays and great history about this place. Doesn't take long to walk around so would recommend for a time filler at the least for sure,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109243395441073182305/reviews
Patrick L,5,"One of the strangest museums I've ever been too, but thoroughly enjoyed it. They've recently put a lot of work into refreshing the museum and it's paid off, really fun and interesting place to visit as long as you don't mind a bit of kitsch.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106058222914712992997/reviews
Rhianna Ramshaw,5,"This was a fantastic visit and made the whole of Haw Par Villa more enjoyable. The staff were kind and helpful. I took my time and read everything there, it took me a little under an hour. I think this is a must-do if you are visiting Singapore and want to know more about Taoist practices and beliefs. They have a little bit on other religions as well, but it mostly focuses on Taoism.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102141469964087698883/reviews
Marieke Burghoorn,5,"Unique premise, well executed. Loved the simple yet comprehensive introduction video and good descriptions throughout the museum. Definitely something Iâ€™ll remember at leaving Singapore :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108044906505660627511/reviews
Jeanz C,4,"Hmm.. one have to be open on how religions come about to visit this place otherwise, you may not benefit from this. Probably will not sit well with the overly religious people. But it's insightful on what happens after death especially on the punishment received depending on what bad thing one did. Good place to teach children (would say above 6) to do good, be filal, be respectful to elders etc.. if not there will be punishment in the afterlife. Figures are quite scary/gory for young kids. If one doesn't believe in the afterlife etc, please do not waste your time visiting this place.
There are mosquitos at the outdoor area, that is the reason for drop of one star. And the turtle pond/wishing well is not maintained with lots of surplus of food floating in the water.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117429113234575958596/reviews
