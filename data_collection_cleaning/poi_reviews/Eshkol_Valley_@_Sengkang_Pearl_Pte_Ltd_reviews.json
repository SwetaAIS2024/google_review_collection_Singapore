Everyone in the school is very friendly and helpful, especially Principal Jessica. She will go extra miles to help you if you have any enquiry. My son really enjoyed himself and learned really well. He can express himself pretty well now~",

      "text": "My son, who is in N2, had a fantastic time attending the preschool in Eshkol Valley and genuinely enjoyed his time there. The first time I visited the school, I liked the school's atmosphere; the classroom was clean, colorful, and well-ventilated. I was also pleasantly surprised by how endearing the kids were. It spoke volumes about the nurturing and supportive environment they experience in class. My son cries a lot every time he has to go to school (he attended 2 preschools before). So I was glad at how easily he adjusted to Eshkol Valley. I am so grateful to the Principal and teachers who created a fun and engaging learning environment for him. Each day, he eagerly looks forward to going to school, and as parents, we couldn't be happier with his experience.",

      "text": "Sending Levin and Leia to Eshkol Valley Pre School has been one of the best decisions we've made! And it is one that we constantly share with our family and friends.  We remember being warmly welcomed by then-principal, Weiting, to principal Audrey and now Jessica who never fails to assure us and allay our doubts. Their genuine care and concern for the children really goes through the roof! Then to the solid team of teachers - who know our children better than we do - a massive THANK YOU! Your big heart, willingness to take every child under your fold, and generous sharing of knowledge and life skills, we're sure, are just some of the qualities that helped our children grow - instilling in them the confidence they need for a good tomorrow! Our special thanks and gratitude goes out to all the teachers who have been so supportive and aunties who have been thoughtfully preparing nutritious food for the children. Thank you once again for blessing them and more!",
