Sandar Win,5,"I was looking for an awning contractor and saw a review about their good service and called them for a quote. Best decision made. They are not your polished contractor/designer sort and are more homely but they give good, practical and cost effective advice and service. Their pricing was not only cheaper than my other quotes but they were more flexible and approachable when I needed changes. When they came onsite to do the work, they were professional and thorough and most importantly experienced. They went beyond the job service to help me check and fix some small faults without us asking - at no extra charge. There are some contractors that are really ""ngiao"" and will be reluctant or black faced but not the case here.  I dealt with Jess and their on ground guy Thomas. I am very pleased with their service and strongly recommend them!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110762037821878706012/reviews
