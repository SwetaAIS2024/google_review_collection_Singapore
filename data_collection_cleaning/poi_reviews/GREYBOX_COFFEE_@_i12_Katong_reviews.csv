Happy Bird,4,"Nice little cafe with okay coffee. Could be better if the coffee was just a little less bitter but maybe it was just the dark roasted beans they've used for their flat white and cappuccino. For those not so into bitter dark roasted coffee, you should opt for their medium roasted varieties. At least their coffee tastes nothing like the  charred burnt tasting coffee of some unnamed large chain coffee establishment.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108716533290322327726/reviews
AA Chin,5,"Chill place overlooking the rest of the mall, great place for chats with friends, parents waiting for kids in the enrichment centres, quiet place to read and have a good coffee and pastry! Staff are professional, responsive and friendly, they know their coffee and take the time to make it just right even tho they can be busy. Keep up the good work Greybox Coffee!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109329887647578120335/reviews
Zachary Ong,5,"Our first time here. The coffee’s a notch above average. And the dirty mocha looks absolutely amazing. Thoroughly impressed!

And I really appreciate they have cake and coffee sets. It’s the most logical strategy to do for cafes but apparently not many cafes implement it.

Good deal and even better coffee!

Keep up the good work Greybox i12 team!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104440453744416839790/reviews
Angel Neo,4,"Recently visited Greybox Coffee at i12Katong! The Americano was rich and full-bodied, the Jasmine Orient Tea has a subtle floral flavor that paired perfectly with the savory treats.

We had chicken sausage and egg wrap was crispy, flavorful, and generously portioned. The service was friendly and the ambiance was cozy and inviting.

However, there was a minor hiccup - our order was mixed up with the customer ahead of us. Fortunately, I was able to swap it myself without fuss.

Considering they're still new, I'll chalk it up to teething issues. Perhaps additional staffing would help streamline their operations.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104392882645878435058/reviews
SG,5,"First visit and super experience! The quality of the cakes and coffee prep is really good! To top it off, excellent service. The service is a distinguishing factor between a good and very good cafe. I was given a specialty latte with cake at the regular set price .. appreciate the sweet gesture. Will return!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118246346124261150049/reviews
