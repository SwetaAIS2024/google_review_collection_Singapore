Since then, I have did root canal treatment, crowning, wisdom tooth extraction procedures with them. Dr Leon Chen is my dentist and I am very comfortable with his service. His calm and assuring demeanour makes a dentist visit pleasant and non-intimidating. Front desk staff and nurses are also generally service- oriented. I would highly recommend Ashford anytime.",

Wasted over 3000$ at Ashford.\nAshford is unnecessarily expensive and I have visited them a few times. They seem more interested in charging you money. One time I went for swollen gum and the dentist took out something stuck in my gum in half a minute. It was supposed to end there but the dentist proceeded to perform regular teeth cleaning without asking my and billed me for it. Just a money hungry unethical practice.",
