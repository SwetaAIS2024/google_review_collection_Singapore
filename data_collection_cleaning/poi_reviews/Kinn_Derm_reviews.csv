grace,5,"I went in the afternoon with family on Sunday and it wasn't super super crowded. This place has very authentic Thai cuisine, the taste isn't artificial and very fresh. I tried the tom yum mini boat noodle and the beef boat noodle, both taste really good and is worth the price. The mini boat noodles can be eaten within 1 or 2 bites and is great for people who don't eat much. Overall, very friendly staff and very good fast service!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107008149555697402529/reviews
Yong-khiam Cheng,5,"Kinn Derm, a Thai restaurant situated in West Coast, Singapore, offers a delightful culinary experience. The menu boasts a diverse range of classic Thai dishes with authentic flavours.

We tried the mini Tom Yum seafood noodles, mini beef soup, boat beef noodle soup, Tamagoyaki gyoza and Mentai gyoza which do not disappoint.

With its inviting ambiance and delectable food, Kinn Derm is worth discovering.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117758155524218325982/reviews

Kenny Pun,5,The food is fantastic and very authentic Thai food. The tom yum ramen is a must try! The recommended wine goes very well with the food. Not forgetting to mention the live band is great and the overall atmosphere is so warm that our family will definitely dine in again!,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111442000830859563676/reviews

The tom yum soup is rich, spicy and leaning towards the sweeter side than sour. Lots of ingredients such as prawns, squid, mussels and shimeji mushroom
