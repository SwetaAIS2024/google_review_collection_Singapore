      "text": "Worst ever hostel I've ever stay, especially for the bathroom and bedroom. When I first came out to this place, there are so many cats. My feet can feel there is many dust in the floor. The air conditioner can't be opened. There is a cockroach in my room. No table, only one chair in a room for 4 people. It seems like my room has never been used for long time and never been cleaned before. The bathroom is tiny, terrible, and have bad smell (little bit gross because of the egg shell in the drain). The bed sheet really dirty. Although i've already cover my pillow with additional shirt, but when I come back to my country and home, I got pus in my head and it's the bad trauma for me. It's kind of nightmare coming back to this hostel in night after I just finished travelling happily in Singapore. It's really hard for me to stay in this hostel for 1 week. Not gonna come to this hostel again although it's cheap and the staff really nice.",

      "text": "Helpful staff. They speak English. Place is clean, but if you are allergic to cats, they have several running around to chase the rats.\nIt is a coed place.\nCheap prices.\nThey don't provide very good bedding. One thin blanket, and usually a less than admirable pillow. They do have a bottom sheet--can't remember if they have a top sheet.\nThey within walking distance to a food court, several temples that offer free food at certain times, and little India--and a few pricy but delicious vegetarian Indian restaurants.\nAlthough they call themselves an art gallery, due to the selection, it must be some kind of tax dodge.\nMake sure you and your taxi driver are reading the street numbers, because a lot of drivers have other hostels in their minds.\nBreakfast consists of white bread, which can be toasted, and jams. I also believe they serve coffee and tea. I definitely wouldn't recommend the breakfast.",

Very cheap compared with other hostels.\n\nBut not good smell and a few unclean small bathrooms.\n\nBreakfast are bread with butter and distasteful jam. And coffee.\n\nFree drinking water both hot and cold. It’s very  good. (Water in sg is very expensive)\n\nSuggest to use Grab car for transportation. Train station is a little bit far.",
