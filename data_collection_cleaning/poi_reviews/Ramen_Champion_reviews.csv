Jonathan Tye,4,"Noodles are made inhouse.
Tsukemen 4.5/5 thick springy noodles, flavourful broth with strong katsuobushi taste. Recommended.
Tonkotsu Ramen 4/5 flavourful porky but not smelly.
Chashu tender and tasty.
Onsen egg failed unfortunately.
Female service staff wasn't happy. No ""thank you"" or ""welcome"" even after we made payment. =(",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111300003378339290657/reviews
Gator,5,"The family was there for dinner. Wanted to try out this restaurant for a long time and finally we were there.

Ordered the tonkatsu ramen and the tempura prawns. The broth was flavourful and the noodles cooked al dente. It seemed that the noodles were made in-house. The entire bowl of ramen also came with a Japanese boiled egg cooked to perfection. With a great salty flavour and the yolk was watery. The char siew was thick and flavourful as well.

The prices were reasonable. Simply decorated and appropriate service standard.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews

Bernard Ong,4,"We came in at lunch time. Right after a group of 18 teenagers just ordered. So waited for our food 20-30mins.

Im surprised the food were fantastic! Great consistency. Frankly, i had no idea what my wife ordered. I just eat whatever dropped on my table. Enjoyed the soup, doesnt leave a strong taste in ur mouth which usually  urge 1 to drink water after.

Like the waitress, calm, matured n good flow. Doesnt rush to get job done. Nice vibe.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115391634503009241978/reviews
