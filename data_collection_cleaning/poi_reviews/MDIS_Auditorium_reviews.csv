Kean Choong,4,"Interesting auditorium filled with statues, (some might say is creepy), half the building are old  the other half is new, there's a gym and a canteen that sell affordable food, a 7-11 right at the corner. Overall not too shabby for a private institution.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115568452701426706050/reviews
