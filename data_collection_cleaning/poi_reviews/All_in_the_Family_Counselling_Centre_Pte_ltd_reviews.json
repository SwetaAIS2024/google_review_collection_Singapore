Similar to the experience by the other reviewer.\n\nIf you are seeking help, don’t get discouraged from getting the help you need from awful booking experiences. Do search on, there are good therapists out there that have helped and I’ve had good experiences with! And they don’t require upfront payment too.",

I am Asian and my husband is German and we both think that her approach was very arrogant for our standards. It might work for extremely pragmatic people or maybe for American culture... In the end instead of getting help, we were both traumatised after our session with Tammy.",
