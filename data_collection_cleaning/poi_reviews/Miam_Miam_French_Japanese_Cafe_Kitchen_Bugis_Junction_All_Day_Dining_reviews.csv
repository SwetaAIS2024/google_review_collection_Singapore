Catherine Tan,4,"It's been a while since I've last visited Miam Miam as the one that used to be near our place had closed. We ordered the Clam De Jus for starter. The slight creamy gravy didn't do much justice to the baby clams. A lighter gravy would probably bring out the taste of the clams better. The Mentaiko Crab Aglio Olio is a fail, or I simply don't know how to appreciate this version of aglio olio. The Souffl√© De Nauge is üëç. The fluffy egg on top is superb. I still remember how good Miam Miam is at their desserts, and the Truffle Chocolate Pancake did not disappoint. We can't even go wrong with their single scoop gelato, which we had a strawberry one topped with marshmallows and a chocolate one topped with cookies. I recommend going for their desserts as well as their rice dishes, which are way better than their pasta.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108571598741145831471/reviews
iris,5,the queue was long for a saturday dinner. i‚Äôm so happy we made reservations in advance. my friends highly recommended the squid ink pasta and it did not disappoint. it came with a whole squid that was crispy in the outside and not too chewy. the pancake was heavenly too. i preferred it over the french toast.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103358886094489340512/reviews
Christopher Ong,5,"The highlight of this cafe has to be the desserts! The Dark Chocolate Souffl√© and the French Toast were the highlight of our lunch and we made sure we had lots of space for it!

The Steak and Eggs and the Carbonara were really good as well for the price point.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105817850083065830780/reviews

Richard Tan,5,"Had lunch here for the first time.

Great service. Good ambience too.

Menu selection of dishes was very appealing. Difficult to decide what to eat.

Crab pasta and pork tonkatsu   tasted great. But the curry rice could be better.

Will go back again to try other dishes.

Parking at this Bugis Junction shopping mall is quite huge. Parking shouldn't be a problem. There is an MRT station very near this mall.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108098066731754425249/reviews
