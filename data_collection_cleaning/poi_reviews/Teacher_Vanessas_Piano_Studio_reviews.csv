Jia Xin Leong,5,"I have been attending piano lessons with Teacher Vanessa for about 6 years now. She is a very patient teacher and also very encouraging during lessons. She has also taught me many techniques which I haven’t been taught by my previous teachers. I have significantly improved in my piano after joining her class. Not only that, she also organises piano concerts for us to perform in front of our families every year to boost our confidence for our exams. She’s definitely a professional piano teacher and I highly recommend her :)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116701886844501373658/reviews

Meow Ling Tan,5,"Ms Vanessa has taught my girls for many years. She is very dedicated and patient towards them. She encourages and stretches the gals every lesson. Attending her lessons was never boring but fun and motivating.
The year end concert was also a great exposure for the gals to perform in front of a crowd. This instilled confidence in them and made exam less daunting.
Thank you Ms Vanessa!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112549618696052983906/reviews
