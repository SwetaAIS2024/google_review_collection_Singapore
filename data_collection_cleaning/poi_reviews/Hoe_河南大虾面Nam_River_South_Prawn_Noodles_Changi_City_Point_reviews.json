The prawn noodles soup was flavourful and delicious! The prawns are big. Fried fritters were good too and nice to go along with the prawn noodles. Do expect a long queue during lunch time.",

      "text": "Aircon, mall. Comfortable, staff serves to you. Most worthwhile 1030-1130am. I ordered dry noodles, which comes with a small plate mock goose and chrysanthemum tea ($8.80, the promo. Had some trouble ordering through QR, staff still honoured the free drink). Expert presentation because it looks like many prawns, actually each prawn is split half and placed on top. The soup is ok, the dry noodles seasoning is ok. Nothing remarkable, nothing bad either. Shared a plate Set B (ngoh hiang, fish cake, spring roll, prawn fritters) with colleague. Spring roll is really oily, colleague said is like putting on a layer of lip glossüíÑü´¶. Spring roll is too nauseating, we did not finish. The other items are ok. I would not purposefully make a trip to eat, will eat if walk by and feel like it.",

      "text": "Had lunch here on a Sunday.  It was quite quiet when we entered around 1115 am, but began to fill up with customers 20 minutes later.\n\nStaff were helpful and friendly. Ordering is done via a QR code - if you cannot use the QR, the staff can help you order but you have to wait as they only have one machine.\n\nThe food was okay.  The wuxiang was freshly fried and crispy and non oily, which was great.  The prawn crackers did not have a prawn on top, and the ngoh hiang and the sotong yutiao were okay, though we did not really get the sotong taste.\n\nWe both had the dry prawn noodles, though mine had the black sauce.  The normal peppery sauce was much better.  Both came with two fresh prawns, and mine had two pieces of pork ribs.  The ribs were rather disappointing - they seemed to have been used in the making of the stock, and ended up rather dry, bland and tasteless.\n\nBoth noodles came with a choice of drinks and you can select from a variety of coffee or tea.",

Surprise The waitress prepare the dish by herself, resulting in cold components. Later the chef come back and prepare for the other table.",
