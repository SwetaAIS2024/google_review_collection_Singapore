Really enjoyed the fried batter!\n\nAlso tried Soy (sweet savory) & Korean spicy (not too spicy) variants, cannot really pick a fav! All pretty safe choices too.\n\nWe will happily order again!",

      "text": "omg a very small nondescript kiosk in the cimb plaza basement - blink and u would have missed it . thankfully my fellow foodie friends alerted me to this hidden gem because WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE\n\nSALT has ruined ALL other fried chicken for me no cap ðŸ˜­ the honey soy sauce is sweet but not cloying, the batter and chicken skin remains crispy in spite of the sauce, and the chicken flesh moist and juicy. it's rly rly amazingly good\n\nwhen the staff/owner? proudly proclaimed that she hasn't had better fried chicken before, i blurted \"sure or not???\" but for lunch today, i ate not only the best chicken ever, i also had to eat my words. her confidence rly wasn't misplaced.\n\nthe shop also sells Chinese soups that look really gao and delicious - branded  under the name \"hebrews\". always a sucker for witty wordplay.\n\ni love the biblical references in the branding. also the food is so good even non-believers would gladly convert to christianity because u will see God after having a taste\n\nthey even provide gloves for eating the wings which is such a thoughtful gesture",

      "text": "# 2nd review# (4 days later)\nThe red wine chicken is my hands-down recommendation. It's actually the best I've tried from any restaurant or hawker stall. The flavor is rich, gingery, and has a pleasant alcoholic kick. I chose to pair it with mee sua.\n\nAs for the sous vide chicken bento set, it was decent, the portion of rice is generous.\n\n#1st review#\nI tried all the fried chicken wings, and loved every single one! So crispy and tasty.  For soup, I had the ginseng and danggui chicken soups. They were flavourful, but the chicken was a little dry, probably because they boiled it a long time to get all that flavour into the broth.",

Even the salad mix itself was so good, they used 4 different types of veggies and mine included kale which I loved! Chicken was crispy and juicy. Glad that I discovered this stall and will be back to try other options.",
