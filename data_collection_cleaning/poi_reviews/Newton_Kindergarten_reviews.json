      "text": "We're impressed that the teachers and the staff pay so much details attention to help our child to grow. The teachers are very patient and have so much experience to deal with each different child. The staff at the office also very attentive and responded quickly. The paperwork was a breeze when our child started the school. The tuition is fair and affordable for the quality of the very experienced teachers. The hours isn't too short either. Our child learned a lot.\nSome activity offered during the school breaks so the kids can keep on the schedule. The children also taught by the teachers for getting along & be confident. Our child now growing more in socializing skills and know how to share. For a young child understanding that the teachers so loving. We were surprised how much the teachers put so much effort for the young students.\nWe're so glad that our child attending this school.\nHowever the teachers and the staffs also human beings if they are lacking any perfect expectations, we will not take it personally. We're rather be thankful and grateful.\nThank you Newton Kindergarten for your love. May God count your every good work and obedient hearts to please Him.",

      "text": "I am Olivia Quek. I graduated from this school in 2017 and I am now a Primary Six in Raffles Girls’ Primary School. I had so much fun at this school. The teachers were all very caring and kind, especially 刘老师, a teacher I have been trying to find but unfortunately I do not have her contact. She was my favourite teacher and I think she is an amazing Chinese teacher. I feel indebted to her for creating my passion for Chinese and caring for me as if I was her own child. I feel like I learnt a lot at this school, building my foundation for English and Chinese to help me excel in Primary School. Thank you and I hope your children have similar experiences.",
