Which may suit some taste buds.\n\n2nd visit:\nRare rain amidst the heat wave. Was craving for some soup to warm the gut. Same stall, same turtle soup but had a larger portion which was served in a claypot. Arguably flavour was better kept in claypot than porcelain. And on a crowded PH morning, a table was easy to come by in this corner of the hawker food centre.",
