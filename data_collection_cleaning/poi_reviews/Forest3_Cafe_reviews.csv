Faith,5,"I’m surprised their karaoke song selection has much more to choose than actual karaoke places! You get to sing for free when you order drinks but if you dare to in front of everyone in the public space 😂 the wait for your turn can be long when the place gets crowded. But it’s interesting how despite this, it’s still good to chat around your table and you can still hear everyone easily; the music volume is set to perfect

There is also darts machine around! Which is fun to play and chill with friends.

Food wise there isn’t anything special but just typical finger food. Price is average for bars.

The Sapporo beer is great though!

The staff are friendly and nice and quite attentive when it comes to passing the microphones and also changing the beer tower.

A great place!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116899979553818556489/reviews
