슈짐JIMGGAS,5,"5$ for a good cup of iced oat milk latte, super worth! they even ground the beans freshly in front of you
it was a perfect balance between milk and coffee, i could still taste the aroma of the coffee beans.

SNEHA P,5,desperately needed a caffeine boost and chanced upon this stall - got the iced oat latte and it was so good and STRONG! i always struggle with finding strong espresso based coffee so i was pleasantly surprised. no complaints except a bit bitter for my liking next time ill ask for a bit of sugar/syrup but it really jolted me awake so i’m super happy! will patronise regularly ❤️ (updated price is $6 nett for iced i think it’s reasonable),2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115893090724027321476/reviews
Novita Santoso,1,"Overprice and not nice at all.
$9 for ice matcha latte in hawker center is quite ridiculous. I understand price for all food supplies inrease but this price is crazy!
Bought Ice matcha latte the price and quality is not even on par.
As per seen on photo, the cup is bigger than the quantity of drinks.
I buy from shopping mall better.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111932966056851929252/reviews
Michelle,1,"$9 for only this overpriced Kyoto matcha latte. Taste is quite good but will not order again.
1st cup: Espresso that’s 20% filled
2nd cup: Ice matcha latte that is half filled even with ice
3rd cup : 1/3 filled matcha latte

Tidus T,3,Decided to give it a try. Americano on the bitter side. Not my liking and quite bland after a few sips. And I guessed the barista not in a good mood... Sorry.... I might have startled you when I take pic of you making coffee.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102846047549633190445/reviews
