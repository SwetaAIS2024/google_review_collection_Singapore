Rest of the dishes such as the tempura as well as salmon mentai rice bowl was decent too. The only thing I don't like is the green soba noodle which had a metallic taste. Place is small with a small indoor area as well as an outdoor area by the side walk. Reservation is recommended.",

It literally melts in my mouth)\n\n- Uni 20grams (8/10, Portion is really worth the price but quality is not too bad. I love how creamy it was with each bite)\n\n- Ikura sushi (9/10!, a burst of umami in your mouth)\n\n- Aburi mentai hana maki salmon (6/10, Least favourite as it was too salty for me)\n\nOverall damage: $100++ incl. gst & svc charge\n\nI will come by soon again",
