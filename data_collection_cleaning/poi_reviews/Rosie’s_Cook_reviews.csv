Steve Lai,5,"Just giving an honest 5* solely based on the food and quality. The owners(Mother and daughter team i suppose?) are really friendly and nice people with 5* good service. They deserved all the praises. Mee soto, mee rabus, mee siam, nasi lemak, etc, these were my daily go to for many months when they are newly opened.... Not until... when there are times their (maybe) relative/friend is helping and managing their orders. Everytime i ordered from the relative/friend, she gave a pathetic small amount of chilli, less than a teaspoon that is totally not the usual amount given by the owner. And when i asked for more chilli sauce, she took the opportunity to say additional chilli at $0.50. That's it...! that was the Last time i visited.

Not going to vent my anger by giving low review. I'm still giving a 5* as I just want to be fair to the owners, their food is really good and at the right price. It's a shame when their service standards are done badly when the relative/friend is helping out... they did lose 1 loyal customer for sure~",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106685200452618573143/reviews
