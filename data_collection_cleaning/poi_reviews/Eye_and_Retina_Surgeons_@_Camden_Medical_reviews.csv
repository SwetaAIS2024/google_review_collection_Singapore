C Naz,1,"Too many staff hovering at counters. They chat to one another, making the small reception area more noisy and crowded than necessary. I also find the staff rude, they barge in the clinic when the doctor is giving a diagnosis. I find this young man (think he had a ear-ring) arrogant and constantly interupted Dr Chee Soon Phaik while she was with the patient. He barges into the clinic, and stands and talks while she is checking or speaking to her patients. Considering the amount this clinic charges, I expect better service and uninterrupted time with the doctor. If this continues, noisy rude staff will ruin the clinic's reputation.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105144272294294438224/reviews
Christine P,5,"Dr Daniel Su is amazing - extremely patient, detail oriented and always ready to answer questions. I needed a second opinion re recent retina diagnosis and was blessed to come across his contact. I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone who needs an eye evaluation.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111748281328988940147/reviews
Ganesh Vengadasalam,5,I had a good experience. I sent an appointment request via email and the clinic responded and confirmed my appointment on the same day within a few hours.

Jsj LT,1,"My daughter had eye swelling last month and her usual brilliant eye specialist was away on holiday. Dr Su was informed to be her replacement. My daughter went to see Dr Su who cursorily gave her a short consultation, dispensed an eye cleanser she was already using and charged a large fee. She is a teenager. A few days later, she was still not better and she waited till her usual doctor was back to consult her. My daughter’s eye was fine after her usual doctor prescribed eye drops. The insurance now asked for a memo for us to claim and Dr Su is asking for $50! Horrors. I think I will report him to the MOH. He did not remedy my daughter’s situation but asked for more money.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104784558101191055301/reviews
Eleanor Koe,5,"Best eye clinic experience and have been regularly going for check ups here. Doctors are extremely knowledgeable and patient, and explain things very well. They are also clearly the best in their field and their advice is well thought out, considered and experienced. All in all, it is always an extremely pleasant and relaxing experience, which is rare to me personally especially when clinics/hospitals always feel very cold, intimidating and unpersonal. Going for medical check-ups are already scary enough! Would highly recommend.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102445579087558153454/reviews
