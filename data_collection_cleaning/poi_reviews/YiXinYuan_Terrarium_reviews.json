      "text": "We had the wonderful opportunity to do terrariums with my kids, and it was an incredibly therapeutic experience, both for them and for me. The activity was a great way to connect with nature while exploring creativity.\n\nThe owners (kelvin, jack, and hui hui) were exceptionally kind and patient, guiding the kids every step of the way. They provided clear instructions and were genuinely invested in helping the kids refine and perfect their ideas. Their encouragement and support truly made the experience enjoyable and educational.\n\nWhat stood out to me the most was seeing the spark of creativity in my kids as they brought their unique visions to life. Itâ€™s a fantastic activity for children to learn, grow, and express themselves.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this experience to anyone looking for an engaging, family-friendly activity. Kudos to the team for creating such a welcoming and inspiring environment!",
