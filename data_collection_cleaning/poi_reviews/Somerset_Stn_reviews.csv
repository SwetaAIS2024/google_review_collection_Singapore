Elle,5,"a very useful bus stop that not only provides shelter to civilians walking nearby, but also is a stop for many buses! it connects buses to somerset mrt, as well as the malls 111 somerset and 313 somerset! the newly opened skate park is right next to it too! we would definitely recommend using this bus stop.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106013306939322706772/reviews
Flo Yeow,5,"It's not easy to miss this bus stop. Being opposite 313 Somerset, it's very crowded especially during peak travel times. Many buses pass by here, and brings you to many directions as well.

This makes a better bus stop vs the next few ones at Orchard, as this is probably the final stop that aggregates every bus in the same direction, before they all split. Also, the shelter. There's an underground from the basement of 313 and from the Somerset MRT station that shelters you through to the bus stop as well, if you know how to walk the underground during rainy days.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
