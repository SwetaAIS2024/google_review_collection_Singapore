Being Chinese makes me feel that I prefer a good family church that teaches Bible and integrated into our Chinese moral values. I like the diversity in our church community with  Singaporeans and people from other countries like Malaysia, China Taiwan. It’s family-oriented and focused on family, marital, career, life issues and the biblical teachings are taught in a way non-believer and new believer can understand. I previously went to other churches for a couple of years. I find myself anchored in this church.  I joined since 2021. The church has many activities and various 主日学 Bible teachings on every Sunday from 9am to 10am. Church service starts from 10:30am and usually end at 12 noon. Our church community is  close-knitted. We have cell groups twice monthly. Our pastor is very gentle person and committee leaders care for every people. In our church, everyone knows everyone. You can find support here.', 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': 'I’m English-educated Singaporean.
