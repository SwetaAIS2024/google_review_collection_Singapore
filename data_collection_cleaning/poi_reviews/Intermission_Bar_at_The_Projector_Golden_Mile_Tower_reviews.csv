Morgan Ee,3,"Nice vibes! price points are a little high for what you get, but I guess thatâ€™s similar across all cinema food options. I got the karaage ($12) and the portion was average, tastes exactly like frozen karaage from NTUC so I wouldnâ€™t recommend ðŸ’” the pepperoni pizza ($18) was also a 5/10, rlly thin crust and the tomato based sauce was way too sweet

The loaded nachos and toasties looked better though so I would recommend those instead",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115063102245675768284/reviews
