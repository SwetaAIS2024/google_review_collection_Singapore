Despite this, the mosque remains a tranquil escape from the surrounding activity",

      "text": "Alhamdullilah. It is a gem to find a masjid in the middle of street within the CBD that is full of worldly bustle. The interior is so peaceful and allows one to unwind from his/her worries. It is run primarily by the Tamil-Muslim community so if you aren’t used to a different style of prayers, you may want to consider someplace else (quite speedy and no provision for Ruku’).\n\nFor drivers, as many before me have mentioned, it can be quite difficult as you’d imagine in the CBD. If streetside parking isn’t available, there’s Frasers Tower along Telok Ayer St.",
