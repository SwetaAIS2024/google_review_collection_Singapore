      "text": "I would like to lodge a serious complaint regarding the service at Mr Bean, Suntec City.\nThere is an older lady staff member who consistently displays a very poor attitude towards customers. Every time I visit, she ignores customers and tells them to wait, claiming she is \"busy,\" without even basic courtesy or acknowledgment.\nDuring my most recent visit — which will definitely be my last — she completely ignored me even though I was standing right in front of the counter. After waiting for about a minute without any response, I had to leave and buy from another store as I was rushing to work.\nThis experience was extremely disappointing and unacceptable, especially coming from a well-known brand like Mr Bean.\nI sincerely hope that the management will look into this matter seriously and take appropriate action to improve service standards at this outlet.",

Bean curd drink was not strained, was intimidating. Service was non existent, staff did not acknowledge customer and nothing was said.",

They sold out of chocolate pancake and then lied to me and gave me a red bean one saying it’s the “last one left”. Unethical way of doing business!! I’ve reached out to ask for a refund but no response either. I was really looking forward to a chocolate pancake and I am really disappointed by this experience.",
