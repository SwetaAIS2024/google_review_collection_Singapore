Galaxy Cheah,4,"Well stocked minimart. Most minimarts usually stock your standard items like canned food, instant noodles, bread, eggs, newspaper, toilet paper, carton drinks and maybe some onions n garlic.
This minimart also has a big section of fridges with a fairly good selection of fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and some frozen meat.
They also stock a good variety of flour for baking cakes, bread and even Atta flour for making roti.
There is also a small hardware section selling taps, hoses, pliers, electrical items, etc in case you need to do some minor home repairs
Good enough for you to survive the lockdown without having to travel to a bigger, more crowded (higher risk) supermart.
Update: They used to close by 10pm, now they are open until 11pm to cater to the nurses amd F&B workers who come home  later than 10pm.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100605962366729363823/reviews
