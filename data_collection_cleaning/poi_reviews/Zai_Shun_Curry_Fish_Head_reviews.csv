Reiko H,5,"If you‚Äôre looking for one of Singapore‚Äôs best spots for a hearty and authentic Teochew-style meal, Zai Shun Curry Fish Head is an absolute must-visit! Known for its incredibly fresh seafood and perfectly executed dishes, this humble eatery has earned a loyal following over the years‚Äîand for good reason.

Their signature Curry Fish Head is a showstopper. The fish is always fresh, tender, and cooked to perfection, while the curry strikes the perfect balance between rich, tangy, and mildly spicy, complementing the fish without overpowering its natural sweetness. It's a dish that keeps diners coming back for more!

Beyond the curry fish head, Zai Shun is also famous for its steamed fish selection, featuring premium options like Soon Hock, Parrot Fish, and Red Garoupa. Each fish is expertly steamed to retain its delicate texture and natural flavors, paired with a light soy sauce that enhances its sweetness. Their homemade tofu, bitter gourd with salted egg, he bi hiam (dried shrimps in sambal & spices) and chap chye are also crowd favorites‚Äîsimple yet incredibly flavorful.

Despite its popularity, the prices remain reasonable for the quality you get. The eatery operates in a no-frills, hawker-style setting, so expect a casual dining experience with quick service. However, do come early, as their best dishes sell out fast, especially on weekends!

Since 2017, Zai Shun Curry Fish Head has been consistently recognized in the Michelin Guide's Bib Gourmand list, offering high-quality food at reasonable prices. This recognition underscores the restaurant's commitment to delivering exceptional Teochew-style dishes, including their renowned curry fish head, in fact the owner of this infamous restaurant confidently assured me that he only served fresh fish to his patrons.

In summary, whether you‚Äôre a local food lover or a visitor hunting for authentic Singaporean flavors, Zai Shun Curry Fish Head is a must-try. One taste, and you‚Äôll understand why it‚Äôs one of the city‚Äôs most beloved dining spots!

Renee Ong,4,"Finding seats may be difficult, we went around 11.14am, took 10mins, Queuing for order very long but was served very fast.

A popular eating place that deserved Michelin Star. Although never try their curry fish head. Bitter gourd fried egg was the best of all the dishes. Two other vegetable dishes not recommended.

Price quite reasonable, $121 for 7pax.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111880374353850126940/reviews
Vin W,4,"I enjoyed the fast service, though there was lunch crowd.
The tried dishes were decent and reasonably priced.
The standout for me was the tender and flavorful Tongpo Pork. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try their steamed fish, but I'm looking forward to visiting again soon to give it a try.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109263427873687540100/reviews
Ashen Hog,4,"Went there for lunch with my family. Food was decent. Price was decent. Service was good. The staff saw we had kids at the table and brought extra sets of plates and bowls without us asking.

There was a queue but didn't take us too long to have our orders taken. Took like 10 mins wait. Fish curry dish took a while to arrive though.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117162713390073958493/reviews
