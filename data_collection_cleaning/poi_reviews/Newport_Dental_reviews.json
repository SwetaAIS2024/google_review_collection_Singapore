      "text": "Doctor Divya may look scary at first (just like any other dentists) but sheâ€™s super professional and she actually took the time to go the extra mile for some of my appointments (as I forgot to mention that I want to do filling on top of scaling and polishing). She explains what sheâ€™s going to do and why she has to do it so that I have some clarity in my concerns (Iâ€™m pretty scared of the dentist cos of very bad experiences). She ensures that thereâ€™s little-to-no-pain in my visits and always does her job efficiently. Some visits still hurts but itâ€™s worth it if extra care and attention was given by the doctor. Pricing wise, Iâ€™m not that experienced but as a newly-working adult, I think itâ€™s still pricey. But I guess itâ€™s manageable after awhile. Depends on what service you opt for. The doctorâ€™s assistant and the clerk at the desk is always friendly too! They ensure that Iâ€™m comfortable and always patient when I had to reschedule my appointments for the umpteenth time ðŸ˜­ thank you for your professionalism and patience!!!",
