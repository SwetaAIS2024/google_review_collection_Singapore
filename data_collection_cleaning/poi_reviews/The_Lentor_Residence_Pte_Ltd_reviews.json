Not even half a year later, they move her to a Level 5 room without informing us first. Zero alternatives given, zero communication. Administration pushes everything to the nursing managers who inadvertently leave things out cos of how busy they are. Very poor protocols and SOP, rooms are really bare bones and it's not worth it if the fees are not subsidized.",
