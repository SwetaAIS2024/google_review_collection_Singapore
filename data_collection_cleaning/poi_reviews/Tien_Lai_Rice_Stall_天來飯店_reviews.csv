Cheow Mong Chan,5,"Always stall with long queue, today on leave so have time to queue.
Ordered takeaway.
Roast duck, meat was soft, tasty. Chili enhanced the flavour.
Char siew, not too good, maybe not sufficient fats cause very lean meat.
Definitely a place to come again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116936834742186304043/reviews
Em woo,5,"Very nice decent plate of roasted pork belly and char siew. Portion size was good enough for me. Really liked the lean and nicely charred char siew and the crispy pork belly was very crispy! Skin is super crispy and tasty! Had way more meat than rice so itâ€™s quite worth it. Added an egg and the total cost was $5.30. Price wise is also reasonable!

The queue never stops so make sure you come early!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106219834003454494418/reviews
ray gan,4,"One of the better roasts meat stalls in the west, there is always a queue but it moves quickly. My favorite is the char siew with roast duck combo, and the nice gravy. $5.50.

Khoo Chee Yam,5,"Finally got a chance to try the food, but it was so popular that the last roasted duck was ordered by the customer at the front of the queue ðŸ˜¡
Settled with char siew and roasted pork rice. The chilli elevated the overall tasting experience. The stalled is showcase in Michelin guide for a reason.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114844620013502309635/reviews
Sean Goh,4,"Have alway wanted to try this stall for the longest of time. Finally managed to find a day on weekday to come Taman Jurong Food Centre. This stall is well known for their roast items like Charsiew, roast duck and roast meat. There was already a long queue when i reached, there was at least 15pax ahead of me. Queued for almost 25mins before it was my turn to order.

Ordered the charsiew rice which was SGD$4. The portion of the meat was quite generous to be honest. Charsiew was nicely roasted, there are bits of char and charsiew is more on the sweet side. Their chili also deserved a mention, it goes really well with the charsiew.

Overall, the food was fantastic. The roast duck looks equally fabalous, wouldnt mind trying the next time round. I would definitely recoomend this stall if you dont mind the long queue.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
