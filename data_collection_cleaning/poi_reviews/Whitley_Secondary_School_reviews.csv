Mindy Mindy,5,"My son attends Whitley and has so far had a great experience. He‚Äôs really broken out of his shell while there and I think the smaller class sizes help. There are only 26 in his class! The teachers and the staff are all very caring and really seem to have a heart for the kids. Whenever I am at the school, I notice the kids are always very kind and respectful. Definitely not what I expected from this ‚Äúneighborhood‚Äù school. üòÜ I would definitely recommend Whitley, especially for those kids who might be a bit shy and would appreciate a smaller class than the typical 40.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101976374262641517203/reviews
Z M,5,"Parent of student in school. Good school leadership and community which organize many festivities and school activities for students. There are many good CCAs and leadership roles for the students. The school community has been preparing meals and safe environment (for at least 7 years and counting) for graduating students who are going to take major exams. This shows the community and staff are doing their best, with love and care, for their students.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100863581699999769363/reviews
Tan Adiah,5,"I was initially sceptical about Whitley Secondary School, as I shortlisted it due to distance and its Cut-Off Point (COP). However, I have never regretted the decision. My daughter thrived at Whitley, where she was given numerous opportunities to explore and develop her potential.

A big part of this growth was due to the school's leadership and dedicated teachers. Mrs Anba was instrumental in transforming the school's culture; her genuine and firm approach made a lasting impression. Special thanks to Miss Ong and Miss Winnie, who played pivotal roles in shaping my daughter into a confident and responsible prefect, despite her initial reluctance.

Even after graduating, my daughter continues to enjoy serving the school, which speaks volumes about the positive experiences she had. I wholeheartedly recommend Whitley Secondary School for its nurturing environment and committed staff. It was a decision I‚Äôll never regret.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105423817357668651857/reviews
Amber Lim,5,Previous student from here and felt that the environment was better then I thought when entering. Many people have prejudice thoughts about Whitley but without experiencing it for yourself it‚Äôs hard to say. May be a neighbour school in comparison but it made us a close knit community. Teachers are so nice and care about student‚Äôs wellbeing. Whitley has nurtured so many of my friends to work hard but to also enjoy our secondary school journey in the process.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104694037461322425057/reviews
Ashlyn Kaur,5,Graduated from Whitley Sec 2 years ago. Made great memories with everyone there. The teachers act as our friends and we can count on them to always give us their time and listening ear whenever we have our doubts. Our principal is equally as friendly and never fails to greet us and talk to us occasionally along the walkways. The new rennovation has also made Whitley more vibrant and pleasant for the students.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114593012112241469532/reviews
