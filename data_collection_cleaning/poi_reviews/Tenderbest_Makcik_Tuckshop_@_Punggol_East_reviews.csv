Kai,4,"The food standard stayed pretty much the same after these years. Pretty good.

The counter staff were nice to advice against not having ice in the bandung as its too sweet. üëç

When the food was ready, our buzzer did not go off. Believe due to low battery. One of the younger staff came over to find our buzzer. I have pet peeve of eating food that was left cold, and I snapped at him a little.

I'm sorry young bro, its my bad. You were kind enough to come find us. üòû

The food was still a little warm, thankfully. Alls still good.

Would visit again!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103961412486889059100/reviews

I even ordered the 2nd round. üòÇ The food is nice, the staff is friendly, the environment is cool and the Renovation and Christmas decor is awesome.
