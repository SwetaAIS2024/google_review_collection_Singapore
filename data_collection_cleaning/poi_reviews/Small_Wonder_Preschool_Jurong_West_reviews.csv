Christopher Liew,5,"My boy is lucky because the teacher cares about him so much! The teacher helped him in the transition from hating school to loving it. Now he‚Äôs like a ‚Äúschool ambassador‚Äù welcoming to the new kids and parents to the schoolü§£.

The teacher has resigned to pursue her degree in early childhood education. Happy for her to advance studies and follow her passion, wishing her all the best‚Ä¶!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102755542543393913978/reviews

Nancy Lim,5,"Very touched by the staff and teachers, esp teacher Irene, aunty Teng and aunty Yap. My son, Aidan, was so well taken care of that when I transferred him to another childcare ctr due to our relocation, I had to 'quarantine' him at home for the last 2 weeks so that he wont be traumatised when he goes to his new childcare ctr. N thanks aunty Teng for your farewell gift to him. Thx alot!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113185451983410156384/reviews
