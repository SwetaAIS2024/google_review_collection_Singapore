      "text": "Seems like the male pharmacist (wears specs, forgot his Chinese name) is quite blur and totally regret asking him and buying the medicine.\n\nAfter the lady in front of me in the queue paid for the medicine he turned his attention to me and asked what I needed but the lady was still standing at the counter bcos he was still holding on to her medicine without realising and she had to remind him she hasn’t walked away bcos he hasn’t passed her the medicine LOL.\n\nAfterwards, I asked for vomitting medicine but he was replying so quietly and I could barely hear him throughout. He looked like he was forced to work as a pharmacist there. Worst part is that he gave me the wrong medicine and it didn’t have effect and when I went to the doctor, the doctor told me the medicine was meant for diarrhoea… Jesus Christ man, how is this guy a certified pharmacist?",
