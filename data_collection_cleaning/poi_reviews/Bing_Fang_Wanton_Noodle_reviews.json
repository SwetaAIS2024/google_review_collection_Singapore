Surprisingly well priced, decent, tasty wanton mee with q noodles (not yeasty kind) executed in al dente fashion, served with 3 plump wantons stuffed with meat and chestnut for solid mouthfeel. Char siews are decent portions sliced nicely but would be better if it had a roastier flavor. Putting this on steady dabao roster!",

Portion & ingredients was quite a lot for $5.50.\nAlso tried the fried wanton, but felt the fried pork was better.\nDefinitely worth a try if you are nearby in bukit batok area.",
