      "text": "#1st review#\nThe stall prepares their dumplings and baos fresh every day. Today, I had the opportunity to try the following:\n1. Xiao long bao - It was juicy and delicious. Definitely a dish I would order again.\n2. Hot and sour soup - The spiciness was just right. Personally, I found it slightly sweet, but I believe locals would enjoy this flavor profile.\n3. Sheng jian bao\n\n#2nd review (two weeks later)#\nToday I tried the spicy chili oil wanton and I really enjoyed it. The wanton skin was smooth, and the filling was delicious. Moreover, the sauce was flavorful and added an extra kick to the dish.",

They tasted really good & 4 pieces were really not enough!\n\n4 months later, I went back to the same place but this time I was a bit disappointed…. The bao is not as crispy like before & there is also lesser “soup” inside the bao…\n\n& the 口感also not as good as before :-(\n\nThe difference can be seen between the pictures…. 1st two were taken in Oct 2022 & 3rd one taken in Mar 2023…",
