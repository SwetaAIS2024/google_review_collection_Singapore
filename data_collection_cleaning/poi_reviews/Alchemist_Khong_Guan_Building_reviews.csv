Ed,4,"Came for a filter brew after workout.
Pleasant atmosphere and very chilled with soft music. Coffee selections good though a bit on the pricey side. Filter brew was ok but a bit light and couldn’t taste the notes. Didn’t eat but might try the pastries next time.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104056554846052732887/reviews
Chim Mei,4,"Stepping into Alchemist Khong Guan Building felt like entering a time capsule—classic, vintage, and undeniably unique. There was something almost surreal about sitting in that quiet corner, sipping my coffee while gazing out the window. The view wasn’t breathtaking, but it carried a strange charm, like a glimpse into the past.

The coffee was amazing, rich and aromatic. The croissant, unfortunately, was just okay—nothing extraordinary, but decent enough. For a while, I truly enjoyed the peaceful solitude, though the arrival of a lively group later did disrupt the quiet ambiance.

Despite that, the cafe’s distinctive character made the visit worthwhile. If you appreciate nostalgia and superb coffee, this place is worth experiencing—just maybe not during peak hours if you crave silence.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101044726506569224192/reviews
Adrian Chan,5,"Chanced upon this alchemist branch and decided to get a coffee here. Indoor seat is nice and spacious but there aren't many seats available. Coffee is very good, and there was also a choice of the beans to be used. Staff was quite friendly.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109957919811943890317/reviews
Pankaj,3,"Minimalistic cafe near Tai Seng offering a concise menu dominated by coffee. Popped in on a Sunday, and the place surely looked like its regulars were streaming in. Ordered a latte with the ""dark matter"" roast but was quite disappointed as it tasted very weak despite asking for a regular size. My friend ordered a flat white, which seemed better. Around 13 sgd for two. Try if the taste suits you but not so much for me.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103569609455800860012/reviews
Asia Apparel,5,"Clean chic cafe walking distance from our factory. For so many years, we normally do takeaways. Today sit down and have a drink and relax. Very comfortable. Will come to sit in more often.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112168507594751691491/reviews
