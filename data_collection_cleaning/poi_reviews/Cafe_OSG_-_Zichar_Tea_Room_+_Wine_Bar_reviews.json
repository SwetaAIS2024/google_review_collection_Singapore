      "text": "Definitely a 5 stars for it's atmosphere to chill and cleanliness of the restaurant. Came here a couple of times wanted to chill for a drink or 2 and end up being here for more than 5hrs and had many multiple orders of beers.\nThe beers here is fresh, the Sapporo is one of the fresher draft beers which is always constantly fresh for these few times.\nI quite like the beef rendang lunch set too, easy to eat, meat is quite soft too. The hokkien mee is average, abit on the salty side.\nGood place for meetings, gatherings or chillouts. The Aircon is good too even on a hot sunny day, the restaurant is still cooling, sometimes even over too cold especially when it rains.",
