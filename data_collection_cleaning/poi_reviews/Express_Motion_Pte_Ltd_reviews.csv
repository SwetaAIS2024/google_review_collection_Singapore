Dream88Win,1,"I visited this workshop last Friday, January 10th, to address issues with my Toyota Sienta's air conditioning, specifically hot air blowing. Unfortunately, they were unable to pinpoint the root cause of the problem. Due to the late hour and heavy rain, I decided to seek assistance from another workshop.

To my dismay, the second workshop quickly identified the issue and found dislodged hot and cold vent gear mechanism has dislodged. This required disassembly and an additional cost of $300 to rectify.

I returned to the original workshop on 16 Jan 2025 to express my disappointment with their initial diagnosis. However, my concerns were dismissed, and boss, Mary, argued that their initial checks were standard procedure and that my expectations were unreasonable.

I am extremely dissatisfied with the level of service and the apparent incompetence of the technicians at this workshop. I will not be returning for future services and strongly advise others to exercise caution when considering their services",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117806815797125612346/reviews
R C,1,"Went to this shop to install OBU.  As I was about to leave, I was asked to pay $110 for boot lights which I didn’t ask for.  I confronted the lady boss which she replied that she can remove them if I don’t want it.  I asked for her to remove and the mechanic took 15 mins to do so.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110376686013008277269/reviews
