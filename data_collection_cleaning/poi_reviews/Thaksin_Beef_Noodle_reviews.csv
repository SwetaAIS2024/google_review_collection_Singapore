khrhms,4,Not as good as i remembered it to be when they had a stall in Clementi but still a hearty bowl of beef noodle and plate of pad thai. You could spice it up with their chili flakes and pretty generous chunks of beef given. Friendly service and food was served super quick! Satisfied my cravings.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
S WK,3,"Ordered pad Thai beef. The portion is relatively small for the price $8.50. Taste is up to expectation. For person who prefer larger portion, it may not be the one.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107787092131683969196/reviews
Mr J,4,"This Halal beef noodles stall intrigued me. Clean and clear of clutter, it stood out a little from the rest. First sip and the hot, rich and flavourful soup disnt disappoint. Choice of yellow noodles, bee hoon or kway teow, I had a choice of just plain beef or mixes with offal. Of course, I chose mixed. Beef was nice and tender, although not melt in your mouth. The offal was well done too. Don't forget the condiments to enhance your flavour!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110048148088114334117/reviews
Botak,3,"Very popular muslim beef noodles, maybe because of the name, which was named after the former Thai PM.

But in my honest opinion, it was average only, because they don't seem to have sliced beef, despite me telling them I wanted only that. But the soup was pretty tasty.

The price was also on the high side at SGD8 per bowl.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100060791396189603978/reviews
Zul M,5,"The Pad Thai and signature beef soup noodle here are nothing short of legendary. The umami flavor? Always on point—like a symphony of taste that hits all the right notes. I first tried this place over a decade ago, and let me tell you, their commitment to quality hasn’t aged a day. It’s like a time capsule of deliciousness that keeps delivering, year after year. Whether you're a loyal fan or a first-timer, this spot knows how to keep your taste buds coming back for more.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118286768499241544620/reviews
