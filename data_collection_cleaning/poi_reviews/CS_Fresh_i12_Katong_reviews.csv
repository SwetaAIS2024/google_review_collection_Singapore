Chee Meng Heng,1,"Bought a box of pears at i12 Katong outlet on 31/12/2024. It was a gift box of 4 pears. Came home to find that one of the pears had its skin crumpled and peeled out. It was hidden under the white packing paper so can’t be seen without opening the box. As there was no phone number to call the outlet, I called and texted with the head office and it has been 15 days since and nothing had been resolved. I refused to bring the pears down to the store for refund because as a matter of principle, why should customers suffer the consequence and be inconvenienced when the store sold bad products?",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107738715921919407140/reviews
Patrick Arnet,2,"The quality and freshness of the products has dropped significantly, for example:
No fresh chicken in the morning, all blueberries were moldy and the packed fresh carrots were frozen ?!
In addition the staff was very unfriendly
Given the higher prices compared to the competitors its just not worth it",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114184321102916871130/reviews
M R,1,"A simple self check out experience made bitter by a staff member. A plastic bag already paid  for was nowhere in sight and when this person was asked she grimaced and rolled her eyes. Weird and bizarre behaviour not called for. Seconds later she yanked out a basket from behind me -which hit my back and she walked off without any indication of an apology. Cold Storage management - please teach your staff to keep their bad moods at bay while they are around customers.When I mentioned to her that the basket had hit my back, she rolled her eyes again and walked off. I was with my child and decided to not make it into a scene. Her name starts with the letter S. I’m sure no one walks around intending to be rude but when it is without reason and is from a staff who is paid to help customers not cause them distress , it needs to be highlighted.any action that has so much as caused any physical contact with a customer without a reasonable cause is a lawsuit waiting to happen. If this was the US, that could’ve been an option. Unfortunately , here, the management won’t even see this and the lady will continue to misbehave at the check out counter",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116185472687209585845/reviews
