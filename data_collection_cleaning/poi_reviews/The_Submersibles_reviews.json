I would definitely recommend this dive company to anyone that is looking for a enjoyable and smooth sailing experience in anything underwater! =)",

He truly went above and beyond, assisting me in getting and fixing up my regulator and dive computer just in time for my trip. His expertise and dedication ensured everything was in perfect condition, giving me peace of mind before my dives. I really appreciate his professionalism and willingness to go the extra mile. Highly recommend him and his shop for anyone looking for quality dive gear and top-notch service!",

The training dives were off Lazarus island, and the DMs (Jonas, a DM in training and Felix) were professional and attentive. They did an excellent job explaining the Dos and Don'ts of debris retrieval, and also ensured our safety in the silty conditions of Singapore waters. I have previously also been on diving trips as a solo diver organised by this company and they've always been very good value for money !",
