Every spoonful was packed with the minced meat, crispy anchovies, and egg. Overall, it was a satisfying and delicious. Perfect for a rainy day or when craving something hearty and homemade!",

While the noodles and soup were the stars of the dish, the prawns felt unnecessary and could be skipped for a cheaper option ($3.30/$3.80). A hearty and satisfying meal overall!",

The soup they put the noodles in is also light and flavourful without being overly salty.\n\nOverall score 4/5",

Mee Hoon Kueh is hand pulled so if you appreciate the traditionally uneven texture, you will love it!\n\nPlease do not expect any service except cooking your dish. Sometimes you might even witness the couple argue. However, without fail, the dish will be cooked right!\n\nThe new coffee shop is much cleaner and it’s spacious and windy.",
