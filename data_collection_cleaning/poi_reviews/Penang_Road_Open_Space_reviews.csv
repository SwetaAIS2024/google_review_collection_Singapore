John a,4,"A small but refreshing green space on the hillside above Orchard Road. A small walking path crosses the open space, and several places to sit make it a terrific spot for a quiet break with a bit of nature to calm a busy day.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115322239165769116221/reviews

Philip,4,Cool to have this random green space in the not-so-green Orchard district. You can spot an occasional chicken here. The only issue with this place is the anti-flood drainage canal by the KPO. On some days it can smell REALLY bad when passing by.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101373269902423824179/reviews
Mark,5,"A relatively rare green space in a very developed city. Not that Singapore doesn't have parks but many of the famous ones are full of people. This one was in a busy area but really a nice quiet place to take a break between shopping, eating, and walking.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111482570215210622763/reviews
TwelveInch Chewbacca,5,My favorite part of each day is walking through this area with my family.  It's is a joyful little moment that is unique each time through. The space is carefully and lovingly maintained for the enjoyment of all who take the time to walk through.  I am torn because I both want to share it as well as keep it as a closely held secret with those who cherish it the way we do.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109099996709422991975/reviews
