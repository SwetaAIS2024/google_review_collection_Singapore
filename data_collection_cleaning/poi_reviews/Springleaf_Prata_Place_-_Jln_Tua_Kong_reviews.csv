Joy KC,4,"Nice spot in the neighborhood for prata. The coin prata & plain prata were light & crisp. Egg prata was light, not too thick and doughy. Mutton murtabak came with generous serving of onions in it. Fish curry was fairly good, butter chicken was tasty though a bit too sweet.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116810438378403865075/reviews
Alex Soo,5,It is how I like my prata to be. Crispy on the outside and soft inside. The mutton curry taste are spot on but portion could have being slightly larger.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112268683474201894113/reviews
Potato Head,4,"Indeed, as many ppl mentioned that here plata is the one of the best in Singapore.
Very crispy outside later and soft layers inside.
Tried with fish curry and chicken curry ( fish is a bit sour , chicken is creamy both good )
Over all, food was pretty good.
Just service staff was rude and order need to wait too long( I waited 40min)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113658781384736931614/reviews
Joey Lee,5,"This is the 2nd time I gone back to Spring Leaf at Jalan Tua Kong for the curry fish head. Love the curry spice and they gave the whole fish head, not half. At the Jalan Tua Kong branch, they have a set deal for the fish head which makes it pretty worthwhile. Not sure if all the branches offer the same deal. The fish head is good for 3-4 people to share. I love to eat it with the crispy egg prata. Perfect combination!!

My family was also warmly welcome by one of the servers (Ms. Raji) that suggested to us that she will placed the fish head curry order first as it takes about 25mins to cook. And later asked if we would like all our food to be serve at the same time. That way, my whole family are able to dine together and enjoy the warm food.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113997649067343794885/reviews
Ben Wang,5,"Decent Prata for regular eating.

I won't say it's the best, but above average. Location is good at this place and free parking hence 5 stars.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105498223825690331319/reviews
