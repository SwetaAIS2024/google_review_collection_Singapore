GoAheadGroupFan,5,"On Friday 21 March 2025, I had the tom yum egg fried rice with shrimp for my lunch at the brand new Bukit Batok West hawker centre, and I liked this meal as tom yum egg fried rice with shrimp tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these other wok fried rice dishes (except for pork chop and pork luncheon meat) from this outlet in the future.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105877449322822053371/reviews

javier plays23,3,"The rice was overly dry, lacks flavour and not oily at all. It was also barely seasoned.

The pork chop was on the tougher side.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109356648728544745958/reviews
