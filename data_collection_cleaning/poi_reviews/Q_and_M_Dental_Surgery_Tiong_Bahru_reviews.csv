Chen Jiarong,5,"Excellent tooth care experience as always, never fail my expectations given Q&M name as an established and well rounded player in the industry. Where theres a need, i can always trust that they are equipped with all necessary specialised tools and equipment like X-ray, be it filling up a cracked tooth etc. I’m also pleasantly surprised that they have good electronic data management system, with my teeth records at other O&M outlets readily available, the dentist can remind me on what was previously done to the concerned tooth and make informed decisions to either remove or perform filling. Always a pleasant experience at Q&M",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100567231061680234969/reviews
