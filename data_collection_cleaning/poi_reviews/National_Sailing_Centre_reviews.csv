trollbanana,1,Had a terrible experience sailing here nothing productive is ever done and the club looks abandoned. Only widely used because it makes itself the grounds for national training if not its quite literally the worse club in Singapore. Non of the staff do anything and when u ask them for help they claim they will do it but they just go and forget about it. Utterly useless,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111226592936492070957/reviews
