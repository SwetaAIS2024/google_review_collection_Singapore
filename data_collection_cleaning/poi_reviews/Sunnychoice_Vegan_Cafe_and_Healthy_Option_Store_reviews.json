Ordering has to be done online even though there were no other customers when we arrived for an early lunch",

      "text": "Since we were in the vicinity of AnchorPoint on March 1, we decided to dine at Sunnychoice Vegan Cafe. We ordered a bowl of Lei Cha, a plate of dry Mee Siam, a plate of veggie sushi, and a glass each of iced lemongrass and Roselle. The food was deliciously prepared, and most importantly, there was no aftertaste of thirst after dining. We noticed that the cook had been transferred from another branch, and we would be happy to visit this cafe again to enjoy her cooking. Additionally, this shop accepts CDC vouchers, which is a plus. Thumbs up!",
