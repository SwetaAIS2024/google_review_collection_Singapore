It was ready within 3 minutes because the restaurant was almost empty, with only 2 other customers. The food was okay for the price, and the restaurant was bright and clean. Good value overall.",

Overpriced for soup only.\n\nMaybe meals are better value! 3* for good taste though, if a bigger portion, would gave been 4*, but portion size is seriously mean and miserly. An extra 50% would probably only cost less than an extra dollar to make as it is 80% water, and would make for happy customers. Won't be coming back as value too low, even though the soup is good.",
