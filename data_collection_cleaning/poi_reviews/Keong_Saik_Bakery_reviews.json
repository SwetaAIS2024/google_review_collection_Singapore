      "text": "Another overated cafe found on Google maps. The interior has a modern industrial vibe — spacious and stylish, but it lacks comfortable seating like couches.\n\nThe coffee was priced higher than Starbucks, yet tasted worse than a typical kopitiam brew, maybe the 3 in 1 coffee you made is better.\nThe salmon bagel was overly chewy, not up to standard which was quite disappointing.\n\nOverall, while the environment is pleasant, the quality of food and drinks did not justify the above-average prices.",

      "text": "Decent options for pastries and cakes both sweet and savoury. Unfortunately no loaves happen to be available when we visited.\n\nGood enough matcha latte, not overly matcha pungent for people who cannot do the original legit, but they cannot omit sugar was told premix with sugar.\n\nTried their hotfood some laksa baked cheese mac, i think teenagers will like it. Certainly good enough to keep people looking for some comfort food happy. Nice decor wit array of plastic baked products on display like a museum, good amount of space used up for it but to begin with we didnt see much crowd compared to syip across the mezzazine.",

But we were angry.\n\nWhen the delivery came, there were missing items. OMG!!!\n\nIf you want to be embarrassed and your audience hungry, please be my guest.\n\nI won't recommend.\n\nSometimes, I wondered. Can average quality food give Keong Saik bakery the permission to be arrogant in their service delivery.\n\nWhat a bad before and after taste.",
