Wayne Chai,1,"Before you read on, know that (I didn't know before this) you could have gone to Istar Trading Pte Ltd as an alternative. I have never dealt with or even spoken to Istar before, but nobody can be as bad as Beacon.
Bad customer service is an understatement.
1) Called and asked for a model's avaialbility and this Linda person told me it is available. Drive all the way from the west to their Bedok site, and she told me that no stock.
2) Google listed company open for business on Saturday. Called and again this Linda person said they are open for accounting only, don't bring down pump for repair.
3) Called on Monday to confirm they can look at my pump, and again this Linda person said, ""Monday' of course we are open"", insinuating I am asking the obvious.
4) Brought my pump down, and they simply asked me leave the pump on the floow and my contact number, without even getting off their chair. (see pic below, my pump on the floor)
5) THIS IS THE WORST PART!
Product supposed to warranty for 1 year. They tell me pump motor is spoilt, and thus consider as wear and tear, and it is not under warranty. Again, this Linda person said that it covered only manufacturer defect, and according to her only cover the situation where you are unable to use the pump at all. Does she even understand the word warranty?

I used the pump only for a couple of months, well within the 1 year period, and in accordance to the manufacturer's instruction.
