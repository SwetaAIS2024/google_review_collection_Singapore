Marcus Ang,4,"pork katsu was great, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, nicely elevated with the citrusy sauce.

beef brisket (slices) can be a little tough, fatty parts could be a little more rendered to give a more consistent texture. sweet and sour sauce was an attempt at kimchi flavours, able to cut through the meaty taste.

portions were reasonable for the price paid, will be back to try other items when around the area.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111145722549856734783/reviews
LiJie Ang,5,"If you are craving for sando, this is the place!
The portion is very big! We ordered hoki fish and tonkatsu, and we had half each! I especially like their hoki fish! Must try. Maybe the next time i can try menchi katsu",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112086552760444998839/reviews
Sleepy Sleeping,5,"I ordered one fish and one beef brisket. The fish is really nice and isn't drowned in sauce. I would prefer the beef brisket to be even softer. I find the price reasonable, based on the quality and quantity. The place was clean and comfortable. The service was great, too. Do note that they close at 2:30 p.m., but the last order is at 2 p.m.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109760210623455273641/reviews
HY F,5,"Worth the a visit! Chillax location on a Saturday morning without noisy patrons. Easy parking within ATP itself. Add on a walk at Hort Park (side gate has direct access to ATP).

Warm and friendly service. Reasonable prices compared to other sando places which charge high $20s. Here the sandwiches are net prices and mostly under $17.

We had:
1. Beef brisket - flavorful, enjoyed it lots
2. Hoki fish - fish was over fried to a hard crisp. It was just ok
3. Spam-O - thick slab of spam and hash brown. Can’t go wrong with this combo
4. Flat white, Cappuccino - good cuppas

Breakfast sandos +$3 for a sizeable portion of tater tots.

Will absolutely return again for a chill, tasty and value meal.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112791788110149101774/reviews

🐷 𝐓𝐨𝐧𝐤𝐚𝐭𝐬𝐮 ($16.60): The cutlet was so crispy and the pork was no doubt tender, like how I recalled. Not a fan of the shredded cabbage though, just felt kinda rough to the mouth ??? And each cabbage keep falling out which was annoying, minus 0.5 points for demure eating experience — rating: 3.5/5. ⁣

🥚𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞 𝐓𝐚𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐤𝐢 ($12.80): Part of their all-day breakfast selection — tamagoyaki, truffle sauce, egg salad, coral lettuce. The tamago was perfect in terms of thickness, fluffiness and bite 🤍 However it was too sweet and got jelak even though I only had a half. Could have toned down on the sugar as the bread itself was already sweet — rating: 2.5/5. ⁣",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110086868863323086741/reviews
