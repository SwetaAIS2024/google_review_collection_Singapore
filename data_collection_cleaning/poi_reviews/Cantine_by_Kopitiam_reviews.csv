KKT,3,"Pretty comfortable environment footcourt at the corner of North shore Plaza facing the sea view. Somehow very poor handphone signal inside, need to walk out to get some signal for phone payment modes.

Jap-Korean food generally ok. $6 for kimchi fried rice with an egg. Portion served quite a lot.

Drinks stall choices of cocktail soda at $3.30 each, photo illustration looks concentrated with colour, actual is quite plain. Full cup of ice used for preparation, so pretty diluted. Staff is friendly and serves well, maybe the ratio of syrup guideline needs to be adjusted.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
Jacob TAN,3,"A small foodcourt at NorthShore Ii. Not much food choice here. You can get a view of the sea if you are fortunate to get a table at that end.
Coffee and tea here are acceptable.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
Lu Ruiling,2,"Leaving a review for Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang...
The chicken is not fresh. Frozen chicken is used to cook the food. Normally, frozen chicken does not taste as bad as this.  Tastes floury and disgusting, texture of the chicken is extremely bad as well. Not worth the price.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103485840940633360259/reviews
Lanz Jalal,4,"First time having my meal here. There are a total of 9 stalls here. All stalls are Halal.

Situated by the waterfront, it is a very relaxing and cozy eatery at Northshore Plaza 2.

You can use your Kopitiam card here and pay lesser. Top-up counter available at the entrance.

We had nasi ayam taliwang and nasi Padang with Nutella and Oreo dough. Finish off with special blended coffee and tea with grass jelly.

Both foods taste delicious and fresh. We will come back again to try other stall vendors there.

Below are the stall vendors available:

1. Lau Pa Sat BBQ
2. Fitra Chicken Rice
3. Enak Sedap Nasi Padang
4. Astro Thai/Viet Cuisine
5. Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang
6. Indo Express
7. Fat Baby Rotisserie      Western Cuisine
8. Fat Baby Goes India
9. D'Laksa

The only flaw, in my opinion, is that the tables and chairs are too close. Maybe they need to update the layout with only rectangular tables instead of round ones.

Update: 15/07/2022

Today we went again to try Fat Baby Western. We had Hawaian Pizza, Double Wagyu Beef Burger and Salmon Grilled Filet. The pizza and burger taste great while the salmon is a bit dry but still tasty. Overall this vendor is worth trying if you are feeling adventurous.

Update 01/01/25: Try the Astro Thai stall today.Had the sweet and sour fish and Thai fried rice beef.

Taste: Fair
Price: Moderate
Portion: Not adequate
Verdict: Not recommended",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100866069645097261411/reviews
Nelson Chia,2,"food overall not to standard nor tasty, definitely not worth the money you paid for. the drinks stall is one of the worst, serving special ice blend caramel salted coffee that taste like soya milk.  spend your hard earned money elsewhere",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108291475343900289698/reviews
