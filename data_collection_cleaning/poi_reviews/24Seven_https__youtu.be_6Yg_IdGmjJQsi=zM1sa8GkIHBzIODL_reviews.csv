Ohayo Oreo,5,"10cents per page, very hard to find. I got to get 500+ pages to be printed out and call them before heading down. Yes, they're slow and didn't stick to the time of delivery but the Chinese lady is very friendly and apologetic for the delay. Is a very convenient place to get your documents printed. Just give yourself time to collect it.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115686301019775153408/reviews
