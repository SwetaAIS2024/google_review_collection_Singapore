June Ang,3,"I recently had lunch at Toast Box in VivoCity. As expected, the queue was long and just when it was my turn, the ordering system suddenly broke down. Despite this, the staff handled the situation remarkably well. After about 15 minutes of trying to fix the system, they decided to take orders manually to keep the line moving. I was impressed by how calm, professional and polite the staff remained throughout, even under the pressure of a crowded queue and technical issues.

I ordered two ala carte curry chicken, one with rice and the other with bread. While the curry itself was flavorful, the portion of bread provided was very disappointing. It was a small square toast, cut into 9 cubes, barely enough to dip into the curry. The size not only made it impractical for dipping but left the meal feeling incomplete and not filling. For the price, I expected a more substantial portion that could fully complement the delicious curry.

While the service and professionalism of the staff were commendable, the portion size of the bread with the curry needs improvement.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116720311529529767073/reviews
Randy Ngatimin,4,"Toast Box is a beloved SG cafÃ© chain famous for its traditional breakfast dishes like kaya toast and soft-boiled eggs. Loved the authentic flavors and cozy atmosphere, but prices have been going sky high nowadays. Overall, itâ€™s a great place to get a taste of classic SG breakfast.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107076346774947547605/reviews
Bright Eyes,4,"The coffee is great but the salted tau sa piah is awful. ðŸ‘Œ, to be fair, the fillings are not bad but the pastry is badly done, hard and tasteless to say the least. I think it can be saved by having it toasted to bring out the flavour if any. I finished the fillings leaving only the crustðŸ˜…ðŸ¤£.  Unless they improve the pastry, never order the tau sa piah from hereðŸ˜£.

CNY 2024:  Recently I went for Red Bean Toast Set. Its quite nice. All lovely. Coffee, Red Bean Toast as well as the half boiled eggs.

26 November 2024: was there for breakfast. Had multigrain peanut butter thick toast. Wonderfully toasted with a generous spread of crunchy peanut butter. One of the best toasts amongst the various outlets. Coffee as usual is always great here. Will return for more next time.

21 April 2025: came here this morning for breakfast. Had Cheesy Ham & Egg on Multi grain thick toast. Really yummy, love it so much. Will come again for this.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114200783271279069230/reviews
Terrick W.,3,"Visited Toastbox Vivocity. Space is really limited. Back to back, table to table. Not friendly for family with kids. Food standard wise acceptable. The place is good for quick bites and rest. We ordered peanut toast set. Came with soft boiled eggs and a drink.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117988793492560252192/reviews
Jonathan Tan,1,"The 3 staffs showed in the photo are rather rude and no customer service especially the cashier (short guy with white hat) is really rude. Keep hashing people to place orders and donâ€™t even wait for few second for me to choose my drink. Also I ordered the laksa and it should be come with white thick bihun, but they changed it to mee tai Mak without even telling me or ask if is okay for me! Really disappointed and bad attitude by most of the staff. When asked them, they even reply in a very rude and disrespectful way! Wonâ€™t come back again and hope the management can see the problem that might affect the company business! The seats near the kitchen are stink like hell!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110126654010294772889/reviews
