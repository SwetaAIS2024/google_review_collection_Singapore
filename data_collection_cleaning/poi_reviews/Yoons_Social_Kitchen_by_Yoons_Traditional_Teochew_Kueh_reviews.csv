Woon Peng Ziady,5,"Loved the Mee siam, Hokkien prawn mee and Thai omelette among other scrumptious dishes.

Unassuming location in an HDB estate with ample parking...come mingle with the locals.

Beautifully decorations that speak of tradition, history with splashes of joyful colours.

Love the concept of preserving traditional Teochew kueh and craftmanship, plus the social enterprise angle. What's not to love?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112133209036035355760/reviews
Clifford Yeo,3,"This area has ample parking spaces. Very convenient for those who drive and for people living there.

Tried their curry chix set to find it tasteless. The potato was hard and quite uncooked and the chap chye was too slimy!

The koo chye kueh is probably the best among the different kuehs. The rice kueh is just salty and it doesn't really give me the satisfaction. Sadly, I feel thirsty after that. Certainly there are many better and more authentic ones elsewhere.

It is a nice place to relax over toast bread, egg and tea.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112710052515501603525/reviews
Roxanne Tan,5,"I went in a group to this quaint cafe not knowing what I was getting into. Upon entering the cafe, I was delighted to find old school nostalgic decorations that took me back to many decades before. It helped they have aircon on a hot afternoon. They served many types of hot and cold drinks, toast and their signature Teochew kuehs. On top of that, you can order hot food such as mee siam, lontong, curry chicken and more. And not to mention some local desserts. We ordered mee siam, lontong, curry chicken, soy sauce chicken wings and fried prawn noodles to share.  I like the mee siam, fried prawn noodle and soy sauce chicken wings.  The food paired well with the homemade lemongrass drink that you can order hot or cold and sugar or no sugar.  Last but not least, I had some Teochew kueh to go. The angkoo is really good. I also had a chance to try their soon kueh made from real bamboo shoots!!! It's delicious! Definitely be back again,  if I'm around the vicinity!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102051490783428561411/reviews
Christine Lee,4,This is a social enterprise worth supporting. I had a delicious mee siam for breakfast followed by a traditional Teochew kueh and coffee. Senior citizens get 20% of the bill.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117063691860800114256/reviews
