Aik Tian Loo,5,"I was treated by Dr Prem Pillay for my fractured spine after a fall.  He explained the various options of treatment in detail and he was so patient with me.  I was initially hesitant to proceed with the treatment, but finally went through as I was in great pain.  I made the right decision as my spine has recovered and I am now pain free.
I'm very happy and satisfied to be under his care. Kudos to Dr Prem Pillay and his team.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108700937415690280825/reviews
