As a non-native speaker, mastering pronunciation and tones was particularly challenging for me, but Marina Laoshi was exceptionally patient and dedicated. She ensured that we grasped the basics thoroughly, creating a supportive environment that greatly enhanced our learning process. We got to show off our rudimentary mandarin while ordering food during our term end class dinner.",

The additional tips for conversational chinese specific to Singapore context are quite helpful. Very happy to have found ELN and to complete the Conversational Chinese Term 1 classes. Hope to join the next set of classes soon.",

The classes aren't just about reading a passage in the given textbook and as the classes aren't as packed the teachers can help students on a more personal level. From my experiences with 老师 Cruyff and Weina I can proudly say that my mandarin skills have noticeably improved.",
