I had requested and paid for an additional serving of noodles, but it was not provided. I have attached photos for your reference, one with added noodles and one without. Both look the same right?\n\nAdditionally, the soup served was barely one-third full, which was far below expectations.\n\nThis experience was truly disappointing, and I urge others not to patronize the store.",

Dry version too much sauce in my opinion, but I guess that makes it tasty.\n\nOnly complain is prawn is sliced into half, which really affect the ‚Äòbite feel‚Äô; and it doesn‚Äôt make de-shelling any easier.\n\nThe pig stomach is tender. Hope to try the intestines next time, if I still have remaining CDC vouchers to use üòâ",

I ordered the prawn noodles without ribs version - thinking of leaving some room for curry puffs.\n\nFirst impression was great. There were 1 and a half prawns of decent size in the noodles, the fishcake slices looked gourmet and there were also pork lard (shout-out to the fans) and fried onions in the soup.\n\nThe soup tastes decently good, it is not as rich as those other branded prawn noodles, which threaten to clog up your arteries or cause a gout flare-up rightaway, and not as thin as your primary school canteen's prawn mee stall.\n\nThe fish cake was really good, there is not a tinge of fishiness when I ate it. You can tell they use quality, fresh ingredients.\n\nPork lard was crispy and prawns were fresh so I managed to peel them off the shells with the chopsticks and my teeth.\n\nAs for service, auntie didn't smile and didn't look too friendly, I think need to warn up more üòÇ\n\nOverall it's value for money at $4.90 and offers a great pawn noodles fix if you are nearby.",

She did not hear my order not to have chilli. When I reminded her, she raised her voice and reprimand me for not telling early(which I did).\n\nAfter all that fuss & embarrassment, I was still given 2 bowls of spicy chilli noodles. The food was wasted as I never take chilli noodles. Paid $15 for 2 bowls. Will you go there??\n\nDon't understand why people are so unhappy earning a living. We treat them with all the respect, but received such idiotic treatment for patronising...\n\nThere were many similar complaints before... I guess the company wouldn't care less.",
