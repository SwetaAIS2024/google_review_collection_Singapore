GoAheadGroupFan,5,"On Friday 15 November 2024, I had prawn scrambled egg rice and spicy popcorn chicken for my lunch at Keat Hong Food Centre & Market outlet within Keat Hong Shopping Centre at Choa Chu Kang, and the prawn scrambled egg rice and spicy popcorn chicken tasted very delicious as I liked this meal. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these other delightful scrambled egg rice dishes (except Beef and Pork) from other Egg Talk outlets in the future.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105877449322822053371/reviews
