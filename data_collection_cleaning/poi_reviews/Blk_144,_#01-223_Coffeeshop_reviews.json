      "text": "Very nice Lor Mee in CCK area. The braised pork belly is very fragrant and tender. The portion of the sliced ngor hiang given was quite big. To me, the most important part of Lor Mee is the Lor. The Lor is very thick and fragrant. I was abit skeptical at first because it looks lighter in colour compared to others. But I was wrong, it's highly fragrant esp after they put the garlic and black vinegar!\n\nIn my opinion, they win Tian Fa noodle house hands down.",

As for curry mee, it is too milky n thick. However, it would be nice to add some steam chicken to enhance the flavor as curry mee.\nFor the price n quantity, no one should complain.",
