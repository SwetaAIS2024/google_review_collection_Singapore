Raj Kumar,1,"Never see such doctor in my whole life, see doctor for my neck and back pain.
Waiting for 3 hours to see doctor and doctor check me lesser than 30 seconds.
Just ask me wat problem,I replied.
Doctor said wait outside to collect your medicine.
He never check my bp, never check wat is the cause for pain whether muscle strain or anything else.
Wasted money and my good time.
