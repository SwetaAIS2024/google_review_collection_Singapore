Shah,5,"I recently visited Tanamera Coffee Indonesia and tried their Matcha Latte with soy milk, and I must say, it was a delightful experience! The matcha latte had a light, subtle flavor, but it was perfectly balanced and incredibly satisfying. I loved how it wasn't overly sweet. It’s definitely one of the best matcha lattes I’ve had in a while!

What made my visit even more enjoyable was the amazing staff. He was warm, welcoming, and attentive, ensuring that everything was just right. His friendly demeanor truly elevated the overall experience.

Tanamera Coffee is definitely a place I’d recommend for both a great drink and exceptional service. Can’t wait to visit again!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103309695879531421809/reviews
