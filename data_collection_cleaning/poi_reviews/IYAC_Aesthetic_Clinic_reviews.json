      "text": "Dr Yeoh is wonderful. I have encountered bad facial therapists in my younger days which caused me skin sensitivities and left some imperfections on my otherwise clear and healthy complexion. Yet thanks much to Dr Yeoh who helped me rebuild a healthier skin. It is really important to engage a full fledged professional and experienced aesthetic doctor like Dr Yeoh, who really wants you to have good healthy skin! She has saved my complexion on several occasions when I had bad acne and on the verge of scarring. Moreover, IYAC‚Äôs skincare products and facial therapies are effective and very comfortable on the skin. Oh, and Dr Yeoh is really gorgeous, elegant and attentive, you just feel so at ease with her as your doctor. ü§©",

Impressed by her results, she recommended Dr. Yeoh to me, and\nI‚Äôve been seeing her for almost three years now. What I love most about Dr. Yeoh is her honest and personalized approach‚Äîshe only recommends treatments that truly suit my needs, never pushing unnecessary products or procedures. On top of that, her exceptional skills are worth highlighting. After every session, I leave feeling rejuvenated and noticeably more youthful.",
