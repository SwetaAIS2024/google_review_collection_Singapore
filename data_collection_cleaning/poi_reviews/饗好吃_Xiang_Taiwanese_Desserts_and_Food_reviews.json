The salted fried chicken was crispy and tender. But there was a slight sweet taste inside. Service was friendly. Food was served promptly except the fried chicken noodle which took slightly longer. Ambience was a bit noisy but still cooling on a hot day.",

I passed around the table giving the disclaimer. 5 of them were very sad also.\n\nGood:\n- Grilled Teriyaki Chicken was very nice to me. Very well marinated. Topped with Teriyaki Sauce.\n- Nett price\n- Chilli at the sauce corner was very nice\n- Atmosphere on weekday lunch was nice. Not too crowded.",

Overall a very authentic Taiwanese place  with great service but food needs to improve a little taste wise. It’s not bad but it’s not so good that I would go right back or think about it.",
