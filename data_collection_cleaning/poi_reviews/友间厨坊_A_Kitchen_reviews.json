I tried to ask their manager about it and what she told me is that i shouldn't trust the photo on their menu. OK.\n\nI recommend you to go outside and buy a bowl of $5 oysters meesua, all the oysters in the meesua confirmed bigger than this for many many times. Dun waste money on this.",

Pork and mutton good. Chicken soso (won't order again)\nDo note for takeaway, the metal skewers are removed.\n\nThe 拍黄瓜 cucumber wasn't as nice as  the usuals that I had.\n\nWill try other dishes again!",
