      "text": "Chestnut Nature Park is Singapore‚Äôs largest nature park, spanning 81 hectares and offering a serene escape into nature. It‚Äôs a great option for a light hike, especially for beginners or casual walkers looking for an easy, refreshing trail.\n\nThe northern loop is a straightforward 1.7km route that takes just over 30 minutes, with gentle terrain and clear signage throughout. Along the way, you‚Äôll find a couple of huts for shelter, small bridges, and a quiet stream ‚Äî simple highlights that add charm to the walk. I‚Äôd rate it a 4 out of 5 ‚Äî accessible, peaceful, and a welcome retreat from the city.",

      "text": "Another pleasant morning hike at Chestnut Nature Park via Zhenghua Nature Park, started from Hillview.\n\nGreeted by a squirrel shortly after our hike at the very beginning (lovely)! Then, it started drizzling‚Ä¶fortunately, just a passing cloud. Well, on & off over the 2-hour hike. Overall, a pleasant hike despite the humidity.\n\nApparently, quite a few wild roosters/hens spotted along the hike on this trail. I kinda like this nature trails üëç üëç",

      "text": "We were at Chestnut Nature Park on three occasions.\n\nOn the first occasion, we were at the inner section of the Northern Hiking Loop, and we noticed that this hiking trail was relatively more rugged compared to many other trails in Singapore. We decided to go to the Northern Loop because the Southern Loop was partially closed.\n\nOn the second occasion, we were at the Southern Hiking Loop to train to hike on rugged terrain using our recently purchased hiking sticks. We saw some weird-looking fungi along the way. The Southern Loop was still partially closed then.\n\nOn the third occasion, we were at the outer section of the Northern Hiking Loop to continue our training on rugged terrain, routing back to Chestnut Nature Park car park via Zhenghua Park. Highlights of this route included the Observation Tower and an old bridge in the vicinity of Zhenghua Park. We also spotted a small deer along the way. The small deer was probably a mouse deer.",

But the trees with the 'globe balls' in the southern one were very interesting!\nGot to see a wild boar family in the northern one, safely in the distance.\nI enjoyed the view from the tower, too.",
