The soup broth is very flavorful and thick. The gentleman that runs the place (I assume owner) was so kind and gracious, even delivered my soup to my table and thanked me for my patronage. I'll most certainly be a regular at his stall.",

      "text": "4/5 star: $15\nLamb shank briyani\nThe moment the steaming plate of biryani is set down, it is clear that this isn’t just a meal; it’s an experience. Aromatic basmati rice, infused with a symphony of spices, forms the bed for the star of the show—a succulent lamb shank that practically melts off the bone. The lamb is marinated with a blend of traditional spices and slow-cooked to perfection, ensuring each bite is both tender and flavourful.\n\nThe layers of rice and lamb are punctuated with bursts of saffron and caramelized onions, adding a depth of flavour that is both complex and incredibly satisfying. The careful balance of spices, from the earthiness of the cumin to the heat of the chilies, ensures that no single note overwhelms the palate. Instead, they work in harmony to create a dish that is as nuanced as it is indulgent.",

      "text": "Bakarath Mutton Soup, a solid gem in Adam Road Hawker Centre, serves up a comforting bowl of mutton soup that's rich on the spices and flavour. The flavorful mutton broth is the star, simmered for hours with a blend of spices that gives it depth without overpowering the tender chunks of mutton perfumed with shallots.\nThe mutton meat soup at $7, comes with an option of rice or bread for an added dollar, perfect for soaking up the savory liquid. The stall draws a loyal following of adventurous foodies. While the wait can be long during peak hours, the hearty and satisfying soup makes it a standout option for those craving authentic flavors. It's an excellent choice for a warming meal, especially on cooler days.",

      "text": "A very DISAPPOINTING experience overall! The kambing (mutton) leg soup came with only bones with NO meat! I took it back to the stall owner. His response was “You must tell me you want meat!” The next bowl was completely lukewarm! The quality and taste didn’t meet up to expectations either. The stall owner also didn’t have the ethics to return us the difference in price between the mutton leg soup and the mutton meat soup. The Michelin Gormand title should be removed from this vendor. Beware before visiting this stall.",
