      "text": "The salted egg pasta was disappointing.  Nothing close to what was mentioned in the menu. The chicken was not fresh and it was not crispy chicken. There was no chili padi at all and it was so watery.  The turkey bacon cabonara was also so watery with hardly any turkey bacon. The food quality has dropped tremendously over time. It's a shame that they cannot maintain the standards.",

Some good items such as Penny with Crispy Chicken, Chilly Crab Pasta are no longer available. Choices are lesser and no longer economical as before.\n\n1) Chicken Chop is dry and hard, fries were cold.\n2) Fish and Chips portion shrink\n3) Truffle Mushroom paste creamy and good taste\n4) Bacon Penny was good too",
