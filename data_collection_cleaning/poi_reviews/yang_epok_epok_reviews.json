Today, I realised the stall had some changes and the price increased to $1 per puff, the epok had changes too. The pastry was completely different. I would happily pay to have the old epok epok (one tt was hand pressed by auntie). This current pastry spoils the entire experience. Fillings were still generous and flavourful though.",

The new generation of owners should honour the legacy of the old. There is a reason why the puffs were nice when it was handmade.",

Despite the size and price changed (not so important for a foodie), it's the taste that is totally gone.\nI guess those regulars will understand what I meant.\nI won't say the puffs now doesn't taste good, it could be your flavour. And I may also patron for snacking if there's no comparison.\nTruthfully hope that the old taste can come back soon.",

Flaky, crunchy yet feeling light in the mouth. The fillings were reasonably filled too. Both potato & sardine options were well-marinated & tasted awesome ðŸ¤¤ Oh did I mention it costs only 60cents/piece? Bang for buck definitely.",
