      "text": "Latest update  as of 18 Oct 2024. They no longer entertain walk-in. Need to email them first and get an appointment.\n\nJust like many drivers, I am one of those who have opted to have my VEP tag posted. It was a waiting game. After some research, I decided to pop by here to self-collect the tag.\n\nIt is not their fault for unable to deliver your tags. They just have way too much tags to handle and I witnessed this myself. Yes, we paid for it but don‚Äôt fault the salary staff.\n\nMy advice:\n1. Email them your Consignment Number (15 digit) and perhaps, identify yourself.\n2. They will search and prepare in advance, so that you can collect it immediately when u are there (I saw someone came, collected and left immediately).\n3. For those collecting on behalf of your friend, do prepare a simple letter of authorisation.\n4. You can choose to walk-in, but you will probably need to wait for 10 to 30mins for them to search for it (it is a function of people going there to collect & where is ur parcel at that point of time).\n5. Be nice to them & treat them with respect. Trying screaming at them and I doubt they can locate your tag ü§≠\n\nNote: They do have a small no-frills air-con room for you to wait.",

I went to collect the VEP parcel as suggested by the Citylink Express CS on whatsapp. If you also find the VEP has arrived the SG facility but no further updates, just walk in to their office. No need to call them as the phone has no one to attend to. The CS team is nice, took them 10 mins to find my parcel. However as a business, it seems they are not up to the task.",

According to vepams website‚Äôs tracking status, my package landed in Singapore on 5 September. Nothing delivered to my house. So, on 19 Sep, I made a trip to CityLink office in Toa Payoh.
