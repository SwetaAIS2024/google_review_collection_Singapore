Gekie T,5,"My boy is 5yo and attending Zee PH since he was 18mth and it is the best decisions ever we made for him.

My boy is special need n we search thru the SGEnable list of Inclusive sch and none fit the criterias we wanted. It was very tiring having to shuffle btw SPD and CC during his early days n glad that we found Zee, which is a childcare  that have in-house therapy so that it is a one stop shop.

Zee was the only inclusive sch in whole SG that accepted my boy who require additional support like an infant.
The founder also have foresight to hire ex-nurse as the Teacher and assistant who are able to cater to the additional support of my son. The Teacher n student ratio is also kept lower than usual CC to ensure sufficient attention on all students.
The Teachers are also professional, loving and caring. They really shower alot of care for the students and my boy have thrive so much since he joined. He enjoyed going to sch and his social has improved so much w the interactions w his classmates and Teachers. Very thankful to the teacher are so loving and patient.

There is very little info n feedback on the sch when I was searching 3Y ago, there was only 1-2 short positive review of the sch in some forums. So glad we took the leap of faith n enroll our boy in the sch.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110128304038796943564/reviews
