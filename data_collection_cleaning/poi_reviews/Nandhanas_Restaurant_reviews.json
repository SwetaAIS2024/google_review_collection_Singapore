      "text": "As we stepped into the restaurant, a sense of quiet calm filled the air, with only a few tables occupied. Our order soon followed: fragrant briyani, warm naan, crispy dosai, and rich butter chicken, each dish a delightful symphony of spices. Even the accompanying dipping sauces showcased a remarkable attention to detail. To complement our meal, we enjoyed refreshing lassi, and even ordered some to take away. The perfect ending came in the form of a sweet and delicate Rasamalai. Every bite was a pleasure, leaving us with no regrets and a definite desire to return.",

I have tried other branches, but the HQ Joo Koon is by far the best. Manager Mr. Nathel is also friendly. I strongly recommend you to try the delicious naan.",

      "text": "Amazing experience is assured anyone who steps into Nandhana‚Äôs Restaurant in Joo Khoon. It was early morning rush hour last Wednesday and almost all stalls people queued up to buy their breakfast and I happened see this new restaurant Nandhana‚Äôs aptly playing devotional music to infuse serene atmosphere at 7:15 AM in the morning. There were only two staffs and I was concerned whether I can get my food on time. To my surprise the staff Saravanan was in kitchen making Thosai , Parata, Chapati and idly made wonders in minutes with his magical fingers. The staff Pradeep managed counter shuttled rapidly to collect food and delivered to table. These two young men clearly demonstrated the high performance team culture to help each others to give best for customers. I visited again on following day morning had sumptuous feast. Idly was soft , Ghee Thosai and three chutney are outstanding. My son bought Chapathi for his lunch. The chef gave 3 curries and their fish curry is hall mark signature dish. The South Indian meals during lunch is real value for money with unique curries like tapioca fry. My mornings are blissful and I feel energetic to rush to Joo Khoon Nandhana‚Äôs as if the sun is rising in west :) Great Food , Excellent Service the best experience. Tasty breakfast at rapid pace to meet the needs of office employees around Joo Khoon area and sumptuous meals to relax and unwind in the evening hours. Great Food , Gracious people, Good hospitality.",
