      "text": "Previously sent my infant daughter in as I've heard alot of great things about this ctr. Long wait list and extremely popular  among parents = good right? I'm sorely disappointed. We were on the wait list before I gave birth and she went in when she's around 6 mth old. The ctr is running at full capacity and at times I'm not sure if the teachers are able to cope or stretching at their max. First - My daughter 's bum constantly red from rash - most likely from delayed diaper change and no, she don't have delicates sensitive skin. Second - she's constantly having runs and I could see intact corns and brown rice in her waste. Ctr continued to feed her such items even after I expressed concern over the suitability as she's only 8 mth old. Even a fellow mummy said the same thing about her infant son, who's also at the Centre. During pick up, at times we will glance at her through the viewing glass. She will be sitting down and stoning. No evening activities or toys to engage her. Alot more issues which I will not go into details. We pulled her out of the Centre as their in charge are not keen to further engage us, but I would like to give thank to their admin support staff ms Joyce - she's super nice and helpful. Can't say the same about the rest. My ger right now is very happy and thriving at another Centre - mxxxxbear. One will not know the difference unless comparisons n are being made. Feel free to reach out to me if you wish to know more.\n\nYap",
