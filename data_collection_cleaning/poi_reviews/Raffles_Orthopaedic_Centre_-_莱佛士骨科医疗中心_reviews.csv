Jennifer C.,5,"I would like to thank all the staff at Raffles Orthopaedic Centre. They are all so professional and patient. Even when the crowd gets overwhelming, they still treat every patient with a smile.
My Orthopaedic Doctor Tan Ken Jin further adds on to the wonderful experience at Raffles Orthopaedic. He listens to your every concern and made you feel heard.
He addresses them with professionalism and doesn't make you feel rushed.

Emonda Wong,1,"Cancelled my appointment without prior notice, said that they attempted to call me but when i called back multiple times within the same day, no one answered. Only reached out to me via whatsapp/email to ask if i can come TODAY instead. No apology was made either. Super unprofessional.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112973885929626544084/reviews
Joey Tan,1,"I was scheduled for an orthopaedic specialist appointment here due to my plantar fasciitis and I was only 5-10 minutes late upon reaching the clinic but the receptionist very rudely told me that since I‚Äôm late (for 5-10 mins), the doctor has already left since he has a surgery later. I was shocked and asked why didn‚Äôt they call to inform me, because I took time off from work to specially head down to Bugis (I stay at the west) for the appointment. The receptionist replied ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt call us to inform that you‚Äôre late‚Äù. Really extremely horrible service and they don‚Äôt seem the least bit apologetic at all. writing this review in hopes that people can save their time and money and go to another specialist instead.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108527501870769322768/reviews

eunice seow,1,"Very Bad experience! I was told my MRI appointment was 4.30pm and I arrived at 4.05pm to make payment for my MRI. I was then asked to go to level 1. I waited at Clinic for 50mins and when approached the counter then I was told tat my scan was actually scheduled for 5.20pm instead. My sms message reminder indicated that it was 4.45pm. The nurse at L12 Michelle, didn‚Äôt even mention the MRI time when I was there early to make payment. So I asked for a refund, and the other nurse there, Aileen was very rude! I asked for a copy of the receipt that I had originally paid for. She say she cannot give me a copy as it was void. I only wanted a photocopy for cross reference in case my card was still charged. She juz threw the copy on the table in front of me and said ‚Äúyou can take this!‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt give a single star here if not for the fact that it was mandatory!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100703630260601281416/reviews
