And the other dishes we tried were just sumptuous. The pictures of the food speak for themselves. Desserts were a delight. Near Buona Vista mrt and walkable from One North too. A real gem.",

My friend got the baked rice which was flavourful and the portion size was generous. The drinks were quite good and cute! Desserts had the right amount of sweetness, and overall were new and interesting things that I haven‚Äôt tried before",

Not that much sitting space, and until they get things nailed down I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this for lunch if you‚Äôre in a rush. Great if you want to chillax a bit, they have a selection of pretty looking desserts that you can get as a set for with a main.\n\nUpdate: Very friendly staff, and they have definitely gotten things running more smoothly now. Food is great and amazing quality, definitely worth a visit.",

Enjoyed a surprise complimentary baked donut with lotus paste filling. Love the experience and will be back again soon. Muslim friendly.",
