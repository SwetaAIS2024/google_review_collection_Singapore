Tung Felicia,1,"Got ignored by all the receptionists even though I was standing and waiting at the counter. They actually treat you like you‚Äôre transparent, and look right past you. They don‚Äôt even see you nor acknowledge your existence, much less say a word to you.

The reviews here are accurate.
All I wanted was to top up my standard pills before I travel. Easy, would‚Äôve only taken 5 mins.

After having no one speak to me still, I turned right around and went to Union Clinic, located right next door, where I experienced professionalism from the staff there.

Please, no need to copy and paste the same old formal ‚Äúwe will investigate‚Äù reply here. I can see the same reviews have been made about the same issues, dating back from 7 years ago till today.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104009598628268372040/reviews

Shalu Devi,1,"3 receptionist on duty but all 3 ignored me for about 3-5mins while I was waiting at the counter to register my name. Moreover, they are very unclear in their instructions (eg. A lady placed a document on the counter for me to fill up without explaining the purpose of the documents etc). It was an unpleasant visit.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106097660871750764036/reviews
