      "text": "The Gong Bao Frog Porridge has the perfect balance of flavors, with tender frog meat infused with a rich, savory sauce that pairs beautifully with the warm, silky porridge. The BBQ squid is one of the best I have ever tasted—grilled to perfection with a smoky char and a delightful chewiness. The sambal stingray is equally impressive, with its fresh, flaky texture and a spicy, aromatic sambal sauce that enhances every bite. Each dish is packed with bold, authentic flavors that make for an unforgettable dining experience. I highly recommend trying them for a truly satisfying meal.",

I asked the stall if the cook was new because it was so blend but the stall keeper went on a defensive saying everyone is the same and implied the dish is the same. My family agreed that the stall owner should at least address my complain instead of defending themselves.   Honestly, to lose a long time customer, the blend taste holds only 10% of our decision not to come back, the rest of the 90% is because of their attitude.",
