Thanh Nguyen,4,"Dry spicy hotpot at Tong Dim Noodle Bar ( inside the casino) is convenient. Authentic fiery flavor, not suited for foreign taste buds.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111138806982654495414/reviews
Toms Arackal,5,"There is usually a wait to get the table since it is inside the casino, but they promptly get your number and you get a SMS 5 mins before your table is available.

The service is quick and staff are always there to take care of your requests.

The food is fresh and delicious. I have had multiple dishes from there, and it has been tasty every single time. You have a wide variety of dishes, including vegetarian and drinks. A good place to visit for food if you are inside the casino.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109174572461887496017/reviews
Albert Xan,4,"- Located inside of the Marina Bay Sands Casino.
- Waiting time here during peak hour can be quite long. It takes me around 30 minutes to wait for 6 people to be seated.

Haven't been here for almost 2 years.
As I said before. This stall is inside the casino...
Means if you are a Singaporean. You need to pay $150,just to get in.
I find the food here OK. A lot better than sentosa casino. As a matter of fact.
The chef has monthly special dishes...
The noodles are hand made..
And Q.
And well.. If u gamble enough..
The meal might be free..
And I seriously think all the crew are amazingly trained...
Imagine..
Customers who lost a lot of money... Pisssd and angry...
Ang Mo drunked...
And also customers who are tourists...
Who think they are very atas..
These are the customers they have to face everyday....
And they are truly amazing to keep their cool everyday.

This restaurant is inside the casino...
I would say the food is not bad.
Compare to minus 1star sentosa casino.
Where u que up like prisoners.
Here u have service and the crews are always quick and courteous.
They have the mthly special.... Which is cheap also.
If u gamble. Still got discount.
Sometimes.... I even just pay the levy to just come and eat and enjoy the quiet here.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110320616002639875710/reviews
