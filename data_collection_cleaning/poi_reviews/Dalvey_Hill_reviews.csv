Forest BK,5,"This IG-worthy location is situated along Dalvey Road.
The elegant European-looking grand Mansion at the top of the hill let it seems like out of Singapore location.
Very nice location for a memorial photo shoot.
Note: there is no proper car park. Take public transport. Nearest mrt is Stevens (blue line) or Napier (brown line); and walk for about 15 to 20 mins.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
