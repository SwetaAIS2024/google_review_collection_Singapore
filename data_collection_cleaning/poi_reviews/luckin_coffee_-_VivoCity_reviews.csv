C,4,"Luckin Coffee at VivoCity is a new outlet of the fast-growing Chinese coffee chain, known for its tech-driven approach and wallet-friendly pricing. The setup is small but well-designed, with a clean, contemporary look that caters mainly to takeaway customers rather than those looking to linger.

I picked up their signature Little Butter Latte — a unique, slightly savoury brew that turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable. There was also an opening promo with the first app order at just $0.99, which made the deal even sweeter. I’d rate it a 4 out of 5 — efficient, modern, and a solid, cheaper alternative to Starbucks if you’re after a quick caffeine fix on the go.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
Gator,4,"A pretty small kiosk with only two to three tables inside the cafe. It’s meant to be a grab and go coffee joint thus the number of tables is expected. As usual, ordered the coffee using the app and selecting the store at vivo city. Had the gesha Americano and the coffee was a strong one. After ordering, received my order with 5 minutes which was very efficient. A new store thus there was some promotions going on as well.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
Jaren Koh,4,"Ordered on the Luckin Coffee app. Only worth it to purchase if you have 60% off and above vouchers. My drink took around 5min. Fast as usual.

Thought they should improve the store interior and sitting to match like luckin coffee China’s beautiful interior.

Happy that Luckin Coffee opened one outlet here as used to go to Harbourfront Tower 1 (office building) to buy luckin coffee. (That outlet is used to cater office ppl)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105920623539818036234/reviews
Benjamin Park,5,"The google maps position is inaccurate. To find this place, go to timezone, swensons area. It is between playmade and 4 fingers. Not bad outlet as usual coffee is great and worth getting if you’re near",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117599988314464672388/reviews
kookiemonster,1,"Came here when it was newly opened and remember not seeing any menu. Asked the counter if they had anything other than strong coffee but.. lets just say English isn't their strong suit. They shook their head not understanding us and we had to walk away disappointed because their grape crush from another location was bomb.

(We asked if there was anything other than coffee because this was our second outlet and don't know if all outlets sell the same menu)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117395817691240957545/reviews
