Yordan Yit,5,"Tucked away in retro Katong Shopping Centre, About Coffee Co. is a cozy, minimalist spot with warm vibes and friendly, knowledgeable staff. Great for specialty coffee lovers — the white (iced) was unique and full of flavor.

The café has a clean, Scandi-inspired look and a calm atmosphere, perfect for a quiet sit-down. Note: it’s cash or PayNow only, which might be inconvenient for some.

Tried the hot white too — decent latte art, but without ice it leaned towards a darker roast. Worth a visit, especially if you’re nearby for chicken rice, banana pie, or laksa.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111794790666094275154/reviews
alfe kim,5,"Finally checked this out

long black using house beans smelled nutty

First sip, generally fruity, but not overly sour. Its good. Some floral notes too

Will be back to try some of the other beans.

Place has a nice ambience being a corner unit of level 2, full glass and overlooking shrubbery.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113733661298781962110/reviews

SM Ching,5,"Loved the kyoho fields pour over, both iced and hot! Very unique, and really with kyoho grapes notes. Felt that the notes were more pronounced in the iced (+$1) version though.

The space is cozy & clean, nice vibes to sit and enjoy your coffee. Love that it’s at Katong mall bc you can eat the KTMW chicken rice, dona manis/ auntie peng banana pie, or 328 laksa nearby. Have been here twice and will be back!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112059817937957164065/reviews
