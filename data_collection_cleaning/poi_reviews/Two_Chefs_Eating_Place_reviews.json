We order their signature milk powder pork ribs, prawn paste chicken, seafood tofu and kai lang. Food is serve within 5 mins. The taste for the milk powder pork ribs is unique and nice. But the meat is a bit hard. There is no special chilli sauce for the prawn paste chicken. The seafood tofu and kai lang taste normal. Don't feel any special on their food. Price is resonable. They accept CASH only. No cards payment. Ample parking available. Beside is the wet market,  inside have posb ATM machine and toilet.",

One of the better Zi chars around. Try the pork ribs and fried prawn paste chicken wings. The fried rice also tasted great!\n\nI would recommend this place. Thumbs up!",

No complaints on the fish and sauce.. but the vegetables inside like the lady finger, brinjal and long bean is totally tasteless and hard. Order HK kailan also price i think $14. Taste is ok but also on the high side to be honest. 2 bottles of water chestnut and luohan guo costs $5.. it's totally a rip off and scam. Suggest go the other opposite Zi char better. This place is Overhyped!!!",
