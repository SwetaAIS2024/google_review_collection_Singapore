      "text": "If you are working in CBD and looking for a place to chill with your co-workers or friends after work, Taki bar is a great option. Set against a backdrop of Torii gates which momentarily transport you to Japan, it is an Izakaya üèÆ which serves affordable Japanese fare like donburi and maki rolls. We tried their Kaisen Don, Bara Chirashi Don, Dragon üêâ maki roll which contained prawn tempura (not dragon meat üòÇ) with a topping of sliced avocado and salmon sashimi, and Tori Nanban. I personally liked their dragon roll the best out of the dishes we ordered. If you are dropping by for lunch, go for their value lunch sets at $19.80++ and on Fridays, you get a complimentary upgrade worth $6 and a FREE beer or Happy Hour drink!",
