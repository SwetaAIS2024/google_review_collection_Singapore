Callie Ho,5,"I recently had lunch at Pietro Ristorante Italiano, and it was a genuinely enjoyable experience from start to finish. We had Pizza Margherita, Ravioli Al Tartufo, Spaghetti Alla Carbonara as well as a Pistachio Tiramisu as a birthday cake. The food was everything you'd hope for in a good Italian restaurant—fresh ingredients, rich flavors, and beautifully plated. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauces were full-bodied, and the tiramisu? Simply divine.
The ambience struck the perfect balance between cozy and vibrant, with warm lighting, tasteful decor, and just enough background music to create atmosphere without overwhelming conversation. It felt welcoming, authentic, and relaxed—ideal for both date nights and casual dinners with friends.
What stood out most, though, was the staff. They were attentive and genuinely engaging with guests. It added a warm, personal touch that made the afternoon feel special rather than routine.
All in all, Pietro Ristorante Italiano is a gem worth revisiting. Great food, great vibe, and a team that makes you feel like you're part of the family.
Just remember to reserve your table before heading down as it can get really crowded.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100418708660949931901/reviews
Marcus Ang,4,"pasta were all cooked al-dente. aglio olio was packed with garlic and chilli fragrance, seafood were fresh and nicely cooked. carbonara, instead of having a creamy coating, was the usual cream-soup you get from other diners

lasagna was well made, with even pasta and minced meat layers, sauce was not overly sour, pairs well.

pizza was thin crusted, generous with ingredients.

the 1-for-1 lunch was a good deal, would be back when in the area.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111145722549856734783/reviews
Lionel Tan,5,This place is popular and hence it is best to make a booking. The highlight was the lasagna and also the lamb shank. The desserts recommended are the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake. Service was prompt and constantly refilled your water which was great. The price for the dishes are reasonable. They also allow you to spin a wheel for bills above $100 to win some small prizes.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105174264645946437106/reviews
Dennis Teo,5,Came because of the 1 for 1 lunch promotion. Really worth it. Most of the items on menu are available. Pizza was good. So was the duck confit and calamari. Wine was good too. Definitely a must visit even without the one for one offer,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107054927604244602176/reviews
Diana Plent,2,"Service was attentive but couldn't make up for the disappointing meal. The pork belly was nothing like I remembered. It used to be my favourite dish at Pietro but the one that I had today was stale, tough and tasteless. I only ate 1.5 pieces of meat (less the fats) and the accompanying veggies. Couldn't force myself to consume the rest as the stale taste put me off. Definitely not worth $28.90.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114943205192358128403/reviews
