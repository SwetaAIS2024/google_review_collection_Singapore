      "text": "It's a scam... The ushers at the entrance are very arrogant, talk to you as if they want to beat you up!\n\nI bought a voucher on Grab and the terms and condition only stated that the voucher should be redeemed on either Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. I went on a Saturday night, and showed them that I was there to redeem my voucher. The staff at the entrance told me I couldn‚Äôt use it because they had a special guest that night and wanted to 'avoid losses.'\n\nWhen I asked which terms and conditions could prevent me from entering because of the presence of special guests, they told me it's their decision now and they would inform Grab partnership team next time. It becomes my own problem and I should deal with Grab myself instead!\n\nInterestingly, the staff then admitted that the voucher is a clickbait as they don't want the customer to redeem the voucher, even though the voucher has stated that it should be redeemed within the specified day and period.\n\nDoes this imply that Zouk being a big and trusted corporation are playing click bait to cheat the customers? This is not only unprofessional but also completely disregards the rights of your customers!\n\nWhen I asked to record their statement to raise dispute against Grab, one of the staff touched my phone and raised her tone towards me. This is completely unacceptable. First, did you have permission to touch my personal property? Second, how can you not take responsibility for what you've said, yet still represent Zouk?\n\nI asked for their manager's email and emailed them the day after. But even after 4 days, there's no reply at all. So GO AT YOUR OWN RISK!",

Really great service and floor staff is accommodating. The PR at front of house will escort you to your table and attend to your requests.\n\nOverall I frequent for these reasons, from the staff, music and consistent service. Not forgetting splendid security. No hassle, no fights, always on the ball to keep me and my guests safe. üôèüèΩ\n\nP.S: Check out their food menu, I personally like the mushroom or spicy chicken üçï.",
