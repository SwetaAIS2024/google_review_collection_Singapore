The fried fritters selection are rather limited and prices are on the high side. Chendol tasted horrible and I didn’t appreciate the addition of liquorice(青草) in my dessert.",

      "text": "Very nice and friendly lady boss that served us. Homely feel, chatty with patrons to collect feedback to ensure customer satisfaction is met.  We had their regular prawn noodle soup, assorted Wu Xiang set comprising of sausage, spring roll, ngoh hiang roll, fried tofu, flat fish Hiang and cucumber and ala carte fried prawn cake. We also tried their homemade lemongrass beverage and cendol dessert!\n\nSoup base is rich and prawn size is also bigger than normal. We like that the prawn noodle soup comes with kang kong and bean sprout. Another plus is they served their tasty pork lard on a served condiment dish. The tangy chili sauce complemented the wu Xiang very well. Like that their cucumber slices are very thinly sliced and crunchy.\n\nTaking note that my mom is diabetic, the lady boss told their chef to make the cendol less sweet for her to satisfy my mom’s craving for dessert. Tried it and indeed her bowl of cendol is not as sweet as the regular ones.  The lemongrass drink is refreshing and cleanses our palette.",

      "text": "We came in around lunchtime, 11am-12pm, sadly everyone got served before us. By the time we received our food, the restaurant was already EMPTY. Including customers that came after us.\nWe waited more than 20 minutes for the Ngoh Hiang for them to forget our sausages. Prawn noodles itself took over 40 minutes.\nFirst bowl of noodles, pork rib prawn noodles, came after 42 minutes. The rest came at 47, 49, and 50 respectively. The food was quite good, some things mediocre. 50 minutes for the food and 10 minutes to finish? This wasn't really worth the wait.",
