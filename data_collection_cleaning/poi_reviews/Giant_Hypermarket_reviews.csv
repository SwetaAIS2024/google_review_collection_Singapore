Teo Zi Yao,1,"Cashier was very rude! Rolled eyes and didn't select paywave as she selected UOB which didn't allow my google pay to go through. Had a plastic bag on my own and told her I didn't need more but was shown poor attitude. She was some indian cashier where I never had issue before, customer service is important please buckle up when we are spending money at your establishment.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115891673468220886732/reviews

CHILLI CHILL,4,"Two-storey giant. Very big very spacious. Goods are well organized. Can find many household products & necessities around here.

Human side cashier is slightly slow. Highly reccomend using self-check out counter if possible. (Only accept card payments)

This giant also has the uncle jack cooked food store. Quite reasonably priced roast chicken & food products with decent taste.

Staff are generally quite productive & efficient in replacing all the goods & stocks and quite friendly to all customers.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100539210691864172459/reviews
