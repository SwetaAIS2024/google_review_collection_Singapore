G A,3,"Generally not so good experience at Raffles Urology Center, appreciating the nice clinic environment and friendly staff. However, the waiting time, both for your appointment and for medication and payment, was a bit of a drawback. Considering there are only few patients when I visited. I spent an hour here. 15 mins for consultation, 45 mins just waiting. Delays like that can be frustrating, especially when you have an appointment. I mean you should not expect nothing less in a high class institution.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110239616130172309842/reviews
