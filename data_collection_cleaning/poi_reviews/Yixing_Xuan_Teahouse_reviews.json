      "text": "My partner found this teahouse that is tucked away in the heart of Chinatown and what a gem it is! This small teahouse is a treasure trove for tea enthusiasts. The family-owned business has an impressive selection of over 30 premium Chinese teas. We took a while before deciding on Yinzhen Baihao (white tea) and GABA Oolong in Kungfu style, with the help of the staff who are friendly and incredibly knowledgeable, and happy to guide us through their extensive menu.\n\nWe were able to identify soya bean notes from the Yinzhen Baihao especially after 4-5 rounds of it! And that is why tea appreciation takes time to uncover flavours not noticed before. On a different spectrum, GABA Oolong has a darker brown shade in colour and a fruity taste to it.\n\nKungfu style means that they provide you a full tea set which includes a tea sea, tea pot, glass fair jug, tea cups and a kettle of water with a warmer, for us to better appreciate the tea by going through the process ourselves. Ian explained that Kungfu refers to the skills and precision to master the art.\n\nThe tea leaves were weighed precisely, and the staff provided water of different temperatures as Oolong required hotter water for brewing. A sweet lady surprised us with a tea pet to let us enjoy the tea brewing and have some fun.\n\nTo top it off, we were served a complimentary cold-brewed GABA Oolong brewed over three days, and it was a game changer. We agreed that having the cold brew right after we finished our hot GABA Oolong tasted refreshing as the chill goes well with the fruity flavours.\n\nTo those who are making your way there- run, don’t walk. But check their Instagram first in case they are holding large-group workshops, they might not be open for tea drinking. Their workshops (min 2 pax) are a full package for those who will like to know the A to Z of tea appreciation, or those looking for a date idea!\n\nFor your best experience, take your time exploring the menu and don't hesitate to ask the staff for recommendations. Be sure to try their signature teas, and consider purchasing some to take home.",

The tea and the snacks were delicious and I learned all about kungfu/gongfu tea. Highly recommend this little shop if you are in the area. They have a nice selection of teas, tea pots, cups, diffusers, etc. All their tea pots and many of their cups are made by traditional artisans as well, so support their craft if you can!",
