G Y,4,"The tiny park has been in an interim state for around 3 years now (my estimate), based on the fact that there is a very old “must-wear-your-mask-except-exercise” poster spotted.

Tip: Watch out for mozzies if you do decide to hang around. The lack of maintenance in this park is a pretty good resting/breeding area for them. (-1 star)

Plus points for the park is that there are 2 benches and some greenery for residents.

There are some small and thin slabs lain on the grass field, probably for folks to cross if they like.

There also seems to be construction ongoing at one corner of the park, with sound barriers put up.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111376056027123649376/reviews
