Orange,4,"Nice ktv area with rotation to every table.

Nice vocal singing at the bar that night while I was there.

Friendly staff who are welcoming and nice. Tried asking freebies and yes they gave us hello pandas and fish ball crackers.

Not much food item in the menu, mostly air fried kind of food. ($16 for this tiny bowl of Sotong ball)",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
