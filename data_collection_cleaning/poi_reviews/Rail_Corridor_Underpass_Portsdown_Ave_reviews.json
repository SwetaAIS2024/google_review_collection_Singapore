      "text": "The Rail Corridor Underpass under Portsdown Avenue is a semi-interesting man-made feature along the railway corridor between Alexandra and Tanglin Halt.\n\nIt’s a short but striking tunnel with clean lines, exposed concrete beams, and minimalist lighting that gives it an urban, almost industrial vibe — a nice contrast to the greenery along the trail. The path is well-paved and wide, making it easy for both walkers and cyclists to pass through comfortably.\n\nNothing spectacular, but it adds character to this stretch of the corridor and offers a brief shaded break. There are also a couple of benches if you want to pause and take in the quiet, sheltered space before continuing your walk. A small but thoughtful part of the overall Rail Corridor experience.",

      "text": "A very spacious and sheltered area along the Rail Corridor near Queensway. Well sheltered even during heavy thunderstorms and our goto  destination when unexpected showers caught us near this area. Used to be pretty dark at the start of the Rail Corridor opening; but now as of 2023, solar lights are installed and switched on until 7pm; this means after 7pm during night ride or jog or walk, we still need to bring our own light.",
