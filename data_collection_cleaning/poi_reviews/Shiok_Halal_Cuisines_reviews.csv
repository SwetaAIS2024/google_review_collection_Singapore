Shah,5,"Found this halal spot while waiting for bike repairs. Tried Burmese food for the first time and it was so good!
The burmese laksa is soo creamy (not spicy by default), but the chili fish floss gave it a little more kick.
Many dishes for you to choose from too. Wife had chicken with butter rice.

Nice staff and chill location",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108709497516466016868/reviews
