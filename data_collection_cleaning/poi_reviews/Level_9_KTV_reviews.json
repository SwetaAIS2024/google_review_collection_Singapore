      "text": "The overall standard has dropped significantly compared to my previous visits. The girl only sat with me for 2‚Äì5 minutes before leaving to butterfly for almost an hour. I used to frequent Level 9 quite often in the past, but it‚Äôs been a while since my last visit and things have clearly changed.\n\nThe mamasan, Angel, was extremely rude. She kept pressuring me to make payment and even raised her voice, shouting at me despite me being a customer. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre desperate for that $50 or what, but her attitude was completely unacceptable and ruined the entire experience.\n\nBrothers, I strongly advise you not to come to this KTV . I‚Äôve been going to KTVs for a long time, and I can confidently say that the standard here is no longer what it used to be. Unless if u which dont mind to be taken advantage of and being scolded by their staff called Angel",
