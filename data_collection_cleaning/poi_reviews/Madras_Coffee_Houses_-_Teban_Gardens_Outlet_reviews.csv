Rajkapoor K,4,"Budget friendly South Indian coffee shop. Located just in Teban gardens neighbourhood. Was here for breakfast and evening snacks on same day.
Breakfast combos are good and affordable. Best part is they prepare tea/coffee with fresh milk (not condensed milk) and cane sugar (not refined/processed white sugar). The tea/coffee is serves in glass tumbler!
Snacks in the evening time was good as well.  Egg puffs is a must try!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101777615474112208644/reviews
