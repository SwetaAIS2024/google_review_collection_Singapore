Riduan Abu,1,"Ordered from 6pm but until 9pm still no pick up. I have to go down to collect myself which is an inconvenience. When i arrive , the two ladies were chit chatting . I tried calling them on the phone but they never answer. They keep hanging up the phone . When i ask the lady , she say its grab fault for not giving me a rider . Which is ridiculous because the app says kitchen delay. When i ask her if my food have been sitting at the counter for 2 hours plus ? She say huh cannot hear when my voice is clear enough . Giving me face and attitude. I repeated again and she say yes. She never even try to make the situation better by offering to reheat . I have to ask her for a reheat of my food . Than she do it with an attitude and show me face. Already inconvenience for me to wait and go down physically . On top of that the staff have a bad attitude . Not even a single apology .. this is ridiculous",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102790292927503016527/reviews

Timothy Gan,1,"Did not honour Shopback promotion, gave excuse that $0.90 deal is a new one different from $2.90 promotion, and hence only Cheese pizza is redeemable. In fact the voucher condition states four classic flavours redeemable (see Screenshot). Did not want to make a commotion as other customers waiting in line so settled with the Cheese pizza. However, staff attitude and knowledge is really horrible.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110673576605008456627/reviews
