      "text": "This dish is a true visual and culinary delight. The barramundi fish fillet is perfectly seared to a crisp golden brown, with tender, flaky flesh beneath. A bed of fresh greens and finely shredded cabbage adds color, texture, and a refreshing crunch.\n\nTopped with thinly sliced onions, microgreens, and a glossy sauce, the dish balances acidity and sweetness, enhancing the fish‚Äôs natural flavors. The thoughtful presentation and vibrant ingredients make this a must-try for seafood lovers. Elegant, fresh, and flavorful‚Äîthis dish is a standout!",

      "text": "Clean and spacious with a lovely peaceful atmosphere.\nFood was great. We ate: beef burger with omu rice - quite an acceptable portion for the money - beef burger was juicy and tender; barramundi with shaved fennel and lunor potatoes - delicious,  the fish was cooked to perfection with crispy skin; sweet potatoes fries with truffle dip - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, best sweet potatoes fries. A jug of water was $2.50, however, it was the most refreshing water because of the lemon and lime slices.\nThe food is served quite fast from the moment you order it. However, a suggestion for the staff would be to pay a bit more attention to the dinners and their requests. We waited quite a while to get the water.\nOverall a good experience.",

It‚Äôs TCC signature dish, an absolute must-try. The drinks are always refreshing and perfectly complement the meal.
