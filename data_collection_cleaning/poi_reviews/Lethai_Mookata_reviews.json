It comes with chicken, pork slices, prawns, scallops, squid, fishball and a basket of vegs. The meat is well marinated and covered with lots of chopped garlic.\n\nThe beef cube was tender and well marbled.\n\nTheir moo-ping is a must order. It tasted better than some of those which I tried in Bangkok.\n\nWill definitely revisit.",
