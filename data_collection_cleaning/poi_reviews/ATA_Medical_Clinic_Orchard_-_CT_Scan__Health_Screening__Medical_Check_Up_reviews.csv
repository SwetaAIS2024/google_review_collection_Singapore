Justin Chia,5,I had a very positive health screening experience with ATA Medical. Dr Leonard was patient in understanding and explaining my health concerns. The nurse who drew my blood was experienced and the experience was painless. My experience with the other clinic staff who did my treadmill ECG and CT scan were also extremely positive and they were patient in explaining the procedure to me. I completed all my tests in 2.5h and the waiting time between each station was reasonable for a Saturday. Will highly recommend this clinic for health screening needs.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104516823037590228795/reviews

RCU_de,5,"All the staff were very accomodating.

I was quite amazed how they pay attention with all their clients esp with the ladies at the reception, when I asked if I was already done, without even asking my particulars, 1 lady simply told me I still have 3 other doors to go in and asked me to sit & wait for awhile to be called. I just didn‚Äôt got her name but 2 thumbs üëçüèº üëçüèº for her.

The lady who took my ECG is quite remarkable. The way she chatted with me made me so comfortable.

The doctor was very nice.

The service was greatüëçüèº",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113113132849253109063/reviews
Daniel Chia,5,"Booking was seamless, I emailed and got an appointment 2 days later! They communicate through WhatsApp and email, and provide very clear pre check up instructions, if you have any questions, their WhatsApp respond time is very fast within the day during office hours.

I did the Royal package health screening and I was done in 1.5 hours from check in to payment.

The clinic was busy for a Fri AM, but the staff were very efficient and patient to process the patients.
The nurse that drew my blood sample was super skilled, I barely felt anything!
The layout and lighting of the clinic also helped to make it feel less congested and comfortable.

TIP:
1. You can collect the stool/urine sample kit prior to your health screen.
2. Parking is exorbitant, I think it was close to $6/hour. Orchard Boulevard MRT (brown line) is just around the corner.
3. There is a Killiney cafe and Fat Cow restaurant on level 1 of the building.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115631069523118287655/reviews
