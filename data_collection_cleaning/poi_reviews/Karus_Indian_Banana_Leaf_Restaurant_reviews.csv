Gillian Ng,5,"Been eating here for over 20 years. Food has remained consistently good. We always order the mutton curry, sotong curry and tandoori chicken. The yellow rice and 2 side veggies, always delicious as well. Free flow poppadoms are light, crispy and yummy.
Service is quite efficient but can be challenging when the restaurant is full.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111859550761883748316/reviews
derek neo,4,"Karu's Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant is a gem along Upper Bukit Timah! I'm a huge fan of their fish head curry, but today's try of their butter chicken and mutton biryani was great! Both dishes were delicious, but the butter chicken stole the show - it's hands down the best I've ever tasted! Rich, creamy, and full of flavour.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113015523826545524096/reviews
TAN KC,5,"Long time never come.  Food still great. Another great place to enjoy some Indian food. Even seem a birthday celebration here. So nice.

Staffs are friendly and nice. But tends to cluster in a group at the counter. But will come immediately when call.

:)

Car Parking wise have to innovate.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116977734900435385927/reviews
Kian Yong,3,"Fish head curry lacked depth of flavour and felt rather flat. Mutton was also so-so and nothing to shout about. For all papadum lovers, it is free flow. Parking is quite limited and can be a hassle to find.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100397776802769895381/reviews
Jo C,2,"Food was decent, however the restaurant wasn't very hygienic. All 4 of us felt queasy after lunch.

Tables, chairs and floor were greasy and waiters wore the same gloves when handling food and clearing tables.

Parking was a major problem at the Upper Bukit Timah branch. Very limited parking available at the next building.

While the food was decent, I probably will NOT be back for a while until they ""clean up"" their act.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115445659979747587481/reviews
