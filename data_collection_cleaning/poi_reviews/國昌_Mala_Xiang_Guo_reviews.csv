Pearline Foo,4,"Love this place for 水煮鱼 and 汤面 (noodle soup). Their 水煮鱼 is aways piping hot🔥 with lots of soy beansprouts and spiciness is just right for my little one. We have been coming here for years and generally no crowd at coffeeshop on evenings but can get crowded during lunch. The lady at the stall always make an effort to remember what we like and our orders. They can remember even if we don't visit for months.

The fried rice is decent too and prices are very affordable. What's most impressive is what they really go out of their way to help with your requests. We like to have our noodle soup only with the veg ingredient and they would accommodate.

Worth checking out if you are in the area. The quiet of the place is an extra bonus as we don't like to squeeze.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105478599358175149208/reviews
Jeremy Khoo,5,Spicy and yummy mala at affordable price. About half the price of another recent place I went and I ordered more this time. Can use CDC vouchers some more! Ordered medium spicy and it was just bearable with a great numbing tongue feeling. Great to sweat it out on a cool rainy evening. A bit hard to get to if you don’t drive but parking is free and it’s not crowded which is great. Service is super fast and friendly.

David Yuen,5,"Since my discovery of this Mala corner. I’ve not patronise any other Mala eatery.
Their Mala spice is so 🤯. Spicy level 小|中|大 🔥... My preference 中🔥+... ask for less oil.
I can have it almost 2 times per week. Averagely $12-$16 for two pax size. No additional charge for their takeaway container 😃👍🏻. Operated by friendly chinese lady boss.
Just to add...i don’t work nor stay near that area😄.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106797599471818731960/reviews
Jeremy,5,"Cheap and good MALA and dishes (sour shredded potato was awesome). Although Xiao la is abit too spicy for me, but the flavor was on point. Will ask for less than xiao spicy next time!
Price was also amazingly affordable. Lady staff was very polite as well. Good food and good service! Will definitely come back to satisfy my MALA cravings. 5 STARS ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103559520480408344818/reviews
