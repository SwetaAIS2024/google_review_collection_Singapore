      "text": "My friend wanted to try the Bespoke Bar when we were nearby Arab street but it was full when we went twice. There was no way to reserve seating calling or physically, and can only be done via online booking. We went elsewhere that night.\n\nOn the 2nd night, we tried our luck again and managed to get a seating after waiting for 15 minutes as another table left earlier. The bartender (Kenneth) was very friendly and fun to chat with. We ordered quite a few drinks based on his recommendation. I can’t really remember the names of the drinks and would be good if Maison Ikkoku could reply me here for learning pleasure for all. Oh, we also tried the Escargo and that was my first time as I’ve never liked the idea of eating it but hey, it was really garlicky soft and nice. I might try Escargo again!\n\nOverall 10/10 would return as the ambience is very nice despite a place with little seating. But that makes it cosy and exclusive.",

At the back of the bar there is an outdoor area that overlooks the largest mosque in Singapore. Too bad this bar is closing soon. Hope another operator will take over.",
