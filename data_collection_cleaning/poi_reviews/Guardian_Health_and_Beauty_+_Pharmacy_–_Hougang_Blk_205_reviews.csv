Vonvon Liang,1,I had came to guardian at kovan branch at 9.20pm in the rush to buy a medication but cashier just told me they are closed and shut the shutter immediately. It’s only 9.20pm not 9.30pm. It’s urgent that why last min rush there to get it. So check the time for closing- it’s stated 9.30pm close.

N O,5,"We were served by Hazi when we made some enquiry on medication. Not only was she friendly, she was patient and took time to recommend us alternative method to solve our problem. It was delightful to encounter someone like her when we were feeling sick and in need of medical care.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116315505302335582154/reviews

AGA,5,"Have a prescription from my doctor and tried this pharmacy. The pharmacists here are very helpful. It seems like they have every kind of medicine which lots of clinics don't carry.
If they don't have it at hand, they will get it from the other branches.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112995918995368943666/reviews
dcl,1,"Went over 10mins before closing time n it was already shutting down the shutters n I was refused entry by staff saying it’s closed already. I checked the time n I’m fully aware it’s closing time is 9.30pm not 9.20pm or earlier

Found alternative needs at the cold storage at heartland mall - so head there instead of Guardian!

Also, pls update your closing time to 9.15pm or whenever your staff decides to stop serving n shut the store down.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112436818522277052727/reviews
