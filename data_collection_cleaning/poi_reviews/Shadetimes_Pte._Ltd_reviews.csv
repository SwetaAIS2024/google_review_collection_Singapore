Rachel Chia,5,"I engaged Shadetimes through recommendation, and I am very impressed with their workmanship. Marcus was really professional and Iâ€™m impressed with his depth of knowledge and expertise. Any challenges that arose were handled with transparency and quick solutions. I highly recommend Shadetimes - Marcus for anyone looking to do awnings. Fyi I did the 'Latin Blinds'.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100244803833232735475/reviews
Bike Viking,5,"I engaged a company name Shadetimes Pte Ltd for some shades works last year 2024 December and got to know the sales person Mr Alvin Ong.
Alvin present to me some of the products but honestly I didn't know much about those products at that point of time but I can see he is knowledgeable on what he does and price was reasonable too so we engaged him. The awnings were well installed and proper till today and we are so glad with the workmanship from this company and not only that, to my findings, Shadetimes Pte Ltd is the only company using original imported system from Spain compared to many are who are not.
We are so fortunate to engaged a reliable company like Shadetimes and will not hesitate to introduce them to our neighbours and friends.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102293625196813844619/reviews

stylusyeo,5,We want you to know that we are very pleased with the quality of service and product your company provides. We sincerely appreciate your responsiveness (Alvin) and the swift installation work by rest of the  team. The motorised vertical drop system from Spain that you recommended to us looks and feels very robust unlike other system that we used before. We are glad that we have made the right decision. We look forward to doing business with you for years to come.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104905232639763436023/reviews
