Played some classic 80s music.\n\nThey’ve got decent drink and bottle deals but we still ended up spending $650 with two bottles of gin and heaps of food!\n\nFood was so so and will start with the good… Brussel sprouts and pork cubes were nice.  Bruschetta pizza was actually quite good too. Chicken wings were decent but had better ones. Karaage was more of a chicken cutlet in strips but tasted okay. Wasabi prawns lacked the wasabi flavor. Hokkien Mee lacked wok hey or the char it needs.",

A huge assortment of beer and good appetizers.\nBar with a good atmosphere and pleasant live music. Very importantly, the burgers here are amazing. The burgers are not very big, but with a thick and juicy patty. Be careful, before 8 pm the price of beer is 3 dollars lower.\nThe bar has a lot of promotions with alcoholic drinks, look carefully at the screens inside the establishment.\n5 points for beer, burgers and live music.",
