I tried all types of chicken skewers.\n\nBut the display food looks very unappetising. I feel can be improved. Just honest feedback.\n\nEdit: Revisited it again today, same friendly staff, and same great taste!!! It’s starting to become my favourite place to eat.\n\nEdit 2: I have eaten here 10 over times and the quality never drops. Highly recommend!",
