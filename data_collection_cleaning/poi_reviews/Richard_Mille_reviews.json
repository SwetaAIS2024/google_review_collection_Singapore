      "text": "Located at MBS Hotel Tower 2.\nFirstly, the staffs were friendly and approachable. They took time to share the history of Richard Mille and also on the superior technology vs other brands watches.\nSecondly, the design and layout of the store were very impressive. Gave a very modern and luxurious feeling.\nLastly, the majestic grandeur and simplicity of RM watches were so captivating... easily justify the prices for the watches.\n\nThe lady manager gave me a RM magazine, really appreciated her kind and generous gesture.\n\nOverall experience 10 stars!",

Refused to assist as it was an after market strap (I had to get an after market strap as the rubber belts are completely sold out and the wait time is over a year where I live).\n\nI mentioned that Iâ€™m not from town and asked if they could point me somewhere which I could pay to change the strap OR if they could lend me the tool for me to change the strap myself.\n\nFlat out refused and hurriedly tried to get me out the store. Shame on RM and the branch manager who simply looked on.",
