AC Chan,4,"Double happiness with Andersen’s all-time favourite dessert that comes with banana, 3 scoops of ice cream of your choice, waffle cone, fresh cream and chocolate drizzle!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Ran Wong,4,"Let me introduce you to Anderson's ice cream, a delightful treat that brings joy to my taste buds on a regular basis.

While your wallet might suffer some bruises after ordering, but the ice cream itself has magical properties that can turn even the saddest frown into a sugary smile. It's a budget-friendly indulgence that will melt away your financial worries, especially when enjoyed with your beloved family members.

The taste is like a harmonious symphony of flavors that dance gracefully on your tongue. Not too sweet, not too bland, it hits that sweet spot of perfection.

Try their bingsu too! It's a glorious mountain of icy goodness that's fully loaded and ready to be conquered. It's so generous in size that you can share it with your significant other and still have enough to satisfy your sweet tooth.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104521987000442146195/reviews
Tracy Lee,5,"The Black Forest waffle was delicious. It’s crunchy with a rich texture. Choice of ice cream was chocolate rum (alcoholic) and blueberry which helped to satisfy my craving for wanting something that’s not so sweet, yet rich and has a contrast in the taste (trying to fulfil my tastebud from the 2 scoops of ice-cream :p). The freakrainbow drink is a milkshake with 3 types of ice cream that you can choose from. It looked so pretty and has an interesting taste. It takes time to prepare though and can be challenging to remove the chocolate off the glass. Mocha was great: liked that it was not sweet. Overall, enjoyed the dining experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111797665201251856403/reviews
Suriati Sujadi,3,"We came to dine in today, Sun 13th Oct’24.
While towards the shop we taught it closed as lights off.
Approached there was family with 2 kids looking at the variety of flavours, the staff female alone at the sink playing with her hp.
I called her and ask whether the shop opened, she replied, yes. Then she just stand at the cashier counter whithout asking or ever initiative to serve us.
The family then walked away.
After we had chosen and made payment we sat, then she on the lights…time 11.50am, which shop i guess open at 11am.
She seems foreigner, not local.
Very but customer service.
Management should monitor and observe as she the only staff at the time.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114777293568044413743/reviews
Divyanshu Mahajan,5,"I have always taken their takeaway tub, but this time I tried a scoop at the booth and the staff was so very welcoming and patient with our order. The ice cream ofcourse is deeelicious!! I’ve tried dine-in and the cafe is pretty good with waffle combos and many other options. The staff are rather patient and helpful. They make the experience worthy of appreciation.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110651958606620480842/reviews
