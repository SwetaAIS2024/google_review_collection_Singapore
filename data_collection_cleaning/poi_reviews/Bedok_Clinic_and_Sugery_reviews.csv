Dave,1,"The doctor is old and insisted his medicine/treatment is correct despite patient already telling him that was tried and failed. My parent took the stronger medicine and ended up going to hospital (surgery).

The receptionists also made NO effort to explain each medicine, I had to google whether to consume before or after food (it was before) and their purpose. Labels didnt write either.

Thanks to the  clinic for worsening the condition which led to discovering the real issue through hospital CT scan.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108635694491896979989/reviews
Joyce Neo,1,"I was having running nose, blocked nose , itchy throat and cough. The doctor prescribed only cough medicine and lozenges (orange tablet)The medicine given were at the cheaper range and mild. The staff mentioned they were unable to give better/expensive as I am under IHP. This is my first time receiving such a remark and having one cough medicine and lozenges to bring home.

Chia Yee Cheng,1,"Hi, understand that our healthcare providers are important, but please update hours to 9.30am, if the doctor is going to arrive late. To all viewing this, if hours still remain at 9am, please arrive 30mins late because the doctor might not be there yet.

It is better to post accurate information that to mislead people.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114036175689827982584/reviews
G T,1,"Wish I read the reviews earlier. Decided to go online to see who the doctor is while waiting for the past hour for him to arrive at the clinic. True enough the doctor arrived an hour after the clinic opened. No respect or care for the many sick patients waiting since 9am and from the reviews, this seems to be the norm rather than the exception. Definitely going to be our first and last time here!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113495852121160741958/reviews
