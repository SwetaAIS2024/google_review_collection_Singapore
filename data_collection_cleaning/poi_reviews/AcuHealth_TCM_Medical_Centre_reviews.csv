Haikal Tan,5,"I contacted the clinic at 9am to book an appointment for pain in my right shoulder and was able to secure a 10am slot, which was incredibly convenient. The receptionist was extremely polite, efficient, and helpful.

Dr. Yan Xiu Yun is fluent in both English and Mandarin, and she patiently explained the necessary treatment for my injury, ensuring I felt comfortable and informed. The treatment included acupuncture and cupping, which was completed in under 30 minutes.

After the session, my shoulder felt significantly lighter, and the pain had greatly reduced.

I highly recommend this clinic for anyone seeking effective and professional care.

D Ah Sue,5,"Went to visit without an appoint on saturday morning around 1030am , 9 sep 2023.

Registration was smooth & easy. The entire ambience is clean , u dont really see dirt around.

Doctor Yan Xiu Yun able to speak in english/chinese/hokkien.

She performed pulse measurement on both wrists, took down my blood pressure + heart rate as standard protocol no diff from western medical visit.

She patiently asked about my injuries (neck strained due to exercise) , performed test on my neck (yes the twist and turn you get from thai massage) and confirmed that its just due to straining , not fracture etc.

Her treatment include
1) Acupunture
2) Cupping
3) massage equipment (that portable thing where you can massage around your body on ur own )
4) some warm item to go around my neck
5) provided one small tub (travelling size) balm for affected area, external use

Overall, i was able to feel the effectiveness post-5 hours after the visit, the following day im at least 80% recovered .

I enjoy engaging a conversation with her and she is able to address my fear of pain during the massage + acupunture.

Very motherly and friendly, for sure is a child-friendly place if ever need to visit a TCM.

i would rate effectiveness 9/10",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113189455808770153641/reviews
