When it‚Äôs not too busy, they even serve the food to your table. The ingredients are generous and delicious‚Äîespecially the pork slices, which are really tasty. The prices are also very reasonable. I‚Äôll definitely keep coming back. Wishing the boss have good business!",

Crispy pork lard and a nice cooked sambal added to the dining experience. No wok hei though. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs essential with a braised noodle dish.\nService was friendly and they even helped us carry some of the plates to our table.",

So, we ordered both dishes that were popular at that nearby stall.\n\nThe Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee was okay initially.   But the taste builds up and gets better as we continue to take more mouthfuls üëç\n\nThe Fried Kway Teow definitely outshines the nearby stall üëçüëç\n\nThere was only one lady in front of us and we received the food within 5-10 minutes.",

Read that they are a breakaway stall from 618 hkm.\n\nPortion is good for $5, cooked by a Vietnamese lady. They use 3 types of mee, yellow mee, thin bee hoon & thick bee hoon. Taste surprisingly good, gravy has prawny taste, pork lard is crispy and chili is different (a little sour) but spicy (guess it's Vietnamese style). Will try their ckt next time.\n\nWe will be back!\n\nüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã",
