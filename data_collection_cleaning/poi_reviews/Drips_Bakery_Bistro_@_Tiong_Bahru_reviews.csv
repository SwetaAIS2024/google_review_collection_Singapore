jaynk elps,4,"We tried their Berry cute panda. It was actually good and tasty. I was expecting it to have more shaved iced but i was in for a surprise when we almost finished it. The sweet potato fries was mediocre but the smoked salmon dill was surprisingly good.

Atmosphere was good. I like to go back and try other kakigoris and pastries.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100735909879306938030/reviews
Judy Huang,4,"ðŸ“Œ Highlights: Yuzu matcha + meat quiche

Iced yuzu matcha is well balanced with a soothing color and goes well with desserts. Came for the shaved ice, but ended up trying the tempting desserts instead.

â€¢ Meat quiche (10/10)
â€¢ Eggless honey lemon cheesecake (8.5/10) textureâ€™s good as a cheesecake, just a bit pricey
â€¢ Avocado tart (8/10) smooth combo, but no lasting impression. Add 0.5 for the light, not-too-heavy cream
â€¢ Mac&cheese 7/10 good but just average",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100383338300088014362/reviews
Shawn Dabi,5,"The matcha shaved ice dessert is soft, fluffy, and really looks like a soft cotton candy! Itâ€™s not too sweet yet it is very delightfulâ€¦. Must try!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106232470726851561809/reviews
Viva La Vida,5,"Whenever I am nearby I'll drop by. In my opinion the best tarts I've ever had. Love their Chocolate truffle, rich yet not sweet. Fruit tarts are awesome too. What makes the tarts really good is the crust which is perfectly done to my personal liking, not too soft. Ambience is relaxing, brilliant for personal chilling or hangouts with friends. The tart prices have increased so much over the years but I kept returning because it's that good ha! Having said that, drink prices are pretty reasonable, cappuccino is good. Street parking available but might be challenging during peak hours.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101978204761063024043/reviews
Yordan Yit,4,"Tucked away in the heart of Tiong Bahru, this charming cafÃ© offers a peaceful escape from the cityâ€™s fast pace. The inviting and cozy atmosphere makes it a great spot to relax, whether youâ€™re unwinding alone or catching up with friends.

The pastries here never fail to impress. The pistachio croissant is a standout, with a perfect balance of sweetness and butteriness that enhances the flavors of the dough. The nasi lemak is equally delightfulâ€”fragrant, savory and indulgent from the very first bite. And if youâ€™re a pasta lover, the waguyu beef linguine is a must-tryâ€”deeply rich yet not overly filling, with perfectly textured strands that add to its appeal.

Coffee enthusiasts will appreciate the well-crafted drinks. The flat white delivers a bold, full-bodied flavor that stands out from the watered-down versions found elsewhere. The drink prices are quite reasonable, making it easy to pair your coffee with your delicious food.

If youâ€™re in the area, this cafÃ© is definitely worth a visitâ€”just keep in mind that parking can be tricky during peak hours!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111794790666094275154/reviews
