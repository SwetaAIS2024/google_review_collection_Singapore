      "text": "this is personally the best school as i will never forget my old classmates and friends. those 6 years were the best of my life and looking back, a lot has changed and i have no regrets. the blood sweat and tears both students and teachers put into this school have molded it into what it is today. i still remember my p1 friends and teachers. i remember the first time i entered the school i was crying as it was a new environment and i had no idea who to talk to and what to do. i felt lost and now that im moving to secondary school it feels the exact same. i will not ever forget these memories i hold dearly and will appreciate the effort both me and my teachers put in to get me to where i am today. if i had to tell any parents thinking about enrolling their child into this school, it would be to tell them that this school is very friendly and will take care of your child. the teachers here care about their students very much and are very nice. i hope that this helps at least one parent decide which school they want their child to go to. so in my opinion this is the best school in singapore. shine forth Vistalites!",
