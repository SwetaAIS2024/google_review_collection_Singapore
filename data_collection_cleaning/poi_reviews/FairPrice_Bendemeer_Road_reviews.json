The service was not only rude, but I also overheard her gossiping incessantly with her colleagues, all while pretending to be friendly at the same time. Hypocrite! What a shame to tarnish the reputation of such a well-known brand. Fortunately, she isn't assigned to any of the larger stores in the mall.",

The size is approximately three 7-Eleven convenience store. Am quite surprised that FairPrice does not have a bigger outlet here as the Bendemeer estate has a lot of residents.",

They are empathetic and the lady Filipino manager handles the verification process professionally to avoid scams. Appreciate the effort.\nThe shop is small in size compared to most NTUC outlets because it's more of a franchise shop like some NTUC Cheers outlet. However, I have also observed that most of the staffs and manager working there are very patient with elderly at the cashier counters, especially during long queues.\nAs this is a mature estate with a lot of elderly, their attitude is worth the compliment.\nIf you have no patience during payment queues, I will advise you to buy at other places.",
