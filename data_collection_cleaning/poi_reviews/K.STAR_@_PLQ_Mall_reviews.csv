Bryan Fang,5,"Tried out karaoke here for the first time. 6pax given a Thematic room at $35++/hr. Room is amazingly designed, different room had different designs. Quite swee laaa. 6pax felt abit small although cosy.

Ordered a tower of Amber Nectar beer, bucket of Asahi, bucket of Hoegarden and few bottles of soju. Fyi, alcohol does not cover for room usage so room charge is a separate cost.

Great service, staff were friendly.

Karaoke system abit lacking due to some songs not able to find even though quite popular for many years. Good thing was they have updated new songs like APT and Mantra. Sound system was pretty good too.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114490699769830179262/reviews
Moxij Tan,5,"I really love the sponge bob room. Yellow colour and have those theme to entertain me. Sound system is good and one of the best. Near to where I stay as well.

TripleJ,4,"They have very adorable team like Mario, SpongeBob etc which we requested during our reservation.

Upon arrive, we was told by the lady we are lucky that she assign SpongeBob room to us?! Lucky?? We had specially call up to request & reserve 2-3 weeks before hence it isn’t very nice to be told as she only assign today when we had already specific and requested since is for our daughter birthday. Hope this lady can use her word correctly and not confusing consumer.

Would we return, no. Customer service here not as friendly as PS branch. Here don’t serve food/ snack but you can purchase your own food in but just have to clear up before you leave.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111800257041260772993/reviews
Linda yang,4,"Failing the star rating because the service was really bad and we were being stopped for bringing our own water into the room.  just because no outside food and drinks allowed. #byob even your mineral looking water bottle is not allowed. After we insisted, the service staff brought us to the room and continued to nag at us for the water. Tbh, I can understand if it's bbt or other drinks, but it's just water?!

The atmosphere is good, the place is clean, new and themed. Can play around with the lights as well. The playlist can be controlled using individual phones - very convenient!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114203969313129251448/reviews
