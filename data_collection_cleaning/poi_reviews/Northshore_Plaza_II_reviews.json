Do remember to clean up after them so you don‚Äôt give the side-eye intolerant folks any more grief.",

      "text": "The extension of Northshore Plaza l was completed just near the start of 2022 and visitors can now access Plaza ll via an overhead bridge from Plaza l Level 2 or cross the street on Level 1 instead.\n\nSome of them are yet to be officially opened but more will come in Q1 2022. Some famous brands include A&W (super long queue but confident hype will diminish in a few months), Daiso, 4Fingers, Dancing Crab. There will be a newly opened food court as well run by Kopitiam. Similar to Plaza l, it has an open air design concept with three levels. Walkways are very spacious and there‚Äôs even a full view to the sea at the end of Level 2! Really great place to enjoy the sea breeze!\n\nWill be sure to visit again after Q1 to visit the rest of the stalls. Really convenient for adjacent housing apartments. Great for elderly, kids, families and dates!",
