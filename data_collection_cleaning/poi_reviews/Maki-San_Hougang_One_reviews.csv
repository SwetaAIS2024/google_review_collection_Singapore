Wendy Loh (whimsea.wanderer),5,"Have not ordered from Maki-San for sometime üòÖ. Saw from their IG that they have recently launched the Mega D.I.Y Merry Chickmas Fries Meal (S$14.90) and decided to give it a try.

I usually order their salad but decided to customise my own sushi this time round. I ‚ù§Ô∏è the cute box design. The chickmas üê• fries were not too bad and the jalape√±o nacho sauce was not spicy at all. Mind you that my spice tolerance level is 2/10.

If you can‚Äôt decide what to order, can always opt for their house sushi or house salad. üôÇ

Don‚Äôt really like their location here as it‚Äôs next to an arcade centre and washrooms. Not an ideal area to wait around to collect your order.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116391448637858467398/reviews
KP T88 Family,1,"This outlet is one I will never visit again. Half (4 out 8 pieces) of my maki was not filled up properly with the said-ingredients. The staff have terrible attitude problem when there is no order in the making. One of them was still listening to music with an ear-bud, pretending not to see customer. At the time, the store was not flooding with orders & they never will with such food quality and staff working there.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114675644591358126154/reviews

i . am . kenny,3,Newly-established place in Hougang 1. Food taste similar to other Maki-san outlets. Serve both salad bowl and sushi in a box. Able to customised your salad and sushi. Walkway infront of shop is narrow and can get quite crowded as it leads to the restroom.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112751483720403503929/reviews
