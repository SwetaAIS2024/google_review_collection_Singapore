BERNARD ‚ÄúBERD‚Äù HO,5,"Have been looking around for a decent wanton mee in the bukit batok west area, and finally found it through one of the earlier google reviews. Surprisingly well priced, decent, tasty wanton mee with q noodles (not yeasty kind) executed in al dente fashion, served with 3 plump wantons stuffed with meat and chestnut for solid mouthfeel. Char siews are decent portions sliced nicely but would be better if it had a roastier flavor. Putting this on steady dabao roster!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107117292040105181031/reviews
Yeo Selwyn,5,"Tried the fried pork with fermented bean curd noodles. Noodles was springy and fresh. The fried pork was very crispy and melts in the mouth. Chilli was good, but a tad bit salty. Portion & ingredients was quite a lot for $5.50.
Also tried the fried wanton, but felt the fried pork was better.
Definitely worth a try if you are nearby in bukit batok area.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101611881754199477228/reviews
