The high tea set is absolutely delightful, with a wonderful selection of teas and delicious treats. The eclairs that come with the set are a standout—perfectly balanced and not overly sweet, which is a relief since sometimes desserts can feel overwhelming.\n\nThe ambiance is always cozy and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a relaxing afternoon. Every visit has been consistently enjoyable, and I can't wait to return! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a top-notch high tea experience.",

      "text": "The eclairs were heavenly. The dark chocolate had a lovely rich chocolate cream topped with three chocolate streusels (choc balls) which gave it a nice crunch. The salter caramel was delightfully sweet and salty, very well balanced flavor. A lovely afternoon tea pitstop. I did notice their pasta lunch menu which looked and smelled delicious so will be back for the next round of reviews.",
