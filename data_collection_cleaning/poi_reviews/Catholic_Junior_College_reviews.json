Coding with older people is very fun, I learnt to be confident and learn basic skills from the coding event the students there made me feel very welcome honestly I am very impressed that they are very nice I thought they will be like normal teachers scolding us but there was a lot of laughter although the program is over I would not forget this memorable day thank you to the stem club members for helping me learn how to code it was  a splendid two days of my life I have turn over a new leaf over the two days. CJC yall are amazing!!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š",
