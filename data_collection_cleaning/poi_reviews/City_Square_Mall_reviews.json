I must say that this is one of my favourite malls as there's just everything that you might need from supermarkets, electronics, sport outlets, very interesting restaurants and fast food chains like McDonalds & KFC. It's quite practical for many foreigners as there's also lots of ATM Cash Machines and Currency Exchange facilities on the lower floors.",

      "text": "City Square Mall has seen some recent renovations, giving the place a refreshed look while keeping it just as convenient and accessible. The updates include modernized interiors, improved lighting, and upgraded seating areas, making the shopping experience more pleasant.\n\nThe retail mix remains strong, with stores ranging from fashion and lifestyle to electronics and home essentials. The dining options continue to impress, with plenty of choices for both quick bites and sit-down meals. The food court has also been revamped, with better seating arrangements and a cleaner, more organized layout.\n\nFor those who enjoy shopping for sports gear, Decathlon is still a highlight, while FairPrice remains a convenient spot for groceries. The Golden Village cinema is a good option for moviegoers, now enhanced with better facilities.\n\nThe renovations have definitely improved the overall ambiance, making City Square Mall a solid shopping and dining destination with a fresher, more modern feel.",

The last 2 years have been tough as they went for major revamp. Disappointed the popular has shrunk so much. Some interesting tenants but still not the same as before.",
