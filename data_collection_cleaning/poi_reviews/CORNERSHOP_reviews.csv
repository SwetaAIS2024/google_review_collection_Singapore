Michael Lee,5,"I visited on a weekday morning at 10 AM. The queue was short, and it took about 15 minutes to order and receive my drink.

As for the dirty matcha, I found it quite average. If I were in the area, I would consider coming back, but I wouldnâ€™t make a special trip just for the drink.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105168428131183701883/reviews
Leow Chang Ying,5,"Decided to head down to CORNERSHOP as I am a matcha lover myself and I saw it on Tiktok and it caught my attention so I went down to try.

For drinks, I got the Ice Matcha Latte ($5.50 + $0.1 for takeaway). The matcha was traditional hand whisk with the cha sen and matcha bowl. The taste, astringency, and mouthfeels wise are okay to me as there are much better matcha places out there, but for the price point of $5.50, I felt it was good enough as it is in the hawker centre so no complains on that.

They do sell traditional nan yang coffee too from Yong Seng, a traditional nan yang coffee distributor in singapore. Will try it next time if I have the chance to.

*Do note that if you are getting matcha tea/latte, you will have to wait as it is hand whisk and hand whisking takes some time, so please do not scold and be patient. If you are in a rush, I would suggest not getting it and going for coffee instead.

jen robertson,5,"Do NOT go past this stall!!

It is wonderful to have this upmarket coffee option in this small established market at competitive prices (there are 3 traditional coffee operators here). â€˜Upmarketâ€™ as in the high standard of coffee and its variations, not in the physical brick-&-mortar sense of the word.

Nonetheless, the stallâ€™s small footprint is effectively optimised for easy workflow. Itâ€™s a very tidy, clean and hip operation ..I enjoyed the choice of music played at a very considerate volume so as not to disturb the neighbours.

The owner operator, Valerie, is a breath of fresh air.. with her soft spoken manner, cheerful disposition; she is very unassuming and approachable. Patiently she answered my numerous questions about the choice of beans she uses, the range of products etc.

Iâ€™ve only tried the kopi C, oat milk latte and the kopi cold brew on different visits. The coffee Valerie offers is very smooth, has good depth, strong enough without being too acidic or strong.

Highly recommended; 5/5ðŸŒŸ",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110546596939545479869/reviews
Kristi J,5,"New stall at Marinne Terrace hawker Center!

Fell in love the moment I drank their iced matcha latte and canâ€™t resist to get another cup of iced houjicha after that. I must say the drinks are better than some popular cafes out there ðŸ¥¹

Totally understand the longer waiting time as the stall handler are only one person and I believe good things comes to people who can wait ðŸ¤­ do spare more time if you intend to visit the stall as it might take longer than usual beverage store, but trust me itâ€™s worth it!

Will totally come again ðŸ©·",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107831344439866520803/reviews
June O,5,I was joyful when I arrived at 12noon on a Thursday and the queue was short. I was the 4th in the line. Got myself the salted gula melaka foam matcha in regular size which I regret after. Make sure you get yourself the large size of any drinks when ordering ðŸ˜‰,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106561741135049100161/reviews
