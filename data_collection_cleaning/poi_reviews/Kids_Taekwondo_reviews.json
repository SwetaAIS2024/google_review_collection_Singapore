      "text": "My 8yo son has been with Kids Taekwondo for 3 years now and he thoroughly enjoys himself during every lesson. Not only does he love his mates, Master Lee is also a very patient  personal Taekwondo instructor. He teaches disciple to his students in a friendly way and everyone enjoys interacting with him.\n\nLocation wise, the centre is smack in the middle of great food joints. It is also pretty convenient for parents to park around the area. Parents can go for coffee nearby or have a meal while waiting for the kids. Highly recommended.\n\nMaster Lee also organises activities such as Korea Day where students and families are invited over for homemade Korean treats and a movie screening during school holidays.\n\nClass fees are reasonable/affordable and grading sessions are professional and well prepped. Students are handed cute point vouchers after each class to accumulate in exchange for Taekwondo gears.\n\nHighly recommended!!!",
