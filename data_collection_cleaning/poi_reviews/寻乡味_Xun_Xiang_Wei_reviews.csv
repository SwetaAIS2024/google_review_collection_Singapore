Matthias Chua,5,"Located in Rong Fa Coffee Shop.

Price: $4.50 (Lei Cha Brown Rice)

The ingredients of the Lei Cha (Thunder Tea Rice) includes fried bean curd, sweet chye poh (preserved radish bits), long beans, stir fried cabbage, mani cai (sweet leaf), chye sim, toasted peanuts and ikan bilis (dried anchovies). Tea soup is basil based and is quite savoury.

Loved the addition of the ikan bilis which provides more crunch and savouriness.

Came at around 12 and was served immediately.
