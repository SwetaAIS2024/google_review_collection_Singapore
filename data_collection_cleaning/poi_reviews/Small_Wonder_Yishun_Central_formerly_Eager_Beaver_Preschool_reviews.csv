Len Tan,1,"I have a long story to tell and my conclusion is sending any kids to this centre is as good as sending them to a cold prison, cut off from family and relatives. Your child might pick up independence BUT along with indifference in such an inflexible centre that enforces 'military like' rules. Come on, spare those young minds. They need a healthy heart and mind to grow up. This is the first time I witness such a indifferent childcare centre and it's scary to imagine how a young child would be negatively affected seeing how some adults there behave and how rules are being enforced there. To give u some examples of their way of managing the centre:no visitors other than parents allowed(not even for a young kid who needs much adjustment to the new environment. Even parents, the director Sharon told me strictly 3visits per week allowed), cold attitudes towards visitors including grand parents, young sister of the child and caregivers. All parents and caregivers, when you hear your child crying for help in such a centre by behaving strangely at home after school, who could you ask for help from? I bet no one other than to rethink your decision to send your child there coz I believe there are many better ones out there. Much better ones.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109680804661061241072/reviews
