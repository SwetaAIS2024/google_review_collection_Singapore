S Y,5,Good option for food delivery. My mum & I ordered their customisable Poke Bowls many times before. My mum also likes their Spicy Salmon Udon & Sides such as Chuka Wakame & Spicy Yum. The Truffle Cold Somen with Hotate is good too.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114569231582940756419/reviews
William Lu,4,"Went to on Tai Seng Centre and looking for restaurant to eat. Saw this shop selling Japanese food and tried their chicken katsu curry don. It was good. Wanted their beef truffles, it was $15.9, it was quite expensive though, maybe next time will try this dish here.

Place isn't big but not much crowd  here though.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
raphael,5,Great pricing and for the quality and freshness well deserves the 5 stars. Located in a well hidden industrial building you will need to be intentional in seeking this place out but rest assured you'll be rewarded with some of the tastiest mentai salmon and pork jowl dishes. They have fresh sashimi too! Well worth a visit or two or three! When u are in the area.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117982606135566163743/reviews
Zi Lei Hung,5,"My favourite hidden gem at Tai Seng! It really is quite hidden at the 2nd floor of an office building. Obviously you can tell I love this place because I have 5 photos of the poké bowl from different occasions (and many more I ate but didn’t take photos of). It’s operated by a group of Thai women and so they offer this sauce called spicy yum, which is the green stuff you see in the photos. I believe it’s the Thai seafood sauce made of basil, mint, chilli and other good stuff. Love!!!

Salad bowls start at $7.90, poké bowls are $11.90 and $15.90 for one and two salmon/tuna topping respectively. Usually “premium” toppings like tobiko, jellyfish or onsen egg are NOT charged extra.

Also great service and very receptive to BYO, although the salad dressing always comes prepackaged in a small plastic container so I ask them to pour it in directly sometimes.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103385304738841936099/reviews
