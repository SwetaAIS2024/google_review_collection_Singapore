Nutty Nacho,2,"This school is absolutely rubbish. The school keeps on complaining, on how the IB scores are so low in Singapore. As the school does not want you to prepare for higher level grade questions, no wonder why. Also, hiring teachers based on degrees for something specific and then putting them in subjects that they don't have a specific degree in, is extremely stupid, have never seen a school do these types of actions. Forgot to mention that they don't improve school facilities, despite having a lot of money. If you are signing up your child for sports, is great. As they have good sports programs. But good luck getting support from the teachers and school, as they have zero support for their athletes.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101285812003701499677/reviews
Raoul,5,"GESS has two sections: an IB and a German section. Our kids are in the German section (2nd grade and Kindergarten) so that this review focuses on that.
I myself attended a German school as a kid so I am familiar with the perks of a private school, but GESS just brings this to another level. Honestly speaking the school has surpassed all of our expectations. The facilities are world class, the teachers are amazing and the support is tremendous. Kids are very active with multiple playgrounds, lots of sports and art options and a general modern approach to education. Example: The school offered additional language support when our eldest was in K2 to get her German up to speed before primary school (she has never lived in Germany). So the teacher pro-actively reached out to us to see if we want them to help her with some additional 1 on 1 tutoring. She is completely fluent by now. Counselors are available and teachers give very open and direct feedback.

Kindergarten is also great – a very safe environment with a playground just for the pe-primary kids, lots of activities and a purpose built area for little ones. The truly love it. Sports, music, art etc. what else can you ask for.
Most importantly all 3 of our kids love the school – they really enjoy going and learning. The canteen is great as well.

One thing to note is that while the school seems huge – it does not feel too big for the kids. Pre-primary is an entirely separated area with it’s own playgrounds and eating area to ensure the little ones don’t feel overwhelmed when the bigger kids run around. For the older kids the school size becomes an advantage since it is easier to make friends in a larger school. So it works out perfectly. Lots of CCA, Sports teams etc to choose from.

The school is a non profit organization so school fees go to where they are needed.

Only negative aspect: Definitely not enough parking. But that’s ok. You can park on the street during pick-up and most kids take the busses anyway.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109582811597399068197/reviews
euromensch,5,Great school. Multicultural and multilingual. Excellent facilities (better than most schools in Singapore) and IB results. A number of students (including my daughter) have gone to great universities as a result of the excellent teachers at GESS. Highly recommended.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101222580667387841773/reviews
El pana Miguel,1,"Instead of improving educations, they put a new ultra big fan in the canteen for decoration that it doesn’t even works. The canteen food is very not worth the price and needs improvement. This school is scam. Very overpriced. Staff are not responsive and stupid.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107502677106515320493/reviews
Hani Suppi,5,"My daughter has been at GESS since her very first day of school, and now, as she’s about to graduate, we feel so lucky to have been part of this community. GESS has been more than just a school for her—it’s been a place where she’s built deep, lasting friendships and felt truly supported. The kindness and sense of belonging here have made all the difference in her life. I’m so grateful for the people and connections that GESS has brought into our lives. We see children who have graduated coming back to visit all the time.  Thankful for our time inSingapore and at GESS

Let me know if this feels right or if there’s anything else you’d like to add!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102017703293653859063/reviews
