Need to top up the card using another machine inside. But once you get used to it, will be ok. There is a small eatery here too.",

It’s shown on the board that they are selling fresh brewed coffee and I have feedback to the staff and she told me it is normal and that’s it. Therefore if not ready to provide charged coffee here, better don’t sell it. The staffs are mostly no available at the counter and have to press the bell to activated them. Maybe they are just making babies behind the counter? I hope they don’t.",

Needs ID, and it says valid for 5 years (website says membership is for lifetime, need to clarify)\nDiscount at 28.75% at the moment!\n\n2) Top-up card at the machine, minimum in card must be $20 to activate the pump. Using credit card to top-up, min $150 for the transaction. Nets, cash also available.\n\n3) Outside will have a grey machine. Place your card to activate the pump number.\n\n4) Pump as required, then head back to the grey machine to make payment.\n\nEasy! All made easy to the staffs that guide the customers along the way.",

Ouh and the petrol is cheappppp!! Definitely coming here again.",
