hunzie panzie,1,"Ordered at 1.05pm on 9th December. Was queuing for my turn. When it was my turn to order, I heard a lady stating ""next order"" but I thought it was the next stall auntie so I look back on my phone. As I was doing that, the hijabi auntie was rude and shouted ""ah play phone play phone"". I apologized and told her ""I thought it was the next stall auntie"". She proceeded to go back in and take a cloth to wipe the tray, to increase my wait time. She went back in, didnt wash her hand at all, proceeded to take my order, wore a glove on her right hand, and nothing on her left hand. She touched the noodle to serve me with both hands.

I wouldn't mind considering it's a hawker, but the very moment she was rude to her customer the first time, it was a no for me. Even the indian auntie at heritage stall witnessed the whole incident and shake her head at the poorly handled service.

Please educate your staff on proper manners and hygiene. Hawker or what, if you want a job, do it right. Don't project your emotions to others.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117207222560359927565/reviews
Md Azree Akbar,1,"LOUSY SHOP CHEAT PEOPLE MONEY
Made an advance order in Grab app for their Premium Fried Fish Soup with Rice set meal & even added extra rice & fish but all I received was just the normal portion. To make it even worst, they didn't even give me the XL fish cake which suppose to come with the set meal. Even got my drinks wrong, chose Chrysanthemum tea but got Ice Lemon tea instead. Plus no chilli was given, the soup taste so bland without chilli. Really lousy shop.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117598291725141244348/reviews
