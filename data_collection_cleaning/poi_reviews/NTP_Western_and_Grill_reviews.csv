Derold Ee,1,"Worst behavior and attitude!!!

Ordered steak and aglio olio to dine in.  Instead, they packed it up so as to charge extra for the packaging.  Refused to acknowledge mistake and even rolled eyes when confronted.

Steak was rubber.  Aglio Olio overcooked and bland.  Badly frozen and salted fried wings.  The only western store here though, if you were desperate enough",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105824573215356469977/reviews
