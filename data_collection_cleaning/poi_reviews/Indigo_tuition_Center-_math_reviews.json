For myself, even though I started his tuition with a single digit score, he was always more than happy to guide me through questions and ensure that i understood my mistakes. He is also like a buddy to me, therefore his lessons were always very comfortable and enjoyable ! I am super thankful to have him as a tuition teacher and helping me regain my confidence in math !",

The way he teaches is in depth but yet easy to understand, making learning that much efficient and faster. Outside of class, Mr Peng cares for our well being and ensures we are coping well with our life, even more so than our school teachers. He has been a fantastic role model and an even better teacher. Without his guidance and teachings, it would have been difficult to score in my exams.",
