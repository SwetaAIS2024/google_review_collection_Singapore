      "text": "One of the best places to have salmon sashimi without breaking the bank. They have a promotion every Mondays and Thursdays where one portion of sashimi (5 slices) is 3.90++. Although the size of the sashimi slices have become smaller over the years due to inflation, it is still worth it to come here! They also have set meals that are very worth the money and promotions for sake and beer. If you're coming for the salmon promo, come early to avoid long queues. Also, they close pretty early, so come early to avoid disappointment!",

      "text": "Standing Sushi Bar at Odeon Towers offers a range of Japanese dishes, including sushi, sashimi, and robatayaki. While the menu features a variety of options, the pricing is on the higher side, with main courses ranging from approximately $16 to $27.  The quality of the food is generally acceptable, though it may not consistently meet the expectations set by the price point. For instance, the Chirashi bowl and mixed sashimi bowl have been noted for their quality, though some patrons feel the servings could be more generous.  The restaurant does offer promotions on certain days, such as discounted salmon sashimi on Mondays and Thursdays, which can provide better value for money.  However, outside of these promotions, the overall dining experience may not justify the higher costs for some customers. In summary, while Standing Sushi Bar provides a decent selection of Japanese cuisine, the combination of its pricing and food quality may not offer the best value compared to other options available in Singapore. ￼ ￼",
