Ribeye,3,"Curious about this celebrated bakery. Bakery Brera does decent quality pastries, though prices lean pricier (e.g., a small selection costs ~$20). The mini coconut kouign-amann ($4.50) stands out‚Äîbuttery, flaky, and richly layered‚Äîwhile the croissants were unremarkable, due to their lightness and delicate texture. The cheese scone, which felt overly dense and pasty in texture. Perhaps it was off peak or low turnover but the pastries were stale.

The compact shop is crowded with equipment, with limited indoor space and no sit-down area‚Äîthough a toaster is provided outside for self-heating purchases. Staff are friendly and welcoming. But overall not looking to revisit soon.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108129213100021627372/reviews
W Lee,3,"Great selection of bread, especially if you‚Äôre into sourdough ‚Äîthe variety and quality are genuinely impressive. Unfortunately, the experience at the storefront left a lot to be desired. The staff was quite rude and unhelpful when I asked questions, and I was given incorrect information. I specifically asked if the sourdough could be sliced, was told yes, and even bought two loaves based on that. Only when I reached the counter did they inform me they don‚Äôt slice sourdough at all.

Lovely bread, but the customer service needs serious improvement.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107289018857119978728/reviews
Ling Chen,1,"I do not understand what is the hype. The croissants are expensive and overrated - not flaky, not nice at all! The egg tart danish is also not nice with a thick layer of caramelised sugar. The dine in is not comfortable. I wonder if trays are washed for the next patron if I am expensive to use cutleries to eat from the tray! The plastic fork and knife was impossible to cut the chocolate croissant that was dry and hard.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104516159078972023073/reviews

Kaye Ng,1,"I had a bad experience.  A stale cake for Matcha Dark Chocolate cake.  The sponge cake is dry and flaky, $8.50.   The bakery should remove it from the shelf.  The Cashier girl kept checking her fingers although another assistant was helpful.  I wished he had told me the cake could be dated.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107899262609058196900/reviews
