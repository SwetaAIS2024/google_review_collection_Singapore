Elna Tan,4,"Brought a buyer to Seahill and was blown away by the breathtaking sea view it offers. There’s something special about waking up to the sight of the ocean—it brings a sense of calm that’s hard to replicate. The development itself is well laid out, with a mix of residential and SOHO units, offering flexibility for different lifestyles. It’s also close to West Coast Park and the coastline, making it perfect for nature lovers. A great choice for those seeking tranquil coastal living in the West!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115813988242309284143/reviews
Laven Loo PropNex,2,"Quiet place , with sea view facing at level 5. More than 2 pools in this condo. Very interesting layout with high ceiling like SOHO. The only interesting part is that it comes with screens at the balcony.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107726440411329069223/reviews
Othellin Markov,5,"Nice and professional BBQ area, by the pools. The cooking hub has equipped fridge and non-charcoal grill oven, easy to use and easy to clean. Having a cup of wine in the breeze, and a plate of grilled beef or seafood, what else?",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105235957145300195689/reviews
Vikas,5,"Good:

1. Located on the West Coast Highway. Cannot complain about road connectivity.

2. Three Bus stops:

A.  Bus stop 17369 right at the foot of the condo. It serves bus routes 175, 176 going towards Haw Par Villa.

https://maps.app.goo.gl/U3e1SgcXiu7fCc9j8

B. Bus stop 17081 across West Coast Link for bus  route 175 towards Clementi.

C. Bus stop 17361 across West Coast Highway for bus route 176 towards Juron East.

3.  Cross the highway to reach West Coast Park. It has level playing field / open air theater at the center for events.  Walk along a small coastline with excellent sunset views.
4. The Park has a McDonald's outlet if you want to carb up.
5. The condo has three big swimming pools and multiple small ones.

a. Largest one on floor 1.
b. Second one on floor 6.
c. Infinity pool on floor 24.

6. Floor-24 also has a small gym and a tennis court. Excellent views of the port from here.
7. West Coast Park separates coastline from the condo. No future construction possible to obstruct coastline views.
8. Edit Jan-2024: With West Coast Parkview HDB open across the streer, expect more shops to open nearby. A 7-Eleven is already open.

Bad:

1. Nearest MRT station, Haw Par Villa a few bus stops away.
2. Sheng Siong and Hawker center are about 10 minutes walk away.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101905033524146898852/reviews
Kok Jun Wei Jake,5,"Been living at a loft unit here for over 1 year. It's facing the pool and quiet since the highway is on the other side.

The layout is space efficient with well thought out storage designs from the developer and superb quality.

Very comfortable living for 1 or 2 persons. Takes me 16 - 18 mins to drive to cbd via the highway that's right behind.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115167578100524748907/reviews
