Victor HTL,4,"Ok overall their wanton charsiew noodles was really good, but if you see the charsiew closely, there is a huge layer of fat, white unrendered fat taking up about 50% of the slice, so it was quite unpleasant, but the wanton was good, duck was good, sauce combination was good, their dumplings has prawn in them, so overall 4 stars, would have been 5 if their charsiew was of a different cut",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105722555913037451991/reviews
