mohd muzzy,4,"room was clean.
location was perfect ,near masjid khalid,perfect for muslims.
location also very near all the halal food options

for non muslims,there are alot of options too,bars and massage places.

the nearest mrt is 25minutes walk away.
paya lebar mrt.

rooms were small,really small. bed was perfect firmness and toilet was clean.
toilet had inbuilt filtered water tap seperately safe for drinking.

we took the room with window although the view wasnt much, just a back alley view of the next building beside the hotel.

staff were so good.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104650637331448668253/reviews
Livia Nathania,2,"Room was so moist and moldy with no proper circulation to the point that we woke up feeling sick the morning afte we slept here for a night (congested nose, coughing). Soundproofing was really bad too. We were woken up by another guest checking in to a room near ours past midnight, they were shouting for whatever reason and we couldn’t go back to sleep for a while.

The location was great (walking distance if you want to roam around Joo Chiat area) and the lobby looked nice, but apart from that, everything else was disappointing. I wouldn’t come back and wouldn’t recommend anyone to stay here.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102595972234377065662/reviews
Benjamin Lee,4,"Comfortable and clean rooms with a great location.

Receptionist seems to have an attitude problem though. Sour expression most of the time with a rude and condescending attitude.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111028080937628927186/reviews
อิสรีย์ ศุภเลิศจารุภัทร์,4,"The room is good, but the new hotel rule is that only the real passport is required. No photo or other forms of identification can be shown, making it inconvenient for a sudden stay",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102772267203022816018/reviews
Balaganesh Krishnamoorthy,4,"We booked the room for price 80 SGD, short time. Rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny in ground floor. Its solved the purpose. may be other floor rooms are little bigger but not sure.

overall its cheap and best for bachelors.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103059570997382261430/reviews
