The vegetables and egg were very delicious, complementing the meal.\n\nI bought the Japanese curry chicken and the five spices chicken after class, and again, they were incredibly delectable. My favourite has to be the grilled rendang!\n\nAs they are moving soon, I hope that the new location will love and support the wonderful staff and food too.",

      "text": "I love Kunyah. Their highlight is definitely their rendang dishes.\n\nThe vegetables used to be sweet, crunchy and moist. Really good combination. However, the vegetables are a little less flavourful now.\n\nThe grilled chicken could be grilled to a higher level of crispness but it’s standard has mostly kept up. Definitely a highlight and must try.\n\nThe rice is also decent. I can somewhat taste the coconut in it. However it also used to be stronger in flavour. Perhaps less rice and more flavour would go a long way.\n\nThe egg is alright but I feel that focus should be on the chicken and veg which are the best part of this set.\n\nAt $6.80 it’s a value for money set. If the quality control is better it would be perfect!",

Rendang sauce is flavorful and tempeh was hot and crispy. Noodles were of the right consistency.\n\nService staff are all very friendly!\n\nCome and support our differently-abled chefs - enjoy the food and support the team at the same time!",

Side vege was okay, slightly overcooked. Portion was good and reasonably priced. All for the good cause. Will be back to try the sandwich.",
