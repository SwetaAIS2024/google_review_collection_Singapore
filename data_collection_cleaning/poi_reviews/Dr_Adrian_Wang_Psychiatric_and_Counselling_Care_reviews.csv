His professional recommendations were delivered with careful word choice, and he took the time to explain relevant concepts and address my questions thoroughly.

aditi brandon,5,"As someone who has been through the public system and a couple other psychiatrists, I have to say that Doctor Adrian is a wonderful psychiatrist who is consummate professional, prompt and understanding.

I began seeing him in December of 2022 and he was very clear in his explanations for my condition as well as the medications and treatment options that I should explore.

Throughout the time I have seen Dr Adrian, my condition has improved and i've also come to realise what is necessary for my mental health with my condition, both of which have positively impacted my quality of life. Every appointment was useful and informative for me.

I highly recommend anyone who needs to see a psychiatrist to see Doctor Adrian at their earliest convenience.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114879406403168106787/reviews

I am glad I saw this doctor based on my friend's recommendation - I have likewise been recommending him to other friends as well.
