      "text": "I have been to this place before a few times. It was a guy with specs who was the barrister. He made fantastic coffee. The coffee beans they have is really nice. Taste of coffee is good.\n\nBut this visit today, not only the coffee tasted thin, the staff also had terrible attitude. The spec guy was gone. There were 2 young gals manning the counter with an older female whom I tink is the manager.\n\nI was at the side looking at the menu as it was previously where I had ordered before. I did not realise the cashier had changed to face the front.\n\nI asked a qn and was told by 2 young gals chatting at a corner to come over to the cashier to ask the qn.\n\nI am not buying the drink as yet. I tink as service staff, it would be polite to come over and answer the qn than to rudely ask the customer to head over to the cashier just so you don‚Äôt have to walk.\n\nMind you, the place was empty except for 2 customers sitting and having their drinks. The staff were not doing anything.\n\nThankfully the older staff came over to speak with me. She might have been the manager perhaps. After answering my qn, she politely advised that the payment machines were at the front therefore I would need to proceed to the front to make my order.\n\nAt the cashier, I told the staff that the least she could do was to answer my qn first as I was not placing any orders. And her reply was ‚Äúwhat?!‚Äù\n\nSuch rude people should never be employed in the service line. I‚Äôm sure she was very happy just chatting away with her colleague before I rudely interrupted their chat.\n\nThe manager was at the side on her laptop. I had stood there for quite awhile before I asked my qn.\n\nObviously no one was interested in sales or retaining the clients.\n\nReally unfortunate for the boss.",
