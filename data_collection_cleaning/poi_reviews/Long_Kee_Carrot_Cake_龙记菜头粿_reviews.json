Now, let me tell you, this carrot cake isn't your average Joe - it's a culinary rollercoaster; you either love it or you're, well, wrong!\n\nThis dish is like a rebel in the world of carrot cakes.

It's like a surprise party for your palate. You'll find yourself savoring every bite, wondering what unexpected flavor twist is coming next. It's like a delicious mystery novel you can eat.\n\nSo, if you're up for a foodie adventure and don't mind your carrot cake being a little rebellious, give Long Kee Carrot Cake a try. Who knew that a dish so simple could be so polarizing and so amusing? It's the perfect way to add some excitement to your culinary escapades!",

      "text": "This is by far my favourite fried carrot cake stall that I've patronised for decades. It's just different from any other typical and regular carrot cake which I believe auntie has her secret recipe to it :) Eggs are generous, the way I like it. Just be prepared to queue for it, especially on weekends.\n\nUpdate 2May22: pricing has increased across the board by 50cts which is evident across most hawkers due to increasing price in rae material. Still, Long Kee Carrot Cake still retain its top position as my favourite carrot cake :)",
