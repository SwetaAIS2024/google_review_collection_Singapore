- “‪沧桑大叔‬” -,4,"Craving lamb soup, I searched for a well-reviewed place nearby and drove over 20 minutes to get there. I arrived at 11:20, 10 minutes before opening, and saw the owner busy inside. After waiting another 20 minutes, the restaurant opened, and I went up to order, only to be told that phone orders were fully booked until 2:30 p.m. The owner kindly said that since I only wanted a portion of lamb ribs, she’d try to serve me if possible. After waiting another 10 minutes, she brought out a bowl of lamb ribs. To be honest, the taste was good, but if you don’t like waiting too long, make sure to call ahead.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116613727227120618451/reviews
Keith Lim,5,"You can smell the gaminess when heading towards the store. Mutton is tender and portion generous. Soup is not overly herbal nor sweet. Smooth and just the right taste for me.
Standard condiments are garlic/vinegar and chilli sauce. I like former better.
Ordered item#4 the mixed variety @ $7.50. Think it's very reasonable given the taste and portion.
Will certainly be back.
* Was there about 330pm on a Sunday. 8 queue numbers ahead of me. Waited 15min or so which wasn't too bad. You can feel they do indeed put in effort to prepare your order.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118148161428860261466/reviews
A3 K8,1,"Wonder why the queue is so long? So decided to try. Surprise the food is so so only. You can get many better mutton soup in Sg. So why the queue so long. Upon investigating, you realised it is a marketing gimmick. Make the wait long by being slow. Even if there is no customers, they will tell you 1 hour await. Oldest trick in town but many people falls for it looking the reviews. If it is good the queue must be long. If the queue is long, the food must be good. One question, why is the soup only $6.50 if it is good when the one in Changi village can sell $12.50 in the middle of no where.  Counted 7 tables waiting for food. 1 hr divided by 7 customers. What a scam!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117065196854160529320/reviews
Bli Leong,5,"Waited 1 hour at 4.30pm on Wednesday afternoon. Don't get a chance to watch and understand why it took so long to serve. No complain though, the meats were soft and tender. This is more like a Malay-Chinese fusion as I tasted more spices than Chinese herbs. Worth a try if you have time to spare.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118197187270625470744/reviews
KC Go,5,"Famous for waiting long time to get your food, you don’t see the queue, but it’s called by number.
The meat is very good very tender worth to make a try",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113085314295831061614/reviews
