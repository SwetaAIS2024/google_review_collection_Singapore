Daniel McIntyre,5,"This is wonderful, deep museum, a must see for people with an interest in history. It costs S€25, which if you are like me, and want to learn about history and local culture in a new place you visit, is totally worth it. I’ll always remember my experience in this museum, for the ethnic Chinese that came to Singapore since the early 19th century, and the evolution of Singapore history and economic development. Also, thank you to the woman 老板 on the front desk for being so nice to talk to.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110077344912406169872/reviews
Solo Kate,4,"Good museum, but very strange way of going into exhibition: you need to leave 50 sgd deposit in cash (even you can buy tickets only strictly online) and then they give you an electronic card/key to open door to the exhibition. Unbelievable combo for 21 century:)",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103392223968841130378/reviews
playpretend 1818,5,"Sign to warn people to not enter the construction site in multiple langauges. (Construction site located next to Chinese Heritage Centre)
Languages used included English, Mandarin, Malay, Tamil, Bengali and Korean, which is more than the usual 4 local languages seen on most construction signs in Singapore. This could be due to NTU having many international students who may have first languages other than the 4 languages typically found on such signs. The order of the languages could be due to how many people understand it - English as first language for most, whereas Korean as a first language for least number of people. However, the fact that there are additional languages (on top of the typical 4) means that the number of people who use these 2 other languages is still significant enough such that they decided to add it in the sign.
Written in all caps to capture people's attention and in red to suggest urgency, as trespassing could result in serious danger.
Emplacement system - sign positioned on a barrier, to emphasis the existence of the barrier, which is to prevent people from entering the construction site, which is dangerous.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106766683192312614598/reviews
