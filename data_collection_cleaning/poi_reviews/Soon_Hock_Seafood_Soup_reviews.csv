Ojisan “Hiroshi”,4,"At first look, their Mee Hoon Kuey seems like nothing much.  I thought It was gonna be one of those waste $$$ just eat meals.

Their product proved me wrong. Soup was very good, Mee Hoon Kuey was “Al dente”.

Good for days when you want something light.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112623517876975514039/reviews
mike chua,5,One of the best mee hon gou in town.  Never ask her.  But can tell no msg.  Really hard to find.  Thin skin hand make.  Come all along from west. Hope my review don’t put the queue too long.  Keep up the quality. 👌好吃😋,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106998119914155534820/reviews
