Strongly suggest the boss to change a chef.\nWhen complaint to the staff, show no remorse, didn‚Äôt even apologize. Just change another portion but also not nice. Strongly not recommended. Will not patronize again.",

Food was not bad, though some of them were a little too salty. The chicken satay was tender and flavourful, though it does not have as strong a chargrill taste.\n\nFood is a little on the pricer side.",

      "text": "One of the best lamb shank bbq (charcoal grilled) that is operated by Chinese from mainland. The flavour is typically of XingJiang style as the dry rubs used are full of spices and chilli powder. The meat are tender and juicy but anticipated to be heaty if consumed just solely grilled meat hence we ordered their cold dishes. The cucumber salad is especially good and the bean curd ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù( I believe it‚Äôs by the expert hand cut of the chef). The most attractive offer here is the Chinese imported beers with lots of variety. We kept with the premium Tsingtao which is smoother and tastier. If unsure of what to order, just look around you and tell the waiter to mimic the neighboring table. Can‚Äôt go wrong here. Excellent place for drinking and the skewers are especially fitting when consumed with their cold beers. üëçüëç my verdict is a two thumbs up. Definitely coming back here again. Cheers",
