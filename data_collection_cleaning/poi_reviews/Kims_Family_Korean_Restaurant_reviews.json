Just nice and flavourful old school type of dinning.\n\nFill your tables with lots of  Appetizers as usual.\n\nThen came the draft Makgeolli with the kettle. Try it this way.\n\nMeat goes by the size. If you can eat go ahead if not just order a single portion.\n\nThey will cook for you. You just eat.\n\nThe return crowd is amazing and the staff is friendliest.\n\nAlthough there are 25 Korean restaurants nearby. Trust me. This one is the best.",

Good variety of Banchan, we enjoyed the seafood soup and the chive pancake was great. Staff were attentive and kept refilling our ice when they realized we wanted ice with our water.",

I tried my dad's favourite dish here called 돼지국밥 (Korean Pork Bone Soup), which is a signature dish in Busan, and my dad said that this restaurant's 돼지국밥 has the most authentic taste he has tried in Singapore. And I enjoyed it too!\n\nThe BBQ options may be expensive as for all the K-BBQs, but their soup options are affordable with plenty of side dishes (반찬). Recommended",

There were complimentary cut fruits and yakult after the meal. The best was in fact the banchan and they were refillable as well.",
