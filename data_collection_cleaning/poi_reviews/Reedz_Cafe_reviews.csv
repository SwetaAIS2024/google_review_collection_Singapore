Andy Andy,3,"Build your own pasta/rice/salad; it has nothing really special.

The ingredients are limited - not all the main proteins listed are available, then choose 4 out of 9 toppings. The options can get quite odd to go with pasta like peanuts, cucumber, corn, and boiled eggs. The serving size can be rather small.

The place is clean, spacious, and comfortable.

Vegetarian option available.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105676099555784742093/reviews
M C,1,Impatient elderly service staff. Overpriced and horror tasting pre-packed bento. Lunch can only be served strictly from 11am (not even a second earlier!) with the staff standing around watching the clock on their handphone to strike 11am before they can proceed to take order. A really strange practice.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112656057492527518686/reviews
Faris,5,"Friendly service from staff. Accommodating with order change and good service even she has difficulty speaking.

Will come in the morning for coffee moving forward.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109663562292150355392/reviews
Mel Elissa,1,"Every single staff was rude and impatient even when there are not much customers they were screaming at their customers just because they don’t understand english.

If you are unhappy with your job and unwilling to serve customers then quit? Very insincere staffs. Also the food sucks, it made me sick i guess they do not practice food hygiene properly.

Please don’t waste your time and money here only to be served with disrespect and food that only makes you get food poisoning lol.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106476133040652829255/reviews
K Emika,1,"Bad service, food tasted disgusting and drinks are below subpar. We hope u will close down and open kopitiam.

Future customers, we hope you are okay with soggy waffles which takes 10-12mins, tasteless pasta, inconsistent coffee (could be lukewarm/taste/look weird). If you’re not then please don’t waste a minute or a single penny here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108943962104897324883/reviews
