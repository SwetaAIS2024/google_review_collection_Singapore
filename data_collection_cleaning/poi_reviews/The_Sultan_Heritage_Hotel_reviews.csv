Mohammad Bashiri,5,"I stayed at The Sultan in Singapore for 7 nights and had a great experience. The staff were always available, polite, and very helpful throughout my stay. Room service was prompt and of high quality. The room itself was comfortable and well worth the price. The location was excellent—central, convenient, and close to everything I needed. Overall, a pleasant and smooth stay—I’d gladly return.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110360383871330145318/reviews
Aaron Pruss,5,"Thank you for having us. The loft room was great for our family stay. The location is great, the hotel is immaculate and has everything we needed. A walk to street food / markets or to bus and train stops. We flew in early and flew out late - and the customer service was fantastic allowing early check in and late check out. I’ll be recommending to any friends/family visiting Singapore.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110373178845230080765/reviews
Anjan Santra,3,"A Misnomer for Hospitality: The Sultan

The Sultan prides itself on its grand name, but sadly, it falters in delivering even basic hospitality, especially considering the prices it charges. Despite catering to international tourists, the hotel shockingly lacks a functional first-aid kit. During our stay, a group of family and friends spread across three rooms, one of the children sustained an injury. When we requested first aid, the staff handed us nothing more than a box of tissue papers.

Upon our arrival, it was raining, yet the staff didn’t exhibit the courtesy to hold the door open. This lack of attention to small yet meaningful gestures only further emphasized how “The Sultan” fails to live up to its regal title.

The reality of the rooms was equally disappointing. The photos advertised online were misleading. For instance, the so-called ""loft room"" is practically a safety hazard a steep staircase leads to the bed, while the bathroom remains on the ground level. The ground floor features an uncomfortable sofa, falsely marketed as an additional bed.

Adding to the grievances, the hotel charged a (refundable) $50 security deposit per room despite our full advance payment. To top it all off, the washrooms lack bidets, an essential feature for many travelers.

In summary, “The Sultan” offers an experience that’s far from majestic. This is one hotel that’s easy to skip.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108469456859070868053/reviews
Krishna Prasad,2,"Great staff.

They ask $50 deposit even if we prepaid for full length of stay.

There was no functional first aid kit.

Pantry items were complimentary, but, they charge to refill.

No restaurant, so no breakfast. Also, no kitchen too.

Loft room is not safe for any because of very narrow steps leads to main bed and toilet at ground level. How can one design such a room costing $250?

Narrow passages and noisy room, no sound proofing at all.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107095010083969235981/reviews
Mac Jur,5,"Rooms on the small side by European standards , but I guess it's big for Singapore and you find everything you will find in a good hotel room, as per description. Amazing service, fantastic location. If I come to Singapore again I will book this hotel without hesitation.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111077699590932733087/reviews
