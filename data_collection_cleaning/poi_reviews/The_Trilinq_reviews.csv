Ho Siow Ping,5,"The recent renovations have indeed made the place look nicer.
4 swimming pools and lots of space for cycling and jogging. How many condos can offer these?
There are ongoing paintings and refurnisments, so the place would look much nicer soon. Stay tune!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104907511039979860884/reviews

James Chan,5,"Very convenient. Bus stops nearby, a 5 minute walk to Clementi Mall and Clementi MRT station. Clementi Police HQ and Fire Station nearby, Clementi Town sec and Nan Hua Pri are  around the area. Facilities are alright, many pools for different ages and activities. Nice view",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106455941066960036122/reviews
Laven Loo PropNex,4,"Dropped by few times. Literally mind blowing when I was welcomed by the grand lobby with full high ceiling. Facilities are full especially the special pirate ship playground. Interesting fact 4th, 14th and 24th have their own open concept area to chill. Breathtaking views. The maintenance of the facilities is nicely done. Maintenance fee is acceptable too. Direct bus to Woodlands, Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang, Eunos and Clementi MRT.

SL M,4,"Big place, nice location in the heart of Clementi, near NUSH, Nanhua and Clementi MRT. Definitely a good place to live in. The only drawback is that the pricing is unreasonable for a higher ceiling. Hopefully it will be adjusted.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100038477702587830233/reviews
