Only order unless u can wait, only 1 chef and 1 doing cashier and prepping ingredients. We waited closed to 25 minutes for our mala, and there wasn‚Äôt queue. Recommend to try the ÁÇñÊ±§ stall or Thai food stall, reasonably priced and food is good.",

We also ordered the herbal black chicken which was excellent with soft and tender meat. The lady attending the stall was also super friendly and kind. She even offered me a pair of chopsticks after seeing mine dropped üòÇ Glad to find such a gem here!",
