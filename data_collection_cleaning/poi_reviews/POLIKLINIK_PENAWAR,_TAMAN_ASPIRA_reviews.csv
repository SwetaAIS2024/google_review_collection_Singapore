Ain Mardiah,5,"The consultation was short and dense with very thorough explanation. I appreciate how they explained and narrowed down my symptoms to find the actual cause of my sickness, which to my surprise is actually correct and is applicable to my situation. Kudos to the Dr!

Location and the place itself is good, easy to find parking and very hygienic. Not so many people also, meaning short waiting time (which is great for people who are in pain). Definitely recommend this clinic ☺️",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116652529026390433812/reviews

A Heartfelt Thank You to Dr. Bakhtiar

I just want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Bakhtiar for his exceptional care and thorough examination of my child. From the moment we stepped into his clinic, his attention to detail something i really amazed.

He didn’t just rush through the consultation—he took the time to listen carefully, assess every aspect of my child’s condition, and explain everything in a way that was easy to understand. His dedication and expertise gave us so much reassurance, and we left knowing our child was in the best hands possible.

Doctors like him truly make a difference, and we are incredibly thankful for his kindness and professionalism. May he continue to be a blessing to many more families!
