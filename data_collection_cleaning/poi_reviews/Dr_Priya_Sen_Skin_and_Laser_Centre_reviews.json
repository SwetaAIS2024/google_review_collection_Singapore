      "text": "Chose Dr. Priya several years ago for my Accutane treatment, and I couldn't be more grateful for her expertise. Thanks to her guidance, my acne is now under control, and my skin looks the best it ever has. New friends are often surprised when I show them photos of my skin before treatment‚Äîit's hard to believe how much it‚Äôs improved!\n\nMost recently, Dr. Priya helped me with a cyst that developed on my body. As always, she was professional and provided effective treatment that brought me relief quickly. The cyst has now healed fully and is no longer on my mind.\n\nI have also used her face moisturiser as well ever since my first visit. It works well for my skin!\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Priya to anyone struggling with skin issues. She‚Äôs someone you can trust to provide personalised, effective care.",

I have struggled with hair loss for some time and tried so many things. After I started taking these tablets, it‚Äôs the first time that my hair has actually stopped dropping. I don‚Äôt know how those pills worked their magic, but I am so very grateful!",
