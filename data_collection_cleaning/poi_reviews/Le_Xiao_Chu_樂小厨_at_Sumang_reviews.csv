The Genesis Family,5,"The rice in broth, 泡饭is nice! It's not always available, do enquire for its availability.

If you order from them, you get to seat at the big round tables specially reserved for their customer.

For the sambal smelly bean w prawns, there's only two small shrimp inside.  The sambal Petai is nice if you are craving, this come w rice and it's cheaper.

Salted vegetables soup is not nice, tasted weird, too much Chinese wine maybe. Usually salted vegetables soup don't go wrong but at this place, it's not nice. Don't order, try other soup instead.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114071894759795666732/reviews
Ken Lee,5,"If you loved Charcoal  steamboat and knows that it just taste different, you are right! Now, if you stay in the Northeast Punggol, fret not - there is a good place for fish steamboat you can try. The soup has good flavor and is refillable, you just need to ask for it if they are too busy. We also loved the stir fried beef noodle which has lot of wok hei. Can't stop once you start.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100792161459528850818/reviews
