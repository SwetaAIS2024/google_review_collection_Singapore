L,1,"RUBBISH shop, the drink cost $3.30, and there was a 20cents extra surcharge for using NETS that i wasn’t aware of, counter lady did not even inform me nor tell me beforehand there’s a NETS surcharge. if i was informed i would have paid with cash instead. but no, the cashier took the receipt after i paid and promptly threw it away before i could ask for it, and it was only because i reconfirmed the price she sheepishly told me there’s an extra charge. Scummy shop DO NOT SUPPORT SUCH SHOPS. No sign whatsoever, and she even expected me to know there would be a surcharge.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112052566181205039985/reviews
Sharon,1,"Very terrible. They sold expired kids snacks! My son ate it then told me the taste s wired then I found the expired date is on 2019 December. I brought back and talked to the counter auntie then she shouted to the staff said, it’s 2nd pack that customer return. I asked for refund but the auntie refused and asked me to exchange. I had no mood to continue buying anything from the store. But she gave me the excuse s “GST Keyes in, can’t refund.” It’s nonsense. They did wrong and still refuse to satisfied customer s request. It’s really bad!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111629994602297254261/reviews

Charles Tan,4,"This mini mart has been since my semi-childhood-teenager times. Those days named as E-com minimart in 1980s . Nowadays,their prices are not so  competitive at all partly due to NTU.. fai......
