Tee Yongnan,5,"If you’re a seafood lover and you enjoy a good kick of spice, the Spicy Ah Gong Koka Noodles at this stall are going to blow your mind.

From the first sip of the broth, I knew I was in for something special. It’s spicy, yes, but not in a way that just burns your mouth—it’s a deep, layered spice that works harmoniously with the rich, umami-packed seafood base.

The seafood here is simply phenomenal. The prawns are fresh, plump, succulent, and naturally sweet. They’re cooked to perfection, with a slight snap when you bite into them. The sotong (squid) is equally impressive, tender and not the least bit rubbery.

But the thick fish slices are what truly elevate this dish. They’re fresh and flaky, soaking up the spicy broth like a sponge. Every bite of fish feels luxurious, like something you’d expect in a high-end restaurant rather than a humble hawker stall. And let’s not forget the small clams! These little treasures are fresh and juicy, releasing their natural briny sweetness into the broth. They add a delicate seafood flavor that ties everything together perfectly.

The noodles are the perfect vehicle for all this goodness—springy, bouncy, and never soggy. They absorb just enough of the broth to be flavorful but still retain their own texture. The minced pork is a fantastic addition, adding a meaty, hearty contrast to the seafood. It comes with an egg already added and mixed which gives the soup base a creamy body.

The portion size is generous, and the price is reasonable for the quality and variety of ingredients. The queue can be long during peak hours, so I recommend going early, but even if you have to wait, it’s absolutely worth it.

I will definitely be back for another bowl. If you haven’t tried this yet, you’re seriously missing out!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103655670304784447170/reviews

June,4,"This is a stall which I’ve a love-hate relationship with. The food is not consistent but when it is good, it’s so addictive and yummy.

Sometimes noodles are too al dente, sometimes it’s perfect. Sometimes soup is only 3/4 of bowl. Sometimes spicy soup is too thick and viscous vs the normal version.

Still, I keep coming back despite the inconsistency and long queues and thus 5 stars!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105169174857655588987/reviews
Denise Lee,4,"I must say that overall the ingredients were tasty and generous. However, buying the larger bowl meant that there was lesser soup, and it was almost as though I was having dry noodles. Definitely seems like comfort food for those living nearby and I too would get it if I lived nearby. I suggest avoiding the crowd and coming during off peak timings. (Also so that they don't get your orders wrong like they did for mine)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100613858224644758681/reviews
