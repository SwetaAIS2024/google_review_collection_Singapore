E,3,"Came to this coffee shop to eat the mookata. It's a decent and pretty standard coffee shop. It has a wide variety of stalls. Interestingly enough, there were quite a few beer ladies around, way more than usual. When we sat down they came to ask if we wanted to order beer and did it several times too, very enthusiastic.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103665268796109855493/reviews

Personal Opinion,3,"Went and try their $2 coffee toast set. Encounter a very rude coffee stall uncle. Service is very poor, and bread very normal. Could go boon keng hawker for $3. Better service, egg is open for you... 😜",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111228628102261029573/reviews
Anson LJY,4,I have tried most of the food already I can say they are ok for the price but the breakfast set is damn worth. $2 for breakfast with a drink?!?! Anyday my guy.
