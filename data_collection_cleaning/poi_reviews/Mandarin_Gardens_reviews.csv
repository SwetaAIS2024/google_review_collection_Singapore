bananan yh (bananan),4,"Nice place. Have been living here for almost a year. Good facilities, a restaurant, gym, even a kinderharden and a supermarket. Kind of sad for the chinese restaurant to close down. Area looks kind of old but it has a nice feeling to it. It is big as well. Recommended to take a walk around the area to familiarise yourself with the area, so as to not get lost. Not very happy with alot of birds around my area but i have gotten use to it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109280232255255649572/reviews
