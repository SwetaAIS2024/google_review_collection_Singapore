Doctor Maria was very attentive to details and asked my opinion on prescription after explaining options (some other clinics like to give as much medicine as possible).  Online booking is efficient (you do get the timing you booked, doctor apologized for just 10 mins delay). Medicines are packed in a paper bag not a plastic bag which is so overly used in Singapore.",

I went for travel advisory i was seen by a new doctor who didn’t visit me, didn’t check my health records nor prior vaccination, she said you do like ur wife and charged us double price because it was 2 of us in the room… good i left kids at home, she would have charged for them too.
