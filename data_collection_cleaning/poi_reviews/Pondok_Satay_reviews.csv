Teck Lung Ng,5,The best mutton satay in Adam Road. I don't understand why someone rated 1 star for their minimum order policy; it's already written on their sign board menu. I always order their satay because they are delicious. Hope people can rate their food rather than not accommodating their request to have smaller orders. 5 stars for me any days!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114950321887495303131/reviews

First time ordering here.
Ordered mutton satay min 10 sticks priced at $0.90c per stick.

Returned 10 mins later to collect them.

Meat was marinated too sweet. Meat was slightly tough.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116788322544213433170/reviews
Lyn Cai,3,"Chicken satay is well marinated and tasty.

However, the seller was dishonest in that he gave us (14pcs out of the 15pcs ordered, order was taken correctly with correct written codes on the plate “C15”).
We also ordered 3pcs of chicken wings (min order). We later learnt that our order was raised to 4pcs without our knowledge.
It could be an honest mistake but I would suggest to be careful when buying from this stall. Check your order and the amount paid.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107853084419005618803/reviews
G Lim,1,Bad satay. Meat is tough and not charred. Sauce is watery and bland. No buzzer system - they will ask you to come back in 15 min.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109887127868720767656/reviews
Gw Ng,1,Ordered chicken wings and the first bite of it really disgusting. Chicken tasted sour. Did not even bite the flesh off and decided to threw all away.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113887980440151114032/reviews
