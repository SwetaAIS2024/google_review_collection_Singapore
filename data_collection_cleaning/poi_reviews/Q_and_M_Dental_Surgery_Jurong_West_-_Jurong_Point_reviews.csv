Evelyn Teoh,1,"Zero compassion during appointment making. Called up other nearby Jurong branches due to urgent review for my child and they were pleasant and showed patience in explaining that there were no child dentist at that moment. Suggested to contact JP branch and a robotic sounding receptionist picked up and repeated many times that they only takes in provided the child is able to sit through the session without crying etc (which I already told her I understand as my child is an existing Q&M patient). Explained the urgency of the matter and asked me which day am I looking at?! When I repeated myself that it is urgent and would it be possible for an urgent review on the same day, she said no and began raising her voice sounding like a broken record saying no walk in today. At that point I just decided to put down the call with the intention to write in this poor review requesting for your branch to do a review on your poor staff performance.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104853200254171024639/reviews

Mabel Tan,3,"Went for a routine check under IHP insurance coverage. Was asked to do some X-rays as I complained some sensitivity during the cleaning .
After screening by the dentist and suspected underlining issues due to root canal. However the dentist could not advise me further. I was asked to come back to see the root canal specialist and also tooth crowning under another specialists. The consultations for these 2 specialists are out from my own pockets . I understand the treatments are not covered but seeing a specialist to talk about the issues and treatment should be included . This is weird and my first time encountered . I guess the dentist who attended to my cleaning is junior doctor.  Future Will look for a senior dentist when making dental appointment",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102086233012125870405/reviews
Siti Norashimah,5,"i came for scaling and polishing with doctor Leong Jun Ni. The doctor was amazing, she calmly cleaned my tooth slowly, it doesnt hurt at all. I could tolerate it throughout the session. The doctor also advises on the proper way of brushing and flossing the teeth. All the nurses are very friendly and helpful. They are beautiful too! Highly recommend Q&M at JP! Will definitely come here again! Thank you! ðŸ¤—",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106603606879663005291/reviews
