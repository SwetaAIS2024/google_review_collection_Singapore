Yiling Lai,4,"Went to Pet Festival at Marina Bay Sand Convention Centre after that decided to look for a pet friendly restaurant. We found this Bella Pasta.. the service was good, and the food was nice, too, especially the pizza thin crust. Well, although some mistakes were on the food but the staff was nice to wavie off & offer to change. Staff seeing us with dogs also offer to provide some cold water for them. Will come again.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107732692035532187309/reviews
Hui Fen Chua,4,"Cosy quiet place that is great for celebration and chilling out after a busy work day.

White pizza seems very interesting and I love the one with shaved truffle and egg yolk. The one with honey looks good too which we would probably try it next round. The folded pizza was a little disappointing and I was expecting more out of it. Gnocchi is flooded with sauces and cheeses. It’s super chewy and definitely recommend!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108440859742107689991/reviews
