Ron,2,"I have been buying for almost a year and considered stopping to buy from this stall due to few issues.

Firstly, when take away eggplant cooked with onions, she gave onion slices more than the egg plant.

another issues today, when she told me the price of 1 Meat+2 veges ( Mei Chai+ ladies finger+ japan toufu)= SGD4.80, however, she lied by saying she told me incorrectly when I questioned her after she returned the change of SGD4.20 of SGD 10 and told me it was 5.80. So, I won't be bother to go anymore.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114528160073988258381/reviews
E,1,"Absolute scam!!! Avoid eating here above anything else. Ordered fried rice and additional toppings (meat, broccoli, egg) cost me $5.50. Okay, I thought price was decent because ai orderded quite abit. Until I digged into the food and realised the entire chicken chunk was infact just BONES and totally bare of meat. They have literally scrapped off all the meat in the chicken, yet they still dare to serve customers chicken bones and charge more than $5. There must be a reason why they only do takeaways. Itâ€™s because they know customers will immediately demand for a refund. Trust me. This eatery is garbage.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105461437088142587736/reviews

Ming Cheng,4,"Not sure why it's called Sky Thai because it's just your regular economical rice stall. They have a huge array of toppings to choose from and they are all pretty decent. For the ones looking for a cheap meal at JP, the usual Set A and Set B nasi lemak are available here too(Singaporeans will know what I'm talking about), albeit at $2.50 instead of the usual $2.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117988198545701601245/reviews
