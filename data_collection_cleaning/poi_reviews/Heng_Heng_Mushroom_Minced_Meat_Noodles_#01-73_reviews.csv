Mandy Ang,5,"Very tasty bowl and heartwarming bak Chor mee. I really like the service from the Auntie and the noodles are cooked al dente. If you love chilli like I do, additional chilli will give you the kick. And make the bowl of noodles more tasty too.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116982302857281297035/reviews
Terence Oh,4,"A taste of nostalgia!

I have become a regular of this Bak Chor Mee stall after discovering it not too long ago.

This nondescript stall in the middle of a busy hawker center is staffed by a few aunties who have been serving the same delicious traditional Bak Chor Mee for decades.  They take pride in doing things the old way - pork soup cooked for hours, properly braised mushroom, crispy lard bits, paired with noodles done with the right amount of bite, hand chopped Minced Meat, and fresh springy fish balls and meat balls.  Each bowl is a trip back to my childhood meals.

The char kway teow is worth a try, and the fish ball noodles are good too.

They may not have crowds queueing up like other internet famous stalls nearby, but expect good honest food.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100930612192424734569/reviews
Cheryl Lee,5,"Love it. Delicious and non pretentious. Super reasonable price. Simple stall and easily missed by people not in the know. I would sometimes drive all the way from Jurong just to eat this because cravings. Super hardworking old aunties making tasty Bak Chor Mee. Always accommodating to my many requests. Wah, thinking about it makes me feel like eating it again. Now.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105264212213589883276/reviews
