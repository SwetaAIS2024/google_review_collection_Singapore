      "text": "One of the better buffet lunch and dinner is served in this restaurant, located within the Roxy Mercure Hotel at Parkway Parade.\nThe two times I visited were for lunch. The spread is great, and the food is fresh. My personal favourites include the Satay, Laksa, Roast Beef, Prawns, Steamed Fish and especially the Durian Pengat.\nThe staff were efficient and friendly, and definitely made dining here a pleasant experience.\nIt's very good value for money if you're an Accor member. Getting here is easy as the Marine Parade MRT literally stops outside the hotel.",
