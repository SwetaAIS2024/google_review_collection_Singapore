However, there is only one restroom available.\n\nThe omakase set of eight costs $26 and comes in generous portions. The Kyoho grape beer, priced at $10, has a fruity taste. A variety of other alcoholic beverages are available, including unique cocktails that seem popular among diners.\n\nPleasant music plays in the background, enhancing the dining experience.",
