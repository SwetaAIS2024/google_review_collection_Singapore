I was very ill and had to be hospitalised for a week.\n\nEvery other GP was saying I have ‚Äúflu‚Äù or ‚Äúfever‚Äù but the doctors here knew something was up and didn‚Äôt dismiss my concerns.\n\nMost experiences I had with doctors in Singapore has been absolutely horrendous and honestly I could be a doctor myself at this point.\n\nBut the doctors here at Newest? Absolute lads!",

They are friendly and helpful with extended service to patients.\nThere was once while waiting in the clinic, I heard the receptionist asking if needed to write Chinese wording for the medicine as the patient is Chinese educated.\nWhile I would says, respects are gained through actions and mutually. Treats others as per how you want to be treated. \" Customers is always right\" when u respects the service provider.\nKeep it up team Newest Medical",

Left message on their business WhatsApp also never reply. Finally they answered my call this morning. I asked her why it‚Äôs so difficult to get hold of them and why they never read their WhatsApp. She said unapologetically ‚Äúbusy‚Äù ‚Äúno time to answer calls‚Äù. So when I told them what I need and want to make an appointment. She just said that they don‚Äôt take appointments, come down before 11am. So I told her I can‚Äôt make it and might have to go other clinics then, she said ‚Äúok, thank you‚Äù üò°",

The receptionist was efficient, and organized, making the check-in process smooth and quick. They answered all my questions with professionalism, setting a positive tone for my visit.\nDr Low Wymin was equally impressive, taking the time to thoroughly listen to my concerns and providing clear, thoughtful advice. I felt truly cared for by both the receptionist and the doctor. Their teamwork and commitment to patient care made my experience exceptional. Highly recommend this clinic!",
