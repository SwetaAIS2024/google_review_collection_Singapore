EveNah,4,"All these for just $7. Chicken rice was not bad, comes with grated ginger.  Pretty generous serving of chicken for the price.  Can't comment on wanton noodles because I didn't have that. Price has gone up in hawker centres and coffee shops but this stall is able to keep it at $3.50 for a plate of chicken rice. Stallholder is friendly. Will definitely be back to have more.

The coffee shop didn't separate the smokers' corner, it was smokey when we were there.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106592188085856343037/reviews
