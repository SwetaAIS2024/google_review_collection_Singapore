At this school, the kids don’t just go for getting education but also hone up life skills - this school takes the giant leap of faith and believe in their abilities to train the kids in baking such sumptuous, gourmet cookies, cakes (even eggless!!) and a whole gourmet of dishes that you just can’t stop at one!!\n\nAnd what surprised the most is the humility and gratitude that you witness from every single staff and students of this school. They truly believe in life-long learning and going extra mile to secure equal opportunity for kids with special abilities at par with any other kid. My best wishes for their noble endeavour.",
