      "text": "A grand theatre for shows and musicals.\nThe choices and variety of featured musicals are great. I have came to watch many musicals here.\nHowever, the management should make sure all audiences can view the whole props, casts and scenes.\nThere was a scene where I was very annoyed. I could not view what was going on. It was blocked by a hanging speaker. (I have highlighted in one of my photos). This was not the first time. Last visit during the sound of music, the casts were totally blocked by the curtains!\nAlso, the ushers should be more courteous in advising audience on the restrictions of photography. One usher was a little rude, telling me NOT to snap any photos of the musical. I was not taking any photos during the show BUT when I entered and was about to sit down, that was more than 30mins before the show started! Another usher came to explain to me that I can take photos before the show, or after, but not during it is on. That is totally fair and polite.\nThere was also a lot of slamming of the door during the show. Ushers should control this at the door or maybe the management should advised the audience to try to go to the washrooms only during intermission in order to avoid disturbing the show.\nApart from all these, MBS is doing an excellent job in getting these world class  musicals into the country.",
