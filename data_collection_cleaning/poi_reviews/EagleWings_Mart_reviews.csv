Chee wee Loo,1,"the evening shift staff are perpetually on ""10 mins toilet break"", with the signs hanging there and doors locked. Shouldn't they comms for a quick replacement from the EagleWings Cinema or restuarant to stand in when one goes off to the washroom?",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115106752903650889875/reviews

They also have a steam Pao machine with siewmai! And thankfully it’s halal!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103137411498324824810/reviews
Maureen Tan,5,"I recently visited EagleWings Mart and had an outstanding experience, thanks to one of their amazing staff, Hasyima. From the moment I walked in, Hasyima greeted me with a warm smile and a friendly attitude, making me feel welcome right away.
She was incredibly helpful, her knowledge of the store's products was impressive, and she even provided some great recommendations. She has made my experience here smooth and enjoyable!
Thank you Hasyima, for your excellent service! EagleWings Mart is lucky to have such a dedicated and wonderful employee. I will definitely be returning and recommending this store to those who work around the area!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114067695434937907865/reviews
Ryuga Ax,1,"Horrible customer service, we went into the store on 14 September 22:49 and we chose our ice cream within seconds. However the cashier ( a very rude girl) depleasing informed us that she is doing settlement so we have to wait for her to count finish before she can help us do payment. We told her okay and we was standing there for a good 5-7 minutes and she rudely told us to come over here. After that she proceeded to to ask us if we want to pay by cash or card as she can only accept cash because she do settlement already??? I don't understand the shop stated that it closes at 11 so I have the right to purchase and if cannot accept card why not tell us first instead of making us stand there like idiots watching her count money. I really don't understand why you guys hire such people to attend to your store. Very disappointed kap resident who always visited the mart below.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108347588106495659733/reviews
