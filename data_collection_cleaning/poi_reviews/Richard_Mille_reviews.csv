DR DAVY GOH,5,"Located at MBS Hotel Tower 2.
Firstly, the staffs were friendly and approachable. They took time to share the history of Richard Mille and also on the superior technology vs other brands watches.
Secondly, the design and layout of the store were very impressive. Gave a very modern and luxurious feeling.
Lastly, the majestic grandeur and simplicity of RM watches were so captivating... easily justify the prices for the watches.

The lady manager gave me a RM magazine, really appreciated her kind and generous gesture.

Overall experience 10 stars!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100178836333366849641/reviews
Jerome Tan,1,"Extremely poor customer service. Had visited Singapore for the holidays and had brought an extra strap which I brought to the boutique to swap out. Refused to assist as it was an after market strap (I had to get an after market strap as the rubber belts are completely sold out and the wait time is over a year where I live).

I mentioned that Iâ€™m not from town and asked if they could point me somewhere which I could pay to change the strap OR if they could lend me the tool for me to change the strap myself.

Flat out refused and hurriedly tried to get me out the store. Shame on RM and the branch manager who simply looked on.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110462207425687308906/reviews
Revival Clinic Bangkok,5,Had an awsome experince here. Strolled in wanting a few new straps. Met a Rep called Randy. RM should give him a cape! Service was impeccible.

B,5,"Wife wanted to view and have a feel of RM for the first time hence we popped by the boutique.

We were pleasantly served by Kelvin and Geraldine whom were extremely warm and friendly with their service and knowledge.

Definitely recommend people to drop by and experience the brand :)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115242329069445525274/reviews
