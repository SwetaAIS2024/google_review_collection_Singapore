      "text": "Had a great experience at Sushi Express today. Despite the long queue, Aunt Ng Ai Tee, the checkout cashier, showed exceptional attentiveness and kindness. She noticed my sushi box was dripping water onto my hand and, as soon as it was my turn, the first thing she did was hand me a tissue. Such a small gesture, but it truly made my day! The food was delicious and reasonably priced too. Excellent service and great value‚Äîhighly recommend!",

Every dip into the soy sauce and wasabi, my sushi falls apart. üò¢ Unagi is quite plain but its soy sauce and wasabi are great. üëçMaybe, it is just my sushi, I do not know.\n\nThe cashier lady is good, fast hand because the place cannot afford to have many people inside paying and looking for their sushi.",
