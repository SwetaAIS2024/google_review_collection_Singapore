      "text": "Located along Agape Village in Lorong 8. Quite out of the way to be honest if you do not know the area well. They were severely shorthanded on a weekday with probably only one staff in the kitchen and one at the counter.\n\nRegardless, they tried their very best to serve the dishes asap with a waiting time of less than 20minutes. The steamed fish was a huge standout for me - super fresh and generous portion at only $12.80. Not too salty or fishy too. Pad Thai was average. Green Curry chicken was a little too spicy. Thai stuffed chicken was average too. Wanted to try the chicken cutlet but it was sold out rather quickly. Their thai milk tea came in a huge cup and was rather generous without much ice added too. Worth the try overall although I wished the menu could be expanded slightly (maybe add a pineapple fried rice?).\n\nCarpark spaces limited. Seating also quite limited at maybe 30-40 pax. They serve breakfast and toasts as well apparently.",
