      "text": "The stall sell fish soup noodle & shen mian (生面) with minced pork, pork liver, veggie and egg with superior soup. I order less noodle more soup w/o egg cos it affect the superior soup taste. Tried fish soup with added pork liver but I prefer just pork shen mian (No. 11) w/o egg. The pork liver pcs are fresh and usually just cooked. They have other noodle type like bee hoon and ban mian etc. The stall close earlier on Sat, Sun & PH around 3/4pm. It’s my number 1 choice for pork noodle soup in SG although it’s a challenge to eat the piping hot noodle soup in Singapore summer weather.",

Please not that the bowl of fish soup noodle in this photo is with extra $1 of fish. They gave batang fish which is an expensive fish. All in all 5 stars.\n\nThe sheng mian was also very nice. The noodle still springy and the soup thick and nice.",
