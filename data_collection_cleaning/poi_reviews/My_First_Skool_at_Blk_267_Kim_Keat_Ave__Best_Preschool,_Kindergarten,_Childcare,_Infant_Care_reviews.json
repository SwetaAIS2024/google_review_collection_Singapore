Can see the bonding and team spirit among the teachers across all the level!\n\nSpecial thank to teacher Jeah and Qiu Lao Shi whom take care my baby girl (Playgroup) so well. We as parents can see the tremendous changes for my baby girl Averie!\n\nTo Dinah, I would recommend my friends with new born or going PG to your branch!",
