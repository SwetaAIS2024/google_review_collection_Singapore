This branch is newly setup so it is very clean and the owner emphasize on quality organic food is a plus. Teachers are very patience and  passionate with kids. My girl adapted quickly, love the classes and the food!\nHighly recommended for parents to consider in the area.....",

The environment is bright, clean, and well-organized—better than some branded preschools I visited. The teachers and staff are warm and pleasant too.",

On visiting, we were impressed by the environment, facilities and most importantly, the faculty are really passionate and friendly towards the children. Onboarding process is seamless and unlike some other preschools, there is very good cross communication between parents and staff.\n\nWe would highly recommend Emile to anyone looking for a warm and competent preschool!",
