The staffs were very helpful in assisting me with the claim against my company's insurance company when I first visited 2 months ago.  My chronic medicine is quite expensive and this clinic carries them.  I was there at 11am and out within 30mins.",

      "text": "Worst attitude from a doctor I have ever seen. There were no patients in front of me and I had to wait 30 mins. When I went in presenting my symptoms (bad migraine on 20th week of pregnancy) to him, the doctor actually had the audacity to ask me why I am having migraine in a bad attitude. I had to name the obvious and tell him I came to see a doctor to get diagnosed.. He also likes to powerplay his patients by staring at them for 20 seconds without saying anything. Except from prescribing me with panadol, he did not check me for anything else.This is by far the most unprofessional and unqualified doctor I have ever seen. Highly discourage anyone feeling unwell to see this doctor as it will only make you feel more stressed up while already unwell. I think the overall reviews are telling of his skills and professionalism.",

Although he can be strict sometimes, he's very experienced and knows what is best for the patient. Not to mention, it is also cheaper than most other clinics found at void decks of a HDB flat. With all these factors combined, what's not to love about this doctor?\n\nNote: The queue here can get quite long during peak periods, be prepared to wait if you intend to go during these times.",

He said \"ya la opening now la, you cannot wait meh.\" That is no way to treat a patient. When I went in, he just stared into my eyes for 20 seconds and asked me what's wrong. this doctor is unprofessional to the max. Please do not visit. I would have given 0 stars if I can",
