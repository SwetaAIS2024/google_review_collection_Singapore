      "text": "Our experience with Learning Vision has been nothing short of awesome. Our son started with their toddler care when he was 17 months old and has started K1 this year. The teachers (including even the non teaching staff) are attentive and caring, with great emphasis on hygiene and quality of meals. The curriculum is comprehensive as we noted our son is developing well in early literacy, bilingualism and mathematics. He absolutely loves going to school, meeting his teachers and friends. This is indeed a great pre school to put your child in.",

My children are thriving under the teachers' care, and I appreciate how patient and loving they all are. Any center can offer a myriad of programmes and curriculum, but it's the people that make all the difference. Those at LV@HC definitely do.",
