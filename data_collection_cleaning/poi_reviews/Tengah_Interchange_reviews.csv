Nur Iman Rostam,5,"Tengah Bus Interchange is finally open for business. The green color theme is very vivid to reflect Singapore's SG Bus's commitment to ensuring a smooth journey for all. Managed only by Tower Transit Singapore, there are currently only 3 trunk-service buses running from this newly opened bus Interchange - 870, 871, and 992 that connects Tengah with Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak, Bukit Timah, and Jurong East.

As it is new, do expect least human activities as Tengah is still a live construction and the bus Interchange is meant to serve its first connectivity to other parts of Singapore.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110287485091231667131/reviews
Isaac How,5,"Finally had a chance to visit this new town! There are many things I find unique such as the exit numbering similar to that of an MRT station and the NTWU canteen which looks a lot more like a coffee shop! This bus interchange would certainly be VERY beneficial to the people who are living or are moving nearby. Looking forward to coming here in the future and more people around. For now, it's quiet and peaceful.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107769303352901846138/reviews

Aravindhan Ravikumar,5,"Expected to open on Sunday 21 July 2024, this interim bus interchange will be the first bus interchange in Tengah which is located at Tengah Boulevard near the junction with Tengah Park Avenue as well as Parc Woods @ Tengah residential estate to prevent confusion with the integrated transport hub which will be built at Tengah Town Centre adjacent to Tengah MRT Station on the Jurong Region MRT line. The interchange, which has three alighting berths and six boarding berths and is managed by Tower Transit Singapore under the Bulim Bus Package, will have three bus services: 870 (to Jurong Town Hall Bus Interchange), 871 (to Upper Bukit Timah Road near Beauty World MRT Station via Bukit Gombak) and 992 (to Bukit Batok Bus Interchange). The vehicular access to this bus interchange is at the signalised intersection with Tengah Boulevard and the bus interchange, which sits on a site which is reserved for residential use under the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106935057144500350420/reviews
SCW,4,"Good bus interchange. However, it is very inconvenient to walk to this interchange from the nearby HDB blocks due to construction works affecting the pavements in the area.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101091414004684840034/reviews
