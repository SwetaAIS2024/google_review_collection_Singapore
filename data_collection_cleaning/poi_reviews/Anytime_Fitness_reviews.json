      "text": "I'm thoroughly impressed with AFTJ Gym! The facilities are conducive to a great workout experience. To take it to the next level, I'd suggest adding more equipment and a digital clock for tracking rest time.\n\nHowever, the true gems of AFTJ are the staff, particularly Watie and Herzy. They go above and beyond their duties, making every member feel valued. Watie's exceptional maintenance efforts ensure the equipment is always in top condition, and her organized activities foster a sense of community. Herzy's expertise as a trainer is unmatched, and his willingness to correct techniques and provide guidance to all members, not just his clients, is truly commendable. His jovial nature makes every interaction a pleasure.\n\nWatie and Herzy form an incredible team, and their dedication has created a supportive and motivating environment. Kudos to the entire AFTJ team! We appreciate you, Watie and Herzy - keep up the fantastic work!",
