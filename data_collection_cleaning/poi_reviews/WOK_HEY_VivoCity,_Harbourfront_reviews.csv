William Lu,5,"I always like their fried rice especially with prawns ðŸ¤¤
The queue wasn't that bad. It was only 10 minutes when I ordered.

They should put notification on their order to send to customer phone. Sometimes it gets more than 30 minutes, no one would wait there that long.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
Victor Chan,4,"Had the prawn fried rice. Packaging looked cool and was functional. Good portion, good serving of prawns. Liked the fried rice and egg flavor, prawns were springy and fresh. Not too salty for me. Liked the chilli, next time will need to ask for more.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109779937957354872611/reviews
Shop S,3,"They seem to have changed bother the size and type of prawns.  Prawns are not the glass prawns - crunchy type.

William Ow,4,"Edit 2025 Apr - Renovated and moved to a different spot. Same food but now using self service counter.

Typical Wok Hey. Choose your fried rice combi and they will prepare it on the spot. Much more expensive than the hawker but the quality is there.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102779766764269863375/reviews
