Joanna Amor Dianco,5,"My second time here!
The staff are friendly and attentive, even when the kitchen is very busy with non-stop dine-in, take-out, and delivery orders. The wait time for food was reasonable—around 10 to 15 minutes. It’s usually full.

The food is reasonably priced, with large portions and authentic, rich flavors. One dish is enough for two people. We had Clear Tom Yum Soup and a Small Crispy Omelette (recommended), both of which were very generous for two people to share.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115854242915114538995/reviews

Jeena Hey,3,"I've been here a few times since the Covid days, and the food was always so good! Today, I brought a few colleagues because I missed the food, but I was disappointed to find that the standard has dropped. The minced meat was too salty and not spicy, the kang kong was not spicy, and the tom yum was more sour than flavorful. However, the pork and desserts were still good.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113552326796326120362/reviews
