Touristmouse,5,"I walked past the stall on a Public Holiday at 11ish am and was intrigued by the queue. So, I decided to join in. Thankfully, the queue move fast and it turned out to be a fantastic decision!

What really caught my eye were their Vietnamese banana fritters - never seen them anywhere else. They did not disappoint! Crispy on the outside and filled with sweet, warm banana puree - pure deliciousness. Definitely going back for more of these!

Update: they are closed every other Monday.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110409011587721664076/reviews
Sylvia Cheng,3,"The lady boss at Bangkit outlet is stingy & calculative... I bought 5 items which was all squeezed & packed in one carrying plastic bag, I took a smaller carrying plastic bag in order to pick out one at a time to eat, but she told me she had to charge me $0.10 for the extra bag. If I were to buy the 5 items at 5 individual time, I would have the items all individually packed and she would have to waste 5 bags...",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112213382133939601555/reviews
Desmond Ling,5,"The Vietnamese banana fritters are really good! Crispy on the outside; Soft, chewy, and tangy on the inside - a good balance of texture and flavour. Goes very well together with a hot beverage. I can eat this everyday for breakfast. The other fried fritters such as peanut sesame ball, poh piah and you tiao are pretty good too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106912383472576674610/reviews
