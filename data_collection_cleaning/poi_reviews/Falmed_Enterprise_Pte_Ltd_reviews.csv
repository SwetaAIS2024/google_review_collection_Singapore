Tricia L.,1,"Super stingy with their plastic bags… especially the lady boss 🙄 not surprised the reviews here are so bad! Bought a bottle of barley when the lady boss refused to give me a carrier, rudely told me off to put with ny other items in a small caipng bag when theres clearly no space. Improve on your attitude please. Don’t start a business if you’re going to be so stingy 🤮",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103499708856848067789/reviews
dawn quek,1,"If I could give zero, I would give zero. Extremely arrogant and egoistic lady boss. Didn’t want to give advice at first when we were choosing the medicine for our child, told us to ask the man in charge there, so we didn’t bother her. After a while she started to recommend a cough mixture, but I didn’t buy and bought something else instead, as I wasn’t comfortable with a medicine that I have not seen before.  She got offended and told us off rudely! She told us, “I already told you this medicine is good, you don’t believe me, and why you act as if I’m bluffing you?” As a customer, I didn’t know I don’t have the rights to choose what to buy. Amazing customer service!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105144259932002237341/reviews
John 3:16,1,"Happened to patronize this shop on the way to Tampines.
Found The male boss is extremely arrogant and so is 1 of the woman.
They shout at their customers. They are very rude to their customers.
The whole shop was nearly empty and made a mistake of going in.
Buyers beware.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113858735286837630249/reviews
Bryan Se To,1,"I've stayed Simei for over 20 years and have patronised this shop consistently. The boss' attitude has not been great at the start but it has gotten worse recently that he quarrels with my grandparents, neighbours and other customers. Extremely bad service.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100563645800848895930/reviews
