      "text": "Came here on a Friday evening with some friends and had a fantastic time. Food was scrumptious, flavours intense and tasty. We started with some Avocado creme and tortilla chips ($12) which was nice.\n\nThe mains were available for 1 for 1 deals on the Entertainer app, we highly recommend the\nGinger lemongrass noodles ($18) - which tastes like pasta in Thai green curry and is very fragrant, and the Linguine carbonara ($18) - rich creamy carbonara. Also good was the miso cured salmon ($21) and spaghetti aglio olio ($18). Additionally not under Entertainer was the Pork belly ($28) - crispy and quite nice, though not as tender as we would have liked.\n\nOverall 5/5 rating, would come back here. Surprised that not more people were here dining as it was deserving of a bigger crowd.",
