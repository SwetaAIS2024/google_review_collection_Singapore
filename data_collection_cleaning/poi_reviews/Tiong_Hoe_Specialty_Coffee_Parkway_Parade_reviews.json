House brew gachalla.\nService was friendly and prompt.\nCoffee was served in a ceramic cup instead of paper cup.\nSmooth and delicious.\nBut not strong though.\nI found their onyx blend is much more delicious than gachalla when I first tried them at their singpost centre outlet.\n\nBought mille crepe from japanese/sushi stall in the fairprice. Perfect combo.\n\nArea is a bit noisy due to Pok√©mon gaole machine behind the coffee stand.",

I didn't quiz the staff on the charges cos the amount seemed about there $8+ for a drink + pastry and $5.70 (correct) for another drink. But I don't recall ordering extra oatmilk  though. My fault I didn't scrutinise the breakdown of the bill properly cos I was eager to rest my legs. The coconut pastry was abit on the hard and dry side.",

      "text": "üëç Service:\nThe young man serving us was super helpful and professional. He overheard me asking my husband direction to the toilet and gave me a very clear direction. While we were going to the toilet, he and a female staff agree to watch our coffee for us. Before leaving, my husband asked for water using his emptied coffee cup. The young man threw away the ice stained with coffee and gave my husband new ice with water. Excellent initiative, I'd say.\n\nüòë Coffee:\nThe coffee is very aromatic and taste great. However, the cup size is smaller than my palm, making it expensive and unsatisfying. With the ice taking up more than half the cup, the cold version can be finished in one gulp.\n\nüòë Cost:\nFlat white - $5.40\nChange milk to oat milk - $1.10\nCold - $0.55\n\nFor clarification, it was not \"Additional milk\" or \"Additional ice\" as stated on the receipt. It was a change of milk and cold instead of hot.\n\nüëç Environment:\nLocated right at the entrance of NTUC, you would expect it to be a bustling place, but the seating area is tucked away in a corner, so it is very quiet and peaceful. The seating area is also very spacious, clean, and comfortable.",

There are previously little seatings available, but one can take away to drink within Fairprice‚Äôs food area. The coffee prices are a tad high considering it‚Äôs location and ambiance (or lack of). However the coffee tasted good, and is a decent place for a quick stop to curb your caffeine addiction ‚òïÔ∏è",
