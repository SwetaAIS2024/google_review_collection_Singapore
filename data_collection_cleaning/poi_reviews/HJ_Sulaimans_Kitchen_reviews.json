      "text": "Ordered plain bee hoon goreng which they had cooked and displayed. Chose tahu goreng, bagedil, hotdog, tempeh and chicken wing. Total $10.50.\nI asked for price breakdown, the lady said bee hoon $2.50, hotdog $2‚Ä¶ i stopped listening when she said hotdog $2. There was about 7-8 pieces of hotdog only.. $2???!!! Seriously?\nI know f&b rental high, overheads all that high. But freaking $2 for 7-8 pieces CUT HOTDOGS? That‚Äôs like only about 2 pieces of whole hotdogs! I commented $2 very expensive but i paid anyway as i did not want to cause any trouble or hold up the queue.\nThe food was oily and bee hoon was cold. Chicken wing was not well marinated, only the skin tasted some turmeric and the insides were bland. Not worth $10.50 at all.\nPlease look into your pricing.. it‚Äôs crazily expensive and charge rightfully!\nDefinately not recommended and this is the last $10.50 you‚Äôll be getting from me.",
