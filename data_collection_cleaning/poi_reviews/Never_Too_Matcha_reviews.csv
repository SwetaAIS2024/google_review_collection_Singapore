Dion Tan,5,"Came across their poster & decided to give their Hojicha a try, after all, who‚Äôs going to reject the idea of having an iced Hojicha on a hot day?

Anyways, I ordered their iced Hojicha Oat, as recommended by one of the sisters and wow it was really a fantastic drink, the Hojicha coupled with the oat milk produced a very nice milky texture and only regret I had was not buying another cup!

Please give this a try should you ever pass by Bishan!!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102861218865029013413/reviews
