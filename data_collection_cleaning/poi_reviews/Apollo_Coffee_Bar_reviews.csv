SL Wong,4,"Didn't take a picture but the omelette burger was decent, has caramelised onions which added a sweet touch. The honey tater tots however were slightly expensive in my opinion, and not all of the tots have honey on them, more like a light drizzle, after the initial few pieces at the top, the rest didn't have any honey on them.

The chilli biang biang noodles was nice, garlicky and a little spicy comes with 5 pieces of fried chicken and an egg. A little pricy too at 20 dollars, considering the noodle portion is quite little.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105996375849930329549/reviews
Eric Lee,4,"Iâ€™ve been to Apollo several times and I have to say every time Iâ€™m there the food is good. It does look a bit better than it taste, but still overall 4 starts. I only two small issues with the place which is the very high noise level and menu prices are also a bit high. Otherwise it is definitely a great place to hang out!!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113775188408100673442/reviews
L Loy,3,Cafe is great for chill out but not a proper dining restaurant. Had the fried chicken (tasted great) burger with hard stale curly fries served on a tiny metal plate. The salted caramel waffle with ice cream was good. Not many non coffee ice drinks available,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115284365331884213413/reviews
Alexandre Yeoh,5,"A charming little coffeehouse nestled in suburban Serangoon, offering a delightful selection of brunch fare. Among the dishes we sampled, the grilled sandwich stood out â€“ a delicious combination of GruyÃ¨re and mozzarella cheese, house-made bacon jam, and wholegrain mustard. We also enjoyed the Breakfast Burger, accompanied by crispy tater tots. It featured cheddar scrambled eggs, spicy aioli, caramelised onions, and back bacon, all served in toasted brioche buns. Excellent food and a wonderful atmosphere.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105525343007754662187/reviews
Big Willie,4,"I have been there a couple of times for coffee. Pretty good business. Can consider if you are going for a cup of quick coffee. Provides you with water that is always helpful after coffee.

Their staff members are quick to fulfill orders. Very friendly and helpful. Payment is easy. All you need to do is to order after seats were provided.

The atmosphere is similar to most cafes. Neat and clean. Nice place to have coffee if you like some crowd noise. It is not suitable for people who want absolute tranquility.

Will be back again ðŸŒŸ",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106109863968118682802/reviews
