Norm Bour -Travel Younger,3,"Let's face it, it's a $10 per night hostel in Singapore. It is seedy, not the cleanest place in the world, and the bathroom would be disgusting by many people's standards. But it is just a 10-minute walk to the MRT so easy access to the airport.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114512850774525060894/reviews
