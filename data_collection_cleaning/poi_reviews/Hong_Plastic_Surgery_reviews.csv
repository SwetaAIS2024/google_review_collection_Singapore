Angela Lee,5,"Dr Hong came to my three year old daughter‚Äôs rescue at 2am. She had a fall at home and busted her bottom lip. Mount Alvernia‚Äôs A&E called him in and he came at 2am to stitch her lip up in the operating theatre. He completed the op at around 3am and he later magically appeared at her ward at 10am to check on and discharge her. Even though he‚Äôs not a paed, he was understanding and patient with my daughter. During stitch removal at his clinic about a week later, my daughter was scared but he was extremely understanding and did his best to comfort her. Dr Hong‚Äôs clinic nurses were also amazing and understanding to me as a traumatized parent and her as a cheeky and not so cooperative patient. His stitching is also very nice and left minimal scarring on my daughter‚Äôs lip. The fall was on 01 Dec 2022 and I would like to express my gratitude to Dr Hong, the anaesthetist and his clinic nurses.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103659768241188973334/reviews
