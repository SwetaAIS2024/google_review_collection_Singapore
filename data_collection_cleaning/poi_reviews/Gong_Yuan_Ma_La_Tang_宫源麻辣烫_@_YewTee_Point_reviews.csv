Jie Sheng Ong,5,"The ingredients are fresh, the portions are generous, and the service is quick even during peak hours. The ambiance is clean and casual, great for a quick lunch or a casual dinner with friends. Prices are fair for the quality and portion size, though the spice level can be intense—so beginners might want to start mild.

Highly recommended for spice lovers and anyone looking to experience authentic mala hotpot flavors.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105022043190234144508/reviews
J,1,"This place has serious hygiene and comfort issues. There were huge flies everywhere, landing on the ingredients—especially the raw meat. I even pointed it out loudly right next to a staff member, but she completely ignored me and walked away. Later, another employee came out to swat them away, but they just kept coming back.

The air conditioning was also weak, making the place uncomfortably warm. This likely contributes to the fly problem and raises concerns about whether the raw food is being stored at a safe temperature. With poor hygiene, improper food handling, and an uncomfortable dining environment, this will definitely be my last visit.

And the price is also on pricer side.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113966954151240288230/reviews
Z Ong,3,"Definitely on the pricer side of mlt. Medium spicy is not as spicy as I expected and had a certain level of msg for the soup. You can add on spring onions, Chinese celery, kimchi etc on the side by yourself. Quite a lot of options for meat and processed food. Overall it's alright pretty average but not quite worth it for the price. Also I wonder if they got zero when they weigh items.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100995158974633407890/reviews

Ivan Lim,3,"First time here after their opening since  2 weeks ago. Did not enjoy the experience. Throughout the meal, there were flies circling around the shop especially the raw food area. The shop is hot, not comfortable. I purchase a soft drink but it does not come with a cup of ice. Food wise not much different from similar establishments but the price is 30% more.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107871991607011195787/reviews
