The way she did her service is bad. if really people cannot take trolley in, just approach them and say 'dont do it next time' rather than gossiping in chinese. i done payment, she still follow me to the exit and intentionally point to the sign.\n1. if people are so bound by rules without giving a helping hand with 2 big luggages, how i am going to buy oranges?\n2. if the rule is so serious, she should have stopped me from entering.\ni felt bad, really bad moood. Still call this place finest",
