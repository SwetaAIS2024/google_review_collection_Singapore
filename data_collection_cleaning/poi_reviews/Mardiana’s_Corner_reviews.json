      "text": "Tucked away in a quiet secluded coffee shop is Mardiana’s Corner. They sell a wide variety of food from Shabsuka to their awesome Satay!\n\nThe Laksa Assam is out of this world! The Satay is nicely marinated the traditional way. NOT how everyone else is doing it with lots of sugar. Theirs is NOT. Please try it and you’ll want more. They also have Satay Kicap which was made famous in JB, Malaysia. Satay Kicap only comes with mutton. Try it if you want something different. They only sell Satay in the evenings.\n\nThe staff are nice and friendly and it’s never overcrowded.\n\nHighly recommended!!!",
