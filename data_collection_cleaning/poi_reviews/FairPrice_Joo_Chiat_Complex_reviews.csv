Keith Tan,5,"This outlet reminded me of the days when Oriental Emporium was around. You squeeze along aisle to look for items. There are corners you have to turn inside the store because of its structure. What brought back memories was the tiled staircase inside the store that brought you up to the second floor. It's like a treasure trove. A niche here for snacks, a grove there for drinks. If you can't climb the stairs, you have a lift, and forget the large trolleys, they don't exist here.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115094164853599753783/reviews

Justin Xiao,5,The staffing this fair price are very nice and considerate. It is two floors so it is one of the largest fair price Ntuc that I have been to Singaporr. The trolley is actually outside the store not inside the store on the side. There’s also a drinking water fountain at that checkout.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114147367394477307367/reviews
John Chhuhan,1,"Is this true?? Cashier said they cannot accept coin when we made payment by cash . Coin cannot use in FairPrice joo Chiat ? If so why you give coin when return changes . Honestly this is not fair at all. If this FairPrice don’t accept coin then don’t give coin to customers , instead give notes .
I am doing research why we cannot use coin to pay. Or is cashier lazy ?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101086345341870098322/reviews
