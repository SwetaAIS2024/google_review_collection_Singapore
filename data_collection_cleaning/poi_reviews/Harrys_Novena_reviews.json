      "text": "I have to say that the food is good. I enjoyed all of them. We arrived at about almost 9 pm. The waitress told us that the kitchen is closing at 9.30 pm so we made our orders. After the food arrived, she came to us again and said The place is closing at 10 pm. At almost 10 pm, she came over again and told us they were closing. No smile, just a short sentence \"we are closing\". We know that you are closing and we are finishing up. Please train your staff to be more understanding and be more polite. I know the staff is going home soon or they need to stay after 10 pm to watch the dishes. Her manner gave me an awkward situation because I brought my guests here for a quick dinner. Anyway, the place is located in the mall. It is convenient.",
