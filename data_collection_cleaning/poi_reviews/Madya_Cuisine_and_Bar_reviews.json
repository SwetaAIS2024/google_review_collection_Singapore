      "text": "Had a delightful experience at this restaurant! The food was excellent, with their biryani standing out the most, perfectly cooked, and served with a decent portion. Prices were reasonable for a restaurant.\n\nThe ambiance was cozy, dim lighting, which created a relaxed and intimate vibe. Despite visiting on a weekend, the crowd was manageable, adding to the slight buzz/pleasant experience.\n\nThe service staff were friendly and attentive, ensuring our needs were met promptly. Our food arrived quickly and was served piping hot, which was a big plus considering we came late towards the end of dinner service.\n\nIt‚Äôs a family-friendly spot that works just as well for a casual dinner or unwinding with a beer. One small drawback is that manoeuvring around can be tricky if it rains, consider only going if it isn't raining. Worth a visit!",

      "text": "We ordered their Naan, Garlic Butter Chicken & Briyani. Food is authentic and good. However, service needs to be improve. The briyani chicken came but not the rice. We had to repeatedly remind them for 3 times but was told it would be served in 5 mins. The very last time, we were frustrated and told them we will cancel the order. They then admitted that their staff had forgotten about the rice. The manager is quite polite about the mistake. Just avoid ordering from the lady. If you really do, just keep checking and remind them about it. The seats are external and will have mosquitoes.",

Despite clearly mentioning my dietary preferences while ordering, the food was not prepared accordingly. It lacked authenticity, and the flavors were underwhelming.\n\nThe dishes were either too oily or bland, and some items did not match what was described on the menu.",
