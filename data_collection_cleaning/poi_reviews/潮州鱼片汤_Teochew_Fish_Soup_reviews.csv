M Ang,5,"So glad to have discovered this gem in Punggol selling Teochew styled fish soup! Comes with clear fish broth (with option to add milk) made with roasted fish bones. There's also option to add a variety of other seafood.
Reminds me of Maxwell Teochew fish soup. So good ❤️",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103937264274214717353/reviews

Evelyn Xu,5,"This fish soup stall in Punggol/Sengkang is definitely one of the better ones around. The other fish soup stalls I've tried often tasted lackluster and below average. The food is definitely value for money, with good amount of ingredients. The fish soup is robust and flavourful! They use batang fish and the fried fish is made with better quality dory, so it doesn’t fall apart easily. Additionally, they offer extra condiments like garlic, tau jiu, and fried garlic. The chili is more tangy than spicy but it goes really well with the soup. If you’re craving for fish soup, this place is worth visiting.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111461843421376502726/reviews
