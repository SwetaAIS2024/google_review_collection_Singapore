wheregot ime,1,"Probably the worst hokkien mee I had in my life.

Please note that I am not a regular at tagore. Came here to collect company delivery and saw this new shop decided to order one fried hokkien mee, $10, takeaway.

Upon returning home, to my surprise, no lard or pork was present in my hokkien mee. Is this a halal business model?

The noodles were not sufficiently fried, ""Zero"" wok hey detected.
Soup stock was mid so noodles tasted mid as well.

The middle aged cook was grumbling about his workload and being really moody throughout the cooking process of my wait.

Irregardless if he is the boss or staff, this shoddy attitude is highly undesirable.

The positive redeeming factors was 3 prawns provided were large and big, I applaud the fact they did not use Msg.

At the end of the day there are still better choices in yishun and AMK. If no improvements are made, I doubt this business would last more than one single year.

Regrettably, I feel that this hokkien mee has neither the value nor taste. Kindly look elsewhere.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104519067093914336738/reviews

Nicholas Onn,5,"Hokkien Mee was surprisingly good! Fried Rice was also very good full of wok hey! Prawn pot was not bad but rmb to eat the prawns first otherwise they will overcook.

Overall a very satisfying meal for a cold day!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101262888490467424847/reviews
