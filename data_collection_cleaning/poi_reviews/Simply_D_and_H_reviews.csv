Salman Al-Farisi,5,"I came here twice, ate twice here. Located in a coffee shop, seats are not much but still able to dine in despite too many beer drinkers around so I think may not be compatible for Muslims to fine in at. The best option is to takeaway food.

Saw many bad reviews but fortunately for me, I enjoyed the fried rice, the food was good. No issues for me. Not bad, hidden gem in Yishun actually. Hope they can relocate to a better location, away from beers and so since selling halal food.

Will definitely patronize again. Thank you",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110906762679032409348/reviews

Kimyuu Hanriiya,4,Different ppl have different opinions but for me its simply delicious.i feel i have high standard but low expectations..especially love the fish fillet with fried rice its si crispy and the fish fillet looks very soft and grilled well.As for the chicken spagetti its tender and fresh the sauce is very thicky and appetising .It has quite a big helping as can be seen .Food panda did a good job to deliver food to me safely.Try it its not very cheap but its standard price for couples individual as well as families for young and old.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103955145126436238763/reviews
