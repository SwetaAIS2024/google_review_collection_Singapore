Ravintharan T.,2,Wanted to have breakfast at Paul’s paragon after many months. Never a frequent visitor as their service was not good but food was great. Decided to try again. What a disappointment. Cappuccino was bitter. Steak was tough and fibrous. Hash brown was soaked in oil. Only good parts were the egg n greens,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111287786116586286257/reviews
First Virtue,1,"Came here with the intention of buying a nice pastry to take home. Unbeknownst to the dining customers, there is a live roach tickling pastries of its choice in the display with its feelers. Cafe is full house.

I’m not sure if this is a sign of worse things inside the kitchen and staff are nonchalantly working alongside or covering up. There is of course the possibility of roach eggs that could’ve hatched in the shop or siblings of the pictured insect. Had to leave empty handed, sorry Paul.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100112638519644633716/reviews
Wilson Cheng,1,"The food here is good, but the service is disappointing. I ordered the cheese omelette complete, but the sausage was missing when it was served. When I informed the waiter, he seemed unsure about the dish. Later, he brought the missing sausage without offering any explanation.
We also ordered a cordon bleu, which took around 30 minutes to be served. Not sure if this delay is normal, but it felt longer than expected.
I was also dining with my 3-year-old child, but no cutlery or plate was provided for him. The lack of attention to service and details needs improvement.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110379697885222738246/reviews
