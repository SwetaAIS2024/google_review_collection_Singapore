Simon Bernie,5,"Situated near the waterfront and yet away from the busy foot traffic. Great location to pull up a chair, chat with friends, meet new people and quench your thirst, and settle your hunger. All this while listening to great tunes from the resident DJs they have on rotation.

Staff are always friendly, helpful and talkative.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112820759768503416921/reviews

Luke Phang,5,"[Pet-Friendly Drinking Hole Feature] Bayside Drinks & Eats, Marina Bay

Marina Bay might be a popular place to bring your dog for a walk, but pet-friendly eateries around the area are few and far between, despite many of them having an outdoor seating.

Thanks to a kind comment on Facebook, we stumbled across this drinking hole + snack place that is more than welcoming to Chewie and sheltered us during a tiring walk around the bay area.

The place serves mainly alcohol with small bites, and the seating arrangement consists mainly of high chairs, but they were friendly to dogs and made us feel at home. The price is also quite affordable.

We enjoyed our time here and they're worth a visit if you're taking an evening stroll with your dog around the area!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117681118694147432030/reviews
Ziggy Idris,3,Alfresco sidewalk bar that offers good varieties of beers. Beside that they also offer considerably good choices of liquors. They also serve light snacks to compliment your drinks. Staffs are extremely friendly and fun. Good thing that they also allowed you to choose your music to play by choosing your selection from the playlist at the bar. Most of the time they will close late so this is a good place for your one last drink for the road. Cheers !!!!,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115286083807057561459/reviews
