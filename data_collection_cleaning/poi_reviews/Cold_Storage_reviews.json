Furthermore, her attitude was unprofessional and lacking.

Unfortunately, this experience has deterred me from returning to this supermarket.",

      "text": "Despite Cold Storage being pricey than ntuc, I always found this Cold Storage to be strategically located to serve my needs. The ready cooked food section is one of the key highlights for a quick meal, and occasionally they have good promotions especially if you are a you member, but of cos expect the meat to not always be so juicy and soft as it might have been prepared way too early in advance. Hence, grabbing these food at around lunch time is better than getting them at the end of the day. The promotion I spoke about, could apply to all day round or it may be specific to the hour of the day. Apart from cooked food, there are some occasional price slashing which are embedded in their stockpile, so browsing may allow you to get a good find. I only wished that they made offers more obvious rather than having to browse isle by isle. People who want to find goat cheese can likely find it here compared to other supermarkets.",

A fair amount of their products are imported, so it does leave an impression that it is slightly more expensive compared to the other Supermarket chains.\n\nHowever, based on my purchases, the differences were negligible, so your experience may vary. I like that despite it not being massive, they have a cold cuts deli, a chicken rotisserie, ribs, sushi counter, even live lobsters and oysters all within reach of each other.\n\nStaff are also willingly to point out where particular items might be. Not a bad place to shop.",
