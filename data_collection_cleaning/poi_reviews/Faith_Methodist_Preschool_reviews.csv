Yvonne Ling,5,"I first came to know about Faith Methodist Preschool (Commonwealth) from my nephews who are the studying here. After doing my own research, i decided to enroll both my kids and they are now in N2 and K2 respectively. And I'm really glad that i did! The principal and teachers know each child by name and they genuinely care for the students. Many of the teachers have been with the school for years. I've watched them gently but firmly handle my children when they cry and refused to go into school and marvel in delight when my daughter proudly show her teachers her new stickers. And when I ask them if they like school, my kids say Yes! The school not only prepares the kids academically, they are also dedicated in instilling good values in the child. I feel safe leaving my child with Faith Methodist and i strongly recommend the school to anyone.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105630398314362805802/reviews
Vera Junwei Seah Ng,5,"From the very first day my child started at Faith Methodist Preschool, I've been thoroughly impressed by the dedication and commitment shown by the teachers. It's not just about the standard curriculum or daily routines, but it's evident that they genuinely care about each child's well-being and development. Their willingness to go the extra mile is clear, whether it's in guiding the children through challenging tasks, imparting knowledge with patience, or simply showing them affection and care. As a parent, knowing that my child is in such capable and nurturing hands gives me immense peace of mind. I wholeheartedly recommend Faith Methodist Preschool to any parent seeking a comprehensive and caring educational environment for their child.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117746276934604118204/reviews
Zhiyun Lin,5,"Kind teachers who show genuine concern for the children. They also are experienced and have good understanding of varying development across different children. Great environment as there is sufficient movement across different spaces for different activities. I believe that one telling sign of a good pre-school is the mood of the children, and whether the kids like to attend school. Faith Methodist Pre-school certainly has passed both aspects with flying colors. Furthermore, the children are exposed to a wide variety of learning topics, as my kid returns home to tell me excitedly about what the teacher has shown them in class.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116505267539969239499/reviews
Jenny Chye,5,"We sent all of our 4 boys to Faith Methodist Preschool. The principal, teachers and staff are very committed and patient. Itâ€™s a safe and nurturing environment, which has such a positive impact on our boys.

3 of our boys have graduated and always look forward to coming back to see the school. They had fond memories of the school and this is the amazing work of the principal, teachers and staff. Thank you!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116191396914164652031/reviews
Jacob James,5,"We don't speak mandarin at home, but one day N2 daughter came home from school teaching our helper mandrin. She also started speaking to my parents in mandarin much to our surprise. She also started counting and demonstrating the thing she learned in school.

The teachers here are gentle and friendly. My daughter looks forward to school everyday. Students here are more disciplined than those I see in childcare centres around my house. Maybe it's because the teachers have shorter hours with the children that they have the energy to maintain the discipline in school.

I'm happy that my children are not spending their formative years in a chaotic childcare centre. If there are parents who can afford not to send their children to childcare centres I would highly recommend them to give Faith Methodist Kindergarten a try.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108891416154740183707/reviews
