One of the things that I like about them is how spacious these zi char are, and usually with plenty of parking.  The first thing you would notice here is how friendly the staffs here are; we were given free bananas and deserts.  This is the first visit here for us and we will be back for more.  The 扣肉包 is definitely top class.",

We ordered small and it was already enough for 4 pax. Today we also tried braised sea cucumber duck, Kong bak bao and also XO sauce stir fry vege. All were very good! The staff also very friendly and accommodating. Gonna try their live seafood next...",

      "text": "Zi Char Gem at Ubi!\n\nOur family recently enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Rong Restaurant, and it quickly became a new favorite.  From the moment we walked in, the service was exceptional. Our server was friendly, attentive, and efficient, ensuring our orders taken promptly.  The atmosphere was lively but not overwhelming, perfect for a family meal.\n\nBut the real star of the show was the food.  Rong Restaurant prioritizes quality ingredients and skillful preparation.\n\nEverything was cooked to order, arriving hot and fresh. The portions were generous, allowing us to share and savor each dish.  The prices were reasonable, especially considering the high quality of the food and service.\n\nRong Restaurant is more than just a Zi Char restaurant; it's a place where families can create lasting memories over delicious food. We highly recommend it and can't wait to return!",

The steamboat was also packed with other ingredients, including yam, vegetables etc.\n\nShrimp paste chicken was also delicious. Chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and the shrimp paste sauce was flavorful and addictive.\n\nOverall, had a positive experience. The food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. Worth trying.",
