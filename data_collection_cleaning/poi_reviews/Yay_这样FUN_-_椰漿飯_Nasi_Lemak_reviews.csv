Benito Linus,5,"This Nasi Lemak stall is a one-woman show. And her Nasi Lemak omelette is very interesting and creative! Ordered the chicken cutlet set, and actually she has other side dishes like teriyaki chicken and also ebi tempura! I love the belacan chilli, it has a spicy kick! The portioning was good too, lots of ikan bilis and kacang, and rice was fragrant as well. Very good, will be back again!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114106152376985360330/reviews
Francis How,5,"I've eaten at this place quite a few times. Food quality is consistently good. Love the generous portions of broccoli and cabbage. Nasi Lemak rice portion is fragrant and healthily kept small. The chillies are not sweet like the typical Nasi Lemak but it's spicy enough to compliment the fried chicken wing. Overall, it's delicious food prepared without haste and one can fully appreciate the desires of the owner to serve healthy, yummy and yet affordable food.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114772619001040044138/reviews
CK C,4,"Pretty good plate of Nasi Lemak. The egg was perfectly fried while the chicken wing was crispy and succulent. The rice was also delicious but too small in portion even for a small eater, not enough to go with the sambal and ikan bilis. Unfortunately, the otah was quite stale. Satay is available at night.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Ethel,1,Waited 20min for nasi lemak. $5.2 for set B. Chicken cutlet was tiny and overfried. Papadam overfried and oily. Nasi no taste. Chilli no taste. Should have eaten the zhichar beside it,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117802466174121437490/reviews
