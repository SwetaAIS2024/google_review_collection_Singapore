It has been around since the 1980s and is still looking good.\nðŸª¸The Trail is very seclusive. There is hardly another one around.\nSo, you may take your time to focus on your ideal photo composition. Lots of photo opportunities.",

      "text": "Gorgeous and quiet!\nThis trail has been around but a recent revamp just made it more accessible. Located just off the road to Rasa Sentosa and where you will alight on the bus to Fort Siloso.\n\nThis is where to go to get away from the crowds at Labrador Park. It is where to go for a moment to reflect. The trail is in good shape, next to a sandy beach but beware of the currents. I guess it is not for swimming. But the views are wonderful. An old broken siloso jetty will make a great photo opportunity.\n\nThe trail is a loop through the secondary forest and to the coast. Wheelchair, pram and stroller friendly.",

It was a quiet and relaxing walk along the seaside ending with a bit uphill into the forest near the elevator of the Fort Siloso Skywalk.\n\nAlong the way, there are information boards telling you what are the buildings in front of you, what plants you are looking at, how Sentosa built this costal forest area, and why the air is cooler under the trees. This trail is quite educational when you have time to read.",
