The chicken was fall off the bone tender, and the soup was soooo good I wish there was more! I don’t know how they cook it but the ginseng wasn’t bitter at all, we finished it too!\n\nDefinitely would come back again",

Soup was decent, is really for the health benefit if anything. Can finish the whole pot.\n\nDou miao taste good but it is too expensive maybe $3 or $4... Why need such a huge margin?",

In general the soup was good though I would prefer it to be more bitter with Dang Gui 当归 probably than the sweetness for the soup. It came with a bag of herbs and 4 pieces of duck meat. Overall not expensive for the price of $8.\nProbably can try other soups it has too.",
