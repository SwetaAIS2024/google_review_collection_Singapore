M K,5,"Extremely down to earth and unpretentious establishment selling very affordable Indian food which tastes so good.

I was surprised by the selection of snacks (e.g Vadai, samosa etc) as well as the range of side dishes.

One of my most exciting finds in Joo Koon :-) highly recommended for those willing to try Indian food.

Will be back FOR SURE!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108574381639320020508/reviews
Tiny T,5,"Ambience: clean, comfortable, good place for business meal (some birds and flies appeared midway. But not a concern at all).
Food: so. Damn. Good. I don’t know if I was mad hungry but every single bite was heavenly. It’s at a forlorn location of Jooks but will go back just to eat again.
Service: Ample staff to entertain guests
Cost/Value for money: indian food is generally more ex but not necessarily nice. This one is goooood. Great afternoon meal.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106436141944625152534/reviews
Dumindu Nimsara,1,"On 2nd Aug ,Guy at the cashier (fat dark skin middle aged guy) charged me over for an egg Biriyani, to make the matter worse he served me with less rice 5.5$(No papdam)
Once I asked papdam his face become dull, He took the papdam with his bare hand and just put, As i take away food he must know it will become soggy this one basic common sense.
Hygiene-0

Tadek Watkins,1,"NO INTEGRITY WHATSOEVER. Went here for dinner and ordered 3 cheese pratas and a soda. they tried to charge me $13 saying $3.50 a prata but that still wouldnt add up to that much. told them i wasnt gonna pay that, they brought it down to $10.70 couldnt be bothered to argue anymore so just accepted it. Thought it was cause of my skin colour(im white) but gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed inflation had took its toll. Upon research later, even springleaf prata doesnt charge that much??? Absolutely disgusting.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107875984273823153708/reviews
