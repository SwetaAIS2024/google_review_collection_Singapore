      "text": "I understand that delays can happen, but my recent visit left me a bit unsettled. I registered at 6:45 pm and didn’t finish until 8:40 pm—waiting over 1.5 hours even though only 7 or 8 patients were ahead of me. As someone who was unwell, I was hoping for a bit more consideration during the wait. I also noticed that patients were sometimes seen out of order, which might have contributed to the delay. I hope the clinic can review its process to better support those who are not feeling their best. Overall, the slow pace and lack of consideration made for a very frustrating visit.",

She remembers I have a baby and despite needing to wait for some govt claim which takes ages, she was flexible for me to leave first and if needed to pay for any outstanding payment , they can arrange paynow options for me. Love the flexibility! Thank you!!",
