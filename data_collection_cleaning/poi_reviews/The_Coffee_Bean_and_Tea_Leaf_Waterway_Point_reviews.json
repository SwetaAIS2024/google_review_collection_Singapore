Friendly and helpful staff.\n\nFood could taste a little better though. Coffee is good.\n\nPastry puffs are 4/5\nBreakfast 11.90 deals are bland but well valued considering the inclusion of coffee.",

      "text": "Life in the F&B industry teaches you one thing very quickly: you’ll meet every type of guest imaginable. There are the kind ones who make your day with a smile or a “thank you,” and there are the ones who test your patience—demanding, entitled, or just in a bad mood.\n\nEvery shift feels like a new chapter, with new characters walking in and out of your life.\nSome guests are understanding, even when things go wrong. Others? Not so much. They complain about the wait, the food, the temperature—anything they can.\n\nAnd no matter how tired or stressed you are, you have to keep smiling, stay professional, and solve their problems.\n\nBy the end of the day, I’m drained. That’s when I head to Coffee Bean for my little ritual: a plate of Spicy Tuna Spaghetti.\n\nIt’s a small reward after dealing with the unpredictability of the day. Sitting there, away from the chaos, I take that first bite of pasta, and the world finally slows down. The spicy, savory sauce and the comforting carbs feel like they’re recharging me, piece by piece.",
