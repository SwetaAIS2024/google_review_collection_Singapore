      "text": "We went to this Thai restaurant for lunch on a weekday. It wasn’t very crowded, and we were seated immediately. We ordered the Pad Thai ($7), Pork Basil Rice ($7), Clear Broth Seafood Tom Yum ($13), and Red Ruby dessert ($4).\n\nThe Pad Thai was the wetter kind, not the dry, wok-fried Thai street style but it has good flavour. The Pork Basil Rice was tasty and fragrant, but be warned, it’s cooked Thai-style spicy! If you can't handle too much heat, definitely ask for less chilli.\n\nThe Tom Yum (clear broth version) was also very good, packed with seafood including squid, fish, prawn, and mussel. The broth was light but flavourful, with a nice balance of sourness and spice.\n\nThe Red Ruby dessert was refreshing and enjoyable, though the water chestnut crunch was quite subtle.\n\nOverall, the food was delicious, well-priced, and I’d definitely recommend it. Only downside there were quite a few flies around. Some might see it as a downside, but I took it as a sign of authenticity… or just that good food attracts company!\n\nUpdate: I visited the restaurant again and ordered pineapple fried rice, moo ping (grilled pork skewers), hot plate tofu, mixed vegetables, and fresh oysters. Everything was tasty and nicely cooked.",

      "text": "Coming back from Thailand after more than a decade, had my second experience here. Food was cooked to perfection. Taste wise, no complaints. Grilled pork neck wasn't greasy and yet carried the taste of properly grilled meat just like in the outskirts of Bangkok. Thai fish cake carried the authentic aroma and had the adequate bounce in each bite. Thai milk tea wasn't explicitly sweet. Everything was on point. Nothing overdone. Keep it up! Well done!",

      "text": "Had always wanted to try this place, and we finally did! We arrived around 5:20pm, and there were already a few tables occupied. The dinner crowd starts picking up around 6pm onwards.\n\nThe creamy omelette was served almost immediately after we placed our order — this was our favorite dish. Every bite was packed with umami. The generous amount of fresh, chunky crab meat complemented the rich, creamy omelette perfectly.\n\nNext came the clear tom yum soup. We found it quite average, so probably could skip this. However, it did have a decent amount of chicken.\n\nWe waited quite a while for the last two dishes as the crowd grew. The oyster mango salad was excellent! They were generous with the succulent oysters, and it had a good level of spiciness — very shiok! We just felt the mango salad portion could have been slightly more to balance out the oysters. Overall, this was our second favorite dish.\n\nThe last dish, grilled pork collar, arrived much later. It was tender and juicy, with a slight charred taste. By then, we were almost done with our rice, and the portion was quite generous, so we struggled to finish it.\n\nThe space is cramped, but they’ve managed to fit quite a number of tables. The staff were friendly too. Definitely coming back to try more dishes with larger group of family.",
