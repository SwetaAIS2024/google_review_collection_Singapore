Includes meatballs, minced meat, sliced meat, liver, mushrooms, and lettuce. Minced and sliced meat were marinated making it tender and flavourful. Pork lard adds fragrance. The accompanying soup is clear and savoury.",

Sure, the choice of noodle was not the usual mee kia or mee pok, but he really acted like I was making an extremely unreasonable request. I've actually bought the same order from this place multiple times with no issue previously, so I really don't think the issue was with my order.\n\nIn any case, please be prepared when ordering here. The noodles are of acceptable quality, but the store owner's unpleasant attitude may leave a sour taste in your mouth.",
