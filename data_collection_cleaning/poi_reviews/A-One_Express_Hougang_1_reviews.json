Dishes I enjoyed here are horfun, fried rice and their scrambled eggs rice bowls. The service was equally good; the staff were quick, attentive, and genuinely friendly, especially Joanne Chin who took the time to check on every customers’ needs. Her attention to detail and warm demeanor made me feel valued as a customer.",
