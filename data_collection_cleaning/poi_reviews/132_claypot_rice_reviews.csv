E,2,"Came here on a weekend night. Already reserved via phone and ordered in advance but when reached on time, no table, had to wait maybe 15 mins for a table Then after ordering, food took really long to come, almost an hour. Really pointless to reserve in advance, reserve already like never reserve at all.
Environment also fail. Seated in the indoor area and the aircon was really weak, almost as bad as sitting outside. Their aircon feels like 28 degs kind of temperature.
Food wise is ok, average at best. Probably when  you're hungry, hot and annoyed, your taste buds also shut down and your expectations are increased, because if you wait for so long, it better be fantastic. But fantastic it is not. Not value for money either.
First and last time here.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103665268796109855493/reviews
Ng Wei Meng,5,"Waited almost an hour for this delicious claypot rice. The wait is worthy.

Great flavour of the rice, nice amount of vegetables, chicken and salted fish. There are options to add more salted fish in claypot rice.

For 2-3 pax with packaging, costs around 18. It's much more affordable from the typical claypot rice we got some other places.

This place is flooded with eaters on a Saturday evening.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103072959491907955597/reviews

Karen Ang,1,"Food’s terrible
Ordered 2 pax claypot rice, more like 1.5 pax.
Lotus root peanut soup tasted so bland, damn obvious the chef can’t cook. Definitely not coming back again",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101225334016685436172/reviews
Gackie,5,"I have been a loyal supporter of this claypot rice for 5 years now, and the taste has always been consistently great. Originally, I only knew about the Old Airport Road location, but when I contacted the owner today, he told me that it would reopen on the 15th and instead invited me to their Bedok branch. When I arrived, it was during their break time, and the shop was empty. I thought I might have missed my chance to enjoy the meal, but after messaging the owner, he reassured me that it was fine, and that the rice had already been prepared for me! This level of care and thoughtful service truly touched me. The rice was perfectly cooked, each grain distinct, and the chicken was incredibly tender. It’s still the same familiar taste that warms the heart.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112193572634749225744/reviews
