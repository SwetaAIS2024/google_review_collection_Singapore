Brittany Kim,5,"There is a lot going on in this store. The concept is an interactive experience for kids in a cafe-like environment for adults. On the ground level by the cafe, kids can select a snack like cotton-candy, popcorn or waffles to create or cook for themselves. The food comes as a cooking station and brought to the table.

Upstairs is a crafting station filled with pendants, beads and buttons. Kids get to select an item to decorate such as a plastic jewelry box, hair pins, bracelets, or lanyards, and then they get to decorate by choosing a glue color and selecting different beads, buttons and ribbons.

I think this place could be enjoyed by children ranging from 4+. I didn't get a chance to try the food, but would be interested in coming back for my older child to try the cooking station.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101765306042531965622/reviews
