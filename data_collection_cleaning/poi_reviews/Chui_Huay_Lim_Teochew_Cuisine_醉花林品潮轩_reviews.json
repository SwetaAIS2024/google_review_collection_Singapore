      "text": "Chui Huay Lin Teochew Cuisine is a gem tucked away in a charming heritage clubhouse. The restaurant's ambiance perfectly complements its rich Teochew culinary offerings.\n\nThe service here is exceptional‚Äîstaff are attentive, warm, and always ready to ensure you have a great dining experience.\n\nAs for the food, it‚Äôs absolutely delicious. The menu offers a wide variety of options, and from what we tried, the steamed chicken stood out. The meat was tender, the gravy deeply flavorful, and the pickles added a delightful crunch that perfectly complemented the dish.\n\nAnother highlight was the crispy sea cucumber‚Äîa unique dish that amazed us. It was our first time trying deep-fried sea cucumber, and it was a revelation! Crispy on the outside and soft yet bouncy (\"Q\") on the inside, paired with a sauce that matched beautifully. Simply outstanding.\n\nConveniently, there‚Äôs parking available, making it easy for those driving.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy authentic and delicious Teochew cuisine in a lovely setting!",

Even after providing the feedback to the staff nothing further was done.\n\nHaving said that, of all the dishes, the highest praise goes to the Yam paste. It was smooth and tasty!\n\nService was also good, with attentive and helpful staff.",

Although there were some differences in opinion among my family because some prefer stronger taste and some prefer lighter taste for the different dishes. The food mostly meets our expectations while some were above our expectations.\n\nThe service was excellent as well. Special thanks to Justin serving us. He was attentive to our needs, always making the best effort to answer any doubts we may have.",
