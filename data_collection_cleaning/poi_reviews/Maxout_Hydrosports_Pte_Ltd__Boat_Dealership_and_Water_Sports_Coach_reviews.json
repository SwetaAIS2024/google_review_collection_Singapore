Great getaway from city living. Go feel it for yourself\n\nI met the Maxout crew in 2001 when i first got curious about wakeboarding. Ryan n his mates showed me how wakeboarding culture is meant to be. .  20 years later,  I am still loving the ride..  Carpe Diem.",

He could spot what part of my body to adjust as I was surfing, which was super helpful. He helped me finally be able to stay with the wave and ride ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™",

He was supportive, helpful and was able to differentiate to the needs of all of us on the boat. With his advice and careful guidance, all of us where able to get up on the board and have lots of fun! We tumbled lots but he was able to guide us back up and move us on really well. I would thoroughly recommend this company. They are responsive, reliable and super friendly. We are definitely coming back for more!! Can't wait. Thank you for making four girls very happy today. You are awesome!",

And that is a mark of a really good coach. He has a great understanding of the line tension and wake dynamics both behind the boat and at the cable park, which I find Invaluable.\n\nOne of the best decisions Iâ€™ve made wakeboarding was to ride at Maxout.",
