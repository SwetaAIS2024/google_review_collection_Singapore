      "text": "Visit date: 6 Mar 2025\nActual rating: 4.0\n\nA sudden craving for fish head curry needed to be answered, so my wifey and I headed to Tai Seng MRT vicinity for dinner...\n\nIt was very crowded at the restaurant, with indoors seating fully taken. We had to settle for outdoors with tables set up along the five foot way üòÜ\n\nThe fish head in claypot came some 20-30 mins after we placed the order online. Served on a burner, it looked like we'd be enjoying at least a warm meal.\n\nStrangely, their curry, while creamy, lacked the expected savoury punch. It appeared they were light on spices that typically flavour such curry sold elsewhere (and not necessarily from Indian stalls)!\n\nI felt that this omission rendered the dish less enjoyable... So much for the \"best in the country\" claim?! ü§îü§£\n\nGranted, they served fresh greens and fish meat -- if there were a top 5 list for fresh fish head curry, they would be in it!\n\nBut their hefty price of $38++ isn't really worth it for the portion size. Perhaps they are well supported by the hype, so no adjustment is needed?\n\nI really dunno, but will hesitate to visit again üòÇ\n\n#MHTamChiak",

Curry gravy is thick, fish portion is reasonable, I didn‚Äôt like that I had the high anticipation of ‚Äú best‚Äù curry fish head and felt really quite normal. The rest of the dishes were okay and not mind blown. The parking is big problem and have to find nearby building to walk over.. one thing to shout out is their service , they are very fast, responsive and helpful in-terms to assisting and ensure customer delight. Will recommend !",
