I loved the jello cocktail with jelly, and the Ching Teng-inspired one was also quite nice. The ambiance was great, with a speakeasy-style vibe.",

      "text": "Decent bar with a nice interior that played early 2010s music.\n\nOrdered 2 sets of drinks - lychee martini and osmanthus martini, both were decently strong. Osmantus martini was a pleasant surprise, it had a sweet and floral taste to it at the start which was then rounded off with a kick of alcohol, making it easy to drink without diminishing the alcohol taste.\n\nGreat that the martinis are affordable as well, compared to most bars in the city area. The only caveat is that their drinks that fall under the \"2 for $xx\" must be the same drink.\n\nService definitely could have been friendlier, but wasn't too terrible. Floor was full of peanut shells though, which was quite odd and not really pleasant to step on especially if they have been littered all over the table's surroundings by previous patrons.",

      "text": "ATMOSPHERE: went on a friday night after 8pm. very crowded so we went to get seats on the 2nd floor. shortly after it got crowded where we were too, and it was really noisy with all the chatter. couldnt hear the music over the noise, much less each other. it has pretty vibey decor, but it didnt feel as cosy as it looked.\n\nSERVICE: it was our first time there, and we asked for recommendations on the food and drinks. it felt like the server was trying to avoid answering our questions. when asked about the serving size on the squid rings, she mentioned \"its not big but can share\"; on the pizza, she replied \"8 slices\". after failing to get her to elaborate on the serving sizes, she finally answered the question on which dish would be more filling between the two. when we wanted to get the bill, it took a lot of effort of waving our arms to get any servers attention. it was exhausting.\n\nFOOD: despite that, the hawaiian pizza really was quite delicious. crispy thin crust, chunky pineapples, savoury sauce and cheese. tabasco sauce was also served without having to ask.\n\nDRINKS: when asked, server recommended their dessert jelly martinis and lychee martini. we asked for more recommendations, but she didnt have much to say. eventually we ordered the chrysanthemum martini, which was decent, but not as special as we hoped. do note that the 2 for $30+ martinis are for the same drink, not two choices under the same category, which we had originally assumed.\n\nunlikely to return!",
