But the economical veg rice stall has a short hair aunty who is very rule, like all eaters own her money. 19 Nov - Dropped two stars from the previous review. Food standard has dropped badly. Ordered the ginger with onion fish rice from the mix rice stall zhi char, I would say this the worst dish I ever had.",
