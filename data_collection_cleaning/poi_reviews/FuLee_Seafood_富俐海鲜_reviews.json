While there were no issues with the chicken, the fish had an unpleasant odor, resembling drain water. Despite informing the staff about the issue, they suggested cooking it longer. Unfortunately, even after the second attempt, the fish still had the same unpleasant taste. When we sought assistance again, the staff chose to ignore our concerns !!",

Ambience was quite okay since here is a kopitiam or food court. Very bright lights and many bright colors sign boards. Service was prompt and friendly. Price wise was on the affordable side especially  their promotional dish was a steal. Foodwise was good and much better than the average standards. However still can't compare to the restaurant standards. Portion was just right for the average  person. Overall a good dining experience over at the food court which has a lot more food variety to offer. So a strong 3 stars for me.",
