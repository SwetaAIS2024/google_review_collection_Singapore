Sah Vargas,2,"Weird. Checked-in with my dad and I was accompanied by my sister but she was not allowed to go up to the hotel room because they said only 2 people are allowed. She did told them that she will just accompany us but WILL NOT STAY. They still did not allowed, which was never a problem in any hotel I stayed in. Asked my friends about it, twas the first time them hearing it too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105061313796192188023/reviews
Jay Lee,5,"One of the best hotels at its price point—clean, well-maintained, and equipped with everything you need. Service was outstanding. Accidentally dropped the showerhead, and it broke, but the staff responded immediately. Everything was fixed in less than five minutes. Truly impressive efficiency! Special thanks to Ann for her excellent service. Will definitely return!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114520250625775672952/reviews
Maynard,5,"Several times I have been here. The staff were friendly and kind.
Overall, the room is okay. Sometimes I get a room that isn't that clean, but it's still tolerable.
The one I didn't like is the thin wall; I can hear someone talking from the adjacent room and walking in the corridor.
There are minimarkets around the hotel and hawker centers nearby (5-10 mins walk). Also bus stop infront of the hotel.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101704824479639506422/reviews
Nistha Singh,5,"For the price you are paying, I can bet you cannot find any better place to stay. This is THE best budget hotel. Sure room is not the fanciest, but they had a clean queen bed. I stayed at no window queen bed room, and i found the space sufficient. They provided a hair dryer. Got new body wash, shampoo and dental kit everyday. Also cleaned room everyday too. I would definitely give it a 5 but again for the price you are paying, they are literally making every penny worth.

The best thing is definitely the location. I see a lot of people complained about the grab drop off. The simple solution i found to this was getting a grab to “The mezzo” which is just in front of the hotel so all you have to do is cross the road. Thats what i did. Saved me time. For getting around the city, the bus top is literally right outside. I took the bus everyday. There is a umart and cheers and a lot of places to eat in walking distance.

Overall had a great experience staying for 2 nighta",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102146572562448090652/reviews
RAHUL GUPTA,4,"Rooms are small at the price but I think it’s because Singapore is expensive and it’s like that maybe .

Apart from room being small everything was good

Location is just in front of BLK104 bus stand and you can access bus Or MRT easily from here was very easy for me to travel in the city.

Reception people are good they greet you and help you if you ask.
It was raining out they offered umbrella by themselves and also allowed little early check in.

I only found room to be too small else everything is perfect
Got it for 350SGD for 3 days 21000 approx Indian rupees.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114233192991599614243/reviews
