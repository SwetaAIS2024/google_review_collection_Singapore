Cassia A,4,"The Korean stall is good but a bit expensive. The bibimbap, kimchi soup, and soybean soup are all good. Healthy options too.
The soybean soup is a really good vegetarian option. And the portion is really big.
The ban mian is really good and cheap.
Thereâ€™s neverrrr seats at this canteen around dinner time",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117662481746295955146/reviews

Angelin,5,"In my opinion, one of the top 3 best canteen in NTU. Ayam penyet is my favorite, especially the sambal (chilli). Must buy early cause sometimes it's sold out. Other stalls like Korean, Mala, Indian are famous too. I also recommend the milo or teh bing here!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105417076759937799330/reviews

Eugene Ng,1,"Came back to try the Korean food but realised the owner had changed. Now it serves measly portions. Food in picture cost $7.8? 30 cents for dabao. Wasn't as good as it used to be anymore... Didn't see an option to add cheese as well, which is really saddening :(",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118327954971291330623/reviews
