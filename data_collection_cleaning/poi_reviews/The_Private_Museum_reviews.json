      "text": "The current exhibition at this venue didn't quite appeal to me, but the history of the house, spanning from the 1800s to the present, was fascinating. The toilets were also notably impressive. However, the location is a bit of a drawback, as it's quite a distance from any public transport and requires a hike up a small hill to reach this otherwise gorgeous house.\n\nAdditionally, there aren't any amenities around, so be sure to bring some water to keep yourself hydrated. Though the museum does offer some light refreshments in exchange for a donation.",
