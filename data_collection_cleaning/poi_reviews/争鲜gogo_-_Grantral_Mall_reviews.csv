lucas oh,1,"As a customer, I respect your store hours and understand that your staff need to go home. However, being told I can’t purchase pre-packed sushi that’s already sitting on the shelf — just because “we’re closed” — raises a few questions. Are these items going to be thrown away, or simply re-labeled as “fresh” for tomorrow’s customers? If it’s the latter, that’s not just wasteful — it borders on misleading and unfair business practice.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106936167860774543223/reviews

Rach,3,"Got the aburi salmon🐟🍱 and crabstick mayo🦀 sushi and while I enjoyed the salmon sushi, the crabstick one was a letdown as it clearly wasn’t freshly made (rice was super hard, crumbly and dry🙁 tho the crabstick tasted fine; didn’t finish in the end and threw some away). Was initially concerned about freshness as some reviews mentioned food poisoning after consumption😳 but I guess the cooked ones are safer to try! Price-wise this is definitely much more affordable than other brands😂",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100368288078910287205/reviews
Gator,3,Decent shop focusing on low cost operation and fast in fast out customers. Food was ok and nothing to shout about. Price was competitive vs other brands due to its operational model. Have to eat fast after takeaway to prevent the food from going bad in the hot and humid weather here in Singapore.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
Freddy Tan,3,Bought a nice box of Salmon Sushi Fiesta Box and was enjoying it with my wife. However one of the Salmon Floral Sushi had a bone in it. Fortunately my wife took it out of her mouth and was not injured. See pictures,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107332268050050744721/reviews
