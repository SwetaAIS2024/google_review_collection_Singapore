And her mentor and school counsellor helped to reach out to make her feel at ease.  Also the parent association is very united and supportive. They arrange occasional catch up in the mornings with the Principal to share updates and gather feedback. Would certainly recommend the school.",

      "text": "Such a normal school in all the right ways.  Small class sizes, welcoming staff, caring teachers, strong pastoral care system and values.  Opportunities to try and take part in lots of different CCAs without needing to be a world champion.  No huge fancy campus, but well equipped classrooms filled with student's work and colour. They get great academic results, without being too academically selective, because the children are empowered, happy, and taught well.  If only more schools could be like this, and the planet may be a happier place.  If you are looking at other top schools like SJI-I, think again and try out ACS-I too.  It's a pleasant change.",

We loved the camderie and eloquent students at ACSI who took us through the school and explained the process. Once we decided to enroll. The process was seemless, with proactive follow up from school admin. We look forward to  good holistic experience. The results year on year has improved for the IB too, well done.\nNext stop, University.",
