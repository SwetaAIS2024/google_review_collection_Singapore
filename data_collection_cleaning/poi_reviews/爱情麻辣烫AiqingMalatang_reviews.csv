Gator,5,"I stumbled upon this simple restaurant while searching for a dinner spot, and Iâ€™m so glad I did! This restaurant offers a fantastic Mala soup experience, and hereâ€™s why I highly recommend it:

There are several soup bases to choose from, and I opted for the classic Mala broth. The broth was incredibly flavorfulâ€”spicy, aromatic, and deeply satisfying. It had the perfect balance of heat and richness, making every bite enjoyable.

The free condiments counter was well-stocked with a variety of sauces, fresh coriander, and chili. This allowed me to customize my dipping sauce to my liking, which added an extra layer of fun and personalization to the meal.

The restaurant has a clean, comfortable, and inviting environment. The seating was spacious, and the overall atmosphere made for a relaxing dining experience. Itâ€™s a great place to enjoy a meal with friends or family.

This shop just opened a few weeks ago. We continue to believe that  every new shop having one chance to impress us, ðŸ˜„ and tried the foods in this store.

First we did not see the price tags so we just selected a few ingredients for the mala ban (dry mala sauce and peanut taste in it). Once we tasted the food, we decided to go with another bowl and this time with bone broth. Also have peanut taste. Interesting favor.

The lady boss came to check on us for the taste of their food. During our conversation, she realized by herself that some people may be allergic to peanuts.

MSG level ok.
