Peter Chua,4,"Qiao Di Kopitiam is known for its traditional Malaysian noodle dishes. Their menu features a variety of options, including the signature Wan Tan Mee for its authentic taste. Another popular choice is the Hakka Fried Pork Mee, combining flavorful fried pork with noodles.
However, they do provide a variety of sides that might interest patrons, such as Fried Wan Tan, Fried Dumplings, and Ipoh Egg Stew.

Overall, Qiao Di Kopitiam offers a range of noodle-based dishes and sides that cater to diverse tastes, making it a notable spot for those seeking traditional Malaysian flavors.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117320083836989480538/reviews
KL Chai,5,"Love the dry Char Siew wonton noodles with wonton soup.
The red bean black glutinous rice desert is good too, not too sweet.
Will sure come back again. ðŸ˜‹",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109341284780368097167/reviews
Eugene Toh,5,"Great Value Takeaway!

Picked up a nasi lemak from Qiao Di Kopitiam @ Eco Botanic and was pleasantly surprised. Generous portion, well-fried chicken, perfectly runny egg, and that crispy ikan bilis hit the spot. For the price, itâ€™s definitely value for money. Great flavour, no frillsâ€”just good food done right.

Highly recommend if you're in the area and need a hearty takeaway!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103445469996684578682/reviews
Yun Xiang,4,"Local dishes here.

Ordered the dry curry chicken mee. There is 2 pieces of medium size meat and 1 piece of potato. It's decent.

Kopi also taste decent.

They also sell boxes of Kueh here which is not in menu. Looks like factory made.

Payment by cards not ready !!!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100471045446290739173/reviews
Junior Hsu,4,Good atmosphere and free parking . The signature Wan Tan noodles are great but the Kaya toast is a bit let down .,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109194187981877064256/reviews
