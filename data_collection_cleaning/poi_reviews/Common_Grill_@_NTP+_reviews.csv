Empowering Mindset,4,"The area offers variety of food and alcohol as it was located in a food court. The food ordered was really good. I felt worth the price for the food quality I had. The pizza was also very good with the cheese on it, the dough is crispy and springy at the same time. Even better when I dip it with the mushroom source I have from another dish ordered.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113009080732159136694/reviews

Jin Yong,1,"Chicken chop tasted weirdly sour with a strange after taste. They were kind enough to cook another one for me, but the 2nd one had the same problem.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115160392341067523053/reviews
Christopher Tan,1,"DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE! Although service was not bad as they allowed me to change my side salad to corn, I am truly disappointed by the subpar food despite the extorbitant prices! I paid $15.90 for the Iberico Pork Truffle Burger with Coleslaw as my side dish. When the food came, it would be an understatement to say that I was severely underwhelmed by the portion of the food. The size of the burger was so small that I could literally finish it in 4 mouthfuls. Furthermore, the pork patty was so dry I thought a drought had occurred and dried the pigs to death in iberico! The meat was so tough to chew, and my jaw was hurting by the time I had finished my meal. The picture in the menu also showed a rather generous amount of mushrooms in the burger, but when my burger was served I was struggling to find a single trace of mushrooms. The chef must have been hungry, but the pork was so dry so he must have decided to eat the mushrooms instead. At least there was a little truffle sauce which improved the flavour of the burger. Moving on, I definitely expected a larger portion of coleslaw considering the price I'm paying so it was a huge disappointment to see that the staff had to be stingy even over a vegetable side. Flavour of the coleslaw was ok, nothing special, which I would expect from a dish that cost me $15.90 in a food court. Lastly, the corn. Did a drought occur in the cornfields too? I expected fresh juicy corn but was met with corn that seemed to have come from a dry aged fridge meant for meat. There was also no seasoning on the corn, tasteless. Was expecting at least a little butter to enhance the flavour, but even that had to be compromised. All in all, please do not waste your money on this stall that does not care about customer welfare but would rather increase their profit margins for their own benefit. Extremely selfish behaviour and I hope that things will change for the better, but until then, I will leave my review here for potential future victims to take note so that fewer people would fall victim to this stall's predatory tactics. Avoid at all costs.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109404394182651989148/reviews
