Most of the bad reviews here would be first-timers highlighting their demeanor which can come off as rude and \"dao\" because they don't speak much, literally. But regulars would know that's how they are - men of few words.\n\nBut you're not here for top-notch customer service, you're here because their food is delicious and affordable. If I ever die, I want their chicken wings to be my last meal - boneless, juicy and oh so succulent. Very generous portions of bee hoon and try their porridge while you're at it. Simple but has a tasty umami richness.\n\nCome early because there's usually a queue. And if you're a jiak kan tang like me, its a good idea to rehearse what to order while waiting in line.",

Dad and son team dished out yummy dishes. Best chicken wing ever. They de-boned the chicken wing before frying. Eat with their fried bee hoon damn shiok! 白暂鸡also can eat.",
