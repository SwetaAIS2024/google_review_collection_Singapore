Leona B.StopCopyMi,5,"Thank you to Bethany Presbyterian Church and Pastor and Pastor Wife Samantha, and also to our dear brothers and sisters in Christ, which I don't even know you and your church.

During these times of sorrow, your unwavering support for my family has deeply touched our hearts. It was truly a pleasant surprise that, with just one call from my aunt, you sprang into action with unconditional love. Your willingness to stand in the gap, assemble a small team, and shower us with love through your affirming words provided us with the support that we needed the most. Not all or individual will do that, thank you.

May the Lord bless you and your church abundantly.

Thank you so much
