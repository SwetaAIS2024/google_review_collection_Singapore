Not crowded. I went on Sun morning and it was quiet. I prefer the less crowded ambience to really enjoy the food and place.",

      "text": "The coffee here is absolutely delicious. The classic black has no acidity at all — just clean, smooth, and rich in flavor. The outdoor terrace has a lovely atmosphere, and the interior is just as cozy and inviting. The lemon zesty pound cake was truly impressive — a perfect balance of citrus and sweetness. Highly recommended!",

Service was attentive and the staff brought the menu and water to the table right away.\n\nIced mocha RM19 was lacklustre, looked and tasted like an iced latte. Baked basque cheese cake RM20 was tasty.\n\nReception is poor inside, if you're looking to work or use the internet, make sure to sit closer to the door.",

Then we ordered a bagel with chicken, it came with the fried sweet potatoes.\n\nMSG level is acceptable.\n\nPlace to revisit.",
