      "text": "Royal Vopak N.V. (Dutch: Koninklijke Vopak) is a Dutch company that stores and handles various oil, chemicals, edible oils and natural gas-related products. The company was created by the merger of Van Ommeren and Pakhoed in 1999. In 2002, the distribution of oil and natural gas related products was split off; a new company Univar was created for that purpose. The head office is located in Rotterdam.\n\nIn 2018, Vopak celebrates 35 years of progress in Singapore. From one terminal with just about 30 tanks in 1983 to five terminals with nearly 500 tanks today, Vopak Terminals Singapore has grown into a leading tank storage services provider at a major hub location with over 350 professionals, storing vital products from oil, chemicals to gases through our network of terminals with care.",
