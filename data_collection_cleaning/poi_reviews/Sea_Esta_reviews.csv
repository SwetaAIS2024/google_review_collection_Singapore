Tony Mahony,5,I came here to visit my friend . The condo has a very good swimming pools and it's 2 storey above one another. The entrance to the block is far and it's not from the swimming pool area which makes it annoying. The rest is okay for me as I'm not staying here,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105558371280552733245/reviews
Syahirah Salim,2,"It’s a lovely albeit small-ish condominium with pretty well-maintained buildings and facilities located on a relatively newly built road on Pasir Ris Link.

Also located near-ish to Downtown East, and to the Pasir Ris Park and beach, which I think is the biggest perk of this place.

The pros stop there, however. The condo managment could definitely do better to be less unkind, especially to visitors. Having lived here for 5 years, complaints about how the guards were rude to them is a common one from family and friends who visit our home.

At the height of covid, delivery riders and cyclists who delivered our food and groceries often lamented that they were asked to park their vehicles at the very front entrance and walk all the way in into our houses. The problem is compounded even more when it happens to be raining because much, if not all of the walkable grounds surrounding the blocks are unsheltered. No exceptions were made. This policy seem to endure and continue even long after covid was no longer the pandemic it once was.

I had tried writing an email to the management office regarding this matter, having relied on grocery shopping online a ton during the early covid period. Food deliveries were generally more manageable; but riders delivering groceries were lugging kilos and kilos of groceries to our homes on foot, when they could easily go down to the underground Carpark and parked nearest to our blocks. Unfortunately, my pleas to management fell on deaf ears mostly. The management’s reply was that it would cause many riders to take advantage of the parking and leave their bikes parked there overnight. Which I don’t understand at all?

What’s worse is that they don’t even request residents with bicycles to properly park and arrange their bikes in a neat, orderly manner.

Additionally, I used the gym quite frequently and decided to hire a private trainer to help train me up further during my sessions. However, the few times my trainer was there, a particularly uncouth resident who happened to always use the gym the same time as us spoke to us so rudely to leave the gym when she wasn’t even using any equipment, merely just instructing me the moves. This happened on a few different occasions and usually ends up with security chasing both of us out of the gym.

I don’t get why swimming instructors are allowed to hold private swimming lessons for the kids here, and yet my trainer couldn’t do the same with my training sessions at the gym. A bit of a double standard, isn’t it?

Some of the guards there are gems but yeah for the most part, the day guards always seem to be on some power trip.

Would be a nicer place to live at if not for all these weird, unnecessarily strict rules. The people who management should be trying to protect us from are probably other rude and entitled residents.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113183742620258086704/reviews
Seahawk Toad,1,"This is a weird construction. Even though I looks good on the outset, only after moving in we’ve realised various faults. For example, kitchen countertop leveling is faulty and water from the sink flows over the countertop back to the stove. Similar leveling issues in bathrooms too. Water flows in the opposite direction of the drain. The tap water was once muddy as well, so very wary about it being portable!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110504212677981896301/reviews
renato yap,1,Horrible maintenance if ANY of the tennis court . These photos were taken when it was dry the whole day ..it only rained yesterday and stopped in the afternoon. 24 hours later it's still puddle up with scum and mould because there's no maintenance on the court .

Lim Hian Kiat,5,"Great location for activities being close to Pasir Ris Park. Great convenience whenever we want to do our grocery runs as Downtown East is mere minutes away. Well maintained, serenity and peace. Close to good schools too like Hai Sing and Pasir Ris Primary.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100149906062312702177/reviews
