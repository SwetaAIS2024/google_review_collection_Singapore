There were so many activities and booths around, and it was such fun and pleasure to be at the place!\n\nThoroughly enjoyed my 1-day outing to the campus, where students and staff alike are very welcoming, friendly, and awesome! Thank you NUS :)\n\nP.S. itâ€™s a great time to visit on weekends just to walk around and admire the architecture of the campus!",

It has many fast food and hawker centre food options and has some residents hall for students to stay in near the campus. It is accessible via mrt and bus within a 15 minutes walk. There is a central Plaza in the centre of the school where many gatherings take place.",

This campus is the combination of the any modern shopping mall (e.g. vibocity) and a decent forest. One can enjoyed these both feeling once he/she inside of it. Everything is heavily organized and the campus is so bug that you can not visit the entire campus in a single day. The campus is full of stairs and that's why sometimes it is called national university of Stairs.",
