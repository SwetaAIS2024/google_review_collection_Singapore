She is able to use different techniques to help improve my singing - techniques that I have not learnt before from other singing workshops that I've been to.\n\nYvette has taught me to achieve what I thought I couldn't do! :)",

She really helped me change the way I was singing, taught me how to open my throat, position my palate and use my core muscles to get more power. Sometimes I am very suprised at the fact I can belt high notes.\nYvette is very profesional and a pleasant teacher, and the fact she performs as a live singer all the time make her advice so relevant and to the point.\nI very much recommend her.",

She is able to tailor class content according to your preferences and goals. (Whether it is for examination, audition, leisure).  Classes are fun and fulfilling. It is an enjoyment to attend her private class. I have improved my singing from beginner to a diploma level. It was a rewarding journey. This includes tonal control, pitch, managing a good sounding vibrato, proper breathing and support, aural, sight-singing skills. I am grateful and contented with the outcome of my singing after years of lessons with her.",

These proper singing techniques have also resulted in eliminating all nasal-ness from my voice which I was previously struggling heavily with.\n\nDon’t hesitate anymore and contact her today if you are looking for a great vocal coach! Thank you Yvette for being patient and understanding throughout my journey with you!",

You won’t regret it, I definitely didn’t!",
