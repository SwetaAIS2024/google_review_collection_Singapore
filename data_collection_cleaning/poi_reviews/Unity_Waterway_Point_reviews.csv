Evonne Yeo,1,I will give a no star if there's an option. The lady pharmacist was so impatient and roll her eyes when I was merely asking her a few questions about medication for sore throat which takes her less than 3 minutes. I would surely not patronise this store again.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114630622266169972372/reviews
Joel Ee,1,"Bad service. My wife went to do her refund and had to suffer sarcastic remarks by staff Jenny and Zhiying.

Especially Jenny, her repeated sarcastic remarks are very disrespectful when she merely just wanted to refund an item which is valid for a refund. Jenny should also improve on her attitude, customer service and knowledge to process refund.

Zhiying processed her refund, but before processing , she gave all kinds of reasons. Since she is the store in charge , she should know how to process the refund.

It's sad that the customer are treated this way. Really hope that the service will improve in the future.

First time we encountered such bad service in Singapore, hope there won't be a next time. Sigh..",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114040000249113727189/reviews
