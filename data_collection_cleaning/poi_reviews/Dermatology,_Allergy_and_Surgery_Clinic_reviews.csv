Violetttes,1,"Experience from making an appointment till consultation did not made me felt that my problem was resolved nor listen to. I wasn’t even treated nor my complain was heard with the doctor.

Counter staff wasn’t professional too, the registration felt like a transaction rather than being welcomed like a concerned patient. Never step in again!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113832601323729215150/reviews

Jeannie Ho,5,"Dr Henry Loh is very caring and patient with my recent visit to his clinic. This is my first time to this clinic and I highly recommend him to other patients. Feeling much better after one week of taking the antibiotics and ointment for my face, caused by an inexperienced beautician who did the facial for me. Thank you Dr Henry Loh.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108155440752639871740/reviews
