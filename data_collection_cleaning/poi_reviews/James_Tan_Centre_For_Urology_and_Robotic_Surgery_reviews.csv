pk a,5,Dr James Tan is an experienced doctor who gives confidence to patients.  My elderly dad is impressed with his medical expertise and decisive responses to questions put to him. Very glad that my elderly dad's condition improved greatly after seeing him.  His charges are reasonable and I highly recommend Dr James Tan for anyone who needs to consult a good urologist.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116138029580205284850/reviews
Josh,1,"I had a bad experience with Dr. James Tan (Urology) when he was with Mount Elizabeth. I had a very small kidney stone and he nudged me to do an invasive  procedure costs around 8,000SGD and gave me discomfort for a long period of time. When the procedure was done he could not find the stone as it had already passed through urine. Most doctors said they would never do the procedure for such a small stone and would let it pass through urine and give some medication as aid. I would not recommend Dr. Tan to anyone who is looking for a doctor who puts patients before profits.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104683346357396389631/reviews
