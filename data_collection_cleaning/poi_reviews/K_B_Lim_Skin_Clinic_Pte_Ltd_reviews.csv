丛良,1,"This ""Dr. Lin"" made my face bad. (1) I made an appointment to go to the clinic to see him, but he still refused to see me and told me to go home and wait for a call. This is an obvious shirking of responsibility and irresponsibility.
(2) The assistant said that seeing ""Dr. Lin"" would cost $180 in outpatient fees. I asked her how the spots on my face were damaged by ""Dr. Lin"" and asked ""Dr. Lin"" how to solve them. It's unethical for this store to charge more. I paid $911.20 for a spot treatment, and I would like to ask how such a ""medical aesthetic doctor"" can do this to consumers?
(3) After my insistence, I finally met “Dr. Lin” himself. As a doctor, in order to evade responsibility, “Dr. Lin” actually told me not to come to him again next time, saying that I was too troublesome and asked me to find another doctor. (You must know why I am looking for you because you ruined my face.)
(4) Before the treatment, my spots were not obvious at all, just a little bit. During the consultation, ""Dr. Lin,"" you asked me where the spots were? I also pointed out to you that my first sentence was to ask you if it can be removed? ""Dr. Lin"" you said yes, because I trust you, you are doing this to me now. If you are not good at medical skills, don't deceive consumers.
(5) Shirk the responsibility and say that I didn’t buy your ointment. (Dr. Lin, why didn’t you tell me honestly during the consultation that if I didn’t apply your so-called ointment, it would turn black and enlarge? If I knew the consequences, I would not let you touch my face. The skin was damaged because of your improper operation at the time, and it is now uneven.) Ask “Dr. Lin” what should you do?
(6) The last and most irritating thing is that ""Dr. Lin"" you had the nerve to let me spend more money to buy your so-called ointment, but you did not solve it for me because of your poor skills and damaged my skin. This attitude is really unethical. In the end, you were reluctant to give me a small jar of ointment with no ingredients and no name. When I asked ""Dr. Lin"" how to use it, you still impatiently told me to go out and wait for someone to talk to me. With such an attitude, no one who understands such technology in the future would dare to go.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115520326875248759049/reviews
