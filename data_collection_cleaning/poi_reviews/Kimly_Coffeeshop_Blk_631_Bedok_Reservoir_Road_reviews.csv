Max S.,2,"This review is for the zichar stall which I will not recommend.

Tried the fried rice and lala beehoon and both were very substandard. Fried rice only had egg as ingredient and the chicken was tough. The lala beehoon seems to be over cooked and the taste was really not great.

Very disappointed.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101834880193042109600/reviews

Mei Kei,1,"14/10/2023 - I bought kopi o beng at Kimly coffee shop around 3.20pm, after I finish the drink, saw that‚Äôs insect inside. And the tall,slim,short hair auntie(who‚Äôs make the drink for me) was very rude, she keeps saying the insect failling from outside, none of their business, and won‚Äôt apologize to me ! Oh ya, she also said ‚ÄúIf want to complain please go ahead and complain !‚Äù üôÇ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104164749262608185465/reviews
