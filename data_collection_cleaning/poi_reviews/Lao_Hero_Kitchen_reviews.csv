Moses -,2,"Recently, I had the chance to visit  this restaurant. It was crowded with people, and we had to wait a short while to be seated. The restaurant service was not up to the mark as the server was inexperienced and didn't seem to know what to do. The service was slow, and it took us more than half an hour to get our food served, even though we arrived early.

The black pepper crab, which was supposed to be the restaurant's signature dish, was overcooked and not very fresh. The taste was average, and it didn't live up to its hype. The best dish we ordered was the vegetable dish, which was delicious.

The fish maw soup disappointed us, and the prawns were not very fresh. It was the least worth ordering.

The restaurant had an upmarket and elegant setup, but the food quality and service standards didn't match up. It could be a concern for those who are short on time due to the slow service.

On the bright side, the restaurant had a clean toilet, which was a good experience. Overall, the restaurant wasn't a great dining experience, but it was worth it if you're in the mood for good veggies or a clean restroom",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113666852570724472966/reviews
Joy Lim,4,"2nd time visiting this restaurant at Jalan Kayu.

Serving local zichar and china cuisine.

Most of the dishes tasted good and it suits my family ðŸ˜Š Tried the curry fish head this time, the fish is really fresh and reasons fish meat. It also had cabbage,long beans,lady fingers and taupok. Signature tofu is a must try dish too!

Very close to my place for a decent zichar food. Environment is better indoor with Aircon, if you only got the outdoor seats there is fan so not to worry.

Apparently they are always short handed of staff so be patience with them.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112272825302491064686/reviews
Alex Tee,5,"Food is nice and serve hot. Taste is good for food. Service is excellent. Only thing is small restaurant. Would be good if can have more round table as we family of 7 sitting on long table we have to pass the food around for all. Overall staff service & food is nice. Payment can only use paynow, paylah or nets(no credit card).",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105620750100273412782/reviews
Collin Wong,5,"Absolutely delighted with the food! Every dish is prepared with care and attention to detail, making each bite a joy. We ordered cabbage, fish, tomato eggs, and chickenâ€”everything was incredibly fresh and full of flavor. A truly satisfying meal!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100024133528446159261/reviews
Erica,4,"Nice little ç…®ç‚’, air-conditioned, neat and clean. We had deep fried squid, tofu and broccoli. The prices may be steeped compared to coffee-shop prices but I think it is worthwhile as it is after all air-conditioned. I like it that the food isn't salty or taste like msg. The tofu was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. As I don't eat pork, I simply scrapped the pork toppings from the tofu. I appreciate that the waitress is service-oriented. She was attentive and the food were served very promptly. Oh yes, their barley was homemade without the canned drink type of taste. We'll definitely be back!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101588123935069178694/reviews
