Forest BK,5,"üç±The expansive grass field atop the Marina Barrage roof is a favourite picnic ground and kite flying haven since the Barrage""s debut.
üç±The constant blowing sea breeze is ideal for kite flying.
üç±The unblocked panoramic view and flat spacious grass field is undoubtably a choice location for picnic seekers.
üç±Marina Barrage Green Roof can be crowded on weekend evenings.
üç±It's easily accessible. Nearest MRT is Gardens by the Bay Station.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Lloyd Smyth,5,"Wonderful morning views over the Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands and the City Skyline. A gentle inclined spiral pathway takes you from ground level up the Green viewing platform. However, If you are doing a running loop, this will lead to a dead end! You will find the Barrage Bridge on the ground level on the South East side.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110351636094658664935/reviews

Vincent Lok,4,"Definitely a must go place if you want to see nice night scene in Singapore. 360 view of all the CBD, attraction places (esplanade, MBS, Garden by the bay etc) on the other hand then you can see the other side of the connector that can lead you to Stadium and East Coast Park! Take lift of climb up the stairs and walk around the pathway slowly down.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110446806758076047141/reviews
