Ben Koh,5,"Certainly! Here‚Äôs a short and simple 5-star review for a haircut experience:

Exquisite Style at Zenn Salon

I recently visited Zenn Salon for a haircut and was thoroughly impressed. The ambiance was inviting, the service impeccable, and the haircut itself was flawless. My stylist crafted a look that was both trendy and suitable for my personality. I left feeling rejuvenated and confident. Zenn Salon truly delivered a five-star experience!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103736340972465029402/reviews
Felicia Tan,1,"Charge my niece for a 10minute trimming of hair  28 dollars at adult price. She is only 11+ Years old.  but they refuse to charge child rate.

Price was not made known prior to cut. And hair cut was Super uneven. Usually prior to cutting the stylist would spray some water to wet the hair but they did not even do so. Just started sniping away immediately. And when I complained the stylist said nobody cuts so even. üò°",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105797513599018008078/reviews
Till Tayo,1,my worst experience with this place by far. DO NOT LOOK FOR ‚ÄúKELLY‚Äù cause she is absolutely atrocious. Explicitly told her to cut my fringe till the mid of my eyebrow length and even SHOWED her photos of how I want it done. After completely botching the hairstyle and making my hair look like a complete coconut. She still has the audacity to tell me it looks nice and this is how the haircut should be done and proceeded to charge me $23 dollars. Absolutely ridiculous,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115443212153566234369/reviews
farahwhy,5,"One of the best places to get my hair done at my neighbour! I would always book a reservation under a lady named ""Kelly"". She provides efficient service & recommended me a suitable hair colour. She's friendly too ‚ò∫Ô∏è 100% recommended :) Did a haircut, with treatment & highlights. I can say it's affordable.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109879466169457826438/reviews
The Parrot Pictures LLP,1,"Saw one of their own stylist with a nice haircut so I approached her to ask who cut her hair for her. She said it's by their lady boss Susan. Confident that she can deliver the same (a good hair cut) for me, I booked her at 6.50pm. She confidently told me she would definitely be ready when I reached. Ended up I waited until 7.15pm. This is not a very key issue, if her skills are good. I showed her couple of pics that I shortlisted...Susan sounded like ""there's nothing to cut at all if I had to follow those styles I had chosen."" So I seek her advice.... She showed me some shots and we agree to go for one of them. Ended up what she cut is far from what the pic was. And my sides also not balanced. The worse is most stylist would cut the sides for pixie look....she uses a shaver. She should go back to school and relearn everything.
I go to QB before....even QB stylist did a better job than Susan and she charge $23 for a cut while QB only $12.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104842905488634050898/reviews
