I think they need to better manage the expectations by informing customers of the waiting time before they place their orders + give buzzers/number tags as I see the staff getting confused about the orders too.\n\nBut the one dish we tried was good so we will patronise again!",

Like whutttt? Luckily the food was yummy.\n\nSide note, they prolly have different chefs who cook with different ingredients for the same dish. It was still good nonetheless.

Food was tasty, esp the fish head curry! We went to the nearby bakery to get a loaf of bread to dip into the curry. Cereal prawn, shrimp roll, signature tofu, prawn paste chix wings, long beans and the 3 eggs veges were all tasty and not much use of MSG.",
