It is valued for money and so tasty.\n\nMy favourite part is the side house-made tofu, so soft and umami with minced meat gravy.\n\nThe chicken thigh is tender. It contains a bit of soft bones but no issue for me.\n\nThe chilli sauce is good too, enough kick but not overly spicy.\n\nI would definitely eat here again if I am in the area. Recommended!",

      "text": "Decided to get the chicken rice from Five Star today since we were nearby. We ordered roasted chicken rice, white chicken wing rice and Thai tofu.\n\nLet‚Äôs review first in the tofu\n- it‚Äôs fried to perfection with sweet Thai chilli sauce.\n- it‚Äôs yummy but must eat while it‚Äôs piping hot üòã\n- abit pricy for 4 small pieces of tofu, not value for $$$\n\nThe roasted chicken is acceptable though nothing special to note about. They given me breast meat and luckily it‚Äôs not as tough as I thought.\nThe white chicken wing wasn‚Äôt de-bone to our surprised but it tasted quite ok.\nWe were disappointed with the rice, soft but not fragrant as in other chicken rice stall.\nThe chilli for the chicken rice is tasty & spicy ang guess that makes the food abit tastier.\n\nWill I visit again? Perhaps not so soon. There are many places that sell better chicken rice than them üòù",

The roast chicken was so-so, the broccoli was not bad, but the fish soup was very bland. As they are located along a stretch of road of eateries, they will need to up their game if they want to stay competitive.",

Nice to come with a bigger group to try their other dishes. I liked the cereal prawn, and the hometown tofu is also usually really good too!",
