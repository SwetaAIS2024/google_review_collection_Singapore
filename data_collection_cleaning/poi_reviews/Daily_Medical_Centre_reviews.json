She has lots of experience as well.\n\nShe gave me very good advice when my blood pressure reading taken in the clinic were high. Good and complete advice on how to monitor for a week at home, what type of blood pressure monitor to get, stop eating hawker food, eat home cooked food low in sodium at home how to meditate. In a few days time, my blood pressure were back to normal.",

She has vast knowledge and understanding when it comes to health, medicine, mindset and diet.\n\nShe‚Äôs the only one who would give you non medical prescriptions along with medicine and I find that fantastic.\n\nShe takes a lot of care and time for each and every patient. Everytime I am in there, it would be super crowded but everyone is just there, sitting quietly and patiently, waiting to see her.\n\nI never liked doctors to begin with in the first place, but Dr Seet changed my mind. I am a convert now and would only go to see her for my problems cause I just don‚Äôt trust any other doctor.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a clean freak and impatient, please do not see her. There are already too many people waiting to see her on a daily basis and she really works very hard. Please don‚Äôt go and ruin the experience for everyone, thank you üôèüèª",
