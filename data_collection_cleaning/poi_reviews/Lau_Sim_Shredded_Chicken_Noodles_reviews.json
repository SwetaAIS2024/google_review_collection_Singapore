Noodles are OK, but what's truly fantastic are their handmade Teochew fish balls and Teochew Har Giao, which is both flavourful and chewy. I like how chewy their Har Giao are and the owners said extra time is taken to ensure it's chewyness. Regulars continue to patronise this stall, which recently reopened. Hopeful to continue patronising this stall if possible!",

Do opt for upsize if you have a big appetite. The stall owner is the pioneer of Karenâ€™s diner. Do expect some attitude from him if you are first time visiting this stall. ðŸ˜‘",

      "text": "Heard alot about this stall over at Toa Payoh west Hawker centre that sells shredded chicken noodle. I was quite lucky as I managed to buy the last bowl of the day before they call it a day.\n\nApperantly they are famous for their handmade fish dumpling. A bowl of noodle starts from SGD$3 onwards, i had the shredded chicken fish dumpling noodle which was SGD$4.\n\nNoodle was nicely cooked and texture was springy. The sauce could be more savoury. Quite unique to have shredded chicken instead of the usual minced pork. The fish dumpling is indeed special and different from the one you commonly find outside\n\nOverall, its was a average bowl of noodle, nothing special that I would come all the way just to eat.",
