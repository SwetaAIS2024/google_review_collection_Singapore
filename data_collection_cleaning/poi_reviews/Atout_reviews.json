      "text": "Upon arrival we proceed to select our preferred wine for lunch from a small but well-curated cellar featuring a mix of old and new world selections. The selection, while not extensive, was respectable and provided enough variety to suit different preferences.\nWhile we were tempted to explore more of the menu, we focused on the cold and hot appetizers. The monkfish liver—often called the “foie gras of the sea” was a standout, boasting a smooth, creamy texture that melted effortlessly on the palate. In contrast, the duck rillette, rich in fat, presented an entirely different yet equally indulgent experience, offering a deep, savory flavor that reset the senses after the monkfish liver.\nMoving on to the hot starters, the escargots were baked in a fragrant garlic butter that was impossible to resist, especially when paired with bread to soak up every last drop of the flavorful sauce. The chorizo sausages were another highlight, boasting a coarse texture and a well-balanced spice profile. Unlike many places where chorizo is served overly dry, these were perfectly moist and among the best I’ve had in Singapore. The beef tartare was yet another well-executed dish, made with high-quality beef and seasoned to achieve that unmistakable note of indulgence.\nTo finish, we opted for a cheese platter and grilled peppers, both of which were enjoyable. However, the meal was not without its shortcomings. Our first bread basket included a decent sourdough, but alongside it was an inexplicably dry, hard-to-swallow piece that felt entirely out of place. Even more surprising was the absence of a proper baguette—an essential staple in any French dining experience. When we requested more bread, only the sourdough remained an acceptable option.Given the quality of their charcuterie and appetizers, the subpar bread felt like a glaring oversight that detracted from what was otherwise an excellent meal.\nOverall, the restaurant delivers on flavor, technique, and ingredient quality, particularly in its cold and hot appetizer selection. However, for a French establishment, neglecting the bread selection is a misstep that should be addressed to elevate the dining experience to its full potential.",

      "text": "Although this was my 4th or 5th visit to Atout, it’s my first time leaving a review. One suggestion would be for the service staff to check with diners about any food allergies or dietary restrictions, as not all ingredients are listed on the menu. That aside, the food was excellent, and the service was impeccable. I regretted not tipping Francis—he was incredibly hospitable and even ran after us when we forgot our bag of leftovers.",

      "text": "This French bistro—honestly, it was just okay. A super casual renovation looking restaurant with a pricey side and not the easiest to get to if you don’t drive.\nThey do offer a set lunch, so maybe that’s when it gets packed!\n\nFood-wise, it was pretty average. The sourdough and mushroom soup didn’t stand out, and while the mains were decently portioned for the price, the taste ok-ok really didnt wow us—especially compared to other French spots in Singapore.\n\nService could definitely be better.\nThere were quite a few staff around, but only one Chinese gentleman actually smiled and made us feel welcome.\nThe rest looked either stressed or just not very friendly!\n\nOverall, not an expected experience, but probably not somewhere we’d rush back to.",
