      "text": "I had an amazing dining experience at Lino! The food was absolutely fantastic. The seafood pasta was perfectly cooked, with juicy prawns and scallops that were fresh and flavorful. The seasoning was spot on, and the pasta had just the right texture.\n\nThe steak with a sunny-side-up egg was another highlight—tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection. The sauce added a delicious depth of flavor, and the crispy fries and fresh greens complemented the dish wonderfully.\n\nThe ambiance was cozy and inviting, and the service was excellent. The staff was attentive and friendly, making the experience even better.\n\nHighly recommend Lino for anyone looking for great food and a lovely atmosphere. I’ll definitely be coming back!",

      "text": "Today, my friends and I visited Lino@Binjai for a Christmas and New Year gathering, and it turned out to be a fantastic choice! This was our first time at the restaurant, and we were impressed.\n\nThe food was exceptional. A standout recommendation is the Burrata Pizza—a must-try! It features a thin crust perfectly layered with fresh tomato paste and creamy burrata cheese. Absolutely delicious! Another highlight was the Iberian Pork, suggested by the attentive staff member ZQ, which was cooked to perfection. We also enjoyed the seafood spaghetti, which was rich in flavor and perfectly balanced. The chicken wings, garlic bread, and truffle fries were all excellent additions to our meal.\n\nA special shoutout to ZQ, whose excellent service made our meal even more enjoyable. This restaurant is definitely worth visiting. We’ll be back!",
