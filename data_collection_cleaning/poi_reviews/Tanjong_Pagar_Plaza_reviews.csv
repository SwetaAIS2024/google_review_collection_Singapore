Paul,4,"Simple & unpretentious open air shopping mall spread over at least two levels.  A variety of vendors including restaurants, grocers, clothing, furniture, liquor, beauty services & others.

Idia Shroud,4,"Not sheltered all the way to the plaza but it is an overall good place to eat and shop, there is seating areas on the first floor food and general stores.Sadly, the lift does not have much space to fit a wheelchair as it is quite tight and can not fit much people without being squeezy.

Pros:
Have space to sit.
There is a good amount of food stores(hawker stores, bakeries, bbt store like 2?).
General stores and supermarkets at the first floor so don't need to climb down the stairs with heavy bags.

Cons:
Not sheltered all the way from the mrt to the plaza so bring an umbrella when it is gonna rain.
Not attractive to stay for long or explore.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114785706135410727283/reviews
Xin Hao,4,"Situated nearer to the south area of Singapore in a middle of a very lively location in Tanjong Pagar, just beside Amara and Carlton and City Hotel. Many historic traditional shops are hosted here with rich backgrounds. You can get many things done in this area - grocery, flowers, bakeries, cafes, affordable meals, and retail. Feels like you are in the heartlands but its right smack within CBD. Carpark is a little dim and crammed but still decent. Very accessible via Tanjong Pagar MRT as well. Love the blend of modern and traditional culture!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101038177603319548234/reviews
