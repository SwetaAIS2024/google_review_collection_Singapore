      "text": "As it was the Chinese new year period, there was limited food choice available. We happen to be around Marine Terrace and chance upon this stall selling malay food. Apart from Nasi Lemak, they also sell other stuff like curry puffs and kuehs. They offers 3 different sets from SGD$4.50 onwards.\n\nI ordered the set A which consist of a slice of fried egg, cucumber and ikan bilis, sambal chili and the fried chicken wing. The rice was fragrant but mushy. chicken wing wasnt cleaned properly, there are still feather attached to the wings. The cucumber that was served to us already turned sour. The chicken wing was crispy but bland, no seasoning.\n\nOverall, a pretty bad plate of nasi lemak if you asked me. They still have the cheek to impose festive period surcharge for such bad food. Avoid at all cost.",
