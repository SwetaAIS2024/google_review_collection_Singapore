Wan Abdullah,1,"Assalamu'alaikum! ISLAM teaches me to sabar and be good to all mankind. I attended the Geylang Serai Event of MHMS today, 11/01/2025; 5pm. My wife has hand injuries and not able to sit by herself. I need to be at her side, in case she slip and fall. After sit down with my wife, we listened to short speech by the MC. The makcik group then starts their performance. We are seated at three persons seat, beside corridor. I was at left corner and my wife at centre, a recycle bag beside her. We did not do anything against ISLAM. My wife is my responsibility. This MC after giving speech, came right up to me and instructed me to move away. I do not understand his language. My wife explained to me. Before I decided what I want to do next, I saw his hard stares. It makes me wonder, do I have to apologise for no crime, acting holy and thrown my wife a side? My wife wore a arm sling. Didn't MC see it? Two mat rockers sit infront of us with their female partners. Why only finger pointing at me? Who is in the right? Who is in the wrong? Surely ALLAH will judge!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116131840800822936098/reviews

Nur Iman Rostam,5,"This mosque visitation is my most unique as it is officially my 69th, which means I have made the trip to visit all of Singapore's main mosques. There are exactly 72 mosques, but, except for Masjid Taha (Ahmadiyya sect), Masjid Burhani (Shi'a sect) and Masjid Pulau Bukom which is the only offshore mosque that is not open to the public because Pulau Bukom is an oil refinery site.

Masjid Haji Mohd Salleh is located in one of Singapore's Geylang districts which are as always known for vice activities from back in the days until now. However, based on my open perspective, Geylang deserves credit for being authentic, real and unchanged. It reminds me of how preservation worked so well with the old shophouses still intact even after years of innovation and constant renovation. This mosque has proven for as long as it has lived, its presence will never be changed even if the future of Singapore takes a different course.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110287485091231667131/reviews
Monirul Islam,5,"Alhamdulillah, I really enjoyed praying in this mosque.  The most beautiful thing is that the prayer sermons and prayer topics are shown live on the Internet and there is a big TV, and every topic is shown on the TV.  It is even better that specially donated food is given to the mosque after the prayer.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107974298339867917998/reviews
