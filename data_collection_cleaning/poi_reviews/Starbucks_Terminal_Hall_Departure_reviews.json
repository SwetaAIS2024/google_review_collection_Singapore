I got my favorite Java Chip Frappuccino and a slice of their Blueberry Cheesecake always a classic combo! My wife had the same, and as usual, I couldn’t resist picking up a new Starbucks mug. This time it was a lovely shade of green that instantly caught my eye. Super happy with the purchase and the chill moment we had before heading home.",

Asked about the breakfast deal and she rudely say that breakfast only start at 4am. Then she walk away, did not bother to ask me about other kind of orders. In the first place, banner is up to attract customer from far and the deal not valid due to timing, might as well take it down first? Then the lady (boyish haircut) could have a better customer service. If not ready to serve customer at wee hours, just off the lights. If deal not ready due to timing, just take down banner. Went down to level 2 (arrival) hall to enjoy coffee and some bread with good customer service instead. Shame on you starbucks.",
