But even for Singapore it’s below average..  and as I write this I asked when the pizza was coming, and the server just looked ABSOLUTELY CLUELESS..",

Even though the service was slow at least they are clear when they serve the drinks to you.\n\nWe had a blast,but there can be a lot of room for improvement :)",
