Abrial Wong,1,"I had such bad luck at the coffee store today—it really left me feeling frustrated.

I would like to share my experience as an elderly customer.

I am an old folk with limited knowledge of apps and digital systems. I had trouble downloading and using your app and despite spending over 20 minutes trying—with no proper assistance—it still wasn’t settled.

In the end, I gave up and didn’t buy the 7no milk tea. I came for. It was frustrating and discouraging.

I hope your store can consider having a cashier or alternative payment option for customers like me who are not comfortable with technology.

Thank you for your attention.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115836235603548162957/reviews
Skye Cai,4,"Fast servicing.
Good to have the app to order in advance so that can collect at the right time, to skip the queue of ordering.
Tried the dirty latte. A little sweetened. Coffee taste is not that strong, but it’s great with the milk.
The staff is short of manpower in the morning.
Pretty much self serving.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Ng Li Jie,5,"I have to hand it down to my friend and colleague of mine who introduced me to Luckin' Coffee.

While en route to Bowl Chap around the corner at Galaxis (literally a stone's throw away), I promptly signed in to their app and made my first online order: one iced coconut latte (least sweet).  First orders cost $0.99, or one dollar.

The drink did not disappoint, because it was a myriad of flavours rushing in my tongue.  Coffee beans, milk, coconut served cold was the greatest thing to experience in a hot day like today.

I expected a long waiting time for the latte, but it turned out to be 3 minutes of waiting!  So I decided to take the iced latte with me and have it alongside my delicious lunch at Bowl Chap.  I'll be sticking around for more promising deals and/or promos, and see what is the next best drink I am going to try out. :)",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100629166541387380318/reviews

Subbs Ram,2,Usually enjoy many of the coffee at luckin but at this outlet it was disappointing. Bought the ice orange coffee. Was told ice machine broke down. That’s ok. But received orange flavored milk instead of coffee.  Hoping such mistakes can be avoided next time.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104046188238451594059/reviews
