The portions were generous. And the food, while not spectacular, was tasty enough.\n\nThey used to sell their noodles at $3 (small), $4 (medium), $5 (large), which was really good value. But I guess inflation got to them too. So, prices are now $4/$5/$6.\n\nStill, I would say the stall owners don't scrimp on what they offer. You can see how much extra veggies they gave me on top of my dumpling soup.\n\nWill come again when I'm in the area and feel like wantan or chicken feet noodles.",
