      "text": "First time visiting SBCC Bishan yesterday and I must say it was such a great experience with Dr Adeline Wong and staff!\n\nApart from the long waiting time, which I understand can‚Äôt really be avoided, the staff were really nice and attentive. Dr Adeline Wong is really cheerful and pleasant to speak with too! She did made my husband and I feel like we‚Äôre speaking to a friend that was advising and encouraging me in my breastfeeding journey, not just talking about the issues our baby was facing.\n\nWhat was really good was how she took the time to listen and explain too. It was not rushed at all- so i understand the long waiting time but i think it‚Äôs really worth it because we felt heard, seen and definitely left feeling encouraged despite it being a pediatric appointment for our infant.\n\nThank you Dr Wong & team! üôèüèº",

Attitude was definitely less than stellar... Perhaps we got her on a wrong day when she's not in a gd mood and her fees are expensive... Should have listened to my sister n visit the other clinic nearby instead. Unprofessional. First & Last visit. Period",
