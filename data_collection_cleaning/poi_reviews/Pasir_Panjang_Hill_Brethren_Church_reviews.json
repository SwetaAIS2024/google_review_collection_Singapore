I was removed from a woman to woman group without prior notification even when my church membership is still in place.  More can be done to make especially newcomers feel accepted and welcome, rather than self serving and ticking off service boxes.  I pray for the Holy Spirit to revive this church, also all other bodies of the Christ in the same plight.",

And I found the staff is so considerate and warm. Makes me feel so loved and cared for. Okay! No wonder I believe that's the case in all the churches",
