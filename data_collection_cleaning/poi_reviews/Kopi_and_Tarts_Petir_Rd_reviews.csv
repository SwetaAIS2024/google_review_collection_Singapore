LessTrodden Path,2,"It's very unfortunate ‚òπÔ∏è

Ordered my favourite ice kopi n tart set. Almost every where has been crusty lovely pastry with substantially strong delicious XXL sized ice coffee.

This time, the coffee was great as usual, but the tart was dry and no longer crusty, and the base was limp soft.

I brought the plate of tart to the lady behind the counter and she held the plate and said it all like that, and shrugged her shoulders.

I have never had that indifferent response from any staff of Kopi & Tarts before. And the Tarts ... product of the shop's namesake, didn't live up to itself.

Disappointed. ‚òπÔ∏è",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103872993290928102696/reviews
J,3,"The tarts and puffs looks super good. Prices are a little higher than average too but decided to give it a try.

Ordered a few puffs and tarts. The puffs aren‚Äôt their strong suit. But their tarts are nice.

Staff are friendly as well. Would love to give 5 stars but unfortunately the price point did not meet the quality of food.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113966954151240288230/reviews
