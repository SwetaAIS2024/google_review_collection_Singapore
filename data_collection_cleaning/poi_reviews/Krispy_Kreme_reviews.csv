Cindy Koh,1,"Came at 7.50pm on a Friday night but only 1 donut left. Not sure if the opening hours on google (till 9.30pm) is correct?
Happens quite often on weekend nights too",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115380777968168785269/reviews
Florence Leow,5,"üü® Krispy Kreme
üü¶1 Harbour Front Walk, B2-K26
VivoCity mall, Singapore 098585

üü† On 9th May 2025 Fri evening, I had visited the Krispy Kreme outlet here at Vivocity and picked up a couple of their famous Original Glazed doughnuts.

üü® The decor of the donut kiosk was modern and sleek, fitting well with the overall aesthetic of Vivocity Mall.

üü® The service was pleasant, with this cashier staff being particularly friendly, smiley and helpful. ‚¨õÔ∏è She also allowed me to take photos of the kiosk.  üî∑Ô∏è Thank you for the kind hospitality.

üü§  The real stars of the show, however, were the doughnuts. ‚û°Ô∏èThe Original Glazed ones were as always, absolutely delicious - soft, fluffy, and perfectly sweet. It is no wonder they are a favourite among doughnut lovers.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
K K,1,"Was told off rudely by Filipino cashier when I enquired if they were open (10:59am but opening hours was 11am). ""Not opened yet! And I need to display these first before I can open cos today there is a promotion!"" Then the next min, she promptly sells donuts to a customer who spoke Tagalog.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106683449038942788084/reviews
