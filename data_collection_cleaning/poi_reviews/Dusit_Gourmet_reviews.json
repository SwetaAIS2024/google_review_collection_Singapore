      "text": "Was introduced to this place by a friend. Was pleasantly surprised - great ambience and truly a hidden gem. Good service and big array of food. Understandably whilst they don’t display loads of food out, they’ll happily replenish or provide when you ask as there’s always a staff behind each international food section. Also, with so much food wastage going on - I think it’s a more responsible way of serving. Staff are super efficient (clearing used plates), refilling water and friendly. The dessert selection is huge; tea too. Admittedly we did not succeed to try everything as we were too full to do so.",

Also sells some drinks for takeaway. The shop is quite small so not a large selection, but still a few items if needed. Located next to the Greenhouse restaurant.",
