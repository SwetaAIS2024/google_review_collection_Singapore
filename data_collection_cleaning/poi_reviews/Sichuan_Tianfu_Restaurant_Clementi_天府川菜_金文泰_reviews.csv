Yoong,4,"Food is not bad but the service is a bit slow. We booked a large group table but were squeezed in a small room with another very large group so it was quite loud and kind of hard to converse. Still, the food was nice, especially the twice cooked pork, crispy pork and mapo tofu.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101979221122826870413/reviews

Devy Pribadi,4,"Had a group lunch here on weekdays. We ordered Godmother Chicken, Tianfu Twice Cooked Pork, Dry Fried Long Beans, Scrambled Egg with Green Chilli Peppers, Sichuan Fish with Pickled Mustard Greens and Vermicelli, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Yangzhou Fried Rice.
Food were nice and tasty, except the pork belly has a bit of gamey taste, so was a bit unpleasant when we eat it. Otherwise the rest were okay.
Portion was a bit small, so it’s kinda pricey.
The restaurant is not too big but the environment is okay. Service was okay too.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827903087596800354/reviews

Hot, spicy and bold flavors. Food is totally delicious and portions are generous for the price.

Stephanie Foo,5,"This is my second time dining at this restaurant, and once again, it was a truly lovely experience.

The food was not just tasty, it was thoughtfully recommended based on what we personally enjoy. The person in charge actually took the time to chat with us, understand our preferences, and suggested dishes that turned out to be perfect for our taste buds. What really sets this place apart, though, is the service. It honestly feels more genuine and attentive than many of the bigger, more established restaurants. Our teapot was always refilled without us needing to ask and this small simple gesture can show how much they care.

The warm friendly smiles from the staff just made everything feel even more welcoming. It’s rare to find a place where the people and the food all come together so naturally. Will definitely be back again and will also recommend this spot to anyone who appreciates good food and truly heartfelt service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116184192347100128460/reviews
