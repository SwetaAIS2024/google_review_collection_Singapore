Pae S,2,"ordered chicken salad and mushroom soup at 1205. waited 20 mins for my food, even though it was a Saturday and barely anyone, there was no orders before me that were in queue.

Elliott Wong,5,"Staff is friendly. Portions are generous. Food in not the best in all of NTU but still great. Dining hall is tranquil and cool, making it one of the best dining experiences in the whole campus. There is also the option for bottomless drinks, either hot or cold.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111889512242080299781/reviews
Yu Qing,4,"New, so the place is really clean and air conditioned and generally has good vibes. A very nice place to study/work in as there’s not much crowd also.

Menu is kinda limited and abit more expensive than your usual canteen but still under $10 for mains. Free flow soft/hot drinks for $2.5 if ala carte or $1.8 if you get it with a main.

Food is a hit or miss - sometimes it’s really good (the fish and chips, nasi lemak), sometimes it’s kinda eh (the pasta, mainly). Not bad though! Would consider this as one of my lunch or dinner options, especially if I need to do work.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114372851653356230879/reviews
