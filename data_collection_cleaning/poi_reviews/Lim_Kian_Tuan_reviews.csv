Athena M,5,"So thankful we chanced upon this nice plant farm that seems to specialise in orchids, just what we were looking for! The orchids were so beautiful, and the nicest we saw out of the different farms we visited today. We really liked that we got to customise the orchid arrangement and that it was potted on the spot. Mr Lim was so helpful and guided us through what would be the best floral arrangement, taking into consideration where the orchids were going to be put, the other things in the room, what we liked, and etc. He also gave us some mosquito repellant when we got bitten. Haha. Really A+++ customer service! Take note that they don’t have a sign outside, it just says Lot No. 119, but you should just be brave and go in! It’s so worth it.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103232186648182903163/reviews
