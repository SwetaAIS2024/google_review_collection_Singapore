      "text": "New roasted delights at this coffeeshop. Try try.\n\nOrdered a chicken curry mee, 3 combination platter for 1 and plate of dry mee.\nThey served a good chicken curry mee at $5 albeit slightly oily as you can see from picture. The white chicken served in curry mee was really good and tender.\nAll 3 roasted meats in the platter was good. Char siew had that slight char which I prefer in my char siews. The sweet caramelisation is there as well. Sauce complimented it.\nRoast duck is a herbal one which when bitten into, you can totally taste the herbal flavours. Duck meat was tender as well.\nRoast pork was chopped in bigger than average pieces. There was a good ratio of fats and meat. Skin was crispy good. Will order the roast pork again on my next visit.\n\nThe separate noodles had a nice sauce but felt that it was slightly dry. Maybe can ask for more sauce next time.\n\nOverall good stall, will eat again.\n\n3 star for service because I get the feeling the guy whom took my order dint felt like serving at all.",

Duck meat is tender. roast pork is crispy without porky taste. Pardon the presentation cos I messed it up before taking photos.  Will come again when I crave for roasted meat.",
