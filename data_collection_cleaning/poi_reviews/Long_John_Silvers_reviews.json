If you like mushy bread on mushy fish with mushy vegetables. The fries are good though.\n\nAC is almost non-existent . It is not even crowded. There's only 2 of us customers in the shop. Is that why they do not bother to turn on the AC?",

When we returned the food, the replacement was sent to our table in less than 5minutes time and they simply mixed in some hot fries and the fish was still as dry.\n\nAir-con wasn’t working, and Coke weren’t gassy. I am never going to dine there anymore.",
