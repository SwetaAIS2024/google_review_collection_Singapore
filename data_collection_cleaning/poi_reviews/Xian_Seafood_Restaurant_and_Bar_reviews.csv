Randy Tan,3,The place is in a industrial area which is quite far off from public transport. Located at a building name TAG A. The service was good and pricing reasonable. Our food cost $88.50. Bring cash as they accept nets and cash payment only. The fish was fresh and tasty. The vegetable was a bit salty due to the oyster sauce. The salted egg squid was ordinary. The herbal prawn soup was nice though and prawn was tasty.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112959390777372665610/reviews

Darrell T,3,"Mee Goreng was edible, fish and prawn was acceptable level of freshness for $6 dish but overall dish was very oily.
Staff not motivated, customers are a chore to them even at 1150hrs.
Has potential but need more care from management.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114058421345042006839/reviews
