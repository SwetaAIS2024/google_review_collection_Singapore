Reiko H,5,"Escapade to a quiet park near CBD and gained inspiration from the nature. A park where you can immerse in to filter out the day to day noises and chaos from work. Occasionally you can even witness unique species or breed of birds resting on the trees. Take a look below and here‚Äôs what I captured on the trunk of this ages long tree. Breezy afternoon with Yellow-tailed Oriole resting peacefully and allowing me to appreciate its beauty. Take a stroll when you happened to pass by this area and be awed by the serenity of this park. Live once, lively peacefully & beautifully!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116368562396787087469/reviews
