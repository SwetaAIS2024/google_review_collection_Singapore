Aamir Butt,1,"Checked out today after an 8-night stay, and unfortunately, the experience was far from satisfactory. For the high apartment rates, the value simply isn’t there. Unlike a good four-star hotel that offers a well-rounded experience, including breakfast, here you get none of that—just an overpriced stay with no added perks.

Amenities are practically non-existent, except for a pool. There’s absolutely nothing for kids, making it a dull and frustrating experience for families. With no lobby, the only option for spending time together is the living area of the apartment, which feels restrictive and isolating.

For the price they charge, I expected much better facilities and service. Would not recommend for families looking for a comfortable and engaging stay.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117105280616345564437/reviews
Karoliina Korhonen,4,"I would give 4,5 stars if I could. I spent a week here in November. The staff was very friendly and the room was great. Excellent location too. The breakfast was good enough. The pool was out of use most of the time due to renovations. Of course, sometimes the property needs maintenance, it is understandable. What I really liked was that cleaning took place 4 (or 3? cannot remember) times a week. This made the space feel more like my own.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104928684782509293954/reviews
Sam W,5,Fantastic apartment which was very clean and a surprisingly large space for the amazing location! Only a 5 min walk to two MRT subway stations which can get you anywhere in the city in not too much time. Vani and all of the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating! Breakfast was nice (mostly continental) and the rooftop pool was very pretty and relaxing. Would definitely recommend staying here for anyone visiting Singapore and needing a good base for exploring.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117543967880196480826/reviews
Matyas Szakos,5,"We had a wonderful stay at Adina. The service it provides is quite unique as it can be positioned somewhere between a hotel and an apartment rental.
The apartment was well furnished with fully equipped kitchen, dinnerware and washing machine and drier combined. The swimming pool is perfect for relaxing.
The location is close to Orchard road and malls but far away enough to be quiet and walking distance to multiple MRT and bus stations.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116822796613884098462/reviews
Phing Choo,5,"I had a great experience at this place and definitely will return again.
The staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially Vina!
