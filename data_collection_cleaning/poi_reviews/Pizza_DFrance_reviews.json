      "text": "Read some good reviews so decided to order the pizzas(Double happiness set) for self pickup. However on reaching home, was disappointed to find both the pizzas we were given weren't the ones we ordered. Instead of the Super Meaty and BBQ chicken which we have ordered, we were given seafood Fantasy and sunshine Fantasy. The seafood pizza tasted ok but the Sunshine Fantasy had sliced hard boiled eggs in it and I really hated it, I think it tasted weird. My family didn't really like the boiled eggs in the pizza as well.\n\nOn top of that, we ordered fried chicken wings, and 4 out of the 5 wings were undercooked, the flesh was still pink  within and a couple of them, especially the bigger pieces were still bloody.\n\nFortunately, there was a chicken lasagna which I ordered and that I could eat. Even then it tasted just average and nothing special.\n\nI hope the kitchen could get all the orders correct before they hand it over to the customers, otherwise it is very troublesome to bring both pizzas back to change for the right ones. I do not encourage the restaurant to let customers open and check the pizzas and to have them put back if it weren't theirs for it will be too unhygienic. Doing it right the first time should be the way to go.",
