Samham Tam,4,"A convenient place to dine/chill at if youâ€™re at the National library. Was here on a Sunday afternoon and the place offers plenty of seats and space for kids to walk/run around. Great view of bugis and intercontinental!

I ordered white coffee, mocha, teriyaki chicken bowls for the adults and lasagnas for the kids. The coffee is decent and though the food portions are a tad small for the price and seems to have been pre-made and heated up prior to serving.

I would recommend this as a place to chill, read a book, have coffee with the family.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102149038595831645948/reviews

Hayden,5,"Had the sirloin steak burrito bowl and mango salmon on the last day before Phase 2 kicks back in, have to say that we definitely made the right choice! Great ambience, food was amazing and seriously affordable (at $28 nett for 2 pax), staff were also friendly and accommodating, not to mention that we were given complimentary desserts at the end of our meal by a cool guy (didn't catch his name unfortunately!) Awesome experience, we'll surely be back soon :)",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118096675916700491638/reviews
Anikaz Travel,2,"Not a good cafe!!!! Donâ€™t recommend to anyone.
I came here with a friend and ordered some coffee. Specifically it was mint hot chocolate,mocha and iced caramel white coffee. First of the server was confused when I asked for mint chocolate and charged me for mint mocha instead. Luckily they refunded our money. This is alright and I didnâ€™t really feel like it was bad as we all make mistakes. However, we asked for our mint chocolate and mocha hot but it was barely lukewarm. We had to ask them to reheat it again.
Overall, this place isnâ€™t really worth the price you are paying as it is barely good.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100371975357068365869/reviews
