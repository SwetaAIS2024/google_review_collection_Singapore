xaxxolonch,4,"Their food was super good , just the miso wasnâ€™t hot enough and miso paste not thick enough, specialised salad sauce made with mango, love their chicken recipe, they allow to let me change beef to chicken. Their fried chicken was fried till crisp super delicious. Their nanban tartar sauce was homemade too. Their miso chicken was a disappoint tho, they use packed miso sauce to fake miso. Love their chawanmusshi , generous ingredients served hot and the texture was silky and soft enough.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112943480526851653374/reviews
Steve,5,"Food and service is top notch. Ramen is great. The beef is not slices but in chunks as per pic.

Unagi fried rice - Unagi portion is pretty small.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115304262535442778991/reviews
Pei Fen Goh,3,"Visited on a Friday night, located inside Horizon Hill golf club ( beside swimming pool)
Overall food on moderate, nothing surprise me. Yakitori chicken wing got a strong chick taste which it difficult to swallow.
Price wise a bit over price, might due to location. Honestly you can get similar or better in some other place.
This meal cost us around RM300+ for 2 pax..",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116315477343461760212/reviews
Tan Joseph,3,"Away from the hustle and bustle.
Food wise is pretty decent and price is fair.
General ambience at the main dinning area is more family style but they do have 3 privacy booths and 2 private rooms.
Was a little disappointed with the sake and sochu menu though, maybe there's no demands.
Service wise, the staffs are polite but lacking in attentiveness and knowledge.
Was a little disappointed that they closes at 9.30pm, again, it could be due to the location.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115210529894917000020/reviews
Leng,4,Ordered a Tori Katsu Misoyaki and half a pint of beer. Very big portion of katsu. Highly worth it for RM30. Serene environment for those who prefer a quieter environment for weekday lunch.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106776134369395162533/reviews
