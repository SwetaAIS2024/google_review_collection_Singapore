Vanessa Ng,4,"Dog-friendly with lots of supplies for dogs - water bowls, wash up area, even free treats - our doggy appreciated it. Plenty of outdoor tables to sit at.

Christine Lee,5,"This is a gem in a HDB neighbourhood. You get great coffee and food with excellent service from the owners, Daniel and Cheryl. I really like their mission in their business which is to do good and to help others. They have employed those marginalized in our society. They have also provided a corner where you can donate books as well as borrow a book home to read. It’s pet friendly too.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117063691860800114256/reviews
