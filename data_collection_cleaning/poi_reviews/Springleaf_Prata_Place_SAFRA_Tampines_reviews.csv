Darren,3,"Came by for a post-workout dinner, and luckily they were still accepting orders at 9.30pm. Between the three of us, we got the Maggi Goreng Set ($9.20) - which came with maggi goreng (added chicken for $1.70), Mini Masala Chicken, and Teh Tarik (+50cents for iced) - and Butter Chicken ($7.70) with three plain prata ($1.40 each).

First off, the maggi goreng lacked flavour except saltiness. The chicken that we added was just unevenly sized chunks of dry chicken breast. And while the masala chicken was alright, we were puzzling over the butter chicken for awhile as it tasted not at all creamy and nothing like the butter chicken we were familiar with. Very strange. The crispy pratas were the only saving grace of the meal.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews
Ian Li,3,"This is a typical chain storeâ€”affordable, and the food quality matches the price. However, the taste is just average.

Some dishes had exciting names, like salted egg prawn prata and egg mozzarella prata, which sounded promising but ended up being underwhelming or even a bit disappointing. Instead of using real salted egg yolk, they just used salted egg sauce, and the mozzarella portion was too small and lacked flavor.

That said, this place isnâ€™t trying to be a high-end Indian restaurant, so for a regular chain eatery, itâ€™s still acceptable.

One major downside was the waiting staffâ€™s poor communication skillsâ€”most of the time, we struggled to understand what they were saying, which made ordering difficult. This is definitely something they need to improve.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103602047879226708518/reviews
Jia Jun Chua,1,"Food is pretty good, bad service provided, when ordering food, the staff there did not advise on the appropriate amount of food which resulted in over ordering, very unprofessional service exhibited by the staff. First photo of the staff who served at the cashier is provided below. The staff did not exhibit his professionalism to inform the size of the murtabak. The second photo below is a medium-sized murtabak. Not advisable to visit the place.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104967373861373233026/reviews
Pei,5,"We arrived around 9AM on Sunday. The queue was still acceptable. But when we finished our breakfast at 10AM, there was super long queue at the counter till the entrance.

We ordered plain prata, egg prata, cheese prata and Umami 50. I didn't expect such a generous portion of mozzarella cheese in my cheese prata; it was incredibly good.

The Umami 50 was also good, with ample fillings of chicken luncheon meat, chicken floss, and mozzarella cheese.

They provided two self-service curry options: chicken and fish curry.

Overall, it was a good meal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107008951870777106419/reviews
