      "text": "We came here to celebrate my colleague‚Äôs birthday, and it was such a delightful experience. This is my second visit, and once again, the place did not disappoint. The ambiance is warm and inviting, making it perfect for both casual gatherings and special occasions.\n\nThe food was not only decent but genuinely enjoyable, with a good variety of options to choose from. One standout was the drink we ordered called ‚ÄúRecharge‚Äù ‚Äì it was absolutely amazing, with a refreshing flavor that left a lasting impression. I wish I had remembered to take a photo to share!\n\nOverall, the combination of great food, an excellent drink selection, and a cozy atmosphere makes this spot a reliable choice for celebrations or simply unwinding with friends. Looking forward to coming back again!",

Had the aglio olio from Plank, i think it combined with baker & cook in the same area so you could order food and drinks from both sides.\n\nAglio olio was pretty okay, many spices but not exactly as clean tasting as i liked my aglio olio to be. Tap water is provided for free as well. Overall not a bad experience.",

Its a mix of rocket, pumpkin seed, pumpkin, olive oil and it taste great.\n\nI am normally thin crust lover but the sourdough pizza here is great. Its alittle messy to eat though. The toppings slide around alot.\n\nService wise is really good. The staff helped me out when i asked to take away. They gave me all the remaining pumpkin salad when i ask to take away. They help me packed my remaining pizza slices when asked.\n\nOverall i enjoy my experience",
