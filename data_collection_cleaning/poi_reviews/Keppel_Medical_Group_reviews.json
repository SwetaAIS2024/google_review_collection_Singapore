Will change my go-to clinic to Keppel Medical from now on.",

      "text": "Highly impressed with the high standard of care and service par excellence of this clinic.  Just visited the clinic for a routine blood test but ended with a thorough review of overall heath status and a recurring sinus problem.  Dr. Soh is a caring doc who will always take time to give a thorough explanation of my condition as well as offer suggestions for self-care.  His staff members are also highly efficient, helpful and caring.  I have witnessed them going beyond their call of duties to reach out to the elderly and other vulnerable patients.  I may add that their charges are very reasonable.  Keep it up and all the best!",

The receptionist said \" it's a long wait\" puts my name down, gives me a sticker with number 38 on it and says \"come back around 12pm\".\n\nI get in at 1155am. 5 patients go in front of me... 40,41, 42..  I keep asking the receptionist, who blatantly let's these other patients go ahead, \"excuse me why is everyone going ahead of me when I registered so much earlier? \".\n\nShe said \"the next one, I told the doctor already \". *beep* number 45 goes in.\n\nWhat on earth? How disrespectful of their patients time. Terribly disorganised.\n\nApparently it wasn't the resident doctor and her team on duty that day. Still it wasn't a good experience.",
