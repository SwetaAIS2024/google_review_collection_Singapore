V Lim,2,"Not an impressive place and not befitting of 4 stars. I would have let it go if it was a 2- or 3-star serviced apartment. I had to turn a blind eye to many areas during my couple of months stay there.

Reception counter: nice and long table but never manned. What’s the point of having a reception table? I’ve gone in and out of the apartment daily and did not see anyone there.

Car park: good that it’s free, but there were only 5 parking spaces with no gantry or gate to deter members of public from parking. Worse, of the pathetic 5 spaces, there were several occasions that staff’s car and maintenance vehicles took up 3 of them, leaving only 2 spaces for residents. What’s the logic here?

Cleanliness, hygiene and facilities: rooms were okay; happy with the housekeeping standards. But the common areas were quite bad. Just look at the pictures: stained water dispenser taps, many fallen leaves on the floor, stained blinds, rusty fans, rusty kettle (I didn’t dare to use it), etc.

There were only 2 pathetically old washing machines and 1 was down. Residents had to vie for the use of 1 washing machine? Of the 4 dryers there, 2 were perpetually down and never repaired. Many times, the housekeepers also used the remaining 2 dryers to dry their linens. So, what were residents expected to do? I stayed for a couple of months and there was no intention by the management to repair them.

I also spotted bugs crawling out from the parquet floor in my room. I cringed looking at them.

TV: it’s basically a white elephant. Not quite working. I didn’t even get to enjoy the free-to-air channels. When I asked, I was told the management was aware of this and there wasn’t any intention to rectify the issue. In fact, I was told that I was “lucky” that I could watch 2 channels.

Shower: I had to shower as quickly as I could as I would lose the hot water midway. I caught a cold during my first week stay there because of the icy cold water that I had to deal with. This issue persisted every single day.

Ventilation: my neighbours cooked daily and the fragrance/ odour was palpable in my room. It was as if I cooked in my room.

Lack of soundproofing: lucky to get a room that faced the landed property. However, I could still hear the busy roads.

My basic needs were not met. I didn’t require this place to be impressive, but basic cleanliness, working amenities and certain SOPs should be in place. Won’t be back.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467262142197818447/reviews
Vlad I,5,"We stayed here for a few months. It is clean, quiet, well maintained, spacious, modern, with nice facilities and very kind staff. We bothered them with several requests during our stay and the staff was always exemplary, helpful, considerate, very kind, and understanding. Our circumstances were not easy, but they made our stay a great one. Highly recommended!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101834519202576838249/reviews

Evelyn Chan,1,"**A Nightmare of a Stay – Avoid at All Costs!**

I booked this place for two months while my home was undergoing renovations, and what my husband and I endured was nothing short of a nightmare—especially since we both work from home.

**Entrance:**
The lack of reception sets the tone immediately. There’s no receptionist and no air conditioning in the lobby—you’re left standing in the heat, ringing a bell. The parking situation is abysmal, with only four regular parking spots and one handicap space, all first-come, first-served. Arrive late, and you’ll find yourself out of luck. The building itself is poorly maintained, with mouldy blinds lining the corridors.

**Room:**
It’s hard to believe we stayed here for two months. From the day we checked in, it was clear this place was not cared for. The entire place has, “management couldn’t care less” written everywhere. There were stains on my pillow, wallpaper peeling off, and curtains that were torn and missing hooks. The so-called “executive one-bedroom apartment” was a joke. The couch was a small, slippery, uncomfortable PVC mess, and the lack of a proper sitting or dining area was frustrating—especially for an extended stay. We had to juggle our laptop and meals on a tiny roller table since there was no desk or chair. I think they assign the worst rooms to those staying longer term and focus maintenance on short term rooms?

The bedside lamps were blinding and ugly, the mirror was rusting with mysterious specks, and one of the bedside tables was dangerously tilted, threatening to spill anything placed on it. The dryer didn’t work, but thankfully there was a balcony where we could hang our clothes—just like everyone else in the building.

As for the bathroom, it was cramped and mouldy. At under five feet tall, even I couldn’t shower without bumping into the walls. To top it off, the plants on the balcony were dead, adding to the overall sense of neglect.

**Facilities:**
The pool? Don’t bother. I swam once, and that was enough—the water was murky. The resident lounge was dark, gloomy, and depressing, though at least it was windy. They also store all their spare things in what was maybe a canteen. The roof terrace was overrun with mosquitoes, and the decking was in dire need of repairs. The Wi-Fi was atrocious, constantly dropping and painfully slow, making working from home a real struggle.

To make matters worse, every evening around 6 p.m., a spotlight from the pool would shine directly into our room, lighting it up all night long. Though after several complaints, the staff apologized, blaming it on a “technical fault,” saying that they switched it off and it came back on again. I had to messaged them for 3 nights in a row just to remind them to turn it off.

**Service:**
The staff were all very young—likely Gen Z—and you’re expected to communicate entirely through WhatsApp so don’t expect a sense of empathy or urgency. Even checkout was done without any face-to-face interaction; you simply leave the card key in the room, take a picture of it, and go. This may sound convenient, but I suspect it’s because they don’t want to deal with dissatisfied customers.

After reading reviews prior to our stay, I thought people were exaggerating. Now, having lived through it, I can confirm everything was true. If you’re even slightly particular about cleanliness or basic comfort, run! After your feedback expect the same copy and paste responses from two years back. They simply don’t care. I’m surprised this place wasn’t shut down five years ago. Good luck.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107070572696145480322/reviews
Carol Sajangbati,3,"Location was great as it's very close to Novena MRT and Velocity mall. The check-in process went quite smoothly but the AC wasn't turned on so it gets quite stuffy while you wait for GrabCar/Taxi.

The size of the room was great though it was quite dusty in certain areas. The kitchenette was well-stocked with all the utensils as well as kitchen appliances (really appreciated the big fridge and microwave).

All in all, it was worth the 1-week stay. Would stay here again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116849807013001808382/reviews
