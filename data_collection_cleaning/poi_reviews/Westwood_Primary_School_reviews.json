I was at 7/11 and your students kept screaming and were being loud and they kept running inside , they almost knocked over a stand + bumping into people without apologising. Even another student seemed very disturbed by them. Everyone in their seemed very annoyed by them. What are you guys even teaching them?? They should know better than to act like that In public especially when they are wearing their school uniform.",
