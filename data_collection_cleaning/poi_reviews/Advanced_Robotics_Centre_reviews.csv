Kevin Shen,5,"I spent a summer working at the robotics lab, and I learned a lot of new material and got to contribute to an important project. I came into the lab knowing nothing about robotics, and after my time here, I learned to use a robot command/operating system, write code/programs, and build/control a remote-controlled car that follow people around on its own. The professors and coworkers are super friendly and knowledgeable, and the food at the National University is really cheap too. I would highly recommend interning here if you want to learn more about robotics, or are more experienced and want to tackle a bigger project. I guarantee that you will learn a lot.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111507518723467197213/reviews
