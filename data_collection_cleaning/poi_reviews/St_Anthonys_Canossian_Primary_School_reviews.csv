D J,5,"Fantastic school that my daughter has been attending for the last 3 years. Teachers are excellent and very caring. My daughter has made loads of friends and loves SACPS. For parents, there is WhatsApp groups and plenty of opportunity to volunteer at school events, though no pressure if you don‚Äôt want too. Got nothing but positive things to say about SACPS. Thanks so much!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115739619834063359688/reviews
