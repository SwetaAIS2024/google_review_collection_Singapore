Just because CW doesnâ€™t have competitors at this point, their service really sucks!!! No GRAB or Personal pick ups allowed into this point..the only and sole transportation is this bloody CW Yellow bus!!! Buses keeps on moving with no pick up on passenger who been waiting for more than half an hour..the drivers just ride off the bus EMPTY but the ppl waiting in LONG Q!!! I hope someone would start another bus company for this point!!! Which nvr would happen, disappointment!!",
