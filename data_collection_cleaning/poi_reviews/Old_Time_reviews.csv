TF,5,"Always walked past this old school snack shop on the way to IMM and smelled the fragrance of the herbal tea egg (Ëå∂Âè∂Ëõã). Finally succumb to my temptations and bought two back. Best decision ever. Just look at the color and marbled patterns of the egg and you can tell how well it has been soaked with the spices.

Also went for the chickpeas and they were amazing as well. Friendly auntie and her son running the stall. Saw them making tapioca cakes live at the stall as well. Happy to be adding a stall to my list so I know where I can go whenever I am craving for these old school pasar malam snacks!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101085736491369105980/reviews
June Tan,5,"Most delicious tapioca cake ever! They are handmade with the old school taste you will expect from back in the olden days. Made by the very friendly auntie who really knows what she is doing! The tea leaf eggs are also very fragrance and made with legit good quality ingredients. Some of the best we ever tasted too! Prices are also extremely reasonable! These price and quality is simply unmatched, we got more 5 tapioca cake at only $3 and 3 tea leaf eggs at only $2.50. Highly recommended for anyone who is in the area üòã",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105809635769640585165/reviews
Hester F,1,"I have been getting shark fin‚Äôs soup every morning on the way to work and today while eating it, I tasted something funny and unchewable. I spit it out and it was a USED CIGARETTE BUD/FILTER. I have never been so disgusted in my life and the taste of the cigarette bud stayed in my mouth. I can‚Äôt imagine the whole shark fin contaminated with someone else‚Äôs saliva and germs plus ash or whatever contents from the used cigarette. Really shocking, especially from an outlet in the hospital.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117252387771560903926/reviews
