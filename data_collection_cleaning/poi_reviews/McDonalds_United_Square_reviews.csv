Kateryna Karpiuk,1,"UPD: They sent me the whole new order and everything was fresh, delicious and correct!
Cheating! Beware of Order Issues! Double-Check Before You Leave!
I ordered chicken wings and a triple cheeseburger (as shown in the attached photo), but I received chicken nuggets and a chicken burger instead. My Prosperity beef burger isnâ€™t not double as you can also see on that photo! Not only was my order completely wrong, but the items I got are also cheaper than what I paid for. This is unacceptable. I do NOT recommend this place! I hope that management will take serious actions because it seems like it happened not only with me! The whole order isnâ€™t correct!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116572666485301089772/reviews

Terrick W.,4,Reasonable service and food standard but it is super crowded even around 9am on a Saturday morning. Be prepared to wait for tables. Environment too busy for my likely.

Vlad I,1,Messed up our order and we only found out when we got home with our take away. Instead of my triple cheeseburger we got a terrible mcchicken. Careless and ignorant staff. See the photos.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101834519202576838249/reviews
