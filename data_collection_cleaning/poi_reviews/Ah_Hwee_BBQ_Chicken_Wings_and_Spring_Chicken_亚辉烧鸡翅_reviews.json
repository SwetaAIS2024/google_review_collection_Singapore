      "text": "Had the wings as some of the food blogs had recommended it from this stall, and it can be hard to differentiate the decent from the great at the Lagoon. I immediately noted that the price had increased to $1.40 per piece, pricier than some others. The wings were decent, but not something I would rave about. I would even find them a tad tough and dry, and they could definitely be juicier.",
