      "text": "I almost don't wanna post this because I low-key want to gatekeep this place... but credit where it's due; Best Employee Fried Chicken seriously lives up to its name. We had a small hiccup with our order â€” they ran out of chicken breast and there was a mix-up. But what truly impressed me was how they handled it. Instead of brushing it off, they sincerely apologized and offered us complimentary hash bites to make up for it. And let me tell you, those hash bites? Crispy, golden, and oddly addictive â€” not just a nice gesture, but a genuinely tasty one too.You donâ€™t always get that kind of care in fast-casual spots, but here, they made us feel seen and appreciated. Â That kind of effort is rare, and it says a lot about the heart behind this place. Deliciously well seasoned chicken, creamy avocado slices, perfectly boiled eggs â€” simple but done right. There's an authenticity to what they serve and how they serve it. No frills, just good food and great people. Itâ€™s easy to overlook gems like this, but they deserve way more love. Justâ€¦ donâ€™t all come at once. Let me have this spot a little longer, yeah?",

      "text": "Fried chicken is very yummy - the colour of chicken breast looks more appealing but both are nice! Chicken thigh is more moist! Itâ€™s interesting that the sides are all the healthier options ðŸ˜‚ we would prefer to have the unhealthy ones though (I.e. fries/onion rings/wedges). I think Cajun fries will go very well with the fried chicken. Location wise, itâ€™s very secluded in a corner and we wouldnâ€™t have seen this place if we didnâ€™t Google it. There was only 1 other customer when we were there on a weekday afternoon. Hopefully business will get better!!",

Portions are generous and super filling too, and for the price, itâ€™s great valueâ€”especially in the CBD area.",

It was quiet when we went so seating outside was easy. We also got the fried tofu, which again was delicious as it didnâ€™t taste slimy or oily. The staff are friendly and served with a smile.",
