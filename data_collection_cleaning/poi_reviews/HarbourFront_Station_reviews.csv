Sunny Simantov,5,"The better way to get into Sentosa island, with great views of the island and the city.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112277157820165191857/reviews
Ashiq Uk,1,"As a tourist visiting Singapore, I was excited to experience the Sentosa Cable Cars. Unfortunately, my visit to the ticket counter was met with one of the worst customer service experiences I've had in years.

The staff member at the counter, whose name tag read Amira, was extremely rude, unprofessional, and lacked basic courtesy. Her approach was dismissive and unfriendly, which is not something you'd expect in a world-class tourist destination like Singapore.

Having worked in customer service for years, I was truly shocked by the way I was treated. A place that attracts millions of tourists should ensure that frontline staff are trained to handle visitors with respect and kindness.

I also noticed similar reviews about this particular staff member, which suggests this is not an isolated incident. I hope the management takes serious note of this issue and implements appropriate action or retraining to prevent future visitors from facing the same disappointment.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112884973860326158100/reviews

Roy Rencs,4,"Had an amazing experience taking the cable car to and from Sentosa. During the day, the view was spectacular.

Jerry Wong,4,"Nice gondola ride on the way to Sentosa. Nice views of the treetops and nearby landmarks. It can get a bit stuffy and hot during the ride, so Iâ€™d recommend bringing a fan for those who are sensitive.. but you are in Singapore after all!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105769587656820428152/reviews
