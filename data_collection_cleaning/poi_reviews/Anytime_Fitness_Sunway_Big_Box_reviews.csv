Sebrina,5,"I joined Anytime Fitness a couple of months ago to pursue a healthier lifestyle, and despite having a gym in my apartment, I chose to continue my fitness journey here because of the amazing atmosphere. Coach Naufal has been amazing in making my workouts more effective and enjoyable, which is why I decided to sign up for personal training sessions with him. On weeks when work gets hectic and I go MIA, he checks in and keeps me accountable, helping me stay on track with my fitness goals. He also ensure that we do deep stretches before each session to avoid any injuries. He pays attention to each client and I highly recommend him!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103286310003979765007/reviews
Sakinah Halig,5,"I personally hate going to gym or exercise but the idea of me unable to walk at my 80s later on is tougher. So I decide to join anytime fitness for its classes and compare to other AF, Sunway bigbox & Aeon Bukit Indah has more classes and even weekend (Bkt Indah) (hope they will remain the classes on weekends since we (read: me) are working fulltime). You can join AF and go to any AF you want to.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103200404003272411593/reviews
Shahrin Suhaili,5,"Had a great session with Coach Azry!! He always push me to the limit in order to get the best out of me. He always motivate me and say “YOU CAN DO IT!” when I feel “I CAN’T DO THIS” . Apart from that, he also give me advise about a proper meal plan and a proper workout plan with the correct form. I felt different whenever I workout alone and workout with him!! Absolutely friendly and knowledgable!! I wish him the best for his journey as a PT and his competition next year.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114926671161616654763/reviews
Kimberley Howarth,4,"Really nice and well maintained gym. There is a large selection of machines, free weights, and cardio equipment. They also have a large studio. The biggest studio of all the branches so far, I believe. And they have a good selection of classes. I appreciate that the trainers/staff also leave you alone and let you do your own thing... and not follow you around trying to make conversation or try to talk or bully you into buying a package. I like that a lot. Even the person who attended to me when I came to enquire for membership (Yusri) was very relaxed and chill, and did not try to hard sell me or give me an hour long sales talk like so many other commercial fitness centres do. Thats was the main reason why I decided to sign up here. Only thing is the music is way too loud... I have trouble listening to my own music and surely it cant be good for your hearing to have the music turned up so loud. It's supposed to be a gym right, not a nightclub. The toilets and showers are pleasant and clean. One of the shower lights is not working. And the step to the washrooms are also quite a fall hazard. Why the step was built like this, who knows!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957590885643931784/reviews
