      "text": "The food was mediocre overall. I ordered the medium spicy fragrance but found it lacked any spice. The fish was overcooked, and the soup was undrinkable. While the portion sizes for add-on items were generous, the shredded potato was average, and the sliced pork with cucumber lacked flavor and impact.\n\nThe spinach was the only dish that stood out as decent. On a positive note, I enjoyed the jumbo lemon with plum drink—it came in a big cup, and the sweetness was perfectly balanced.\n\nOverall, the experience was underwhelming, and I wouldn’t return.",

We also added some side dishes to go with our dinner. Overall we enjoyed our dinner here, and not forgotten to mention that their services were excellent too.",

Coffee pork ribs and Chinese Spinach with Salted Eggs & Century Eggs both also delicious. Made us want to have more rice. Beverages also highly recommended for their Ice Lemon Water & Jumbo Handmade Pineapple Lemon Tea. Friendly staff and good ambience to have dinner here. Will come back again.",
