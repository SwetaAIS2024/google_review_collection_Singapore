      "text": "On November 27, 2005, West Coast Place Playground was opened to the public by the then Member of Parliament for Ayer Rajah SMC, Dr. Tan Cheng Bock as part of the upgrading project for the residents of West Coast Gardens. There is a plague that commemorates that auspicious eventful day as one sits in a sheltered gazebo with two large-size white-picket picnic tables. There is an open-air gymnasium to workout in the open space under hot sun and a huge playground for the kids to enjoy a great play date with friends and families.",

Parallel to the park, weeks ago on 26.4.22, it was total darkness also at the Drive road as ALL the lights lining both sides of this road blacked out from the junction with the main road right through the whole length of Drive. So dark it was that a sense of danger popped up as one walked through to the destination at the other end. ðŸ˜©\n\nIt's now been beautifully decorated ahead of National Day.",

Some areas of the rubber floor is wearing off, spewing shreds of flakes around - which is quite a hazardous condition for the children.\nNot the best lighting post sunset, which also needs sprucing up for safety of park goers.\nThere are child care centres close to this park, so an upgrade could really benefit the community.",
