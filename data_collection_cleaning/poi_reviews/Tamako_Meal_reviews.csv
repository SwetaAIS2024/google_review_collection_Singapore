KS Teng,5,"A cozy and cozy little restaurant. We ordered one of the daily lunch sets and the curry pork chop rice. The curry itself tastes good and the portions are quite generous. Overall, it's a sweet little place that I'd gladly come back to if I'm ever in the neighborhood again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115797056317203402190/reviews

Felix Ng,5,"Found this place during a ride. There is nothing to talk about except the Shima hokke .
It's gooddddddd~
It's a bit on the pricey side, Shima hokke, rice, miso, and hot tea at $33. Yet again, it's good.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117360859119597254804/reviews
