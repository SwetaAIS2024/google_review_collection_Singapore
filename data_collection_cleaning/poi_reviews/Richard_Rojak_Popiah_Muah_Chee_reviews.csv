Tâm Bùi,5,Both muah chee and rojak are very tasty. The muah chee has lots of peanut topping! I could see he made them very carefully.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115582313427411421937/reviews
Vincent T.,1,"Bought 2 popiah on this day at 7.30pm, told vendor I’d want to come back to pick it up, instead of waiting for it. Paid him and I just went around the corner to POSB ATM to do my thing. Went back to pick it up and took a 10-15min walk home. It was a cool evening as it rained heavily earlier. Brought it back into an air conditioned room, went for shower and sat down to start on the popiah at 8.15pm. It was spoilt! The smell was obvious! Has he sold me leftovers?! Didn’t think it was worth going back as he would most likely deny responsibility. Would leave zero star if I could!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109129540881860518927/reviews
Athanasius Ooi Xiehui,5,I went there in the evening for dinner. Ate at the zi char stall next to the rojak stall and ordered the rojak and muah chee for dessert. Really enjoyed the muah chee as it is not too sweet which was really good and it was really soft. The rojak was nice and refreshing as well!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104559593965125541445/reviews
