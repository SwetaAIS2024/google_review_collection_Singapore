Q Salleh,5,"I couldn‚Äôt iterate enough on how professional and amazing Dr. Pang and his team is. I went through eye bag removal + undereye fillers, 2+ years ago and the results were immediate and yield a positive change in the way I look. I came back two years after to try HIFU + Profhilo skin booster. It‚Äôs been a day only however my skin has become more radiant. Dr. Pang also did a touch up to my under eyes and I‚Äôm so so happy and satisfied with the results.

The process was painless and I was well taken care of by him and his team of nurses whom are very friendly and nice! Explanation on the treatments I received from Dr. Pang was clear and concise.

Honestly, grateful to chance upon ADS clinic and will be looking forward to come back. I have seek dental services from them as well years prior. Highly recommend ADS clinic without a doubt‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you again.
