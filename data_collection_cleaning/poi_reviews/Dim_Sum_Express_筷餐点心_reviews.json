The Big Bao, which typically costs $2 at most places, including well-known brands like Nam Kee Pau, is only $1.50 here and it's not dry at all—it's juicy! I had a messy time eating it as the sauce gushed out.\n\nThe har gow might resemble those from frozen packets sold in supermarkets, but I'm certain it isn't. It tastes good too!",

Custard bun too.\nChar siew Chee Cheong fun portion is small and seems like reheat from an earlier prep portion, porridge is a tad watery for this version.\nBut hey, at $1.50 per dish, any dish, and just wanting a quick snack-and-go, this is fine.\nAtmosphere 3 star because it's a HDB coffeeshop, and a strong stench at the toilet.\nThe stall person served fast and good, thus a full 5 star",
