Melvin Lim,5,"This restaurant is near my home and I've always seen a crowd outside waiting to get in. Finally I decided to try it with my GF this weekend. Making the reservation is easy on Chope and their slots are quite readily available.

We had too much meat for dinner the night before so we decided to go ""light"". My GF had the Avocado Superfood Green Platter and I went for the Populus Scramble. The Green platter has a piece of toast (quite a big one) spread with avocado slices and avocado puree topped with a variety of greens and feta cheese. The actual plate is much bigger than that on the photo. The Populus Scramble eggs is heavenly.

We enjoyed the food a lot. The atmosphere.. well it's crowded and noisy. We were seated on the ground floor next to the counter, they have seating on the second floor as well. Not sure how that is.

When we were received at the door, we were told that there is a dinning time limited of 75-mins! So that's 1 hour and 15 mins? Hmm... not sure if they really enforce this. In my opinion 90-mins is acceptable.

I may circle back to them again but there were just too many brunch places around that area.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108538147964918099161/reviews
J U,5,"Great location! It’s a cosy and comfortable cafe with great menu and coffee. Food Portion is big, it is sufficient for 2 small eaters to share. Price is a little high but it’s worth it if you  are looking for a good breakfast place to give yourself or loved ones a treat.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110523847369417455546/reviews
Keng Cheong Tan,5,"Very popular brunch place that offers a wide selection of western style dishes, both savory and sweet dishes. The beverage list also offers a wide variety of coffee, tea and soft drinks. A nice place to meet friends or for couples to hang out though it was really crowded during Saturday lunch time. It is not hard to see why it is so popular",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102762619432424724330/reviews
Jed Lim,5,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND the roasted halibut soba. Crispy fish with a flaky and moist inside, with a refreshing and zesty soba - an amazing mouthwatering contrast.

Good creamy 6oz white with a double shot in each cup of their coffees! It was rich in taste with a full bodied taste profile. Their chocolate (original dark 70%) was rich as well!

Atmosphere was nice with a fair amount of seating with a modern industrial chic vibe.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117253079624937810015/reviews
Ming Hui,5,Finally tried this cafe that was well known for a long time. Used to have long queues at meal times. This time I tried it at around 2pm plus and it was spacious. Overall I think the food quality is still good but maybe slightly lack the modern taste of the recent new cafes. But still a good eat nonetheless.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108198322351045531056/reviews
