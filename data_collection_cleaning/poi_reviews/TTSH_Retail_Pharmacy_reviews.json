If you have an appointment at this hospital and god forbid have a new medicine prescribed to you, get ready to spend the whole day at the hospital. Won’t have anytime to do anything that day.\n\nLuckily they have a delivery system to get your medication replenish, but it doesn’t work if you get prescribe a new medication.\n\nThe wait at the pharmacy is the worst! At a LEAST 2 hour wait. Have to wait an hour just to get registered and an additional hour to get your medications.\n\nWOW just wow. They really need to improvise their system.",

I don’t have good suggestion but I sure there is always solutions to all problems. Saw few robot arms behind the counters, are these installed for some time already but why they are not used?",

      "text": "The collection of the medicine at B2 pharmacy is horrible. Everytime have towait at least one & half hour. Even after taking the queue number, i went to see doctor, after more than 1hr plus, go to the miss queue counter, still have to wait at least 8 person, i really feel frustrated about how TTSH management handle the pharmacy for inefficiency, i understand there are a lot of people collecting medicine, but i can say TTSH is the worst hospital for collecting medication.\nI did see a few counter is empty, since the crowd are so overwhelming, why they don't open more counter and let the patient wait shorter. As i am now in the pharmacy, what i see & write is true, no making up story. If today my medicine not urgent, i will ask for delivery, where got time to waste on this kind of poor management.",

The numbers are jumbled up badly, you’re constantly staring at the screen and at a variety of letters and numbers popping up randomly.  I see old folks weary of waiting, tired and even dozing off.  What an absolute waste of time, no improvement to their service and processes after all these years!  Please opt for home delivery!!!",
