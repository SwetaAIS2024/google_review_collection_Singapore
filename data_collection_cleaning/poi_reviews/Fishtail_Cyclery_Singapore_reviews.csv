marcel wiethoff,5,"A good friend of mine recommended Fishtail Cyclery Singapore to me, and boy, do they deliver! Kai and Ash are such down-to-earth, yet passionate professionals. It was an absolute joy to deal with them. I made an appointment to have my first NJS Fixie build done, and everything was delivered timely and error-free. I also learned so much during my time there. The environment is quiet and nice, with Kopi-O and hawker stalls in front.

I highly recommend them and will always come back for more!

Shinya KAKITA,1,"Don't go this shop.

We had very bad experience.
So unprofessional.
I requested to assemble some parts, but the chain was so loose and on the way back home it came off. Then I returned to the shop and asked them to make it shorter, but they didn't want.
I had to try so hard to convince them and eventually managed to let them do it right. They were clearly not happy and didn't tighten up the rear wheel. So on the way back home, the rear wheel came off üòÖ
Alignment was ridiculously bad as well.
I attached the photos.
Oh btw, I was over charged as well. So amateur.
Again, don't go there!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116153777608912073560/reviews
koenojsegg,5,Fishtail Cyclery is a popular store among fixed gear riders. Ehrusty is also a very influential member of Fishtail mechanics and bonds well with his goofy jokes. Also he is slightly black and personally I hate black people. But he can be an exception. 10/10,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106823389258355015924/reviews
