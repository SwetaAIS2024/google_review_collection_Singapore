      "text": "Chanced upon this stall selling western the other day when i came this coffeeshop for the fishball noodle within the same coffeeshop. Happen to be running some errand nearby and decided to come by again to try the western food. Coffeeshop was crowded in the evening, not easy to get a table. This stall offer most dishes that other coffeeshop/hawker centre western would offer. I ordered the chicken chop which was SGD$7.50, was given a buzzer after payment was made.\n\nFood didn't took long to be ready. The dish came with the standard sides of coleslaw, baked bean and fries. Chicken chop was well seasoned and comes with black pepper gravy. Fries was crispy but was over fried as you can see from the color.\n\nOverall, food was okay but nothing spectacular. Interestingly, they also serve other items like fried oyster, char kway teow and fried hokkien mee.",
