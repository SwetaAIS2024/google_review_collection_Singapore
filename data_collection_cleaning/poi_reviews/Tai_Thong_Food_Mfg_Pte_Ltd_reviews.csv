CSF Lee,5,"The mee sua produced here is the best.  This is an iconic brand and great product of Singapore. I still  prefer mee sua in terms of taste and texture for our local cuisine over japanese somen, korean cold noodle or taiwanese mian xian.  It amazing and cooks ever so fast like a minute. This is great to use during Chinese New Year celebrations.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100855192208188855874/reviews
