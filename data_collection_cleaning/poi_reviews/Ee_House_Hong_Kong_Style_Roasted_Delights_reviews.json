      "text": "Very tasty smoked duck. The sausage has a great char taste. Char siew was nicely caramelized n juicy too. The herbs taste is very good as well in the herbal duck.\nThe premium combo is very worth it!\n\n1 dollar opening promo for duck noodles or rice is also great value for money. However, get the rice as the noodles with the sauce is a little too sweet.",

      "text": "$1 smoked duck noodle or rice!!!\nOpening Promotion was on when we went yesterday (Sunday, 12 March). There was a constant queue, but it moved quite fast.\n\nEat-in or take-away still $1.\nBUT eating-in has its perks!\nThere is free unlimited self-service soup. Soup was very tasty had pork, chicken feet, radish, old cucumber, cabbage, corn, carrots, goji berries, red dates inside... Not sure if there are other ingredients coz that's all I saw in it.\n\nWe also tried the Mala 3 treasure noodle (‰∏âÂÆùÈù¢) for $5 (char shao, shao rou and chinese sausage). The meats were done really well and tasted good üëçüèª\n\nHope this promo will last a little longer. $1 where to find nowadays?!\n\n***updated: went again on Monday, 13 March. Added chinese sausage to the $1 promo noodle, and tau gua to another, and one $1 promo noodle, total for 3 pax, total only paid $5.20... SERIOUSLY... Where to find üò≥üëçüèª",
