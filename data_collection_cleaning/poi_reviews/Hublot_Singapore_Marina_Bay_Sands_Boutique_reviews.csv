Philip Wvk,5,"Truly an experience! The whole experience at the Hublot store was fantastic.
Bonnie gave me a great introduction to the Hublot brand and let me try on everything I wanted.
That's what a visit to a boutique is all about for me! Seeing something new and getting to know other brands. Away from online and towards personal advice, which Bonnie did exceptionally well.

I felt very comfortable and would be happy to come back.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100328101174772991679/reviews
