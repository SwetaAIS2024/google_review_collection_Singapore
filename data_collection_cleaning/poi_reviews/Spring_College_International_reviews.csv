wine wine,5,"Now, I am attending LCCI at JE. David Wong is a fantastic lecturer, especially if you're focused on doing well in exams. He teaches the material in a way that's easy to grasp and remember, and his funny approach keeps you engaged.
He also provides specific and helpful exam tips and clear strategies for understanding his lessons and preparing for assessments.
The school's facilities are also a great asset. The only minor issue I've noticed is that some of the monitors can experience a little lag. Regardless, David is definitely a lecturer who helps you feel ready for anything!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102505957882434141713/reviews
pradeep saini,5,"I recently completed my Advanced Diploma from Spring International College, and I couldn’t be happier with my experience. The faculty was knowledgeable and supportive, providing practical insights that truly enhanced my learning. The curriculum was well-structured, focusing on real-world applications that have prepared me well for my career in hospitality and tourism management. The staff was always helpful, and the learning environment was positive and motivating. I highly recommend Spring International College to anyone looking to advance their education and skills. Thank you for a great experience",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113369982506569627738/reviews
Katy C,1,"Dont even think about wasting your money here. The staffs are not professional at all. They are like mid high school students forced to do an administration job. They mix 5 students with 5 different levels in one class. Had i not complaint because on the first day the teacher ignored me completely, i wouldnt have anything to do. After they changed the teacher, she couldnt even speak english! WTH. Imagine trying to communicate with chinese who doesnt speak english who tries to teach you chinese language!
And when we complain, they only said that they have told that there are different levels in the class.
The building is so old and sucks. The staffs dont have any interest in helping us.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107204355566880580198/reviews
Yichen Zhang,1,"Had an interview with the company; it was the rudest interview I’ve ever had in my life.

It was rather a trial than an interview, with constant interrogation to make you feel like a criminal.

If they treat their potential employees like this, one can only imagine how they will treat their students.

I question the legitimacy of this company.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110153420576447443352/reviews
