      "text": "I had a fantastic experience at Sin Kang TCM Clinic in Paya Lebar Square. The staff were warm, professional, and attentive from the moment I stepped in. The physician took time to understand my condition thoroughly and explained the treatment plan clearly. The therapy was effective and I felt noticeable relief even after just one session. The environment is clean, calming, and well-maintained, which made the whole experience even better. I really appreciate their holistic approach and genuine care for patients. Will definitely be returning and recommending them to others!",

      "text": "Was feeling very lethargic for a while and not been sleeping peacefully. Walked past this TCM one day and decided to get some treatment. I felt better with more energy after first week.\n\nHowever, I was flabagasted by the pricing. While there was no very specific charges to my accupuncture, the doctor charged randomly for whatever she deem fit for the issues I mentioned, some not particular to my request and it ballooned to $200 over. First time ever I had such expensive accupuncture.\nThen in my most recent treatment. I just casually mentioned that I had diarrhea from drinking coconut water a week ago and had recovered. Then she said I should warm my tummy and shone a red infra red light on my tummy, not knowing it was chargeable as all the tcm Ive been to never charge this. End of treatment I got a bill with a so called Moxibustion lamp costing me $45.\nI think this is daylight robery. This group like many new budding TCMs in malls are setting a bad standard for TCM practice.\nI will go back to some more reasonable and good ones like 北京同仁堂and 中华中医at New Upper Changi.\nI will not do their accupuncture again.",
