Catherine Lei,1,"Very understaffed branch. Only 2 person in counters 1 serving personal transactions and another probably corporate / business banking. If you have 9-10 people in front of you , waiting time is at least more than an hour. Too inefficient. Can you imagine how much time we lost just by waiting for a simple transaction done.
After waited for 1.5 hours, the Q only moved 6 numbers, and yet the downstairs account staff brought up another customer to use the teller cut into the Q again. What about us who had been waiting in vain ? Why is it so inconsiderate and unfair to the people who had been in the Q ?",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112583841559106436994/reviews

Keith Soh,2,"The one at counter 6 was rude and abit rush, I was quiet because I felt uncomfortable with the way he approached me and my mum. And I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, because I just want to open a joint account with my mum(my mum was the one handling it). So I just get over it and waited patiently. When he asked for signature, I hesitated because I knew the importance of signing correctly. But I did some mistake, then the consultant ask if I have mental issue dued to me being quiet and having the problem of signing correctly, which i find it rude. Because it's none of his concern, his job is to do it ethically and professionally. Not to ask some personal question which does not concern him.
I maybe quiet but that should not result in this kind of attitude, and I didn't do anything that is selfish or act rude too.

We are all human, treat with respect equally.

Emak Ahn,1,"If it was possible to give 0, I would. Understaffed. So many customers, only two counter opened. Front staffs are also barely friendly and unhelpful. I carried my 8 month old up the staircase while dragging diaper bag, without anyone offering help to let me take the lift. And now we are up here, it's stuffy. Aircon cannot feel. There's over 20 people up here. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ all the smells while waiting.....",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105995950264503989720/reviews
