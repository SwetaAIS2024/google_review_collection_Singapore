Darren Chen,5,"5 Stars üåü tuition center covers PSLE syllabus thoroughly while also focusing on conceptual clarity.

Esha Kiran,5,"I am an ex-student currently studying at Catholic Junior College. I came to Five Star Tuition Centre for English and Science. The teachers are incredibly energetic and lively, making every class engaging and enjoyable. They go above and beyond to ensure we thoroughly understand the topics.

The In-house worksheets and detailed notes are thoughtfully crafted, helping us grasp complex concepts easily. What stands out is the personalized attention given to each student even though classes were for 1.5 hours, which greatly boosted my confidence and performance. Workshops were also specially and carefully planned out by Ms Mani, providing us with detailed materials while pushing us beyond our limits. She even went the extra mile by teaching us advanced concepts and new knowledge beyond the regular syllabus.

The centre's supportive and encouraging environment made learning a truly enriching experience. I am truly grateful for the dedication and hard work of the teachers, who made a significant difference in my academic journey.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114530994368126302781/reviews

Siang Huat Lim,5,"We are so blessed with a team of dedicated and responsible tutors at Five Star Tuition to teach my P6 twins. The Centre provided very detailed notes and materials to ensure they are well prepared for PSLE. My girl‚Äôs math result has improved much after joining the math class, and that helped boost her confidence in the subject, which she used to hate. On top of that, extra workshops were arranged for the students during public holidays to further enhance the learning, at NO extra cost. We are very grateful for what the Centre has done for the kids. A highly recommended tuition centre that truly deserves a five-star rating!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103264310816773794955/reviews
