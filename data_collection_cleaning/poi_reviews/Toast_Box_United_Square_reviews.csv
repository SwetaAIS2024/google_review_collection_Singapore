michael lin,5,"Ordered the curry chicken rice for $6.80. It’s a curry that tastes like a laksa if that makes sense! Wasn’t what I was expecting, but very tasty! Curry comes in a bowl, with copious pieces of chicken wings, potatoes and tofu. Chicken falls off the bone, potatoes is perfect, and tofu is great vehicle for the curry sauce. Rice was ok, nothing special. But as a meal , pretty yummy! Air conditioned environment is a plus!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101093200154303210000/reviews

Surprising that there's little queue during lunch hours.

Ordered their laksa, and it is very nice!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116495992746370870847/reviews
Germaine Song,1,"Staff are not well trained. I ordered a set to go and the eggs were undercooked the first time. They did another batch of eggs while I waited patiently.  Then the second batch of eggs were overcooked so I got to wait 30min for the 3rd batch of eggs while my toast and tea had gone cold. In the process, I think they wasted more than 15 eggs in the 2 cooking batches. Please get your SOP right and train your staff better.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100153357463814622332/reviews
Clara Shen,1,"Service staff (circled in yellow) was very rude and dismissive. She gave Teh C instead of Kopi C, so we went back to show her the receipt and inform her that she gave the wrong drink. Instead of checking, she assumed that the customer is wrong and waved us off. No excuse for staff to have attitude problems. Please kindly train your staff to be more professional in the future.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080098221172635602/reviews
