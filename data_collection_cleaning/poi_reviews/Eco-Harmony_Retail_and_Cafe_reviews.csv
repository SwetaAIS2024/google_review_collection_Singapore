Judy Chua,5,"Glad to be able to have yummie healthy organic raw and cooked food.
The rainbow sushi is superliocous that comes with the lime sauce. It gives a beautiful combination with the rainbow veggies. Combined with the braised veggies (clear stir fry) and end with a nice warm Ormosia Job's Tears Semen Euryales Tea.

Makes my day... Would recommend friends for some nice healthy food.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112528407246390258101/reviews
Crabby Dancer,3,"Lovely cafe tucked in a corner. They offer set meal, with a salad and soup. Taste wise, ok. Presentation can be further improved. The soup was tasteless.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100688349581284563658/reviews
Princess Mania,4,Cosy and unassuming cafe tucked in the void deck.  Female staff was very friendly and informative about the establishment. Chose the nasi lemak set and almond cream. Food was nice. Almond cream was very thick on its own.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107320587807657797918/reviews
Xin Ru Toh,5,"Small vegan and allium-free cafe tucked away in the heartlands, with a simple homey ambience, serving dishes mostly consisting of local delights and Chinese food. The menu was mostly whole-food plant-based with low salt, oil, and sugar, though some items did contain meat substitutes. Although the food looked deceptively simple and wasn’t really “Instagrammable”, I found them tasty and healthy, not to mention very reasonably priced despite using organic ingredients. Would highly recommend trying the tempeh in particular. I honestly consider this an underrated gem and I’ll definitely be back again! Btw this cafe is under Kampung Sepang Charity and Education Foundation, a larger organisation which also offers student care and special needs therapy, senior care services and mobility aid repair and medical services, environmental sustainability and holistic wellness (including plant-based diets) programmes, etc. I’ve ever donated to them (as an abillion Impact Champion) and am glad I finally visited the cafe. Do support their great initiatives and enjoy some fuss-free wholesome food too! 6min walk from Aljunied MRT~",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102618825663061051563/reviews
