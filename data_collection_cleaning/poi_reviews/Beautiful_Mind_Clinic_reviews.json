There are other places with better service and cheaper price than this. And I had a 3pm appointment to which I was punctual. Because their reminders mentioned any delay more than 15 mins my appointment will be cancelled and in future I won’t be able to make appointments too. But when I was punctual, they made me wait until 4pm . Only when I reminded the counter staff, the doctor called me in. Speak about punctuality, rushing the session and charging RM460. For a referral letter for any further treatment outside they charge RM80.",
