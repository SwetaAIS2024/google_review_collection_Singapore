Both the bagels and ingredients were fresh and cooked to perfection. I ordered a set which comes with onion rings and ice white. The onion rings were disappointing. Unlike their other outlets which seem to use fresh onions, the ones served here seemed full of batter instead.",

I took my order to go and only ate it a few hours later. Even so, the bagel was still delicious without reheating. The bagel, topped with cheddar, paired perfectly with the mildly spiced jalapeno and cream cheese within. I will come back for this if I'm in the area again.",

Great place to people watch in Novena while enjoying a crisp, chewy bagel with a variety of toppings and sipping on freshly brewed coffee.\n\nThere are a number of toppings you can add to your bagel, as well as multiple bagel sandwiches, which come with pre-set toppings. The bagel itself also comes in 5 variants, which leads to a huge number of combinations.\n\nOverall, it's a really cool place to come and enjoy a bagel. It's definitely worth a try!",
