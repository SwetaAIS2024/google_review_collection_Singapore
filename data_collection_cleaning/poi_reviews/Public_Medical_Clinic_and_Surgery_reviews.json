First knowing that i have an underlying chronic disease(diabetes and high cholesterol) he say that i shouldnt burden the company and retire,let gov take care of u only no need work. Second,after examining me today,(i gt flu coughing sore throat headache and bodyache),he say that a big company is hard to maintain when staff never come work,pity the supervisor ah.at first i didnt get what he mean,then he say he give me 2 days mc can,i say can.\n\nAfter that he say staff happy one when doc give them mc,u happy right doc give u 2 days? Tats when i cannot take it anymore and just scold him back. For me he as a doc to make that kind of remarks is totally uncalled for,very unprofessional.\n\nif u dun want give me mc,or dun believe tat i sick then just say so.There 's many other clinics i cn go.i was shock becos all this years,this is the first time a doc said that to me.",

When the doctor was doing some examination, really doesn’t know what he was checking with just very very very short of examination time . ( less than 10s i guess.)  wasted my money!\nfor the whole worst experience, costed me $70!!!! vampire!",

Then, he began agitated for no reason, making irrelevant comments like \"you think your company very big ah\". I find that ridiculous at that moment how is that got to do with my sickness! no empathy towards patients. If you are at the verge of losing patience and interest in your job, stay at home. Don't make the people feel more sick because of you.",
