For the younger gen, jz fyi, this mosque has been around since the before 1900.. which makes this, one of the oldest mosque around.\n\nThey had gone thru several reconstructions and maintenance programs and is still standing strong here. Located near to Bedok Corner, shop keepers and assistants visit this place frequently for their 5 daily prayers and more.\n\nWe are smitten by the past that we had visited this place in the past.. and with our parents with whom may not be around. So ya, do drop by and reminisce along with us for these memories, you had with your loved ones..\n\nCheers!",

I see that it still retains its community vibe, with lots of families & friends gathering in common spaces (in accordance to SMM). The prayer hall and the ablution area is clean & very well-maintained. Highly recommended for anyone who’s around in the area & wants to perform your fardhu prayers.\n\nFor drivers, there’s streetside parking at Jln Bilal although it can be quite hectic during peak hours. I’m not sure of alternatives but there seems to be a lot of private residential estates around which you can check out.",
