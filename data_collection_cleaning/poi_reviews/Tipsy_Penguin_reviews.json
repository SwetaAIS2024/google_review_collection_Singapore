The mala salmon chirashi don was not spicy but a little 'ma' but it was also well executed. The crispy calamari was deep fried with curry leaves which added to its flavour. The tofu with century egg guacomole was unique. Overall we were very satisfied with our experience here",

      "text": "Visited Tipsy Penguin for the first time to celebrate a birthday, and it was a fantastic experience!\n\nThe live band was a highlight of the night, performing both English and Chinese songs. They even sang a birthday song on request, adding a special touch to the celebration.\n\nThe service was exceptional, thanks to Marcus (the manager), Imran, and especially Sheila. Sheila truly stood out with her warm, genuine smile and proactive assistance throughout the evening. Her attentiveness and positive energy made us feel incredibly welcomed and well taken care of.\n\nWe enjoyed a few promotional drinks and the tantalizing tapas promo—two delicious dishes for just $24, which was a great deal.\n\nHighly recommended for celebrations or just a fun night out. Amazing food, drinks, live music, and outstanding service—this place has it all!",

It's rare to find a band that not only performs a wide variety of songs but also takes dedication to heart.  Both the vocalist are really talented to handle Chinese and English songs so well, the kind of vibes that they bought to the performance were really fabulous.  I'm impressed that they are the 1st live band I have met to take up the challenge and sing Believer, it was so captivating.\n\nI feels that the seating arrangement can be improve by having more seats facing the stage, this will give a better synergy between the audiences and the band.",
