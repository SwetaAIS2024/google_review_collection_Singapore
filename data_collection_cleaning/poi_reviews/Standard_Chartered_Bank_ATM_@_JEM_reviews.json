      "text": "Poor knowledge and service at JEM singapore\nI attend from overseas to specifically to address my issue with funding redemption\nThe staff has no knowledge funding transaction when I ask for redeem my fund\nThe front line officer on 30/1/25 ,she was very dismissive and ignorant about my queries. She said I have to got to another bank as they were middle person . Everything was messy. Then I found out that Standard charted bank was responsible for the fund direction to my agent as they were the distributors\nThe phone contact number given to me was not reacheable as they did not update my details when I gave to them on 29/1/25\nI updated my number and my current address in Australia but they keep saying that they have no details updated .\nI am  sure this Company is NOT serious about customers who needs real help with their fund\nI notice during the wait that they are more interest in money COMING IN FOR FUNDS AND SAVINGS\nNOBODY IN JEM STANDARD CHARTED BANK is really helpful and understood my real problem. I had to explain to them with my evidence every time I go there\nThe frustrating part is that I spend my flight ticket to settled this problem but I return home without solving them because they have no better idea to solve immediately .\nI have return to Australia now and I still could not settled the problem\nAll they told me was to come back to singapore again to speak to the fund officer Vince. They say that they cannot  put me through Vince as they have no authority. I told them that the OTP pw is not coming through even though I have updated my details before I leave Australia\nNow my hard earned money is stuck. I had fly back again to settle this\nVery frustrated with singapore team standard charted bank in JEM\nI will never recommend anyone , SCB or trust them with the funds\nEven SCB in Australia said they have nothing to do with Singapore SCB as they stopped the transaction within.\n\nSCB singapore JEM TEAM HAS NO EMPATHY , VERY POOR  KNOWLEDGE , POOR EXPLANATION , POOR FOLLOW UP    WITH CUSTOMERS\n\nI am hoping that the team WILL BE ABLE TO WORK EFFICIENTLY AFTER THIS RATING",

      "text": "I am not sure if SCB is aware or just by policy intentionally making their online service terrible because trying to reach out to a live chat agent or call agent is close to impossible. After reading in forums online that many have similar experiences, I decided to come all the way down to this branch just to be able to talk to a SCB representative. It seems that they are genuinely unaware of how terrible the SCB online contact service is that a customer would need to visit their branch just to talk to a person.\n\nAnyway, the SCB personnel I've talked to in the reception area provided adequate service but unfortunately, she also does not have the power to waive the annual credit card fees.\n\nObviously, like many others in Singapore who had faced similar issues or challenges just to try to waive the SCB CC annual fees, I have to cancel my card and close my SCB account since even the frontline personnel are also unable to do anything with it.\n\nI've spent a lot with my current SCB card and paid the CC bills on time every month. We know SCB automates the CC Annual Fee Waiver to those who are allowed and not allowed based on certain criteria/s.\nNow I just wonder what if there is some miscalculation or mistake made by the system? If their employees are unable to waive the annual fees personally, then who can correct it? They are literally handing over their banking customers to their competitors just because no one online or offline can waive a credit card fee. SCB has spent a lot on CC sign-up promotions just to acquire new customers but is unable to retain many after a year. What a waste!",
