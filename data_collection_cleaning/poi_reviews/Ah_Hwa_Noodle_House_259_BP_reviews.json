Char Siew is nice too.\n\nMala dumplings is super spicy.\n\nRecommend to get the spinach noodles special, as it would come with char siew, 2 normal wanton, 2 fried wanton. Then, add on the promotion cheesy fried prawn dumplings (in 6), for a super satisfying meal.",

I ordered the signature wanton noodle, dry with chili. Noodles are nice chewy, I really like their sauce with the noodles, their wanton is bigger than usual as they are generous with their fillings. Presentation is good for a coffee shop. Overall it is a tasty above average plate of wanton noodle.",
