Gokila Vani,5,Big and great shopping place. Different from other cold storages. Fresh meat and seafood items. The bakery food was also fresh and good üëç.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105894417248124339893/reviews
David Bedrossian,1,"The produce at CS Fresh is often on the verge of spoiling. I've frequently bought fruits that were rotten inside. Additionally, the meat prices are inflated, and they sometimes sell discounted raw meat that is already beginning to turn. I‚Äôve also noticed that products are often mislabeled; for example, an item marked at $6 could end up costing $12 at checkout due to incorrect pricing tags.

In comparison, Fair Price offers better quality produce and meat, typically at least $1 cheaper per item. On a positive note, I will say that the cooked meats and certain frozen meat items at CS Fresh are quite good.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113566931099441817592/reviews
Abraham Lee,4,"Slightly higher end CS but on a smaller size scale. Think the CS at rail mall has more variety at better prices but if you‚Äôre staying in the area, this would be your best bet. I like the ‚Äúreduced the clear‚Äù area - which has many good steals. Service is pretty average - and you‚Äôre much better off using the self check out counter.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
Boon Pin (Boon),5,"I was delighted to find that CS Fresh approved my request for a product return and issued a refund after I mistakenly purchased excess household items. Their customer service is commendable, and this experience has assured me that I will be a returning customer. Their exceptional service truly makes shopping here a great pleasure.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102908444465285539097/reviews
Maggie Wu,1,"I purchased a box of blueberry and a bag of scone from this store on Sunday March 2. On Monday when I washed the blueberry, half of the blueberries were so soft and tasted weird. Wed morning I tried to give the scones to my family as breakfast and realized it had mold on it! So disgusting! So disappointed.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103632571116079680471/reviews
