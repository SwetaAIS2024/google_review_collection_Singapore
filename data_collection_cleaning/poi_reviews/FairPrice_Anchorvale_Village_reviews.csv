William Lu,5,"When I came the first time it was overcrowded and I didn't go in after seeing skewer at the entrance. It is a big supermarket and it wasn't much queue after few weeks since opening.

It was good to shop grocery here, there are small cart for kid to push at this shop, no coin required for this cart.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
Djoeis Shi,5,"This is a new Fairprice store in Sengkang. It has a variety of goods like seafood, vegetables, dry food stuffs, and home cleaning sections and 3 stalls eg roasted meats, sushi and yong tofu.

The store is moderate in size.

Easy to find as it has a bus stop stopping nearby.

I noticed the travelator is a little steeper.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111128052716293687431/reviews
Lisa T,5,Such a great location to have a supermarket. I can have my lunch around this area and then do my grocery run right after I eat in a weekend. I could find almost everything I need when I shop in this NTUC.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101998729191684176802/reviews
tam tam,1,It's already so crammed and barely space for a trolley to move in and they have to add unnecessary kid's trolleys in the mix. I once went during an evening and was rudely greeted with at least 2 kids racing their kiddy trolleys around with no regards to any safety issues. Those parents DID NOT even warn them NOT to race and happily laughing if off thinking it's cute?the fairprice staff? Nope. I didn't see any single one coming forward to remind them NOT to treat the trolleys as toys. Wrote feedback on this branch but till now no concrete replies of any action taken. This branch is quite fine but this horrible experience of seeing it turn into a children's playground really marred my shopping experience. Never coming back again.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111277611909372565863/reviews
