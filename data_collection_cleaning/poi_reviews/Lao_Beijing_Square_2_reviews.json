The fried rice and pork was really good. Potato strips were a miss for us. The price is slightly on the higher end but the food is worth it for you to try at least once. Would come back to try the other signature crab roe egg white fried rice in the future.",

This is our 1st time dining with you guys and the place was packed at lunch but both of them always super friendly and helped us wrap the popiah. Both of them always asked if we need anything and we feel super welcomed! My parents love the service and will come back just of the both of them! Kudos to Berlin and Belle! Thank you! Also want to compliment Loong Yoke for her attention to detail and always refill our teapot! ðŸ¥°",

Poh Piah and some others. Every dish was fantastic and full of flavor! The staff were friendly, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Itâ€™s a great spot for gatherings and a highly recommended dining experience!",

There were 4 egg yolk kinda display but it was actually mango dessert, quite refreshing. The only dessert I had was abit too sweet, personally not a fan of too sweet dessert. Overall, great experience! Although the staff wasnâ€™t very friendly but still professional.",

Dad wasn't feeling too good so we made it a quick one.\n\nHad the popiah - this was quite shioks even boopbee ate some (!!)\n\nThe general tso chicken wasn't right though so will skip that next time and get the fish.\n\nThe prawns were so crunchy and delish.\n\nBoopbee loves the flaming beef dish lol so we ordered it just because ...\n\nPeking duck was decent but had better though.. will go back to the tunglok branch for it.\n\nGreat service overall save for the cranky cashier auntie.\n\nOh and BIG SHOUT OUT TO PAMELA!! YOU WERE SO WONDERFUL - EXCELLENT SERVICE.\n\nWanted to say bye to her before we left but she was busy again so couldn't find her.\n\n@laobeijingsg @tunglokgroup you really have a gem of a staff with PAMELA!",
