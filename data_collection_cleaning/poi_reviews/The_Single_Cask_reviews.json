      "text": "One of the best whisky bars in Singapore.\n\nA paradise for great independent bottled single malts.  The Single Cask are independent bottlers in the UK who offer their own wide variety of expressions, in this, their Singapore outpost.\n\nI have tried a wide variety of their expressions and can say they have a great sense of experimentation that I appreciate.\n\nThe whisky connoisseur who is looking to experiment beyond the, often boring, distillery releases will truly love this place.\n\nThe novice whisky enthusiast will also appreciate the knowledge and friendliness of the team at the bar.\n\nApart from whisky, they have a small food menu that works well as an accompaniment to their offerings and they are also known to make some pretty good cocktails.",

      "text": "Great service from the bartenders: knowledgeable, fun and always spot-on recommendations.\n\nThey also serve food and Guinness. Everything was good - halibut sliders were DIVINE, as well as the fried chicken. Guinness was solid too.\n\nThe community they’ve managed to build seems really warm and the place has a good buzz. Folks are happy to banter with fellow whisky-enthusiasts at the bar.\n\nTL;DR don’t come here if you hate good food, good drinks and good people",

The selection is top-notch—lots of interesting bottles to try, and the staff actually know their stuff without being snobby about it. Everyone’s super friendly and makes you feel right at home.\n\nWhat really makes it special, though, is the atmosphere. It’s cozy, quiet, and perfect for reading or just unwinding after a long day. Think comfy chairs, soft lighting, and the kind of place you lose track of time in. Always a great place to unwind at.",

During our visit, we ordered three whiskey flights and some finger food while discussing work. Unfortunately, the ambiance took a hit in the last hour of our stay due to excessive noise from some group of regulars, making it unpleasant to continue our stay. It's worth noting that the whiskeys here lean towards the heavy side with alcohol levels at 50% and above. Despite the noise issue, a solid choice for serious whiskey aficionados.",

It's the Taiwanese stinky tofu.\n\nThe Bunnahabhain 2013 Staoisha if you love a good peat and long lasting aftertaste.\n\nMusic could be better though, but that's subjective.",
