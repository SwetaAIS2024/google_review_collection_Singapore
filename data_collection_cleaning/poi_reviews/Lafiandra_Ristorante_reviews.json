We had the grilled eggplant lasagne style. Really enjoyed the burrata pistachio pizza. Service was also very prompt and friendly. Would definitely go back for the dessert alone too. The tiramisu was to die for.",

We had the clams in white wine sauce to start, a margarita pizza, the angel hair crabmeat pasta with a tomato base, and the lamp chop. We had drinks as well.\n\nThe food was all excellent and the ambience lovely and quiet — would recommend this place for a nicer dinner and/or date night!\n\nThe service staff were all very helpful, gave great recommendations and it was easy to get their attention when we needed something.",

      "text": "Had a wonderful meal yesterday at Lafiandra Ristorante. Wanted to visit after watching a review from Edo Lio on TikTok. Since it's recommended by an Italian himself, then should be good!\n\nIt came as a surprise that no bread basket was served and there was no pictures on the menu as well. So it was a struggle to order and we ended up ordering our usuals.\n\nThe food came quite fast after ordering and we gulped it all down within 1 hour. It was a fast game.  Pictures don't do the food justice enough.\n\nThe carbonara with cooked with zucchini and it was our first time trying this out. The zucchini gave the carbonara a fresh and light taste compared to being overly cheesy. It was definitely something new. Overall we enjoyed it but saltiness level can be toned down with improvement to pasta portion as it feels small. Ordering this as a main will not be filling.\n\nOverall 5/5\nHope that QR ordering system can be integrated. Bread basket can be served. Menu can be changed with pictures of the food and with recommended items to guide first timers.",
