Julian Tan,1,"Did not read Google reviews before having my racket strung by them. End up got a $300 racket damaged.

Still went to recommend a friend previously to look see since it was a ""long time reputable shop"" near her place. End up she came back and said the botak was rude and fierce.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117432283633633257265/reviews
Joanne Lim,5,"Highly recommended shop. Has been buying badmintonâ€™s racquets, shoes, socks, grips, bags & etcâ€¦ from this shop for my son. My sonâ€™s badminton racquets has been re-string by Ah Bao for 6 years. Ah bao will advise & recommend on string tension & pound too.

Ashley Yap,1,"Brought my racquet to restring, paid $6 for express service (to collect in an hour) and it became like this after.

Staff said it wasnâ€™t like this after he restring but it was definitely not like how it is now before. Staff did not offer to compensate nor was he apologetic. He didnâ€™t think itâ€™s his fault AT ALL.

Please be careful if you ever bring your racquet here for restring. Make sure to check the before and after condition.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111382204335330205242/reviews
