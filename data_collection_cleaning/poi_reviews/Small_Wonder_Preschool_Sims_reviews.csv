Brian Neo,5,"A Truly Wonderful Place for Little Ones!

I cannot thank Small Wonders@Sims enough for the love, care, and attention they’ve given to both my infant daughter and toddler son. As a parent, finding a place you can trust to care for your children is everything—and Small Wonders has truly exceeded all expectations.

The staff are incredibly nurturing, patient, and attentive. They took the time to understand the unique needs and personalities of both my kids, and it shows in how happy and comfortable my children are every day. My baby daughter is always calm and content in their arms, and my son comes home full of stories and smiles from all the fun learning and activities he gets to enjoy.

The environment is safe, clean, and filled with warmth. I really appreciate how they keep me updated regularly with photos and notes, which gives me great peace of mind throughout the day.

Thank you, Small Wonders@Sims, for being such a supportive and caring second home for my children. We’re so lucky to have found you!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106127662683066912255/reviews
Ted TNL,5,"Our children have been part of this center since 2021, and we couldn’t be more grateful for the love, care, and dedication shown by the entire teaching team. Every teacher and staff member we’ve encountered has played a meaningful role in our kids’ growth—academically, emotionally, and socially. It truly feels like a second home to them, and as parents, that peace of mind is priceless. Thank you to all the amazing teachers for your tireless efforts, patience, and passion over the years. We deeply appreciate everything you do! Claire & Liam’s Dad",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115395147724890211902/reviews
