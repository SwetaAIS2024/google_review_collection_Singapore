Ruihao Toh,5,Excellent food and service from the staff. It will be even better if there are better air ventilation to keep the smell of smoke from the nearby casino away.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116978432908784537054/reviews
Victoria,1,Avoid this place - complete rip-off charging $588++ for a pot of soup and close to $500 for an average sized crab. Prices are exorbitant for what you’re getting and waitresses tend to “sell” the expensive dishes. What a rip-off - really poor experience.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108687636750904306815/reviews
