khrhms,5,"Great spot for work lunches and post gym dinner with a variety of chicken-related things on their menu. Tender and
well seasoned most of the time. Service is always so helpful and friendly! Decent prices for a good filling meal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
Orange,4,"This was my third visit to this restaurant. My first two experiences were disappointing‚Äîthe pasta and fried chicken I tried previously were unpleasant, with the chicken being particularly dry.

This time, we ordered the roast chicken, and it was a game-changer. The chicken thighs and wings were cooked to perfection‚Äîtender, juicy, and impressively large. The fries, however, could use some improvement; they‚Äôre best enjoyed while hot.

The cheese sticks were decent, though I would have preferred a tangier, more acidic dipping sauce. Unfortunately, the Korean-style wing sticks were a letdown, with a sauce that didn‚Äôt capture authentic Korean flavors. The fish and chips are also worth skipping.

That said, I‚Äôll definitely return for the roast chicken‚Äîit‚Äôs the highlight of the menu.

Pretty full in the evenings especially on the wkends",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
Widi Arya Muhammad Khairul Nizam,5,"Recently I ate here for lunch with my friends for the first time. This place has a wide variety of food and drinks, the discounts offered also make it an even better deal for each meal. Surprisingly the rice I was served was chicken rice, I didn't expect that but the food was delicious nevertheless. I will obviously be coming back after such a wonderful first visitüòÅüëç",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105366038139449016086/reviews
Chong How,4,"Ordered $9.50 for half a spring chicken.

While I feel that the chicken is not that big, I can understand,

but an area for improvement would be to give more fries to us because fries are affordable in nature, and giving customers a larger portion of fries would be more beneficial to us. Just like how Mcd's also has a larger portion of fries.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116852952092019913610/reviews
Peiyi (Potato),4,"Black pepper chicken chop is nice
I like the fried chicken wings too. Amai chicken too sweet for me. The sunny side up side dish was way too overcooked.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114036053255574074804/reviews
