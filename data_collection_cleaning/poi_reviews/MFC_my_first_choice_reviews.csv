Keanu Lim,5,"Nice people and great food. The people that run this place are so cool and super helpful. There's nothing like grabbing a waffle at 12am, going back to your hotel room and scoffing it down. And it was cheap as!

Gaurav Prabhu,5,"This is a small outlet managed by a sweet lady. She offered delicious snacking options which could serve as a meal in itself at an affordable rate. I had an assorted meal consisting of fried chicken nuggets, french fries and a drink. The chicken was cooked to perfection. There is an option of spicier noodles which I highly recommend if you have a palate for the same. The drinks on the menu are super cool with an option to have jelly cubes within. The lady guided me well and always served with a smile. She was warm and welcoming. The place is small with limited seating so a takeaway is recommended. You would love this experience. This is a gem of a place. Do not miss this. Highly recommended!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117724735705922303855/reviews
Feri Iskandar,5,"MFC (My First Choice) at Hotel Boss is a restaurant that serves dishes with a comfortable and modern concept. While visiting, I decided to try the menu which is quite popular here, namely fries, burgers and fresh drinks. The price for all the dishes is around 8.8 SGD, which is quite affordable considering the quality of the food. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, while the burger had a rich taste with just the right amount of filling. The drink I ordered was also refreshing, a perfect complement to the meal. The atmosphere in this restaurant is quite relaxed and comfortable, perfect for relaxing after a long journey. With affordable prices and delicious food, MFC is the right choice for casual dining around Hotel Boss.

However, when I arrived, seats in this restaurant were not available, so I decided to order food and take it to the hotel. The shopkeeper said that all the food sold here was halal, so I felt comfortable enjoying the dish. The atmosphere in the restaurant is quite relaxed even though there is no dining area, but due to the affordable prices and delicious food, MFC is still a good choice if you want to eat quickly and easily around Hotel Boss.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101705680991780769178/reviews
