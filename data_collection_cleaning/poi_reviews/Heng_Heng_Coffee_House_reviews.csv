Henry Cheng,2,"Although it says coffee shop, they also sell juices. Ordered a big cup of sugar juice with lemon and it cost me $4.30. I thought it was a little overpriced, but it’s my fault that I didn’t check before ordering. The juice was quite watered down for that price point. Will probably try the other stalls.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151994390288524704/reviews
Jermaine Nei,1,Worst drink stall ever. Who sells chin chow drink with NO CHIN CHOW? Also his sugarcane drinks are watered down n sells at $4.50.
