Cheryl Chan,5,"Very wonderful session by Peter Angel and Yvonne Tan! Super informative and hands on session.

Before this session I don‚Äôt even know how to use fake eye lashes and I was so stressed about it. Didn‚Äôt know it was actually not so difficult at all!

Love all the brushes that they provided. So useful and handy!

Would definitely recommend this school for anyone who wants to have hands on learning experience and theory!
