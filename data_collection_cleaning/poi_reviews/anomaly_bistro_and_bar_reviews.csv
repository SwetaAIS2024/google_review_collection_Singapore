Jodie L,5,"I don't think I have had such amazing seafood and lamb rack in Singapore until now. Just... wow. Music was a bop, and Andrew and waitstaff bring so much vibrant energy to the space. Is this... a secret? 👀",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100440287804387322719/reviews
Salinthip Vij,5,"Guinness for SGD15!! (Happy hour) or even 3 for 40!!. Dan, one of the owners, is super nice and he offered me a glass of water when I switched to white wine after a pint of Guinness. Didn't try the food though but they have a generous offer for the platter.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118160169597444966733/reviews

Belia,5,"Found it randomly because I stayed at a nearby hotel. Their Guinness is on draft (I hate the can one). 1 pint is 17$, tax and service included, which is the most affordable one in the area or even Singapore. They play catchy music. The owner, Michael is very welcoming. He talked to almost every guest and even gave us a half pint on the house because it was his birthday. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAN!🥳😎🍺",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100211828171810454661/reviews
Tiffany Ann Chow,1,"Came here with friends & honestly was shocked at the service.

Asked about what’s a shirley temple and the man who sat us said “i’m not the bartender so i don’t know.”

Then really sir, i don’t know what is the point of your job then.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117416872373449119430/reviews
