      "text": "Tried their #9 Big Bowl Noodles (大碗面) dry version for $8, along with a long fishcake for $1.60, and I regret it.\n\nFirst, the onsen egg was a complete letdown. Instead of the soft, runny yolk you’d expect, I got an overcooked egg with a solid, round yolk and separated egg white. When I pointed this out, the staff simply gave excuses, saying they use a machine to cook it and that \"all eggs turn out like this.\" If they already know their method ruins the egg, why even advertise it as an onsen egg? That’s just misleading.\n\nThe noodles were soggy, completely lacking the springy texture that good noodle should have. To make things worse, the long fishcake I paid extra for was at room temperature.\n\nService-wise, the staff seemed confused and disorganized, which added to the frustration. For the price they’re charging, the quality is unacceptable. Definitely not worth it, and I won’t be coming back.",

Young men asked if I wanna add egg which I agreed to but was not served. Noodles too dry. Little boy needs more training outside before coming out to sell raw noodles pls.",
