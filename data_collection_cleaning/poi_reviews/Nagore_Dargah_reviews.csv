Wisanu Tuntawiroon,5,"Nagore Dargah offers a modest yet richly informative experience for those looking to connect with Singapore’s Islamic heritage. Although small in size, the on-site museum provides a thoughtful glimpse into how Muslim communities came to settle in Singapore, highlighting their historical journey, cultural contributions, and spiritual traditions.

The museum at Nagore Dargah is an intimate space that carefully curates artifacts, photographs, and documents tracing the early arrival of Muslim traders and settlers. The exhibits detail how maritime trade routes fostered cross-cultural exchanges, and how these interactions laid the foundations for a vibrant, diverse community that continues to influence Singapore’s cultural tapestry. Visitors can learn about the various waves of migration, the establishment of early mosques, and the evolution of traditions that remain alive in today’s practices.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109243125213682583986/reviews

Alan Teo,5,"It's is so interesting to see an Indian Shrine right next to a Chinese Temple along the the same street. Shows the diverse culture existing harmoniously side by side in Singapore!
The temple was believed to have been built in the early 1800s and would have been the first Shrine/temple being built in Singapore. It existed even before Sir Stamford Raffles landed in Singapore!
The temple has been rebuilt 3 times over the centuries and it's current architecture is indeed very unique. It has Chinese, Turkey, Roman and Malay architectural.
I like to thank Mohamed, the curator, to take time to show us around and explain the artifacts in the Shrine even when there was only 15mins left before he has to do his prayers.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108110685973303951841/reviews
