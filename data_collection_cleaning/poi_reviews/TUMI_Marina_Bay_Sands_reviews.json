      "text": "We had amazing customer service at the TUMI Store Marina Bay!  When we picked up our TUMI Alpha duffle bag from the airline upon arrival in Singapore, a wheel was missing. This bag is 10 years old and has been utilized on many adventures. Because it is an older bag, it only had two wheels to begin with, unlike today‚Äôs bags that utilize four wheels. The thought of dragging this large bag for the next three weeks through Singapore and Thailand was disheartening. The staff at TUMI store went the extra mile and repaired the bag in three business days, at what we thought was a very reasonable cost. They kept us fully informed of the progress during the process. We owe them a huge ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù for taking such good care of us, especially Helen.",
