      "text": "I am extremely disappointed with the poor management and long waiting hours at Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s A&E. The delay in getting a proper diagnosis and treatment was unacceptable as they had an oversight. She had to wait nearly 24 hours before being referred to the right specialist.\n\nThe overall coordination and efficiency need serious improvement—waiting for a bed and necessary procedures took far too long, causing unnecessary discomfort and distress.\n\nI would give 0 stars if there was an option. If any emergency please avoid this hospital at all costs.\n\nUPDATE: They called to discuss the lapses, but there was little sign of genuine remorse over what had happened. Due to the delay in the hospital’s diagnosis, my mum did eventually undergo surgery, but the doctor has confirmed that her vision has been permanently affected—with no further treatment options available. It’s hard not to wonder if this outcome could have been avoided had Tan Tock Seng Hospital made the correct diagnosis from the start.",

Back in 2016, when I was just a 15-year-old kid, I was admitted as I suffered a cardiac arrest and was in a coma for 3 to 5 days.\n\nWhile I may not fully remember what happened during that critical time, one thing I’m certain of is that the doctors, specialists, and nurses never gave up on me—even when the situation looked grim and the outcome uncertain.\n\nThis review isn’t just a message of appreciation—it’s a message of sincere and lasting gratitude.\n\nThank you, TTSH.\n\nWarm regards,",

      "text": "Worst hospital experience ever, never come here for anything. A&E had 20h wait for a bed (while in the ward, they let an old man stay for a few days after being allowed discharge. he refused to go home since his home was dirty). There were around 20 beds in the A&E waiting area without privacy (I saw urine bag and part of catheter insertion process of an old man opposite). Then comes the admissions/payment process, the office would give u a letter that requires ur company to guarantee payment (which then leads to u needing to tell ur company abt ur illness). However, the other admissions office would be entirely stumped by this form and denies its existence.\n\nThen the latter office would have u pay for a ward upgrade in advance (as requested) and they will tell u that ure paying a deposit but its actually paying the bill but they insist its a deposit. Afterwards, youll realise that theres not even a ward available for u. Then because u paid the hefty bill, you’ll also run into trouble with ur GOP/insurance claim process (u basically gave an advance to the hospital).\n\nTo top it all off with a cherry, after finally getting admitted, the ward is severely unstaffed and the nurse forgot to give antibiotics for a day.\n\nCome here if ure keen for a staycation in a third world country hospital instead of feeling better",

      "text": "The doctors were great just doing their job.at AMK TTSH. I never expected much but the bill came much later through the NHG app. Novena TTSH can do it within a couple of days so why can't AMK branch. The worst part was they not only delayed the bill but I was overcharged a whopping $1k for medication. Being TTSH, I had to call the billing department and lo and behold, they wouldn't know anything right so they had to get a nurse to return my call. Since 1. They don't have a direct line to call to and 2. There is no email for anyone to explain anything and 3. No Whatsapp too. It is now the 22nd March 2025. I was at AMK TTSH on the 19th Feb 2025. Bill is not yet settled. So whose fault? Oh and btw, my two visits at Novena was already settled but not AMK's.",
