Went to queue for the promotion grilled fish 86 Bao Chao Dian but sad to say the queue was long and waiting time was more then 1hour after the cashier say but end up we waited for 1hr40mins. End up we had to Tabao the food and order something else. Food was alright, not bad. Had order fish ball noodle not bad. Also the zhi Cha salted egg pork rib rice was not bad too",

      "text": "Generally great coffeeshop. Only downside is limited seating during peak periods (weekend lunch and dinner timing), all other times are pretty okay. Baby chairs are also readily available (not really common for coffeeshops but Tam Chiak has them). Food options are not too bad in terms of variety. Pricing wise might be pricier than the old school void deck coffeeshop, but food quality wise is definitely higher. Only down side is no muslim option. Most shop owners are also friendly, with the exception of the roast duck shop. In short, food is good and justifiable for higher price, just that maybe residents there might not be willing to spend that extra $1 everyday for the quality.",

I know what not to expect but the tasteless music being blasted from this Cai fan stall is pure rubbish. Tam Chiak you need to control your vendors a little man. The neighbourhood would love some peace especially at 8pm when people want to wind down after they get home.",
