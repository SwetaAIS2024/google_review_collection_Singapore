Colin Lee,5,"We are extremely pleased with this preschool and highly recommend it to other parents!

The teachers here are exceptionally nurturing and patient, and they genuinely respect each child as an individual. Unlike other preschools I’ve visited, I’ve never seen any shouting or screaming from the teachers toward the students. The atmosphere is always calm, positive and cheerful, which reflects the professionalism and care the teachers provide.

The administrative staff are equally wonderful—polite, cheerful, and always greeting us with warm smiles during pickup and drop-off. It’s a pleasure to interact with them every day.

One of the standout aspects of this preschool is the long tenure of its teachers and exceptionally low turnover rate. This reflects the nurturing work environment and strong sense of community among the staff. With such stability in their roles, the teachers provide consistent, supportive interactions with the students, creating a dependable and secure atmosphere where children can truly thrive.

The preschool also organizes monthly excursions, giving students opportunities for more exposure and holistic learning experiences. My daughter looks forward to these outings every month, and they have become a highlight of her school experience.

Special mention to Ms. Chuxian and Ms. Wang Laoshi, who have been instrumental in my daughter's development:

Ms. Chuxian has done a remarkable job instilling discipline and reinforcing rules with a patient yet firm approach. This has helped my daughter understand and respect boundaries, both at home and in school. She is always prompt in providing updates and feedback, ensuring I’m well-informed about my daughter's progress and experiences.

Ms Wang Laoshi is truly nurturing and encouraging. She creates a supportive learning environment that my daughter loves, often speaking about it with great excitement. Her attention to detail is exceptional, and her updates about my daughter’s progress and behavior are invaluable.

Both Ms Chuxian and Ms Wang Laoshi’s dedication and genuine care have made them an irreplaceable part of my child’s journey.

We are deeply grateful for the outstanding educators and staff who have made this preschool a fantastic place for children to grow and learn.

Thank you to the entire team for your dedication!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104060567630255896158/reviews
Edwina Wang,5,"The amazing teachers and caring staff at MindChamps Tampines Point have created a positive and nurturing environment that has made a significant impact on my children's growth. The team's dedication and kindness are evident in every aspect of their work. They put in so much effort into organising various events and festivities that enrich the kids with knowledge about history and culture. Additionally, they create many interactive and fun games that help the children learn while enjoying themselves. My kids are always excited to attend classes, and I can see how much they've developed, both academically and personally, thanks to their guidance. Thank you, MindChamps Tampines Point, for offering such a wonderful and supportive learning experience!""",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102212597093663116122/reviews
Meh Meh,5,"My child used to dislike learning Chinese, but  loves her mother tongue now due to the loving dedication of the chinese teachers, 解老师 and 金梅老师.  We are grateful for English teacher, Miss Vineeta for always making lessons fun and interesting.  My child has grown to be more confident, outspoken, independent and loves learning.

Highly recommend this school especially for the positive vibes and tender loving care. The outstanding dedication to every child is beyond description.  The gatekeepers Miss Ching, Miss Woong, the principal Miss Doreen and vice principal Miss Chuxian, have displayed exceptional patience, loving attention and kindness towards the children and parents, it just comes out naturally from them.

My child looks forward to school everyday and as the year is coming to an end, she has made many good friends and memories, and will surely miss her happy and fulfilling memories in the school as she graduates.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118226921480129932990/reviews
KKT,5,"Would like to share our appreciation to all staff of the school especially Ms Chu Xian and Wang laoshi. Thank you so much for all the love, care, and patience you’ve shown to our child since she joined the centre! We’ve seen how much she has grown over the past few months, from a reserved girl to one who is more expressive and joyful, sharing with us about her friends and the things she learnt in school.

We are thankful for the efforts you have put in to create the conducive environment for her and helping her transit and adapt quickly to the school and to feel at home here. Her keenness to attend school is the greatest testament to the warm and nurturing environment you have created!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106142499556086764249/reviews
