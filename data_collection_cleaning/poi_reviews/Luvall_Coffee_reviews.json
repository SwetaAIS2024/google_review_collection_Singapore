      "text": "The cafe was in an industrial area but there was a steady stream of customers, with table seating being fully occupied most of the time.\n\nHad the Pistachio Croissant and Strawberry Milk Coffee. I loved that the pistachio filling was very generous, and the croissant was so flaky and crunchy!\n\nThe Strawberry Coffee was very refreshing and the flavours complemented each other very well. The made-in-house strawberry jam contained strawberry bits was just the right amount.\n\nWas tempted by the mini croissants too, there are more flavours for those. Have to be back again to try them!",

A cute teepee that greets you as you enter sets the mood!\n\nThe staff are super friendly and even specially baked me a croissant that had just got over!\n\nThe music is just right to allow you to work or talk, and the staff are generous with their smiles and thoughtful to rearrange the camping furniture that dots the cafe to make you comfortable.\n\nStop by everything about this cafe is “Luv-able”",
