The treatment has significantly improved my back after two sessions. The atmosphere was calming, which added to the overall positive experience.\n\nI highly recommend Su Wen TCM to anyone looking to explore TCM. I will definitely be returning for future treatments!",

My father went to this clinic for acupuncture and he came home with one of the needles still stuck on him??? Shouldn't it be SOP for the doctor to know how many needles were used and retrieved? They provided no service recovery for the error on their part. Would not recommend this clinic.",

Each session is 60mins and it’s really torturing as I’ll need to endure the pain throughout. Despite calling out and telling her that it’s too pain, but she’ll say just tahan for awhile. But I never once regret going to them because I really feel better after every session.\nOn certain days, when my headache kicks in, I’ll make last minute call and she’ll try her best to accommodate and ask me to come down at 9pm to give me a 30mins session so as to ease my headache.\nReally thankful I met them and I’ll highly recommend for you to try out their service. But bear in mind, the pain is real, but good!",
