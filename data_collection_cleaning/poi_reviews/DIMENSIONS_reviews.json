When walking, they often don't give way to pedestrians, which can be especially challenging when I'm with my little one.\n\nI hope schools can emphasize the importance of kindness, empathy, and consideration towards others. These values are just as essential as academic achievements.",

My husband, I, and numerous others have experienced this issue during morning, afternoon, and evening hours. It's essential for these students to learn and practice good manners, such as respecting shared spaces and yielding to others.",
