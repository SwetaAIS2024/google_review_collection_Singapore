SG Food Travel,3,The $4 beef Nasi Lemak has only beef and hot dog with rice. Taste is good but not worth the price.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111338621032926493421/reviews
Alvin Choo,4,"Really enjoyed the rice from the nasi lemak as the coconut flavour was not too over powering nor was it too light.

Added bergerdil, rendang, sambal tahu and sambal sotong. The portions were smaller than I expected but this plate was only $6.

When I left at around 10am, I noticed that there had more additional items available like fried tempeh. Hence it may be better to go just before lunch time to get more choices but there is a risk that the items will be sold out.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
Isaac Ho,4,"Had the mee siam and this is old school. Spring onions and egg, that’s it. But the gravy is not too thin like those commercial “Ah Wang cafe”. I will still return for this!

2nd Post: Went back again at 1st July 2019 and the lontong is really good. Unfortunately, the nasi lemak is sold out at 10am!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111250182654380629133/reviews
