Kimberly H,5,"Shopping mall that kept getting delayed due to covid previously. It will finally open to the public mid-May 2025. Confirmed tenants are  24/7 Fitness (Gym), HappyWiz Playground (Paying Indoor Play area for kids) and Yi Fang Taiwan Fruit Tea. Hope that there will be more affordable food eateries for this mall and not just tuition centres. This shopping mall is developed by the Land Transport Authority (LTA).",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113222338250736421075/reviews
