      "text": "I recently completed the Advanced Open Water course with Simply Scuba in Tioman, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the experience.\n\nChris, our instructor, showcased remarkable skills and genuine care for each student. His attention to detail and commitment to safety made the course not only educational but also enjoyable. It was clear that he was invested in ensuring we all felt safe, confident and well-prepared.\n\nOne standout aspect of Simply Scuba is that they own their own boat, which significantly reduces waiting time for ferries to and from Mersing. This efficiency allowed us to maximize our diving time, making the most of our days underwater.\n\nAdditionally, the accommodation and dive planning were executed flawlessly. Everything was well-organized, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience from start to finish. I highly recommend Simply Scuba for anyone looking to advance their diving skills in a supportive and professional environment.",

Chris and his instructor Sky were friendly, informative and accommodating and everything was seamlessly organised. Their schedule is also more flexible as they have their own boat compared to other operators who rely on the public ferry service between Mersing and Tioman with fixed timings. Shoutout to Sky who even treated us to food and beer out of his own pocket. Would definitely recommend!",
