Raymond Ho,5,"This NTUC FairPrice Finest is located inside Le Quest. Their arrangement of their products is totally different from their normal store. Very neat arrangement and is very easy to locate their products. Prices wise is slightly higher then their normal store, but at time is lower when promotion is available. Still worth visiting, especially there's a 4D & TOTO booth inside their store",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110408261386667864503/reviews
Lisa Yp,1,"Fairprice pls send your staff to the customer service courses instead. Ask politely to 1 of the staff wearing tudung near the extrance whether she can help me take some stuffs because I can't reach as the products was placed too high and the only available items was push to the back. Instead of helping, her first reply was ""what stuffs"" with a short sarcastic laughter. After explaining to her a while, she seems so unhelpful.

She told me to ask 1 of the uncle for help. As I think she can't be bothered, there is a young man who is able to help me thankfully. This is just too unacceptable !",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100558067460695248397/reviews
