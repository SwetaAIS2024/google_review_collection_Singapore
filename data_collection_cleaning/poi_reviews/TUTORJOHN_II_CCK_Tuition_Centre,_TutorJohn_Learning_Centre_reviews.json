I went around different tuition centres looking for tutors who could help my daughter with improving her academics. But the search was so disappointing as all tuition centres don't give tuition to G1 (normal technical) / G2 ( normal academic ) subjects.\nI was really desperate until my friend recommended Tutor John tuition centre.\nMy daughter joined their group tuition, she enjoyed the classes a lot as the centre has good teaching materials, the tutors are lively and keep the students engaged.\nWhen my daughter couldn't have group tuition due to CCA commitment, Tutor John personally interviewed tutors to give my daughter one-to-one tuition. He was meticulous in the choice of Tutor in terms of qualifications and personality. My daughter has since gone on to achieve G2 for English, and G3 for both Math and Science. She also received an Edusave scholarship for being in the top 10% .\nWe would like to express our gratitude and appreciation to Tutor John tuition centre for helping my daughter when other tuition centres turned us away.\nThank you for not being biased against my daughter's poor results. This shows that with good teaching ethics and attitudes, all students could shine!",
