Albert Sng,1,"Went to visit the clinic for the first time. Dr Wang was attending to me. She did not perform any diagnosis of my pain points and proceed to do accupunture at the points where where I told her the pain was.
The treatment wasn't effective in relieving my pain on the neck.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103043335666673737582/reviews

Audrey Chan,1,"It‚Äôs so slow and they let me waited for almost 2jours. The system is ridiculous, I was there early but they kept telling me the next person has an appointment. In the first place than they should also give me an appointment. The doctor is also slow, spend almost an hour to see patient and write prescription. I will never visit them again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100896864802656196470/reviews
Run'er Lin,1,"Really slow, there was nobody in the queue when I was there and I was told to wait outside the consultation room. After almost 30min and asking twice, I managed to go in. At the end of the consultation the physician just said ‚Äúok done‚Äù without telling me the diagnosis or what to do / avoid until I asked, and his replies were very brief. After which, it was another 25min wait for the medicine. üòµ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113497834450916248614/reviews
Evelyn Tay,1,"I‚Äôm unwell and saw that their opening hours is 9.30am. Got here and only to be told that the doc is here only at 11.30am and also the day‚Äôs appt is full.
Why advertised that their opening hours is 9.30am when doc only comes at 11.30am? Surely patients are unwell and won‚Äôt want to come early to wait. Why aren‚Äôt considerations been given to patients?
Also with the day‚Äôs appointments that are full, why isn‚Äôt there any form of communication, like showing it online?
Eu Ren Sang needs to be more customer focus and think about how it should compete in this TCM market.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112799568741002197264/reviews
