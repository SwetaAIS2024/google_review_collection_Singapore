sy lee,5,"Really appreciate Dr Adibâ€™s professionalism, patience and passion! So impressed with his care that I had to come leave a review.

Not only is he a GP, you can also consult him for his sports science know-how. Went to him for an injury and he didnâ€™t just diagnose my pain, he gave me recovery exercises and even training exercises for longer term fitness goals, and even provided advice on other care options when he didnâ€™t need to.

He explained my vaccination and gave me understanding of the shot I was getting. Perhaps itâ€™s not a style for everyone to be given more information than needed but I appreciate that he can read his patients well and makes asking questions and taking charge of your own health much easier and more comfortable.

If I move away I will definitely come back to see him. If you ever fall sick, I hope itâ€™s when heâ€™s in! ðŸ¤£

super love the day time receptionist also, sheâ€™s so nice",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115188176141568201622/reviews
Cammy Dzelma,5,"For over 3 years I have an issue with my lymph nodes on my neck, but the doctor I often visit next to kallang bahru market did not help me at all.

I then decided to book an appointment at Kindred Family Clinic because my lyphm node was swollen again, Doctor Wu was very caring and told me that itâ€™s not anything serious (which iâ€™m glad) and right away he refer me to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for a scan to reassured me about my worries that I have.

The staffs is super friendly too and I have no problem communicating with them, and if you are looking for a great family clinic, this is the right place to go.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113642788301713203900/reviews

Lynn Wong,5,"My family relies on this clinic for all our healthcare needs, seeing Dr Adib, Dr Edrina, and Dr Wu. From childhood vaccinations to common illnesses, we trust their advice and always feel reassured that weâ€™re in good hands.

For those who may be concerned, Dr Adib and Dr Edrina are fluent in spoken Mandarin, despite what their names might suggest.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108583083826174770728/reviews
Adrienne Ho,5,"Was super sick with cough and bad sore throat and the current meds I got over the counter did not work.

I came over to this clinic for meds and Dr Wu YJ provided thorough checks and explanations on my condition. He also prescribed breastfeeding medicines for cough and sore throat which was suited for me. Recovery took about 3 days and I felt so much better after that. Thank you Dr Wu!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115200264827022862916/reviews
