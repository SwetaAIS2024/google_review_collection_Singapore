Terence Lee,5,"Fresh handmade curry puffs. Generous amount of filling. Still can find those diced potato inside, not those fully mashed type.
Freshly fried.
Reasonable price.
(Potato $1.00/ Sardine $1.20)
Stall owner are really.
Best to eat over a cup of butter kopi-o
Highly recommended.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113175319567959304019/reviews
Deborah C,5,The stall closes once they finish selling the puffs. Usually by 2 or 3pm they are sold out but they can sometimes close even earlier than that. Their rest days are not fixed. I had the freshly fried potato curry puff ($1) with the rest of my meal from a neighbouring stall and it was delicious.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114371815676267247136/reviews

Takeaway 1 sardine epok-epok ($1), was quite good. Located inside Heap Seng Leong coffee shop. I'll be back to try the potato version",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
CP,5,"This is my all time favourite curry puff place, whether it is to eat there while piping hot, or to takeaway to have it later and it still tastes as good. The skin is crispy and slightly flaky, and both the potatoes and sardine filling are as both satisfying. Perfect when paired with a cup of kopi at the same coffeeshop.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
