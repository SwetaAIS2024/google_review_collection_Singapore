Firstly, I have encountered few times that I need to wait for longer time after payment made at kiosk.Hence this time,I ordered thru foodpanda as pick up order cos I have bad experience on waiting.\n\nI have arrived 11:20 after ordering as the app stated 11:12 for pick up time.\nTo my horror, I didn't see a trace of my order. I asked the counter staff when will my order be ready, she shouted oh Foodpanda order.  Coming coming.... I sat quietly and waited awhile n approached them again the lady said 10mins so I walked out and get my other stuffs.\nWhen I went bk,the order still not ready, with no choice as I already paid for the food so I waited another 10mins. After good 15mins, I went to ask again they replied unhappily not ready not ready !! Pardon me,I should be the one who feel unhappy cos I waited far too long!!!\nYour staffs seem not organized and take a longer time for preparation.\nOnce opened the box, the fried chicken skin is burnt and hard due to high heat!!\n\nHope the management can help to educate your staffs with time management and effectiency.",
