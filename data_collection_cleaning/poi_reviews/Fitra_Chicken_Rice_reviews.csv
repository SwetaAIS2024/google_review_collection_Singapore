Phyo Zaw Hein,5,"I already tried many chicken rice shop in Singapore but I think Fitra is the best one in all of that. I like the rice, pineapples slices, pickled cucumber and their sauces are different from other shops. Chicken not much need to chew and it easily melting in my mouth. Mustard also cut my small pieces and it is very easy to eat. I give rating 10/10
for food and 9/10 for services",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108136876741452160900/reviews
Aaron Young,1,"Bought a normal chicken rice (breast meat), added rice and gizzards. $8.30. Wow. The amount of meat was pathetic tbh for the price.
Rice wasn’t very good. Chili is not bad. Chicken is average without much sauce. Normally for this amount there will be a separated plate for the ingredient and rice but this is just honestly not worth the price and not worth coming back.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112474937086373855549/reviews

Sahidah Kim,1,"I was quite disappointed with the porridge here—watery and little. It’s a contrast to the NEX outlet, where the porridge is thick, and satisfying. Plus they served with a smile. Consistency matters!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108653710924492853060/reviews
