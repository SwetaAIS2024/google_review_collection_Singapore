Thuỷ Tiên,5,"I booked a room for 2 people without windows, very clean and spacious. The room has fake windows which gives a nice view to the room. I don't speak English well but the staff helped me quickly and easily to check in and check out. My first time in Singapore, very impressed",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112764875377199644422/reviews
Douglas Podoll,5,A very comfortable room with a view over the out door pool and some gardens. The room was a great value. We had the breakfast package which was a delicious combination local and western choices. The neighborhood was very walkable and a major MRT station just five minutes away or a bit longer walk to the Botanical Gardens. A most enjoyable stay.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100345695079065456525/reviews
S Pest,5,"The Metropolitan YMCA is my go-to hotel whenever I visit Singapore. It has a home-away-from-home vibe, and I am always greeted with smiling faces at reception. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the location cannot be better! Just two bus stops from Orchard Road, and the Stevens MRT Station along two major lines just a five-minute walk away. The included breakfast and coin-operated laundry are added bonuses. The only small issue I had on this trip was not knowing how to operate the TV. With a quick call to housekeeping, someone was sent to my room and it was explained to me.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113720301390022111395/reviews
