Rutuparna Kulkarni,4,"The place is good if you're looking for budget-friendly options in Indian cuisine. They offer a decent variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The service is good, staff is friendly although the atmosphere is not very lively or warm.
I would recommend trying their chicken tikka masala and paneer kadai with butter naan or tandoori roti.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110088046479668495938/reviews

Ram Pravin Kumar,4,"A very good north Indian restaurant around the area. The taste is authentic and the chefs are from India. Masala tea and Tikka are must try. Most of the people have never tried kathi roll, Chicken kathi roll here is the best one. I personally suggest going for a try, worth the money.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111555649190361953466/reviews
