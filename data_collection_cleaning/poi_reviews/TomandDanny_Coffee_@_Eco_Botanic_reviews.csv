Nurul Filza Norzam,5,"I've tried this coffee before at their other locations, and it's really disappointing. However, this branch is pretty good. The taste is clean, with no off-flavors or bad aftertastes, leaving a pleasant remaining flavour.

Their fries is also good along with the dipping sauce.

The customer service is very remarkable. The guy with a moustache, sorry idk his name 🙏🏻 is very good. He patiently explains their specialty and recommendations which shows he has the passion about coffee.

We are now consider a regular here. Good job",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117665671885530036892/reviews
April D iskan,1,"Amazing cafe for chilling and doing some work. However the staffs are ridiculously rude bad attitude.. especially the lady she so damn rude was yelling with at us , innocently we were asking for our coffee, the guy with the cap dealing with cashier my gosh.. rolling his eyes turning left and right no wanting to take any orders.. thank you aren’t his dictionary at all. Very poor staffs. If you are looking for a good service.. definitely not here.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108124219391253605117/reviews
Umar Farouq,4,"Found this place after exiting Singapore via Tuas. Quite near to access. Signature coffee selection is nice. Tried their peanut butter latte and dirty latte.

Peanut butter latte: buttercream on top. Sweetness just nice to my palate. However the peanut butter taste is so little. But the base latte is good.

Dirty latte : now this is ace.
