Vincent Khoo,4,"One of the best Penang Jawa noodles in Singapore. Taste is authentic, and the ingredients portion are rather big. The soup based is delicious. Can see the boss putting in his heart to make a good plate of Hawa noodles. The presentation of the food is good too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845981260181580873/reviews

Tan Jey Sern,5,I highly recommend anyone who misses Penang Mee Jawa to go to this place. Flavours and dressing are spot on. Only thing is that they open from morning till brunch.

Lauren GCY,5,"I have not tried Jawa mee before this. And this is fantastic. I usually do not like yellow noodles, but it goes perfect with the bean-flavored sauce, slightly thick, sour, and mildly sweet. The fried wanton skin given is heavenly crunchy as well. Generous and balanced portions of bean sprout and boil egg slices",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101262476724504072521/reviews
Human Voice,3,"Jawa mee... one of the taste of Penang.

In Penang, Jawa mee is very common.
Can be easily found everywhere in Penang.
But, not all can produce tasty Jawa mee.

In Singapore, I have seen a lot of people using the name of ""Penang"" just for the sick of attracting people.
Most of them are just spoilt the real taste of Penang Specialty.
Those who don't really know the real taste of Penang will be misleading.

However for this couple, Their Jawa mee can really represent the Taste of Penang.
They are seem to be Originally from Penang.

I would say is worth your time travel here to taste their Jawa Mee & Curry Mee.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112231371052428143383/reviews
