The bread was perfectly crunchy, and I loved the radish—it added a nice texture and flavor contrast.\n\nThere was a small queue at 10 AM on a Sunday, but I’ve heard the lines are even longer during weekday lunch. There’s no seating available, but the coffee shop next door is a convenient spot.\n\nWill definitely be back to try other flavors.",

The staff was so friendly, polite, and prepared the food with very patience and care. Highly recommended to all and have a good try. Very reasonable price, and portion.",

It was surprisingly good with the generous amount of meat and fresh ingredients. The special edition came with chicken floss; while the roasted pork can satisfy the craving of a meat lover. Just to note that there’s no seat designated for the stall and have to get seats from the hawker next door.",

You also can’t rly sit in the coffee shop bc the coffee shop auntie will tell you u can’t sit there\nThere is one table but it’s at the side of the shop and it’s fairly cramped so the atmosphere isn’t ideal\n\nThe location is also hard to find - you have to turn left after seeing the mister mobile and it’s between two coffee shops\n\nI also waited for about 10 mins to get the food but understandably bc there’s quite a lot of takeaway orders.\n\nThe special traditional banh mi was ok - ham was ok, the standout was the pieces of pork belly and pate. The shredded chicken was dri(er) than expected and this isn’t the best banh mi I’ve tried in SG (the amk one) is btr. However this is rather value for money with inflation so",
