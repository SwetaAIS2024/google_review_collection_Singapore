Leona Mah,1,"Worst experience not once but this was the 3rd time! I only purchased 8 bottles of drinks, but 6 out of the 8 were mispriced. Your staff - Candy still can blame on the system, also said only member got discount. Huh? Since when? She's not new, been working there for so long, not even a word of apology. Why so lazy, unable went out to take a look at the price displayed? Rather than let your other staff suggest. Your another staff also quickly pulled off the discounted price tag on the shelf, why
huh? Prevent me from taking pic ah. Better check all your items before you leave the place. I was charged more, a difference of 70cents, but it's the integrity and honesty that count! What if there are more shoppers involved? Dun think busy housewives will take a second look at their receipts. I only bought 8 bottles, she need to take so long to count, still can counted wrongly again. Hello only 8 bottles of drinks, as if I bought 80 bottles. Can't imagine the outcome.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112282286692709367562/reviews
