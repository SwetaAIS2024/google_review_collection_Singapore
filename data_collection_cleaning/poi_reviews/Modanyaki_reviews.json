      "text": "Dropped by an okonomiyaki shop at Takashimaya for a quick bite and tried their modanyaki. It was pretty decent overall—drizzled with tomato sauce and mayonnaise, giving it that familiar sweet and tangy kick.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed were the fried eggs and noodles; they were flavorful and well-cooked, adding a nice texture to the dish. Not the most mind-blowing okonomiyaki I’ve had, but it hit the spot if you’re craving something warm and comforting. However, their takoyaki doesn’t meet my standards.",

The cabbage has been parboiled. There is a slice of ham. The noodles are well seasoned and it is topped with a scrambled egg with teriyaki and mayonnaise.",
