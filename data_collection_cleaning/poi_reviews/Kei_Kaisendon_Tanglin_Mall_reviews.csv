Suzanna Wong,5,Generous portion and staff offered to change the dish due to allergy without needing me to ask. Great value for money and will definitely be back again. The mains come with salad and miso soup so consider that before changing it to a set (another side + drink),11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117388399328549648914/reviews
Molly Chin,5,Very impressed with the friendly and excellent services provided at this restaurant. The waiter Yong recommended us what to order for our lunch.

Wi Sze (Wiz),5,"This is my first visit to a Kei Kasendon branch, and I must say that if all branches serve food like this one, I will be a regular customer :)

I ordered the Anago Unagi Don set, and was pleasantly surprised. I've not had Anago before, it's flavour was milder than Unagi, probably because of the way it's seasoned/sauced, and it was fresh, no 'fishy' taste at all. Together with the more heavily sauced Unagi, it provided a good balance to the dish. I loved the tamago included with the 2 eels too. Highly recommended.

My wife and son ordered the signature Kaisendon, and they were not disappointed as well. Fresh, flavourful kaisen served with good quality Japanese rice. 美味しい!

My daughter doesn't really like fish, so she ordered the Yakitori Undon set. That was just average. I guess it's understandable cos that's not their specialty.

Overall, we recommend this place, and will definitely visit again :)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109910921424996669015/reviews
Anna Chou,5,"honestly a bit pricey for its portions but the service is literally top tier. i went with a friend who didnt order anything and yet they still gave them a bowl of miso soup - which of course, they didnt have to. even though the portions are quite small, the quality of salmon and overall ingredients are very high quality and the BIG dices for the salmon are very juicy and smooth even my friend said they were very nice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108829167289572867103/reviews
