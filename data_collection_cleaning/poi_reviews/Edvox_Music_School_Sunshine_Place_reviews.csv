Estee Chong,5,"My 6 years old son has been learning piano with Edvox for about a year and I see that his interest in music and focus has increased a lot. He can do simple sight reading of (very) basic scores and plays them independently at home, even though his strength on his left hand and little finger isn’t that great.

Teacher Ms Tai Yun Ming is patient with him and makes both theory and practical fun so that he wants to go back weekly.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107685384587978403895/reviews

Ms Ashley Wong is my eldest daughter's piano teacher, and she is very responsible and patient in bringing up my daughter to Diploma Grade in piano.
