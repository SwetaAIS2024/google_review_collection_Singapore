      "text": "1st time to try the food from this shop and it’s a totally sad experience. The cream chicken and the pork ribs we ordered are both very dry and chewy.  Food tastes like reheated/recooked. They both have a burnt and salty taste. There’s no wok hei taste at all. The price of the meal is not worth it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. one star for the staff.\n\nI will recommend the Tze Char at the corner of Punggol Rd and compassvale street. Their food is worth the price.",

I got my 9 dollar medium plate of hor fun within 10 to 15 mins.\n\nThe wok hei is definitely on point and I felt that the ingredients are pretty lacklustre. For places that uses real seafood I am expecting the hor fun to be at least 10 or 12 dollars for a small to medium portion.\n\nIf you like your hor fun to be packed filled with wok hei then this is the place to go.",
