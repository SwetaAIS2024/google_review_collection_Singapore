Jason Lee,4,"Ordered their Chongqing Sauerkraut Fish (重庆酸菜鱼). It was yummy! The portion of vegetables was generous compared to some other stalls. The fish was fresh! We asked them to make it more spicy.

Tried their Chongqing La Zi Ji (重庆辣子鸡）also not bad!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117371894884760957562/reviews
Appl Pie,5,"One of the spiciest mala i ever had, it was full of taste but i don’t recommend getting 中辣 unless your spice tolerance is very high, cause even the small 中辣 was super spicy. Definitely gonna see stars for abit after this meal.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110579264594051545487/reviews
LILI LI,5,"The ingredients are fresh, with the vegetables crunchy and the meat tender. It's spicy but not overwhelming, with a perfect numbing sensation, making it ideal for anyone who loves bold taste. Overall, I’m very satisfied with this experience and will definitely come back again!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106459694075816220322/reviews
Peh Zhuoming,1,"$18.70 for such a portion. Bowl is disgusting as you can see from the photo. The lady at the cashier was rude. The standard of the food also dropped. To those people reading this, go check out the new mala store at Junction 10 would be much cheaper, cleaner, better service and most importantly, better tasting.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109012552115817231809/reviews
Cheryl Kay,2,So expensive $16.50 for a bowl of mainly veggies and mushrooms + 1 luncheon meat which I normally would get it around $10 elsewhere. No noodles/rice and yet still so expensive. Tastes overly salty as well,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117744338010197955846/reviews
