Pat,5,"Ordered fof upsized meal, topped with curry chicken nuggets which taste a little surprising and slightly beyond my expectation. Anyway I wanted to comment on one of the service crew who displayed great service. My table was a little dirty but I didn't mind that much. When she served my food, she offered to help clean the table. Although she didn't clean my table immediately because there were a few other orders that she had to serve (many students came into this outlet after school), she remembered and came back to help clean even though i think it's alright. That's really nice of her and adds to a delightful experience. Thank you. I didn't get her name unfortunately but she wears spect and she was around when I had my meal at 2.40pm on a Thursday afternoon. The atmosphere was busy because of the students...",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116612441308980864130/reviews
rodney tay,5,"Definitely cozy and lots of space.  Good for some me time and quiet time. You might get the occasional person who would turn up their mobile phone volume.  Otherwise, I find it to be a very nice spot for dinner with your partner to unwind.  The place is clean and well maintained.  The staff is very attentive and helpful.  Kudos to the team manager and the members.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117139302905082545909/reviews
Reynash,3,"place overall good, just that DO NOT come during peak hours. i came at 6pm a few weeks ago and i expected a usual crowd as it was dinner hours, but when i arrived, there was a huge crowd of people. I struggled to even get in. So, this place is great, but dont come during peak and rush hours.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116148392647099881848/reviews
Hoong Wai Wong,4,"Came at lunch time and waited more than 40min for the food orders to be brought to our table. Senior auntie staff was apologetic that they somehow ran out of ice, her friendly smiling demeanor defused our hunger.

The creamy mushroom beef burger was so so, no where near the BK mushroom swiss. It's quite dry and tiny despite me ordering the triple, dun bother with this new menu offering...",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106237336061537561898/reviews
Irene Tan M X,4,"MCD @ Kovan is always busy and packed with people esp during breakfast and dinner hours!! While food and service is well-maintained, due to the crowded nature of area, the place can be packed with people waiting outside and inside to order/food collection. Donâ€™t expect a quick order during peak hours.

Crowd control can be quite messy and while waiting for my kiosk station takeaway order to be ready, I had no place to stand and wait, so ended up going outside to wait for my order to be ready. However, staffs are hardworking trying to push and clear out outstanding orders to ease waiting crowds.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107234303898599875744/reviews
