Y Wang,4,"Had chicken rice a couple of times here and tried the curry noodles today. A good amount of meat and the bowl was filled completely. Chicken was tender and succulent. The curry noodles need a good stir before eating else the top gravy lacks flavour.
Rice was decent when I ate it. Though my neighbour mentioned that some days the rice was a little crunchy (undercooked) so it's not consistent.
Thai fried chicken cutlet had crispy skin but meat was so thin and dry. This is a big miss. Would not order it again.
Chili was a bit too salty for me.
The young staff was polite and nice whenever I patronize.
Price is slightly on the higher side, like most privately owned coffeeshops.
More hits than misses for me so still a decent food stall overall.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107739916947936999943/reviews

Sue L,3,$4.50 for the most basic 1-person steamed chicken rice order and the ratio of chicken to rice was 1:10... Rice was also underwhelming. Nice staff but could be better priced,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115292506832488884938/reviews
