Wayne,5,"Best racket shop in Singapore. Where else can you find a shop owned by a retired World Badminton and US Open Champion in Sg? Run by a veteran couple that knows better for all üëçüèº jokes on those that reviewed saying they are clueless, clearly by ignorant people who thinks they are better than the owners. They usually have long turnover time due to their expertise and meticulous attention to details. Very professional, patient and best in the market.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109444283286680506805/reviews
