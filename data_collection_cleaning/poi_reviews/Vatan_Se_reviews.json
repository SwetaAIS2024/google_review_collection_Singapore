      "text": "Standard North Indian fare. Worth a visit probably.\nWe ordered Kebab platter, Dahi Kebab and Masala peanuts to start with. Platter had Galauti ( felt like ground Rajma), panneer, Bharwan Aloo and Malai Broccoli. Malai Broccoli was good, other items were average. Bharwan Aloo was injustice to the whole thing, execution was sloppy. I've had much better Bharwan Aloo , the filling lacked adequate flavor, this didn't cut it. Dahi Kebab was okayish. Not so memorable but I wouldn't dismiss it as bad..\n\nFor Maincourse we chose kofta and chicken tikka masala. The tikka masala was slightly on the tangier side I thought. Kofta was really good. Quantity was quite good, 2 sabzis were enough for 4 people.\nService was good , no complaints.",

      "text": "Authentic Indian Flavors with a Healthy Touch\n\nHad a wonderful dining experience at Vatan Se, where the food truly captures the essence of authentic Indian cuisine. The use of healthy ingredients without compromising on taste makes it a standout choice for Indian food lovers. The garlic and butter naan were perfectly fluffy and flavorful, pairing beautifully with the rich and aromatic curries. The vegetarian options, like the cheese and egg curry, were a unique and delightful surprise. Of course, the butter chicken curry was a star dish—creamy, well-spiced, and absolutely delicious!\n\nHighly recommend this place for those who appreciate quality Indian food with bold flavors. A must-visit for both vegetarians and meat lovers alike!",

      "text": "Vatan Se, located at Tanjong Katong, is a gem for authentic North Indian cuisine. Their menu offers a great variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. What stood out first were their sustainable leaf bowls and plates, so eco-friendly!\nWe tried the North Indian Thali, and I absolutely loved the butter chicken and ras malai.\nThe non-veg kebab platter was delicious, and the veg kebab platter had unique flavors, especially paired with the super soft rumali roti.\nThe balti paneer was equally mouthwatering. For dessert, the moong dal halwa brought back nostalgic memories of home, and the gulab jamuns were heavenly. Don’t miss their Shikanji it’s AMAZING!\nThey use high-quality ingredients, minimal oil, and no artificial colors or MSG, making it a wholesome experience. The interior is beautiful, and they also offer catering, marinated BBQ supplies, fresh paneer, and homemade masalas. Highly recommend!",
