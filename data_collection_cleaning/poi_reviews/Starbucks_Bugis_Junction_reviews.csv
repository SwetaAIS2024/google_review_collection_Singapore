Pammie Lee,1,"Had the worst experience. Casually asked the female cashier the difference between Americano Coffee and Caff√® Americano. The cashier erupted into a laughter telling me it's both the same thing. She went on to tell her 2 other colleagues about it as if I asked the dumbest question. None of the staff even knew that these 2 drinks were listed in the menu until I told them to look up. The laughter from the cashier didn't stop , it began to be more hysterical still repeating my question on the difference. I left it as that and ordered my drink. Later on I googled and found out there was a difference. And the staff at Starbucks has zero product knowledge. Zero customer service to answer questions professionally. Hopefully management sends all these staff for further training. Will be writing in to management about my experience today.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105002854970803437472/reviews

George Kok,2,"Drank the hot chocolate which was good. However the tables were too squeezed together. With everyone talking, the sound level can be intimidating. I understand the need to maximize revenue. Maybe something can be done for people who just want to enjoy a quiet meal or drink.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105547545966273367394/reviews
