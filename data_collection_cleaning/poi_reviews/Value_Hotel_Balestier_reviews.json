She did told them that she will just accompany us but WILL NOT STAY. They still did not allowed, which was never a problem in any hotel I stayed in. Asked my friends about it, twas the first time them hearing it too.",

Accidentally dropped the showerhead, and it broke, but the staff responded immediately. Everything was fixed in less than five minutes. Truly impressive efficiency! Special thanks to Ann for her excellent service. Will definitely return!",

Sometimes I get a room that isn't that clean, but it's still tolerable.\nThe one I didn't like is the thin wall; I can hear someone talking from the adjacent room and walking in the corridor.\nThere are minimarkets around the hotel and hawker centers nearby (5-10 mins walk). Also bus stop infront of the hotel.",

      "text": "For the price you are paying, I can bet you cannot find any better place to stay. This is THE best budget hotel. Sure room is not the fanciest, but they had a clean queen bed. I stayed at no window queen bed room, and i found the space sufficient. They provided a hair dryer. Got new body wash, shampoo and dental kit everyday. Also cleaned room everyday too. I would definitely give it a 5 but again for the price you are paying, they are literally making every penny worth.\n\nThe best thing is definitely the location. I see a lot of people complained about the grab drop off. The simple solution i found to this was getting a grab to “The mezzo” which is just in front of the hotel so all you have to do is cross the road. Thats what i did. Saved me time. For getting around the city, the bus top is literally right outside. I took the bus everyday. There is a umart and cheers and a lot of places to eat in walking distance.\n\nOverall had a great experience staying for 2 nighta",
