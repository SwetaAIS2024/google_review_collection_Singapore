      "text": "Many gyms speak of their community as a factor when selling their experience to you, but none truly delivers on that like BFT Dairy Farm.\n\nIf you find yourself struggling to ballot a BTO, don’t be shy to call BFT Dairy Farm your second home as you find yourself turning up daily simply to soak in the endorphins of a good workout with your gym buddies.\n\nIf improving your fitness is not your priority then BFT Dairy Farm is not for you, the steady progression of workouts caters to all levels of fitness and allows you to adjust your intensity according to your own starting point.\n\nLove hate relationships with the coaches here are common, chatting like old pals before and after workouts, yet cussing them under your breath during. (but that’s only cos they love us and push us to reach our goals ❤️)\n\nThree things in life are certain; death, taxes and a good workout at BFT Dairy Farm",
