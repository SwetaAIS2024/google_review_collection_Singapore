I like it that the gravy is not super starchy, it has more of a runny texture. A really good hearty meal for my brunch. At $5.50 for the large size portion, it's really very reasonable.",

Love the dry noodles with a mixture of braised shredded chicken, fried fish and braised egg that come with a complimentary small bowl of herbal soup. The owner is very generous with the serving . The price is very reasonable and affordable on the back of rising cost of living.",
