Around the vicinity of this station are very homely eateries, spas and bike shops, as well as Turf City which is a strange mall that has evolved from its old function of being the horse punters' paradise in days of yore.",

It is a small and compact MRT station and just a barber shop in the station. It is located near to a shophouse and that it is situated along a highway. It is the nearest station to horsecity. It is a great way to spend your weekend to explore the area around the station. I am sure you will be surprised to find what lies beyond this station!",
