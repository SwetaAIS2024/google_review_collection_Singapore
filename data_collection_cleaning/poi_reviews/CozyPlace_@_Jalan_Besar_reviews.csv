Sydney H,2,"Place is clean and has the right set up for a cozy movie experience with all the thoughtful little touches in the room.
However, we didn't get to enjoy our 2 hours as most channels had to be subscribed. Staff didnt give friendly reminder when we arrived, that he can sign in for us to watch. Only knew this 15 min before time was up because we went to the WC and informed him we could only watched limited chinese drama, variety etc.

Our impression was that movie channels and netflix should have been automatically signed in before guests arrive. Otherwise why would people pay to watch if we already have access.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113893582163708051897/reviews

The privacy aspect was also a big bonus. No distractions, no noise, and no interruptionsâ€”just us and the movie!
