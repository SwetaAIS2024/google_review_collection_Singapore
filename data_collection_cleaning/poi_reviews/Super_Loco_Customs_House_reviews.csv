Melissa Cheok,5,"Had a great dining experience at Super Loco.. Nigel was a great server who paid attention to our orders and also made sure to inform us what foods were spicy so that we can be cautious in ordering the meals for kids (even tho we didn't ask cause we were too busy checking out the menus)...he offered to put all the spicy sauces to the side, and helped me surprise my sis for her birthday! Great service and initiative!

Food-wise also great (except for the ribs)... my family had a great time n great dinner. Thanks to Nigel and team!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107393755100827957338/reviews
A T,4,"Lovely place bright and cheerful with great view of MBS. Food is great for individual and sharing however waiter forgot our starters and quite difficult to get their attention. We went during lunch hour on a week day. Perhaps short staff on the service side, however food arrive at decent timing so kitchen seems ok. Ingrediemts are made fresh with decent portion size. Would come again.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108295595986847370072/reviews
Jadie Film,5,"High quality foods and high quality service! Was able to store the cake 30 mins before our reservation (though they didn’t have freezers available so beware of any cakes requiring freezers) outdoor seating with views but can get a bit hot overtime ~ Jamien met all our needs and gave us free shots over our anniversary!

Will recommend to others",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114880000546810325398/reviews
조유미,5,"I visited because I heard the view was good, and the food was delicious too.
It's directly facing the Marina Bay Hotel.
If you dine at the right time, you can also see the fountain show.
Of course, the food was really delicious.
I didn't expect much, but it was so delicious that I had a really delicious meal and left feeling great.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108355811703386820432/reviews
Mohan Rajan,5,"Had my birthday dinner here. The food is nothing short of amazing. Chefs kiss. And the service is excellent. Had a great time. The service team was kind enough to wish for my birthday with a small celebratory song. Such a great atmosphere too. Everything we tried was amazing. Thank you Sol, and the whole service team",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103827012187951043759/reviews
