E T,5,"I have been having this allergy which flares up at random times of the day. Have walked into various Pharmacy to consult the pharmacist for help but always directed me directly to the shelf for antihistamine without hearing me out or they are nowhere to be seen/too busy). Not until I stepped into the Pharmacy at NTUC Fairprice Khatib outlet and i met Sean Ang. He was very empathetic, he took time to understand my condition, shared his personal experiences and also make recommendations to a few antihistamines which I can consider (such as effectiveness, how fast the medicine takes place and the possible side effects from long-term usage; what to look out for etc). He also suggested that I should get a prick test at the medical clinic to find out the root of my sudden allergy. Even though there's no cure to allergy, it is very assuring and comforting talking to Sean and having my concerns being addressed. It's very nice to meet a pharmacist who is dedicated to his work, takes time and has empathy for whomever steps into the store. I hope the company will give compliment to Sean Ang for his great work. Please ensure credit is given to where credit is due. Thank you :))",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105226074977415857759/reviews
