Emily Ho,5,"Delicious BCM located at a coffee shop in CCK. The sauce was made just right, not too salty and noodles did not have alkaline taste. They were not soggy even when I did takeaway. The pork liver was cooked perfectly and marinated very well. Soup was good too. Prices are reasonable. The coffee shop is clean as well. This is my to-go place for BCM.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106638367480970822498/reviews
Pauline How,5,"Noodles were nicely packed separately from the soup, so they travelled well.  Both versions (Signature & Nyonya) of the liver were tasty.  Portions are not big so big eaters may have to add-on extra noodles!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113364651456897585697/reviews
Chunwen Huang,5,"If you think ÈòøÂ¶àÂêÉÈù¢ is good, you haven‚Äôt tried this üòÇ

Was delighted to find this nearby my house and it was absolutely impressive. For some background, I enjoy flavourful food and this doesn‚Äôt fall short of flavourful.

Ordered the Promo Set (BCM + Liver) with top up of abalone slices. Wasn‚Äôt expecting liver in the original BCM set so I ended up with A LOT of liver.

For the noodles, I got meepok. Texture was great and chewy. Sauce is flavourful; sufficiently spicy and definitely on the saltier end. The noodles and sauce on its own were so goooood. Liver in the soup was cooked to a good texture, not overcooked either. The liver dish itself was also well cooked, and the sauce is the ultimate winner!!! Albeit a tad too flavourful, I find myself enjoying this dish because of the sauce.

Definitely one of the best BCMs I‚Äôve had!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636541114526759357/reviews
Ken Peh,5,"I tried this the first time based on the good reviews. It definitely didn't disappoint. Most of the menu starts from $4.80. If you add ingredients which cost $1, there will be a complimentary top-up and upsize of noodles, which I think is really a great deal. A nice surprise, the meatballs and fish balls are all handmade, it didn't taste like factory mass production. Highly recommended. Don't miss this if you are here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
angie lau,2,"@ Choa chu kang Blk 429 coffeeshop -
Ordered 2 bowls of laksa, it came in small portion of white noodle, 3 pieces of fish cake, 2 really small prawns. What was terrible was the gravy which was supposed to be reasonably thick and fragrant like laksa should have, it was disappointingly diluted which affected the taste of it thereby affected my enjoyment of the noodle.

Each bowl of laksa cost $4.80 which is expensive by coffeeshop standard.

Management must conduct QC periodically.

So far, E. A. T has the best laksa and it cost less per bowl.

Sorry that I could not help but feedback to you because I was upset with my pathetic dinner hoping that I can have a better dining experience with Chao Yuan noodle in the far future.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106663188718773941122/reviews
