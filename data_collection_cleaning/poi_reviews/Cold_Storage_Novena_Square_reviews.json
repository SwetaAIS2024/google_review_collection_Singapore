There are MANY choices for alcoholic beverages. Self-checkout at exit is the best. I got myself a long list of snacks for tonight supper.",

Donki, Fairprice, CS Fresh, etc are all within the 1km radius. That all said, supermarket shopping experience here has never been better. Cold Storage tends to give off this premium vibes, and this outlet does too. It's just a little too small for my general liking. Got what we needed, and left shortly after.",
