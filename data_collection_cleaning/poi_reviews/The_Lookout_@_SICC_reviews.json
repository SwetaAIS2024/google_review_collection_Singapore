      "text": "The food at The Lookout is always very nicely prepared and caters to the healthier palate. Not too oily or salty, just right for our family.\n\nOn weekends, service can get a little hectic due to the crowd, but during weekdays and off-peak hours the team is very friendly and cheery. Veteran staff will always make sure you are well-taken care of.\n\nAfter a recent overhaul, it is more airy and breezy. On lazy weekdays, it is a nice place to just let the mind slow down and enjoy a cuppa.",

No sight or sound of coffee for the next 25 minutes - after we enquired politely, we were told to wait longer as they had just started to prepare these. Extremely poor service, and mediocre coffee. Would not recommend.",
