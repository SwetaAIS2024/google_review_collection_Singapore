      "text": "Not really a place I'd expect to go but here I was. 20dB Digisound was a port-of-call because of a near accident which nearly scarred my inner ear. I came in wanting to have my impressions done and the audiologist was a friendly person attending to my questions about attenuation, sound spectrum of bird calls (yes I know it's odd), and pricing.\n\nWhen I stepped into the clinician's room, there was a listening booth stationed near the entrance of it. With such a facility in place, 20dB Digisound services were intended for hearing loss detection.\n\nIt's a great place for the uninitiated, and I am certainly looking forward to receiving what would undoubted be a high-quality pair of custom earplugs!",

I was worried about potential hearing difficulties but was glad to know that my ears are working normally. I would definitely recommend the services here. Thank you so much and I look forward to the next session :)",

      "text": "I first discovered mild-moderate hearing loss 15 years ago in June 2007 at SGH when the ENT specialist sent me to the hospital Audiologist for testing. Since then, I have been to 5 private hearing centres and each audiometrician confirmed the diagnosis.\n\nAt the 5th private centre, 20dB Digisound @ Westgate, I had the good fortune to meet the audiometrician,  Mr Sean Lee. He was exactly the one that I had been looking for! Professional, pleasant, knowledgeable, calm, patient and friendly, he spent much time explaining my options and allowing me a generous take-home trial of a week without demanding a deposit. The demo set I took home was from the Phonak Premium range. The other centres had either demanded a deposit with a much shorter trial period, using aids from lower price ranges, or disallowed aids to be taken home.\n\nAlthough I didn't buy the aids immediately due to the high price and was thinking of using my CHAS blue card to purchase at a public hospital, when I returned to him in Feb 2022 (7 months later), he welcomed me back. I bought the Premium Phonak range from him, as by then, I had felt settled in my choice of aids and audiometrician.\n\nI  was comfortable that I would receive the best possible After-Care sales service from Mr Sean. Buying aids is easy; having a person that I am comfortable with for After-sales care is vital for the long haul.  I went with Mr Sean as I was able to place my faith and trust in him then and will continue to do so. Absolutely no regrets !!!\n\nMr Sean Lee is a credit to the company and a definite asset to have in 20dB Digisound Westgate! He embodies professionalism and empathy-the best audiometrician ever!. Am so glad that he has accompanied me in my Hearing Aids journey!",
