Isay Dulnuan,5,"Go to place for real Thai foods. At least there are many choices there, just select according to ypur taste. Toilet and general areas are a bit dark (less lighting) but if you are not bothered, then it’s ok. Else, don’t go alone so you won’t get scared or shocked easily.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105040271472846366625/reviews

Lê,4,"I’m Vietnamese  live in Singapore, and I feel happy when come here. They have many types vegetables which I cannot buy in my market.

But the place a bit old and not safe, should protect your bag or phone, and women shouldn’t go at night. The dessert looks so nice but eat not nice, shouldn’t buy too much like me and quit it.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107014881856813800432/reviews

Stephanie Wong,5,"For authentic Thai noodles, go to Flying Pig (level 1). It's a small restaurant which serves Thai noodles, Thai salads, and Crab omelette rice (must try!).
Love their homemade drinks (butterfly pea and Roselle).",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102299102225370126629/reviews
