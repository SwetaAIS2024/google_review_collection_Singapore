Bryan Khor,5,A very modern & convenient supermarket store with wide variety of Organic vegetables and fresh fruits as well. Reasonable price and some items like mineral water is the lowest price in town. Bakery section is quite impressive with specialty bread available daily. Freshly brew soya milk is served from 8am to 11pm. Also tasted the Korean fried chicken and it's very tasty.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104114346108932279979/reviews
Benjamin Yang,3,"The entire place is neatly organised and for the floor plan more than well stocked but comparing to the other supermarkets, this one is a little underwhelming in selection and variety although that is understandable.

Do not expect it to fulfil your household needs and for those that are living within the condo complex, this is a convenient downstairs haunt for the in-the-moment cup noodles and ingredients but if you want to cook up a storm Jamie Oliver style for example, you will need to go somewhere else or complement with several stops at several specialty stores.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115925722897795932732/reviews

V,5,"One of my favourite grocers in the area, especially considering its close proximity to the apartment (convenient when it's raining!). It's well-stocked with a huge variety of fresh ingredients, dried goods, imported products and frozen foods, all priced reasonably despite how ""atas"" the place may look.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116526984962344181170/reviews
