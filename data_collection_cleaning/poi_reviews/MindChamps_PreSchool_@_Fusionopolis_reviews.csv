Isabel Goh,5,"We’ve had a wonderful experience with MindChamps at Fusionopolis. The environment is always clean, well-maintained, and thoughtfully organized, which gives us great peace of mind as parents. What truly sets this preschool apart, though, are the amazing teachers. They are consistently warm, caring, and nurturing — it’s clear they genuinely care about the well-being and development of each child. Our kids are always excited to go to school, and we’ve seen them grow in confidence and curiosity thanks to the supportive and encouraging atmosphere. We’re very happy to be part of the MindChamps family!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108723591912831538016/reviews
王炳文,5,"When my child first came to Singapore, he attended this MindChamps campus as a transition point. The teachers helped him greatly to integrate into the local cultural lifestyle, and had a significant impact on his English learning. We also appreciate how the teachers paid close attention to our child, providing detailed, fair recommendations and academic reports that helped us secure an offer from our preferred international school. Now, our child has successfully received an offer from one of Singapore's top-tier international schools. Again, we would like to thank all educators at MindChamps for their dedicated efforts.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102646872515905742175/reviews
