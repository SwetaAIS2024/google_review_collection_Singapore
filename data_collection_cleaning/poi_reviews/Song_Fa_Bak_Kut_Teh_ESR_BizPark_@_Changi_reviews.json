      "text": "I visited during my visit to concert at EXPO. It is about 5 minutes walk from the Changi City point and 5 minutes from Arena EXPO.\n\nThe food is great in taste. I really like the pepper spicy of the Bak Kut Teh and the fact that the herbs is not so strong in the soup (which match my taste perfectly ðŸ˜‹). The prok is super tender and juicy, strongly recommended!\n\nThe small portion is suitable for a young female. I think two girls can share a large size together. There is no set, you need to order everything separately (including plain rice, Cai Xin and everything rice.)\n\nThe environment is clean and relatively quite, the shop is not busy during my visit (5:30pm on Saturday).",
