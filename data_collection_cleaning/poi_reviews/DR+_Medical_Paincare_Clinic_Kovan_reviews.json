He prescribed medicine of SGD170, while it was later proven only the antibiotics was useful, and the other 5 medicine was not necessary.\n2. My wife got cold. He gave medicine without warning the side effect of causing insomnia. My wife suffered very very bad insomnia for ten days and only realised that it was caused by the medicine because she saw another doctor today.\nOverall, irresponsible, unprofessional, completely NOT recommended.",
