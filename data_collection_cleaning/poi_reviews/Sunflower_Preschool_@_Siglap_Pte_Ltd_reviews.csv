Audrey L,5,"We are so glad that we had the opportunity to enrol our son at Sunflower Preschool @ Siglap. We were recommended to try out this preschool as an alternative, as there were no available slots at the preschools nearer to our home.

We chose the Sunflower school because of the holistic Multiple Intelligence approach that they adopt. More importantly however, we were impressed by the school tour given to us by Ms Danielle (Centre Manager). The space was welcoming, well-ventilated, neatly organised, and not overstimulating (unlike other schools where there was just too much going on).

When our son first entered playgroup, his teachers (Ms Fatihah and Du Lao Shi, together with Ms Danielle) were very loving and patient in welcoming and comforting him. As parents, we felt at ease knowing he was in good hands. The fact that his new friends also came up to comfort him shows that the children are being taught the right values in school! Our son enjoys and looks forward to going to school each day, and would surprise us at home when he starts singing songs or saying words that he learnt in school. I also love that the teachers would encourage us parents and advise us on how we can ensure that the learning continues beyond school.

The school also makes it a point to involve the parents in various events and celebrations e.g. Parent Accompanied events, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, CNY celebrations, etc. It amazes me how much thought and effort the teachers put into planning these activities, knowing that it is not easy managing that many children and parents at the same time.

It breaks our heart that our son will have to leave Sunflower @ Siglap, as we managed to secure a place at another school nearer to our home. Nevertheless, we would highly recommend this preschool to anyone in a heartbeat, with all the credit going to the incredible teachers at Sunflower Preschool @ Siglap.

Thank you for making the first year of our son’s early education an enjoyable and memorable one!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113244655230196724460/reviews
Jillian Adalia,5,"My son has been attending Sunflower Preschool @ Siglap since July 2023 and we are very happy with how everything has been. As a fellow educator, I am beyond impressed with the activities and curriculum that have been thoughtfully designed and planned to engage the little ones throughout the day. The teachers and Centre Manager, Ms Charissa, have always been very warm, loving and kind towards our son and family. We also love the community feel especially when there are events organised to get parents involved. The school is also very newly renovated and it is clean with beautiful outdoor spaces for outdoor fun. My son absolutely loves going to school (especially on water play Fridays!) and we are so thankful and grateful to have found this gem! Thank you so much to all the amazing staff for your dedication and hard work towards the kids.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111498175325930763719/reviews
