      "text": "I am quite disappointed with the behavior of our school librarian. On multiple occasions, I‚Äôve encountered rudeness when asking for help or simply seeking information. The librarian seems uninterested in assisting students, often responding in a dismissive or condescending manner. Additionally, there appears to be a clear bias in how certain students are treated, with some receiving far more help and attention than others. This makes the library feel unwelcoming, and it‚Äôs disheartening that a place meant for learning is instead a source of frustration. I would write another paragraph about the school's principal but I will leave that for another day. Truly disappointing.",

      "text": "how do you rate a school anyways? Anyways as a student in this school, could be worse. Like, this schools has been here for 20 years so of course theres something good there, the design of the school is quite unique. Ain‚Äôt perfect though, mainly the toilets, hell is in those toilets, trust me you don‚Äôt want to go in there, the further the toilet is from the classrooms the better. Best thing about sending your children to school is the convience of it, Compass One is a short walk away and theres a conviences store right next to it. Uniform rules are quite relaxed, no tucking in or whatever and your phone is allowed during recess which is nice. The food there was good, not great but good, if you want something the westren food is not bad. Honestly for the requirement I needed (200) it was quite good, could have gone worse.",

Instead of the helpful guidance I expected, I was met with sarcasm and impatience when I asked for assistance. It felt like I was bothering her rather than seeking help. The atmosphere was uncomfortable, and I left feeling frustrated. Libraries should be welcoming places for learning, but this experience was anything but helpful.",
