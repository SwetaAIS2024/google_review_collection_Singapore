      "text": "A cute little KFC outlet located in a shophouse. There were only three tables to sit a maximum of 12 pax inside the air conditioned restaurant. Two more tables of 4 located outside the restaurant. Though small, we always managed to find seats to dine in easily. The taste is expected of all KFC outlets. Tried out some new items on the menu like the mala chicken and ondeh ondeh egg tarts. Both were good and we could accept the taste. But these days, dining at KFC is no longer cheap. Thought the prices have increased substantially. Parking lots right outside the restaurant.",
