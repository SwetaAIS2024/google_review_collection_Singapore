However their taste wise can be improved further in my opinion.\n\nTheir gravy is not thick enough and a bit sweet for me too!\n\nAmple parking in the carparks around here!",

I say ok, then end up went home and to discover the food covered in chilli and no egg. A $4.50 noodles with no egg lol I don't know what to say. And so obvious they charging Malay people much more cheaper. Saw a Malay girl buying 1 nasi lemak, 2 Kueh, 4 curry puff, 2 kway teow, only charge her $18. Like that do business one ah? Not gonna buy from here again.",

This is a one-off experience for me.",
