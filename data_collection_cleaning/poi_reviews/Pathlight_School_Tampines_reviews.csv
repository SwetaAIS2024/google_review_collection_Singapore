Emas Aishah,5,"hi I know personally I‚Äôm not a student (at this campus) and I‚Äôm in the 2nd amk branch but let me start reviewing.

first things first, I would like to say that the school building is a wonderful place, compared to the campus 1 building.

second, if it wasn‚Äôt delayed (org. plan was 2023), I might have been a student there.

the principal mr tay, idk lah, he‚Äôs a new principal. bet he‚Äôs a good one.

for some reason idk why but can you explain this, so um the reason why this campus was made was because during a 2019 news report, it said that it had been set for demand for students.

but in 2023-2024, the school both had 1945 students and 2000 soon after. so that means, the tengah, Punggol or even anymore campuses, would lead to the school having over 400-500 thousand plus students, due to the small amount.

if ur looking for me and if you see this, Ashley, Raif and many more of my friends who went here, I was from last year.

Btw this year my class in c2m 2025 is p3 periwinkle, recommend you go here, but students can be difficult to bare with.

Please copy for c2

in my class there‚Äôs a boy who we will call ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù. Frank gets upset a lot, like alot. First day then he act up and then after he throw the worksheet on the floor.

as a student of c2 p1-p2 from 2023, can‚Äôt believe how I‚Äôve seen something funny and wrong at the same time.

also let‚Äôs talk about c1 students. I‚Äôve made friends with some of them, but don‚Äôt choose any manipulative

for some reason last yr p1 students (c2) right, they had changed to c1.
edit: c1 students P3-P4 or P5 changed to c2",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112714747241179085377/reviews
