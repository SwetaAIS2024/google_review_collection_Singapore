Kaye Bela,5,"The young saleslady who served us at IMM had a very good customer service. She is friendly and patient. As it is an outlet store we understand that not all sizes are available. At first my hubby (reg size 42.5) tried size 43 but is evidently too loose. The lady asked my husband to scan around maybe there is something else he might like. My husband admired the comfortability of the shoe he is trying on and asked the saleslady if other outlets have his size and yes, the lady checked for him even if it means she is going to lose a customer. In the end, my hubby tried the same design but is size 41 and to our surprise it fits him well. Without a doubt we bought it. As a customer, we don't only look at the item we are buying but also how we are serve. Hush puppies should value staff like her, she is a gem.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117474217171313109639/reviews

Joey Chan,1,Do not recommend their shoes. It stains your feet and its hard to clean your stained feet. Other brands does not have such issues. Definitely not worth $110!!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108209681856358256886/reviews
Chye Eng Ng,3,"There were two separate outlets store in IMM. One is for shoes and bags while the other is for apparels.

The stores do have wide range of products and at discounted prices. However, do checks on the quality of the products before making your purchases. Loose threads were common.

The staff's attitude can be significantly improved. Especially for the female staff at apparels outlet. Please kindly assist your customer if they require your assistance in locating the specific sizes.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100423115188445938563/reviews
