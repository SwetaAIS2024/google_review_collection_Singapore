Hui Ann Rui,5,"Dr. Wong is an exceptional doctor who genuinely cares for his patients. He has shown great dedication and compassion in caring for my child, always doing his utmost to help. It’s rare to find a GP who treats with such heart. Our entire family deeply trusts him, and this clinic will always be our go-to. We are truly grateful for his care and commitment.

Muhd Sufian Adam,1,"23 Dec 2024 will be the day i nvr forget thanks to this clinic doc.

I just went to this clinic for the first time since it's my company panel clinic and it's nearby my new house. but i guess it will be my last time.

The doc was very rude and kept making unnecessary remarks towards me. First knowing that i have an underlying chronic disease(diabetes and high cholesterol) he say that i shouldnt burden the company and retire,let gov take care of u only no need work. Second,after examining me today,(i gt flu coughing sore throat headache and bodyache),he say that a big company is hard to maintain when staff never come work,pity the supervisor ah.at first i didnt get what he mean,then he say he give me 2 days mc can,i say can.

After that he say staff happy one when doc give them mc,u happy right doc give u 2 days? Tats when i cannot take it anymore and just scold him back. For me he as a doc to make that kind of remarks is totally uncalled for,very unprofessional.

if u dun want give me mc,or dun believe tat i sick then just say so.There 's many other clinics i cn go.i was shock becos all this years,this is the first time a doc said that to me.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110970323841747839193/reviews
Kenneth Thow,1,"Crazy charges and give you additional medications that you do not need.

When ask just to take the Flu medication which was my illness.

Elderly doc shouted he had a degree and I had to take take all the meds that he has given and pay for everything.

No empathy and seems like a scam clinic which insists on you taking additional meds and charging you for it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105006610106477848764/reviews
BeeTing Wee,1,"very unpleasant experience. The doctor won’t talk to you nicely, forced to take medication ( even I already mentioned I still have a lot of paracetamol and flu medication). When the doctor was doing some examination, really doesn’t know what he was checking with just very very very short of examination time . ( less than 10s i guess.)  wasted my money!
for the whole worst experience, costed me $70!!!! vampire!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116752035848763893092/reviews
Renee,1,"My first time visiting and the doctor was very rude. Out of concern, I asked if the doc wants to run a covid test for me. Then, he began agitated for no reason, making irrelevant comments like ""you think your company very big ah"". I find that ridiculous at that moment how is that got to do with my sickness! no empathy towards patients. If you are at the verge of losing patience and interest in your job, stay at home. Don't make the people feel more sick because of you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104282157348383357281/reviews
