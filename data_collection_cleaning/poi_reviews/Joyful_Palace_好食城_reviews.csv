Julian Futanto,5,"A mala place that never disappoints. Plenty of ingredient options, great and consistent cooking, and straight up one of the cheapest bowls you'll get in Singapore. The mala cooked here has a stronger garlic and herbs flavor than usual, which is absolutely fine!",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104932005352909512179/reviews
Joyce H.,4,"Yummy mala, fresh ingredients, wide variety, really tasty. Did not spot pricing chart tho, not the cheapest but still reasonably priced.

Jacelyn Yap,4,"Mala very good! Free mala base, wide variety of food choices, can choose how much you want. Affordable and quite worth it. Seems spicier than other mala places, but still yummy. Got 4 levels of spiciness.
Many other dishes other than mala, service is quite fast. Gets very crowded around dinner time, is the most popular stall in this food court.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110808892689208395535/reviews
A M,4,"麻辣香锅 MALA here is one of the cheapest in SG.

Tastes good & has a lot of options.
Easy to park nearby, just park opposite at Block 435.

Would recommend first timers to try 小辣 or 中辣 cause the con of this place is consistency. You might order a medium heat and get high heat. Small heat and get a medium. Unless you’re great with spicy food, then go ahead.

Again, consistency, if you’re lucky you get the really good Chef, the mala base is reduced and goes well with rice. If you’re not so lucky, you have a more watery base. BUT, even on its worst day, it’s still one of the best Mala, plus the price point.

Can get crowded during peak periods. So avoid them to enjoy your food at your own pace.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104699250362214510517/reviews
