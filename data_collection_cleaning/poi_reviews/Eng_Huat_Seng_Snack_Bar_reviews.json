      "text": "Moved to this area recently and visited this place on a Sunday morning. There were a lot of people as it is nearby a wet market. They have a wide range of food selection. In the morning, they have noodles, nasi lemak, varieties of kueh and dessert. Even iced one. Didn’t expect that when I ordered a sea coconut. Anyway, it was really hot that day. So I just went with the flow. Happy to find big pieces of sea coconut but it is weird that they have other fruits in the dessert. I wouldn’t recommend to have the lime in it cos it just covers the sea coconut flavour. Plus point, it is cheap. $2 for dessert and $0.80 for white sugar steamed cake.",

      "text": "A really one of a kind snack bar in Singapore with all kinds of traditional kueh and Chinese snacks available. I recall there’s one in Hougang Ave 2 and never thought there’s another one right here in Bangkit!\n\nThe shop sells literally every kind of snack you can think of: there’s the usual bread buns and pastries outside, Nyonya kueh and carrot cake, Peng kueh, dumplings in the cabinet and a bread station at one end putting jams and spreads to freshly baked bread.\n\nPrices are pretty affordable, bought 4 pieces of kueh (the yellow ones) and it’s $3.20 only. Much cheaper than the other kueh chain B.S. If you like old school snacks, this is the place to go!",
