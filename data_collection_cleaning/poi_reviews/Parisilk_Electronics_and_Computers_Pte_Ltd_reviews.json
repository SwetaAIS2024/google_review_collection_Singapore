      "text": "Company is operated by a bunch of irresponsible monkeys. Delivery scheduled between 1400-1600hrs. Been calling them since 1730hrs but have been pushed around from one contact to another with empty promises that they will call me back in 5 mins but they didn’t. Don’t order from them unless you wanna know how it feels like having to wait 6 hours in a sparsely renovated flat with no comfortable furnishings and no toilet bowl.\n\nMy redmart delivery was supposed to arrive in tandem with the fridge but everything is defrosting to death because their staff didn’t have the basic courtesy or decency to call to inform if they’re running late. Finally managed to talk to someone at 1910hrs who said they’ll take another 45mins to reach. They finally arrive at 1945hrs where they parked their van right outside the condo and blocked the entrance from the point they arrived till the time they left.\n\nNever gonna order anything from them again. Excellent sales service but the after sales treatment is absolute disaster.",

      "text": "My family has been shopping Parisilk for our appliances for many years and will continue to do so!  They consistently offer great prices and the kind of personalised customer service that is rare to find in shops these days but is so important when you are purchasing large appliances.  I'm able to discuss my specific needs and find out the pros and cons of different brands. Sales people at bigger stores are brand vendors, so you will never get objective advice from them.  Their priority is to just push their brands. A typical example of the difference in service I exeperienced between Parisilk and a big store:\nWhen purchasing a cooktop to replace an old discontinued model, I needed a specific size with gas pipe on the right side.  I had to talk to 5 different brand vendors at Courts and even so, was sold a range that did not fit. Parisilk looked up the specs for different brands until they found one that fit, and I didn't even have to walk into the store.  It was all accomplished over the phone and delivered to me within the week.\nWe've built up such a trust that I've made numerous appliance purchases over phone and WhatsApp from Parisilk. It's as convenient as online purchasing with the added benefit of real customer service.  And, there's always the showroom should you want to see anything in person. Today my dryer broke and Eric was able to advise me on a new model based on my needs and arrange my order with just a few WhatsApp messages, and the price was lower than everywhere esle.",

      "text": "Ordered a fan in store and had it installed a month ago. Last week noticed the whole thing is sideways and not installed correctly. We called the store and they were very apologetic and said they would arrange for a repairman to come fix it. I sent them pictures that night to confirm. I asked for an update the next day as to when the repair man would be coming. They said they had to wait for the HQ to arrange.\nThe next day I get a call at 1:48pm from the repairman asking if I was home, which I was not since I was working and wasn’t given any notice. I told him I could be home after 6pm but that didn’t work for him. The next day I get a call at 1:15pm asking if I was at home - again no warning and therefore could not be there. The lady asked if I would be home Saturday and I said “yes before noon” to which she replied “oh well we can’t do that”. I asked her to get back to me with dates and times they would be available this week and she said she would get back to me.\n\nLater that day I get a call from the store telling me that the repairman had tried three times to reach me and I was uncontactable; obviously false. I repeated myself that I was waiting for their reply on days and times that they were available and I would make sure I was home. Following that call, I then receive text messages from the store with screenshots of conversations from what I assume is their HQ team doubling down on how it’s somehow my fault for not being available with zero notice even though I told them I don’t work from home.\n\nIt’s been a week now and still no response from their team on a resolution. Unfortunately I didn’t read the reviews on their service before I purchased the fan. Had I known,  I would have gone elsewhere to avoid this unnecessarily bad service.",
