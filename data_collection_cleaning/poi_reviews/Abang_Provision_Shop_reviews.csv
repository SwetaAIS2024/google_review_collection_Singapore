Bob Hegred,5,I have never been there but have seen so many positive reviews about it. My friend went to go buy Prime from them and paid 10 dollars for LA Dodgers Prime instead of 50 at Suntec City. Prime definitely not fake. Great pricing,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106777204021469994902/reviews
