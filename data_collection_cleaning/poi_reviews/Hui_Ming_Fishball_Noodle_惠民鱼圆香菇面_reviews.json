Well balanced, love the slight stickiness to the well-oiled noodles, shiok fishballs and all. $4 for the one I ordered. Will visit here more often :) Closes on Monday.",

Meaning no msg added.\nLove the noodle, the combination is very uniform and tasty. Soup is clear which is good, not salty. Very authentic. Now the price is at $4 but still it is worth it. Good food deserves its calling price. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",

Sauce mix is flavourful well mixed and not too vinegary or salty.  Can understand why customers are non stop, craving for that familiar taste.  Come here if you want to know how bcm taste like in the 80s and 90s.",
