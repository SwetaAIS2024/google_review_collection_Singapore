Parveen Banu,5,"I was served by the customer service officer nisha. She was very polite and very attentive to my needs. Even though the bank was so packed, she served me with a very beautiful smile. Good job nisha",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105081848715021091426/reviews
Albert L,5,"Came to this branch for 1st time for help on some issue. The staffs here are really helpful and hardworking. Ng Zhong Yang was the 1st officer that approached to offer help however he was unable to provide the solution I wanted,  but he tried few times speaking to different officers, finally Hidayah came to rescue. She was resourceful and managed to find a solution for me. I am grateful for their efforts. My issue was resolved.

However the waiting time is too long, I noticed many customers complaining the service were too slow. But I donâ€™t think the staffs working were slow, the problem were there are not enough counters open to service the large crowds. While waiting there for 2.5hrs there, I observed all the staffs there, they are trying their best.

The bank management need to make some changes to improve the situation to improve its image and efficiency.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112546480775932778301/reviews
Andy Wuu,4,"I was waiting in line to complete a bank transaction, and the long wait felt endless. However, when it was my turn, I was assisted by Eileen, a very friendly and professional counter staff. She was prompt, efficient, and got everything done within minutes.

Curious, I asked how long she had been with DBS, and she said an impressive 35 years! Kudos to her for her dedication and for brightening my day despite the long wait.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118212886273617974738/reviews
