      "text": "The Changi Boardwalk in Singapore is a serene and picturesque coastal trail, perfect for nature lovers and those seeking a tranquil escape. Stretching along the eastern coastline, it offers stunning views of the sea, lush greenery, and a peaceful atmosphere. The boardwalk is divided into several sections, such as the Sunset Walk and the Kelong Walk, each providing a unique experience, from sunset vistas to glimpses of traditional fishing platforms. It’s an ideal spot for a leisurely stroll, photography, or simply soaking in the natural beauty. Highly recommended for a relaxing day out!",
