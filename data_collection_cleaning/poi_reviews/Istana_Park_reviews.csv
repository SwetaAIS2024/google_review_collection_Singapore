Aung Po Po (Po),5,"Istana Park is a beautifully landscaped escape from the bustling city, featuring the impressive Festival Arch and a tranquil reflecting pool. The park is well-maintained and perfect for leisurely strolls, picnics, or simply relaxing amidst vibrant flora. Its central location makes it easily accessible, and itâ€™s a great spot to unwind after shopping on Orchard Road. The park also hosts cultural events, adding to its charm. A must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy a peaceful moment in Singapore!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116715682666130759535/reviews

CK Cheong,3,A park located right across the Istana and Plaza Singapura that most people may not know or visit even if they past by frequently. It is not big but well maintained and pleasant. The greenery provides a good respite from the malls and hotels along Orchard Road,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114524725497942089541/reviews

ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ My husband and myself met a long-time friend at Orchard Road one night, and the three of us strolled to Istana Park in the late evening a while ago.

ðŸŸ¦ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ I snapped only a few photos as we were rushing off to another place. If it was daytime, I would have taken more photos. ðŸ˜…

ðŸŸ« It was about 9.30 pm when we were here, so the area was dimly lit.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
Steven Montoya,5,"This park is lush and gorgeous. From the (over)abundance of flora to the art center being placed right in the center of the park, I can't imagine a more peaceful oasis amidst the hustle and bustle of the surrounding shopping centers.

If you're in the area, spend some time walking through this park - you will not regret it.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117970863260938809382/reviews
