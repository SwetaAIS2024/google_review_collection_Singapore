      "text": "Love the view from this pit. It‚Äôs also pretty isolated from the usual crowded spots. Which is good if you like a quiet bbq experience with your own gang but also a little inconvenient as the amenities are a walk away. Walk from public carpark entrance is about 10minutes. Walk from public toilet is about 8 minutes. No nearby shaded place so if it rains, run!",

Requested for a nice round table with cushions for my mom but was told it‚Äôs a 5 seater. Was led to the back next to the table where all their workers were having their lunch and next to the restroom although there were empty tables up front. Anyways the Royal Milk Tea was lukewarm !!üòíBTW when we left, three people were occupying the 5seater !üòë!!",
