Only saw it when I was going ticketing office for enquiries last 2 weeks.\n\nToday i came again bought few cups on my way home share with my family's, feel different very warm welcoming from the little training girl.\nShe actually remember me and was very friendly chat with me asking how am I, had I taken my lunch, she alone yet was fast too from taking orders and serving and can handle another walking quickly answers their enquiries.  Alone yet can cope well with everything, and still not forget providing good customer services. I was very impressed üëè  by her attitude and services that's why I decided give her an review.\n\nAs I been parkway parade so many times, they don't even as friendly or remember me as return customer by giving me warm welcome.",
