Eric Lee,4,One of the nicest outlet around! It has both inside Air Con and outside Open Air areas. And there is a very nice water feature where they have turtles swimming around. But Iâ€™m not sure why that here are pink and they have red eyes!,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113775188408100673442/reviews
Sushiliah Devi,5,"I had a wonderful experience having lunch with my friend here. The ambiance was just right, quiet and appealing with appropriate photos and lighting. Price was reasonable. My burger tasted sumptuous and just right. The truffle fries were just amazing. I can die for it. And my lychee soda drink was a thirst quencher on a hot day. Hope you can visit this place at Hougang. The only improvement is; service could be better.ðŸ˜‹",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109788552494394660918/reviews
Phil woo,3,"After hearing a lot of buzz about this place, I finally decided to check it out. The ambiance is quite similar to the previous tenant, with the same layout but some minor upgrades. As for the food, hereâ€™s what I tried:

Squid Ink: It was a bit salty for my taste. I personally prefer the one at Saizeriya, which I find more to my liking.

Chicken Chop Noodles: The chicken was flattened and not served piping hot. It seemed like it had been cooked some time ago and it would be better to reheated before serving.

Cheese Burger: It was decent, nothing particularly special, but still okay.

Fish and Chips: Again, not bad, but not extraordinary either.

The restaurant doesnâ€™t charge a service fee, so we had to pick up our own dishes.

Overall, the food is decent, but thereâ€™s still a lot of room for improvement if they want to attract more regular customers.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107521798402872561252/reviews
Adrian C,5,Really nice place to chill and rest (if you are cycling at the park) great food! Taste so much better than Macs at similiar price point. Portions of the food is huge too. Definitely come back again,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114103615287531181361/reviews
Hui-chieh Loy,5,Good range of decent food at reasonable prices. Friendly counter staff. Hagen Dazs icecream. Being right next to the Ponggol park pond gives it a nice view too!,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114631333018037022277/reviews
