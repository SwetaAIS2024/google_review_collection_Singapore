      "text": "A true lifesaver on a warm, humid day. As expected from Birds of Paradise, prices and standards remain consistent, with generous portions and that signature thyme-flavoured cone adding to the experience. There’s a small air-conditioned area inside, but seating is limited. Outdoor seating is even scarcer and often taken up by families with strollers, due to the tight indoor space. We opted for takeaway and enjoyed our little scoop of ice cream paradise on the go.",

Nice place to chill after exploring the parks.",

      "text": "It's a but pricier compared to other ice creams, and the flavors are really unique for one, so if you're expecting to find a normal ice cream stand that sells standard flavors, this is definitely not one. I had the two scoop ice cream of hojicha sea salt and lychee rose over a Waffle and an osmanthus lychee cold brew which totalled up to $24. But the cold brew was surpsingky very diluted and you couldn't nearly tell it was lychee or osmanthus because it tasted like chrysanthemum. The ice cream, while flavorful. Light, smooth and creamy, was a bit off putting as well. The sea salt hojicha was too heavy in salt than tea and the lychee rose tasted more of rose and no lychee. The waffles were also dry, crispy and hard, which tasted more crossiant than waffle so I highly recommend getting ice cream somewhere else if you're looking for affordable ice cream worth the price, like Ice cream man and friends",

      "text": "The white chrysanthemum ice cream here is truly awesome and refreshing, offering a unique and delicate flavor profile that's perfect for a hot day. However, be aware that it includes crushed nuts, which might not be to everyone's taste if you're not a fan of nuts.\n\nPriced at $5.50 per scoop, it’s reasonable, especially for an outlet situated in a prime tourist spot. The ordering process is smooth and efficient—just place your order at the kiosk and wait for your number to be called. This setup makes it convenient for those who prefer to grab and go.\n\nThere are plenty of seats available if you prefer to sit and enjoy your treat. Located just outside Bird Paradise, you don’t need a ticket to access this ice cream spot, making it a perfect pit stop for visitors and locals alike.",
