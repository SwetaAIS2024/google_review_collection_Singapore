Brandon Myles,5,"The most high quality ban Mian I have ever had in Singapore. Super hearty & robust soup, they could easily cut back thier portions by 30% because I have never finished the bowl the few times I’ve been here. I had the Tom yum chicken ban Mian a few times and it’s super delicious. It’s slightly on the sweeter side but so good.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105394533740286156855/reviews

RCSC,5,"Had 2 of their dry noodles. 1 dry ban mian and 2 dry spicy mee. Personally we preferred dry ban mian as there was a sweet dark soy sauce taste. Both noodles were cooked perfectly. Price also very good at $5.50 per bowl.

Love that it had ngoh hiang as a side too! Not sure if this is normal price... but it was delicious!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101381356185028377091/reviews

Nobita C,5,"Every food serving is prepared with dedicated effort. I always go for Dried You Mian every time I come here, because the flavourful gravy always succeeds in making me come back for more. The chilli sauce used was very spicy personally though, but that had not stopped me from returning!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115632465584200727905/reviews
