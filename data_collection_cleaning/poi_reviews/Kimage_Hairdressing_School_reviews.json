Having been to many pricey and renowned salons that boast about their products and service, tbh I don’t see any life changing difference in the treatment advertised by the expensive salons, the quality provided here is definitely comparable! If you are looking for a fuss free and economical service, I would recommend that you give this place a try! Do bear in mind of their opening hours and to make an appointment!",

He suggested a hair color that was slightly lighter as i wanted an overall brighter look.  The end result is very even and looks naturally blended with my hair.  Will recommend to my friends and come again. Saloon ambience is clean, airy and well spaced.",

      "text": "Good value for money and you are also helping students gain experience.\n\nOn average, bearing in mind that the hairstylists are students, colouring can take from 2.5 - 5 hours depending on the service while a haircut can take up to 2 hours.\n\nThe students will sometimes seek advice and approval from their teachers before moving on to the next step of the service that’s carried out.\n\nThe teachers will also go around to check on the students’ progress to be sure they are on track.\n\nI’ve tried their services for root touch up, full hair colour and cut. The school uses L’Oreal for my hair colour and root touch up.\n\nCutting short hair can sometimes not be how I would have liked because it does take skills to strike a balance between length, cut and facial features which the students are still learning.\n\nOverall though, the service is good and the environment is friendly and spacious.\n\nI’ve been a customer for a few years now and I’m happy with their services.",
