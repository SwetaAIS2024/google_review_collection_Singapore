Ari Eliefja,5,"The treetop suspension bridge hike with all the monkeys was easily the 2nd best thing we did while spending 12 nights in Singapore. And it was free.

The best thing was the Bayfront walk at night. Seeing all the futuristic buildings' liite up was magical. We walked from the Merlion, around Marina Bay through the amazing 3 tower hotel over the Helix bridge. The we watched the spectacular sound and light show at Gardens by the Bay supergrove trees, followed by the Specter Lazer light & water show in front of the hotel. All of it amazing!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105957111314159364754/reviews
Karen O,5,Natural trekking with lots of stones and steps. Small cute monkeys around the whole park but they don't attack. Just keep plastic bags and food out of sight. Water coolers are available outside most restrooms which is great to refill at every stop. Take note there's no vending machine at all. Overall tiring but satisfying to burn some calories.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116720431693328686281/reviews

Mel H,5,"It’s not that bad. Most of the trail is from Easy to Moderate. Those runners running at the trail can be so selfish, impatient and expect others (walkers) to make way for them automatically. Other than that, fresh air, sounds of jungle can be so healing.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103410519575379393400/reviews
