Themiya Weerasekara,4,"Great restaurant to have a peaceful meal. In basement 2 of terminal 3.

We tried hot Milo, curry vegetarian fusion pasta and vegetarian low calorie pizza. Pasta was awesome and tasty. But spicy.

Prices are mid range. Service is good. Food served faster than we expected. Since not much crowded was able to enjoy the meal. Anyway it's a large place and can occupy a large crowd.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106580771608110988500/reviews
Samuel Edyson,4,"Awesome to have pasta & pizza served here in Pastamania at Changi Intrrnational Airport terminal 3. Great for quick bite-and-go before your flight. Seatings are quite minimal and circulation's too narrow for majority who bring luggages, otherwise everything is great.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108333055052140661429/reviews
