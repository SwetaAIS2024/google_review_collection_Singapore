When I ask for advise for certain hairstyles she would assist to prepare a decent amount of balance so the hairstyle I wanted would fit onto my face shape. Communication when scheduling appointments have been on time as well! Highly recommend!",

It fits my overall look and is always a joy to have conversation with her during the process. Another thing I enjoy Ejean is the old school Master Q comic, it just relive my childhood days haha",

Decided to pay the place a visit and had my hair cut with Grey herself, and I never once regretted it. She is professional, amicable and sincere. On top of that, her techniques are superb and I love how my hair turned out everytime under her hands. You can expect tons of joy and laughter during the process too. Totally enjoyed my time and highly recommend anyone new to try her out!",
