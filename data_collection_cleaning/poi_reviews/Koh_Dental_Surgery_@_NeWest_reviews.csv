Liu Zhi Yun,5,"Dr Sven is very patient in answering my questions and thoroughly explained all the details I needed to know to make an informed decision on how early I should proceed with my wisdom tooth removal as I will soon be overseas for a month. Uses simple terms for me to better understand my condition. Gave me a lot of good advice to help me manage my problem in the meantime and checked on the condition of my teeth. Provided patient-centred care and even asked about my clicking jaw problem despite it being >8 months ago (and was seen by another doctor in this clinic).

The dental assistant was also very polite and nice =) Counter staff are friendly as usual too! Really love the hospitality since my first visit in Oct 2022.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112045862873015925334/reviews
Vivien Cheong,5,"Has been a regular at the clinic under care of Dr Chris Tan. He is patient & always on hand to explain treatment plan & steps during treatment to allay my phobia. 2 weeks ago, had a toothache n went down to seek treatment, Dr Chris Tan was not in office but the service staff went out of the way to squeeze in an appointment to see Dr Khor who resolved my issue.  I am satisfied with the dentists' professionalism & the service provided by the staff.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104613018166617852052/reviews

Jojo U,5,Dr Mitchelle Ting is our family dentist for over two years. He is kind and professional. He pays attention to details and gently spoken. My boys feel comfortable with him.

Kenny Wong,1,"I was expecting a response from the clinic yesterday but did not receive any.

I am a regular patient of the dental clinic due to its proximity to my home, routinely scheduling my scaling and polishing sessions there. The previous doctors who attended to me before these recent sessions were excellent, and their high standards were evident. Unfortunately, the last two sessions have been unsatisfactory and left me deeply disappointed. The most recent session occurred last Saturday with a different doctor. The session was unusually brief, and when I inquired about why the front side of my teeth was not cleaned, I did not receive a response. Using the mirror provided, it initially appeared that the work had been done adequately.

However, on my way home, I used a personal mirror and noticed debris still left on my gums. I returned to the clinic to report this issue at the reception, hoping to have it rectified. The receptionist responded in a dismissive manner, which added to my frustration. The doctor, in the presence of other waiting patients, asserted that the front of my teeth had been cleaned and polished. This false claim and display of unprofessionalism were infuriating. The fall in standards is obvious compared to the excellent service I received previously.

Although I was invited to have my teeth checked and cleaned again, I am not inclined to return under these circumstances. I have since provided a photograph taken immediately after the session to document the issue.

As a loyal customer, I must say that the service standards at this clinic have significantly declined. Please consider this carefully before choosing this clinic.

1/8/24 Update:

I took time out of my busy schedule to visit the clinic today due to the misinformation provided in the reply, which is a form of defamation. Firstly, you falsely accused me of creating a scene when I did not, and secondly, I definitely did not threaten to write negative reviews on Google if no refund was given.

The incident occurred on Saturday. I was informed that a reply would be given on Monday. I waited until Tuesday, but no reply was provided. That’s when I decided to post a review on Google to ensure no other customers would be subjected to such an unpleasant experience.

Additionally, on Saturday, after I provided my feedback, the staff’s attitude was cold, insincere, and dismissive. Other customers were in close proximity when I asked the female dentist if she had thoroughly cleaned the front section of my teeth, despite the obvious stains and tartar present. She falsely claimed that she had, lying to save face in front of other customers. Despite maintaining my composure throughout and leaving the clinic when I could not receive a satisfactory reply, I was accused of creating a scene.

I was ready to leave this unpleasant incident behind, but the clinic’s reply not only attempted to push the blame onto me but also defamed me by accusing me of creating a scene.

When I visited the clinic today to clarify the false accusation, the male senior director sincerely apologized. He admitted that the female dentist did not perform a satisfactory job and acknowledged that the team did not manage the situation properly, wording used in the reply is not accurate and that it was wrong to accuse customers inappropriately. I was touched and considered giving them another chance. However, the attitude shown during my visit was not reflected in the written reply. This two-faced approach is absolutely appalling and insincere. The reply shows they are not sorry for their mistake. The dentist, instead of admitting her lack of professionalism and skill, is trying to push the fault onto the consumer, who in this case is the victim.

Please provide a truthful reply instead of one that simply tries to save face and demonstrates a complete lack of sincerity.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101675512609057986602/reviews
