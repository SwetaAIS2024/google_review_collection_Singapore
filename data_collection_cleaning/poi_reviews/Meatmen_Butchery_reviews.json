When I explained politely that I cannot accept it,  Chinese lady staff at the till squeezed the meat back into the desired thickness and tada! I donâ€™t know to laugh or cry!\n\nPerhaps it is better to visit other outlets\n\nEdit: The owner reached out offering a refund which I have politely declined because I am so happy to support this business.",

The cashier saw me in a hijab but never stop me or say anything. I buy 2 cut and ate one already then found out the other one is pork. There was also no receipt given so I check one of the meat we ate was pork. It is a little upsetting. Maybe separate the halal meat or put picture to show that is halal.",

They also make their own seasoning which has been a great match for our BBQs we have been doing. It's pretty much our go-to place such that I don't really bother with Cold Storage anymore. Affordability and quality in one place! Oh, and did I say service is good too? ðŸ˜Š",

The male staff who appeared to be staff/manager is very helpful recommending things to us. However, the female cashier would be better off giving us a less standoffish attitude throughout the shopping experience.",
