Sean,4,"First time patronising this food court run by food paradise inside safra mount Faber.  The china lady of SWK noodle was friendly.  Even though once again, I ran into issues with Safra discount and e voucher but she maintained friendly.  I ordered pig trotter rice and lady asked me to get the set including dumplings at 8 SGD as at 10 Aug 2024 Overall I enjoyed the meal.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117168273624339544276/reviews
