I was like, what??\n\nAnd I sarcastically told him, \"wow! A plain kway teow goreng with a sunny side up costs $5??\"\n\nHe just looked away looking guilty!\n\nOther indian Muslim stalls which I ordered the same thing costs between $3.50 - $4 which most of the time costs $4 but for $5 is a rip off!\n\nI'd suggest to you guys by asking him how much is the price first before placing an order.",
