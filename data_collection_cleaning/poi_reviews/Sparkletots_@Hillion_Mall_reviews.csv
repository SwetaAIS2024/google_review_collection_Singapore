Nefta Chan,5,"My eldest attended this childcare from 6mo till 6yo, my second from 3mo to 4.5mo. Would not have left if I had not moved house.
I can say this is one of the best childcare due to the space and the orderliness the staff, programmes and support. Ms Majorie and her principals have been extremely supportive, showing that they are hands on together with the teachers and educarers, regardless of levels (infant to K2). Admin and support staff are super warm. Teachers are great as well.
This childcare scores on all fronts in terms of quality care, convenient location and great support staff.
Your child will be in good hands.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111990492699274540079/reviews
