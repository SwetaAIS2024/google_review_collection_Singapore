Scarlett Supermarket @ Bugis+ (思家客武吉士店) Review

Located on the second floor of Bugis+, Scarlett Supermarket offers a wide range of Chinese snacks, beverages, and instant meals. It’s a go-to spot for anyone looking to stock up on unique Chinese products you might not easily find elsewhere in Singapore.

What’s Good:

Huge variety: From popular spicy hotpot bases and instant noodles to trending snacks like Lay’s localized flavors and White Rabbit candies, the selection is impressive.

Affordable pricing: Prices are generally reasonable, and there are often promotions or bundle deals.

Convenient location: Right in the heart of Bugis, it’s super accessible.

Clean and well-organized: The store layout makes browsing enjoyable even when it’s a bit crowded.

What Could Be Better:

Crowded during peak hours: Especially on weekends, it can feel a bit cramped.

Limited fresh items: It’s mostly packaged goods—don’t expect fresh produce or cooked meals here.

Some items lack English labels: Might be tough for non-Mandarin speakers to figure out what certain things are.

Verdict:
A fun and vibrant place to explore Chinese snacks and pantry staples. Great for both nostalgic shoppers and curious snackers. Worth a visit if you're in Bugis and want something a bit different from your usual supermarket run.

Lucas Lim,3,"Good deals at the supermarket. Can't say the same about the fast food inside though.. I think coming here for the supermarket only would be better.

Eating area is quite bad, not cleaned. Still, the food is decent for decent price but I would rather pay for a McSpicy meal if eat-in. Maybe it would be OK if you're just ordering takeaway.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104309529724851729421/reviews
