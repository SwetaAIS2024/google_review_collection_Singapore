Sheâ€™s super meticulous and really knows what sheâ€™s doing. Her facials are always such a treat; the massage she gives is so soothing and therapeutic, I always walk out feeling relaxed and looking refreshed. My skin literally glows after each session. I genuinely enjoy every appointment with her. Sheâ€™s a big reason I keep coming back!",

      "text": "Leaving this review for Dr Eileen Lew whom I have been a patient of over the past ten years (and counting). Dr Lew is one of the rare few doctors Iâ€™ve ever come across personally who has an amazing and pleasant personalityðŸ’¯- humble, patient, empathetic and kind, while being professional and dedicated at her work. I believe all her patients would feel the same way as she treats people around her with gentleness and respect, visible in her words and actionsðŸ™‚. Truly appreciate doctors like her (and her friendly clinic assistants) who are purely the reason why I look forward to my appointments each time - other than the results following treatment.\n\nThank you Dr Lew!",

      "text": "Love Dr Eileen Lew. She treats me like a friend and always willing to share her knowledge on skin care. When speaking with her, you will be able to feel her thoughfulness and sincerity. Given her cheerful attitude, it is also a joy to talk to her and its never a dull or strict moment. I am someone who is very particular about the doctors i visit, and if he/she is not up to my standard, i would never continue after the first session. As I have been with Dr Eileen for close to 2 years since she was at her own practice, that goes to show that she is the perfect skin care doctor in town! Also, there is definitely ZERO hard selling on her products and services!",
