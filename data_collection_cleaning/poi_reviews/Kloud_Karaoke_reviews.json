Nice setup and easy to use web based app.  The only 2 down sides of this place other than the seriously overpriced drinks are that it has no bathroom of it's own which means you need to go out into the mall, and the rooms are not soundproof meaning you can easily be impacted by the noise from your neighbor's",
