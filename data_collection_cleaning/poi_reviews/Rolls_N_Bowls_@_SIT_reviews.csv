Larktiss,4,"The Spicy Mayo Tuna Roll ($5) is a little bundle of joy wrapped in seaweed!  Each bite is a perfect harmony of flavors, with creamy tuna mayo, sweet corn, and crunchy carrot snuggled inside soft Japanese rice.  The sign proudly lists its ingredients, but one taste is all you need to know â€” this roll is a winner!  Simple, satisfying, and oh-so-addictive!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108335162839219606692/reviews
