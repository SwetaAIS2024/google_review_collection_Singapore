My polishing was done meticulously and made for a pleasant, comfortable experience. I have been keen to have my teeth whitened and finally got it done after Dr Amanda's efforts in concisely explaining the process and benefits of clinic vs home whitening. The OPG XR was also obtained very quickly during the consult, which allowed me to get on with my day asap. An excellent experience altogether thanks to the wonderful staff!",
