Leah Loy,5,"Happy to discover and finally visit this beautiful park. My boy, along with our friends, totally had great fun . After running around on their playground and playing at the sand area spot they can definitely refresh on the water park which is beautifully designed for little ones. How Iâ€™m always thankful in Singapore to offer this for free for everyone. Loved the neighborhood as well, residents are helpful to guide you to turn on the water features. And thanks to all the staff, keep the place tidy and safe for the family. They have good parking areas, we visit on weekdays so we donâ€™t have a hard time parking but I guess this is a popular place on weekends ðŸ˜Š so, better plan ahead for a complete great experience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116635677251612577151/reviews

S M,1,"Itâ€™s Friday, sept school holidays. Children are looking forward to playing. Waterplay is closed today at 8.15am. And not maintained. Algae seen. 9.19am the waterplay is now opened suddenly.

We also pressed the switched many times but it didnâ€™t work and no water came out. So the kids thought that it was under some maintenance.

The opening hours are not true to what is stated on Google
Management Please change the opening hours to state the exact timing. Children are here and are waiting. Some get disappointed and thought it was closed. Those came at 8am May have left by now. Please be considerate and put the true opening and closing hours.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114470665135003691785/reviews
