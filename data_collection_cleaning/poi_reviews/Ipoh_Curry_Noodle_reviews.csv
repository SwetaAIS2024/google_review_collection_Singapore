Lulu Joys (Lu),3,"Was looking for Curry Chee Cheong Fun in the area and found this place.
Inside Koufu foodcourt.
I had curry Chee cheong fun with roast meat ($5)

Taste wise, soso only.
Roast meat is ok.
Curry not hot.
Portion is good for a afternoon snack.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100398359671048900795/reviews
