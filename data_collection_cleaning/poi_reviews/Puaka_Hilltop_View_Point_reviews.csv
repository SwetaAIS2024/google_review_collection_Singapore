Amandine Honvault,5,The best view point of Pulau Ubin! Itâ€™s less than 10 min walk to reach the hill and totally worth it - can just park your bike at the entrance,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108608743262388392733/reviews
Leonard,5,"Without a doubt my favorite part of the park aside from the tower in the wetlands and the Fruit Orchid. Stunning views, especially on the right day.

It's a bit of an incline/steep to get up, but so worth it!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114943617353154122859/reviews
punyshark,5,"Great place to train and torture yourself. You will be rewarded by a relatively 10 minute short hill climb with steep, muddy and rocky terrains here. The final view at the summit however is super beautiful! Highly recommended to come try this climb if you are in Ubin!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101852695494997424451/reviews
kapila jayawardana,4,"There's a fence for you safety so you can't take the full advantage of the view. Chill bit cool place
Not much of a hike TBH only will took around 15 to 20 min to the top. The path is clear You can't get lost.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827643981218591800/reviews
Kevin M,4,"Nice view...not overly impressive. Bit of a steep walk up, but not too long. There is 2 view point areas, but there is some trees in the way and fences to prevent you from getting too close to edges. Worth the walk up, but don't set expectations too high.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106594784695526480551/reviews
