We were only in the shop for less than 5 minutes when he snatched the strawberries from us and told us to \"go outside\".",

      "text": "Don't understand some of the hate towards this store. This Korean shop sells soju & noodles & chips at reasonable prices, and sells certain noodle brands which you can never buy from NTUC/Fairprice/Giant etc. Yes, some of the stuffs here may be more costly as compared to NTUC/Fairprice/Giant. Then just don't buy those stuffs from here? Don't see the point of some people giving 2/3 stars because of those reasons. Personally, this is a go-to place to purchase Korean products, especially soju & noodles",

We were just finding something we wanted to buy, we didn't do any iligal thing, and we didn't say anything bad about the shop and the shop owner himself. I still can't forgive the way he treated us. I didn't ask for good customer service, but forcing customers to get out from the shop out of no where like this is too much.\n\nI will never come back to this shop.",
