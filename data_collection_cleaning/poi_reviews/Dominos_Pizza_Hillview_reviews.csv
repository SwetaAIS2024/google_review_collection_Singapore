ëŠ˜ì§€ê¸ˆì²˜ëŸ¼,1,"I just don't understand why they never pick the phone? I ordered pizza from official website, waited 2 hours without any notice. I had no option to even cancel the order on the website, the store never answered the phone. Only thing I could do is just waiting, reading reviews here and got angry..
Why do you run business like this? Pick up the phone or simple text for lateness would be fine.
By the way, our pizza was so cold that we had to heat up in the oven... I don't know how long those set on your counter until it got finally picked up..",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111095934341562348718/reviews
Mister T,1,"This outlet truly deserves the 2.7* average that it has. Staff were friendly and polite but that's where the good ends. Pizza was prepared in an extremely shoddy manner, undersized(closer to 6"" personal than 9"" regular that I ordered) and odd shaped with toppings sparsely added and just thrown into the middle. Submitting feedback to Dominos via their website feedback was a waste of time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107645426638611659568/reviews
Cheryl Yeow,1,"Both shawahma xl size had super little meat and one of them had very little cheese. We had the L shawahma yesterday and it had way more meat than this! The classified chicken was also not cut properly. Called the shop multiple times, no answer",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111177858239463347132/reviews
Mirza Adam,5,"Good Malaysian stuff for working eventhough lack of manpower and high demand order.

HR better sort this out and get more workers. 1 chef, 1 cashier handling overwhelming orders during peak hour. 1 chef making 1 pizza per minute can you imagine how this company is exploiting 3rd world manpower. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž disappointed in the management, better give them a good bonus.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115126345629567882964/reviews
noris,1,"Regretted trying the double cheeseburger pizza. Toppings are meagre - looks like they cut up one burger patty for a regular size pizza. And the stuffed crust has equally little burger patty filling if at all. Overall it feels like eating pizza dough with pickles & cheeseburger sauce. Crispy fries are soft . Such a let-down. I would have given zero stars for food if I could. Stick to regular flavours, people",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115282337368333885591/reviews
