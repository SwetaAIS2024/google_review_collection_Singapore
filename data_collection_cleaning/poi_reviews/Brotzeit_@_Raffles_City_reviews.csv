Faith,5,"Super awesome place! Really amazing decor, comfortable chairs and environment and the staff were super friendly and nice.

The food was superb too. Worth every penny. Not someone who will often try German food but this was a pleasant experience. I enjoyed everything that is to offer and everything was seasoned so well! I‚Äôm not a mash potatoes person but the potatoes from the chicken cutlet meal was great

Overall a nice place to have a good lunch, and would love to see what is there to offer for other platters in the future",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116899979553818556489/reviews
Yen Trinh,5,"If you're carnivorous, this is the place to be. Even better if you go as a group! Great vibes. Love all of their platters, sausages, bread baskets. I'm not too impressed with their non-beer beverage, but hey you're here for a different reason. Staff is prompt even during busy periods! I'll definitely be back if I need some bloody protein again",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106124579273314676288/reviews

Barry Heng,5,"[11052025]
1st trip to Brotzeit. My son had wanted to try Brotzeit after his friend recommended to him. So the family decided to have Mother's Day dinner there.
There are indoor and outdoor areas.

We ordered Brotzeit signature platter, 2 pints of beers and 2 bottles of cider.
The platter is enough for 4 - 6 pax.

The pork ribs was tender. The pork knuckle skin is crispy.
The side dishes made the meats more complete.
My family really enjoyed the food. The stomachs were totally ""satisfied"".

Note: do make advance reservation if you want indoor seats.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112889696181387675188/reviews
Roland Chui,5,"Brotzeit springtime dishes is a culinary delight. Spargel was perfectly cooked - tender, yet crisp, slughtly sweet n silky texture with hollandaise. Pork knuckle crispy skin with the flesh still moist n tender. Apricot cheese kuchen is delicious - must try again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116500917915412811761/reviews
