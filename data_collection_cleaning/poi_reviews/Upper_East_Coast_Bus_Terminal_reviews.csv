Irfan Maliq,2,"Normal bus terminal, very small and basic. Nothing much at the bus terminal, except for the part where the cafe was closed, and looking abandoned. Unsure if it was defunct or abandoned, but I hope that the cafe will be opened in the near future. Most bus services there goes to the North Central region such as 25, 45, 13 and 55.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115129371211029342618/reviews
Aravindhan Ravikumar,5,"Opened on 9 December 2001 following the closure of Marine Parade Bus Terminal earlier on 16 September that year, this bus terminal has a single vehicular concourse area, with a combined entrance and exit leading to Upper East Coast Road. The terminal building combines passenger alighting berths and waiting areas with an interchange office, driver‚Äôs lounge and toilets. A bus park in the middle of the terminal allows for the layover of buses, and an expansion to the original bus park was completed in January 2017. It had initially absorbed Service 13 and 853# (now 853M) from the former Marine Parade Bus Terminal, while the remaining five services (16, 55, 76, 135, 155) had continued to loop at Siglap Link. Commuter facilities at the terminal were constructed later and opened on 4 August 2002 for the benefit of residents and Bedok Camp personnel. This bus terminal was originally built with metal queuing berths similar to those used at bus interchanges, they were troublesome for commuter boarding and unnecessary for a bus terminal with low human traffic. The metal queuing berths have since been removed and replaced with concrete benches. Bollards have also been installed at the kerb edge. The bus terminal later added bus services 43, 45, 48 and 506 (extended from Bedok Bus Interchange) between July 2005 and December 2006 but service 48 had been amended to Bedok North Bus Depot in December 2011. Services 46 and 137 were introduced in June 2016 and October 2017 respectively from this bus terminal and services 25 and 55 were extended from Bedok Bus Interchange and Siglap Road respectively in April 2017. However, in December 2021, express bus service 506 had been shortened to Serangoon Bus Interchange as part of the Downtown Line Stage 3 Bus Rationalisation. This bus terminal is operated by SBS Transit and is located near the upcoming Bedok South MRT station on the fifth stage of the Thomson-East Coast line.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106935057144500350420/reviews
Adi Soon,1,"You only come here if you've fallen asleep on the bus or to the lost and found to retrieve something. If the first, then take a cab home. If the second, likely you will find that there is no one in an office that is supposed to be open. The person working there is just hiding in a corner. Knock the door loudly and make alot of noise or get one of the people outside who work there to help you get the person's attention.

Sometimes people don't know what working means.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100839246026451360857/reviews
