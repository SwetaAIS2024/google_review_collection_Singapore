The moment we stepped inside, we were transported to a Peranakan paradise! The space is clean, cozy, and comfortable, making it a truly inviting place to relax and enjoy a delicious meal.\n\nOur friendly waiter recommended some of their most popular dishes, and we were blown away by the flavors!  Highlights included the rich and savory Buah Keluak Chicken, the comforting Fish Maw Soup, and the crispy Ngoh Hiang. The Seafood Fried Mee Sua and Tahu Telur were also standouts.  We ended our meal with a refreshing Honey Osmanthus dessert, the perfect sweet finish.\n\nThe service was excellent, with our waiter making sure we had a great dining experience. We highly recommend Bumbu Restaurant for an authentic and delicious Peranakan dining experience in Singapore!",

      "text": "Nice cosy space for a very intimate dining experience. The place is well decorated with posters and items from the 70/80s. The food is very reasonable for it's price point. The restaurant has a large menu, so we didn't manage to try everything. From what we had, the beef rendang is a top recommendation and a must try! The black squid was a surprise, and is something different from your regular squid dish. A must, open their prawn crackers! Fluffy, crunchy, and light, it was a delight to have. Food was served promptly, and we had a good experience.",
