Vijay Sarathy,2,The problem s the staff. We asked to warm the cookies and serve us. The worker refused telling that it won't taste good. It tasted bad in normal temperature. We took it home and ate after heating. Tasted very good,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117702716930658423471/reviews
Ray T,3,"Went there to buy ice cream at around 820pm or so coz my boy wanted it.

Counter was not manned and this lady came over after a while and was not very welcoming, till I had to ask if they were closing (apparently closing time is 930pm after checking online thereafter).

She just glumly said “No” and proceeded to take the order and scooped the ice cream. After scanning to pay, without even waiting a while to confirm payment, she just walked away with the terminal machine.

Erm… This location, RWS not only represent your own branding but also SG as a whole for tourists. And the staff literally had zero customers to serve at all 3 counters. Might really need to consider the training for such staff.

Ice cream was nice though.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103845189349994947925/reviews
A. K.,5,"Not sure why there were bad reviews, maybe we were lucky to get a good server. He was very friendly and was generous in his ice cream scooping. The hokkaido milk chocolate and salted caramel ice cream were both delicious!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100280886063789061577/reviews

N. A.,5,"I’ve tried from the cabana, pool bed, beach bed. Service is great, food and drinks is worth the price, can we have the music as good as the other beach clubs in sentosa?
