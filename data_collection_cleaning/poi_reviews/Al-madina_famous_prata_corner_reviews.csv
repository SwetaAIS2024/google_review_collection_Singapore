William Chong,1,"Specifically asked for fried chicken not to be chopped and served at full piece, reason being sometimes I know when it's chopped they might not give the whole piece. As you can see, all I had was chicken bones with pathetic amount of meats attached to the bones, the maggi goreng was also too salty, I just couldn't finish it (wouldn't wanna get kidney stones).

And have I mentioned? This plate of ""things"" cost $7.50?!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112770222882871084448/reviews
kY Ping,3,The prata quite tasty actually but the chicken mutabak not to our liking. I think for hygiene wise a lot to improve. I saw staff after handling cash use the same hand without glove to handle prata preparation. This standard cannot be acceptable.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100426672373589567762/reviews
