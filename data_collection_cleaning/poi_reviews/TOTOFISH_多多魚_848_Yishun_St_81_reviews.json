Fish head is half whereas fish tail (top up $1 only) is the whole piece with both sides. I find the menu value for money and hence price v competitvely wrt sliced fish soup. Quantity is sufficient for big eater like myself to be full....so i think they are quite generous. Maybe bec this store is newly opened....collection is chaotic man. Sigh...Still i would highly recommended it",

      "text": "While passing through this area for an errand, I figured I might as well grab lunch nearby. That’s when I stumbled upon the newly opened TOTO Fish at Blk 848. I had tried it once before in Woodlands.\n\nLast time, I ordered the steamed seabass with soy bean sauce set meal. This time, I went for the chopped chillies set meal—a perfect choice for fish and spice lovers. As always, the stall maintained an impressive standard of freshness. The steamed fish was tender, and there was no unpleasant fishy smell, which is a testament to its quality.\n\nWhile enjoying my meal, a few curious people stopped by to ask about the stall. I gladly recommended it, especially to those in the area. Some might find seabass a bit pricey compared to buying it at the market, but looking at it from another perspective—paying a little more saves the hassle of cooking at home, especially when dining alone. Considering the cost of ingredients, preparation, and cleanup, ordering here is actually more convenient and cost-effective.\n\nI really hope they open a stall near my neighborhood soon!",

      "text": "Tucked away in Khatib Central, Totofish is a fresh addition to the neighborhood’s food scene, specializing in steamed fish with an impressive range of flavors. Diners can choose from three styles—Cantonese, black bean, or chili—making it versatile enough to suit varied taste buds.\n\nThe Cantonese sauce? It’s a standout—a harmonious blend that’s rich yet not overpowering, complementing the delicate fish flavor beautifully.\n\nThe set meal thoughtfully includes white rice and a silky steamed egg, adding layers of comfort and balance to the dish. It's the kind of meal that feels like a warm, home-cooked hug.\n\nWith its affordable offerings and focus on quality, Totofish is carving out its space as a go-to spot for steamed fish lovers. There’s also options to add on prawns of lala if you like.",
