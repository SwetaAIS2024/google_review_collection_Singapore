qingxian qiu,2,Used to be one of the better chicken rice. I’m not a chicken rice fan but this stall changed me. But things have changed after the young assistant takes helm about weeks ago. It used to be helmed by an uncle. The rice now is no longer fluffy. Chicken no longer tender. Chilli is abit inconsistent and sometime spicy and less tangy. Hopefully owner can look to retrain and restore standard. Otherwise now it is just a “normal” chicken rice,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110218215668875336608/reviews
