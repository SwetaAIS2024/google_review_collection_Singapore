James Okpun,5,"Honestly, REALLY a Superb tasty curry chicken with rice. Merry Haus have a indoor with air conditioning playground too. Best meeting place with nice coffee! Kids love it too.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115621865595633428500/reviews
t c,1,Poorly maintained playground that is ridiculously expensive for its size and quality. All the toys were broken and not properly sorted. I doubt the owner even clean the toys. The owner also doesnt let parents sit down even after you pay for the playground unless you order food and drinks. Super stingy. Wont come again,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101688820356272715528/reviews
Erica Ching,1,"We didnt manage to eat the food here... but we paid to enter the playground for an hour..
After 30mins, i asked if I could just put my younger one in for 30mins so that I could check them out at the same time... unfortunately couldnt.. for that I can understand... but somehow the next minute she ""chase"" us out by saying only dine in can sit on the table..so we have to leave the restaurant and stand outside and wait for my kid

Aside from the bad experiences,  I find the environment for the playground can be better... toys are everywhere without organising...walking space for kids are very limited... can be a tripping hazards..",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116759925584723432976/reviews
