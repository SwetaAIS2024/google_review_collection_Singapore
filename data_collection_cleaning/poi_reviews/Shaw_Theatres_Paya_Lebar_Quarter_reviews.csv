oXRYSTALo Ong,3,"Shaw Theatres Paya Lebar Quarter IMAX: Big Screen, Big Price (3/5 Stars)

Rating Breakdown:

• Ambiance: 4/5 (Modern and clean, good sound system, large screen)

• Seating: 3/5 (Decent, but not as comfortable as Gold Class or other IMAX theaters)

• Value for Money: 2/5 (Price is too high for the experience, could go to Gold Class for a better experience)

Overall: 3/5

Donkey and I decided to cycle for a movie at Paya Lebar Quarter after we had dinner at Kent Ridge. We wanted to catch the 8:20 pm show at Golden Village in Paya Lebar Square, but we didn't make it in time. So we opted for the 9 pm show at Shaw Theatres Paya Lebar Quarter instead.

Unfortunately, when we arrived, there weren't any other slots available for the movie we wanted to watch. Donkey was really keen on seeing it, and Shaw Theatres only had the IMAX option at 9 pm. We decided to go for it, but the price of the IMAX ticket was $25 per person, which added up to $50 for both of us. Donkey and I felt that it was a bit expensive.

We didn't feel like the IMAX experience was worth the extra cost. The seating was decent but not the most comfortable compared to Gold Class. While the screen was bigger, it wasn't a drastic difference. For that price, we could have gone to a Gold Class cinema instead and had a more comfortable experience.  The seating was similar to the regular theatres. The armrest couldn't be lifted, which you can do with the couple seats.

Overall, it was a decent experience, but we wouldn't recommend paying extra for the IMAX here unless you're a huge IMAX fan. The sound system was good, and the screen was big.  It's definitely a great location with modern technology, but the price point is a bit steep for what you get.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews

Jer Chun,2,"One day went to Shaw @ PLQ to watch a movie. I ask the staff if they accept Capital vouchers, after checking with his manager (a lady), the manager came over and told me Yes they do. I started with payment  using the Capital apps and after a few failed attempts, I then realised the terminal shows Landlease which means they only accept Landlease vouchers not Capital. The manager showed a face of unhappiness and just walked away to her office. I continued to make payments with credit card assisted by the staff.
What kind of attitude and service was this by the manager?? No apologies? Is that my fault?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100343617026866128217/reviews
