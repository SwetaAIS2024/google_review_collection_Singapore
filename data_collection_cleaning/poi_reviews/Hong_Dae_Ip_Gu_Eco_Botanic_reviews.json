      "text": "Had our second visit to Hongdae Korean BBQ and it definitely won’t be our last! We ordered the 2-pax Set 5, which was more than enough food — generous portions and great value. The banchan (side dishes) were all delicious and refillable, which is always a plus at a Korean BBQ spot.\n\nService was excellent — for a small fee (around RM10), the staff grilled the pork for us to perfection. Everything was cooked just right, letting us enjoy the meal without the stress of grilling ourselves.\n\nGreat food, solid service, and a chill atmosphere. Highly recommend for anyone craving authentic Korean BBQ in Johor!",

      "text": "Tried the set A and add on boneless beef briskets.\nBeef briskets are sweet base marinated. Good to go for a few bites, gets too heavy afterwards. The beef quality is good, tender and juicy.\nPork belly slices are quite oily with heavy pork taste.\nThe set comes with steamed eggs and the seafood soup. Seafood soup with good portioning of the egg tofu.\nThe floor is very oily, slippery.\nWill not go again.",

      "text": "My hubby dislike Korean BBQ because he felt he wasn't having a good eating while having to grill meat. He also dislike the smoke and smell from bbq. However Hong Dae Ip offers the perfect solution for all of us (kids and adults) because you still can have the korean BBQ and they are cooked on separately by the staff and bring to your table. Hence the whole restaurant dont smell and is not smoky at all!\n\nThe banchan are nice and they refill them when we need it.\n\nThey have bbq set meals, ala bbq meat, pancakes and stew. The staff are well trained and there is a Indian manager (I assume) to make sure operations run smooth.\n\nI was cold from the air con (with fan attached) but they promptly adjusted it.\n\nI called the WhatsApp number to book a table and it was also promptly answered.\n\nLove the experience and would definitely visit again.",

The side dishes were plentiful and delicious, and the service was warm, attentive, and very kind. We also enjoyed some classic Korean “so-maek” (soju + beer), which completed the experience. The atmosphere was lively yet cozy — perfect for both families and friends.\nHighly recommend this place if you’re craving authentic Korean BBQ in Johor Bahru!",
