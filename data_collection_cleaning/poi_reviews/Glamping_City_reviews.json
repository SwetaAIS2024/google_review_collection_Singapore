      "text": "Location they provide is far from any public transport. We booked 4 hours tent, it really is not that dreamy as it looks. Dirty dusty tent and mats. The fan they gave were not efficient at all. We had to stay outside only for air. Lights were so low that dinner as well was not visible inside the tent. They provided nice cutlery though, we had to sit outside on the concrete benches as it was really hot inside. East coast park gets the credit of its own beauty. You can enjoy it by bringing your own stuff. Its better to set your own tent. They take $50 deposit. It is mention that they give back in 3-5 days. Which they took more than 10 days to return, even after everyday asking. Giving 2 stars only for the quick responses.",

I requested for a birthday banner and it is simple yet nice. Loved the rustic touch! However an area i feel could be improved is the placing of the bed and table. It’s a little weird but no complaints, still loved it overall.",

I want people to know this and not go for this place. They asked if they give us one more extra battery, we will leave good reviews. We did not accept. So don’t be fooled by seemingly good reviews here. This place does not deserve the price we have paid for at all. We tried to communicate the issue next morning but never heard back.",
