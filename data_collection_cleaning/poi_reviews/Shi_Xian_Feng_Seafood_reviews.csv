Average Guy,4,"Had dinner there. A party of 6 pax and spent about $130. We ordered the claypot fish soup (which was the bill of the cost), marmite venison, pork ribs, mixed vegetables, san loh hor fun. Quality of the dishes were good and I think the quite innovative … marmite venison??!! Interesting.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104774652379260574924/reviews

Corissa Chee,2,"Very shocked at how small and little the portion is given the price at $7. When I can get better, bigger portion and maybe even with an egg at other places.
Unhappy with the portion x price.
Taste wise is not bad.
But, sorry not sorry, too disappointed to go back again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114725228324243685520/reviews
