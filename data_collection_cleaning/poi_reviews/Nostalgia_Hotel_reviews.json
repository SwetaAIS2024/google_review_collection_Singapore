One of the best features is probably its prime location, just a stone's throw away from Tiong Bahru Market which quickly became our favorite spot for this trip :) Transportation is similarly a breeze with its nearby bus stops and train station. We'd love to be back should we find ourselves visiting Singapore again :)",

      "text": "I had an amazing stay at Nostalgia Hotel in Tiong Bahru! The location is perfect—just a short walk to fantastic cafes, hawker centers, and public transport, making it easy to explore Singapore. The staff was incredibly warm and welcoming, always going the extra mile to ensure a comfortable stay.\n\nThe hotel's classic and elegant vibe added a unique charm, blending heritage with modern comforts. The rooms were cozy, clean, and well-equipped. A wonderful bonus was the free coffee machine, which made excellent espresso, lattes, and hot chocolate—perfect for a quick pick-me-up any time of the day.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a boutique hotel with excellent hospitality, convenience, and thoughtful amenities!",

      "text": "The best thing about the Nostalgia hotel is its location in a beautiful central district across the street from a popular hawker center (restaurant/food court), and nearby other great restaurants and stores. The hotel itself is clean and nice, perhaps a little pricey although I am not too familiar with Singapore standards. The room was quite small, but tidy and wholly adequate. Service was helpful and polite. Solid recommendation, altogether.",
