Orange,1,"The food was mediocre overall. I ordered the medium spicy fragrance but found it lacked any spice. The fish was overcooked, and the soup was undrinkable. While the portion sizes for add-on items were generous, the shredded potato was average, and the sliced pork with cucumber lacked flavor and impact.

The spinach was the only dish that stood out as decent. On a positive note, I enjoyed the jumbo lemon with plum drink—it came in a big cup, and the sweetness was perfectly balanced.

Overall, the experience was underwhelming, and I wouldn’t return.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
Shawn Dabi,2,"The spicy diced chicken was not crispy, the crab bee hoon is not fresh and too salty. One of the dishes was forgotten until reminded.

Looking forward to try again and change this to a 5 star review once things are resolved!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106232470726851561809/reviews
ronnie chan,5,"We ordered Charred Chilli Grilled Patin fish, it was absolutely delicious. The flesh was moist and tender with smoky charred flavour. We also added some side dishes to go with our dinner. Overall we enjoyed our dinner here, and not forgotten to mention that their services were excellent too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106831360238977482868/reviews
Tan ANGELA,5,Superb and delicious grilled fish in Singapore !!! Pickled cabbage flavour really amazed me. Tasty and savoury with the fresh fish. Coffee pork ribs and Chinese Spinach with Salted Eggs & Century Eggs both also delicious. Made us want to have more rice. Beverages also highly recommended for their Ice Lemon Water & Jumbo Handmade Pineapple Lemon Tea. Friendly staff and good ambience to have dinner here. Will come back again.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110813304246653788688/reviews
Houyhnhnm Unicorn,4,"The place is great. Service is good. The best dish I have is the white rice. The grilled fish looks repetitively grilled, lost any juiciness and tasted bitter. Only 3 stains of Dao-gay, negligible tofu and the stub of cabbage.

Quality of food has a lot of space for improvement.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102395615395541260174/reviews
