Michael Andrew Ferrer,5,The staff was very accommodating the first time I stepped into their shop. I got my first pair of glasses in their Bedok Mall branch but it is now closed so I went to their Parkway Parade branch to buy and replace my frame. They did an excellent job in re-fitting my existing lenses to the new frame. Recommended shop for your optical needs.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110449345059092648034/reviews
Kelvin Aw,1,"Just had an unpleasant experience with this shop. I have been coming here for many years but the service standards have deteriorated. Took a long time to get the glasses ready and they had miscommunications with their suppliers. Was informed by them that the glasses would be ready by yesterday and that I could collect today. Turned up with my aged parents and they said they were not ready. Essentially blamed it on their supplier without taking responsibility for their actions. There were other lapses that friends complained about. So thatâ€™s it, Emperor Optics have lost yet another customer. Simply bad optics. Pun intended.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106941987473302097099/reviews
Vinoth Kumar,5,"One of my favourite optical shop in Singapore and I am going to miss this very much as I have moved out of the country. They are not a huge store, but have the right collection that satisfies diverse group of people, flexible in many ways and are great in customer service. Keep up the great work guys!!!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100672463053417577392/reviews
Sentinel Lee,5,"Been with them for over 30+ years, including all my children eyecare needs. Their honesty, integrity, professionalism, experience, and patience were the hallmarks that make them standout among optician outlets. Our eyes are precious and I know my family is in safe hands under their care. Their staff, Robin, at the Parkway Parade outlet, is highly commended for representing all the positive attributes that make their service so outstanding.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104791311249237105973/reviews
Alwyn Tan,5,"Popped into this shop thinking I might want to get contact lenses. The man who attended to me offered to check my eyes and told me that I do not need to. He said that its better for me not to correct my eyesight at my age since i can see relatively well, in terms of reading and driving. I thought this is great service to benefit the consumer, without any charge. Highly recommend this optical shop for anyone.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112318627724963955898/reviews
