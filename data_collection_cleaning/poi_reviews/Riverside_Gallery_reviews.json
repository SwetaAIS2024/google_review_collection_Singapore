One huge panoramic view expand the heart and soul of the individual or together with the close friends or love one. It will quench one's desire and quieten the easily excitable heart so that the serenity of life will return. A place to keep still and introspect, look inward instead of outward. Here one find himself/herself. No longer lost nor wondering, remain rooted. Still and release all the self induced reality. See that there is nothing that can make one not happy. Happiness is always here, inside, inward, dwelling within.",
