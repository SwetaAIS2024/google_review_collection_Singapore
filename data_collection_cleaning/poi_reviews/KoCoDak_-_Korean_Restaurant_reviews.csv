Yekyek,5,"We tried the fried chicken and cold noodles, and both were excellent. The fried chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, while the cold noodles had a delightful QQ texture and a flavorful taste!

Definitely worth a visit!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105574589565051444871/reviews
Russell Yap,5,"The food was very good and authentic. The batter of the fried chicken is a bit different from what I am used to, but it is still nice and crispy for a wet batter. Noodles were delicious and chewy and full of flavour. Highly recommended to come here to get your Korean fix :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102996450001366495025/reviews
