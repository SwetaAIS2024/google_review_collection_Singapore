      "text": "Went there on 5 May 2025 along with 2 friends. Been closed off to the public 2 years ago but my friend insisted to go so we climbed the slope at the corner of the playground where the statue is. Relatively easy to climb up. Just don't hold anything while climbing. If you want to climb the slope you should be agile and not so heavy. Climb and use the trees and vines to pull yourself up. Shouldn't wear light coloured clothes. The dirt will make it dirty. There's a old prison there. Many gangs go there. People like to vandalise the area. Vandalisms there quite innapropriate. However, the place is relatively easy to go around. Staircase to second floor is a bit difficult to climb becauuse the 2 steps on top are broken off and the top 3rd is nearly broken off. the top has a nice view. Got people go there for birthday. Got people go there do black magic. You can go inside the prison. However, I do suggest bringing a bright torchlight as it is very dark there. Encountered a ghost as well. Should not go by restricted staircasee because many people die there. I suggest going by the slope. You will fall once or twice but scars aren't so serious. I suggest bringing a roll of bandage for it. Overall, it is a nice place.",

The structure itself is old and falling apart, so take caution when exploring (be it with your friends or a solo trip). There is a decenet view from the roof of the tower right next to the radar thing and its a pretty quaint spit to chill",
