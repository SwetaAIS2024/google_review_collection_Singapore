Amirul Asman,5,"This kind of place deserves our support big time. Bought their nasi padang, cost me $7.20. But a good portion was given.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112436119714930350087/reviews
eddy khoo,5,"My favourite go-to place to have nasi lemak in CCK.  The portions are super generous with the rice easily able to feed two hungry persons.  At at $4, it is an unbeatable price.  Hence the long morning and lunch queues.  I noticed that some have complained of the so-called 'bad' service here which I had never experienced.  I kinda think it's reciprocal.  If you're polite, they're polite too :)",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100216526729811832950/reviews

Ethen. TKW,1,"Food is ok. But the service from the skinny Malay auntie really cannot make it. The way she talk to customer is very attitude and a bit rude with her tone. Very impatient and lousy customer service. If I only I could rate lower than 1 star for the service, I will rate -1.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116740671537924310661/reviews
Janice Chew,1,"food was really good, unfortunately, their service throws me off. Ordered a few times but their pricing is inconsistent, they really do charge base on their own judgement. Was at the shop in the evening and wasnt sure if they closed, the lady just ignored me and when i walked away, she shouted at me asking what i want while giving a really dull face. It was not just one staff but most times visited with different staffs, they were impolite and disrespectful despite me being polite, which i hope to see an improvement. I would avoid purchasing mainly due to the terrible service.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115504590900230238569/reviews
