Shelley Ho,5,"I read many comments stating that the mala is not spicy, doesn’t have any mala taste. I am an avid mala fan so I went to try out of curiosity without any expectations.

The mala xiang guo is not your typical mala xiang guo BUT it is delicious. Not all mala tastes the same (think Gong Yuan Mala Tang and YGF). I would liken this to the healthier version as it is not overly oily and salty which i really like. I ordered medium spicy and it is less spicy than the typical medium spicy so you may want to go highest level if spicy is your thing. I finished up everything and you can see there’s not a layer of oil on the soup base. This is great for me as I’m on a low carb diet but still want to enjoy mala.

Price wise, it was shockingly good. This is the best value for money mala xiang guo I’ve ever had. I ordered 3 types of green leafy veg, asparagus, 3 types of mushrooms, black fungus, dory fish, quail eggs and it was only $12. Mind you, the lady boss was not stingy when she grabbed the ingredients for me. This is the only time I felt a mala stall owner is doing an honest business without ripping the customer off. My usual order would come up to at least $18 to over $20 typically.

The stall also sells handmade frozen dumplings (30 pcs for $30) so I ordered the XLB to try (if it’s good I’ll come back to get the frozen dumplings). The XLB is generous in size. Skin is rather thick (I’d prefer thinner skin) but it’s chewy - very much like the handmade dumplings my friend from China makes - very authentic. The soup within is lightly flavorful and tasty. Again not too overpowering kind of taste nor salty. I have to say the meat is very fine and soft. $5 for a basket I think is good value.

If you are looking for the typical oily, salty mala xiang guo then don’t come here.

I have saved this stall to return again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108859281135876340047/reviews

Benny,2,The spicy food advertised isn't spicy at all. Food is overpriced as well and the owner often pretend not to see customers while she was idling doing nothing.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115497492794858919513/reviews
