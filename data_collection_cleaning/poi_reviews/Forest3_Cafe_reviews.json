      "text": "I‚Äôm surprised their karaoke song selection has much more to choose than actual karaoke places! You get to sing for free when you order drinks but if you dare to in front of everyone in the public space üòÇ the wait for your turn can be long when the place gets crowded. But it‚Äôs interesting how despite this, it‚Äôs still good to chat around your table and you can still hear everyone easily; the music volume is set to perfect\n\nThere is also darts machine around! Which is fun to play and chill with friends.\n\nFood wise there isn‚Äôt anything special but just typical finger food. Price is average for bars.\n\nThe Sapporo beer is great though!\n\nThe staff are friendly and nice and quite attentive when it comes to passing the microphones and also changing the beer tower.\n\nA great place!",
