      "text": "Teo Heng is very \"family friendly\", and has one of the lowest prices in town. Outside food & drinks are allowed, as only limited soft drinks are for sale on-site for $1. The Centrepoint location is convenient. Rooms are a little small and not very fancy. The sound system and song selection are decent. I'd recommend them if you are just looking for a cheap, no-frills, fun time singing with friends!",

      "text": "Horrible customer service with poor business ethics. Spoke to 3 different staffs but only got the name of the last staff by the name of May.\n\nInitially told me they have small room from 5pm to 8pm and the minimum booking is 2 hours so I proceeded to book from 5pm to 7pm but they said I have to book till 8pm because it means no one will book the room from 7pm to 8pm. I told them I only need to book for 2 hours and I will fulfil the minimum 2 hours policy so why can’t I book from 5pm to 7pm.\n\nSo they are technically forcing me to book for 3 hours even though the company policy is 2 hours.\n\nIf they observe operational issues on their business processes then shouldn’t they refine and improvise instead of forcing it on their customers?",
