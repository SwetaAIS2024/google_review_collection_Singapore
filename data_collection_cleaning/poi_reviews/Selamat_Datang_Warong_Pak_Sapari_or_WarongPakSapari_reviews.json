The $4.50 serving with shredded chicken was simply delicious.\n\nI added chicken spare parts (gizzards) to my bowl - for additional $2. The innards were tender and chewy. Very good too.\n\nNo wonder there’s a rather long queue.",

The thick, luscious gravy, made from a blend of spices, potatoes, and dried shrimp, coats the noodles beautifully. Each bite is a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, making it an absolute must-try.\n\nThe stall's dedication to preserving traditional recipes is evident in every bowl they serve. The flavors are bold and authentic, and the generous portions ensure you'll leave with a satisfied belly. Warong Pak Sapari truly embodies the essence of Malay comfort food.",
