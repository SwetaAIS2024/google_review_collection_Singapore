I confirmed with the girl that I ordered 20 drinks ($15 per glass) only, but he counted it as 45 drinks on purpose ðŸ˜…\nSo the difference was $375 ðŸ™„\nEvery time I order, they ask for my signature, and at that time the quantity is correct, but at the end of the checkout, the quantity suddenly increases. All Japanese people, be careful!",
