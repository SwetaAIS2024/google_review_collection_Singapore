Genta,4,"National Stadium Metro provides convenient access to one of Singapore's most iconic landmarks, but it's not without its challenges, especially during peak hours or after shows and concerts.

As I made my way through the bustling station, I couldn't help but feel the energy and excitement that permeated the air, a testament to the stadium's status as a hub for entertainment and events. While the direct access to the stadium is a definite plus, the crowds can be overwhelming, requiring patience and careful navigation.

Despite the occasional congestion, National Stadium Metro remains a key transportation hub for visitors and locals alike, offering seamless connectivity to one of Singapore's premier destinations for sports and entertainment.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117016178934992842533/reviews
Seah Jia Hui,5,Very busy due to concerts and events but the staffs are very efficient in guiding the crowds. But still too crowded. Hope Korea wins ~~,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews
CK Tan,5,"This is the station where sports and mega events happen because the only Singapore big capacity indoor stadium is here. Although the Kallang Wave Mall is newer, the neighbouring Leisure Mall isn't too bad either. The Old Airport Road Food Centre might be a better place to settle your hunger. It's just 2 stops away using the train. Opened since early 70s with now more than 150 stalls, Old Airport Road Food Centre is one of the oldest and largest hawker centres in Singapore. These will be more than enough too conquer anyone's appetite. The prices won't hurt your pocket but you might have to resist eating more than you should.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102797007706981476316/reviews
Heng You Chan,5,"the architecture of this station is interesting, with the train platforms being very deep, some may feel claustrophobic when looking up",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103207671117328127109/reviews
Petri Riikonen,4,"Beautifully designed MRT station by the National Stadium. It only has 2 exits so itâ€™s really not that big. Sometimes you get stuck here involuntarily as the circle line sometimes forces you to alight the train here to wait for another one so you can continue your journey. Besides that, everything works well here.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112343668890188997814/reviews
