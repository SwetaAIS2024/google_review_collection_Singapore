This ruined the experience even though its a small amount, people bought snack for fun. What's fun is that when feeling cheated. Hope other customers become aware.",

She worked with such incredible speed, scanning and packing my groceries in a flash. Her proactive attitude, helpful nature, and efficiency impressed me. I truly hope her efforts are seen by her employer and recognized to be a valuable asset to the team.",
