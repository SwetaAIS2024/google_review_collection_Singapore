They advertise a deluxe set menu but there is no T&C stating it applies only for lunch, not dinner, on the printed menu.\n\nThere was no server at the front to address any customers despite it being a Thursday night, the restaurant was half empty, and us having a booking.\n\nIn the end, we had to order the buffet for 5 pax. It was good but we came here for the deluxe set initially, and we're slightly disappointed at being misled.\n\nThe male manager server had a dour look the whole time.",

The garlic rice was quite nice flavourful. Few things is it would be great the BBQ tongs could be longer. Noted there is time limit but felt that abit rushed by the staff.. as still have food on plate but was asking to clear the table.",
