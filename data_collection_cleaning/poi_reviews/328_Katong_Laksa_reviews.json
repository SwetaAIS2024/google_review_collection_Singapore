      "text": "One of Singapore’s must-try dishes is laksa, and this popular spot is known for serving the famous Katong Laksa—created by the Peranakans in the Katong area. It’s often featured in guidebooks and TV shows, and even celebrities have dropped by.\n\nTheir signature Laksa comes in two sizes ($7.30 / $9.30), with a rich, spicy soup packed with flavor from shrimp, bloody clams, coconut milk, and laksa paste. The broth has a strong shellfish taste and a nice kick—just like how the locals like it. The noodles are cut short, so you eat it with a spoon, not chopsticks. Great aroma from the laksa leaves too.\n\nThey also serve Otah／乌咑, Nasi Lemak, dim sum, and drinks. Everything is available for takeaway. Just a heads-up—cash only!\n\nIf you’re feeling extra hungry, you might want to add on some Singapore-style dim sum—like the Chili Crab Pau／辣椒螃蟹包 or Charcoal Salted Egg Custard Pau／竹炭流沙包.\n\nDelicious and super satisfying every time. A solid spot for authentic Katong Laksa!",

      "text": "Delicious laksa! The broth is rich yet well-balanced. It has quite right of spiciness. Though I would advise people who are not used to spiciness to be cautious. The noodles are cut into short ones, so it helps us to eat it comfortably with only spoon.\nThe topping size is decent enough. There are shrimp, cockles, fish cake and bean sprout. It worth the price! Even the small portion is so filling for one person!\nWould absolutely come back when I visit SG in the future!\nIt doesn't have halal certificate (I think?), but it's included in the list of halal laksa.\n(Oh, I have to add this. They have the instant version for us to bring home, and it has halal certificate!!)",

      "text": "Nice laksa, quite tasty considering it’s now a company/corporate kinda laksa. I had the shredded chicken laksa and there was a generous amount of chicken, plus egg. The otah was decent too. I added it into the soup. However, The odd thing to me was that they don’t have chopsticks! They prepare the noodles so that you can eat with just a spoon, but it was still weird. Otherwise, a reliable meal that is quickly served.",

However, I didn't see the previous auntie and wondered if it's changed owners.\nOrdering was simple with a small menu. Food was served within minutes.\nLaksa was both temperature and spicy hot, with right amount of coconut and spices, and its unique cut noodles.",
