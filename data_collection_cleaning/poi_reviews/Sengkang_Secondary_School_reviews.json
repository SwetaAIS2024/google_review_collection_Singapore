      "text": "Great neighbourhood school with a  new principal is relatable and not make us suffer by putting HBL on Friday instead of random days like the old system. Furthermore there's programmes too e.g.  'Discovery Week' or camp each year, outside school picnics to celebrate national hols, and lo hei during CNY etc. Also there are entertainment facilities like ping pong tables, Basketball tables, Tchoukball idk table and board games available for free, which are easily accessible. Canteen food are not too bad which are priced much cheaper than outside food.\n\nOverall it isnt quite a competitive/ vigrous academic environment and you can chill and have fun  most of the time. Students are alright though, nothing crazy. He teachers are great too, dedicated to teaching and friendly to students.",
