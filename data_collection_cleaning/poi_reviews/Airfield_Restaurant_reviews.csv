C,1,"DO NOT BUY from BOON CHIANG

Do not buy from boon Chiang chicken rice. They charge you extra and does not give you the extra that you ordered. They asked if I want to add egg, I said yes, they asked me twice, I said yes. Turns out my egg is missing. But I was charged the egg price.

Don't even know why airfield decided to let them open the stall here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103375945567019294714/reviews
