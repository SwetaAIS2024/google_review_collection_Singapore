Avid One,5,"I just visited and prayed at this temple this morning. I am very impressed with the good strong energies of this temple. It retains the antique traditional energy. (and I must mention that the quality of joss sticks they used are also good quality. You can smell the difference)

There is a big Jade Emperor statue facing the temple and it's so grand when u pray to heaven.

Right inside the main hall, Zhongtan Grand Marshal is right
in the middle as the main deity.

Pls come and pray at this temple. There are City God, Avalokitesvara with Thousand Hands and Thousand Eyes, and even altar of General of the Five Battalions behind the temple.

Thank you and bless you",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105672120196498329408/reviews
