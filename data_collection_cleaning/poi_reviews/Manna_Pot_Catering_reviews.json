      "text": "It was in may/june when me and my husband, Terance were searching for catering options for our church matrimony on 19/10/24. Mannapot was one of our options and was further recommended by one of my close friend.\nFirst got connected to Eileen through email and she sent me all the different options that were available and may be suitable for our wedding.\nAt the same time, there was an upcoming wedding fair at MBS and we thought of heading down to have a tasting of their food. Coincidentally, as I was initially looking for Eileen but she was engaged with another client, we were hosted by Belicia, which was the person that my friend knew and recommended but we didnt know that it was actually her standing and talking to usü§£\nBelicia then attended to us and enthusiastically showed us the different options available and the canepes were the ones that really caught our eyes. We were also looking at live stations and engaged their Laksa & Gelato cart during our wedding.\nWe received many compliments on the delicious and scrumptious canepes, laksa live station was extremely popular and had 0 leftovers!\nAlthough me and my husband didnt get to see the setup and eat the food, we were pleased to hear the many good reviews from our guests!\n\nAside from the food, as I had miscommunication with my friend which we realised that I didnt have a hand bouquet for my actual day, I contacted Belicia 3 days before my AD and thankfully she was able to take my order and have my bouquet done as well as my husband‚Äôs boutonniere.\nThe bouquet turned out very pretty even though it was a last minute order.\n\nMatthew and team were also very patient and helpful throughout from the set up to the actual day and tear down. Belicia also came down to say hello but we couldnt catch her on that day.\n\nSincerely a big thank you for making our day so wonderful and lovely with your service, care and amazing food once again! ‚ú®\nHope to have the opportunity to work together again. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nAttached the pictures that were taken on AD.",

      "text": "Got to know of MPC through a wedding fair and had a great conversation with Matthew as he led my then-fianc√© and I how their services and menus worked. Beyond having a very extensive menu and beautiful set-ups, the team was incredibly friendly and easy to work with. They were all good with various requests we had along the way and did their best to accommodate them. The set-up crew was also very friendly! Our guests thoroughly loved and enjoyed the food (:\n\nThank you, MPC for being our wedding caterer! It‚Äôs been a most pleasant and enjoyable experienced working with you. Would highly recommend anyone to engage them as their caterer for whatever events you may be having! Apologies for the lack of photos :p but do trust them to do a fantastic job in the set-up!",

      "text": "We had Manna Pot as our caterer for our wedding at The Ahava, and they played such a wonderful role in making our day unforgettable.\n\nMatthew:\nEveryone needs a Matthew (or rather, this Matthew) in their wedding planning team. Matthew was there to help us every step of the way- even before we settled on the catering, to the very last hour of packing up at the venue.\nMatthew is kind and meticulous. He listens to your ideas and requests and tries to make them work while giving gentle and great advice. Planning a wedding at the last minute (4 months before the wedding day), and all the way from Germany was not easy, but Matthew had our backs a hundred percent.¬†His warm initiative to help (even when it was not his \"duty\") and attention to detail (from the photos, electrical plugs / extensions, potential spills, to hungry guests) really had us feeling at ease and left us to enjoy our wedding without worrying about a thing. Even through what I imagine a high-stress job for him, Matthew also patiently answered all of my kancheong dad's questions (heh sorry about that, Matt!)\nWe were just saying how we wished Matthew was also there to help us for our German wedding ;)\nOne thing that was precious to us, but perhaps not on your must-have wedding point, was that Matthew took care also for those who were working that day, that they could have some of the food that was left also, before clearing up.\nKeep being you, Matthew. We are so very blessed by you and thank God for you. In you, we also found a friend üòä\n\nFood / Coffee / Dessert:\nThere is a saying in German, \"das Auge isst mit\", which is to say that \"the eyes eat together at the same time\". Who would have imagined that a buffet set up for a wedding could be so beautiful?\nEveryone had but only wonderful feedback about the catering as a whole. The food was yummy, more than sufficient, and so aesthetically whimsical.\nAlso, the coffee baristas, the servers and the cooks were all so pleasant and smiley- thank you for making our guests feel so chill, homely and taken care of.\n\nLogistics / Decor:\nThe hardworking team was there a day before to set up, and when we arrived early the next day- the hall went from an empty space to a stunning rustic scene. We did not have to worry about a thing. Additionally, we requested for dining ware instead of disposable. The flow and clean up of this was also seamless, thank you so much!\n\nAll in all, we are absolutely thankful and grateful to Matthew and the Manna Pot team.\nIf anyone asks, we would recommend Manna Pot in a heartbeat. We know we're engaging them again in fifty years for our golden wedding anniversary üòâ\nYours truly,\nLukas + Sandra\n\nOh, and in case anyone was wondering who took the beautiful photos,\nit was @TakePikChua, who was absolutely magic ‚ô•\n(But the food-food photos are from a friend)",
