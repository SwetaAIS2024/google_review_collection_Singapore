Veg-lycious,5,Overall experience is good. Tempura was crunchy and not oily. Soba noodles were cold and refreshing. Staff are friendly and prompt to refill my green tea. No much crowd on weekdays.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116348907882474656762/reviews

Leon,1,"I was welcomed by a not so happy lady manager at around 8.50pm (22/02/2025). The pork steak curry was horrible! It was tough and dry, the piece of salmon on the sushi was super thin and almost transparent. How I wish to arrive much earlier and maybe the pork will be tender, salmon will be thicker and manager will be happier...",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112861378160594698553/reviews
Cat N,3,"I visited this Japanese restaurant with a mix of expectations, and my experience was, well, mixed. The standout dishes for me were the chawanmushi. The chawanmushi was silky smooth and literally melted in my mouth! The salmon belly was flavorful.

However, the rest of the dishes are not so good. The beef teriyaki don was overwhelmingly sweet, which threw off the balance of flavors. Similarly, the sukiyaki beef soup was also too sweet for my taste.

On the service front, the staff were friendly and welcoming, but the service was a bit slow.

Overall, my experience at this Japanese restaurant was decent, but not spectacular. If you're a fan of chawanmushi or salmon belly, you might want to give this place a try. I might come back to try other dishes.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116341048858805323273/reviews
Julius Tan,4,"The pot comes with fresh fish. I particularly enjoyed the clams with mushrooms. Ebi tempura is pretty tasty too. A large variety of food in the menu, itâ€™s also suitable for a person like me who doesnt take raw food.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113038098593710664705/reviews
