Mummy ordered chicken fried rice for the kids too, but it looked like a bit too much, so she decided to save it for dinner instead.\n\nShe had the fish set meal instead. It turned out to be really spicy for her, but still very tasty!\n\nWe heated up the rice using the rice cooker, and it was only while eating that we noticed there were chicken bones in it. Thankfully, we didnâ€™t serve the chicken fried rice to our young kidsâ€”they couldâ€™ve choked on the bones!\n\nItâ€™s a terrible experience but the chicken fried rice did taste awesome!",
