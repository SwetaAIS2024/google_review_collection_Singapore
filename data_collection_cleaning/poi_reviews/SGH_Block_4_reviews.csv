At 7am those 🐔  & 🐓 Rooster are  crowing so loud and fearlessly, welcoming all visitors and staff moving around.  The roaster was at the main road near the bus stop doing its croaking and its family far in at the carpark area.

Zuo,5,"I express my gratitude to Mr. Teo Poh Lim for his assistance in waiting with my mother and me for our GrabCar. He went above and beyond, ensuring my mother's convenience and safety by helping her open and close the car door. The hospital is fortunate to have such dedicated staff members like him who prioritize the well-being of every patient entering and leaving the premises.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103637069230642753708/reviews
Joanne Lee,5,"For SGH overall, our dad has been through wards 78, 65, 58 and eventual journey at 45 over the past ~5 months.

On our family’s behalf, we would like to convey our thanks to ward 45 duty nurse for room 11, Irvin Cheong for staying behind after his duty time for our dad on 30th June (Friday) just to ensure that our dad is stable and handed over nicely to the next team for his continual care and bidding farewell to our dad in a chirpy manner to see him again the following day - 1st July (Saturday) when he is back for duty again.

Nurse Casper whom took over was also chirpy when he encouraged dad at 8pm of Friday.

Our dad passed on at 3.25pm on Saturday though.

Nonetheless, the little touch of genuine and sincere care by the medical staff, nursing staff, palliative staff etc and even the cleaning staff during dad’s admissions since Chinese New Year period has left an indelible mark in our hearts that patients are indeed at the core of all that was done.

From the bottom of our hearts, thank you, SGH for being with us through the journey and giving us bonus time with dad.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112823272563248120638/reviews
