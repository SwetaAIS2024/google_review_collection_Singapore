NAZRAMA ‚ÄúRama‚Äù,5,"Shout out to Dr Jennifer and team! I‚Äôve had my first wisdom tooth extraction some time last year, and it was a pleasant experience, at least as far as I‚Äôve remembered.

So this year, I decided to get my second wisdom tooth extraction again (for my upper right and lower left teeth), and requested for Dr Jennifer. I had no idea to what extent I could endure the pain, but I can honestly say that the surgery was almost painless and a quick one too!

Dr Jennifer and team were professional and absolutely gentle and reassuring throughout the surgery.

Thank you guys! ü¶∑ü™•",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113705329667189525036/reviews
