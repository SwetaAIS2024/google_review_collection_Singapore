YOSHIMASA HASHIMOTO,4,"There are several Bacha Coffee branches in Hong Kong, where I live, but they do not offer dine-in service. When I visited Marina Bay Sands, I discovered that they do, so I decided to go in.

We ordered two types of coffee along with churros. The coffee was flavorful, and since it was served in a pot, we were able to enjoy nearly three cups each.

The atmosphere was pleasant, with well-chosen furniture and ample space, creating a comfortable setting.

Bacha Coffee is known as one of the more expensive coffee shop chains in the world, but considering the overall experience and service, I believe it offers good value for money.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107172584852073413350/reviews
Cristina Charito,5,"We had a wonderful experience thanks to Melo, who was incredibly attentive, friendly, and accommodating. He anticipated our needs without us even having to ask ‚Äî from replacing cutlery and cleaning up a spill we didn‚Äôt even mention, to making sure we were comfortable throughout. He‚Äôs not only charming but truly goes above and beyond. The food was excellent too ‚Äî I especially loved the croissant and coffee. Truly a 5-star experience!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104912024039686866536/reviews
A B,3,"The ambiance and service are very impressive, and for that alone, this is worth a visit. The setting of the table, and the serving size of coffee is very good.
The coffee menu is overwhelming, especially if you go for the first time. We chose something recommended by our server and one of  it was good, but not the other. The pastry and Kaya croissant were very good.

3.5 as the coffee disappointed a bit .",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110960725765749160870/reviews
