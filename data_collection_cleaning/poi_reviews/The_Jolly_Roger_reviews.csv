Oceeyy Gray,3,A cute little nautical themed pub. Its a bit cranped for space but the atmosphere is friendly and easy going. There's a free pool table which is always fun! Drinks are pretty expensive but that's probably just Singapore in general,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101855153606479238297/reviews

Jitya M.Topaz,4,"We had mixed feelings about Jolly Roger. The place gave us a warm welcome, but we noticed that many items on the menu were not available that day. We're not sure if it was because of the time of day or if the chef was absent. We ordered a few items, and the food was okay, but the options were quite limited. The drinks were reasonably priced compared to other bistros. Despite that, the environment was good, and we enjoyed meeting new people and chatting. I'm not sure if I would come back unless they upgrade the menu and offer more food options. If they do, then maybe I would consider returning.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106544907846751999334/reviews
Richard Tan,4,"A hidden jem. Who would have thought there is a place lie this in a residential estate.

The ambience is fantastic and gives a very good vibe, homely atmosphere and a touch of English.

The food is good. We ordered the butter chicken with naan which is delicious and tast and Jolly Roger Burger which is also tasty as well but the source a bit salty to my liking.

Was served by Xiao Ling who is very polite and helpful.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106165873437868392637/reviews
