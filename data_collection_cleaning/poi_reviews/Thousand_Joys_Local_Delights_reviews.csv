Jacob TAN,4,"Carrot cake here is flavourful. It is fried well and then covered with a layer of egg. The egg is properly fried and it is not oily. Chilli which comes with this dish is not too spicy and is very nice. Overall, this is one of the better carrot cake stall in Singapore.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
