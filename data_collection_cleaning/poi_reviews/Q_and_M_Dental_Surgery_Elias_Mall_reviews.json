Dr Joel was assuring and calm despite seeing  such terrible condition of oral health. Extraction was done within minutes. Steady and confident gives patient a comforting experience. The nurse Hwee Yee is also friendly and helpful. My helper couldn't speak a bit of English but they patiently waited for me to translate line by line to her. Wonderful team indeed.
