Destinee Ow,5,"This clinic is great, I’ve been doing my regular cleanings with Dr Kate and also did my wisdom teeth surgery. The surgery was painless and she made me feel comfortable during the whole procedure. I was nervous before the surgery but the whole thing was much better than I expected coming from someone with low pain tolerance. I highly recommend her. She is very nice, patient and experienced. Definitely the best dentist I’ve been to and I recommended my friends to her also. The receptionist is also very nice, she responds quickly!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114326609334180145785/reviews
