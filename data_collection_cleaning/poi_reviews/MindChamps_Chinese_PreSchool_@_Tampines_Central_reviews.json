      "text": "We were so impressed after visiting MindChamps Chinese Preschool that we decided to look no further and enrolled our daughter 1 year in advance before she starts school at the age of 2.\n\nFast forward to today, it proves that our decision is a correct one. Her mandarin has improved by leaps and bounds just after attending the school for 6 months. We can feel the genuine cares of her class teachers - Jiajia Laoshi and Ren Laoshi, as they take time to correct her pronunciation and feedback to us, so that we can practise with her at home. And she comes home with cute little hairstyle every now and then shows the love and passion of the teachers. They are truly supportive and nurturing, and teach beyond the classroom. Drop-off is still tough at times, but we are grateful for the concerted effort by the team, including Ms Andrea and all the teachers on duty to make it easier.\n\nApart from MC award winning curriculum, we were attracted to their ‚Äòfun‚Äô enrichment programmes such as MC Music and the Gourmet class.\n\nThe preschool combines both play and academic-based approach for a more holistic learning and we highly recommend it.",

We also extend our gratitude to Principal Mee Lin and Director Joyce for their dedication in creating such a positive and enriching preschool experience.

      "text": "It has been a blessing to have found Mindchamps Chinese @ Tampines for both our sons as it has set a wonderful foundation for them since 18 months old, both from an academic and life-skills perspective. It was a no-brainer for us to enroll our 2nd-born Blake into the same school as his older brother as we had witnessed the positive impact that MC had on Jude especially during his early years with the Chinese immersion programme. Everyone from the centre owner, principal, to the teachers, administrative staff and support staff have been fundamental in forging a positive environment for both our children - they often speak fondly of the adults they interact with on a daily basis, which assures us that they are getting the best care daily. Teachers are constantly updating us, sending photos and moments that they find cute or meaningful - we can sense that the teachers love both Jude & Blake very much, and are heavily invested in their overall well-being. Our N1-going Blake is demonstrating more confidence in his speech and doing things independently, while K1-going Jude is starting to show a keen interest in reading/writing etc. With heavy hearts, the kids will be leaving MC Chinese at the end of March due to a house move, but we are assured that MC Chinese has set the foundation for them to thrive and excel wherever they go, equipping them with the social skills as well as academic foundations to continue their learning! Thank you everyone at MC Chinese once again, we will miss all of you!",

      "text": "Last year, I enrolled my 2 year old son to Mindchamps Chinese Preschool @ Tampines and it‚Äôs a decision I will not regret. The centre had a large spacious environment and everything is super clean. The centre director Ms Joyce was also very detailed in explaining the school‚Äôs curriculum to us.\n\nAfter 4.5 months in the school, my son's vocal skills and temperament had significantly improved. My husband and I were very impressed with how the school is nurturing him. Recently, we celebrated my son‚Äôs birthday in school which he had a lot of fun. I would like to do a shout out and show our appreciation for the staffs and teachers.\n\nBig thank you to the wonderful support from principal Ms Mee Lin. Special thanks to Jiajia laoshi and ‰ªªËÄÅÂ∏à. Fun loving Jiajia laoshi is our boy's teacher since PG class. She is genuinely very caring and passionate. ‰ªªËÄÅÂ∏à for always being patient and prompt in updating us everything. Ms Aifen, Ms Cecilia and Ms Andrea for always patiently helping and guiding our boy. 5 Stars to this amazing school team!",
