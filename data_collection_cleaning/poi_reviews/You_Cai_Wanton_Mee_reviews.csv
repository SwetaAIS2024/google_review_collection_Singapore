Natalie Wong,5,"Absolutely devoured my large 水饺面! Not sure why the reviews are generally bad but I really enjoyed my noodles. For a large size I got 6 huge dumplings, each with flavorful minced pork and a whole prawn. Noodles were also springy (quite spicy though), vegetables were not bitter and still had some crunch to them. Highly recommended!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107523181726529613913/reviews
Raymond Lim,2,"Everyone had no preference for lunch today, so we came here hoping to find something Jin Ho Jiak. 😋 Spotted a wanton mee stall with a long queue and thought it must be Good! While waiting in the queue, I checked out their reviews… wow, very bad leh. 😅😳 But since I was already in line—and I always believe in giving people a chance—I thought there must be something that draws the crowd. 🤔

Unfortunately, I was wrong. The wanton mee ($4 small, $5 big) tasted very normal—nothing special. 🤦🏻‍♂️🍜

Luckily, we also ordered a dumpling soup, which turned out to be not bad… but the soup was tasteless! 😅🥟😋",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113370341685762605307/reviews
Cheshire CL,5,"Noodles are springy, right amount of seasoning and chilli has a slight kick and if you like things spicy, ask for more chili.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103275228752404656018/reviews
T EA,4,"A delicious plate of noodles. Springy noodles with a chilli sauce that has a nice spiciness. Wantons are well stuffed with pork fillings. The dumplings offer an upgrade with water chestnuts and a shrimp, seems like these were just wrapped in the regular pork fillings without being actually mixed in so the flavors don't really gel. Minor issue. Char siew was typical cardboard like. Still an above average wanton noodle.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109317917067198241553/reviews
Danny Chong,1,"Don't understand why the queue because it's one the worst wanton noodle I had tried. Maybe the slow service which causes the pile up. The noodle is so blend and tasteless.  The only savior (reason for 2 star instead of 1) will be their dumpling which is good and full of meat. When eaten feels like  having Siew Mai in a softer version.

If you are going just for wanton noodle, do avoid.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108598657461266892300/reviews
