While exploring the coffee shop, the Hong Kong Roasted Meat & Noodle stall caught my eye, so I decided to give it a try. It turned out to be both affordable and delicious. The roasted duck, roasted chicken, and barbecued pork were all flavorful and cooked to perfection.",

The food portions are generous and the food taste good! Taste clean but very flavorful! Worth the drive and wait! Recommend for everyone to give it a try! The Rice Vermicelli inside is very good!\n\nWill come back to try the Tze Char, Dim Sum, and Roast Meat!",

Only beverage stall and Chinese zhichar opened at dinner time. Price was same as other zhichar, but the serving portion definitely is bigger. Food taste better than most of other zhichar stall elsewhere.",

The uncle even prides himself and has even asked for feedback if it‚Äôs good.\n\nThe tze char (Chinese home-cooked food mini restaurant) serves really good fresh food and at an affordable rate. Most of their patrons are mainly office staff.\n\nWhen the sunsets and once everyone has left for home, a new dawn arrives. Groups of beer enthusiast mainly male in their 50s will gather for their food, drinks, and some open mic karaoke. It‚Äôs quite a lively culture and delightful to observe how merry they are.\n\nMy observation and photos in the 2019.",
