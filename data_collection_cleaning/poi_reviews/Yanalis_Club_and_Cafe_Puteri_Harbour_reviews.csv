Kekwa Wan,1,"IF YOU ARE HUNGRY DONT COME! The first food we ordered came after 56mins. The next dishes came after 1hr + waiting. Food is cold. Fish is uncooked. Nasi goreng gila is tasty but can taste bits of the salt once in every 2-3 feed.Yuck. Ayam gunting they sprinkle chilli flakes without asking first. Crispy chicken burgerâ€™s fries is so pale and taste weird. Looks like they put it in the air fryer instead of frying it in the actual oil. Chicken satay is good but only get it after all of the other meal is at the very last bite. OVERPRICE, LONG WAITING, NOISY. Dont get the hype. Very very not worth the time and money",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241008860791347246/reviews

Noryanti S,4,"Chill and cozy place to dine in. Child friendly.
Freeflow of keropok and a variety of sambal.
Food taste authentic. Nasi ambeng sambal paru was a tad too spicy for me. Nasi goreng was nice. Penang kway teow was also great. Free flow of dessert (porridge) on fridays.
Downside is no washroom in restaurant.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109897032014004155262/reviews
