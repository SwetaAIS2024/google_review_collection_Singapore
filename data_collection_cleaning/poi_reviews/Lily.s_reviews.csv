L YS 19,5,The set menu was of good value and quality. Banh mi bread was well toasted and portion was huge with generous fillings plus choice of salad and appetizer. Pomelo salad was delicious. We ate it all up and forgot to take photo. The add on Vietnamese drip coffee is also highly recommended. We had tried the pho and bun cha before which were also good.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103645900986176946064/reviews
L Davis (SG),4,"Lunch here at 1120am. Ordered lunch set. Overall tasty food but the pho portion is a little low on the chicken ingredient. Pho tastes great and on point however just lacks that little ""chewiness"" from eating in Vietnam. Their signature cooler although was $10 tastes really great and refreshing. Didn't dare to try their black coffee but I heard it was from Vietnam direct.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112234525476361740401/reviews
Ryan Kao,1,"I had the supreme pho for dinner and it tasted pretty good; my only thought at the time was that it was that its quality and size did not match the high price point but I was craving pho in the moment.

A few hours later, I woke in the middle of the night with violent food poisoning, the results of which are too graphic to describe. I was bedridden for a day and recovered fully 2 days later (including a very unpleasant trans Pacific flight).

I wouldn't go back even without the food poisoning, though.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107334871269388260563/reviews

Olivia Choong,5,"My family comes here occasionally and I sometimes pop by with friends, usually for dinner. My favourite starter is the Grilled Lemongrass Chicken Salad, and I'd highly recommend this (unfortunately I did not take a photo). Another dish that is worth trying is the beef cheek (pictured with yellow rice), my dad orders this everytime and a friend of mine who dines here also raves about this to me. The bahn mi is great, and pho is nice, the soup stock is tasty. My husband enjoys the beef stew immensely and he is not usually partial to Vietnamese food. I think Lily's is a hidden gem and I hope it will be around for many years to come.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110109020503834407238/reviews
