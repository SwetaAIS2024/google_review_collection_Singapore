C M,1,"1st time to try the food from this shop and it’s a totally sad experience. The cream chicken and the pork ribs we ordered are both very dry and chewy.  Food tastes like reheated/recooked. They both have a burnt and salty taste. There’s no wok hei taste at all. The price of the meal is not worth it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. one star for the staff.

I will recommend the Tze Char at the corner of Punggol Rd and compassvale street. Their food is worth the price.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112885192463795342886/reviews
Andy Liew,5,"Despite the negative reviews I still came and tried it out.

Been here alot of times to eat the chicken rice and I have always been tempted by the smell of the wok hei when some uncle ordered hor fun.

Service is pretty fast as opposed to what other reviewers are stating. I got my 9 dollar medium plate of hor fun within 10 to 15 mins.

The wok hei is definitely on point and I felt that the ingredients are pretty lacklustre. For places that uses real seafood I am expecting the hor fun to be at least 10 or 12 dollars for a small to medium portion.

If you like your hor fun to be packed filled with wok hei then this is the place to go.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103601839339673088383/reviews
Andy Lee,4,Many low reviews for service. But food quality is good. We ordered via grab. The stingray is our favourite. Pork rib rice is good too.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113937067165127510810/reviews
