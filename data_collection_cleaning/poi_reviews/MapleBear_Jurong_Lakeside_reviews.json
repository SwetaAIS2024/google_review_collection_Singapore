      "text": "My husband and I visited many preschools before deciding to enroll our daughter in Maplebear Jurong Lakeside. Despite being a relatively new school, the principal and teachers are experienced and professional. Beyond that, they are nurturing, patient and truly care about the children‚Äôs well-being and development. My daughter is rather shy and the staff did all they could to support her when she started school and helped her adapt quickly to the new environment. She really enjoys going to school now and returns to tell me excitedly about what she has learned in school. So grateful to have found Maplebear Jurong Lakeside and I feel assured every time I drop off my daughter that she will be in safe and capable hands.",

      "text": "Our family is very fortunate to have discovered Maple Bear Lakeside at the start of the year. Nurturing staff, a clean and spacious facility, and a well-rounded curriculum - what more can a parent ask for in a center.\n\nThe teachers are patient and caring. Our daughter comes home daily telling us how much she loves the teachers, even those who do not teach her class. They are also very considerate, and more importantly careful when handing my daughter‚Äôs allergies. They proactively source for alternative ingredients and always check with us when in doubt,  so that my daughter can participate in the cookery lessons. Miss Joelynn, the center principal, leads by example and has been nothing but kind and helpful. When our daughter was first settling in, Ms Joelynn took the time and effort to make her feel safe, and constantly updated us on how she was doing to ease our worries. She takes any concern and feedback shared (few and far in between) seriously.\n\nThere are regular updates shared in the school app and we always look forward to the pictures/videos. The children are meaningfully engaged with the various themed activities/events. The weekly water/sand play sessions at the huge and green outdoor area are a bonus. The centre‚Äôs bilingual programme appears to be quite effective as our daughter has developed a keen interest in Mandarin, even though it is not our mother tongue.",

      "text": "MapleBear Jurong Lakeside is a hidden GEM - throughout the process of enquiring > school tour > enrolment > attending school, they are 100% and even more! Being working parents, having found such a great IFC provider, is truly a blessing.\n\nDespite the short timeline for us to secure an IFC for our LO, we are very particular about the curriculum, safety, cleanliness, passionate educators (not just nannies like many other IFCs), MB Lakeside checked all our boxes. Our LO, from being shy from strangers to being a very sociable girl and her motor skills, language (albeit gibberish) skills, senses are developing really well. It also heartening to have edu-carers like Ms Joelynn (principal), Teacher Annie, Liang Laoshi, Xiao laoshi, Teacher Wan, etc ...who are there for her every step of the way. Their passion and love for all the students are heartfelt ‚ô•Ô∏è To add on, the school is of a good size, large outdoor play area, really clean and comfortable for the children.\n\nAs our LO is sleeptrained, they also tried their best to cater to her schedule + habits and are patient to allow her to adapt in school, so it could be a seamless transition for her good night's sleep at home - we are sincerely grateful. The timely updates via the app, pictures n videos are also really appreciated. Lastly despite their really busy schedules, they must have put in extra hours before or after work to handmake teaching materials or even materials to celebrate occasions like mothers days n fathers day which is really going above and beyond.\n\nIf you're residing in the west and looking for a credible n trustworthy school for your LOs, I can say look no further, the school fees are absolutely justified.\n\nThank you üçÅ üêª  Lakeside, we can't thank you enough for the extraordinary work and support!",
