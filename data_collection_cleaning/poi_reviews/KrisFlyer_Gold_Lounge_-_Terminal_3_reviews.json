Seating configuration is varied and allows one to choose - desks for serious work, bar tables for casual work, dining tables for properly dining, sofas for chilling. Dedicated noodle station is a bonus! üëçüèªüëçüèª",

      "text": "Lovely lounge but resembled a market place. Can‚Äôt believe they allow folks to bring pillow and blankets from flight into lounge and take up every long lounge settee and tables turning the back lounge into a dormitory. Another selfish couple taking up whole 5m lounge and 4 tables even after waking up husband and wife taking up four table places each.\nSo from having a nice quiet breakfast to being swamped by circling loud ‚Äúgentlemen‚Äùlooking for a roost, the management blissfully unaware (?), talk about expensive budget lounge.\nNever again, SIA you are really are losing it.\nMaybe get some beds put in for the lounge areas so that you won‚Äôt offend anyone. That won‚Äôt offend me as I won‚Äôt be back.",

      "text": "I visited the lounge on the morning of 18 April before my flight to Frankfurt. The lounge was well equipped and comfortable enough with a good selection of food, although most were left out and soggy/lukewarm.\n\nJust a word of caution though, I very likely got bacterial gastroenteritis from the food here, which made me ill for a whole week during my vacation with persistent symptoms of diarrhoea and fever, requiring a course of antibiotics and multiple prescriptions to get better. I am almost certain as I did not eat anything else close to my flight and my symptoms came almost immediately during the flight - which is really the most unenjoyable thing on a long haul flight.\n\nThe customer affairs manager that I raised this up to reverted that they investigated thoroughly and did not find any irregularities - which I have to take their word for, although I do not know the extent of investigation nor was I  asked to furnish any further details. However, I do appreciate their response which was very polite, prompt and professional.\n\nTLDR\nJust a general precaution to be careful of what you consume lest you get food poisoning.",
