There's plenty of different kind of graders, some have only flora, others include props like animal sculptures made out of wood or mini houses by the brook. Everything was colorful and vibrant, definitely recommended to check it out, but if you wanna see everything, prepare to spend there a few hours. I wish I had the time to come back to see those artificial trees in all their glory at night. Maybe next time.",

It's such a fantastic spot to visit. Highly recommended!",
