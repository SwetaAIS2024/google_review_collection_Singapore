Didnâ€™t take a lot of pictures but my favourite was the è™¾é…±é¸¡, claypot tofu, bee hoon and the tomato egg. Very authentic putien cuisine and prices are reasonable - highly recommended, no gst no service charge! :)",

We got the suancai fish, prefer if it is not pre fried with batter. Stir fry yam and harcheonggai is good.\n\nPlace was quite packed for weekend dinner, only thing is the inside seating didnâ€™t have very good circulation so the cooking smell lingers.",

After the first visit, we went back shortly for a larger family gathering.\n\nThe food tasted great, and very flavorful. Love the beancurd pot and also the shrimp dish. However, the after effect is real, needed to drink a lot of water to get by after the meal.\n\nItâ€™s a small family restaurant type, quite nice for a weekend gathering meal. The space outside the restaurant is kinda good for young children to play around.\n\nService was great! They are very attentive and do not pressure you to leave after your meal. They also provide free dessert which was quite nice to end the meal.\n\nItâ€™s now our go to place for gatherings, but perhaps the next visit, I would request for less salt, less oil and less sugar ðŸ¤£",
