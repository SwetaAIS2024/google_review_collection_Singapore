Tristen Ng,1,"12 April 2025 - Fun toast Hougang 1 - you need to train your staff on basic courtesy and work ethics.

Why provide a receipt for collection with order number and NOT press out the number?

The staff told me “we don’t press the order number, we shout out the number.”

What if I don’t hear it? My coffee is cold already.
This is ridiculous.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109463049245499842797/reviews
Ryphaelle Ng,1,"Went in the morning at 9+ to get my coffee fix. Took 20+ min for a cup of coffee.

No sense of urgency at all. Do we really need 20+ min to make coffee?

Slow until I’ve watched at least 5 customer in queue walk away.

Worst thing? There wasn’t even a lot of customers sitting in the restaurant. Only 3 tables had people.

Seriously either train your staff or get more because 20+ min for a cup of coffee when there’s no one on the restaurant is a ridiculous amount of wait time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109075944009277452697/reviews
Julia Fang,1,"Got a set at $5.90, charged me extra $1.80 to switch to a cold drink. Went there a few times and they didn’t charge me, but i got charged this time around. I understand if it was $1 max but $1.80 seems abit far fetched. I clarified with the cashier and she just brushed me off. There should be consistencies and transparency in your pricing (note it down somewhere), so that customers can see and everyone abides by it. Now I don’t know if the price is accurate due to the inconsistency and lack of transparency.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105012383692132655008/reviews
