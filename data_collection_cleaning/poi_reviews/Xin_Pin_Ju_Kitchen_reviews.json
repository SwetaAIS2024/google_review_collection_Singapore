I was really shocked to discover that dangerous piece of metal. Imagine having swallowed it! I can't imagine how it can be removed if it was stuck halfway in the body.\nBe careful when consuming food, it can happen anywhere to anybody.",

      "text": "Xin Pin Ju Kitchen is a solid coffeshop zichar nestled in the West Coast HDB blocks. It stands out among with well-executed dishes and presentation.\nThe Jin Yu Man Tang combination platter is a highlight, impressing with both its taste and stunning presentation. Though it's not cheap at around $75 and requires advanced ordering. The dish does differentiate the zichar ability to elevate amongst the typical coffeeshop eatery.\nOther popular zichar staples like beef hor fun and har cheong gai (prawn paste chicken) are reliably done.\nHowever, the stall isn't without its missteps. The sambal stingray was marred by an unpleasant ammonia odor. The chef offered to replace it with crayfish, demonstrating good customer service. Unfortunately, the replacement dish was also so-so.\nDespite this setback, it remains a solid choice for zichar in the area. Given the strengths in presentation and execution of most dishes.",

      "text": "Great food at a reasonable price! Initially skeptical about trying the coffee pork ribs, I was pleasantly surprised! They were absolutely yummy and worth the risk. The menu here goes beyond the usual tze char options, offering unique dishes that are different frim the norm. Really enjoyed the pomfret dish with an otah-style twist. Quite a creative masterpiece!\n\nVisited on a Sunday night, and there's a bustling crowd. Would definitely recommend and come back again!",

Waste my money $7 and I have to order other food for lunch. No refund and no apologies from the staff and boss. Will never eat this zir char",
