Keify Toh,5,"My type of Mutton Briyani!  Taste excellent and generous portion of mutton at only $6.50.

Great varieties.

My empty plate is a good testimonial of how delicious it is, isn't it?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107787013562023002862/reviews
Cheow Mong Chan,4,"Chanced by this prata stall and gave it a try. Made on the spot, unlike usual prata stalls which have mountains of pre-made cold pratas at the side.
Prata was served hot, taste was quite ok, just that not crispy (-0.5 star) (might have to ask for more crisp). Vegetarian curry (Dal) was too watery (-0.5 star), thou taste wasn't too bad. I have tasted better pratas but this was decent.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116936834742186304043/reviews
