Then after 5-mins another staff claimed need another 7-minutes. Hello? I‚Äôve waited 35 minutes for a ‚Äúfast food‚Äù? Averagely even restaurant need only 15-20mins to prepare a steak. What are you guys doing?\n\nThis is when it‚Äôs not even busy when we first arrived! A large group came after we seated for 25mins, became super noisy. They got their food first. Noticing an issue, I approached the counter that‚Äôs no one is there.\n\nStaff not well trained, some bantering and goofing round.\n\nAfter 45mins, I changed my order to take away. My order of double prosperity burger, large fries and pineapple tart, was given to me after 50 mins of wait. No apologies given. My burger and fries was at the counter waiting for pineapple tart for close to 50mins.\n\nFries quality dropped so low it‚Äôs not even close to McD‚Äôs fries standard.\n\nI live nearby and reach home in 5 mins. My prosperity burger is cold, and fries soggy. I rather go to the next worst McD outlet - Caltex. That‚Äôs how terrible this outlet is.\n\nWorst McDonald outlet. Management please review your franchisees. The variances in services and food quality is noticeable.",
