Lots of toys everywhere, and a little shop with cute stuff for cat fans. Pantry with snacks and drinks included in the price. Some cats may be a little unfriendly, as they have been rescued from the street - be mindful of it. All the cats can be adopted btw!",

      "text": "This is my go-to place for peaceful work sessions. Everyone is usually very quiet and discreet when playing with the cats. Some cats are friendly and might accompany you, while others prefer to be left alone. The pantry offers coffee, tea, and water, which is sufficient for refreshment.\n\nThe private rooms are a great addition, providing extra privacy or a space to play games. They even built small doors for the cats to enter the private rooms, though they rarely use them. The space is cozy, with some adjustable height tables and all equipped with power outlets for charging laptops. Overall, it's a great environment for productivity and relaxation.",

I love how they take in stray cats, put them up for adoption, and put in the effort to advocate for black cats. I miss Bobbi very much but I’m sure it’s very happy at a new home! Great place for studying, and all the cats are always so well-behaved!! and the staff is polite too.",

The cats were mostly minding their own business/hiding but I still managed to interact with a few cats after waiting for them to get used to me (aka holding out your hand and waiting for them to come to you). The staff was very friendly and approachable, and the cats were super cute. :)\n\nIt's important to note that these cats are being fostered and may not be friendly immediately! Please don't force them to interact with you, cats have claws for a reason haha",
