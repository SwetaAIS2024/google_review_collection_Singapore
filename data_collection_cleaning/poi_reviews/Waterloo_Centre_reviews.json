So worth waiting at the gantry for a lot. It is a HDB carpark. So the charges are lower than all other carparks in that area.\n\nThere are many retail outlets and eateries on the ground floor.\n\nUpstairs are HDB apartments.",

It is also conveniently located 2 streets away from the National Library, which is a bonus for people studying there. Clearly a hidden gem in the city centre!",

Very good rice n curry dishes too.  Curries r gob smacking good! Try it n tell me abt it.  For Malay stall, simply love their Kueh Lopes - the triangular glutinous rice coated w salted coconut n drizzled w gula melaka.  Here they got it all right, texture of kueh, freshness n texture of coconut n sweet saltiness of gula melaka.  $1.20 for a piece of heaven.  N then the chicken rice, queue is really long but its definitely worth it.  Yong Tau Foo üëç.",
