We just got some pastries at their neighbors, konditori, and though some cafe drinks would be a good match.\n\nHad some trouble picking one and asked the staff for recommendations. She said her go-to was the peach matcha latte. Boy, was that a great pick.\n\nOne wouldn't normally think peach and matcha went together but it was so good. The only thing was that the cost was a tad steep.",

The taste has remained consistently delicious over the years, which keeps me coming back.\n\nThe price is definitely worth it for the generous portion you get. This time, I got the Thai Green Milk Tea—one of my all-time favorites. Rich, smooth, and just the right level of sweetness. Highly recommend!",
