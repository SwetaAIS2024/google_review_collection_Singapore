      "text": "Excellent TCM at Tampines Grande! I have been plagued by rashes for the past 2 years and visited a number of western doctors including skin specialists and TCM but the condition did not improve and the rashes kept coming back. Then I was recommended to Chong Hoe Healthcare and decided to pay a visit and saw Dr James Chan. He was extremely patient and knowledgeable. He looked at my condition and explained to me in detail and let me know how he will be able to treat my condition.  Only a week past and my skin rashes was almost fully recovered and I can also sleep better at night. I will certainly continue to see Dr Chan for my overall wellness. Also, the clinic exudes a very calm and pleasant atmosphere.\nThank you, Dr James Chanüëç",

After the session, the physician Fang Ting, did a good job and gave us a lot of tips on how to help improve my dad's condition. Additionally, I opt for a cupping session and she also gave me advice and a list of ingredients I can purchase for my wellbeing. I truly appreciate the information and attentiveness by the physician and highly recommend this place. Will be back soon for both our next session! üòä",
