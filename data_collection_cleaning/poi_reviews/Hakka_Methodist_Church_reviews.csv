cse1217,5,"This is a church with great and long history. Although there are a lot of senior citizens here, they are very friendly and vibrant.

There are services in Hakka, Philipines and also English. They have line dancing as well for the seniors to learn and befriend each other.
The strong ties among all the seniors are really very lovable. They are also very faithful to come church every week.

They also organise yearly trips to bond the seniors together.
