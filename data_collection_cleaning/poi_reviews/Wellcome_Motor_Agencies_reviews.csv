Gisele To,5,"I’ve been renting my current car from Wellcome Motor for about 4 years now and their service has been exceptional.

One of my car’s tyres went flat once and they sent down the technician to bring my car back for repair within an hour. They would also remind me for car servicing every 6 months.

I would highly recommend them to any friends looking to rent cars or commercial vehicles.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100241807372099994454/reviews
