The ambience, service and quality of food made the entire dining experience enjoyable.\n\nFirst, we were welcomed with warm bread and butter - simple yet so delicious we asked for more! The cold truffle pasta with caviar and king crab leg with tomato rice were eye opening for both us and our tastebuds, highly recommended!\n\nDesserts also did not disappoint and our tummies were extremely pleased when we left. We‚Äôll be back!",
