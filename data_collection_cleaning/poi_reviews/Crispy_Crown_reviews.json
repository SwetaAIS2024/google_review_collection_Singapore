      "text": "Just tried this place today and I was very impressed. I lived in South Korea for 4 years, so I have been looking for a place that had the authentic taste I was missing. Crispy Crown is almost exactly the same! The spicy red sauce has the legit KorFC taste, too.\n\nAnother thing I love about this place is that they make the chicken to order unlike KFC or other chains. You get fresh, crispy, out-of-the-fryer chicken, and the chicken is cooked to perfection.\n\nAs for the staff and dining area, everything was very clean (couldnâ€™t eat-in due to MCO) and the staff were very friendly.\n\nMy only complaint is minor, and it has to do specifically with my order. I ordered the Korean Chicken set (~RM46), but you have to pay extra for sauce. This may be a franchise policy, but I feel that for a large order of chicken, at least 1 sauce should be included. Other than that I was extremely satisfied!",

You might need to wait a while for your food so don't go there if you're absolutely starving.\n\nI'm happy to see reusable cups, trays, and utensils. However, please, no need for plastic straws.",
