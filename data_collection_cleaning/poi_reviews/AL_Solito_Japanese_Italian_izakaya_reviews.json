      "text": "Been coming to this cosy izakaya bar since 2020 for their uni pasta. Itâ€™s perfectly al dente and with a generous amount of uni. We also really like the fried camembert. The prices are on the high side, given the portion sizes, though generally the food standard is good.\n\nService is warm and there are always Japanese diners every time we visit.\n\nOn our most recent visit, we were encouraged to give a 5-star review in exchange for complimentary desserts. The Azuki Daifuku and Genmai-Matcha Ice Cream are recommended (not to mention a great pairing).\n\nTheir Whatsapp line also makes it easy to make reservations now.",

Love the Yamaimo somen which is a refreshing twist to what you would expect from Japanese yam. Mostly patronised by Japanese so you can be assured of its quality. They even gave us a free birthday cake with music played and everyone was spontaneous enough to wish the birthday girl! Definitely worth another visit!",

The cold uni pastas was also really good, and uni was fresh. Will be coming back.\nNote they do require a minimum of 1 drink per person, but it doesnâ€™t have to be alcoholic :)",

The uni pasta was so creamy and the pasta was cooked to perfectionðŸ’¯  Roast wagyu was a pleasant surprise as it was a cold dish but cooked to perfect medium rare served with salad.\n\nService was very good & hiromi-san is just the sweetest lady ever. Highly recommended!!!!",
