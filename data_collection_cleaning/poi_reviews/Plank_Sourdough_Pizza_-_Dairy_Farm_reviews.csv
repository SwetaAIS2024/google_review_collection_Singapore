Jeff Tan,5,"After our hike at dairy farm , we head over to the dairy farm mall to have pizza .
Ordered a pepperoni and the other one with parma ham .

The parma ham pizza had the under side too charred and bitter , but the kitchen gracefully did us another one .

Over all we had a great time dining here , the staff are courteous and service is good .

Thank you guys",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116105661236167567881/reviews
Deadprawn,1,"The pizza that I ordered is really disappointing. We order Pizza 1 V which stated in the menu that it comes with mozzarella cheese and added extra topping for pepperoni. As you can see from the 1st photo the pizza served to us, it comes with only tomato sauce and no cheese. We checked with the service crew and was told that the cheese is mixed in with the tomato sauce. We really don’t taste any cheese on the pizza, clearly it was not added. They quickly offer to pass us some parmesan cheese flakes. The sourdough is good tho. For the price of $27.50 for such a lousy quality pizza, it’s totally not worth.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110205876897743182166/reviews
LC Chong,5,"Had an early dinner at this little cafe and felt compelled to review after seeing the limited no of reviews here. Pizza toppings very generous and tasted good. As someone who usually leaves the pizza crust aside, I liked the sourdough crust so much that I finished every bite.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112190131844304280898/reviews
