      "text": "Came here approx 1218am on the 1st of April.\nUsed machine 6 and 3 for washing. Started both between 3-4 minutes apart. Machine 3 completed washing 39 minutes later but machine 6 was still at 15 minutes and rinsing.\nSo I went for a walk and came back approx 5 minutes later and it was still showing 15 minutes. Worried that something is wrong with the machine, I stood there for a few good minutes. The timer was still at 15 minutes.\nSo I rang up the hotline and spoke. To Mr Tan.\nExplained the current situation, he then said it’s too late and he will send someone in the morning. I addressed my concern about the clothes being rinsed and soaked the entire night, told him some are a little expensive. He then said\n“Expensive clothes don’t wash in laundry go dry cleaner next time. Why you wash here?”\n\nFirstly I paid for this washing service not given free so whether I go to the dry cleaning or laundry it’s none of his business tbh.\nHe was so so rude honestly, then I mentioned aren’t all machine supposed to be checked and serviced regularly, why did this happen. He then said again if I’m so concern I shouldn’t use the laundry service. I also did mention about my worry regarding soaking it overnight, he said some people soak their clothes anyways, it’s no big deal.\nHe was no help and very very rude.\nWill he react the same if this happens to him? His family?\n\nIt’s very upsetting and I swear to never return back to this laundry ever again.\nI could turn a blind eye about the machine, but his attitude nope.\nA very rude person",
