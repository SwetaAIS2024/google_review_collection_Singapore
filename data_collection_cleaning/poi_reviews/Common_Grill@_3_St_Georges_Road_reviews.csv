Smelly Techou,5,"In a convenient Coffee shop, great option for western food especially for children. $10.90 for this margarita pizza. Even the  Kirby’s fan is so in love with it. Felt expensive in the beginning but think half size is around $5. Okay, that’s cheaper than some places for that portion.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106237849201285869805/reviews

Javier Tan,5,"This is one of the stalls where the picture is actually smaller than the portion. Food was decently cooked!  Very amazed and impressed. The staff was extremely friendly and price was not too expensive! Definitely buying again.
Came back and the staff was still as friendly! For the price, the food is decent but not to die for!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106617631020704357051/reviews
Ping,1,"Ordered the signature crispy chicken.

Honestly damn shocked at how thin the chicken was. It was 80% batter 20% meat. First time see such a desperate attempt to cut costs. New low.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111766052547410897014/reviews
Michelle Lim,5,"The food is fantastic! The price is worth as well for its huge portion. suggest everyone to come on weekday, as weekend is usually crowded and have to wait longer than usual. We waited for 15 mins for Our meals so I believe is still acceptable on a Friday night.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110706099145631006148/reviews
