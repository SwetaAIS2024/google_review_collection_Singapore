Lim Xiang Long,4,"Definitely the most reliable station to go to wherever I go beyond my town. However, improvements at the road beside the station and the connections can be improved though I am seeing a lot of improvements in progress. Toilet has been refurnished and looks clean. Pleasing music and staff during peak hours, though the station is getting old. Overall rating: 4.15/5",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112449595722086972837/reviews

Daryl Eng,4,"Small quiet village, getting more crowded and rowdy people. Or feel more like people around sg is getting less polite and less gracious and more entitled? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don't know, just a small 2 cent thoughts. Others may feel differently.
Still yew tee is a peaceful place to stay and live by. Got Kopitam, kuofu, toast box, yaku, starbuck and coffee beans, all packed into 1 small mall",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113612114161261662885/reviews
