Though perhaps not the trendiest, it retains a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere, making it a reliable and personally significant destination for me.",

      "text": "The Centrepoint is an interesting mall at Orchard which has non-Orchard vibes. This mall has interesting tenant mix - mainly focused on the arts (dance, Taekwondo, music) and aesthetics (jewellery and fashion). There's a random Beauty in the Pot on the top level as well. Fun to drop by whenever I'm at Orchard. It also has those random games that they constantly change according to the trends - like Animal Kaiser and Pokemon Gaole.",

I have been coming here with my mother since I was a child decades ago, and now it is somewhere I can bring my own! They have reinvented themselves with a nice renovation, with stores like Decathlon on ground level and Cellini on third level providing many offerings. There are restaurants for everyone too. Will be back again for sure!",
