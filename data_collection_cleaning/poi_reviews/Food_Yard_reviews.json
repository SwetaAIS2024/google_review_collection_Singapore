And I've changed my order items due to our workers are vegan.. and *Nila* has been patience enough to keep updating my orders. This is first class service.\n\nTalk about food quality. I've ordered 18 - 30 packs in 1 shot but nothing changed and tasted just great pippin hot food served.\n\nDelivery is on the dot. I need it for lunch they delivered on lunch time.\n\nSide note for Nila, you've done a great job and your are still doing great. Keep it up!!",
