Gator,4,"If youâ€™re craving authentic Korean flavors without the plane ticket, Myeong Dong restaurant is your answer. Drawn here by a friendâ€™s glowing recommendation, I left utterly convincedâ€”this spot nails the balance of homely comfort and vibrant Seoul-style dining.

The seafood pancake (haemul pajeon) was a crispy, golden masterpiece, loaded with tender squid, shrimp, and scallions, paired with a tangy dipping sauce that cut through the richness perfectly. But the star was the Korean ginseng chicken soup (samgyetang): a steaming, fragrant clay pot of tender whole chicken stuffed with glutinous rice, swimming in a broth that whispered of earthy ginseng and subtle garlic. One sip transported me back to a cozy eatery in Seoulâ€”that level of authenticity. The pork skewers were juicy and charred just right, while the fresh oysters were plump and briny.

Service here is a highlightâ€”warm, attentive, and quick to offer suggestions or refill banchan (those addictive kimchi sides!). The staffâ€™s genuine smiles and eagerness to share their favorites added a welcoming touch to the meal.

As for pricing? Expect reasonable rates that wonâ€™t shock your wallet.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
Kenny Lim,5,"I had quite frankly the best Korean bbq buffet Iâ€™ve ever had on Christmas Eve here.
Fresh meats, fresh vegetables, and even the soup was authentic and amazing.
They charge what was advertised in front of the shop, and delivered a meal experience over and beyond my expectations. My wife couldnâ€™t stop praising herself for spontaneously picking the place for dinner.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111483447838647791173/reviews

zhenchuan chua,4,Overall the food is above average. The portion is average. Do not order cold noodle (we find it very awful to eat). staffs will ask if you prefer to grill meat at your table or they just serve ready grilled meat.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108647365080818588368/reviews
