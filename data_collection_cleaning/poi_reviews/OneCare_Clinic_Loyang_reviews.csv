Emman K,3,"The counter staff were great and really helpful. However the doctor was extremely dismissive of symptoms and had seemed disinterested in patient communication. Overall wouldn't recommend, especially for the price tag.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111497950158485115120/reviews
MD,5,"I visited OneCare Medical Clinic at Loyang Point.The clinic was clean and well-maintained, and the staff were polite and efficient. The wait time was reasonable, and I was seen by Dr. Darshana, who was professional and thorough in his assessment. He took the time to listen to my symptoms and provided clear advice on the treatment plan. Overall, I had a positive experience, and I appreciate the care provided.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100395543134526701664/reviews
Fee Su,5,Clinic staff were super friendly and prioritised me as my symptoms were more severe. The Indian Doctor ( I’m sorry I didn’t get his name!!) was super duper reassuring and friendly. He listened to my concerns intently and gave clear advise. I really enjoyed my time at this clinic. I would definitely choose this GP in the future.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106894376609977622146/reviews
Chloe Lim,1,"I had a terrible experience at this clinic on 2nd Jan. I arrived at the clinic around 7:20–7:30 PM, feeling very unwell and seeking medical attention. Despite waiting for nearly two hours, I was informed around 9.15pm that the doctor had to leave due to an urgent matter. This left me and several other patients unattended

While I understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, the lack of proactive communication was disappointing.The clinic staff should have informed us earlier if there was a possibility that the doctor would be unable to see all the patients (the clinic operations hour is end at 9pm) This would have allowed us to make alternative arrangements instead of waiting unnecessarily.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106390382933531455423/reviews
Yu Li,1,"I went to the clinic on 17 Feb 2025 at 715 pm. At 8pm, the doctor has only seen 2 patients. The doctor saw each patient for 5 min and  took 15-20 min in between patients. I don't know what he was doing inside the office alone for so long. Hope the management will look into this. Otherwise, we patients should just stay away.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117682221406970671586/reviews
