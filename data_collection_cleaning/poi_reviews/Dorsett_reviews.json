Really interesting metal art work on the walls.\nOur room was large and very comfortable and clean. A great shower! We will use this hotel again when returning to Singapore",

Likely due to the location being abit further away from central.\n\nIf you aren't looking to travel to the central frequently, and maybe looking to explore around the east of singapore, I'd highly recommend this hotel",
