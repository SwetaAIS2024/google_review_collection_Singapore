Iris Tan,4,"The ordering system was a bit confusing—we only wanted some of the skewers to be spicy while keeping the rest non-spicy, but everything ended up being spicy. As a result, we had to buy drinks, and our taste buds ended up feeling numb.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100750879813834973372/reviews

jayden,2,"The BBQ box outlet here is not that nice as compared to the one in geylang and east coast road, the taste of the skewers are a little off and not that tasty especially the mid joint chicken wings. Don't why the foods here tasted less marinated, cumin or the spice powder? Even the slice beancurd skin also tasted blend, you can even taste the doughy raw beancurd skin taste. The butter on the toast was very spare minimum, in fact it wasted more like a white bread with sugar on it.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
Ching Wu,5,"🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 OBSESSED with their Mala Seafood Hotpot! The broth is numbingly spicy and umami-rich – plump shrimp and squid swimming in chili oil will make you sweat but crave more. Pro move: Add hand-pulled noodles to soak up that addictive soup – TOTAL GAME CHANGER! 🍜

Skewers? 🔥PERFECTION! Juicy lamb kebabs with crispy edges, smokey charred corn... everything's grilled to order and tastes stupid fresh. Staff even taught me a secret noodle-dipping hack! Spice addicts, this place is your happy place. RUN DON'T WALK! 🦐🍢",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115269475316191802689/reviews
