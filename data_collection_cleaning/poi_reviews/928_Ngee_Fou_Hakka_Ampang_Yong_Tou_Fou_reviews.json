      "text": "One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore! üá∏üá¨‚ù§Ô∏è\nDropped by 928 Ngee Fou (Hakka) Ampang Yong Tou Fou for lunch on a Sunday with a good friend (a proud Hakka!) to enjoy some authentic Yong Tou Fu.\n\nWe ordered the signature Yong Tou Fu set and the special dumpling soup. Everything was freshly prepared, and I especially loved the combination of kangkong and tofu. The real hero? The rich, flavorful gravy ‚Äì it ties everything together perfectly, soaking into the veggies and tofu to create a truly satisfying bite. ü•¨üßÑü•¢\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe restaurant gets hot and lively during lunch hours, packed with customers ‚Äî a true sign of how popular and delicious the food is! üî•üçΩÔ∏è\n\nParking:\nRoadside (paid) parking available nearby. It can get busy during peak times, so do plan ahead if you‚Äôre coming during lunch.\n\nOverall:\nStill one of my go-to places whenever I crave good, authentic Hakka Yong Tou Fu. Definitely staying on my must-visit list whenever I'm back! ü´∂",

What you need to note is the items are fixed and they have no noodle only rice.\n\nChili is nothing special and oh yeah there is no soup. Ingredient wise the only unique piece was the mildly fried quail eggs which doesn't taste particularly special.\n\nTheir fried and non fried tofu etc was just average. The fried dumpling might slightly be on the saltier side but it was still okay.",
