I often suffer from sniff necks that would lead to migraine and vomiting (sometimes). I find that the adjustments helped to relief tensions due to daily desk work. Highly recommend everyone that has spinal issues to visit the clinic.",

Have met many other chiropractors but haven’t felt not much improvement.\nDr. Brad has been doing an amazing job.  He really knows what he's doing and he's very honest. Throughout his session, not only my shoulder pain is starting to less severe and but also learned about the body and how it works.\nHe is a generous Doctor who cares about his patients. Highly recommend him! I highly recommend this place for anyone who's contemplating getting chiropractic care! s. I wish I had come sooner!!\n\nSandy ( front desk lady) is always helpful , nice and pleasant too.",
