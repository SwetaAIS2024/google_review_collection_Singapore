ÂºæÂ°ö„É©„Ç§„Ç¢„É≥ÔºàRaiÔºâ,3,"This shopping mall has a legendary eatery. The auntie and the young guy, who I think is her son, were very nice. However, there‚Äôs an older uncle who seems to have taken all the stress of this mall and turned into someone even grumpier than the Grinch. The food is freshly cooked if you arrive early, around 10 AM to 11 AM, and the prices are very affordable. Keep up the good work, auntie and young man! As for the uncle, I hope a fairy godmother visits you someday so you can enjoy happier days on this earth. üôàüòÇüôèüèæüòúüëçüèæ",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102139557954936444735/reviews

Sean Goh,3,"Was running some errands around upper serangoon shopping centre and decided to settle my lunch over there. Chance upon this eatery on the 3rd level. Apparently, they sell economical rice. They also sell the standard zhichar fare like hor fan and fried rice.

Decided to go with their horfun, which was SGD$4.50. The horfan comes with the usual ingredient of prawn and sliced fishcake and pork. They used the thinner horfan instead. I believed the horfan was freshly fried but lack the wokhei .Portion was quite small, and may not be filling.

Overall, average plate of horfan for me.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
