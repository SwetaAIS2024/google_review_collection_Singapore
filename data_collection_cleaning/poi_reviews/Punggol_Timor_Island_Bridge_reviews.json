Idyllic.\n\nNo public transport brings you here,  so you will have to walk or cycle or perhaps take a cab.\n\nThe walkway is too narrow for comfort,  since you have to watch out for cyclists. Most of the cyclists i met on this route seemed polite though.\n\nI stopped over for about 10 minutes while on my journey to Yishun dam",

It took me about 45mins.\nIt was early morning about 8am at Punggol Timor Island, I was simply amazed by the scenery. You can see tall casuarina trees stretching along the coastline.\nNo wonder, newly-wed couples like to come here to take pictures.",
