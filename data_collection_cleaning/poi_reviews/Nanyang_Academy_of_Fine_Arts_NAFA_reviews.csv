Bear Chua,4,"Very very artistic place
School is huge and campus is everywhere in town in bugis area
Vibes is positive and really bubbly.
Look at the picture I shared
Looks really good for students who want a cosy environment to study and do well.

Convenient too many buses available just beside the school :)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112339417351827380279/reviews
Happee Xoxo,1,"The worst school experience, leaving behind trauma and bad memories. Some lecturers are biased and unhelpful.

One of the worst moments was when a lecturer was inattentive during my presentation despite my disability—either staring blankly into space or using her phone. And it didn’t just happen once. It happened more than twice.

Bias and favoritism are very real here, so choose your diploma wisely.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108376392506221632827/reviews
Bwaaup,1,"Don’t bother taking a diploma here. Staying up late to do work everyday until 5am, lecturers that are biased. Assessments and projects are pushed so far back towards the end of the term everything is so rushed. And they expect you to finish everything. Pls don’t waste ur diploma life here",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103783617424963564655/reviews
JY ONG,1,"The lecturer are biased
Worst learning experience ever
Expensive fee and doesn’t match what we will learn and what we deserved.

A place that will only destroy your art / music dreams

The school mates are very toxic too. Not helpful at all",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108723636190742855021/reviews
