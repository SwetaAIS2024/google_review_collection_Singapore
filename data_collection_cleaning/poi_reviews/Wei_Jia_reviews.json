      "text": "We come to this coffee shop at least once a week during school term. Roughly once a month would eat this with my wife.\n\nBan Mian is full of ingredients and soup has robust flavour, akin to Qiu Lian of the old days.\n\nFried dumplings are handmade by the stall auntie and they are always fried to order, so it’s always fresh and crispy. Also filled with ingredients.\n\nAuntie at the stall is OMO, she doesn’t talk much, but she’s polite with her manners. Even though I don’t eat at her stall every day, she remembers my orders and always automatically gives me the extra bowl for sharing with my wife. Really appreciate it!",

The made-to-order pork cutlet was crisp even after being dipped into sauce! Will definitely come back for more!",

      "text": "A very underrated noodle (ban mian) shop. The lady boss works there probably every single day, and her humble (and numerous variations of) noodles and soups are always so satisfying. Her Ma La noodle (Dry You Mian) is a must-try for Mala aficionados. The sauce is robust with a satisfying amount of heat and the all-important numbing spice.\n\nOh and not to forget, she has the best dumplings ever! You will often see people ordering just a plate of her awesome dumplings (fried or steamed) if they are not adding it to their noodles as a side dish.\n\nBest soup dish: You Mian\nBest dry tossed noodle dish: Pork ribs noodle, Ma La You mian, Pork cutlet noodle, chicken cutlet noodle",
