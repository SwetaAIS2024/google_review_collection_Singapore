The quality of the fish used is great - itâ€™s not Dory but I think Pollack (similar texture as McDonaldâ€™s fish fillet). Fries were well fried, salad was fresh and dressing was refreshing. Portions are big too. We visited for a second time within a week! The owners are really friendly and take pride in their food. We sat near the shop and the owners were so sweet to bring the food to us despite us being provided with a buzzer.",

Formerly a chef in a Japanese Restaurant.\nRefine,fresh & fusion .Closed on Monday.\nChilli ðŸ¦€sauce & salted egg chicken chop are something different  !\nThey are meticulous so even presentation is done in a neat & tidy manner.\nRecently revamped their new menu . Even better !! With lots of side dishes mushroom soup ,spaghetti ,mashed potato & salad.\nMentaiko chicken burger with fries is good too ! Support our hawkers !!! They work very hard to provide us with tasty & quality food at a reasonable price  ! Don't stare at the menu  just try & ask you will not be disappointed.\n\nQuality over price !!! If you are always on a hawker center budget then they are not for you ! Remember everyone needs an upgrade !\nðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£\nRestaurant standard at hawker center !",

If you are ordering in bulk you can call them in advance.\n\nI have tried the fish and chips. The fish is good quality cod fish, not the normal dory fish given elsewhere. Value for money!",

Chicken chop was nicely done with a crisp skin, french fries are also lightly salted, mashed potatoes are good too! Would advise against ordering their steak but go for their chicken dishes. The chicken chopâ€™s portion was just nice for its price ~$8",

Cooked fresh upon order. Fish was whitefish unlike cheap dory and tasted more like cod. Friendly staff too. Closed on Mondays I think. Will visit again to try other dishes.",
