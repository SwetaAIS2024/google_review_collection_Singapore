Zenobia Loh,2,$45 for 2 pax and not full after the meal ðŸ˜• portion is kinda small. The sauces selection not that great. Kinda mediocre selection. Taste wise cant really go wrong right mookata is just mookata. Shocked at the vermicelli because for so little its a dollar. Literally suck 1 time all gone.

Roan A,5,"A hidden gem in Punggol. The staff are nice and friendly. Once you've arrived, they will immediately assist you and give the things you'll need for your mookata experience.

The prices of their food are very affordable. We ordered 6 kinds of meat (pork and chicken), vegetables, tofu and noodles that were good for 3 persons and we only paid $34. ðŸ™ˆ

If you want to try this, I would highly recommend to visit before 6pm as there will be a long queue from 6pm onwards even on weekdays.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114613040629874192080/reviews

Paul Toh,4,"This place is walking distance from the Nibong LRT station and on weekends, it gets really crowded.
Food wise - value for money. I paid $45 for a 4 pax set which comes with chicken, pork sausages, 4 prawns, squids and assorted mushrooms and vegetables. I added on some beef short plates for 3.40 each and smoked duck for another 3.60 each.
The meats are not the best cut, just like what you expect from other mookata.
The soup is not very tasty, actually after youâ€™ve put in the corn, everything tastes corn-yish.
Service is friendly and fast.
Drinks are expensive here. Go buy from Sheng Shiong next door (joking joking)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110584107240453374/reviews
