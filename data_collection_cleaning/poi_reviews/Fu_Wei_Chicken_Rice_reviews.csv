Aravindhan Ravikumar,5,"On Sunday 13 April 2025, I had the chicken rice with braised egg and tofu for my lunch at the Kopitiam food court at FairPrice Hub in Joo Koon, and I liked this meal as the chicken rice with braised egg and tofu tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these other chicken dishes from the other Fu Wei Chicken Rice outlets in the future.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106935057144500350420/reviews
