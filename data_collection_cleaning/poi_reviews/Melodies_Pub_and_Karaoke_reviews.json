      "text": "Simple pub set up with Karaoke and pool table. There are so called Chinese Artist that will sing some songs at stage during the interval but don't expect much. Most frequent Karaoke singer can do much better than them. The pool table are less occupied. Hence the queue is not to long. As for the Karaoke, it will take hours before the next round comes in as all bar counter are also given 2 songs. There are about 12 tables and 18 counters. So imagine if all occupied, 30 number * 2 songs would take 180 minutes to complete one round.",
