linteoh,4,"Parking: very small sheltered carpark. The open air carpark at macs can sometimes be full too. Alot more open air parking along the entrance of carpark

Level 2 activity room:
For exercise classes. Nice big room, everything looks new and clean. Excellent space!

Toilets:
Level 1 toilet next to the lift is DISGUSTING. Very few cubicles, smelly, dirty, wet.

The other level 1 toilet that you have to access through the outside walkway next to the drop off point is very clean, many cubicles, BUT narrow. I have to squeeze myself out whenever I open and close cubicles door while carrying my bag. Also I feel can have bigger signage directing people to this better toilet, seems underutilised.

Level 2 toilet at the sports hall: ok sized, clean. Also needs more signage around level 2 outside the sports hall to direct people to the toilet inside.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104669702910752855038/reviews
D. Lundy,5,Large and open aired space with lots of options for the whole family for activities. We were impressed by the size of the swimming facilities. This was despite the slides and play pool being out of action while undertaking maintenance and remedial works. Hundreds of people may attend so there is significant capacity for the community,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104708171987080461195/reviews
