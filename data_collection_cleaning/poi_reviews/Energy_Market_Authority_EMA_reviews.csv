Alan Tang,1,"We are a small family business and our monthly electrical bill has shot up from $1200.00 to more than $4000.

This is because EMA gave out the electricity retailer licenses without stringent criteria and standards.

This led to a many of them bailing out at the sight of seeing red immediately.

EMA’s underling SP said that we are not to worry as the SOP is for the exiting retailers to pass our contracts on to the remaining pool of retailers in the business.

However none of the incumbent retailers are willing to take us in and we were like orphans.

The next best step was SP taking us in and this led to a huge price jump from our previously fixed rate of 19 to 68 cents per KWH.

We were offered TRECS, a temporary electrical contract to keep the prices low but it was quickly closed to new registrations to due overwhelming response.

Our COVID-19 battered business was given another banana skin with this unreasonable electrical pricing, three times our usual rate.

We emailed EMA (SP asked us to do so as they told us that EMA calls the shots and they couldn’t do much) to our surprise they don’t even have a hotline to call in, just an email form.

Nevertheless we emailed them and received an generic reply saying they have been facing gas pressure issues in Sumatra and other factors which lead to the price jump.

We were fed up so we reported this to SPH Chinese papers. The reporters asked us many questions and we gave them copies of the bill as evidence.

However this lead to nothing, as they didn’t report it on the papers and the following week CNA reported EMA has done a lot of work to help those consumers in trouble.

This is ridiculous and the suppression of this news reporting on the troubled SME companies who are paying triple the usual electrical bill is plainly sad.

The silence is deafening.

Everyday our business is suffering and our Singaporean workers who are loyal and hardworking are on the verge of losing their rice bowls.

Why do we have to suffer the consequences because EMA was the responsible party in creating this mess?
