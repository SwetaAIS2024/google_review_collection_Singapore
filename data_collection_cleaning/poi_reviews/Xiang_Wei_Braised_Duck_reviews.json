      "text": "This is best braise duck and Kuay Chap in the region. $4.50 kuay chap one pax set is affordable and compared to others it has very nice aroma from the spices added. The braise pork belly, intestines, bean curd are all well braised to the right texture and flavor, I always add more bean curd so that I can enjoy more. The couple takes pride in their stall and food and are friendly in an old school kampung way. I always treat my friends to this when we are around the area. üëçüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è",

As though the duck died a painful death.\n3. Soup broth don‚Äôt have the strong herbal aroma.\n\nHave a try over at Sims market Hollywood duck. Then you will know where your standard is & improve further on your culinary.",
