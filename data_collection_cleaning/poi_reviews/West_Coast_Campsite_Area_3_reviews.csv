Unesom,1,Too noisy… there are people who have been singing karaoke for 2hours and it’s almost midnight now. Very loud. All I wanted was one night of peaceful camping in nature  …,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102094323850201408088/reviews
lejen_dary,4,Honestly didn’t expect West Coast Park to improve so much! Super near to Mcdonald’s and can ride a bicycle to Sheng Shiong or open air market nearby! Toilet a bit stinky. If there’s more open spaces would be better. Can be quite noisy since many facilities nearby (even midnight).,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104141271997906545781/reviews
Forest BK,5,"Great place to camp.
In the day, it's not hot.
Shady under the tall trees.
At night, breezy by the sea front.
Amazing sunset view by the sea.
A sand pit playground is within eyeshot from campsite.
Very close to the toilet that even has shower facilities.
McDonald's is just a stone throw away, and is open 24 hrs.
And should you need more, Sheng Siong West Coast is close by.
The camp site is at high ground, so rain water wouldn't stay up.
Nice!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Joel,3,"Just a large patch of grass where you can pitch your tent. Conveniently, it is right next to the toilet. Definitely the weaker among the various campsites in Singapore as it really is just a field. East Coast Park has a more cooling and relaxing seaside atmosphere, Pasir Ris Park for the ulu vibes, or the islands for the different experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106648965741991058952/reviews
