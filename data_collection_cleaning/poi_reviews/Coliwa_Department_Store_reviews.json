      "text": "Food is generally good BUT the pigeon management is really disappointing. Even though attempts to scare away pigeons through dummy paper crows were introduced, the pigeons are way smarter then what the management thinks they are. To be more concise, they're useless in addressing the issue. Pigeons are seen aggressively flying across tables and leftover cutlery, poking through the legs of customers and even giving tables and customers their heavenly droppings from the overhanging pipes. (See Pic) Perhaps if the management is able to adopt more effective \"anti- pigeon\" measures by enclosing all open areas with safety nets (like the those implemented at Bishan Bus Interchange Hawker Centre), dining at Chinatown Food Complex will be a much more hygienic and pleasant experience.",

OMG the worst and most ridiculous pig trotters I every had! Visit at your own risk!\nThe Chendol store run by an old lady is nice though, $2 per bowl serve on a retro bowl.\nThen again, as mentioned ... becoming too touristy and expensive price with generally lower food standard already.",
