Olivia LZ,3,"Every end of the month, we have a little tradition—meeting up with friends at our favorite BBQ place.
It’s not just about the food (though the grilled meats and dipping sauces are amazing), it’s about catching up, laughing, and unwinding after a long month.
The familiar sizzle, the shared plates, and the stories we exchange around the table make it something we always look forward to.
No matter how busy life gets, BBQ brings us back together.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111575454013833516207/reviews
GC Khor,4,"Reached the place around 12.25pm this afternoon. The place is crowded and was informed to pay first before the service staff directed us to a table and set up the bbq. The buffet counter includes meat stuff like pork, beef, chicken and seafood like sotong, prawns and others like luncheon meat, endoki mushroom, lettuce, pickled raddish, kimchi, etc. Various sauces like special chilli sauce, korean sauce, ketchup, etc are also provided. There is kimchi soup and kelp soup, cut fruit watermelon and a small section of fried food like fried fish dory, fries, fried chicken, fried dumpling. However, the fried food are cold. Drink section included a variety of cold drinks like barley, lemon, orange, etc. Overall, food is satisfactory considering the price is reasonable at $18 per person for weekday lunch. Price is $22 for dinners, weekends and public holiday. There is no time limit for the buffets.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114518929840898681884/reviews
Tricia T,4,"Visited on 2nd Jan 2025 weekday dinner. Not sure if pricing has changed but we paid 22/adult and 10/child (4 years). There's sufficient variety of food. Food quality is average/poor (can see some of the meats semi cooked, probably from defrosting?) It's hit and miss. The other items are okay, reasonable for the pricing. Okay to visit again, not missing much not to.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102603324946498371745/reviews
Lai Kuan Pan,5,"Overall experience is good. Foods always refill before empty. Slowly enjoying the bbq. Enjoy eating.  Interesting, have pickle papaya. Good to eat with wrap vege with meat. Ssamjang paste can be thicker. If the pork belly meat can be thicker, that's will be great.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106098225967002483670/reviews

Variety is ok.

Limited tables so gotta go early.

Staff are very courteous and friendly

Overall, it’s a highly recommended spot for anyone looking to enjoy a simple yet flavorful meal. I’ll definitely be returning!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105969948223512649694/reviews
