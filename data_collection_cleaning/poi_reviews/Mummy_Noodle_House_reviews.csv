Daniel Lim,5,"Khao Soi Gai is pretty hard to find in SG; it's my favourite nothern thai dish. This is where I come for my fix.

It's good. Rich flavour, succulent chicken. Quite delicious, and I'm glad this stall is a bus ride away from me. Note the opening hours. It's mainly a lunch spot.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108134641680568122019/reviews
