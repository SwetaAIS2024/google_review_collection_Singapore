      "text": "A bread shop with unique experience where they serve waffle on a plate with cutlery when dine in to eat the waffles instead of the traditional way take and eat. The waffle is cheaper than traditional waffle costs $1.50 for 2 slices with a few choices of filling. We opt for the peanut butter filling and kaya filling but size is smaller. Their peanut butter is those lava and thick texture which I like. However I feel the waffle have no flavour on it own and nothing special. Also order their honey lemon $3 and decent ok only. There also a lot of old school fruit tart and cakes at a reasonable price as well as kaya toast with eggs and kopi to go with.",

      "text": "Very heartland outlet at the ground floor of an HDB block. The whole area felt like a mini village imho.\n\nit’s actually the first bakery I’ve seen so far that had dining tables (although only 3) outside to let customers enjoy freshly made waffles, toasted bread and hot drinks on site.\n\nFood wise, it was simple but with a home cooked vibe. Prices way cheaper than all local cafe chains and you can pay with CDC vouchers too!\n\nWill be back to try the waffles next time!",

Also the aunties are friendly too",
