If you are seeking help with mental issues, do not hesitate to a book an appointment with him. I'm certain that you'll find the help that you need.\n\nCounter staff Joanne was warm and kind as well, she will call to confirm your next appointment.\n\nThe prices of the services offered are very much in line with market prices in the private sector.\n\nDefinitely would recommend, 10/10.\n\nThanks so much to Dr Lee and the staffs at The Psychological Wellness Centre. Thanks for doing God's work!",
