      "text": "Really a hidden gem that I finally got to try. As a self-professed handmade fishball noodles fan, I would say this definitely caught my attention. When the noodles arrived, the portion looked generous and the ingredients clearly handmade. The fishballs were on the chewy side, with more bite than I expected. My personal preference was for a smoother and more tender type of fishballs, so this was slightly unexpected. However, I would still definitely recommend this place as on the overall, this bowl of noodles is hearty, and one hell of a flavour bomb.",

If I visit this noodles shop again, I will request lesser pork lard in my fish ball soup as it really makes the soup very oily. By the way, the soup was tasty without the pork lard ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š",
