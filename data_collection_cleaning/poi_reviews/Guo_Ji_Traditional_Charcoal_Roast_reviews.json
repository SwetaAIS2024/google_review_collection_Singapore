The accompanying sauce was balanced and complemented well.\n\nPricing is reasonable for its quality and portion.",

Very flavorful pork belly\n\nSoup. Sweet more than savory but works.\n\nRice and sauce. Sweet sauce and hardness of the rice was just right (on the harder side)\n\nCon\nToughness of meat. Both duck and pork are really not tender. Luckily pork was fatty and duck was thinly sliced.",
