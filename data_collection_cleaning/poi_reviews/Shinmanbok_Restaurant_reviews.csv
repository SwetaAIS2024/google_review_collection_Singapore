Yong T K,4,Always love to come here for the kbbq buffet experience. Their meats are generally good with several cooked food dishes that comes with their buffet. Special mention to their beef brisket which we ordered several times as they were succulent and tender.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102555756266066569509/reviews

theo teddy,3,"Ordered the beef set ($105) but didn‚Äôt expect that they are frozen meat (same standard as those buffet type) and not the fresh ones that I usually get for this price set. They ‚Äúcook‚Äù for you but more like putting as much meat as possible in the grill. Side dish ok, soup and cheese pizza are not tasty. Overall not bad but there are definitely better Korean bbq at same price level along the same street. Will not revisit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107296818559564069821/reviews
Nicole Yeung,4,"Establishment is clean and air con keeps the place cool - too cold for me actually üòÖ but not a problem when the BBQ is on.

The dishes are quite pricey and prices have gone up from previous ones. Though the pork belly portion of looked small, 2 players was enough for 2 of us girls to get full.

Service is good, our server cooked and served all out meat. Free side dishes - 5 plates. The ssamjang (spicy sauce) wasn't spicy at all though.

Pricey plates of pork $25 each. And there's tax + service charge added in Singapore so it'll end up being even more than you thought.

Should you go here? Yeah good late night Korean spot especially after drinking.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104376997712637000762/reviews
Jo L,5,"We liked the pork belly and beef brisket the most. The buffet comes with a lot of other things so it's worth it. But only the meats are refillable, the kimchi pancake, chicken, egg etc is just one-off. The fried chicken was tasteless, I will avoid getting it next time.

The male staff were quite cold and unfriendly but there's this woman who was quite nice.

You can also get a small yogurt drink like Yakult after the meal. I will come back again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110213543929094512296/reviews
