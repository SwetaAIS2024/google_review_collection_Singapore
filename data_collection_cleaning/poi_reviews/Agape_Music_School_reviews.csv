Tong Vivian,5,"My elder boy has been with the school since 5 years ago and l enrolled my younger boy 3 years ago when he was 5 years old. I am very impressed with Ms Catherina, who is the school principal. She has always been very patient and knows how to handle small children. My boy enjoys his classes very much and will take the initiative to practice. Sometimes all you need is a good teacher. Thank you, Ms Catherina.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105065497359828255554/reviews
