Phil Knight,5,"I was so pleased with the service at this small shop. It's on the 9th floor and is nestled amongst some industrial outlets. My son's micro scooter was totally refurbished with new brakes, back wheels, and handle grips. There are a wide range of accessories as well. Not too expensive and well worth the taxi journey.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113779355048794521150/reviews
