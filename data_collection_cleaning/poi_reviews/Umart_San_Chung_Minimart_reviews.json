Scummy shop DO NOT SUPPORT SUCH SHOPS. No sign whatsoever, and she even expected me to know there would be a surcharge.",

I brought back and talked to the counter auntie then she shouted to the staff said, it’s 2nd pack that customer return. I asked for refund but the auntie refused and asked me to exchange. I had no mood to continue buying anything from the store. But she gave me the excuse s “GST Keyes in, can’t refund.” It’s nonsense. They did wrong and still refuse to satisfied customer s request. It’s really bad!",
