Ezzy Chan,5,"Imagine a bowl of 小碗麵 (small bowl noodles) that is a delightful symphony of flavors and textures. The al dente noodles are perfectly cooked, offering a satisfying bite with each mouthful. The tender pork slices, marinated in chili and vinegar, bring a balance of heat and tang that dances on your palate. The addition of a soft-boiled egg adds a rich, creamy element, blending seamlessly with the broth and noodles. And to top it all off, the fresh prawn introduces a sweet, succulent note, complementing the savory depth of the dish. Each ingredient harmonizes to create a delicious and memorable experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116781062699288858567/reviews
Darren Ng,1,"We visited with high expectations for a good dinner but were disappointed by the food.

Paying $7–$8 for a bowl of noodles by the roadside, amidst dust and heat, simply wasn’t worth it. The half-cooked spaghetti with baked chicken was terrible, while the mini pot noodle and minced meat noodle were mediocre at best—far inferior to what you’d find at Bendemeer Market.

Unfortunately, this was a one-time visit for us. We won’t be returning.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108676030645125230505/reviews
Eric Chng,4,"Good place to have noodles, prices are quite reasonable ($6.80), and 5.50 if you just take the ba chor mee without mini wok.  Had the mini wok and it came with a large fresh prawn, which was nice. Ingredients were fairly generous. Noodles quantity was so so but sufficient for an average eater. Not very accessible but ok for those who drive.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100480067989326525096/reviews
