Quite convenient to go to Great World City and a nearby school from here. Unfortunately, some exits that are easily assessable to Great World City is still under renovation! I am fine with that‚Ä¶ Also this places is near Orchard but ironically it is far from Orchard. Before this station was opened, we have to get here by bus by far the best. I feel good that they opened this MRT station!!ü§™üòÅ Quite nearby some condominiums found in the vicinity!üòÉ",

An exit to Great World has since opened for a while, but they are currently building an exit to a overhead bridge that enters great world shopping mall.\nIt is nearly complete at the time of posting. Could have opened an exit closer to the nearby River Valley Primary School. Otherwise very good. Also after school (1.30pm) please expect Cheers to be crowded with schoolchildren.",
