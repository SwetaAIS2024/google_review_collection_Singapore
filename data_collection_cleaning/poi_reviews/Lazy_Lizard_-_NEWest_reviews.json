      "text": "Have been here before without giving review although everything was great. We came again for a late lunch (or early dinner) on a quiet weekday since they have now a 50% off after 3pm for all dishes on pizza, risotto, pasta, main and burger. At first we thought the offered dishes will be some downsized version but they were actually a full normal size and taste too ðŸ˜Š\n\nSo we had a bulgogi iberico pizza and a rack of pork. The pizza was as great as the truffle salami we had for dinner before. Crispy thin crush, full of flavorful ingredients with a hint of spiciness. Substantial of melted cheese, so it was quite rich as a whole. We managed only to eat 3 out out 8 slides but happily to take home the rest. The rack of pork was also excellent. A thick piece of tendered and well marinated pork, came with lots of mashed potatoes topped with saute mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. The meat was perfectly cooked and the mushroom source matched it very well. Again it was rather rich and we would wish it came with some green salads instead although the mashed potato was really good too.\n\nOverall superb meal with a great ambient. Also we must mention the abundant friendliness and cheerfulness of the serving staff. Will certainly come again many times",

So itâ€™s crusty yet so tender in the middle. You never knew pork can taste like that. The service is always top notch and nice atmosphere too. I highly recommend to come for lunch as you can pay for the main and get soup, drink and dessert for free.",

Staff very attentive too.\n\nOnly thing is put some lower seating outside - not everyone can tahan high stools and table. Put some of this inside too ðŸ˜Ž",
