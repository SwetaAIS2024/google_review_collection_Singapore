      "text": "Was browsing around when I came across this shop.  Saw a couple of folks eating so I decided to give it a try.  I am fan of mee kia dry noodles and eating the ah Lim mee pok and art of mee pok at Simpang Bedok raises my expectations of this dish.\nI was pleasantly surprised at the dish.  The noodles were well prepared, though I believe I should have ordered the mee pok if I expected more bite in the noodles.  Well blend of sauce,chilli, vinegar and fried garlic.  What was most impressive however was the mince pork and think pork slices. I usually ask hawkers not to include the pork slices as I don‚Äôt really like the texture and smell, but this was surprisingly tender and fresh!  The soup had a nice herbal taste to it !  I‚Äôd dare say the soup trumps the 2 stalls i mentioned above.\nSuper recommended üëç\nWould have given them a 5 star if the fishball was better.",

Now you even skimp on the sauce of the dry mee. Tasteless! Only one thing has increase from that constantly, the price. Other than that, food quality, ingredients, standard has all degraded. This is my first time giving them feedback here and also my last time patronising their stall. Its fine to increase price as needed but your food standard has also deteriorate continuously throughout the years, thats very saddening! But I dont think the boss cares anyway.",
