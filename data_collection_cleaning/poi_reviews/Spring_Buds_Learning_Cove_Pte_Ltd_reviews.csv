Ailin P,5,"I have enrolled my son to several preschools around the region, even willing to venture out to marsiling region.
Spring buds is his 4th preschool.

He stayed in this school when spring buds took over early last year. My son was at k2 last year,  and naturally I was very anxious, worried about changes and new school taking over the compound. I was reassured by my friend who shared spring buds has a branch in sembawang and it is very popular.

The current school is newly renovated, very brightly lit, has clean and airy interior, and a fun playground!

They have multiple in class programs from external vendors e.g. Dance, arts, sports and my children have benefitted deeply. School fees is reasonable given all these programs.

Importantly, the teachers truly care and love the children. They organised fun and bonding activities e.g. Graduation overnight camp, Halloween parties, for the children.
I thoroughly appreciated the frequent updates by teachers as well.
My eldest is in p1 now and has adapted well so far. He has grown to be more confident as an individual and had the opportunities to explore and develop his interests in arts and dance etc.

This is definitely by far the best preschool we have been to ðŸ˜Š",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116205704666772709118/reviews
