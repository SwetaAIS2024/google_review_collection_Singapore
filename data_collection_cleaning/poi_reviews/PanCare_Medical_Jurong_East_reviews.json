      "text": "My first visit! I was very pleasantly surprised when I entered the clinic because there were many cute little figurines. Dr Samuel Chan performed a thorough assessment without rushing through at all. He was patient in gathering information from me and made sure to not prescribe medication I already have at home. The overall bill was very reasonable and significantly cheaper than the clinic I used to visit. As Dr Samuel knew about my work with children with special needs, he also found out more about it (e.g., referral process) as it might benefit another client of his. Definitely a doctor who goes the extra mile. I'm really glad there are doctors like Dr Samuel who is patient, thoughtful, warm and highly professional.",

      "text": "Visited a week ago last Saturday for a UTI and was attended to by a doctor who said she wasn't the main doctor in the clinic. (Can't recall her name.) After doing a urine test, I was told I had only a mild infection and was prescribed just one single dosage of antibiotics.\n\nI thought this was weird, because from what I read online, UTIs require a few days of antibiotics to be treated, but hey, I'm not a doctor, and we all know not to trust what we read online.\n\nAlthough symptoms subsided after a day, they returned after a few days. I thought I could treat it at home by drinking lots of water to flush out the bacteria, but it only worsened.\n\nUpon visiting the polyclinic today and doing another urine test, I was told I had a very high infection count and the doctor even wanted to send the urine sample for further analysis. This time I was prescribed a week's of antibiotics.\n\nI couldn't help feel and think that I could've avoided the UTI progressing to a more serious stage (and thus a lot of frustration and discomfort) if I had been prescribed with adequate treatment during my first consultation at PanCare Medical Jurong East. The one single dosage of antibiotics also cost me $20, but it's more the issue with what I perceive as receiving inadequate medication to begin with that prompts me to leave this review, especially when I had trusted this clinic with my health after reading many positive reviews here.",
