Henry Chua,5,"Consulted Doctor Yap for renewal of my driver's license checkup at age 65. He is highly recommended. No qualms and soft spoken but humanistic doctor. The charges is cheapest in town at $18 for this type of checks.
Evening crowd quite ok, but good to go early and queue. Opens at 645pm except Wednesday, Friday and Saturday and Public holiday night is close.
Asked the Nurse at duty, very friendly and kind with very good service as I checked how to get to mayflower mrt and she guided me. She even call me to check if I managed to find the station.
I believe not many clinics in Singapore provide this wonderful warmth human service.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109059542215227940718/reviews
Yatie Ezat,2,"Disappointed with this clinic. Google says close at 4.30pm, but only 4.10pm they not taking anymore patients, there was no patient at that time too. I came all the way from macpherson and it was really urgent i needed just the itchy whole body injection but was turned down. I came down yesterday too, clinic was closed. All staff and docter rushing to go home, no mercy for patients. Really disappointed.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104085515495227195864/reviews
Imel Claudia,5,"Dr. Yap is incredibly knowledgeable and took the time to answer all my questions.
Dr. Yap very patient Doctor that I ever met , he is  very friendly and also down to earth.
Highly recommend!!!.

Dr. Yap has been my family doctor, Iâ€™ve always look for him and his medicine just work for me and my family.
Not only that the two of Dr. Yap staff also very clear in explaining regards on the medicine.

Fees are very reasonable, and I totally disagree for those patient said that Dr. Yap service are bad.

Dr. Yap is the best doctor!
Thank you Dr. Yap!!!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102661830308618160338/reviews
May Goh,5,"Doctor Yap is careful and detail. The clinic is run very efficiently. Once am done with dr, i did not need to wait more than 5 minutes for my medicine. Very fast and nice service from registration to dispensing medicine. The only thing is its super crowded most of the time .",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110412438635622067277/reviews
