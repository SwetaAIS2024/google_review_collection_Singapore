jayden,4,"Thin crust classified chicken as all time favourites of mine and my family!
Tried the Hawaiian pizza with hand tossed variation this time round too and isn't as expected, it's quite doughy and you can taste the doughy taste too on the crust.
Will still opt for thin crust which I guess it's their signature variation for all flavours.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews

H S,5,"I accidentally ordered the same pizza twice through the app, so I called the outlet to correct my mistake. The lady who answered was super helpful and managed to change my order to what I originally wanted. She also informed me that there might be a slight delay since the food was already being prepared. Even with the last-minute change, the pizza arrived quickly and was still hot. And most importantly, it tasted absolutely delicious! Great service and fantastic pizza!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104359964484499915920/reviews
Addy Low,1,"Hi Domino Team, I encountered the same situation too! We placed the order yesterday at 5.54pm to Domino Pizza at Bedok Reservoir Outlet through food panda app, which delivery will be handled by your Domino rider.

We waited for 3 to 4 hours and our order still not yet delivered to us!!!

Despite we have tried to make several calls to your outlet to check on our order delivery status but keep no one answered the phone and yet still hang up the call.

This morning I checked my Domino order status again, the order is still showing ""being prepared"" since last evening.

And right now, I saw my order was updated as ""Delivered"", so where is my food now?!!

This is very disappointing! As well of your bad customer service and delivery.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100955743107900540340/reviews
Kah Wang Tan,1,"We ordered 1.5 hours before the required delivery time which is for 6pm but when it’s 6pm, the live pizza tracker states to “rate the service” meaning that the food has been delivered. Made a call to the outlet and the person said our food is ready but they have to wait for the delivery guy to come pick up.

As I felt it will take hours for that, I drove down to collect it myself and I think there was still lots of orders not being collected and delivered. I think the delivery issue has to be sorted out here else don’t bother putting delivery option.

Due to that, our pizza was cold. I think another thing to note was one of the staffs baking the pizza didn’t even wear mask and she was talking to her colleagues.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117624172714283499367/reviews
