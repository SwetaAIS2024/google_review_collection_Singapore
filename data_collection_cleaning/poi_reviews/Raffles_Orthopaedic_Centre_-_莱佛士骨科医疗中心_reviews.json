I was shocked and asked why didn‚Äôt they call to inform me, because I took time off from work to specially head down to Bugis (I stay at the west) for the appointment. The receptionist replied ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt call us to inform that you‚Äôre late‚Äù. Really extremely horrible service and they don‚Äôt seem the least bit apologetic at all. writing this review in hopes that people can save their time and money and go to another specialist instead.",

      "text": "Very Bad experience! I was told my MRI appointment was 4.30pm and I arrived at 4.05pm to make payment for my MRI. I was then asked to go to level 1. I waited at Clinic for 50mins and when approached the counter then I was told tat my scan was actually scheduled for 5.20pm instead. My sms message reminder indicated that it was 4.45pm. The nurse at L12 Michelle, didn‚Äôt even mention the MRI time when I was there early to make payment. So I asked for a refund, and the other nurse there, Aileen was very rude! I asked for a copy of the receipt that I had originally paid for. She say she cannot give me a copy as it was void. I only wanted a photocopy for cross reference in case my card was still charged. She juz threw the copy on the table in front of me and said ‚Äúyou can take this!‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt give a single star here if not for the fact that it was mandatory!",
