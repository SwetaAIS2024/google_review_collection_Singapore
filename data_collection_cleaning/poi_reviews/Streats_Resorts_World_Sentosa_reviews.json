      "text": "Ambience is casual.  However, the taste of the food is below expectation. The crispy silver fish is not crispy but soggy. Look at the layer of oil in the bowl of the claypot curry chicken (see photo attached). I have to ask the restaurant manager to take a look herself and she brought it back to the kitchen to \"rectify\" it. Even so, there was still a layer that remains. Lastly on terms of service, do not expect much either. You will be surprised that the McDonald's downstairs provides a better experience.",

Clean environment and friendly & welcoming staffs. An array of foods to be chosen great for family & friends outing. Pictures speak for the foods.\nOverall positive experience and would come back for more!",

The beverages were delicious.\n\nThe only reason I couldn't give this place a fifth star is upon reflecting on the service, as it seems to be in a growing majority of the retail and hospitality industry in Singapore, was sub par.\n\nThe restaurant has its own method of ordering food where you fill out a docket of sorts once you have chosen from the vast selection of options off their menu. We were never told this. Had to figure it out ourselves.\n\nThat aside I found staff unwilling to engage with their guests. Simple things such as checking if we're happy with our meals or if we needed anything, would have gone a long way.",
