yowe ko,1,"Been to the clinic for the 2nd time for appointment with Dr Tan and encountered this incident.

I arrived on time for my appointment and I was told by the nurse to wait for my turn to see him.

After waiting for a while, I stand up and ask the nurse when it’s my turn to see Dr Tan and she told me Dr Tan was unable to see me due to a sudden meeting.

The funny thing is there’s a guy who came after me was able to see Dr Tan and I couldn’t.
Then I realised this nurse lied to me that Dr Tan had a sudden meeting and she asked me to rearrange another appointment with Dr Tan because she let the another guy in.

This is how they operate their business and they don’t mind losing me as their patient because they have so many patients everyday.

I am writing this incident for you all to know how bad this clinic was and I hope it doesn’t happen to you.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107559191830621084383/reviews
