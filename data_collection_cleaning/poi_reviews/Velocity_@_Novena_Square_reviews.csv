Eve C,3,"Mall has been around for a while. A good neighbourhood mall with F&B choices. Popular because it is in proximity to Mt E hospital and Tan Tock Seng. Come here for basic amenity. It is marketed as a sports centric offering mall but the offering has reduced from its heyday.

Conveniently connected to Novena MRT.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,This mall has been around for a long time and is still thriving after all these years! Love that it is conveniently located right above Novena MRT on the North South Line. Walking distance from other malls too with shelter nearby. Lots of eateries here as well as sports shops. Will be back!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
