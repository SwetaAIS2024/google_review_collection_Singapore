Alvin Choo,4,"It's been years since I visited Rangooli. My first visit was actually when they were still located near Ayer Rajah market, and I made sporadic visits over the years.

It seemed as though they refreshed their menu recently, and we wanted something different for dinner, hence the visit.

Food was generally okay. My only gripe was the extremely long menu which resulted in decision paralysis. It would be good if they could put together a set meal or tasting menu that would showcase the must eats and make it easier for customers who are new to Indian Cuisine.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
Anson,5,"The food is competitively priced compared to other North Indian restaurants in Singapore. The taste is quite good and overall satisfying. The masala tea has a strong cardamom flavour, which adds a nice touch. The mango lassi is well balanced and refreshing.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114273645796500296674/reviews
Praveen V,5,Butter chicken and garlic naan was fantastic. Mutton biryani was alright though I would've preferred it to be a little more spicy. Prices are also reasonable for the quality and portions.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101707825146987791228/reviews

Luca Hambleton,5,"My favourite Indian restaurant in Singapore. Chefs and staff work tirelessly, and rarely close on any holiday, so chances are you can come here any day!
Food here is top notch and I’ve never complained in the many years I have come. I’ve always advocated for the butter chicken, dal and especially the naan here.
Place will be busier in the evening, make sure you come a bit early to miss that. A lot of people I have seen online complain about service when the place does not have too much staff. But I’ve never had these issues, apart from big parties or birthdays being held there once or twice.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105644160259448545996/reviews
