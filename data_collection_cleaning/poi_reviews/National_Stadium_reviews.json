The stadium is spacious, well-designed, and features a retractable roof and a cooling system, making it comfortable even during large crowds.\n\nGetting there is very convenient with Stadium MRT station located nearby. The surroundings, including Kallang Wave Mall, add to the convenience with plenty of dining and shopping options.\n\nThe atmosphere inside the stadium is energetic and lively, making events here very enjoyable. However, food options inside can be quite limited and pricey, and thereâ€™s a strict no re-entry policy that some may find inconvenient.\n\nOverall, it's a fantastic venue for a big event, with great accessibility and a vibrant environment.",

When people stands on the tribune sides and jump, itâ€™s a bit bouncy. Idk its a good thing or no? I mean in a safety perspective.
