Chloe Wam,5,"Best Thai food at affordable price. Portion is huge. The mixed vegetables brought me directly back to bkk street. Tried a few others such as garlic pork, garlic chicken, pad thai, kang Kung, po piah.. all yummy! Strongly recommend!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104774918595957492726/reviews
Andy Lee,3,Ok Thai food. The garlic pork was a bit salty for me. Pineapple rice decent.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113937067165127510810/reviews
Ziyi Cheng,4,"Affordable pricing, generous portions and tasty food.

Glad to have found this gem in a food court. Seems pretty popular with families as it‚Äôs easy to order a few dishes to share. Average pricing was about $7.

We each got our own mains and shared a tom yam soup. Everything tasted decent for its price point and however, the tom yam soup tastes slightly different (in a good way) to the usual ones. It has a slow burn effect, i.e you feel the warmth in your tummyüå∂Ô∏è

Highly recommend if you‚Äôre around the area!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108241116805388403298/reviews
