      "text": "I have been with QSO for more than a year as a flutist playing interesting and well arranged compositions.\nTime at QSO is enjoyable and meaningful as I continue to grow and benefit from the practice sessions.\nThe orchestra has a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. It is heartening to see instrumentalists of different levels  working together, improve their skills and orchestral musicianship. The repertoire has a mix of classical, game sound tracks , movie themes etc., some easy others more challenging. It is an accomplishment that we have performed  Bach's Violin concerto in E major, Mozart Trio, Areith Theme , the jazzy Citlalis Home at our concerts.\nCredit goes to Edwin the music director's leadership and dedication in guiding the orchestra and arranging the music. He tailors the scores according to the player's skill. Patiently he helps the group handle tricky or more complex rhythmic passages , encourages and builds the player's confidence.\nOur QSO president, Reuben who is proactive, people oriented, holds an important supportive role managing the administrative tasks.\nFinally not forgetting our fellow musicians whose harmonious collaborative team effort helps make this orchestra a successful community project. Cheers!",

      "text": "Under the guidance of Mr. Edwin from Quindicesima Music Academy (QMA), my boy made remarkable progress within just a few months. Mr. Edwin‚Äôs patience and keen eye for detail have been invaluable. He quickly identifies mistakes and corrects them on the spot, helping my son refine his technique and develop greater musical sensitivity.\n\nTo further enrich his musical experience, he participates in occasional orchestra training with QMA, which helps him improve his rhythm, timing, and ability to play in an ensemble. Being part of a group setting has also enhanced his confidence and listening skills.\n\nIn 2024, he took up the clarinet as his second instrument, adding a new dimension to his musical journey. Learning both piano and clarinet has broadened his understanding of music theory and expression. I truly believe he enjoys every lesson, embracing each challenge with enthusiasm and dedication, and finding joy in every note he plays.",

      "text": "Attended a first session last week to try learning the violin by QSO. The music school and community orchestra is run in a very accessible manner and cost. The experience for the first lesson by Edwin and the administration by Reuben were excellent - relaxed, informative and encouraging. I would definitely recommend for adult learners and those who are interested to embark on a learning journey and be part of the community.",

      "text": "I recently had the privilege of playing with this incredible orchestra, and my experience was nothing short of fantastic. It is a good place for me who had just started out playing the clarinet and wanted to play together with a group. From the moment I joined the group, I felt welcomed and inspired by the group of people around me. The time spent rehearsing was productive and enjoyable, with each session pushing me to grow as a musician and as a clarinet player.\n\nAs a music group that does not require auditions and having a range of players, the scores were tailored by our music director to the different levels of each and every one of us. I also feel like I have grown and improved in my playing since the moment I joined this orchestra. The scores we performed were a perfect mix of challenging and rewarding, especially the beautiful game soundtracks. As a clarinet player, I was deeply immersed in the music, tackling some intricate parts that really tested my technical abilities and expressive range. The opportunity to perform such beautiful and complex pieces was truly fulfilling.\n\nA special mention must go to the director, whose leadership was absolutely outstanding. Their clear vision, attention to detail, and passion for the music elevated the entire orchestra. Under their guidance, each rehearsal felt purposeful, and every performance was a shared effort toward perfection. They truly brought the music to life, making the entire experience even more memorable.\n\nI also appreciate the professionalism regarding the instrument rental. As a clarinet player who then moved on to play the bass clarinet, I did not have my own but the music director kindly lent me his to broaden my musical horizons and to play the bass clarinet with the orchestra. It's clear that the orchestra takes great care in ensuring all musicians have access to the tools they need to perform at their best.\n\nIn summary, this is an exceptional experience that I would highly recommend to any musician looking to challenge themselves and be part of a fantastic and inclusive musical community. The attention to detail, the music, and the leadership make this orchestra a top-tier experience. I'm already looking forward to the next opportunity to perform with this amazing group!",
