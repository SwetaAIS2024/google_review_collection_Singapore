      "text": "I have the privilege of staying in the Villa Frangipani for a week. This stupendous Villa is built in a half acre of land. It's a 2 storey building and the designer and creator, Aileen Tan, has a total open concept that allows easy movement of ventilation. The chandeliers are specially made of stained glass that gives of an air of holiness and opulence. At night when the whole house is lighted up, it's so beautiful, and it's nickname, the house of light. I will never forget the time that I enjoyed staying here.",

      "text": "The hosts were beyond our wildest expectations! From the moment you step foot in the property, you are greeted with such impeccable hospitality, one inadvertently goes on wondering, “what more than a comfortable home away from home?”  A wide host of food choices, an even wider variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables.\n\nTo top the expectations, be sure to ask for the seasonal Bar Tender! Too much to ask of from Any One Gracious host(s). You are guaranteed not to be disappointed.\n\nOnly once you have sampled this delightable  experience the hosts have to offer, one could only dream of longing for more; be it the surrounding sights, beautiful melodies of bird songs throughout the day and night in harmonious concert with flora, fauna and insect songs or be it the exquisite planning, open architecture and furnishing tastes of these property owners.\n\nIt’s an experience of a life time, unexpectedly in a hidden gem of this tropical hideout. Pamper your thoughts, bodies and souls. This is a once-in-a-lifetime-experience.\n\nAs if we were not already satisfied and pampered enough during our stay at this property and location, we were told just before departure, one could even book their own Chef of based off their pallet and even a Deejay to tailor to your occasion and theme however elaborate or personal\n\nWhat????!!!!\n\nWe were mind blown. Period.\n\nWe just booked our next gateway with them a few years in advanced.\n\nToo good to be true?\n\nWe dare you indulge!\n\nThis might sound unrealistically incredible but, truly and with these couple as hosts, you definitely have nothing else to do other than Indulge and  Experience because you’re never turning back.",
