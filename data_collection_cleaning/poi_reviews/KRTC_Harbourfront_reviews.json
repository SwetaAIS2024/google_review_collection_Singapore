I truly appreciate her help in handling them so well and tactfully. The way she was interacting with the boys has make learning so interesting. Her expertise in teaching has put my mind so much at ease. Teaching my two active boys have always been a challenge to me however teacher Lisa has become their perfect friend and a great teacher to learn from. Thank you for your dedication.",
