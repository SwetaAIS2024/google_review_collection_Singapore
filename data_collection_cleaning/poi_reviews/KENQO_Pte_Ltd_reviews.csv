Joyce Koay,1,"Went down to the shop on 2 separate occasions during their opening hours, Wed and Fri. Both days shop closed even though their website indicate they are open. Called their landlines multiple times on different days also no response. Message the seller on Shoppee also no response. Very poor service and seems like the shop is waiting to close down.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109431211402543255321/reviews
