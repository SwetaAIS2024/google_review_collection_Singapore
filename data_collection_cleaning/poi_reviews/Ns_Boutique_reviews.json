They also held said dress while my indecisive self sorted out what I wanted, which I really appreciated :)",

      "text": "Horrible clothing quality and customer service. Bought a dress for $200++, and washed it individually in light \"handwash\" cycle (15 mins) and cool temperature. By the way, dress had NO CARE LABEL. After washing, it was put away in wardrobe. I tried to wear it 6 months later and to my horror, realise the dress had shrunk way beyond acceptable levels. The dress had shrunk by at least 1 size. When I called their store and office for help, and they gave a very unhelpful and unsympathetic answer : \"our boss says - sorry cannot help\". Did not offer other way to help ease the damage or horrible quality. Appalling customer service standards given how pricey their clothes are. I am never going back.",
