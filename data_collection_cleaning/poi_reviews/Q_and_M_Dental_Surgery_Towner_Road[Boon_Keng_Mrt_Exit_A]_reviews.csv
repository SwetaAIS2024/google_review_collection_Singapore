Adeline Ng,5,"Brought my domestic helper to Towner Branch. It was such a breeze to make appointment via their website and same day respond via phone call by the Towner Branch staff. Prior to appointment day, a whatapp message to inform us the administration details. Staff were friendly and Dr Mervin was kind to explain the procedure to me and my helper. All went well, in and out less than 1 hour.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104805868192139690595/reviews

Tian Yuan Soong,5,"Just moved to this area with family. So, trying out this branch, hoping I can make this my future and long term  dental care services for me and my family. To my surprise, the staff provided a top tier service. Made an appointment online and I received a confirmation call almost immediately. Then I walked in again without knowing it was their lunch time. The receptionist was very kind and assure me that, it was fine to make enquiries. She happily stopped having her lunch and provided all the informations that I needed.

Then comes my appointment day, Dr Amy provided a thorough checkup and advised me accordingly. We proceeded with the cleaning and multiple filling services. She was very gentle throughout the whole process. The staff who assisted her was very helpful. I will bring my children there to see Dr Amy soon.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114449801786350932634/reviews
