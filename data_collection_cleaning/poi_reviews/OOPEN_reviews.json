      "text": "Came for the complementary breakfast buffet and welcome drink at lunchtime.\nBreakfast buffet: Good selections of beverages. Limited choices of Western style, Chinese, Indian, and Japanese food. Crispy Hash brown. Fresh fruits (I like papaya). Not bad for simple breakfast.\nWelcome drinks: different from the beverages station of breakfast buffet. For takeaways or dine in.\nVery busy at the breakfast buffet. So quiet during lunchtime in spite of lunch special promotion.\nService: efficient, prompt. Smiles. Friendly and polite staff. Refill food and clean up very fast. So far, the best service among IBIS hotel's restaurants (compare with Singapore, Japan, and Australia). --- 8/10\nVenue: typical decor. Slightly packed. Clean and tidy. Ourdoors dining is available. TV new during breakfast.",

The pasta was nicely done al dente, It has a light coating of olive oil with a tinge of spicy heat and succulent prawns üëç  The atmosphere is cosy and the service is great too. The service staff is very attentive and prompt.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice place to have a quiet and cosy meal, do drop by their cafe üëç",

There were only 3 prawns in my pasta but the taste is not bad tho. Set lunch comes w a drink. The coffee can do better. Tea seems a better choice w top up of hot water. Go for the eatigo deal. You will not regret it.",
