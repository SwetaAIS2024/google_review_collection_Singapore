Coordination between the staff at the counter and the staffs cooking / preparing the foods can be much better to minimize double and triple checking the orders again by the counter staff.\n\nThe foods are perfect, I have been eating the ribeye steak and grilled chicken set for at least 5 times in the past few weeks and the quality has been very consistent especially the steak, the doneness is always right. Definitely best steak in choa chu kang area especially for this price.",

      "text": "Chose Meet Meat for lunch takeout at Keat Hong Mirage, as it was the highest-rated stall on Google Maps with a 3.5‚Äîmost others were rated even lower. Stall also stood out with its setup and presentation, which gave a good impression.\n\nI tried the Signature Cheese Burger and onion rings. Both were average. The burger portion was decent, but the flavors were didn‚Äôt stand out. The onion rings were meh.\n\nIf you‚Äôre in the area and craving something Western, it‚Äôs a passable option‚Äîbut definitely not something I‚Äôd go out of my way for. Overall, Keat Hong Mirage doesn‚Äôt strike me as a go-to destination for standout food.",

Sides wise, Sweet potato fries, coleslaw and Onion rings are pretty good. Their mac & cheese has a powdery texture which I‚Äôm not quite a fan of.\n\nLava beef burger is great, Patty slightly on the drier side but the cheese makes it better. Will try other stuff again!",
