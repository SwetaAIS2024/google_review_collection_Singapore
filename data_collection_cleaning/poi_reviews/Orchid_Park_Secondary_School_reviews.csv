Tan Tze Hsuen (Opss),5,"I know that i am a students of OPSS.However,OPSS is honestly a really underrated school. Although it is relatively academically poor, the teachers here truly has a passion and deeply care for the students. This school is a mix of fun filled activites and discipline.This school is really strict and stern.However,the school also has really fun activities planned and all the activities are innovative and useful.The sec 1 orientation is made super fun and helpful that i gained quite a lot of friends from it.The maintainence is asko very good the water cooler was broken but unlike my primary school,they fixed it within 1 week!Overall highly reccommend to study here if u want to make some great friends,supportive teachers and awsome memories",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100004522443227999276/reviews
Wyy “Weiyi”,5,"Very underrated school. Strict with discipline, if anything go wrong just find Ms Rebecca (music teacher) not recommended for those who stay far unless you want to wake up earlier ( strict with attendance) Sec 1 orientation is very fun, teacher nice, school layout not that bad. I personally hate that weird shaped staircase tho. Hope you will join OPSS.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108301097176321326373/reviews
Jia Xuan,1,Is this how u teach u student? We never did anything to do them then they copy us and making the bus so noisy. When we look at them they said we side eyes them after that they still yelled at us. What kind of this school students !? One of the girls dare to say “ u stare what stare”. At least one of the girl know that we older than them and called the other girls keep quiet. The other girls still dare to talk back “ older so what “ what kind of manner is this. Is it when they saw elderly looking at them then they still doing the same thing like how they did to us ?! What kind of manners is this ? Pls teach ur students manners !!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106636324031998867477/reviews
