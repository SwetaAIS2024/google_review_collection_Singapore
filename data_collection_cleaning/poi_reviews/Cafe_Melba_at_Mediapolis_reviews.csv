Abraham Lee,4,"Great spot for families. Tons of open space, super kid-friendly, and even has a bouncy castle. There’s both indoor and alfresco seating, a good range of food, and plenty of room for kids to run around (bring a ball or scooter!).

Food was tasty, and the staff were prompt in service. All in, a lovely weekend hangout.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
DaX Toh,4,"Great place for the kids to have a fun and chill time! Has a bouncy castle for the under 10s and next door is a large field and empty space for the kids to run and run. Not too crowded on a weekend which is great. There is room for improvement on the food but otherwise still a decent cafe to hang out. Indoor and outdoor dining options are available and if the weather isn’t too warm, the big bench outside is a great place to be for a big group.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110795556109846185546/reviews
Mark Yeo,4,"Had dinner here again after our last visit several years ago before the pandemic. The food is quite good. Kids loved the fries, and we packed an extra  serving home for them to enjoy. It's a cafe that's casual and friendly and comfortable for young families.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102332048638713474085/reviews
Lina Lim,4,"Crowded with families with kids. Very nice place to hang out. Remember to make reservation before going down. They have alot of reserved  on tables. Each reservation is 2hrs only.

Food is not bad. Brekky burger $22++ is nice. With 2pcs hashbrowns. Yummy.

Truffles fries are nice too. $11++

Kids food items also not bad. With yakult and mini popsicle (apple juice).

Staff tend to forget the items ordered so make sure your items all served before you go counter pay.

BFT members have 15% discount. Not bad~",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107917244728844048910/reviews
Shirley Lim,4,"Was there on a PH and decided to have a quick lunch. Place was quiet, burger was decent. The beef patty was on the smaller side. But the egg was cooked well, yolk oozed out. Their tomato sauce is different from the standard, kinda like a mix between sweet chilli and tomato.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110430313389823015589/reviews
