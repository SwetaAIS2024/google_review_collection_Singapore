Khai Noordin,1,"Food is good but the Mak Cik who is running the counter and taking the orders need to changer her attitude. Running a food business is tiring but that doesn't mean you can show your attitude to your customer. Without your customers you won't be able to pay your rent.

Moral of the story, if you can't control your emotions when doing a food business then don't do it, PERIOD!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112187194393547218676/reviews
'Aidah Salleh,5,Affordable halal mala in the east. Highly recommended as it taste great and flavourful. I ordered mild spicy option which is great for mild to moderate spicy lovers like me. I think i can't go higher than mild spicy. Hope they can add more variety such as taiwanese sausage in future.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113899628275088442131/reviews
