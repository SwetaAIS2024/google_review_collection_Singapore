For example, their gyu tan steak for $30 was just a small yakiniku piece cut up into even morr thin, tiny slices. No doubt ingredients and overall taste was good but common dishes at izakaya like this should not even cost half at these portions. Some of the items such as the ebi tempura was charged at $8++ per piece. Sashimi selection for. $68++ and $88++ provided mediocre selection such as salmon and maguro.",

They have some great grilled stingray fin to go with beer, food is good but not out of this world, can tell that they are being prepared meticulously. Must try their ume sake/shochu. They have a wide variety of ume drinks, those are very good.",

Greeted by the service staff/owner and bring us to the counter as we did not make any reservation. Very congested restaurant. The other table of 8 were chatting loudly as I guess they had lots of drinks. Ordered out food as there isn‚Äôt any picture, this is quite a Japanese restaurant in Japan. Oysters are very good. The Sashimi is decent, very thin slices. Tonkatsu is a let down. Pork not fresh, probably from frozen. Likewise for the Karage. The rest are very normal. And a bottle of 720ml sake. Total damaged -  $400 plus. Value for money??\n\nFood : **\nService : ***\nValue : *****\nAtmosphere : *",
