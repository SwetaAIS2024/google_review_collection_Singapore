Koo Haoming (Haominggowhere),5,"1.	Chicken Chop with Sweet Potato Fries and Salad
The chicken chop was juicy and full of flavor—definitely the highlight of the meal. The sweet potato fries were a nice touch, crispy with a hint of sweetness. The salad was fresh and balanced the dish well.
2.	Waffle with Ice Cream
The waffle was decent, but the ice cream on top was amazing—rich, creamy, and really hit the spot. The syrup added just the right amount of sweetness.
3.	Smoked Salmon Salad
The salad looked great and had fresh ingredients, but the overall taste was pretty average. A light and healthy option, though!

What really stood out, though, was the super friendly staff. Their warm service made the experience even better!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106167453532601693476/reviews
Jesper Ng,5,"The food service was excellent, with the staff going above and beyond to help us celebrate a birthday for one of my friend. We bought a small slice of cake from them and they provided us a candle.

The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, ideal for a small celebration as there wasn’t much crowd when we went over. However, I felt that the salmon was overly salty and didn’t pair well with the pasta, affecting the overall flavor. With better seasoning and a better balance of flavors, the meal could be greatly improved. The other food though was great! :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104504525133011523705/reviews
Samson Ng,4,"“Enchanted Café has a nice ambiance with its fairy tale-themed decor, making it a cozy spot to hang out. The food, however, was pretty average. Overall, it’s a decent place if you’re looking for a chill setting, but not somewhere I’d go just for the food.”",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111896812755264351912/reviews
Thilina Dinith,1,"for me, this is an overrated place and felt mostly coming here as this is an instagramable place. food wise we tried waffles with ice cream and crème brûlée drink. do be honest the crème brûlée drink is not anything else just plain milk and just burnt the milk form in the top. simply it is taste like fresh milk nothing else. waffle is also not that exceptional with the price point. i think those waffle makers in malls make better waffles than here. ice cream was good and flavour is rich and tasty. ice cream here is must try.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101173822600514117729/reviews
ashley,5,"great place for a chill get together, with decent food and amazing waffle ice cream!

the truffle mushroom pasta had a bit too much truffle flavour for me; but the other bolognese pastas were good and the burger was great! (the fries were very crisp too)
ordered earl grey ice cream with a waffle which was super tasty.

staff was friendly and even gave us vouchers for our next visit and for their affiliated cafes.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101147010112324935595/reviews
