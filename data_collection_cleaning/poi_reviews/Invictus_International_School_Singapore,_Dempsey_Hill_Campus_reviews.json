Always warm and kind to all the kids.\n\nNice kids and a truly international environment.\nCozy small campus. It does lack some facilities as the kids grow but certainly they make the most of the resources.",

      "text": "Breaking enviroment for Kids which are not mainstream.\n\nOur kid was healthy and happy in each school before. Now we need a psychologist for trying to repair. Our child shows issues in learning, but nothing was a professinal school can¬¥t handle.\n\nThis school is not appropriate to adress kids with special needs (sensory issues, problems to focus).\n\nEven when they try, they do not have the capacity or experience to adress this kids properly.\n\nThe only they do is sending this kids home (on a almost daily base) when they don¬¥t know what to do. And give the child the feeling of being \"wrong\".\n\nEven the attitude torwards this kids is contraproductive and destroys any self esteem.\n\nAt the end even the OT¬¥s and psychologist we asked gave the advise to leave this school to save the kids mental health. Everyone was shocked how Invictus treated this kind of children.\n\nBy sure this school will fight this comment instead of bringing effort to improve their skills and reflect their knowledge.\n\nI would rather homeschool my child than sending it there. Happy to have found a great new school already.\n\nAll the other negative reviews hit the point. If you can effort them, choose another school.",
