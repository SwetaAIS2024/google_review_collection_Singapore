CK Ang,1,"Poor customer service at Nassim gate. I was hoping to change some coins for the vending machine (which does not accept card or paywave). So I went in to ask if I could change coins for $2. The elder lady did not bother to check, and turned me down immediately, with the lame excuse that they do not have enough coins.

Hopefully the owner can consider to send the staff for service training.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102381258425353321578/reviews
Xian You Lim,5,"I had a good experience here - the male staff was polite and served me my two drinks earnestly. Price is surprisingly not as expensive as I thought, and the teas were refreshing. Great to pack it as thirst quencher before walking in the hot sun.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103392631745003539210/reviews

Bren A,1,"I can see why this retail shop at Nassim gate has a lower rating than the one at the Tanglin gate.

We reached 5 mins before they closed. As soon as we entered, we were approached by an older staff with a ponytail. She was quite rude, telling us they were closing. And then a few seconds later, informing us how many minutes we have left.

When we needed help with an item, it seemed she didn't know her products but didn't want to admit it. We were contemplating buying some necklace and asked her (had to chase after her because when it looked like we were going to get it, she zoomed towards the cashier counter) what it was plated with. She said ""gold"". When we tried again to ask how many k, she just said gold again, and then added that it's just costume jewellery... like we're stupid. Even costume jewellery has a certain grade of plating. If you aren't sure, just say it. Instead of putting down the customer.

As we were leaving, another couple was coming in. They were rudely told that the shop was closed. This was exactly on the dot at 7pm.

Terrible service.. and to think Botanic Gardens is one of the places tourists tend to visit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116328377056822464274/reviews
Divanesh Sharman,2,One of the staff at the cold brew drinks area was EXTREMELY RUDE. She completely just ignored me even after calling for her attention to buy drinks for like a good 3mins! Wow such humans even exist in such a place... Luckily a much more friendlier lady attended to me shortly after.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113435369762062940793/reviews
