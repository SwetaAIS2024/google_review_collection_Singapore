I also noticed that the receptionist let ppl who came after me go in first. However, when it was my turn to consult the doctor, the consultation barely lastest for 4-5 mins. It really had me questioning, what is taking so long for the doctor as many of the patients before and after me were also consulting the doctor for 5 mins max. My experience was absolutely terrible at this clinic. If I could rate zero stars I would have but that's not possible.",

The lady at the counter asked about corporate insurance coverage but didn't even know which brands the clinic accepts.\n\nThe doctor, Dr Chew was the most unhelpful doctor I've ever seen. He didn’t even bother about my reason for visiting and rushed through the consultation, issuing medication without explanation in less than a minute. When I attempted to ask questions, he interrupted me and gave me responses like \"yeah yeah” just can’t wait for me to leave the room.",

Went to Trinity clinic and saw Dr Chew, waited very long but ended up only spent less than 2 mins inside. Told Dr my symptoms and he just anyhow auscultate my lungs (I know because I’m a healthcare professional myself) and then he proceeded to ask me if I need anything for my nausea??? Never even check my tummy. Den he continued to muffled some words saying that he will give some meds. I asked if he will be giving antibiotics and he replied, “Do you want?”. I’m like who’s the doctor now?? Anw he ended up giving me paracetamol, leftose and lozenges. Now I’m still in bed nursing a high fever.\n\nOnly go to this clinic if you need MC. Better to look for other doctors if you sincerely need medical attention. No empathy at all.",
