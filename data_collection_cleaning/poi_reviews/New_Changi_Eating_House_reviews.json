      "text": "Usually at the coffee shop for my CKT (Char Kway Teow)  fix at the Katong Jago stall in the evening. In the morning I'll have their Fried Carrot Cake. The CKT has sufficient \"wok hei\" and is quite good containing sliced lap cheong (chinese sausage), fish cake and blood cockles. Tastes equally good when you takeaway. Only minor complaint is the minute size of the blood cockles and insufficient pork lard cracklings (IMO). In the mornings the stall serves  Fried Carrot Cake which is quite good as well.",

There is another AL AASHIRA stall in the same coffee shop and we ordered Appam from them. Taste and texture is more like thosai; not the typical appam that is fluffy in the centre and crispy at the edge.\n18 Oct 2022: Ordered fishball noodles from AMPANG QQ…the texture of the fishball is really amazing!\n30 Aug 2022: The Black and White carrot cake from KATONG JAGO is really good…simply soft and yummy. AH YEE CONGEE…still as smooth, tasty and very satisfying comfort food.\n21 Feb 2022: Been here a couple of times…fishball noodles from AMPANG QQ is yummy and so is the laksa We would also go for the porridge from AH YEE and not forgetting the peanut pancakes and peanut sesame ball from PANCAKE KING",
