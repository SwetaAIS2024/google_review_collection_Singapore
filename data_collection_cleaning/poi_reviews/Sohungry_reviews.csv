Djoeis Shi,5,"This is a humble eatery without much fanfares. It is basic seating. It offers quite a variety of dishes. Definitely very affordable meal.

In this pork bowl, there are freshly boiled brocoli, and 2 pieces of qual eggs. It is healthier version and definitely very affordable!

The curry chicken is quite spicy. If you can not take some spicy and spices, then order other dishes!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111128052716293687431/reviews
Rio Wang,3,"Nacho Cheese fish & chips. Place is always not ready when we reach early like 12pm, today it was finally opened upon our arrival at 12 noon. Plenty of Nacho Cheese on the fish, that's to my liking. Tomato pasta is bland in taste and not tomato-ish enough. Their fries are good as usual, really fried to crispy bites. Fish batter is too thick for my liking, even fish fingers have more meat than their fish.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103067140074042430707/reviews
