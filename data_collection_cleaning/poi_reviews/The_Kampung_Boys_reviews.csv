Peter Lim,3,"I'd eaten various versions of nasi lemak in Msia but this Nasi Lemak Berempah cannot be considered as Msian style nasi lemak. The dish is not bad. The chicken is fried until very crispy and the spice flavor is there. However, the rice is not flavourful enough. The lemak (coconut-flavour) is relatively mild.

The most important part of nasi lemak is the sambal and this is where it fails to live up to its name of Msian-styled nasi lemak. While the sambal is different from the usual nasi lemak sambal that we are used to, I'd never seen such sambal being used in Msia before. With lots of big onion, it reminded me of Chinese-styled prawn  sambal that my family used to cook.

Verdict: The rice set is not bad. But, if you'd eaten nasi lemak in Malaysia before, you would know this is not one of them.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101588650628728817361/reviews

Kelvin Chan,1,"Went 2 times and ended disappointed.

There were no queue on my 1st visit and was told to wait 25 mins because they ran out of chilli and need to cook it. 2nd time same no queue and told to wait 25 mins because they need to fry the chicken.

Not going back",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103186806506488136886/reviews
