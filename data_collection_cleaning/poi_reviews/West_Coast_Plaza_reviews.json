      "text": "I really enjoy shopping at West Coast Plaza. It offers a great mix of retail, dining, and lifestyle options all under one roof. The layout is convenient and easy to navigate, with a welcoming atmosphere that makes every visit pleasant. There are plenty of food choices—from casual eateries to cozy cafés—and a nice variety of shops that cater to different needs, whether you’re looking for fashion, groceries, or restaurants.\n\nThe mall is also well-maintained and not\noverly crowded, which makes the experience more relaxing compared to larger, busier malls. It’s a great neighborhood spot that’s perfect for a quick visit or a relaxed day out with family and friends.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone in the area looking for a comfortable and enjoyable shopping destination!",
