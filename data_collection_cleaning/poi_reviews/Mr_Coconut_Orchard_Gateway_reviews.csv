Van Dinh,1,"I bought a tub of ice cream from the fridge and was given number 47, while they were still calling number 43. I saw the staff member already took my ice cream tub out of the fridge, but didn’t give it to me. I waited for a long time, worried the ice cream would melt, so I asked if I could receive it. The staff said “your number hasn’t been called yet.” I asked if they could be flexible since I only bought one ready-to-go item, but they insisted I had to wait until they finished making drinks for other customers first. The staff member (in the photo) replied, “this is the policy” (?!) when I asked again.

Very rigid and poor service. I give this place 1 star.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101157146632591738016/reviews
Sharon Luo,1,"Ordered a coconut taro shake with coconut balls. The drink is a coconut blended drink with taro paste with balls. A couple of sips in we realized our drink didn’t have any coconut balls in it. We went back to the store to inform the workers and they said they’d add coconut balls to the drink (the one we drank from). We agreed to this and left with our drink and as we were sipping it we realized there was no more taro paste in the drink. We went back again to inform the worker who advised they did scoop the taro paste into our drink. I advised it doesn’t taste like taro and that we initially had paste at the bottom of our drink. They said they can add more taro paste to our drink. They took a new cup and added paste to the bottom and poured the remainder of our drink into that new cup. It felt weird that they didn’t just make a new drink for us because by the end of this whole situation, our coconut shake had melted and the entire integrity of the drink does not taste like how it would have if we were to have gotten our drink correct in the first place. I feel like their profit margins are big enough for them to remake our drink and for customer satisfaction. I would not order from Mr. Coconut again after this experience.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115438425187483585654/reviews
Tony Chiang,2,"Received my order for coconut shake and it was just bland ice water towards the end, not a hint of coconut at all.  Had this large drink so many times and I provided feedback to crew.  Very poor response from then and cannot be bothered about my experience.  Shame to this business",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104224419167791860916/reviews
Lili,5,"Ordered their signature coconut shake with 75% sugar which is good, but i think with way less sugar the drink will still taste nice. The queue was pretty long but bearable and it’s worth the wait.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108308908381793425991/reviews
Matt Guitguiten,5,This is a very refreshing drink. It has real coconut flesh and the milk is really delicious. You can adjust the sweetness level and still enjoy its taste and aroma. This is really really good.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116020327943966345046/reviews
