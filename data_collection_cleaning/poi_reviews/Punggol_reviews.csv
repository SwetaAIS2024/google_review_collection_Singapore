Angel Koh,5,"Lost my atm debit card and went to the station to collect, they advised me that deal to security reason, the item has been sealed and will be sent off to their main office.

I felt it was a good and effective gesture that little things like this matters. I felt safe that they actually had procedures put in place to help make lost and found item claimable to the rightful owners. Thank you persons on duty today!

Luke Phang,5,Spacious bus interchange that you can reach easily from the MRT. Connects you to the rest of Punggol area. Take bus 84 to go to Coney Island. Make sure you take Exit B from the MRT to reach this place.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117681118694147432030/reviews
