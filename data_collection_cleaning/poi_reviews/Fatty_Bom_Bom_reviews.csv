E Lee,2,"Disappointing meal. Decided to give it a go and try this despite the reviews, not my usual western shop (nearby @ block 477) and I kinda regret instantly. Chicken portion is so small (almost same size as the bun), fries were nicely fried though. And the brown sauce taste burnt. Next time I’ll just stick to my usual western spot, and it’s cheaper there too, with bigger portion, and won’t be coming back here anymore.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104674557512757422746/reviews
Victoria Anne U,5,"First time trying Fatty Bom Bom! Ordered from Food Panda.

I ordered the crunchy chicken (which comes with Cajun Fries and Mash potatoes as sides) and a generous serving of Mayonnaise.
And a serving of Jerry’s Popcorn Chicken.

Both dishes were absolutely delicious. For a hawker stall, it definitely exceeds expectations. Chicken was moist, crunch and very tasty. And it is pretty affordable.

I’m usually not a fan of hawker’s Western Food - majority are bland and boring, but fatty Bom bom really surprised me.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108628634138640337908/reviews
Ain x,1,"Ordered a grilled fish pasta and cajun chicken with rice, but they served the cajun chicken with pasta instead.
When we informed the staff, she was skeptical, and thought we made a mistake when ordering when the cashier made the mistake keying in. She also insisted we would have to pay extra for rice, even though the menu clearly states that pasta or rice is $8.90. Additionally, the grilled fish turned out to be fried and crunchy, not grilled at all, and both pasta dishes were bland and tasteless.

Haven’t had fatty bom bom in a while and i’m quite disappointed with the quality of the food now.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104421531972725686140/reviews
Yingying,5,"Tried fatty bom bom via food delivery app! Price is decent, portion is quite big! We had chicken chop, mashed potatoes, fries and bun. Food arrived hot and pretty fast, around 15-20 minutes. Would recommend to customers staying in Tampines. Overall good experience with the app and the resturant.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117289079780130956871/reviews
