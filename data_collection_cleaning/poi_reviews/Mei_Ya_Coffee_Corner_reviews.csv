Darroch Chua,5,"Even better than Yakun! (And more affordable) Quite possibly the best soft boiled eggs, while the consistency of the kopi is really good. Toast  can be changed to peanut as well. A rare gem of a find!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106979406001099514519/reviews
Simple,4,"Those beautifully sous vide eggs. The eggs are cracked open and seasoned by stall owners as they prepare the set for you.

Ordered all day value set ($3.30) with kaya toast (standard fare) and Teh c (good medium strength and milkiness). All components made it a good solid breakfast set.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108559166996678728312/reviews
Debbie Tan,5,"We were pleasantly surprised how smooth the eggs were and it was because they use a sous vide machine for consistency! *chefs kiss*

Toasts were thinly sliced. Ratio of bread to kaya and butter was great! Coffee was good too! My non-coffee drinker husband downed the whole cup. Great place!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102367822278253084737/reviews
Cl Ang,4,Eggs are good. White shell type. Soy sauce only add at the stall. Coffee not bad too.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113021594581484035202/reviews
Zheng Kai,5,"The gem of breakfast sets found in Meiling-Stirling area.

Swollen half-boiled eggs — precisely heated with the membrane holding the yolk intact when cracked.

Crispy Kaya Toast — 4 pieces of toasted white bread sliced into halves, slapped with gooey kaya and chunky butter slices.

Slippery Kopi C — smooth, creamy on each sip, with slight bittersweet notes on the aftertaste.

Tried recommending this stall to my mom and aunts, but was surprised they patronised this stall from their youth. Talk about multi-generational approval!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116500114374322213772/reviews
