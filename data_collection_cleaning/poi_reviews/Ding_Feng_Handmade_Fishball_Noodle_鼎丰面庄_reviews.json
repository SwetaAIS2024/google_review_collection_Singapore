The Xiaomei who serves during midnight supper makes the best noodles in Singapore, her sauce is always accurate, not too salty not too blend, perfect.\nShe's always friendly, and that's e reason why everyone enjoy her noodles in this stall too. 10 üåüüòã\n\nBut there's a difference if it's day time order it cannot beat the 12am supper noodle. That's why I only visit after 11pm Best üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",

Bowl comes with a good amount of ingredients. Fishballs are good thus I added, 2pcs $1.30, slightly expensive for fishballs though.\n\nStall is open 24hrs so no worries even if you are hungry late at night in this area.\n\nOverall I still enjoyed the noodles but don't have to specially travel for this.",
