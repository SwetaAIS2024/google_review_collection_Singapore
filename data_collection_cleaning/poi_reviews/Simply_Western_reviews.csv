Veena Toh,5,"Good and affordable western food with generous portions. The fish and chips, coleslaw and mashed potato were our favourites! You could taste that they use better quality ingredients here compared to other western food at a coffee shop. Must try when you are here.
They even have kids meal for $4.5.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116860156990866575142/reviews

I was hesitant to write a review as I had come here today specifically to have grilled pork chops with spaghetti.

To my dismay, the Western stall next to the tze char is gone! But a new one sprang up beside the drinks stall.

As I tucked into my grilled dory with rice set meal, I realised the food is more than passable -- hence the photo showing food already eaten üòÜ

The fish fillet was nicely done: lightly browned on both sides yet soft and moist. What wasn't right is the brown sauce drizzled over it -- this was way too salty!!!

The coleslaw was absolutely crunchy and creamy. I realised it was homemade as I saw the chef shredding cabbage when there was no order pending. Definitely need to ask for an upsize of this salad üòã

Yellow rice came in a huge portion such that I couldn't finish it all. It's not cooked Indian style with spices or raisins, but surprisingly good enough to eat üëç

So, this grilled dory set turned out quite satisfying. At $8.50, it's a tad expensive though.

I spied deep fried dory on the menu, so I suppose we could get fish and chips here too üòú

Before I left, I asked about the weight of their ribeye steak -- it's 180g. That's something I'm likely to come back for, so till next time...

P.S. It seems harder and harder to find Western hawker stalls in Punggol which serve pork chops! üò¢

#MHTamChiak reckons he'd have to dig deeper into his pockets at places like Astons (at Punggol Coast) or perhaps Buddy Hoagies (in WWP) just to savour delectable bone-in pork chops.

So far, both places haven't been tested but it could be soon...",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102479625642210396540/reviews
