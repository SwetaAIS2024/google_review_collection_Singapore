      "text": "So happy to stay at a 5-star hotel in Singapore!\nWalking into the hotel felt like stepping into an art galleryâ€”so many artsy pieces displayed in the lobby, it was such a vibe.\n\nHi to Kishern, the friendly receptions!\n\nRoom\nThe room was spacious, cozy, and aesthetically pleasing. It had complete amenities, and the complimentary coffee and tea were refilled daily. They even provided TWG tea as a complimentary treat! The bathrobe was also unique and stylish.\n\nFacilities\nLoved the rooftop swimming poolâ€”amazing views of the Singapore Flyer and Esplanade. Itâ€™s the perfect spot for photos and chilling in the evening. Big thanks to Thatcha from the Naumi Bar staff who kindly helped take some great photos!\n\nLocation\nPerfect! Super close to Chijmes, Bras Basah Complex, Bugis, and Orchard.",

      "text": "Overall my experience was very good for 8 nights business trip, very practical hotel and well located near one of the biggest convention centers in Singapore, also, it is surrounded by several dining options as the hotel doesnâ€™t have any dining options other than the basic breakfast in the morning, so you need to set your expectations carefully before booking and based on the purpose of your trip. My room was excellent as I believe it was upgraded. Hotel is clean and smells well. A very tiny gym that was a bit of disappointment but at least you have the chance to exercise. Staff is very helpful and responsive.",

Some of the reviews for this hotel seem very misaligned with our experience.\n\nRooms clean and very comfortable the pool/bar area has an excellent view across Raffels/CBD and as a first time visitor the locations could not have been better to explore.\n\nWe traveled from London for 4 nights and felt the quality exceeded expectations for the price (we did opt for a larger room) I wonder if people are comparing the price to other south East Asian cities - which is fruitless.\n\nEveryone who severed us was so kind a smiley estate happy hour and at the front desk.\n\nHope to return ðŸ™‚",
