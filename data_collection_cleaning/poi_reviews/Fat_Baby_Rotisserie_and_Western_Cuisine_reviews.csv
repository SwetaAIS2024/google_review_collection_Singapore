KKT,3,"$8.90 for 3 pcs fried chicken and some fries, same price for meat ball spaghetti. Fried chicken is very crispy, but a bit over fried, meat quite dry. Spaghetti quite diluted and soupy. Quantity quite filling though.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
Lau SY,1,"$8+ for this Sausage carbonara which turned out to be hotdogs in spaghetti with carbonara sauce which had a consistency closer to a soup üòÇ

Waited for close to 30mins for this mediocre meal. Even my 9yo gave up midway through the dish. Definitely not returning.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100569092492781343557/reviews

Roy Chiang,1,"fish looks good but it‚Äôs over fried and hard. Fork on my left hand, knife on my right, I pushed the knife down into the fish and the fish rotated and the fork flew like a catapult. Mayonnaise also has a layer of ‚Äúwax‚Äù on top not sure if because it was left outside for too long (you can zoom in and see for yourself). Fries was tasteless

Price wise, not worth. $8.90 you decide

Should‚Äôve went to Mac‚Äôs to eat, more worth got drink also",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114931956985478572818/reviews
M Ang,3,"Next to the Fat Baby Ban Mian store in Cantine. Serves halal western food of decent quality.
Tried chicken chop with tomato pasta, the pasta was quite soft and overcooked, sauce quite watery, chicken is quite small but overall it tastes ok. It's not expensive so not expecting too much. Chicken chop with fries, mashed potato and raisin bun was slightly better.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103937264274214717353/reviews
