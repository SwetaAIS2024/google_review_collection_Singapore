This mee siam comes with gu cai. Can ask for extra or none depending  on personal  preferences. There's a side scoup  of Chilli paste at the side.\n\nAlso serves some nice varieties of nonya kuey some days.\n\nThe day stall is the one with the bao steamer next to it and served by an mature uncle or a Chinese lady.\n\nTowards  evening, the mee siam is sold besides the wonton mee stall and just in front of the Chinese rojak stall.",
