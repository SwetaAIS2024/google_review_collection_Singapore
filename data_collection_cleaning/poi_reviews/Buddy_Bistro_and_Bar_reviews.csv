gemeaux,5,"We were initially waiting for a table at Refuel Cafe but decided to switch to this cafe instead as it was relatively empty. Ended up having brunch here from a little after 11am to just past 1pm. The atmosphere was calm, with only a few groups of customers around, which made for a pleasant dining experience.

The service stood out‚Äîattentive and thoughtful. Concerned that we might feel hot sitting outdoors, the staff checked in with us twice to ask if we wanted the fan turned on. Fortunately, the outdoor seating area was cozy and comfortable, shaded by trees and cooled occasionally by a gentle breeze, so the fan wasn‚Äôt necessary even at midday.

I was pleasantly surprised by the food. The fish burger came with a fried egg inside, which added a comforting and delicious touch. The fries were perfectly crispy‚Äîneither oily nor overly salted, just how I like them. My friend had the chicken chop, which was tender and tasty. The mushroom soup was rich and creamy, generously filled with mushrooms. We also enjoyed the coffee and dessert, both of which were well done.

Given the quality of the food, service, and ambiance, I was genuinely surprised the cafe wasn‚Äôt more crowded.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100443395079806825726/reviews
m w,5,"This is my 2nd time at Buddy Bistro & Bar, and while I still enjoyed the experience, there were some differences from my first visit.

üçï Tom Yum Seafood Pizza ‚Äì Highly Recommended!
This is the star of the menu! üåü The combination of tangy Tom Yum sauce, juicy prawns, and melted cheese is just perfect. The flavors are well-balanced, slightly spicy, and super addictive. If you love Thai flavors, you MUST try this!

ü•© Grilled Pork Chop ‚Äì Not as good as before
The first time I had it, it was juicy and flavorful, but this time, it was a bit dry and less tender. Still decent, but not as impressive as my first visit. Hope they can maintain consistency!

üçù Creamy Mushroom Pasta ‚Äì Still a solid choice
The creamy sauce was rich and delicious, and the mushrooms added a nice umami flavor. The sesame topping is a unique touch that I like.

‚ú® Overall Experience:
‚úîÔ∏è Tom Yum Pizza is a must-try!
‚úîÔ∏è Nice cozy atmosphere, great for chilling with friends.
‚úîÔ∏è Service is friendly, but food consistency could be improved.

CT liaw,3,"Owner/staff friendly and helpful.

As for good wise, buffalo wing is recommended that come with  incredibly savory, with a deep, rich flavor that comes from the perfectly seasoned sauce. They're satisfying and delicious.

The rest of the good is average,",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115843697549679461073/reviews
Fel Ong,4,Nice to find a decent bristo in the neighborhood. Good for casual drinks and grabbing light bites. The roasted pork with crispy skin goes very well with the tart Thai green chili dip as it cuts through the grease. Nice layers of meat n fat ratio but a little on the dry side as I'm guessing it's cooked twice to get it served crisp and hot. Very generous helping of fluffy crisp fries drizzled with cheese and mayo. Pet friendly seats outside.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100958925358251731321/reviews
