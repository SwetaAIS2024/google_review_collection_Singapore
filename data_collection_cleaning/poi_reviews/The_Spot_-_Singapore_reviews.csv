Kay H.,5,"Always enjoy my visits to The Spot be it for drinks only or for food. Good vibes, nice ambience. Food and service are great. Staff are friendly and service efficient. Special shout out to Winnie, who was very attentive and takes initiative to make our dining experience more pleasant. Hiring the right people is indeed more important than training them. I believe that's what makes The Spot such a popular and successful spot!
