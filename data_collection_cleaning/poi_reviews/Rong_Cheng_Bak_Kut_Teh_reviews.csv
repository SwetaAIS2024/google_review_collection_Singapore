jayden,4,"Dont know why there's so many bad reviews here, its actually quite nice. Quick warm bowl of pork liver soup set before catching the plane. You can also add extra soup if you want. Quite reasonable price compare to the rest of the food in airport where mostly its close to or above $10 for a simple meal like this.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews

Ahlo Chung,1,"Totally Ridiculous No Respect Unprofessional Restaurant
I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the service my parents experienced at the Sin Ming Road Rong Cheng Bak Kut Teh restaurant in Singapore Airport.

My parents were traveling with Singapore Airlines from Guangzhou to Australia transfer in Singapore. While waiting at the airport, they decided to have dinner at your restaurant. As they were unfamiliar with the electronic ordering system, they sought assistance from one of your staff members to place their order. After successfully ordering, they received a pickup number. My father briefly left for the restroom, and upon his return, he found that their number was called for pickup. However, when he presented the pickup number at the counter, he was informed that the food had already been collected. My parents had not received their food.

Instead of investigating the issue, your staff immediately questioned my parents, implying that they were attempting to deceive the restaurant. This accusatory and disrespectful treatment significantly impacted my parentsâ€™ mood. Subsequently, your staff found the customer who had taken the food, and it was discovered that this customer had the same pickup number as my parents.

Despite this clear error, the restaurant manager did not apologize. Instead, he dismissively stated that such a problem was unprecedented and laughed it off. This lack of professionalism and empathy is unacceptable.

My parents have never experienced such poor service in Australia, and this incident has had a lasting negative effect on their emotional well-being and might cause mental health issues. They have been distressed for several days following their arrival in Australia.

I urge you to provide thorough training to your staff to ensure they handle such situations professionally and respectfully. Singapore is often the first point of contact for international travelers, and the service provided should reflect the high standards expected.

Please reflect on how to properly address customer issues and adopt a more considerate approach towards visitors.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115761809626386135055/reviews
