Rennie Lee,4,"Tried a basic Bacon Aglio which was really good. Flavorful~ Definitely wanna come back and try their homemade soup and other unique pastas. Only thing is not many seats in this area, might be good to consider takeaway back to your office as a backup plan.

Came back to try the soup set! Aglio wasn’t as fragrant as the first time. Soup was definitely freshly made tho, nice! Not instant type at all as it has corn bits. Tea was good too!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104896149882118051128/reviews
Tiffany Koh,4,"Don't let the small space turn you away. You must try the aglio olio prawn pasta, stunning! Big fresh juicy prawns with pasta soaked in the rich prawn sauce.

I also tried the creamy version, but the cheese was too overpowering for me, and it also covered up the prawn taste, I don't recommend that.

Just go for the aglio olio. You won't regret trying.

Update:

Visited recently and saw that the prawn sizes shrunk quite a bit and they didn't give me the entire prawns with the head attached to them.

Also, discovered that I need to pay $1 per level of spiciness. Speechless and hence I'm dropping 1star.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103364360492811481209/reviews
Isni Iskandar,5,"I’d say this place is my MOST-est Favorite place. They’ve the best Spaghetti Prawn in town! With the bearable spiciness level, mine always level 3 just perfect. They can do customized menu, but believe me their menu super good where you cant find in any other restaurant. Chef cooks with passion, Karen always come with the best suggestions for the menu options. Whenever I go there feels like you dine in at your friend’s kitchen😂😂 ( of course when dine in allow meh) so photos are some menus, fish pie, beef ribs, check their IG @toftloftsg for more pics.
I’ve ordered before! Place is so strategic, coz I love Tj. Pagar 😉
Super highly recommended 👍🏼 👍🏼 👍🏼",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102736562546357245228/reviews
Casilda K,5,"One of my favourite places to go! They are so creative with their type of food (hence also allows customization which most places do not have the flexibility to), the food is also yummy! Had the Pork collar steak and Yam gnocchi which were their specials and both were really good! The pork collar took a long time to cook (Heard they came in 4 hours before to start cooking it!) and it tasted so flavourful and juicy! They also make pies (Mac & Cheese, Pork and mushroom, Apple Pie and many more!)

Putting so much effort and love in the food they create! Thank you! ☺️☺️",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114106443180486364413/reviews
Zen Toh,5,"A treasure find by my colleagues. Have been visiting several times during lunch hour for their prawn aglio olio, very consistent standard. So good that  I brought my partner to have a taste of it today ^^

Highly recommend.
Ps. Didn't take a photo of the pasta before it was gone...",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116364108286031992461/reviews
