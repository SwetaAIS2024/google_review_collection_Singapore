Fion Koh,3,"One of the larger spaces to have food other than food junction and Saizeriya. However, the recent toast that they tried to imitate SuuKee Coffee didn’t made it. The orh nee portion was super pathetic. Super not worth.

For cheese fries, mayo was more than cheese too.. but I would say their serving speed was quite ok. Also when my child spilled milo, they didn’t give me black face and clean it up speedily.

If I come again for other food, will redo the stars to be fair for them. Take it as a pinch of salt because I’m only having limited dish this round.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112840814508007306480/reviews
Avril Atkeg,4,"Great cafe on Level 1 of this mall to enjoy a quick meal without long queues. Service is efficient and seats are plentiful for small groups.

Better dishes are the laksa, black pepper chicken and curry chicken. Toast set is fairly good, if you just want to fill your belly. Gravy is thick enough for the reasonable price. The macaroni chicken, pumpkin noodle soup and horfun were underwhelming and plain (but ok for young children).",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113878502697192504018/reviews
Angel Lim,1,"Very bad experience at the Coffee Hive Rivervale Branch . Felt scammed , Was charged full amount despite there is balance amount in my coffee hive app . Was asked to top up to my app in order to use my app balance . But yet after I pay wave for the intended top up of $20 to my loyalty app  ,  i found that they charged me $20.40 instead with no 10% cashback credited per the loyalty program claims! They also did not deduct the existing balance from my app and just charge full price on my meal. Then What’s the point for having the loyalty program ?? and when  I said I want to top up and use my existing balance???!!! One Chinese and One foreign female counter staff insist rudely that nothing can be done . Very dishonest , irresponsible and rude behaviours !! Totally felt that their loyalty program and staff are a total scam  !",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112912580261055827947/reviews
Lawkoh,3,"Like the outside seats
Spacious and comfortable.

Ordered the common basic set.
It's far away from our expectation.
The coffee and tea don't taste as good compare to other.
Bread kaya and butter not generous too.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108052690301826511555/reviews
