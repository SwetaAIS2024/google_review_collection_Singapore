LEE,5,"The food portions are generous, and the charcoal mookata adds a unique, delicious flavor. The staff is friendly and attentive, enhancing the dining experience. Unfortunately, pets are not allowed, which is a slight drawback for pet owners. Overall, it’s a great spot for a hearty meal!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100197091380215637681/reviews
Wei Ting Tay,5,"Really good food and I love that it's charcoal cooked. I'm very picky about mookatas and this is very close to the taste of the popular brand I really love. Would come again. Excellent chilli sauces and soup! Great value and quality for price and portion. If you're small eaters, the 1-2 pax can feed 3 pax.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113756779672051666409/reviews
Ivan Liew,5,"Our regular Mookata place! We love the soup, green and red chili sauces, and the fact that is charcoal. Our usual order is marinated chicken, sliced beef, and som tum. Prices are reasonable with no service charge or GST. Being in East Coast “coffee shop” area it is breezy and has good casual ambience.

Service is excellent, friendly and efficient. We left a bag behind accidentally. The next time we came the owners remembered my family and gave it back to us!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112432243536170370352/reviews
Tan Jun Yang,5,Environment is much more conducive compared to other mookata places. Plenty of fans available. Reasonably priced and value for money. Marinated meat was well seasoned. Baby chair available too.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116652199618216577912/reviews
Max Tan,3,"I recently tried this Thai mookata place, and while it was overall okay, it wasn’t the best tasting mookata I’ve had. The portion sizes are generous, and I appreciated the neat and tidy presentation of everything. It’s clear they take care in the way they serve the food.

One big plus is the atmosphere—being located in East Coast Park, you can enjoy some nice sea breeze while dining, and there’s a convenient restroom nearby.

However, a few things didn’t quite hit the mark for me. The sauce wasn’t to my liking, and the meat needs to be marinated longer to allow the flavors to infuse properly—it tasted a bit plain. The pork wasn’t as tender as I’d hoped, and there was only one soup option, which had a strong peppery taste that might not suit everyone.

All in all, it’s a decent option if you’re looking for a filling meal in a relaxing outdoor setting, but I wouldn’t say it’s the top choice for mookata.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112309095195912631544/reviews
