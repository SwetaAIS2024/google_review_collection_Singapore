Siang Woen Wong,5,"Had the special Mee Hoon Kueh, dry noodle, dumplings and bitter gourd double fish soup. I'll start from Mee Hoon Kueh. First of all, the portion is really generous! I'm a big eater and I find it's enough for me. It's the most special Mee Hoon Kueh as the shape and is similar to Ravioli but with a better texture. It absorbs the gravy evenly and hence it taste better. Mee Hoon Kueh and noodles are hand made daily by owner too. Fried fish coated with a very thin batter too with good amount of fish. Fish soup makes me think of home cooked soup without the usual MSG. Highly recommended if you're near that area.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110202407210142674326/reviews
