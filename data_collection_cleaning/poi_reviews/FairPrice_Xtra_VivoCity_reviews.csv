Benedict Correya,5,"A spacious and well-organized supermarket that offers a wide variety of groceries, household items, and fresh produce. The store is clean and well-lit, making it easy to navigate through different sections. The range of products is impressive, including international brands and local goods, with competitive prices that cater to a variety of budgets.

The fresh produce section is particularly noteworthy, with an extensive selection of fruits, vegetables, and meats. The store also offers ready-to-eat meals and a good assortment of organic products. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the self-checkout counters make the shopping process faster and more convenient.

The store is conveniently located at VivoCity, so it’s ideal for combining grocery shopping with other activities in the mall.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292377967743781974/reviews
Xoom Too,5,"Very useful FairPrice as it’s located in the very busy VivoCity mall and is pretty big with 2 floors. There’s your typical snacks, beverages, hygiene products, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish sections and way more smaller or bigger sections. Aisles are very organized, the whole FairPrice is quite clean, quite a few staff all around and very friendly as well. I’ve come here multiple times and always had a good experience.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105863133358477079886/reviews

yun wei Choo,4,"Stunning two-story supermarket
A local large supermarket, FairPrice guarantees the best prices, and the whole style is completely different from the FairPrice opened in the neighborhood. There is even a bakery (swee heng 1989), a coffee shop, and a specially planned seat in the deli area so that consumers can buy and eat immediately. There are all kinds of fresh fruits and vegetables, and the store is bright and spacious, without a sense of oppression.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118147935920487907981/reviews
