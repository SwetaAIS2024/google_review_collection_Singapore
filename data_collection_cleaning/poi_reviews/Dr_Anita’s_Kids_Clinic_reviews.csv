Cc Chen,5,"Dr. Anita is a wonderful pediatrician.

We first met her when my daughter was just a newborn 8 years ago and struggling with a skin condition. As a new mom, I felt completely lost and helpless, but Dr. Anita immediately identified the problem and knew exactly what to do. My daughter recovered very quickly after seeing her and I’ll never forget the relief I felt.

Since then, she’s been the doctor I turn to whenever I have doubts or worries. Even after moving far from her clinic, I still go back to her for a second opinion. She gives me a sense of reassurance and trust that I haven’t been able to find with other doctors. I truly feel my daughter is in the best hands with her. Thank you Doctor!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102818582179288956454/reviews
Nishtha Narula,5,"Dr Anita Menon is amazing, I trust her with my child’s health. I have been going to her since my kid was a newborn. She has a very practical, methodical and comforting approach for managing any illness, vaccination or other conditions. Her clinic is always busy and her pricing is on the higher side. However, the reception staff has always accommodated me if I had any urgent requests and wanted to see the doctor urgently. Overall, I am thankful we have a doctor of her calibre in the East Coast.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101020088560592081015/reviews
Fion Huang`,1,"She is hardly around and definitely hard to see her. Children illlnees can’t wait for next day appointment. Even though her clinic is really the nearest for me, but I hardly can make any appointment to see her in 7 years after 3 kids … I only managed to see her 7 years ago for my first born and only once.

So I wouldn’t recommend waiting around this clinic unless your child can really wait! (Which is hardly possible Le)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105369383136920790652/reviews
Hui Ni W,2,"Dr Anita and staff are good. But only come for your child's vaccination. It is so difficult to make appointment if your child is unwell, it's always full and not accept walk in or the clinic only see well children for vaccination on that day. Due to this reason we have to seek for another PD.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113572304545355570561/reviews
W S,5,Dr Anita and her staff have been really good with our daughter and she (and us) have felt very much at ease when we visit. She is knowledgeable and walks us through the diagnosis which really helps to help us understand what our daughter is going through. And the staff have always been nice and accommodating.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112889235802520321724/reviews
