Veronica,5,"Had a really great time at Kamal‚Äôs workshop with a lovely souvenir to bring home. Kamal was really knowledgeable, patient and evidently passionate about batik. Would recommend for team bonding activities or if you would like to try your hand at creating a striking decorative piece. The class is easy to follow and isn‚Äôt too daunting for beginners too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103249984243210142502/reviews
Josephine Tan,5,"Friendly local batik studio & community art gallery located on the rooftop (Level 4, accessible via the glass lift next to the info counter) of Wisma Geylang Serai. It offers a variety of batik workshops for both small & large groups. They also have interesting pre-waxed batik painting kits that make great gifts tooüéÅ, but do call to check the availability of various patterns.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112348698048907176645/reviews
Sarah Diab,5,I did both the Basic and Intermediate Batik workshops and really enjoyed them! Both workshops are thorough with a wealth of information and new skills learnt. I like how the materials and we'll designed for a beginner and have options to buy take home packs too.  I would definitely be back to practice the skill. Glad to have found this new hobby! Thank you Mr Kamal for having your studio and sharing your love of Batik with us. Highly recommend for everyone!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105949139992204421691/reviews
Jean Lee,5,My K2 children attended the batik workshop and they throughly enjoyed themselves. Mr Kamal also guided the children along during the painting process and the pace of the workshop was just nice.

Peng Peng Ee,5,"My mother and I had an amazing time learning about Batik Painting and attempted to do a piece ourselves. Kamal, the Artist, was very engaging and imparted very useful tips in batik painting. You do not have to bring anything! Materials are provided and if you need any inspiration, Kamal has plenty samples for you to choose.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113708520281643163701/reviews
