BX Ho,3,"Food is generally good BUT the pigeon management is really disappointing. Even though attempts to scare away pigeons through dummy paper crows were introduced, the pigeons are way smarter then what the management thinks they are. To be more concise, they're useless in addressing the issue. Pigeons are seen aggressively flying across tables and leftover cutlery, poking through the legs of customers and even giving tables and customers their heavenly droppings from the overhanging pipes. (See Pic) Perhaps if the management is able to adopt more effective ""anti- pigeon"" measures by enclosing all open areas with safety nets (like the those implemented at Bishan Bus Interchange Hawker Centre), dining at Chinatown Food Complex will be a much more hygienic and pleasant experience.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114734782162485573534/reviews
JG Lee,3,"Food are becoming too expensive and the standard has dropped a lot compared to the past.
The worst store is 02-172 (literally translate to ""sister Zhen food store"") ... bought ""Vinegar Pig Trotter"" there, $7 for a small bowl with only 1 piece of tough/hard meat, 2 other pieces of small bones with a bit of skin and an egg! OMG the worst and most ridiculous pig trotters I every had! Visit at your own risk!
The Chendol store run by an old lady is nice though, $2 per bowl serve on a retro bowl.
Then again, as mentioned ... becoming too touristy and expensive price with generally lower food standard already.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108861501993658096427/reviews
Cameron Marsicek,4,"One of the last""authentic"" hawker market experiences in Singapore.  More of a day time excursion as most of the stalls closer by the evening.  Be sure to try Singapore's national dish - chicken rice!",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108210622818581103265/reviews
Herman Chia,1,Too many obstruction and countless public tables being illegal occupied by the hawker. They place their goods and others on the public tables causing customers are unable to use them.
