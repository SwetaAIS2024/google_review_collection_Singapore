Mayisha Alamgir,5,"The restaurant was amazing! From the delicious food to the warm atmosphere, it was a truly delightful experience. The chilli crab was a standout, and the hot and sour soup was equally scrumptious.  What really impressed me was seeing the owner personally collecting the dishes from the tables. It was a lovely touch and added to the overall warmth of the place.  The complimentary dessert was a delightful surprise, and it perfectly capped off the meal.  I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be returning on my next visit to Singapore.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100513025360008872129/reviews
Silver Lee,2,"Overall, the dishes that came were neither fantastic nor horrible. All of them are on the average side.

Disappointing was the black pepper crab. Was just boiled and then fried quickly with the black pepper sauce. Sauce did not penetrate in the crab. So when the sauce slides out, seems like it’s tasteless and just eating boiled crabs. Not worth the trip there",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103399009560973617124/reviews
McYLLe,5,"We had our company Chinese New Year dinner at Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant, and it was a fantastic experience. The 10-course menu was thoughtfully curated, and every dish was well-prepared. Our bosses generously hosted the dinner, so I can’t comment on the price, but the overall dining experience was excellent.

The evening started with the traditional Lo Hei, setting a festive tone. Then came the standout dishes—Lobster with Italian Sauce was absolutely superb, and the Chili Crab was rich and flavorful. One of the highlights for me was the Kurubuta Pork with Romaine Lettuce and Dip—so delicious that I’d definitely come back just for that!

The service was also commendable. One of the staff members went out of her way to offer various vegetarian options for a colleague, which was greatly appreciated.

With great food, excellent service, and a lively atmosphere, everyone enjoyed both the meal and the camaraderie. Overall, a memorable experience, and I’d highly recommend this place for group gatherings and special occasions. Looking forward to dining here again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117553835180250865360/reviews
Daren Wong,5,"The few dishes we ordered were really good. The last time I came here was around 40 years ago when I was just a kid, but I always remembered I enjoyed the food here. Didn't disappoint after so many years. Parking is a challenge; had dinner on a Sun, it was really packed. I think they are understaffed for weekend.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105528125542944356613/reviews
Sammy Soong,5,"This is one of the oldest restaurant in town. The quality of food add a ton of childhood memories. The chicken is out of this world, still holding the taste profile. Especially if you are the 70s.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101973858090677551447/reviews
