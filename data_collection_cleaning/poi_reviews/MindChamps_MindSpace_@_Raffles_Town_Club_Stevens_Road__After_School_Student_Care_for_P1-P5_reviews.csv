Wanzhen Lim,5,"Mindspace at RTC has provided a very conducive environment for my child to learn and play after school hours. They even help by fetching my child from school after enrichment classes and keeping them engaged with many different activities during holidays and HBL (home-based learning) days. The teachers and staff at RTC are incredibly friendly, accommodating, and always approachable. I truly appreciate their dedication and care for the children.
