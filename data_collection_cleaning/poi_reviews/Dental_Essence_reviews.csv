kityin ku,5,"Dr. Spencer at Dental Essence is amazing! He’s incredibly friendly and took the time to clearly explain what was happening with my teeth. He walked me through every step of the process, which really helped me feel at ease. He was so gentle and caring, always checking in to make sure I was comfortable. The whole procedure was completely painless — honestly, the best dental experience I’ve ever had. The nurses were super friendly too, which made the whole visit even more pleasant. I’ll definitely be recommending Dr. Spencer and the team to all my friends!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105167699075374332172/reviews

Donna Ong Mei Ching - PT,5,"I’ve been going to Dental Essence for over a decade and each time, have received a fantastic dental experience from the caring and efficient staff at the counter to the dentist himself. Both myself and my son are being treated by Dr. Andrew Lui and I have only the highest praise for his client service, experience and skill. He was able to fill up multiple cavities for my fidgety 4 year old (then) and made each experience as gentle and as painless as possible.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105058890439028678654/reviews
Jessie Oh,5,"I have been a loyal patron/patient of Dr Pearson of Dental Essence since 2013. He’s very personable, professional and cares for his patients, always addressing my dental needs. My daughter has also been visiting with Dr Pearson since she was a teenager 10 years ago. I brought my elderly father to this dental clinic and was attended by Dr Andrew Lui who took care of his denture problem.  Rest assured that you will be well attended to.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101359016130706462294/reviews
