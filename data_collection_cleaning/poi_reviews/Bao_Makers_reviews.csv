Christian N,5,"Bao is nice as, discover this new branch of Bao Makers near Botanic Gardens.

I ordered Ice White Coffee ($6) and Salted Egg Chicken Bao ($4.5).  The Iced White Coffee is surprisingly nice for a Bao shop level.

The chicken meat was tender with delicious salted egg chicken sauce!

Definitely will come back again ;)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117213244989099366988/reviews
Cheryl Lim,5,"Baos are delicious as usual.

Tried the new sweet cream coffee - I liked that it's not too sweet. In fact, if you want some caffeine kick, have a sip before stirring it. Shiok!

As it is an air-conditioned environment, the food smell lingered & I smelled like food leaving the premise. üòÇ",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104166132267821058996/reviews
Glen Francis,5,"Small place but excellent ‚ÄúBao‚Äù. Nice creations and the taste is good. Coffee is not too bad. But the Baos are nice and I think well priced.
Tried the salted chicken and beef. Like the beef.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106709479245323997426/reviews

suzen,5,"A newly surprising discovery that tot was losing them since they had closed the last outlet at Keong Siak Street.

Other than this outlet being spot at, the staff informed that they have another outlet at Far East Square. Misses their chilli crab bun so much especially with fried one.

Been supporting since Covid time. One was takeaway at Westgate. And another one was dinner with a group at Keong Siak. Will go back again & see whether can try other flavours. Thks to the staff for offering the plate. Cos usually I don't like to use my bare hands to hold the food & eat üòã",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110813622133166743966/reviews
