It’s halal and self service from front there’s few kiosk or order your food and get a pager to collect your food at the counter opposite the restaurant. Had the signature boat noodle and overall is not bad. Soup is flavourful and ingredients is generous. Great spot for a casual meal.",

My goodness...hard fried balls of meat, cold fried egg, chilled watery noodle salad that soaked the warm rice as they plated it side by side. I am culinary trained in Thailand and this is the sickest joke on Thai food. Flies are joining me at my table too...is there any pride in doing a food business??",

      "text": "This is a self-service HALAL Thai restaurant where order is placed on touch screen panels and payment is either thru the screen or at the cashier. I ordered the BEEF BOAT NOODLE DELUXE which is the most expensive among the boat noodle menu @ $10.90 a bowl.  It has a generous serving of tender beef slices, brisket cubes, tendons, and beef balls. These assorted beef meat are so tender, complimented with enough serving of  thin noodles cooked 'al dente', on a sour-sweet-spicy broth that is so refreshing to sip and slurp. The serving size and the delightful taste of the dish definitely justify the price. I also ordered their original Thai iced milk tea @ $3.00.  I'm not a fan of milk tea but ordered it just for the experience.  Fortunately, it is not the heavily sweetened serving that milk teas are known for. I would recommend this place as they have lots of varieties in their menu. I will definitely come back and try some other dishes.",

I did like my combo that comes with beef noodles, mango pomelo sago and Thai milk tea. My colleagues like their too. Only thing is drinks are served separately and we almost forgot to go collect our drinks. All self service so no service given here….",
