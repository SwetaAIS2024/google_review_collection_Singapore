Jacob TAN,4,"This coffeeshop has many popular stalls here.
The roti prata, the fried hokkien me, the zhi char seafood stall and the claypot stall are popular.
I love the super crispy roti prata and the fried hokkien mee here.
The tea here is better than the coffee.
The coffeeshop is clean and has good air circulation.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
Flo Yeow,5,"As a coffee shop, they're definitely one of the cleaner and better ones around. The hokkien mee, the wanton mee, and the tse char stall, are already solid stalls on their own. The amount of fans they have, help with the afternoon heat. The seats as well, very well spaced. Overall a good lunch dining experience, nothing much to complain about.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
