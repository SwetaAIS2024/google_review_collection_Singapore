R H,5,"My family first visited the Korean ministry at CCMC a year ago in our search for a suitable Christian Korean community and have been attending since.

As my family is blended, we prefer a Korean speaking pastor with a balance of English. Pastor Park’s sermons were delivered in Korean supported by English translations on screen. Pastor Park’s sermons were simple, clear and earnest to us as a family.

Albeit the community is small, the size of the congregation is secondary to us and there is no such thing as a perfectly sized church as well. Most importantly, my family is at peace to what he shared from God’s word.

We welcome all Koreans and blended families looking for a community to grow in.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101884100042547368119/reviews
