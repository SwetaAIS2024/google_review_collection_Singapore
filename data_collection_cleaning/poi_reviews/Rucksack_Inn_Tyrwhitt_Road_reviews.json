She keeps threatening guests with fines for not following rules even before reading them out.\n\nThey had a power outage one full day but didn't even bother to acknowledge the trouble guests had to face in the hot summer and did not bother to provide alternative arrangements.",

      "text": "It’s my first day here, and so far, things have been quite decent. Rooms are average, services average, location is great.The female staffs are rude and were not particularly nice, neither accommodating when I requested a bed location change.\n\nThe room has lockers (not great quality) , water is available, and there’s a coffee spot. The shared bathrooms are j fine condition, though there’s only one dustbin in the whole washroom. They do provide hair dryers, but there are no tissue papers in the washrooms, which is a bit inconvenient. also the floors are always wet! plus no shoes allowed!!!\n\nThe women-only squad rooms always seem to be fully booked—I’ve been trying to get one for over a week now. The mixed squad rooms, on the other hand, are quite messy and not the best experience.\n\nThere are no curtains around the beds, so there’s zero privacy.\n\nOverall, it’s an okay place so far. I’ll update as I experience more.",

One door is missing to one of the shared bathrooms.\nThere is nothing to dry your hands with in the toilets/baths",
