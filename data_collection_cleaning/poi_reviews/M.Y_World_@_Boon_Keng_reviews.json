These skills go beyond any form of academic achievements as they form the core personality of my growing kid, all while retaining the kidâ€™s original identity of honing their curiosity, problem solving and critical application through play. Thank you to all teachers in MYWorld BoonKeng. Your dedication and love for the kids under your care can definitely be felt by both the children and their parents.",
