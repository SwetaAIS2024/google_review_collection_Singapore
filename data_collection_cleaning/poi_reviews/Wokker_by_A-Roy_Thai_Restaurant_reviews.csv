Mason Tay,3,I ordered the Tom Yum grilled chicken fried rice and the Pad Thai was not too bad. Unfortunately there was only 3 cubes of grilled chicken and hardly any egg traces. Fortunately I topped up a sunny side up egg and Chinese sausage. It was a really pathetic fried rice for $8.90. I am probably not too keen to return for fried rice. Itâ€™s no wonder there was no queue at all!!! My most honest opinion!!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108195777674730720034/reviews

Yong Kai Chung,2,Basil fried rice that did not taste or smell like basil at all. ðŸ¤¨ and I think you should use sturdier spoons. Not the standard of Aroy Thai,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109415194177952264721/reviews
olyvia s,5,"Tried the Thai style fried noodles, add on chili. Chili got kick & cooking time less than 10 mins! ""Might"" be better than their Pad Thai but i haven't tried this time. Definitely will come again next time",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113524097953722922763/reviews
