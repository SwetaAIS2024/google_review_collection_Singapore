      "text": "When they started,  their Indian dishes were one of the better ones in town but over time it progressively got worse. Now the shop \"lives up to its name - Gravy \" .  No matter what you order all that is really served will be a bowl full of gravy and a measly amount of meat or vegetables. I was foolish enough to try their mini buffet lunch again last week  after my earlier disappointing experiences . They had a couple of veg curries and a meat dish and like I mentioned above they were nothing but gravies in different colours. The meat that I managed to pick out from the gravy with difficulty tasted uncooked and stale. Shame on you , this is cutting corners taken to the next level.",

      "text": "I went on a considered big group (6 pax) on a Tuesday noon, lunch time and the service was really bad.\n\nThey asked us to scan from the QR code for the menu and the site is not managed properly (sometimes you will find menu stated multiple times, no pictures, says OOS but turns out in-stock). This was not the worst part yet.\n\nWe placed our order through the staff and we waited for 45 mins for the food to come out. We kept asking ‚Äúwhere is our food‚Äù, just to found out that the staff missed out our order from 3 chicken Teriyaki to 1 chicken Teriyaki. Then, they told us they run out of Chicken Teriyaki and can only serve 2 portions ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è After waiting for 45 mins and we were very hungry this was very upsetting. We ended up not getting all the orders we placed.\n\nThe food was not great either. We ordered dumplings for $16+ and it was out cold.. maybe it‚Äôs frozen (?) for the price we would expect something more fresh. The chicken teriyaki was also dry and served with basmati rice, which doesn‚Äôt go well with. (I understand this is an Indian restaurant, maybe better to order just Indian food)\n\nOverall, such a bad experience. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs due to peak hour or something. But not going to come back again.",
