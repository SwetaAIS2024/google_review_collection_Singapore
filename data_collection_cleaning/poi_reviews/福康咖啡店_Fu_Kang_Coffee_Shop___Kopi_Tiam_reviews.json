The atmosphere is lively yet comfortable, making it a pleasant spot for any time of day. Prices are reasonable across the board & finding a smooth, aromatic glass of kopi C for just $1.30 in a 24-hour eatery is practically unheard of. A real gem in Bukit Merah Central.",

      "text": "[Edit on 10/6/24] the non-alcoholic drinks are still on discount. Round of musical chairs: the Indian stall has moved to the back with a new Yong Tau Foo stall taking over its previous location. The dim sum stall has folded. A new western food stall, Deli Delight now occupies the space of the previous Jap-Korean stall, which in turn has moved to the space beside the fish steamboat stall.\n\nReview in 5/2024: Newly-revamped coffeeshop (opened 9/5/24) has more stalls and is brighter-looking now, with the drinks and Indian food stalls located prominently at the front compared to the last time when they were right at the back corners.\n\nNon-alcoholic drinks eg. tea/kopi are currently on discount (from $1) for 2 weeks from the opening date of 9/5/24. But the standard of the tehsi has dropped - the previous spectacled auntie is no longer working here.",

My friend also ordered one time but the crew forgot about his order until he followed up.\n\nThough the food was nice.\n\nThey accept Paylah or Paynow. Not sure if paywave or Grab QR they accept.\n\nThis place is looking nice after renovation. A lot more choices now.",
