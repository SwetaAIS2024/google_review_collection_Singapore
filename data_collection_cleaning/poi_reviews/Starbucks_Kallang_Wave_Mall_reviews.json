However, I did notice that the cafe was a bit warmer than expected and it seemed like the AC wasn't quite doing its job. Nonetheless, I appreciated the fact that it wasn't overly crowded, allowing me to unwind and relax after a hectic day.",

The place was not even crowded, not sure why they want to chase us out and even threatened to call police even though we left our things there for 30mins and came back for it.  Is this how you speak to customers?",

But avoid this Starbucks (at Kallang Wave Mall) in the early hours of the morning as the mall Aircon does not kick in until 9 plus. Before that it was really warm.
