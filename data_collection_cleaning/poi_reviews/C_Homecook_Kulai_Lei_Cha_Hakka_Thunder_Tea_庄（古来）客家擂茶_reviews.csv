Super Fragrance,3,"Ordered lei cha for with white rice for $5.50.

The serving size was large at least the bowl that it came with. The vege mix was good and pretty harmonious but just fall short of being great.

The cha wasn't very good. Very powdery and need to be well stired. Even then it was also not particularly tasty. While dipping the ingredients to the cha helps in enhancing the taste of the cha, it doesn't helps to elevate the vege. A pretty average dish by itself and below average when compares to others that i had.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
Sjy Zdb,5,"The preparation has a very clean feeling on the food. No black over used oil looks.

Clean. Truly low salt. Taste is great and the brown rice they use is good and cooked to a good softness.

The Yong tau hu bittergourd is not bitter!  And the meat in it is nice and fluffy.

Feels really like home cooked feeling. Well worth the $6. Dabao $0.30 as usual but I prefer to use their dabao bowl.  The Lei cha is arranged so nicely.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114041477819635012808/reviews
megan,5,"One minor thing: when I received the soup, it had to be stirred bc there were some cold solid bits of the vegetables? I‚Äôm guessing while the rest of the soup was warm. While the soup isn‚Äôt the best, it‚Äôs still not super herby and maintains the balance well

The outstanding thing was how all the components of the rice bowl came together - the vegetables were all so well seasoned (which isn‚Äôt usually the case for thunder tea rice) and crunchy and not bitter. It‚Äôs a vegetable lovers dream.
Tofu was also good too.

Also really value for money as compared to other thunder tea places out there! (6 for brown rice and add 1 for more vegetables)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100978343250742524720/reviews

At 5.5, the potion is generous

Vivian Lim,5,"The thunder tea rice was delicious, distinctly different from the commonly available versions.

The taste was lighter, and it was evident that a lot of effort went into preparing each bowl. The presentation was lovely and neat, while the broth was robust yet not overwhelming.

Overall, it was a very flavorful bowl of thunder tea rice.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104819170903913909687/reviews
