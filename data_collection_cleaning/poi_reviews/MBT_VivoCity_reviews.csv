This shoe shop is a hidden gem! The selection is fantastic, with trendy styles and classic options for every occasion, all at great prices. Pijul and the staff were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, taking the time to ensure I found the perfect fit. I left feeling confident and excited about my new shoes - definitely coming back for more!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112754272693289146236/reviews

F T,5,The salesperson took effort to find the sizes and also made good recommendations.  She was also very patient.  The selection was wide enough to suit different needs.  I walked out with 2 pairs of shoes.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101363070752665108896/reviews
Nicholas Lai,1,"Don't buy this shoe. It's worse than a cheap $30 shoe from Queensway despite the kind of price that u pay for it (cost me $159). The outsole dropped out and I made a complaint, the management said it was too worn out (after I wore for 11months from the day I bought). Put it this way.....all my shoes ranging from $30 to $259 never had such problem even after 2yrs of wearing, but this one is the worst. The only consolation is that the insoles r indeed comfortable. But I will never buy a 2nd pair from this brand forever.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113421033522934674445/reviews
