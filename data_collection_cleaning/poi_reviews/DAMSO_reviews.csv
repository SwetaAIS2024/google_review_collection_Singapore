Bryanna Leigh,5,I tried various types of rice cakes and they were all very delicious. It is great in many ways as a snack for children and as a snack gift for Malay friends. My Malay friends also enjoyed it and said it was delicious. I’ll go often! I ate hard and took only two pictures… hehe,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102475626731590968713/reviews
