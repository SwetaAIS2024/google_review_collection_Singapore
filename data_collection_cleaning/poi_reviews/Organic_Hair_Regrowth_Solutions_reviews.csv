Charmaine,5,"Consultant ms Venice and hairstylist, Jason Yu were friendly caring and patiently explained to me what scalp treatment I should go for. Price was affordable. Treatment makes my hair look shinier healthier and smoother. Scalp very clean and can be promoted to hair growth.

Clear,5,"Rizzen is really friendly and amazing as a hair stylist, I have been getting my hair treatment done by him, his services have never once failed me. Rizzen is also very careful with hair washing and make sures to check with me if I prefer warm or cold water every single time. Highly recommended!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107288527275166130468/reviews
Nantheini Naidu,5,"I am a regular for a few years now and truly enjoy the scalp and hair treatments offered here. The Argan oil treatments have supported in my hair growth, making it healthy too. Before treatments, one's scalp is analysed for the type of treatment needed for the day. My stylist is Mont and she is friendly and patient. She does good haircuts too!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117958002136675300068/reviews
