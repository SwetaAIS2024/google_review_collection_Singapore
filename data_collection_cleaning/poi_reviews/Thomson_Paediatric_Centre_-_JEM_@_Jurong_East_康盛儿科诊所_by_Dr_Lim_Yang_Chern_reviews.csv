Yiann Au-Quak,5,"Dr Lim was recommended by a PD friend of mine and I'm so glad to have been referred to him! He is now our preferred PD for all 3 kids. His accurate diagnosis, clear explanations and heart for the children and caregivers is very evident. I love that he also takes the time to explain the trajectory the illness is likely to take and what timelines to keep in mind so I can manage my own anxiety and know what to look out for the next time.

I will always remember him as the PD who gently told me we need to send my baby to the hospital in an ambulance and whose diagnosis was spot on. I was a mess but his calmness & quiet confidence helped me feel assured and well supported. Baby ended up being warded for a week but seeing you first was the best call we made. Thank you Dr Lim!! Can't thank you enough!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111263610303328876568/reviews
Missy Au,5,"Very organized queuing system, though you have to get in the online queue at exactly 8.45 am for a slot, as Dr Lim is very popular.

We have seen him a number of times now, and he has been nothing but really kind and patient to my son and us.

As a FTM, I am naturally a bit more worried whenever my son falls ill, but Dr Lim has a very reassuring presence and is able to diagnose and explain my son's symptoms in a very layman manner, making it easier for us to understand, as well as tips on how to make my son feel better after every bout of illness.

The reception staff at Jem are also very friendly to us, making the visit a lot less intimidating for my son.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113237030007512053001/reviews
Ng boonshuen,5,"A great paediatric doctor with extensive knowledgeâ€”very comprehensive, professional, friendly, and patient. Highly recommended. The online booking system is quite convenient, but it might be better not to repeatedly send messages about late charges, as parents with sick children are already under a lot of stress.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107024228619431280185/reviews
Nady Kiran,5,"It was my first time going to Thomson paeds centre at JEM. Came quite early but was told waiting time is 3 hours. It was my mistake for not checking the queue status. Hence I went back home to wait.  Received a text to make my way and once I reached, i was called in. Dr Lim was a very nice and friendly doctor. My son normally tends to cry during Dr visit. But Dr Lim knows how to make a child calm down and feel comfortable. Really glad I met Dr lim, he really assess my son properly and gave me advice on what to monitor. Some GP tends to rush the consultation but Dr Lim really listen to your worries and advice you accordingly. Gave my son a tidbits afterward. Thank you so much, I have found a permanent paeds Dr for my son. Also, the nurses are very friendly too. Thank you (:  god bless you all.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101025717561298467281/reviews
Weng Fei Wong,5,"My daughter have been seeing Dr Lim since she was 1 week old for her jaundice till now when she is turning 3 years old. I would say Dr Lim is the most patient and caring doctor that I ever met. His consultation always gave me assurance in my daughter condition and how long it took for her to recover.

Hope to see more of such good doctors around in Singapore. Only downside is the queue over at the clinic due to popularity of the doctor.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117384117835554015240/reviews
