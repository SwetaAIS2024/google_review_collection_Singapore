      "text": "Product or Service Quality\nI had their Iced Americano Regular House Blend (Dark), and it wasn't overly burnt or acidic. It was good.\n\nCustomer Service\nCustomer service was great. I was warmly welcomed at the start and bade farewell at the end. Coffee was served quickly.\n\nValue for Money\nThe price is average and comparable to most outlets.\n\nCleanliness and Environment\nThe place has a very cool, futuristic vibe that's worth a visit. The air conditioning was strong, and the music was nice. There are no tables, but that's not a major issue.\n\nConsistency and Reliability\nThis was my first visit, so I can't really comment on consistency.",

      "text": "Right in the middle of the shophouses along Beach Road, there’s a white-walled café with a sign that says “2050”.\nNaturally, I assumed it was some kind of futuristic-themed place…\nBut nope—it turns out the name is a nod to the real-world “2050 problem.” And oddly enough, that made me like it even more.\n\nThe interior? Minimalist to the max. Some might say stark. No unnecessary fluff—just you, your thoughts, and caffeine. The menu? Even more minimalist. No food, just coffee. They mean business.\n\nI ordered an iced coffee, which came from a tap—yes, a tap! It gave me vending machine vibes for a split second, but the aroma and flavor quickly reminded me this was no joke. Delicious and robust.\n\nThe staff didn’t seem like coffee scholars or anything, but hey, they didn’t need to be. The whole vibe is “keep it simple,” and they stuck to it.\n\nYes, the prices might be a tad on the high side—but honestly, with coffee this good, I’m not complaining. There’s no clear mention if proceeds go toward solving the actual 2050 problem, but I’d like to think that supporting good coffee is a noble cause in itself.\nHere’s to hoping we can keep sipping great coffee well into the future!",

Futuristic interior, very ig worthy.\n\nOrdered the matcha latte ($7.50), it was on the sweeter side, definitely satisfied my cravings. Would love to come back and try out other drinks\n\nService is lovely and amazing ❤️ thank you:)",
