MJ Bautista,5,"A lot of times, its the attention to detail that counts. Celebrated birthday here and was surprised with a personalized card with our photo sticked to it. The staff are also very attentive and always ready to help specially Lennie. They offer different cuisine - but choices are not overwhelming. The food is always replenished.
