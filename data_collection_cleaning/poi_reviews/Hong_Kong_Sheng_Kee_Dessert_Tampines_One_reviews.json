Set meal here are good offer in terms of cafe price.  Food quality is of benchmark. It's a good place if you want to eat and go. Not really recommend to linger longer as this place is quite messy at its seating area . Given it as a small store , it's forgivable.  Wan ton noodles have the chewy texture to it . Wan ton is large enough. If you crave for an HK food fix, this is ok enough.",

Not bad though the supposed star of the dish - the abalone - were like a couple of pieces, clearly missing from the action. Had the osmanthus lime with honey pearls to wash it down. All for sgd21.",
