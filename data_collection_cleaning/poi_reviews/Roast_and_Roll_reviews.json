They‚Äôre also receptive to feedback and are trying to move towards less plastic waste when dining in. Would recommend to my peers! :)",

The fried items are perfectly crisp, and all the ingredients look and taste fresh and clean. There‚Äôs also a great selection of condiments, including various sauces, peanuts, coriander, and spring onions. The only downside is that the waiting time can be quite long after ordering",

Cheap, good, quick and yummy. Not only that, free-flow condiments and they have such a huge variety as well ü•≤ Recommend for folks working at MBFC, where there‚Äôs a lack of such eateries!\n\nüìç: Roast & Roll @ MBLM",

There‚Äôs also a sauce station hdl-self service style which is unique!\n\nIt‚Äôs meant to be a takeaway joint so there‚Äôs no tableware besides takeaway boxes even if you choose to dine in at their little booth seats. So bring your own lunch box and cutlery to save on the waste.",
