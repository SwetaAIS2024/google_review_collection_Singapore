      "text": "I’ve been a student of Elaine Hamilton Grundy for close to 10 years now, I must say. Through these years, I have benefited immensely from her wisdom and insights, be it spiritual, mental and life in general. Elaine injects huge doses of reality and not one to let you off into the ethers ungrounded. Yet, she does so with humor that makes time with her enjoyable.\n\nEven though Elaine is now based in the UK, I still find that her nuggets of wisdom relevant and aligned with passage of time. As she evolves her beliefs, she extends her invitation for us to join her, but never with force.\n\nHer teaching of Reiki is fundamentally not just about Reiki as a universal life force; it also nudges us to challenge our belief systems, to broaden our perspective, because at the end of the day, we don’t know anything at all.\n\nThank you, Elaine, for being the beacon of light for so many of us!",

I have evolved as a person under her teachings and she is the best:). Another good thing is that the connection with Elaine and the Reiki community  continues life long through the beautiful Container she has created where we meet on a weekly basis for meditation and sharing.\nThe location is convenient with lovely eateries around. Wish the recent level 3 course that I attended lasted more than 3 days.",

She guides you through the theory and practice of Reiki in an incredibly open, welcoming and supported way while giving you a gift that expands your personal toolkit in a big way.

      "text": "Just finished a Level 3 class with Elaine Grundy. Elaine is a wonderful teacher who explains things very clearly. Her class is dynamic and fun filled. But mostly I appreciate that Elaine has been able to recognize that like everything else, Reiki and its practice is also evolving, and she is very open to new concepts and thoughts (with proper experimentation of course). No judgement of any sort from her or sense that if you don’t do things a certain way you’re doing it wrong. I highly recommend Elaine for anyone looking to learn Reiki.",
