Lida Tan,5,"Been coming to Beauty Reveal Salon for over a decade now, and every visit has been fantastic. The stylists are not only skilled but also genuinely care about their clients. And they always give great advice on hair care and styling. Highly recommend!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111639315004369493436/reviews

Crystal Low,5,Just had my hair done at here and I couldn’t be happier! The stylist listened to exactly what I wanted and the results exceeded my expectations. The staff were all incredibly friendly.

Shanthene 12,1,I would give a 0 star rating but that’s not possible. Very rude customer service. I would suggest any other salons than this. My mum went to cut hair and the man cutting her hair gave remarks on why her hair was very long and whether she had no money to cut. I mean???? My mum loves having long hair. She came there to snip 2 inches off. Such rude remarks were passed because he probably found it a hassle to cut long hair. Then he should have asked his colleagues to cut. Such a mediocre cut as well. Please refrain from going here. If it’s troublesome providing proper service.I think he Shouldn’t be working there in the first place.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108250538154678191819/reviews
Anna K,5,"Date of visit: 5/10/2023
Time: Around 8

Service:
Adult hair cut, wash and blow.
Child hair cut.
Total: $56

My child would get fussy and ""difficult"" to get her hair cut. However, the lady (did not get her name. A chinese lady with highlighted, shoulder-length hair) handled my child patiently and professionally. She managed to coax and quickly and safely get my child's hair done. Great service by her! Thank you!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107308457495002434996/reviews
