Rachel Yee,3,"Haven't had Swensen's in a very long while. Brought my family here because I had a voucher. Overall, food was okay and acceptable. The mala pasta was the nicest out of all the dishes we ordered. It was tasty and spicy. The ice cream was good, mint was our favourite flavour.

The service was a little slow, considering that there were very minimal customers that day and timing that we visited. We weren't attended to while queueing outside. We had to walk-in and find seats ourselves to get noticed by the staff.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111562434976540372363/reviews

Hamzah Rafi,5,"Food was nice, staff able to explain waiting/cooking times and food ran out and able to replace the chocolate fondue with other food items due to peak hours.

Not sure about the other reviews talking about seat having bugs, food not cooked properly so you have to dine there and judge by your own judgement.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114498186242334419287/reviews
