Lovie Li,5,"The quality of the meat is definitely top-tier among Korean restaurants in Singapore! The price is well worth it for the meat quality, and the sauces are tasty too — not the overly strong flavors you usually find at typical Korean BBQ buffets. The unlimited refillable side dishes are a big plus, and there’s even a complimentary vegetable platter.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107344900073399423562/reviews
Kheng Hui Soo,5,"The shellfish are so good! Fresh and sweet!
The Korean grilled pork belly is yums too!

Updated review in Jun to reflect the new menu:Must try the grilled squid! If you ask nicely you could also try off menu items e.g. 面疙瘩 (tomato egg soup base)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112910842940354899341/reviews
Jacqueline Ng,5,"Reasonable price and taste good. The chef is the boss. Very friendly. About $30 for the pork belly, clams, half pork trotter 猪手. The pork belly not very oily and the trotter very tender.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118244626130850601790/reviews
Ming Cheng,5,"This stall at the new Jurong West hawker centre sells Mainland Chinese cuisine. I tried the signature 水煮肉 and opted for chicken which cost $5, and added a bowl of rice for $1. They were very generous with the vegetables and there was a decent amount of chicken. Taste-wise, the dish was on the milder side, probably to cater to the Singaporean palate. It took quite a while to prepare the dish but I think the wait was well worth it!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117988198545701601245/reviews
menthe alow,5,"The chef has an amazing & kind attitude, spent a lot of time explaining in both English & Mandarin what's the most authentic combo.. and even demonstrated us how to properly compose our wraps & eat them! Highly recommend.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115146529120714214757/reviews
