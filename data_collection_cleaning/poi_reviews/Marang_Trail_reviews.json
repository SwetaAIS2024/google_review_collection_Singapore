      "text": "The Marang Trail at Mount Faber is a hidden gem for nature lovers and urban explorers in Singapore. Starting near HarbourFront MRT Exit D, this 400-meter trail offers a short but invigorating hike up to Mount Faber Park.\n\nThe path is surrounded by lush greenery, with towering trees providing shade, making it a serene escape from the bustling city below.\n\nThe trail primarily consists of stairs, offering a good workout as you ascend approximately 100 meters in elevation. While the climb can be challenging for some, the effort is rewarding with panoramic views of the city skyline, Sentosa Island, and the cable cars once you reach higher points. The trail is well-maintained, with clear signage ensuring you won’t get lost.\n\nPerfect for a quick nature retreat, the Marang Trail connects seamlessly to other attractions like Henderson Waves and Faber Peak. However, it may not be suitable for those with mobility issues due to its steep steps. Remember to wear comfortable shoes and bring water, as there are no facilities along the way.",

The trail is not long and takes around 15-20 minutes for someone of average fitness. The start is an uphill climb, hence can be a little strenuous. Not suitable if you have mobility issues",
