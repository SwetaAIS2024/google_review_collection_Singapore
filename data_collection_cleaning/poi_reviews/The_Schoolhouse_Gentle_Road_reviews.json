      "text": "My son started to attend The Schoolhouse Gentle Road at 18 months old. At such a young age, the principal and his class teachers were always very re-assuring and caring. They helped to ease the transition to school for both child and parent very well by always having a good communication line and by keeping us informed. Throughout the year, we have also seen continuous improvement by the school on the menu, curriculum, health and safety procedures for the children etc. Feedback is welcomed and always attended to. I trust the team at The Schoolhouse Gentle Road and I know that they always give their best. Thank you for providing a safe space for the children!",

      "text": "My children have been in The Schoolhouse Gentle Road since they were toddlers, and through all these years, have been well taken care of by all of the staff here. The teachers and the Principal of The Schoolhouse Gentle Road are very hardworking and genuinely care for the children and it shows in the way the Principal and the teachers constantly communicate with parents and promptly address any issues raised. The children’s classrooms are imaginatively designed with many opportunities for the children to explore and learn and even I find myself drawn to the creative play stations that the teachers have painstakingly spent time to create and set up. The support staff are equally competent and The Schoolhouse Gentle Road has an onsite Chef who prepares the children’s meals freshly every day. I have always felt reassured and confident leaving my children in their hands. Equally my children enjoy going to school every day and that’s how you know that The Schoolhouse Gentle Road has successfully created a warm, nurturing and caring environment for the children they look after.",

      "text": "It's a good school. When we chose between the Schoolhouse Gentle Road vs Etonhouse Newton, I booked meetings respectively with the principals at these two schools to compare.\n\nMs Pavai at the Gentle Road Schoolhouse impressed me a lot - she appeared to be a very passionate educator, shining with ideas about how young children should be educated and taken care of. I was convinced that a good leader leads to a good team, and chose the Schoolhouse.\n\nThat decision has not disappointed me so far after two years. All the teachers we have come across at the school have been impressive. What they have in common are their patience, passions and professionalism when dealing with the children.\n\nI have been to a few different school events/field trips as a parent - being able to experience days at school with our kid is great, and I can see that our kid enjoys the school very much.\n\nRecommend.",

The younger one enjoys going to school and the older one speaks fondly of how much fun The Schoolhouse was. The school encourages each kid to express themselves and have opportunities to explore.\n\nMs Pavai, who takes care of the branch is approachable and often checks in on the children. The teachers provide personalised updates on the progress of our children and extend assurance that the children are well taken care of.",
