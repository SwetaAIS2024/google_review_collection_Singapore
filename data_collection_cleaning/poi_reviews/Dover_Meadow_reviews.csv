M M,5,"Dover Meadow, nestled within the greater Dover Forest area in Singapore, provides a unique blend of natural greenery and urban accessibility. It's a spot that appeals to nature lovers, families, and those seeking a tranquil escape within the city. Here’s a review capturing the essence of Dover Meadow based on recent insights and visitor experiences.
Dover Meadow stands out as a serene green space situated within the historically rich Dover Forest, a secondary regrowth forest with roots tracing back to old plantation land. The area is easily accessible, with a well-maintained path connecting Dover MRT to nearby private estates, making it convenient for both locals and visitors. The meadow is kid-friendly, offering gentle hiking trails and open lawns that are perfect for family outings or a quiet stroll. Notably, the site is part of a larger ecological corridor, supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna, which adds an educational and immersive dimension to any visit. While parts of the broader Dover Forest are earmarked for future development, Dover Meadow retains its peaceful charm, making it a pleasant retreat for those looking to reconnect with nature without leaving the city. However, visitors should be aware that ongoing construction in the vicinity may affect certain areas, and the landscape is likely to evolve as urban plans progress.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114442474015223259254/reviews

Surrounded by the Anglo Chinese School, United World College of Southeast Asia - Dover Campus, Yale NUS college and University Town, as well as a private landed property area around.  There is a big pond in the middle of the trail though it looks not really well maintained.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106473378023729080154/reviews
