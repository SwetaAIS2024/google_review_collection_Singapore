tan junhao timothy,5,"My wife and I attended the Basic Barista & Latte Art at Nineteen95 the Espresso Bar, our first time experience was truly awesome and we surely left this course with a very good impression. Julian was a very very patient trainer and also very determine to find out our pouring mistakes during latte art. He constantly keep finding out what are the root causes in our pouring and gave us various solutions and alternatives to improve our pouring motions.
