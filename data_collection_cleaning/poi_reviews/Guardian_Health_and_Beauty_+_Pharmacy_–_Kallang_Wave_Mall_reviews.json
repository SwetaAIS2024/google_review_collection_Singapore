However, the Guardian group hardly ever keeps a pharmacist at this location anymore, so perscription/medical needs may not always be met.  Good for ‘health & beauty’ as the name implies.",

I pointed to her that I was trying out the tester. It was clearly labelled \"tester\". Can't she see it for herself? Please hire a more knowledgeable staff in the future.",

Was told by the cashier who was the only staff around to go check myself. I ended up buying my masks at the Fairprice Xtra .\nSo my experience/review about this guardian store is - the staff was extremely unhelpful.",
