Rozila Shukur,5,"The Newly Weds decided to hold their Big Day here without second thoughts. The moment they sign up....the service rendered has been an excellent experience. Firdaus the sales rep was very welcoming and the whole experience till the big day was excellent. Zubaidah took over the role and attended to all our questions with a smile....prompt replies whenever any last minute questions raised any time any day......she even did add on service by sending extra invitation cards personally. HER EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE deserves a TROPHY! GOOD JOB IN REPRESENTING THIS ESTABLISHED COMPANY. Her very composed character n always ready with a smile warms our hearts. Her professionalism on following the company protocols is superb. The whole ambience and food and service are all plus points. We highly recommend MUSLIM DELIGHTS as your ALL IN WEDDING PLANNER. SERVICE IS THEIR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

Izhar,4,"Tldr came for a wedding reception, left with a satisfied stomach and a gaping hole in the wallet where the wedding hongbao was.

Loved the live stations (roti kirai, satay and pisang goreng aka fries banana fritters). Seating is quite haphazard and the wedding dais is oddly positioned up high compared to seated guests, making a nice view of the dais from the seating area at the far back, hard.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107057289508191400718/reviews
