      "text": "Visited Capasso about three weeks ago for a dinner date with my girlfriend. The restaurant is located in the CBD area, so the price point was\ndefinitely not an issue for us ‚Äî we‚Äôve had our fair share of dining experiences.\n\nThe food was decent, the atmosphere was spot on ‚Äî cozy, classy, and perfect for a night out. Unfortunately, the service left a lot to be desired. Throughout the evening, we couldn‚Äôt shake off the feeling of being judged by the service crew. We received looks that made us feel like we didn‚Äôt belong there ‚Äî as if we couldn‚Äôt afford the place or were ‚Äútoo young‚Äù to be dining in such an establishment. Not to mention, we were served breadsticks in a ceramic jar instead of what others were served - on a plate?\n\nAt this price point, good service should be a given, and sadly, that was where the experience completely fell short.\n\nWould I return? Probably not ‚Äî great atmosphere and vibes with decent food, but the poor attitude from the staff was enough to ruin the night.",

And the Grilled Octopus Leg was sooo tender, I‚Äôm definitely ordering it again!\n\nFor meat lovers, you have to order their Beef Tenderloin, Braised Beef Cheek Tagliatelle, and Iberico Pork which were succulent and super satisfying!\n\nAnd the Duck Confit Dumplings were tiny pasta parcels of pure comfort.\n\nAnd you have to try their Deconstructed Blackforest Cake with rum jelly, simply delectable.\n\nThis is your sign to visit Capasso ‚Äî where every plate is a masterpiece and every bite, a love letter to your taste buds.\n\nHighly recommend this restaurant for the wonderful dining experience, vibrant flavours and warm hospitality.",
