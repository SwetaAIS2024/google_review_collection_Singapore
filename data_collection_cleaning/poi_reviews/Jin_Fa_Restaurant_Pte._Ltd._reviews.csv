Luo BX,4,"New stall sellig  white based wanton mee
Price wise starting at $5
But for the amount of noodle and char siew worth it
Noodle is springy with fresh lard oil coating the noodles.
Wanton is full of ingredients and char siew is more towards hong kong style
Can give it a try if you are there and the prata queue is too long.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112065381384311659907/reviews
James HO,5,This is my rare 5-star rating. The girl ask me if I need drink and I told her I want coffee but I need to wash my thermal flask first. She told me never mind she will rinse for me. This is service excellence in a heartland mall coffee shop.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109223800025383170610/reviews
Daphane Yeo,4,"Was there for breakfast.
Roti prata really shiok.
But the curry chicken was a disappointing.
The coin prata is crispy, it makes you crave for more.
Drinks store breakfast set is yummy. Especially their toast bread. Can literally see every table ordering that.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114489802076023034625/reviews

Flo Yeow,4,"As a coffeeshop under the HDB block, this coffeeshop is surprisingly crowded. Especially on weekends, people who have just visited Macritchie Reservoir will come by after their morning walks. They have a few good stalls here, including the Sin Ming Roti Prata, the vegetarian food, the Popiah, and the chicken rice. The Sin Ming Roti Prata is especially crowded, but they're also worth every minute of waiting time!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
