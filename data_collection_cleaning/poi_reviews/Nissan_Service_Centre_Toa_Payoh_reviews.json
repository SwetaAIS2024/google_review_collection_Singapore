Customer service person could not answer me if the car was held up at servicing side or long queue for washing. Wanted to feedback to management regarding the long wait for a 5k servicing but was told to wait for someone to speak to me. Left the place without giving any feedback as I could not wait anymore. This place really need to improve in it's service standards and look into how to reduce its waiting time for car servicing.",

      "text": "Quite a long wait due to lack of manpower on 26 Dec (perhaps year-end staff clearing leaves) despite having an appointment. My appointment time was 9am but was only served around 9.45am. Would have given a lower rate if not for one of the staff's (Kumar) professionalism. He was very patient even though I requested for my car to be left at the service centre as I had to rush off for another appointment. Thanks for your service, Kumar!\n\nJust my 2 cents: Perhaps the centre should not take in too many appointments if they are lack of manpower. This will affect the overall service rating as customer wait times are longer.",

      "text": "Had a faulty aircon on my 2018 Nissan Qashqai. This service centre took 3.5 hours to “diagnose” the issue, claimed that many parts (compressor, condenser, cooling coil, cooling coil sensor) need to be replaced and quoted $3,400 + 2 days to repair. The attitude by the “technical officer” was condescending and unhelpful. They also said that they are understaffed - apparently only 3 mechanics to work on 30 cars upstairs.\n\nI went to a different workshop which took less than 2 hours to pinpoint the issue (a jammed compressor) and replace the compressor which solved the problem for $708.50.",

Perhaps they can improve in this parts. Even so is a compliment washing after servicing but didn’t do a good job, their skill honestly is worst then those petrol station skill.\n\nI was attended by Kumar Sales man, with his clear explanation and time allowance toward customer expectations is good. Trying his best to speed up and clear the process. My car is new, so far don’t give me any problem yet.\n\nHopefully they can improve their after sales service for washing part",
