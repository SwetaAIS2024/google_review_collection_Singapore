N,5,"In my consultations with RCL Chambers, I was impressed by the team’s sound guidance and professionalism. In particular, Joint MD John Lo's extensive litigation experience and meticulous attention to detail shone through; his advice was precise and easy to understand. Definitely a team I would confidently engage to support my legal endeavours. Thank you for your hard work and exceptional service.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103129191464912475363/reviews
stanley lim,5,"When looking for lawyers, the top few criteria (at least for me) include:
1.	Expertise and experience: the ability to break down difficult concepts into information that man-on-the-street can understand. It’s always a plus point if they could illustrate similar situations that they have encountered.

2.	Responsiveness: The last thing I would want when dealing with matters of the law would be to have to struggle with timely responses.

3.	Cost and Value: ‘Nuff said.

I’ve had quite a fair bit of dealings with the team when my family and I had separate personal matters to deal with. I think it’s fair for me to say that the team had been professional and have more than exceeded the expectations based on the above 3 criteria.

Not every lawyer places emphasis on the well-being of the client and have high EQ to manage already stressed out clients/prospects – this firm does that well.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105583237861465582841/reviews
