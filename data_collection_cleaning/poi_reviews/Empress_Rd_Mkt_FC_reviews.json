      "text": "First time at this market buying fishball noodles and laksa at stall #01-89. Food was decent but attitude of the lady server was TERRIBLE. Totally no customer service. I made my order and told the lady I wanted two bowls, small without chili. She shouted back just say two bowls small. Then she yelled again, take the tray, why stand there and wait. Well, in the first place, the cook was not even cooking my orders yet. Even if so, she can just let me know politely. by shouting and yelling isnâ€™t going to make anyone feel better. This is my first and last time coming. No matter how nice the food can taste. The customer experience sucks.",
