Rosh Lally,2,"Went by to order the golden fries. There was no one at the front. I had to call the person in the kitchen. Told them my order. They came out 15mins with the box and started packing. I asked for extra seasoning on my fries and the guy wasn't happy about it. Something other branches happily oblige. He gave an excuse saying no container and than finally goes to put 1 spoon of seasoning in a tiny container. Such a joke.

Went home within 15mins because the staff fully closed the container the fries were soggy. But best part is fries taste different clearly not the same brand and type as before. It's thicker and also not well cooked. Anytime pref the initial fries that was used. Definitely not pleaser with the service. Not going back to this branch and if the fries is permanently changes I won't be getting this dish.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106475832796025128984/reviews

Dominique Low,1,"Ordered a pint of Guinness but for some reason the staff was really unfriendly with everything. I tried to be courteous with greetings and all, so I can‚Äôt be accused of showing a bad attitude. If you are looking to have a cool off after work, I recommend taking your business somewhere else in NEWEST. Plenty of other nicer bars around offering better services.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117976703242447404147/reviews

Gareth Chen,5,Newly opened at NeWest.. the food was tasty and priced well. They have a very limited selection of beer with their focus being more on hard liquor.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102286937499133010807/reviews
