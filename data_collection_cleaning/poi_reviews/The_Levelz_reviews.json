For at least a half year, Jacuzzi wasn't working and currently all the treadmills in the gym is out of order for about three weeks. The maintenance staff do not know when it will be fixed since the boardmembers haven't approved the budget regarding the cost for fixing them. This has been quite disappointing that they cannot simply let tenants know when the treadmills can be repaired.",
