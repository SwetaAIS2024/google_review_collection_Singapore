To the right is all buns, but to the left are onion pancakes, chive pancakes, sauerkraut & pork pie, scallion pancake, and way more. The pancakes seem to be pretty large as well.\n\nUnlike the other stalls near it, they don’t have a ton of options but the ones they do have are quite delicious and still attract a lot of customers and with good reason. Overall, great place to quickly stop by for a good snack.",
