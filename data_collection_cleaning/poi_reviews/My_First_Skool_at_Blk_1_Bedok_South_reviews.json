      "text": "My daughter has only been in this centre since she was an infant (she is currently 4YO) so I’m unable to compare our experience with other schools.\nIn my honest opinion, I have only positive experiences with this MFS Bedok South centre (BC3) all thanks to their team of dedicated, caring and passionate staff. I am impressed by their well-thought out curriculum, programmes and the various initiatives the centre have implemented throughout the years, and always appreciated the honest and constructive feedback given by the teachers in order to best support my child’s development and learning. I can see that all the staff (be it teaching or non teaching) have the heart for the children, and will go above and beyond to ensure quality education for them. I also like how the teachers will also get parents to be as involved either through their home learning support activities or inviting parents to do sharing at the centre. So much innovation in the monthly events, learning journeys and activities conducted! We have no regrets whatsoever sending our daughter here, and will highly recommend this centre. My daughter loves going to school and that’s a testament to amazing (HEART) work of the staff there! Thank you so much ❤️",

      "text": "I feel that the teacher disrespects the parents very much, is too subjective, and can even criticize the parents! I originally wanted to send the child there so that the child could get in touch with other people and enjoy the growth process of happiness and learning. However, when faced with teachers who criticized parents, they could only swallow their anger for the sake of the child, which made me feel really uncomfortable. If you are a parent with low education, everyone suggests that this is not a good choice.",
