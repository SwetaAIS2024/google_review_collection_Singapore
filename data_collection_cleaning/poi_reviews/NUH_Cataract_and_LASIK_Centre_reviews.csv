Stephanie Rawlinson,5,"Met Dr Dawn Lim who was very patient in explaining the process of cataract surgery. From what I observed, all the staff were very polite and kind to the elderly folks.

boon lin lee,3,"visited on 26/8/24. the receptionist, person at registration/payment kiosks and refraction staff were excellent in their service-respectful and polite. Keep up the fantastic work!
The doctor Vivien Lim SY was brusque. Didn't even bother to return my greeting, spoke without looking at me, didn't ask if I had questions, etc. I get she's highly educated and qualified, but was there a need to act arrogant to older folks?",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105800909441921149755/reviews
Tan Orange,5,"I had cataract operation done by Dr. Laurence Lim, Senior consultant from NUH Medical Centre, Eye Surgery Centre and I'm grateful for his fantastic job.

The procedure went fast and smoothly, and my vision has greatly improved. Dr. Lim and their team were incredibly caring and professional throughout. My family's members had their operation done by the same Doctor as well.

Highly recommended for his skill [fast and steady], professionalism, patience and empathetic. You can have your choice to book for your cataract surgery done by Dr. Laurence Lim.
