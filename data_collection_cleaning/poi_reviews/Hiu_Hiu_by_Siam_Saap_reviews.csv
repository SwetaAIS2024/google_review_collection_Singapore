Jacko Lim,5,"The food here is absolutely amazing! The pineapple fried rice was perfectly cooked, with juicy pineapple, tender shrimp, and just the right amount of seasoning. The tom yum soup had a bold, aromatic broth that was mild spicy, sour, and packed with fresh seafood. The green curry was creamy, rich, and vegetable dishes were tasty. Every dish was bursting with authentic Thai flavors — simply delicious from start to finish.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107002793625263735733/reviews
Sin Ee Toh,5,"Chanced upon this excellent spot for authentic and delicious Thai cuisine. Every dish we tried was outstanding. The pineapple fried rice was perfectly balanced with sweetness and savory notes (bonus points for the generous portion of floss and cashew nuts!). The Phad Thai had just the right amount of tang and spice, the Tom Yum soup was refreshingly flavourful with a kick, and the green curry was so creamy, fragrant, and full of depth. Highly recommend for anyone craving a satisfying Thai meal!

Florencia,5,"As a repeat customer, my experience at Hiu Hiu has only gotten better with each visit. This place has truly become one of my favorite spots for Thai food.

The atmosphere is always inviting and cozy, with the perfect balance of casual comfort and vibrant decor. Whether it's a quick lunch or a leisurely dinner, the ambiance sets the perfect tone for a great meal.

The service here is consistently excellent. The staff is always friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They’re happy to offer suggestions based on your preferences, which makes the experience even more enjoyable.

Now, onto the food: I’m never disappointed. The dishes are full of authentic Thai flavors, and there’s a fantastic range of options for all tastes. The Phad Thai is consistently my go-to, perfectly balanced with the right amount of sweetness, spice, and tang. The portions are generous, and every dish is nicely presented.
To pair with my food, my favorites is their lemongrass drink, which I always order whether served cold for a refreshing pick-me-up or hot for a soothing, aromatic experience.

Whether you're a first-timer or a repeat customer like me, I highly recommend Hiu Hiu for an unforgettable Thai dining experience. It's a spot that continually delivers both in taste and hospitality, and I look forward to my next visit ❤️",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115760074205568746405/reviews
Eddie Sit,5,"One of the best Thai food I’ve had in Singapore. Been here multiple times to say that food is definitely consistent. The omelette is as close as you can get compared to very nice restaurants in Thailand. Green curry chicken is also very good.

I also love the decor and the themed posters and the thoughtful designs!

Highly recommended.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114303931943494067190/reviews
