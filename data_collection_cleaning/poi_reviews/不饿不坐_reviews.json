The grilled stingray was aromatic and well-seasoned, definitely a must-try. I was also impressed by how fresh the stir-fried dishes were — you can really taste the quality of the ingredients. On top of that, the service was excellent. The staff were friendly, attentive, and made us feel very welcome. Overall, a wonderful place to enjoy a satisfying meal with great food and service. I’ll definitely be coming back again with friends and family!",

      "text": "Is nestled in the vibrant Punggol East Container Park, this alfresco dining spot is really perfect place to kick back, relax, and dive into some seriously delicious Chinese cuisine.\n\nThey have from sizzling grilled skewers to comforting hotpot and mouth-watering stir-fried dishes.\n\nWe got the Clams with Pig Stomach Hot Pot Soup – it’s a bowl of pure comfort. The broth is so rich and flavorful, it’s like a warm hug for your soul. Pair it with fresh ingredients and you've got a meal that’ll make you feel all cozy inside.\n\nThe broccoli and scallop dish are just as impressive.\n\nWe also got the sambal stingray which a pity is on the bone side so not much meat.\n\nBtw, the service is top-notch! The staff is super friendly and attentive, making sure you’re having a great time throughout your meal. Plus, it’s a super kid-friendly spot, perfect to bring the whole family along.",

Don’t miss their skewers — it’s china style and tastes really authentic, like what I’ve had on my travels to China. Portions are also very good.\n\nApart from the food, service was impeccable, and they cater very well to young children as well.\nThey have kids’ cutlery and high chairs here, so parents need not worry.\n\nOverall, highly recommended !",
