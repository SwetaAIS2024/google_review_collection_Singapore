Anna,5,"My child has been with Etonhouse  since 2017.

I choose EH initially because of the welcoming student culture and smaller class size;  during orientation the students were curious about her asking if she was going to be become a classmate. They seemed happy and were very inclusive.

I've watched my daughter transform from a quiet wallflower into an enthusiastic learner who confidently shares her thoughts and opinions, has a stronger sense of self, and better socially navigates peer relationships.

The faculty have been observant and attentive, taking an active interest in her wellbeing, and responsive with a sense of compassion and willingness to listen to any concerns I've had.

The gender balance in her particular class could be better, as there are several more boys than girls, but this has not impacted the social aspect of her educational experience. As she's become more confident she has cultivated friendships outside of her immediate class.

Our experience has been positive; if you're considering EH secondary for your child and have any questions, please reach out.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112594219681128454340/reviews
