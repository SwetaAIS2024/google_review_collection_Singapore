      "text": "The food here is yummy & pretty good value too (price & portion wise).\nThey have quite limited drinks promo/ deals compared to other pubs.\nService is decent too.\n\nThe only ‚Äòless than pleasant‚Äô experience is with the Tex Mex Fajitas - it tastes good & the meat portion is quite generous but they only provided 2 small pieces of fajitas wraps, which is clearly insufficient for the portion of meat. So we asked if we can get more wraps & they told us yes, but they would have to charge for them. Happy to pay for it but it would have been nice for them to give 1 or 2 more wraps as part of the meal.",

However the second round of wings were a little bland compared to the first round. Nonetheless, value for money at $9.9+ per pax. Ivy's service was good and fast.",
