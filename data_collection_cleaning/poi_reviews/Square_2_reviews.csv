Florence Leow,5,"🟨 My husband and I come to Novena Square 1 and 2  at Novena Square mall quite often. 🟠 This medium-sized mall is just one train station away from Toa Payoh MRT station ( where we live).

The historical facts
************************
🟧 I know this area pretty well, because I saw the development of the Novena area throughout the decades when I was growing up. ✳️ You see, we used to live nearby here.

🟦 Novena Square Mall is actually built on top of a previous Jewish cemetery in the late 1980s. ✅️ First, they removed the entire cemetery and built the Novena Station in 1988.

🟠 ✅️Then later on, over various stages= they build Novena Square 1, then Novena Square 2, and lastly, they added the Velocity wing to it.

🔵  There are lots of eateries, restaurants, cafes, retail shops, and two major supermarkets here ( 🟢 Don Don Donki and Cold Storage supermarkets).

🟫 All in all, this Novena Square mall above Novena MRT Station serves the needs of the surrounding office towers, the hotels nearby and the condominium homes around it.

✳️ Novena Square 1 & 2 at Novena Square mall are directly connected to Novena MRT station. ☑️ Very convenient to access.

🟠 Novena Mall is also connected to Tan Tock Seng Hospital via a link bridge on level 3.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
Abu Faris,4,Easily accessible by public transport - served by novena MRT (north south line ♥️).

Wendy,4,"Don’t really like this mall due to the crowd. And the link between Square 2 and Velocity (Square 1) can be quite confusing. Took me about 10 visits to finally be able to venture around without getting lost.
There are quite a few of my favorite eateries there, so I will still visit occasionally.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102912341229303092422/reviews
Founder Media,3,"Square 2 shopping small is usually busy on weekends, it as all required shops and more of eateries. Advantage for people visiting Sqaure 2 is, it is connected to Velocity shopping mall, so choices are more. If you don’t like something S2, just walk into Velocity. It as Kofu Food Court, however, most of the stalls are vacant except 3-4 stalls occupied.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110334546460694982273/reviews
