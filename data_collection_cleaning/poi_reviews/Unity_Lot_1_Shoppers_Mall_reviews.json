      "text": "I visited Lot 1 Unity on March 29, 2025, to buy a supplement to help with wound recovery and boost my immune system. Unfortunately, the new hire pharmacist on duty was mocking me along with the Malay Unity staff, showing a lack of care and respect.\n\nHowever, the promoter from Holistic Way provided excellent service and proved to be a trustworthy person. She not only guided me to the counter for payment but also helped me place the item in my bag, knowing that I couldn‚Äôt squat due to my surgery, as I was experiencing severe bleeding. She even advised me to rest at home and take medical leave. I truly appreciate her kindness and professionalism.\n\nUnity Pharmacy should consider hiring better staff, especially the Unity staff, as the newly hired pharmacist‚Äôs behavior was unacceptable. Customers deserve respect and proper service.",

      "text": "I went to Unity Pharmacy at Lot 1 on March 29, 2025, and was very upset with the service. The new pharmacist, a lady, was disrespectful, and the Unity promoter staff, a Malay and a Tamil lady, were laughing at customers and talking behind their backs. This only made things worse for people who were already sick.\n\nI didn‚Äôt say anything to them and just ignored it, but it‚Äôs hard to ignore such unprofessional behavior.\n\nThe only person who treated me well was the promoter from Holistic Way. She was kind, helpful, and showed respect.\n\nUnity Pharmacy really needs to hire better staff. If this keeps happening, it will harm their reputation. Customers deserve respect and should be able to shop without being treated badly.",

      "text": "Good customer service from the staff, but the management should seriously consider hiring better pharmacists. The one on duty today was extremely racist and did not even bother to attend to us despite us standing there for a few minutes, looking at the medications. Spoke to us like we were illiterates and did not bother giving us any kind of additional information about the medicine we were enquiring about. Very rude and curt, and she made us feel like we were bothering her. I don‚Äôt understand how she can be hired as a professional when she displays such attitude towards minority races. I really hope the management can look into this matter and hire better pharmacists who are willing to provide help to the customers.",

The Tamil staff, who was at the cashier seems to be day dreaming.  I was queuing at the cashier but when it was my turn,  she refused to serve me,  and instead asked the customer behind me to come forward.  It need the help of the Malay staff to tell her that I was indeed in the queue,  and she reluctantly serve me üò°üò°",
