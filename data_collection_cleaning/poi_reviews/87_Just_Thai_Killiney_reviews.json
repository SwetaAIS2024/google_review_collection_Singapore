Sitting space can get a bit limited and if you have to sit outside during lunch it can get quite warm. Best to come slightly early or maybe after the rush hours.",

      "text": "This is a well-recommended joint by many who persuaded me. Anyway, it is a family outing here.\n\nWe got recommended some items from the menu (good for 4) :\n\n- Tom Yum Seafood Red Soup $9\n- Stir Fried Prawn with Thai Yellow Curry Poudar $15\n- Deep Fried Century Egg with Basil Pork $11.9\n- Thai style Pork Knuckle $15\n- Deep Fried Grouper n Mango Solad $29\n- Claypot Tang Hoon Prawns $15\n- Deep Fried Garlic Chicken $9\n\nWe ordered a mix of the common items and items we have not tried before.\n\nFor items like Deep Fried Century Egg with Basil Pork (new to us), it’s like 2 dishes in one.  Similarly with the crispy but not dry Grouper and sour but not overly spicy Mango salad, it’s also like 2 dishes of Fish and Somtam. All of us really enjoyed the Grouper and Mango Salad.\n\nThe stir-fried prawns with yellow curry powder has an eggy base which goes well with rice.\n\nThe Pork Knuckle came up very tender which my dad loved the easy bite and flavours.\n\nTheir Tom Yum soup is a must have. Our red soup version was quite creamy.\n\nThese guys have been around for a while starting with their first outlet in Pasir Panjang (moved to Holland Village) and overheard that they could be expanding to cope with the demands.\n\nExpect great service as well.",
