      "text": "Thank you! to the awesome team at Cash Converters Jurong Eastâ€”Niz, Eric, Wee, Wong, and Melvinâ€”for their fantastic service during the recent event organized by my condo management.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped in, they were all super friendly and welcoming. The team was easy to talk to, super flexible, and went the extra mile to make sure everything went smoothly during the process.\n\nWhat really stood out was how customer-focused they were. Whether it was answering questions, offering helpful suggestions, or just being genuinely attentive, they made the whole experience feel personal and stress-free.\n\nItâ€™s not every day you come across a team thatâ€™s both professional and so down-to-earth. Thanks again for the great serviceâ€”you guys made a great impression! :)",

      "text": "rejecting my bags which are in pretty good condition just because there were 'aerosol' smell and implying that we sprayed it inside the bags. As a bag 'expert' that you guys claim you were, shouldnt you not know bags that were kept in a cupboard for a long period of time tends to have smell lingers in them?\n\nand rejecting bags that you claim has a smell in them will deter ladies customers from buying them. So how do you explain bags that are currently in your store waiting for people to buy then? Many of your bags in store are in pretty much bad shape though? Most were cracked, dont get me started on the smell too. So, before rejecting items, please do your due diligence and PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH because neither of the items sold in your store was in perfect condition either.\n\nIn all honesty, people go to your store to sell what is not needed anymore. You are not some 'high-end luxury' store that people should come in with bags or items that are in top notch condition. Best believe that if you sold an item today, it will take month & years for people to come & purchase. dont get me started on your staff(guy) on the right side of the counter who apparently seems to cant take the bags out from the dust bag on his own. Reason being? are you having some mobility issue? What kind of customer service is that?",
