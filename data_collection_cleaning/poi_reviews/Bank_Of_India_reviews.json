They said they'll do it. When I reached there after 30 min travel they said they'll charge $10 and if I want I can complete the formalities myself by emailing the Indian bank. They could have told me this before.\n\nI expressed my dissatisfaction but not even a sorry came from them and the staff just walked away. Worst service experienced.",
