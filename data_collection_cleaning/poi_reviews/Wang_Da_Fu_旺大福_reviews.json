      "text": "Been wanting to try this place given the good reviews. It’s a lovely homely izakaya spot.\n\nI went when it was quite crowded so service was a little slow given it’s a one man show by Philip ( his wife helps on weekends) but honestly was a good change in this hustle and bustle of Singapore and there was a sense of calm having beers and have longer conversations over dinner and seeing Philip whip up our dishes.\n\nDishes tried: cucumbers, dong po rou (braised pork belly), torched Chinese sausage, fried rice, Suan pan zi( a haka dish- think of gnocchi but taro/ tapioca based), prawns in chilli oil, kimchi ramen, chilli oil dumplings\n\nDishes recommended: Suan pan zi\n\nDishes I’ll skip: cucumber, fried rice, kim chi ramen\n\nIt’s named after their two dogs which I found rather lovely. I would recommend this as a nice homely spot for a nice chill dinner when you have the time to escape the hustle and bustle of this city",

      "text": "Chanced upon this place while I was just googling for places to dine in at Katong. The place was a small cosy izakaya space. Menu was small as it's known to be more of a drinking place. When we arrived, the place was completely empty, felt like we actually booked the entire restaurant.\nThey do have daily specials or mains as well. We ordered quite a few to try: Suan Pan Zi, Chilli Oil Dumplings, Kong Bak Bao, Oysters, Pidan Egg with Tofu and the Chicken Stew (special for the day). Really enjoyed the food  all  tasted very good as well.",

      "text": "Quaint little bistro serving simple dishes - Chinese food based menu with some variety of sake and whiskey. The place is small - with the exception of about two tables on the outside, the seats are all by the bar and probably sit about 7 pax inside.\n\nIt’s a one-man operation so service is limited. The proprietor will acknowledge that whenever a customer comes in and he feels he is stretched.\n\nThe food is ok, but a little inconsistent. Sometimes can taste great but at times leaving me a bit wanting.",

The owners take pride in their dishes— their Suan Pan Zi, Ma Po Tofu, wantons in chilli oil are our personal favourites.\n\nWarm, friendly, down-to-earth people, with good attention to service. We usually end up staying longer than we plan for because there is such a great vibe there.",
