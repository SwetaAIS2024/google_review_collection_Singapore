Noticing my mobility issues, he proactively offered to serve me personally, insisting on making my experience seamless. His empathy and kindness left a lasting impression!

Toast Box clearly prioritizes customer care and empowers their staff to deliver exceptional service. I'm grateful for this outstanding experience and can't wait to return! Please recognize and celebrate the excellence of your team members - they embody the true spirit of hospitality!

michael lin,4,"Ordered the floss toast set for $6.60. Coffee nice and strong. Eggs came whole and you have to crack them open yourselves. They are the usual Singaporean very soft runny kind, so watch out when cracking them open. Do it over the bowls provided! Toast a bit dry, pork floss ok - think it‚Äôs sprinkled with a squeeze of honey? Would have preferred it not cut into 9 small squares, but rather let me do the cutting - may have not dried out as much. Filling if not particularly nutritious breakfast!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101093200154303210000/reviews

Marklin Ho,4,"Arrived just after peak lunch hour üï∞Ô∏è and was quite surprised that the counter staff does not look exhausted üòÆ hope they get some rest during less crowded timings

Queue was cut quite swiftly even though there were four customers in front of me ü©∑ received my hot coffee almost immediately and even though it‚Äôs not Melburnian quality, it does get the job done ü©µ luncheon meat and egg sandwich ü•™ is recommended if you need some quick energy before returning to your office. Overall, a stellar atmosphere as long as you have your earphones on üéµ",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108645548840717486453/reviews
cse1217,5,"Toast box is a great place to meet over a cup of coffee. I enjoy meeting friends at toast box. However, most of the time there's always a queue.

I love to look at the bubbles of the coffee. It's has nice aroma and nice to drink.

There is high table and those normal seats at Novena Square outlet. Environment is bright and clean.

Their curry chicken noodles and mee rebus is nice.
