Patrick Ong,5,"Bus stop is infront of VALOUR PRIMARY SCHOOL (New School,Started since 2021).

Update: 20Mar2024.
With the MRT Station construction on going.
•Crossing over to opposite side in order to catch a Bus(especially in the Morning and during Rain Season) become VERY VERY INCONVENIENT!!
•LTA or MRT Management. Pls consider again the BLOCKS OF OBSTACLE to re-design it, so Commuter will be easier to cross over to either of the sides of the road at this area....

I will continue to update and give feedback at this matter(abt the Blocking of the Road,causing Inconvenience to the commuter).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104029781504080345815/reviews
