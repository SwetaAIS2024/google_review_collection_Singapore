Audrey L,4,"There is so crowded outside where people keep walking around, we chose the indoor dining to avoid the crowd. A lot of choices in the menu, can get western or Indian, price is average.

Ravioli is tasty with the sauce but the filling is just okay, maybe not what we like. The lamb satay is flavorful but not strong in the lamb smell.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106228869753266299155/reviews
AjitThandi,5,"Lived in SG for many years but have moved back to the UK, and Arab street was always a go to for a relaxed environment and some beers with friends (and a snack). I was visiting SG and friends said where shall we meet, and the answer was simple Arab street (for beers, a bite to eat and a catch up). We were walking around and could not get a decent table at our regular joint (blue jazz) so took stroll and came across Madd Pizza!!!!

staff were super friendly so cautiously we all agreed to enter.

Draught beer selection - excellent
Food - excellent
Service - whats the word for better than excellent?? (Our server was a guy called Serwan (probably spelling that wrong))

This was a very random visit but going forward there is so much things on the menu I want to try as the Pizzas we had were amazing (not trying to denigrate blue jazz as i know we will always go back there but the food is not comparable. I always say that Blue Jazz has a great atmosphere but the only thing the food is good for is lining the stomach)

We all said that from now on we will meet at this place to start the night and catch up as its fantastic.

Madd Pizza was for me the new place to meet for beers and food.

They also have an indian restaurant next door, which is a bit random but menu looked great so will be trying that before I head back.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104196068298836031057/reviews
Daiana Peres Nunes,5,"This place is really amazing. The atmosphere is very nice, the staff is very attentive and the food is amazing. We ordered draft beer during Happy Hour and to go with it, Eggplant Pizza - surprisingly tasty with a crispy crust and juicy and hearty filling and Parma ham sandwich with arugula, simply wonderful, the dough is very airy, soft and crispy at the same time. You have to try this place when you are visiting Haj Lane.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117470994101580713144/reviews
Zhi Hao Chua,5,"Great place! The pizza recommended by the staff was delicious. We booked it for a company dinner, and the indoor seating was perfect for our group of 16. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Definitely a 5-star experience!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101302169508381699649/reviews
Cheng Wei Chik,5,"They serve great pizzas here, which are Roman-style elongated pizzas that’s cut and served in rectangle. The portions are pretty large, each slice of pizza is actually divided into 4 more slices. The table service was also terrific, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves eating here.

Their online delivery services didn’t work for me when I tried within the last couple of weeks. It was likely an isolated incident. The payment went through and I received a confirmation email, but … there was nobody on the pizzeria end to note the order. The food just didn’t arrive. We eventually got through to their phone number, but it was too late to salvage the night. The owner did get back to me a couple of days later on this unfortunate turn of event, and at the end of it, the mistake was rectified. It’s a 5 star for the service recovery as well. I don’t think this is a widespread issue, and it’s a testament to their pizza and their wonderful service recovery that I’m not put off ordering from them again. (But the next time I order delivery, I’ll drop them a message too, just to be on the safe side.) But! Anyway, you’ve got a happy customer and 5/5 stars.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102443032974462854302/reviews
