The lady who assisted me, she usually the only person in the office so far as well as the reception officer(she). Without both of them helping me on the digital bank statement, I would not learn a new digital way in my mobile.  To me, I'm very grateful. I was disappointed and sadness that my application not approved,  whereas my friends whom applied got approved even they have more than a hundreds thousands in their account and im having a pressure of paying my outstanding loan from HDB and monthly bill to settle, yet my application was turned down, really hopeful that social service officer Noriliza can help my case.",
