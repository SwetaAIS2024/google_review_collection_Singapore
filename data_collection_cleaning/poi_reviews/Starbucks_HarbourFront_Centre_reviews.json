Here you can buy different SB souvenirs, like the Singapore Starbucks mug, among others.\nThe service is good and the quality of the coffee is excellent, as always.\nThis is a good place to wait and have some good time while waiting for the ferry to board.",

So today, i reminded myself to taste my matcha before i left and it was sugaryyy. Is there no “no sugar” button in the order system? Yes, the ladies there made me a new one with no sugar immediately. But i dont wanna have to taste test my matcha every time i order from here.\nNever had issues like this at any other Starbucks.",

      "text": "ordered pick up while walking to the starbucks from the mrt, hoping for the drink to be ready when i reach. when i reached the cafe, which wasn't busy at the moment when i entered, app says my drink wasn't ready.. hence i went on to set up my laptop first. i did abit of work for like a good 5mins, and i saw the staff wasn't preparing any drinks, they were chit chatting. so i went to the pick up stand to see if my drink was ready. next thing i saw is my drink there at the pick up stand... my drink have definitely have been there for a while as the foam have been separated by the melted ice. picked it up anyways cus im thirsty. staff only click \"ready\" on my order when i have COLLECTED AND SEATED?! LIKE HELLO U GOT TIME TO CHIT CHAT BUT CANNOT JUST CLICK THE \"READY\" FOR ME TO KNOW???? -- starbucks please work on your staff\nanyways, i ordered my regular low fat hojicha with extra scroop, this was sweeter than what i usually have at other starbucks.. what in the LOW SOP here!! --  please educate your staff with your SOP PROPERLY\nnevertheless, i came here during the PH to study, surprisingly no crowd. the only plus point for my visit here today. but noisy staffss definitely made the experience worse. Its okay to chit chat during work but mind your volume. YOU HAVE CUSTOMERS!! BE PROFESSIONAL LADIES!!",
