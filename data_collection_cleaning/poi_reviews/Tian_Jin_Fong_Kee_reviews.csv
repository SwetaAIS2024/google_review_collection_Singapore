El Alv,4,"Ordered ""dough skin soup"", 面片汤and steamed dumplings.

Very unique dough skin soup! First time seeing this in Singapore. Cost $5. Thick generous egg soup. no meat inside, but the handmade dough is worth the try.

10 dumplings for $7. Acceptable also.

But minus one star for using disposable cutleries even for dine-in.

Recommended for people who dont mind :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107609901703594470041/reviews

Victor Ng,3,"Must try the dough skin soup. Very unique dish that tastes like Thai suki. The eggy soup broth is very smooth and comforting but the bits of hae bee(dried shrimp) at the bottom of the bowl is quite irritating.

The pan fried dumplings were disappointing. It tasted like they were baked instead of fried - so hard and dry.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115343125507441223772/reviews
