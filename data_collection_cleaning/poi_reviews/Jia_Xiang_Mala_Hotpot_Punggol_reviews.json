Fresh fish and good texture. Solid fuel to keep food warm. No top up for the soup but ample for a meal. Could not even finish the meal.  I would not said that the gravy is great but it's still great value for the price you pay. If you are looking for budget chongqing grilled fish, look no further. This is the place for you!",
