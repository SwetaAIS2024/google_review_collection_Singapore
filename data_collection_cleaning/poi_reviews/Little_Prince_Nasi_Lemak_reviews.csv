Jacqueline Yiew,1,"We visited the Ang Mo Kio branch of The Little Prince Nasi Lemak after watching the Instagram reviews. We ordered two plates of nasi lemakâ€”one sambal petai prawns set and one chicken drumstick set. While our order was being prepared, we requested to add brinjal and two portions of otak to the chicken drumstick set. The staff member responded rudely, insisting that we should have specified our requests from the start. He said that he was hesitant to add otak unless we confirmed it upfront, fearing that we might not want it later. Despite my clarification that we were happy to pay for the add-ons, he remained unhelpful and curt, implying that our request was an inconvenience.

This poor customer service has left a lasting negative impression. I will definitely not be returning.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111938994558765878779/reviews
Personal Opinion,1,"Ordered one nasi lemak and 5 chicken wings. Rice is moisture, no taste, fish cake hard like rock. Chicken wing only edible when hot, when cold... You try. Last of all, customer service is very rude. Won't go again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111228628102261029573/reviews
Ken hohoho,5,Great nasi lemak! Ordered for a Christmas party and food was super good. Sambal has a spicy kick to it and every fried item was freshly fried. Rice had strong coconut flavour which is what i love most. Highly recommended.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102472123606702205250/reviews
