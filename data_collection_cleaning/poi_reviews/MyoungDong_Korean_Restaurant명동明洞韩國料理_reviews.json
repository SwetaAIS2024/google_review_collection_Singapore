      "text": "If you‚Äôre craving authentic Korean flavors without the plane ticket, Myeong Dong restaurant is your answer. Drawn here by a friend‚Äôs glowing recommendation, I left utterly convinced‚Äîthis spot nails the balance of homely comfort and vibrant Seoul-style dining.\n\nThe seafood pancake (haemul pajeon) was a crispy, golden masterpiece, loaded with tender squid, shrimp, and scallions, paired with a tangy dipping sauce that cut through the richness perfectly. But the star was the Korean ginseng chicken soup (samgyetang): a steaming, fragrant clay pot of tender whole chicken stuffed with glutinous rice, swimming in a broth that whispered of earthy ginseng and subtle garlic. One sip transported me back to a cozy eatery in Seoul‚Äîthat level of authenticity. The pork skewers were juicy and charred just right, while the fresh oysters were plump and briny.\n\nService here is a highlight‚Äîwarm, attentive, and quick to offer suggestions or refill banchan (those addictive kimchi sides!). The staff‚Äôs genuine smiles and eagerness to share their favorites added a welcoming touch to the meal.\n\nAs for pricing? Expect reasonable rates that won‚Äôt shock your wallet.",

My wife couldn‚Äôt stop praising herself for spontaneously picking the place for dinner.",
