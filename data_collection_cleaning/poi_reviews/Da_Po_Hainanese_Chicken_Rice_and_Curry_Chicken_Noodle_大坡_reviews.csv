Kent Bay,4,"Supposed to give a better scoring for the service but there's seems to be much errors in my take away order.
Gizzards and eggs where not packed. And the curry chicken only had tau pok but no chicken in it.
Overall, the aunty is very friendly, the chicken is soft and juicy, rice is good and  provided soup, tomatoes and cucumbers on the side.
$30 (1 Chicken)
+ $5.50 (Curry) No chicken.
+$5 (Veg)
+$5  (egg & gizzards) missing.
+$5 (5x rice)
+ $1(boxes).",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112451355546834539735/reviews

Jasper Teo,5,"Tried Da Po at Golden Mile Food Complex previously and didn't expect them to open at Tanglin Halt Market near to my workplace. Food is still good and portions are huge for the large size. $8 for the large curry chicken rice, which comes with an additional soup. Definitely recommend if you're in the area, as the queue at Golden Mile is a long wait.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112581039499364926255/reviews
HAONAM LEE,1,"I have lived for 30+ years, this is the first time in my life eating such poor tasting chicken rice. The chicken lived its life in vain, and you guys wasted the efforts of the rice farmers. Very horrible tasting chicken rice",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115241620801707967932/reviews
