Loger Kenn,5,"A small but growing church, everyone seems to know each other. Always have great fellowship before and after each Sunday service which continues during lunch.

Sermons are refreshing, i always find new insights to the Scriptures.

Many avenues to serve and be useful to THE LORD üôåüèª

Joshua L. Lim,5,Wonderful fellowship with lots of friendly brothers and sisters in true Christian worship! Initially I thought that parking is inconvenient and I actually parked my car in another building. Later it was made known to me that the parking in the church premise is FOC every Sunday! Good food and fellowship after worship too!,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117135711957215000705/reviews
