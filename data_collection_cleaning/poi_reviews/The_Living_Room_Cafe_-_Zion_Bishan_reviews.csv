Jie Yi Lim,5,"Pleasantly surprised with the quality (and price!) of the food when we came with no expectations since this was the only pet friendly cafe (outdoors only) around the area. Had the cottage pie and yuzu coffee. Cottage pie was tasty, savoured up till the last bite and yuzu coffee was really well balanced with just enough acidity. Came with my husband and total for 2 mains and 2 drinks came up to only $42!!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117888752090692793195/reviews

JJ EatPlayTravel,5,"Food:
The cafe serves mostly western cuisine such as Large Big Breakfast, Honey Toast with Bacon, Chicken Truffle Grain bowl, etc. They also server local delights such as Beef Stew, Kimchi Luncheon Stew with Koka Noodles, Nyoya Chicken Curry Rice, etc. Note: the menu may change from time to time. üòÑ

My favorite:
Tom Yum Pasta with King Prawns: Spicy, sweet, sour, feisty and fiery that sum up this tantalizing fusion Thai-Italian Tom Yum Pasta with mouthwatering and fiery Giant King Prawns! üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç

Service:
The staff are super friendly, helpful and attentive and really reserved a 5 stars from me.

Atmosphere:
The caf√© is located inside Zion Bishan Church. The restaurant looks simple with friendly and cozy environment you want to do some work or read a book. Note that there are not many tables and you may need to call for checking there are seats available or the restaurant is closed for events.

Verdict:
It is a friendly neighborhood cafe set within Zion Bishan Church. They serve fairly good meals that made in their own kitchen. I usually dropped by to enjoy a cup of hot coffee and a warm meal. At the same time, enjoying my easy-peasy ‚Äúme‚Äù time to get away from hustle and bustle time for the week. Happy weekend ahead!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102452507461311808877/reviews
Su Xing,5,"This is my family‚Äôs favorite cafe. In my opinion, the Chicken pot pie is the best and I order it each time we visit, the soup is creamy and best to pair with garlic bread. Another must-try is the Mushroom Tom Yum pasta, which tastes authentic. Other things we usually order include: Flat White coffee, Tiramisu, and the Apple Crumble with ice cream. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Service is great without service charge. Highly recommend.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116849634223492472697/reviews
