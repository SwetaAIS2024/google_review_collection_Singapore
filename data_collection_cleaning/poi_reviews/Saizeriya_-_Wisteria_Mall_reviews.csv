emerald manoj,2,"Great Ambience ,instagram worthy interior , a brand name and a fancy menu ... but the coldest service ever !
We hit the place cause it was a new outlet in the neighbourhood and thought we 'll try something different , it was our Anniversary day and we shouldve known better !
After waiting for sometime we were directed to a table and that was it really ! We couldn't find anybody to take our orders even after requesting for a while ...
The seatings were really comfy and the interior designs were surely pleasant to eyes...
There was a staff later on who got our orders with the coldest face ever but prolly He had a long day ! We ordered wine with the food and the wine glasses were literally stumped on the table , wondering if it is a Sin to order wine ... Whatever ,when the food arrived it was another waiter who literally slapped the plates on the table and left !
The food was average but the presentation seemed pretty ... The portion size was decent as well ...
Definitely not going back to this place ONLY cause of the wonderfully pathetic service !",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116697614667332134047/reviews
Kimyuu Hanriiya,4,Very pleasant place ... Food is normal but still cheap and nice .The pepperoni pizza was quite thin and crispy but at a great price around 8 bucks and the aglio olio prawn was simply creamy and delicious with big prawns and even plain olio olio was fresh but the chilli part a bit plain they shld give us chilli pepper instead of tobacco...The drinks are self service and can take Ur own anytime .Overall good for family and students friends ...price was around 20 as I order 2 sets oglio and 1 pizza .Even service staff was patient and polite .,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103955145126436238763/reviews

Jie Min,1,"Really bad experience here. Ordered a Cheddar Beddar Sausage and a Garlic Focaccia. The sausage came inside icy and outside warm. We flagged out to the staff, and they just reheat the Sausage we bit into. Garlic focaccia is not toasted well and doesnt have the taste of garlic. Its warm inside the restaurant, we didnt feel any ventilation or aircon. Overall bad experience. Would advise people to head to other outlets instead.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103075401392928967789/reviews
