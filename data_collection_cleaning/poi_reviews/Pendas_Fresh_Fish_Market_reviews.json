      "text": "Enjoyed shopping at this fishermanâ€™s market. Very limited variety, depending on the catch of the day. Most stall holders speak only Malay and little English. Some of the fish were really fresh, still in rigor motis state. However, price was not very cheap. Can get cheaper or comparable price in some markets in Singapore. However, it was still enjoyable to wander around the rustic countryside. The drive to Pendas market was relaxing due to a very different landscape from Singapore. Was quite an experience driving through the wide expanse of highway roads and not seeing any high rise buildings, as well as navigating the narrow meandering countryside roads with oil palm trees lined on both sides. Will definitely visit again.",

As for the flower crabs, the price did not increase but the crabs were smaller in size.\n\nI hope it was seasonal issue that affected the price; need to confirm during future visit.",
