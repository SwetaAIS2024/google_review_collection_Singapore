Spare Republic,5,I was introduced by a friend to come here because they said the coffee and cakes are delicious. And she was right. The mochaccino I order was very well balanced and the lemon meringue tart complimented the coffee. And wow water is free!!!! The male barista gave me a good recommendation for coffee and cakes. I will definitely be back again!!!!,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117475338117602174967/reviews
