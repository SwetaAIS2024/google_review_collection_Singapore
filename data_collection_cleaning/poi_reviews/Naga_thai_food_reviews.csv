LULU EVOX,4,This dried curry chicken rice is a must to eat. Surprisingly good and strong taste yet not spicy. The Tom yum soup is good and creamy too. I ever tried their mango rice too. Sweet cold mango with warm rice and coconut milk top on it. Too bad. Today never order. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ scary heaty.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107012020161541736403/reviews

Jims Lim,5,"Food was nice . I only order kra pow as this is the usual food I like and can see the skill of the chef. Most basic thai food .  This place no pork so they use chicken . Chicken can be slightly more minced â€¦ Taste for me was just nice as I cannot eat too spicy â€¦ the chicken a lot.. the lemongrass drink was nice ! Try thatâ€¦
Order was easyâ€¦ food ready in 5 min â€¦ was good for me for everything .",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117819255145481491275/reviews
