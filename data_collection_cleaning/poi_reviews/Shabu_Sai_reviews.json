      "text": "Nice and great pricing Shabu Shabu restaurant in Changi City Point.\n\nThe soup base is very flavorful therefore umami will sure be level over 9000. Many varieties of food to choose from. $18.90 will not have beef. SO it's good news for those who do not consume beef.\nAdd $2.50 for additional drinks free flow. The soft serve also tastes great although it's only one flavour , it's a great productive machine. Like!\nThey clear our empty trays in a great frequent manner. Nice! Then food also comes fast. No complaints here. ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°",

You can also add-on free flow soft serve and drinks (non-alcoholic) for S$2.50.\n\nHad a good time and the wait staff were nice and  quick on their feet, refilling our broth every now and then.",

      "text": "Daily Japan style hot pot buffet.\n\nThis place has increased its prices a bit; weekday dinner is now $25.99++, with an additional $2.5 for water and ice cream. Overall, it's still reasonably priced.\n\nThe beef is fresh, thinly sliced, and just the right thickness, so you won't feel uncomfortable after eating. The yuzu soup base is relatively light, while sukiya tends to be a bit salty. This place doesn't offer as many varieties of dishes as the one in Simei; it doesn't have lobster-flavored fish balls. Of course, true buffet connoisseurs who come with a purpose likely won't waste stomach space on vegetables.\n\nOpting for regular beef is a wise choice because wagyu beef tends to be very fatty, and you might feel overwhelmed after just a few bites. Trying to eat enough wagyu to make it worth the price challenges the limits of human acceptance of fatty meat. However, regular beef also has its fair share of fat, which is why beef slices always look so appealing, and it's a secret profit formula for the restaurants.\n\nSome negative reviews mention poor service because they clean up and start closing early, creating a rushed atmosphere to encourage customers to finish quickly. Customers arriving late, for instance, eating around 9:30 pm, find that the self-service water dispenser has been removed, and they have to refill their glasses manually. I don't think this is a significant issue since the waitstaff are generally polite and frequently remind customers of the last order time. Besides, when eating at home, we often pour our own water, so don't let it create unnecessary stress. Just enjoy your meal.",
