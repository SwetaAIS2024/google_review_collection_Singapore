BHARATHI. S,4,"The nearest to our place, thus almost gone there everyday. The have wet market, fruits, vegetables, flowers, all other stuffs. But the clothing stores are seemed expensive, we got a belt here as we forgot to bring. And it was nothing but looks like a blunt rope but she got us nearly 20$ ðŸ˜¶ðŸ¤•. But there was a waffle place, and they just gave us the whole full circle of the waffle for just 1.50$. And it tasted superb too. And they also had different varieties of breads like nuts and berries bread, chocolate bread, blueberry bread, strawberry breads, pineapple breads, and so so... and everything was unique and tasted perfectly good. The nuts and Berry breads were mindblowing. Full of nuts and berries were I need to find the bread. The quality and quantity they keep up is really awesome. We go to the kfc and McD there. It was good and the Fair Price market inside this mall is super good. They have all goods and food items, chocolates at best prices.
