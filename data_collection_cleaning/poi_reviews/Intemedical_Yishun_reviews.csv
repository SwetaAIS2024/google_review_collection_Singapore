Naimi Adia,1,"i live across the street so this is the most convenient clinic i could go to for when i am unwell. i’ve had unpleasant experiences from the receptionist multiple times here. she wears glasses. i have also read the other reviews on your clinic and i think many others have encountered a similar experience with the same receptionist. i think when one feels unwell and walks into a clinic, we wouldn’t want to be attended by someone lacking of compassion, empathy, and basic customer service. i hope this is something you can look into. even your other receptionist with the tattoos is more professional and it shows that she takes pride in her role here. hope something can be done here. thank you.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110649143883364979342/reviews
Wendy Tan,5,"The clinic is newly opened, and the service was excellent. Dr. Damian and Nurse Estella were very polite. The doctor was thorough and patiently explained my daughter’s medical condition in detail. I also inquired about using Medisave for the influenza jab. While they were initially unsure if my husband’s medical condition qualified, Dr. Damian quickly checked and provided a clear answer. I truly appreciate their efficiency and dedication to patient care. Thank you!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107116487781593920279/reviews
Alicia Toh,5,"Dr Gee and the counter staff (Ms Estelle) not sure if I spell her name correctly are always very friendly attending to my son and my medical needs. Also when my son is sick during the doctor's visit, they are always very patient to my son as well when attending to him. Thank you for the wonderful service :)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104441640366267636074/reviews
Vincent Only,5,"Was attended by doctor Damien, thank you for making the visit a breeze and your jovial attitude is very much welcomed. It really helps to ease the patient mind when you don't make the whole visit into an interview. Lastly, thank you to the receptionist with the awesome tattoos. Your patience and welcome gestures made my day.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100686191549525302672/reviews
Theaya A/P Efrom,1,"My experience at the intemedical Yishun BLK 419 Avenue 11 #01-381 Singapore 760419 on May 14, 2025, was unpleasant. The receptionist was rude and unwelcoming, lacking basic customer service skills. It's important to treat all customers with respect, and she may not be suited for her role.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113826614501010422146/reviews
