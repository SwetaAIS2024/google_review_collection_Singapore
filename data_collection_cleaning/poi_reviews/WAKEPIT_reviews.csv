Elena Tan-M√ºller,5,"My partner and I have been wake-foiling & surfing for more than a year (twice a month) with Wake Pit.

They are very reliable, and both the coaches, Frankie & Ping, are nothing but patient. They guided us through the proper techniques and corrected us as and when needed.

We were entirely new to foiling and surfing when we started, but now we can confidently foil and surf without holding on to the rope.

I always look forward to my session with them, and I will let you in on a secret..... They have a super cute dog onboard with them (most of the time)! You know where to go if you are a dog-lover and want a great time on the water! :D",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100342693527622681513/reviews
Xavier Sioh,5,"Tried Wakepit via a friend's recommendation. Haven't looked back since! Personally, I'm still trying the gasp the improvements that I've made so far in a matter of a fornight!

Went for a 4 personal sessions, two hours each. Under the watchful eyes and immense guidance of Frankie and Ping they gave me tips and guided me through even run that I made, encouraged me with every fall that I made.

Frankie and Ping are champions in their various divisions. So how not to improve learning from two champs?

The boat is a super luxurious and comfy one that can fit 8 pax with plenty of space and a large canopy that covers almost the full length of the boat!

The entire experience justifies the price one has to pay! Its is very beginner friendly as well. Highly recommend!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115850771080840583807/reviews
Shanice Ang,5,"Really enjoyed our wakesurfing lesson! It was my first time trying it out, but the instructors were so patient and made lessons fun!
They also have a brand new boat which was so clean and big! To top it all off, Butter the dog followed us out for the lesson and he was such a well-behaved and good boy!!
Overall it was a great day out at sea :)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116875802214005213451/reviews
Desiree Low,5,"Always a splashing good time with Wakepit! I started wake surfing/boarding with Wakepit about a year ago and have never looked back :)

Frankie and Ping are super welcoming and are extremely educated in the sport. They‚Äôre never shy to spread the love for the sport and are always willing to give tips to improve your form. Their passion for the sport is contagious and I‚Äôm living for it! With them, I see myself improving every session rather than just simply having some fun in the water!

I find myself excited for the next session after every one and that‚Äôs testament to the work they put ü§òüèº Always always a joy to wakesurf with them ü§ç

Bonus points if you love dogs!! Thank you butter for being our constant lifeguard on duty!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101001356306021343939/reviews
Chan yeong yuan,5,"Love my experience with Wakepit as me and my friends onboard the journey on both wakeboarding and wake surfing. Our instructors(defending champions in their field) has been phenomenal in our journey in pinpointing where we could improve and have been patient with that. In addition , the journey wouldn‚Äôt be complete while having a great time on the boat with beers and their cute family member ‚Äú@buttertheseadog‚Äù",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111563068278480077529/reviews
