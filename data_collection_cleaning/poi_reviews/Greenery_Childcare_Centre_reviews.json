      "text": "my kids has had a great experience at Greenery with the caring and helpful teachers. My kids has been attending for over 5 year now, and I couldn't be happier with the care they received.\n\nGreenery is always make sure the centre clean and well-maintained, and I appreciate the emphasis they place on safety. The outdoor play area is spacious and equipped with age-appropriate toys and equipment. Although the centre is not air-con, but the good thing is the air flow is great and kids are not so prone to disease spreading in the air.\n\nMy kids has formed strong bonds with the teachers. Greenery also provide additional curriculum such as language and technology classes to allow children to be well-rounded.\n\nCommunication with the staff has been excellent. I appreciate the regular updates I receive about my kids day, including what they ate, how long they napped, and any notable milestones they reached. It gives me peace of mind knowing that they are in good hands.\n\nIn terms of flexibility, Greenery has been incredibly accommodating. They understand the challenges of modern parenting and work with families to find schedules that suit their needs.\n\nOverall, I wholeheartedly recommend Greenery to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment for their child. It's been a wonderful experience for our family, and I'm grateful for the positive impact it's had on my kids development.",

      "text": "Excellent School environment. Though is without Aircon, I find it a plus point for open air where kids will not fall sick that easily and kids get to sweat out. I like the arrangement with free time where different age group gets to interact with one another.\n\nExcellent Teachers & principal are very kind, friendly, patient and fun which makes children love going school. They are also attentive like food allergy, oral medication and skin medication.\n\nFun activities! Lots of activities where kids can explore their creativity. School is very active on the updates in terms of phone apps and face to face. Food is good and healthy.\n\nPersonally feel that my daughter enjoy the school activities and teachers. Highly recommended!",
