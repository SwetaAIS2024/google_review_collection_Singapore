Teachers can be more professional and not chase me umpteen times on what time I will arrive to pick up my child especially when I'm in the middle of work. If I had a choice, I would not be working and stay home with my kid. Obviously I work to make ends meet. That being said, they do try and they are pretty affordable and located next to MRT. Teaching standards can further improve, there is no spelling for K2 which is unheard of.",
