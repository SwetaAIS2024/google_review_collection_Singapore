A peaceful ride with stunning sights of Marina Bay and the city skyline.A perfect sunset ride—calm, romantic, and unforgettable. If you're visiting Singapore for the first time, the Flyer is a must. The views are completely next level. In some cute & short words it's like One ride, endless views. Loved every minute. I completely recommend Singapore Flyer, It's surrounding view, Technology, Landscaping, Infrastructure, Architecture & everything almost all the matter.",
