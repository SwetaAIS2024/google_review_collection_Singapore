There’s always a wide selection of both cooked and raw food - not to mention that desserts, condiments, and drinks are all included in the buffet price.\n\nThe service is great, and dining here has always been an enjoyable experience.\n\nI’d definitely come more often if it weren’t located in such a busy downtown area.

      "text": "There was a wide selection of both cooked and raw food. We ordered the collagen soup and chicken ginseng soup, both were flavourful, with the collagen soup being especially delicious. The meats, including pork collar, pork liver, pork belly, and sliced chicken, were fresh and of good quality. There were beef slices too but we did not try them. There was also a generous variety of vegetables to choose from, such as kai lan, spinach, cabbage, and mushrooms.\nFor drinks, there were three options: sour plum, blackcurrant, and fruit punch.\nWe enjoyed the sour plum drink the most.\nWe ordered the yam paste and peach gum ching teng for dessert. The yam paste was average, go for the peach gum dessert.\nAmong the cooked dishes, we particularly enjoyed the fried chicken wings, fried nian gao and the volcano spicy pork. A DIY sauce station added a nice personal touch to the meal.\nThe staff were attentive and efficient, regularly topping up the soup and clearing plates promptly. Overall, it was a great dining experience, and we’ll definitely be back for more!",

Even the ginseng herbal soup is bland.\n\nThe veg, like spinach is old and fibrous.\n\nNeed not fully enjoy the 90mins.\n\nLeft within an hour.\n\nSuggestion: improve ur condiments, soup base. And do not keep on promoting like and share. Back then I ate more than 20 times at centerpoint, intro others to eat there. If food is fresh and nice, there will be pple.\n\nService is good.",
