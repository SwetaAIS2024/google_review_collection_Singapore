Kary Yap,5,"Hidden gem tucked away on level 2 of Tampines Mart. Professional nail artists that are able to nicely replicate nail art designs from XHS, Instagram references. Good products that are not harmful to nails, huge variety of polish colours. Good Quality of manicures/pedicures, in my 8years here, ever once had a manicure last close to 8 weeks before chipping. Otherwise, 3-4weeks not a problem. Responsible artists, ever had a case where the nail design chipped in 2days, was able to get it redone at no extra cost.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112197328222722755237/reviews

chloe,5,Had a really good manicure session with Mei San! She took inspiration from the photo I gave her really well and did the nail art in her own way and it looks really good! She suggested colors for me to use to match the pictures as well. Whole session was really smooth and comfortable! The nail technicians are all very welcoming and patient when I explain what I want for my nails. Thank you so much! :),4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115383968663665378760/reviews
