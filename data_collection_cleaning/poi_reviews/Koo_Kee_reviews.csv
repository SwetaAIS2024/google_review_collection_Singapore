YC L,1,"Went to do a takeaway today.. When we got home, we realised they gave 2 packets of thick yellow noodles instead of the usual thin yellow noodles. Out of the 3 packets that we ordered, only 1 of them are right. We paid money for these and felt like we were cheated",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111368102227583976395/reviews
Loh Soon Shan,5,"Finally they are here in Yew Tee Point, still the best Yong Tau Foo of all. They have a oft and flavourful fillings. One of our favourite is their Ginseng Soup, strong herbal taste and refreshing as well. You should really check them out if you haven’t.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114194136783291087444/reviews
Paul Young,4,"Friendly service, good range of food. I have no10 - Yong Tau Foo with Chee Cheong Fun. Added ngo heong. And also the rice dish. The laksa dish was ok. Gravy could be more tasty and a little watery. Ngo heong if heated up better. Taste ok. Their rice dish is actually quite good. Tasty meat, rice was well done.
I don't really like the Thai ice tea. Colour looks a little off and taste too. Not as authentic but ok lah. This is not a Thai stall:)
Overall, a 4 star experience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109729405213634414664/reviews
YJ,3,"Ordered the promo herbal chicken set at 7.08pm. At 7.21, 13 mins later they tell me that it needs to be steamed for 10 mins and ask me if it’s okay. (Like, I already ordered and paid and waited, what’s the alternative?)

Think they should have prioritised and started steaming early if they know it’s going to take more time

Edit: at 740 it still wasn’t ready (they said 4 more min but I’m not sure I trust that estimate) and I asked for a refund.

They were apologetic but i think they should review their work processes",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105207524053898097101/reviews
Angel OY,3,"I have seen Koo Kee growing from 1 small stall in Koufu to 2 unit eateries at the entrance of Yew Tee Point. But I am not fancy of it bcos it is simply Yong toufu and bland. It is very suitable for ppl going after simple, bland taste, and healthier choices.
Yes,the Yong toufu tastes fresh and not frozen type.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104291863399942539341/reviews
