Brandon Yeo,5,"Visited on 8 Jan 1030pm. It's one of the few that are open at this hour but don't be mistaken. The guys here put their best foot forward to ensure that my car was properly washed and vacuumed and tyres shined. At RM20, it's really a job well done! It's a nice find and I hope that their business will continue for a long time and expand.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105654128362934703471/reviews
Jamie Goh,5,"Great service and good price. 25rm/for a sedan.

Corrected. It's 20rm for a sedan. Car mat cleaning is very clean, not a single speck of dirt/leaf/soil etc. Can say it's the best carwash service in JB after trying out so many places.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114401884438958149122/reviews
Abdul Samad,5,"Thoroughly cleans every nook and cranny of the exterior with ample manpower to wash my car. Chose the basic wash option, priced at RM20.

sha banu,1,The marketing of this shop seems good so I paid visit after setting appointment. Went there for the worker to say I cant do normal wash and I must add on wax. I said no as my car is already coated with wax. Then they proceed to say the carwash centre just open and I need to wait. I said I set appt at 11am and now its already 11.20am. Then the worker asked to check my whatsapp to verify the appt time then only proceed to ask one worker to start washing my car while these 2 workers have their early lunch and smoking right beside the waiting area. The car is NOT clean. They did terrible job in terms of hospitality and service. Money wasted. Maybe they are only nice to people taking their expensive package. Will never come back again. And I do not recommend this shop. Never been so disappointed. But the 2 women taking care of counter are friendly.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101684081626716131048/reviews
