      "text": "Was invited here as a guest to enjoy the Easter brunch buffet - enjoyed the devilled mayo egg cold dishes. A little turned off by the flies flying around the beautifully presented food, and some landed on the vegetables in the salad section.\n\nThe roast chicken was surprisingly nice, not dry, and I enjoyed the roast beef. Only wish that the chef could be more generous with each serving of beef, when I asked for more she gave only one piece as if i'm asking too much. But i understand, there probably have been many cases of food wastage.\n\nPecan crusted salmon was nicely cooked, seasoning was a little bland for my liking and the sour cream sauce was a little bland.\n\nAtmosphere was lively and loud due to the festivities, there were children running around playing games and free balloon sculpting.\n\nDesserts were very nicely arranged and many were Easter themed, enjoyed the chocolate soil eggs, and bunnies atop the cakes. :)\n\nOverall a rather enjoyable time. Waiters and waitresses were very busy, but plates were still cleared when they had the time.",

      "text": "Came to check out the Miyazawa A5 Wagyu special for the month. The Miyazawa Wagyu beef fried rice was outstanding. The short grain rice took on bits of char after we mixed in the sauce and egg, and left in the hot plate for abit. Wok-hei-ious!\nThe braised Miyazawa beef was resoundingly the highlight! The meat was tender with just the right amount of grilled smokey surface. And the pepper sauce complemented it very well. We shared a cendol to finish off this wonderful meal. OMG this cendol brought back memory of Penang with the pandan cendol that‚Äôs kueh-like soft. Together with Gula Melaka in the coconut milk and fine shaved ice, it was the best cendol I had in Singapore.\nWe‚Äôll be back üòÅ",

      "text": "My family has been eating here (and at the sister outdoor Lookout cafe with the same kitchen) for many many years, and we've seen the food quality go up and down and back again.\n\nIn the last couple of years, they've tried to improve the menu and bring in specials, some of which work better than others. In this case, they're having a Japanese Miyazaki beef special and the offerings look good so we decide to try.\n\nI was there with my wife and mom around 11:15am. Not crowded at that time even on Saturday, and we had out pick of tables. We got one next to the glass walls overlooking the ponds, so quite relaxing view.\n\nFoodwise, we were there for the beef so we had the Slow Roast Crusted Miyazawa Wagyu Brisket, the Miyazawa Wagyu Hamburg (medium rare) and the Miyazawa Wagyu Beef Fried Rice, with an Energizer salad to start and a chendol (shared three ways) to finish.\n\nThe beef fried rice came first. See the picture (and video) for how it's served on a hot plate that you add a sauce and mix. If you leave it for a while, the hot plate gives everything a nice char. They use the medium grain rice so has a beautiful crust and tastes amazing. The beef is a bit lost in the sauce but likely the fat from the beef contributes to the overall taste.\n\nThe Energizer salad has lots of spinach leaves, blueberries, other veges, quinoa and root vegetables and comes with a purple dressing that is very thick. This is obviously on the healthy side of things and it tasted great. Could do with a bit of lemon juice and olive oil (personal taste) to balance the spinach but we asked for more dressing and it was okay.\n\nThe Hamburg was a disappointment. It's layered starting with mash potato, then a very strong tasting portobello (overwhelmed all the other tastes), then the beef burger (seems to be pure beef with no fillers or anything to hold it together) and topped with a deep fried cheese ball. Tastes didn't blend together and I think we should have asked for the beef to be well done.\n\nThe Brisket on the other hand was excellent! Lots of fat in layers and the slow braise brings out the flavours. It's accompanied by potatoes and a sauce but the beef is amazing just eaten by itself.\n\nLastly we just had space to share one chendol between the three of us. Good gula melaka, lots of coconut milk and the chendol tasted fresh and home made; soft with pandan flavours rather than what you get from hawker centres. As good as any chendol you'll get in M'sia.\n\nWe'll definitely try and come back before the beef specials are over. Try a few more dishes, maybe round 2 on the Brisket but definitely avoid the Hamburg again!",

      "text": "Food here is good. Great variety between local and western fare. Local food is hawker fare, and is authentic enough, while being much healthier (for E.g. the fried carrot cake is not oily and not salty). I love the ambience too. You're nestled in greenery surrounded by trees, and it's definitely very away from the hustle and bustle of the city.",
