Cheryl Tan,1,Owner of the store is very rude and snobbish. Never buy stuff from this shop.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110798938487693503801/reviews
Aidan the Legend,4,"A childhood comfort spot for me. You want a fidget cube? Die in a die? Bouncy balls? Top trump cards? Lego? Come to this spot. Matter of fact, you look around close enough, you can find some older Lego sets you won't find in the main stores no more...",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100520855394670867060/reviews
Zihui Lai,5,"Used to frequent this shop at Thomson Plaza but since they closed their unit there - it has been a challenge to find a shop like theirs!

Huge collection of toys that is different from Toy R Us? They have toys and play things that are closer to heart (maybe toys characters that parents know more of) unlike commercialised toys on adverts. They also sell newer trendier toys like the new concept of blind boxes “Gachapon”.

One thing awesome is that they have board games for younger ages i.e. before 7,8 years old; between 5-7 years old. Budding age to introduce board games before primary one!
Such better traditional board games are harder to source, the newer ones in malls are great too - but just different.

Massive lego collection as well :) even dated collectible ones if you’re big fan of building!

Many other knick knacks as well or on-the-go games; which would probably be a better option than Roblox and Minecraft :”) to an extent.

Definitely a go-to if you’re near that area!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105537224547669124113/reviews
Mei Zee Tan,1,"PLEASE AVOID. UNPLEASANT AND DISHONEST. We bought two fidget spinners from toy station for $30 each. The sales assistant had said that the $9 ones were out of stock. Within a day a part of the spinner came off n it was unusable. I brought It back and The Indian owner refuses to take responsibility for it. He says that he tells people that it is fragile (?? It's for kids!) n it's non refundable, both of which the sales person did NOT tell me or else I would have looked for a cheaper model. His exact words ""even if you had walked out and it it got broken in 5 minutes I can't do anything. Much less in one day"". Very unpleasant. Avoid.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113092260508000902540/reviews
Mark Anthony Canios,5,"I was impressed by the collection of toys. I saw that he had 4M toys which were very educational. I wanted to go back again but was unable to, which is why I contacted him via phone. He was flexible enough for me to purchase via PayNow and for me to arrange my own delivery. Overall good customer experience. I will go back for more :)",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115195685445618746698/reviews
