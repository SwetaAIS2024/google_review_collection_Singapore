(nov 5) The cashier staff don’t even bother to ask me about anything. He just scanned and tapped them. And put them in a bag. Like literally no words.\n\nPlease don’t work in retail and customer service. If you are not interested in it. Thank You.",

Though this branch is much smaller than the outlet at Nee Ann City and MBS, there is a still a decent collection here.\nThe bearbricks are sold at a premium price.",
