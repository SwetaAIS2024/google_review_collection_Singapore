Kevin Lee,4,"Water Park deep in the Suburbs. SIMPLE features but pure paradise for young children. After water fun, McDonald's for your young children at the mall next door.

Yiping Chen,1,"place is closed with no sign indication on how long and why. only pad lock. yet the whole water park is running and water flowing.

edit: they only put up the sign at the other gate where people don't actually walk to. and apparently it's been closed since 7.7.24 , it is 21.9.24 , yet not open. someone sleeping at their job.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118233221962699158878/reviews
Azhar Kamar,5,A decent neighbourhood water park with just enough play areas and water sprays. It’s not as fun as the bigger ones but fun enough for a free waterpark. There are two shower areas. Ample parking at buangkok mall nearby. When we came it was empty and the water wasnt on. i think there are sensors to save water. So you gotta manually switch it on. Overall we had a fun time!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114278465459509817931/reviews
