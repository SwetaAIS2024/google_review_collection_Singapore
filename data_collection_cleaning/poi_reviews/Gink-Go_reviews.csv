Soh,4,Nice small place for a meal when you are trekking at MacRitchie.  They serve healthy food and are mindful of the ingredients they use.   I had the potato salad and curry rice with chicken.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112618833143204824221/reviews
Thomas Timlen,5,"We finally made it to Gink-Go after some early morning trail running at  MacRitchie Reservoir. Opening at 7.30am this cozy little cafe serves up nice kopi and for vegans the cup of humus with carrot and cucumber sticks is a good treat. We also got the Japanese curry with veggies and rice and that was delicious. Next time we will try some of the pasta dishes.

There is a small air-conditioned room that can accommodate about ten people, if that is full there are many nearby benches etc. to sit and enjoy the food.

Service is very good and friendly",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102162456131009361077/reviews
Lena Gringmuth,5,"We had lunch here after a round of trekking and we're absolutely excited about the taste and quality of the food. We had the curry, banana muffin and the brownie and all of it was delicious! I like how they say they only use olive oil and no added sugar - great little place, definitely recommend for a little food break.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116705888547032301830/reviews
ng wen yi,5,"Had the flavourful chazuke with salmon and the hummus with carrot and cucumber sticks, topped off with black coffee. For those who like the unadulterated life, the mild flavours pair really well with nature's beauty.

The intentionality and care taken to formulate the menu and compose the ingredients is evident.

Thanks for looking after your customers",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103131539717778048991/reviews
