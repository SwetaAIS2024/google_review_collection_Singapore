Forest BK,5,"ðŸŒ¿An idyllic walkway running parallel to Haig Road. It connects Dunman Road to East Coast Road, passing through some road lanes.
ðŸŒ¿On both sides of the walkway are mostly private residences.
ðŸŒ¿Several fitness corners and children play areas are dotted along the walkway.
ðŸŒ¿There are lots of plants and trees along the clean walkway making the walk a pleasant one.
ðŸŒ¿Should it rains unexpectedly, you could take cover at one of the several shelters located at the walkway.
ðŸŒ¿Nice walkway without Road traffic.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews

Kristian Engelstad Kvalem,3,"It's a walkway. It's a way, and you can walk on it. Does it's job without any fuzz. As a bonus it also has plants. They're not in the way, so if you don't like plants, you've got nothing to complain about. Would I take a detour to get there? Not really. Would I walk it if it was the shortest route from where I am to where I'm going? Definitely! Deserves every one of the three stars. Especially the first two.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109721013012323531566/reviews
Sandeep Bharat,4,"Love the street with the open gym, nice place to see people walking, jogging, doing cycling etc various activities.

It's one for the people who just want to be bit away from traffic and all. Not quite big but good for people around, who want to go to park, market, shopping complex and around.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100826729555331959599/reviews
