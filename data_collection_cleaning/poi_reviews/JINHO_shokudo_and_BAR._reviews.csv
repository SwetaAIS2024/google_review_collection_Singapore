CHEN WEI LEE,4,"Decent japanese food with reasonable pricing. The pork jowl was very soft and tender and flavorful.
The aburi salmon roll was tasty as well.
Fresh ingredients used
However, the place tends to be very noisy",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100549154511103806901/reviews
Samuel Ho,5,"My favourite place to have dinner at One North. Amazing food, reasonable prices, great ambience.

Every dish I've tried so far is very tasty. Their Nabemono is a must, and their garlic rice is absolutely phenomenal!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114500436081927422788/reviews
Isabella Cordelia Chua Yong Yi,5,"Absolutely delicious food at really affordable prices :) I love that the service staff are so attentive.

The soups and cold tea are refillable. Tried their garlic fried rice with chicken cutlet, pork shabu shabu, beef shabu shabu & their spicy iberico pork jowl inaniwa udon (dry)! (We requested non-spicy) Portion sizes are good. Every single dish was tender, tasty, and memorable! üòã

Highly recommend this place! Would love to gatekeep, but I want them to be successful in their business so I can enjoy it for many more years to come ;)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100852002648804062808/reviews
ÊòØÊó†Âêç,5,"Very well located at one north area and the mrt. Busy during work hours like lunch.

Set lunches is reasonable priced.

The jap rice is not the best as compared to some others,  but ok!
The sashimi I had was really good.  Like it!

The tonkatsu (pork) and the chicken katsu, are dry. It seems a little over deep fried.  Recommend the chef to not over cook the katsu.

The chawamushi (steam eggs) is very good.  Yummy.

Otherwise,  this place is decent and presentable for your meals.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105456352515293598037/reviews
Colette Tan,4,"The food is good and value for money.

First visit: Two bottles of sake, one sushi roll, tsukene, sting ray fin, vegetable stir fry with salmon and grilled squid came up to about $144 (after tax and service charge). I liked the tsukene and sushi roll.

Edit: after two further visits I'd recommend the grilled fish collar and pork skewers instead. (The menu was changed and the tsukene was no longer as good.) avoid the gyoza.

The sake is good. Not crowded on a Friday night. Service is good. Music is a bit too loud.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112297245669411174670/reviews
