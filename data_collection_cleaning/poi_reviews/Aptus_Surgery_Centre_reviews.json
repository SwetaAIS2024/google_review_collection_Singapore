      "text": "I recently had the pleasure of undergoing surgery for my detached meniscus at Aptus Day Surgery, as most hospital could not accommodate an early slot for my injury to be fixed.\nI cannot express how grateful I am for the exceptional care I received. From the moment I arrived, I was met with compassion and understanding, staff which greatly eased my pre-op anxiety.\n\nThe pre-operative care was immaculate. Nurse Esther took her time to attend to all of my needs, answering my questions and ensuring I felt comfortable every step of the way right up to anaesthesia.\nHer patience and kindness made a world of difference.\n\nPost-operatively, the entire team was dedicated to ensuring that I was well enough to be discharged even though I was throwing up quite a bit. Once I was well enough I had a session of physio at the day surgery so that I was braced for slow walking again.\n\nThey went above and beyond, even wheeling me to the taxi stand to ensure I got home safely.\n\nOverall, Aptus Day Surgery is a five-star facility. I am immensely grateful for the care I received and would highly recommend it to anyone in need of surgery. Thank you, Aptus, for making my experience so pleasant!",

The staff are amazing, the nurses are so kind and caring. The facilities are great. Very clean. If I never need digital attention again this will be where I will coming.",

They did not give me any pain killers!! and I donâ€™t have one at home ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜¥. Staying awake with a lot of pain is a bit traumatic. Waiting for them to wake up and give me pain killer (if they will).\n\nDisappointed with them for not thinking about post-surgery effect.\n\nPlease consider this carefully!",
