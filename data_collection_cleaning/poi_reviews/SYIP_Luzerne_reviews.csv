M.X Ong,5,"The cafe is located within 5mins walking distance from Bendemeer and Boon Keng MRT stations. This outlet is really spacious and has good vibes. There was a slight queue on the weekend I went, so would recommend making a reservation if possible.

The Banana Pudding Matcha Latte was a March special and it did not disappoint. It was really good and would definitely go back again if it was permanent on their menu. Their drinks are the highlight for sure. The food was decent but the sauce for the breakfast tart was a tad too salty. The fried mushrooms was our favourite dish.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102769027769430349257/reviews
Wenya Lee,5,Service and food selections are great! The fried mushroom (sides) is something special i never tried before. Truffle fries were a hit with both adults and kids! Beef bowl can definitely be improved.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107248063720232052298/reviews
Lionel Ong,5,"At SYIP Cafe, I had the most most decadent Kaya butter French toast I’ve ever had. It not only looked fancy but it was sooo good too!

A very creative take on our local breakfast with really good butter, their home made kaya on a softly fluffy thick toast soaked in egg.

100% not something I’d do often. Very pricy! Haha

But this surely one goes into my books of when I want to bring a friend from overseas for something fancy to try.

Nice atmosphere too!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104952089142313918426/reviews
Min Hui Lim,3,"I am a fan of their Owen outlet so I thought why not try their Luzerne outlet since they have different menus? But their quality of food here is quite disappointing.

Apart from agreeing with other reviews that the rosti is too small, their vongole pasta is the most disappointing. When it first came, it has some weird smell, presumably from the wine because after some time it has dissipated but still didn’t help with the taste. The clams are still sandy, which some might say that it’s tough to clean clams but for the price paid and the quality I get, this is not up to standard. The pasta is also not al dante, quality far from their other pastas I ate at Owen

The only redeeming grace is their coffee, which I also love in their Owen outlet.

TLDR: come here for the drinks, but maybe skip the food, or at least the food we ordered",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113749500894354859785/reviews
Jonathan Koh,5,"This outlet is definitely more spacious than the farrer park outlet. The queue was also much quicker. Would recommend making a reservation ahead of time if possible.

The peanut butter latte was very creamy and satisfying. I was blown away by the kaya toast. The generous kaya spread combined with the chunks of butter was a divine combination on the brioche toast. Even the eggs were well seasoned. The octopus had a nice charred taste along with a wonderful chewy texture. The matcha tiramisu had a nice matcha taste that was not overpowering and also did not have the bitter aftertaste of a regular tiramisu.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103720618767845132407/reviews
