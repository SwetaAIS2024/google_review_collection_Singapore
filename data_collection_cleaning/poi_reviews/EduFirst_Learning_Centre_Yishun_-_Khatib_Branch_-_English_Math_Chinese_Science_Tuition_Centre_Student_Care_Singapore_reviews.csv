Nurul A'ien,5,"My son enjoys going to EduFirst since primary 1. He made new friends, able to socialize beyond school. Went for excursions during school holidays besides the activities held.

The teachers are open to two way communications which helped my son developed better skills and attitude. There's always a prompt reply from them when I have any enquires and things are clarified within the day itself. Should they noticed any issues my son is facing, they also promptly and timely inform us, which helps situations from escalating.

Would send my other sons over to EduFirst too once they enter primary school. And even if they are old enough to go about on their own, shall continue with EduFirst for tuition.

My son's studies have improved a lot. Homework is also cleared on the day itself, it helps for parents who are shift workers like us.

A special shout-out, being heavily pregnant lately and having difficulties walking to the centre which is located in the basement, the teacher was kind enough to accompany my son up to entrance of mall where I've just reached. It reassures with the way they ensure the students are kept safe. =)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117084013964007733629/reviews
