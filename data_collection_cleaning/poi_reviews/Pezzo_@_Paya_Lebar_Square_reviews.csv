mushroom soup,3,"Went at about 8:20am for their advertised breakfast sets but only 2 items off the bfast menu were available hahaha so I got the chicken mayo rolls. On the brightside, they were nice and hot. Service was alright, staff were busy getting started. Overall quite average but not bad for the price ($4.50 for 2 rolls and a drink).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103763145958425916548/reviews
Elfi,2,"I'm a fan of Pezzo pizza and their drumsticks; they're usually my go-to for a quick meal. On April 2nd at 7:30 pm, I found myself with a strong craving for their offerings. Unfortunately, I was unable to make a purchase due to the staff taking an Iftar break for an hour. While I fully respect the observance of religious practices, this break coincides with dinner's peak hours, leaving customers, myself included, longing for the food that's just out of reach, despite being visibly ready and the staff present but not available for service. Could there be a possibility to consider scheduling an additional staff member during these times to accommodate the one-hour Iftar break? This adjustment could help ensure that customers' needs are met without compromising the staff's observance of their religious practices.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108935994894401934490/reviews

William Sim,2,The attitude of the senior staff (seem like the supervisor) is sooooo bad. The company seriously need to look at the training of their staff. Now I am not surprise to see the average review of this company is only 3.3 and below. The supervisor did not bother the help or train the staff. Her attitude is like we owe her a millions. We collected the pizza on 11 Jun at 535pm and hope the manager/senior management could check the roster and identify this staff.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105313697336491264293/reviews
