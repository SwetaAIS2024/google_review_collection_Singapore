Wei Yng Poon,5,"I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the fantastic event held at the Chinese Swimming Club, Lattice Suite. A special shout-out goes to Edmund Lee and Andy Lam, whose outstanding assistance made the event a success. From the setup to accommodating special requests and providing excellent banquet support on the day itself, their hospitality was truly exceptional. The service was fast, efficient, and they went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. The food was delicious, with generous portions and a wide range of options to choose from. I highly recommend their services and look forward to working with them again!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107352799616553023506/reviews
Edward Shee,5,"Perfect hangout place for kids and adults to brunch there, tried their buffet there with the kids, there's something for everyone to eat! And not forgetting the swim there, big and small pool available, adults can also book the badminton court there for a game or two and bowling available. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed our half a day there at CSC üëçüèª",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112644020337194704576/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,"Have only been here as a guest a couple of times but it is such a lovely experience each time. The Christmas tree and decor was beautiful, something our kid especially love. The ballroom was wonderful but I understand it is about to go through renovation. Ample parking lots available here always a huge plus.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Porter KHOR,2,"Cafe looks nice but food is expensive.  Surprised that a members club charges premium prices for sub par food.

200g Ribeye steak $33 had too much gristle.  Unchewable bits in every bite.  Struggled to finish.  Jaw marathon through 200g.

Extremely crowded.  Busier than public  community centres.  Couldn't get a parking spot.  Had to queue for table.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115681434361834317527/reviews
