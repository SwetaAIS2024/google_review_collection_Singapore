Di Di,4,"I ate the century egg lean pork porridge two years back and bought it for my colleague. Both agreed that it is full of ingredients and. It is worth the amount paying for. Nonetheless, the recent visit was disappointing. I am not sure if it was because I did not buy the porridge for breakfast, and had it for lunch, or because of inflation.

I could only find shreds of meat, instead of the lean meat. There were not a lot of century eggs too, to the point that it was almost negligible. Adding an egg would cost $1. Nonetheless, the porridge does really taste great.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
