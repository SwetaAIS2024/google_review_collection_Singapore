      "text": "I‚Äôve visited Boon Tong Kee many times over many years, and it remains a dependable choice for chicken rice. The rice is consistently fragrant and flavourful, and the chicken and other side dishes are decent and reliable. The chili and ginger sauces are a bit too salty for my taste, sometimes overpowering the more subtle flavours. Still, it‚Äôs a place I return to regularly‚Äîespecially when I have friends visiting from overseas, as it offers a solid introduction to local favourites.",
