      "text": "Sound was great! Screen is damaged in 2 spots right in the center of the screen so once you see those dark spots you canâ€™t unsee them. Personally I found that to be really distracting. Felt like 17 degrees so wear more than just a tshirt. Compared to other IMAX theaters I found the resolution to be lacking. From row C I could see the individual pixels. Subtitles were quite pixelated. Seems like this IMAX is on the technical stand of 2010.",
