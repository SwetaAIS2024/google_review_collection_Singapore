Hrmgr,4,"Found this Thai restaurant that serves Mukratha (Hot plate BBQ) and Chim Chum (Thai Claypot). Ordered Chim Chum and was quite okay from the various Thai food I had. It would have been more authentic if they could add Thai basil, culantro and morning glory to the fresh veg. The meats should be cut thoroughly instead of a long string. The Thai condiment (Nam Chim) is good. They can do better by seasoning the meats and adding some flour to make them smooth when cooked.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews
jayden,5,"Awesome mookata from food to sauce to service of the staff and owners!
Meat is fresh and well marinated, they even removed the prawns head which makes it easier to eat and cook without ""tentacle/antenna"" that always gets stuck with other items on the grill or soup. The portion is reasonable for the price which definitely enough for 2 pax or even 3 if your not that hungry, the sauce is also nice.
What I felt satisfied in the dining experience was that initially the food was cooked very slowly maybe due to the fan or wind blowing thus making the grill not that hot and the soup not that boiling, however we didn't even complain initially or make any noise however the owner which was sitting nearby Infront of her stall might have notice it that we had some difficulty cooking the food even without us saying, she came over with some kind of ""grill shield placement""(have no idea how to call it) and ask the staff over to take out the grill so she could place and fix it nicely to block the wind and make the wire stronger which amazingly after 2-3 the grill instantly was piping hot with the usual mookata smoke and the soup also boiling correctly. This small gesture which it was also an eye opener for us even though we had eaten mookata so many times, we didn't know of such a ""device shield"" that can block off the wind as so many times at other restaurants or shops we would just be complaining about the slowly grilling of the food and literally just wait or even if we had told the staff, the staff would just tell us can't be helped due to wind.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
Josh Y,5,"Wow! Authentic Thai Herbal Hotpot (Chim Chum / Jim Jum) available at this coffeeshop.. Delicioussss, generous servings of fresh meat prawns, chicken, pork & greens, chilli sauce is top notch (top it to your soup for additional layer of flavour).

Enjoy dining here as though you’re in Thailand, good vibes and great beer pairing. You can also try their Mookata and other thai dishes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110031330851780405682/reviews
