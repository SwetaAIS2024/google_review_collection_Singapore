Y S,4,"Free and clean public water park for children. Quite well maintained although some of the water features no longer working like it was (like the rotating fountains).

The thing is that it got very very crowded during May Day public holiday. There is also no shower to rinse off in the changing room (toilet). The changing area is pretty small and gets crowded.

One last thing, not related to the park but rather the children behavior. Parents/caregiver please don‚Äôt scroll your phones when you are there. Watch out and educate your children especially when they are playing with water jets (see the photo). They might be standing directly on top of it with the water jet pointed to a certain part of their body too long after discovering ‚Äúnew sensation‚Äù they should have not. I noticed there are many like this which I think is inappropriate, but the children are too innocent to know that.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114810510179567579369/reviews
Dhananjay Garg,5,"We recently visited the Children's Garden at Gardens by the Bay, and it was such a memorable experience for our little family. My wife and I took our 2-year-old, and while we had planned to explore all the different play zones, it quickly became clear that the Water Play Area was the absolute star of the show for our toddler!

The water jets, fountains, and fish sculptures were a total hit, and the interactive water effects kept my son laughing and splashing for hours. The area for toddlers (1‚Äì5 years old) was especially delightful, with stepping springs and mini water tunnels designed perfectly for little ones. It was a joy to see him so engaged and happy in the cool water under the Singapore sun.

We skipped the dry sand areas like the Rainforest Tree Houses and the Adventure Trail this time since my son was completely captivated by the water works. That being said, the lush greenery around the garden made the whole experience feel relaxing and refreshing for us as parents.

This is one of the best free outdoor play spaces we‚Äôve been to in Singapore, and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough for families with kids. We‚Äôll definitely be back for another day of fun‚Äîand maybe next time, we‚Äôll convince our little water enthusiast to check out the dry zones too! üòä",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105192542383225533490/reviews
