      "text": "With link to/fro Novena MRT Station and sited on L2 of Sq 2 near escalators, this newly opened Killiney is in a rather optimal location in terms of accessibility, visibility and foot traffic. This space is bright, of good size providing a comfy spot for diners to enjoy familiar staples, a great cuppa and relaxation (outdoor seating available too). Also refreshing to see new food offerings (eg Chinese Dumplings and Grilled Salmon with Rice) added into its menu. Staff are courteous and efficient.\nNo prob getting a table of choice on Sunday morning. The following items are sufficient for sharing among 3 pax:\n- Chinese Dumplings (8 pcs)\n- Fried Bee Hoon w Egg, Luncheon Meat & Fish Cake\n- Luncheon Meat, Cheese & Egg Sandwich\n- Teh\n- Yuan Yang\n- Kopi O\nAll good except the overcooked eggs, and less than flavorful fish cake which are not to our liking. Will come back to try other food next time though.",

The service is good, the food serving is generous and delicious, especially the mee siam...one of my favorites. The coffee and ying yang are serve hot too. Definitely worth to try! Toast with kaya and chwee kueh are some great match with kopi..",
