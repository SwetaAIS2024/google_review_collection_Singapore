RGSEVEN,1,"I am not sure about other facilities but the squash courts seriously need some attention.  The courts are dirty with flakes of wall paint especially court # 4. The fans look like they have never been cleaned before for they are caked with dirt.  To add on, I noticed the presence of cobwebs on the lighting in the bathroom. Seriously, such lack of care is not justified.

Frankly, I do not ask much from a public facility but  the management in charge should at least ensure that the premises are clean enough for people to workout.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106478213048243032732/reviews
