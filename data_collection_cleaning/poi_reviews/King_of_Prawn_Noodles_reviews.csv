Savan,4,"I‚Äôve had prawn noodles here more than once already.
We ordered the Pork Rib Prawn Noodles (soup) and the Pig Stomach Noodles (dry).

The prawn noodle soup base is very fresh and sweet, but the pork ribs seemed to have been boiled for too long and had lost their flavor, so I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend ordering the pork ribs.
The dry pig stomach noodles were pretty good too, and it came with a small bowl of prawn soup.

Hubby loves the prawn noodles here, and it‚Äôs very close to home. For this price and this level of quality, it‚Äôs pretty reasonable.

Located inside a mall, so it‚Äôs air-conditioned and more comfortable to sit. The staff‚Äôs attitude was average.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115757903290306503916/reviews
"Yong Hui, Ronny Tan",4,"+ Food taste for prawn noodles and sides was ok.

- Food portion was small. The $6.60 bowl has only 1.5 prawns, sliced into 3 half-pieces.

= The Set meal is not a bad deal. Basically pay $2.50 more for a side and drink. The drinks were very watery and full of ice though.

- The cashier lady was loud and impatient.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103854866816776797/reviews
Ginger Keung,5,"The King of Prawn Noodles set meal is definitely worth trying, offering a wide variety of combinations featuring king prawns, including options with pork ribs, pig tail, and pig intestine. It's topped with a generous amount of chili powder, served either in a delicious soup or dry noodle style. The deep-fried chicken cutlets and Har Chong Chicken are also standout dishes. This place caters to both the young and old, providing a comfortable dining experience in a fully air-conditioned space on basement 1 Downtown East eHub.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110712500493299786160/reviews
ÈòøÂÆù,3,"To be honest, I ate better prawn noodle before‚Ä¶. but the pork belly rice is super nice!

Paid extra for the set meal but regretted as the prawn paste chicken wings are really not nice ü•π & the juice is too sweet ü•π

Staff are friendly & polite.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
Meng Pok Thum,4,"Nice place to have a quick meal, price is reasonable. The sets are value for money, just add $3 and you get a big cup of ice lemonade, or ice lemon tea, plus a side dish of your choice: chicken mid wings, fish balls, luncheon meat sticks, fried pork belly.
I think their prawn mee soup probably is the best in Pasir Ris, soup is rich and flavourful, and the consistency is good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117910893271871312647/reviews
