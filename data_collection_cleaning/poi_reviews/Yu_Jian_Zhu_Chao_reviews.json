      "text": "We’ve been super busy moving from Lakeside Jurong East to our new home here in Commonwealth Tanglin Halt. After all the unpacking and cleaning, we were absolutely starving and by then, it was already past 9PM. We headed down to check out the nearby hawker stalls, but most were already closed or didn’t quite have what we were looking for. Thankfully, a friend of my wife who’s also the mother of our landlord’s son told us about a stall that stays open until 1 AM and serves freshly cooked food.  When we got there, the guy at the stall had a bit of difficulty understanding us, but he kindly called a lady over who helped translate our order such a thoughtful gesture. I got the Sweet and Sour Pork with Rice and added a sunny side up egg, while my wife ordered the Garlic Pork. Both dishes were flavorful, freshly cooked, and totally satisfying exactly what we needed after a long day.",
