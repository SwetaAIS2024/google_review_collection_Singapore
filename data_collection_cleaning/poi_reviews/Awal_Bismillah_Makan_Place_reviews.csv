R Wee,5,"Great ambience.  Good food. Nice and cool sheltered dining with big fans that has an outdoor feel.  10% NTUC member discount applies. Good selection of mid priced muslim friendly food: halal zichar and satay, to western food.  Loved the mutton and babat satay as well as the fried beef horfun.  Would not recommend the beef burger (not a 100% beef patty, but a frozen proceesed one); and the kampong fried rice (no zing).  Drinks-wise liked the teh halia tarik.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102304589695353947734/reviews
