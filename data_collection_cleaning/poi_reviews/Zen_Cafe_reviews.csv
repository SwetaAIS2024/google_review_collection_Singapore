Eddie Yeou,5,"Truly a zen-like cafe to enjoy your afternoon tea/ coffee and light snacks and lunch. Food is nice. We ordered the vegetables bao and latte. Not very heavy meal. The atmosphere is superb. Just imagine light music ðŸŽ¶ playing at the background with aircon. You can quietly sip your hot latte and enjoy a book. It is truly a zen-like experience. Can get away from the busy, noisy and chaotic life and enjoy peace and serenity that is so so important!ðŸ˜€",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104643970770132746766/reviews
Mick Khoo,1,"Caught in surprise with double standard services. Kindly re-train your today's counter staff.
It's CNY, we understand. The staff could have tell us that today we are serving only CNY set instead if telling us no more fries all sold out.
You could said fries available with the set purchase right? see the receipt and items we order?
We sat near the counter and saw someone bought the fries separately, too?
Will revisit if such service provide even the food is nice? This is my 3rd visit receiving such services, really put me in doubts to consider.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116501253389905382151/reviews

Francis D,4,"Really love the vibe here at Zen cafe. So calming and relaxing, true to the spirit of its name and its location at the monastery. Vegetarian snacks were tasty and filling enough. There is a limited menu to choose from but sufficiently satisfying for a light and quick bite.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101110017999719372682/reviews
William,4,"The indoor cafe is definitely a great place to chill because it's not crowded, good vibe and ambiance (must have had a good ID designer), plenty of seating and even huge ceiling space. Location is inside the Guang Ming San (Brighthill) Temple.

Food is alright (just vegetarian snacks) but I was suprised that the cold brew had sugar in it which is a No-no.

I will probably hang out here again if I go to this temple.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114916696399917166666/reviews
