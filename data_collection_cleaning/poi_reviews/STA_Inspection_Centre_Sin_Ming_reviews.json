      "text": "I'm writing to commend on the exceptional service of a Ms Yvonne from STA Sin Ming (the branch that I'd called to enquire about the OBU installation). I'd earlier called LTA, out of exasperation after several failed attempts to secure an appointment from the LTA approved list of workshops. They'd all cited that they do not do installations for Jaguars. The very well spoken and extremely cordial and professional gentleman from LTA, Mr Ryan, then kindly referred me to STA for their assistance. Initially a very helpful Ms Ah Ling assisted with my enquiry. She had to check in with her colleague/s before ascertaining if STA can do the Installation given the make and model of my car. Shortly after, Ms Yvonne called and assured me of an alternative workshop. Her communication with me was exceptional throughout. I was thoroughly impressed with her level of professionalism and customer first persona. Definitely world class... and we certainly need to have more Yvonnes in our service industries right here right now in Singapore. Kudos to her.",

      "text": "The inspection itself was fine. Smooth payment, inspection and car collection. They could place better signage at the entrance leading to the inspection lanes. There was a bit of confusion there. All said, this is an exercise for nothing. A perfectly good car, less than 10 years old, just going through the motions of inspection. More suitable for cars above 10 years. Price was also pretty steep for such an easy process. Would have been fairer if they charge $30 instead of $76.",

If I am not mistaken there is a certain measurement from the top and sides to be followed but this guy seems like in a hell of a rush. I would estimate he did both in under 3 mins!!\nWish that he had more passion in his work.",
