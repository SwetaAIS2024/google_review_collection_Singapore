B T,1,"There's a very rude , non-approachable , unfriendly malay lady working there. Nobody deserves such bad attitude for no reason. Been to this branch many times to get
medications. She'll show a black face & attend to customers abruptly. This branch has 1 of the least traffic/not so busy compared to other branches. We do not understand why she's always unhappy behind the cashier counter. She might want to consider working in a non-customer facing environment.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113253727362397596765/reviews
vikki,1,"Malay auntie the headscarf is incredibly rude. I asked her politely 3 times to take my payment while she had her back turned to me ignoring me. When she finally turned round she gave me a dirty look, huffed at me and never spoke a single word. She should be fired.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117348026736099675059/reviews
