B C,2,Ridiculous service and self-collection wait time. I had made an order for buns self-collection days prior to collection date and even sent them a few messages before heading over to collect but was made to wait 45mins just to collect some buns. The admin personnel attending to me was nonchalant too even after I told her I was in a rush. The sales personnel I contacted with via WhatsApp is very slow in replying and inefficient too.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116533690969989880916/reviews

Ai Lin Yeo,1,"Ridiculous level of support for a regular customer who pays promptly. Sales personnel Cally is practically uncontactable—forever. Accounts demand payment before delivery of goods and if accounts or admin fails to respond to our order in time, we are penalised and will not receive our order despite payment. Seriously ridiculous. And now, it’s Saturday 230pm. We ordered for delivery of goods on Thursday way before order cut off time and they informed that there were too much order for Friday delivery and we will receive order on Sat. Now, we do not receive any order and calls or messages were just ignored. Seriously, I hope the boss can read this and do something about your team.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105377731320077031218/reviews
Jennifer Tan,1,"Found a job posted on an app here 2yrs ago jus to collect documents(cheque)and to pass a document to another building in MacPherson. Was told to come here and collect document according to the app and later on I had to call the person contact thru the app and told me the location but  never say building name and came here to check the reception doesn’t know what I’m talking about. I walk rounds buildings to building just to find the location.

Next day came again and the receptionist recognised my face again and before tat called the sender from the app told me the building
when all along she could have atleast told me the day before the name of the building and I was making rounds alone around this place alone the day before

And had to travel from my house come back again jus to collect document which is stupid thing to do, waste my time,energy and effort and money",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117758380229374015349/reviews
