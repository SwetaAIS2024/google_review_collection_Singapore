With its welcoming and minimalist atmosphere, it offers a delightful dining experience.\nOrdered the halibut which comes in a generous portion with chunky chips, we found the batter was too thick. The chargrilled chicken chop on the other hand was tender and flavorful.\nThe staff are friendly and attentive, adding to the pleasant dining experience.",

      "text": "Had the dory fish and chips (but halibut is available at 5 dollars more). High quality fish and chips that wont leave you feeling overly greasy/ get tired of eating.\n\nThe\"sidewinder\" chips/ fries were well seasoned and perfect for dipping in their tartar sauce (I highly recommend trying the thai tartar option.\n\nThe main drawback is that it is very pricey, 20 dollars for 1 slab of dory fish and some chips, but more than worth it once in awhile.",

      "text": "Came all the way from north east of Sg to check out what‚Äôs the social media hype with this place.\n\nOverall disappointed possibly due to the high expectations with all the hype and the high prices for such quality.\n\nDory fish and chip portion was larger than the usual size. Fish was fresh but batter was bland. A mile from those serve at lad & dad or lad & co, taste wise.\n\nAngus ribeye at $33 was a major let down. While properly cooked to my request of medium raw, the quality of the meat was below par. Tasted like those bought from supermarket. You are better off even at Aston.\n\nNosh chicken chop was ok. Nothing to shout about. There was a strange after taste with the chicken meat. The chicken chop at taman jurong is way ahead.\n\nThere was no choice of sides for the above dishes.\n\nService was very prompt and we were surprised by the quickly delivery of the food especially the angus beef.\n\nAmbience was dim and cosy, creating a more up-market feel to the place compared to other smilies western dish restaurants. However, the quality of the food just doesn‚Äôt justify for the relatively high prices charged.",

Meat of the fish and chips was tasteless while its batter was greasy. The chips were great though. Only bottled beers, no draft, were available.",
