      "text": "- Poor staff attitude.\n- Poor service.\n- Food quality and quantity is just like any other zhi char stall.\n- No cutlery but it is ok with me.\n- Ordered and paid $1.5($3 in total for 2x eggs) for a fried egg each to both rice. Came home only to find out there is none. Called the stall and they requested for a photo. Your cook and staff left it out and you have the cheek to demand otherwise. I will take it as giving $3, doing charity to your business. $3 is a darn “big horse chariot wheel” to you.",
