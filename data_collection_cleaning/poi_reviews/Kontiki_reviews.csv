Teck Boon,5,"Dog friendly restaurant both inside and outside! Ample amount of parking both at the restaurant compound or just across the road. Lovely to sit outside on a cool evening. The common bar food like chicken wings, fries etc are really good. Some of the main course menu items can be hit or miss but overall still a really nice place to be at for dinner when itâ€™s not too warm.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105978834231481267643/reviews
Trotting Horse,5,"This is a dog friendly cafe and also along the Marina Bay park connector walking route. So can stop by for a meal before continuing or end the walk here.

There is outdoor and indoor sitting. We opted for indoor. Very warm service staff who explains the menu when asked.

I had the salmon and avocado sandwich and it was a good and hearty one.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114960726223703734828/reviews

margaret tan,5,"Iâ€™m always back here for the pork chop! Generous slab and just the right amount of marination. The meat is tender and at the last bit, I always use my hands to chew the meat off the bone ðŸ˜„ have tried their other foods like onion bloom etc and itâ€™s also good! Service is not bad too! They serve me and my dog iced cold water when they saw me in beads of perspiration. My go to place for comfort food and chillax vibes ðŸ˜Š",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110468839876357952155/reviews
