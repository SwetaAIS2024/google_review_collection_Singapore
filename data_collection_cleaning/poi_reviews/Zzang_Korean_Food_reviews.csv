Jing Jie Ng,3,"Decent Korean food. Nothing really outstanding, just average straightforward meals served here.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108318175307818512445/reviews
Tyler Dixon,4,"Nothing fancy but a nice place to grab some Korean food. Prices were fair. The staff was flying, it was busy! The food was good for the price. Try a pancake. There is limited seating and it was full constantly. I saw a lot of take out. Thank you for the good experience. The chicken and pork bulgogi were enjoyable. The chef is cranking it out from a super tiny kitchen!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105739268163530272339/reviews
ML,3,"There’s no service charge no GST but price is still around restaurant price. Kimbap set was $11.90, kimchi soup or soft tofu soup $15.80, there’s also noodles, other types of soup, stir fry dishes etc. menu is quite extensive.

You order at the cashier then pay before you get a seat. Friendly enough prompt service.

The area is just like a makeshift nook of the old Bukit Timah plaza mall. Not much atmosphere or particularly Korean feel except a tv screen showing some dramas.

The portion isn’t very big. The soup bowl is smaller size than the Korean one I usually go to downstairs. There’s also only 3 small banchan side dishes. All very salty, the soup also quite salty.
Maybe if there’s more soup, it wouldn’t be quite so salty. The seafood is fresh enough.
One thing that’s well done is the rice. One of the better rice I’ve eaten at restaurants.
I wouldn’t travel for this Korean food, is just ok ok but if I’m in the area and craving Korean with no other options, then I’ll try it again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106421457478618430542/reviews
Wing Seng Chan,5,Thumbs up for the food. I had the Toufo Soup (spicy) and the seafood kimchi and both are great especially if you like spicy food. They top up the side dishes for free. Even better is there is no service charge and students get 10% off.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105552990408975757039/reviews
Vincent Khoo,3,"We ordered spicy ramen, spicy tofu soup and chicken bulgogi. Come with free banchan and price is reasonable. No GST or service charge. Food taste is passable and no need to wait too long too",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845981260181580873/reviews
