Asia Apparel,5,"Can't recall how many times we came here for the food, drinks and enjoying the beach for the past 2 decades. Always enjoyed the  perfectly made calamari combined with the chilli crab dip every trip. Big portions, free drinking water & great view. The staffs are polite and helpful. Self service ordering and pay at counter before they serve the food. Wide variety of drinks but no beer for this trip. Trying not to get drunk on a weekday.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112168507594751691491/reviews
Oleg Leonov,5,"not sure about the opinion on how beach clubs go, but this one was rather pleasant. plenty of space, access to the beach, shower, food, drinks. basically anything you could ask for. when you order you have to go and pay separately and the counter, membership of my Sentosa os strongly advised, as the benefits are stacking up and grant you quite a lot. occasional bog lizards visiting, but that is not an issue :-)",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114541839478904784766/reviews
Lina리나,5,"Stopped by on a Sunday night with no wait, which was great. The food was solid, and the 10/10 views added to the experience.

We had the seafood stew, Margherita pizza, and fish and chips. The complimentary baguette bread was a nice extra. A good spot for a meal with a view.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106170696251605505261/reviews
Steve Chen,1,"Staffs are rude. We inquired the price of availing the sunbed. The indian guy replied so rude, ""cannot bring outside food"". I replied, I can finish my drinks first since just a bit remaining. Then, he suddenly proceed to tell me rudely, ""need to pay sgd30 per person to stay"". And I confirm with other girl staff. And asked, if that fee is for staying only or consumable for food purchase. And she just nod, like no mood to talk more. I know they are looking down at us. Like we are not capable to pay it, so no need to answer our questions properly. They just entertain nicely those western customers.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115540911090715637719/reviews
Brett Holland,5,"This is the 2nd time we have been here, the last being a few years ago but it hasn't really changed. The staff were really friendly and helpful. The girl that came to our table to take our order instead of us having to order via a QR code was really nice and she was very helpful in helping us order some of our items. The food came quickly, though it wasn't that busy at that time but it was still nice and it was very tasty. It is very nice and relaxing sitting there looking out across the beach while you eat even though the weather wasn't that great today. It is a little on the expensive side but all up it was very good. Highly recommended.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115146144803669537445/reviews
