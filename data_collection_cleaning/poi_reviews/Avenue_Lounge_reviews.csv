Elijah Ng,1,"Avenue Lounge Singapore: Where you pay $50 to relive the worst parts of 2016—without even the courtesy of a free drink.

The DJ? Completely checked out, possibly operating on autopilot or just Googling “how to look busy.”

The music? A tragic time capsule of outdated tracks butchered by mixes so bad they should come with a trigger warning.

The crowd? Practically non-existent. They closed off sections like they were embarrassed too—which, honestly, they should be. The vibe is so dead even a funeral would feel insulted.

Save your money, your night, and your ears, this place is a hard pass.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110892753751756707274/reviews
Thesa T,1,"I want to share some feedback about a really disappointing experience I had at Avenue. As a long time customer, I’ve always enjoyed coming here, but this time things went terribly wrong. I went to the bar to order a Negroni and a these waiter took my credit card to process the payment but never gave it back. When I politely asked GABRIEL (Chinese waiter) for help, he became aggressive, slammed his hand on the table, and started shouting at me. It was completely unprofessional and shocking. I’m planning to file a police report, and I really hope Avenue management takes this seriously and addresses the situation, as it reflects poorly on the entire establishment. I trust this won’t happen to anyone else.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112095369550775250556/reviews
Sebastian Richard,1,"Horrible place! Disappointing service! We wanted to order 1 bottle as we went in for pre drinks at 10pm but was rejected. They said the minimum spend is 1k and we are unable to just buy 1 bottle of gin!

We stayed there for awhile and left shortly after at 11pm and head off to another night establishment!

Service staff was rude and not flexible! If you’re broke AF, enter at your own risk!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107352363332958754336/reviews

Rikitta Chowdhury,5,"Any trip of mine to Singapore is incomplete without visiting Avenue atleast once.
Love the vibes, the concept of arcade whilst sick beats are playing by the Dj. The food is my favorite part!! Absolutely delicious finger bites and a perfect weekend spot to enjoy with friends!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110389810964359209352/reviews
