hyunjincore,1,"absolutely horrible. we checked in for two rooms and they say they only accept cash as payment; no qr, no cards. the area around the hotel feels eerily and very quiet even in the afternoon. there are plenty of unopened stores around this area with alot of foreigners just roaming around. my mother had booked two rooms; one for me and my two sisters and one for my parents and smaller siblings. one room couldn’t be unlocked and my dad had to go back down to ask the receptionist. took more than 30 minutes for them to come up and open the door. i was already irritated by this point.

when it was finally opened, air conditioning was bad. the lowest temperature was still hot. the wallpapers were peeling, the lock of one window in the bathroom was broken. the tap water was rusty, bathroom door couldnt even be opened properly. stained bathroom walls. I’ve been to so many cheap hotels and I have to say this is the WORST i’ve ever been to. the false advertisement is insane. ruined my whole day to be honest. the hotel staff weren’t very friendly. as soon as i walked in, i knew i had to complain about this whole horrific experience. its just HORRIBLE! i hate it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106291942293720179026/reviews
Vinothrra Murugayah,4,"The service was great, sent people immediately to rooms to get things checked. Friendly receptionist. The room had everything we needed. Only problem was there were loud noises outside our room in the evening and early 5 am. Loud thuds you'd hear in a construction site.. Disrupted our sleeps for a bit but that's the issue. We were satisfied with everything else.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113605338783539670028/reviews
Ming Hui Tan,1,"My stay at Nusa CT was the dirtiest and scariest experience I’ve ever had in a hotel. Upon entering the room, I was immediately greeted by a sticky carpet floor that reeked of unwashed bodies. The air conditioning was broken, and within minutes, I was being bitten by mosquitoes. It was clear that this room had not been maintained for years.

I approached the receptionist to request a new room, but she initially refused, claiming the hotel was fully booked. Only after I insisted on the uninhabitable condition of the room did she provide a replacement.

Unfortunately, the new room was not much better. Although it lacked the sticky carpet, the air conditioning barely worked, emitting mostly warm air. The towels were full of holes, and the toilet bowl was clogged.

After taking a quick bath, my nightmare at Nusa CT continued as we spent two hours searching for a new hotel. This was the worst experience for RM 89, and I strongly advise against staying at this hotel.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103443509470339653310/reviews
