Quick Sing Yen,5,"If I were to rate the entire meal with stars 🌟:

👉Tom Yam ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - The most delicious Tom Yam I've had in Johor! The rich, spicy, and tangy flavor with the perfect balance of creaminess makes it a standout dish. Truly authentic! 🍲🔥

👉Pandan Fried Chicken⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, with the aromatic infusion of pandan. It’s a dish you wouldn’t want to miss. 🌿🍗

👉Salted Fish Stir-Fried Kailan ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - The perfect fusion of greens and salted fish. You get the right amount of flavor and saltiness in each bite. 🌱🐟

👉Thai Milk Tea⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Smooth, perfectly balanced, not too sweet, just like the ones you get in Thailand. A refreshing and satisfying drink! 🧋💛

👉Egg Omelette⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - A must-have pairing with Tom Yam, fluffy and just right. It complements the spiciness perfectly. 🍳💛

Such an amazing experience overall, every dish was flavorful and delicious! Highly recommend. 😊",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114068553418995970015/reviews
