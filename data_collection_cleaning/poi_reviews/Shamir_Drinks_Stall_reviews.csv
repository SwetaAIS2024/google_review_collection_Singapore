HuyenLy Nguyễn,5,"The best drink stall in the neighbourhood. I normally order kopiccino from them - a special drink with kopi base and pulled milk foam. It's very interesting to see how the barista pulled the milk to make foam for this drink - I can tell that he's extremely proud of his skill too. You can also request the sugar level and he will accommodate your request - pretty good service for a neighbourhood drink stall.

They are the only drink stall with sugarcane juice in the cluster - very fresh and great taste sugarcane, squeezed on request. They also have a big menu with interesting items to try. Highly recommended.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112662903049952941403/reviews
Kia Guan Ng,5,Here serves one of the best teh halia in Singapore and some said JB. There’s always a queue at the stall and the only time I find no queue is when the stall is closed. It closes early on Friday as the boss needs to go for Friday prayers.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108972979221461010763/reviews
