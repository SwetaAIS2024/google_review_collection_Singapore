Takahiro Koyama,3,"There are four McDonald's at Changi: T2 (Public Area & Transit Area), T3 (Public Area), and JEWEL (B1F).

This one at T3 is in a quiet area, so you can relax and take your time. It's open 24 hours, which makes it perfect for late-night or early-morning flights. The place is always clean and comfortable, which is another big plus.

The menu includes classic items like hamburgers and Big Macs that you can find worldwide, along with some Singapore-only specials.

Don't miss the local flavors like the Satay Burger, Ha Cheong Gai Burger, and Thai Milk Tea Frapp√© ‚Äî these are unique to Singapore and definitely worth trying!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109971102286888264645/reviews
Benedict Correya,5,"Stopped by McDonald‚Äôs at Changi Airport Terminal 3 for dinner and tried the McChicken meal and Chicken McCrispy. The McChicken was fresh, with a crispy patty and just the right amount of mayo‚Äîsimple but satisfying. The Chicken McCrispy had a nice crunch on the outside and was juicy inside, definitely a good pick if you‚Äôre craving fried chicken.

The place is spacious with plenty of seating, so finding a spot wasn‚Äôt a hassle. Ordering was quick and smooth with the self-service kiosks, and the food came out fast despite the evening crowd.

If you‚Äôre in T3 and want a quick, no-fuss meal, this McDonald‚Äôs is a solid choice‚Äîhot food, fast service, and a comfortable place to sit and enjoy.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292377967743781974/reviews

She always went the extra miles to ensure all her customers ended up with an enormously sublime dinning experiences in her T3 Changi Airport McDonalds Restaurant outlet. She is always especially attentive & observant to all her individual regular customers' wants by sparing no pains to resolve their concerns & finally warmed the hearts of all regular customers. Ms Rosanna had even taught me on how to download the McDonalds APP. Indeed, really thumbs up her spontaneous helpful good nature. From here, I automatically learn some IT knowledge from her. So lucky to meet Ms Rosanna at T3 Changi Airport McDonalds.
Although Ms Rosanna is merely a cog in the wheel of the Goliath McDonalds Restaurant organization, her superlative valuable customer service really speak volumes and make a difference in the super big global McDonald's family organization.
Truly, Ms Rosanna is a credit to the whole Singapore McDonalds Family Organization. She is a precisely a McDonalds Shining Star to boost up the business profits for the T3 Changi Airport McDonalds Restaurant outlet. I strongly encourage more and more
McDonalds Restaurant outlets Staffs in Singapore to mimic her { Winning Customer Service  Attitude } so as to transform McDonalds Restaurant into a Surefire Prime Dining Paradise in the whole of Singapore and especially in the Changi Airport.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116122836770254136221/reviews
