      "text": "Hidden gem towards the back of an unassuming coffeeshop away from the main road.\nWell known for their Dang gui (Chinese herb) seasoned roast duck. The beautifully roasted duck comes ladled with a sweet noxious herbal concoction of a sauce which elevates the richness of the fatty duck meat.\nTheir roast pork is also crispy and worth trying.\nGot there around their close of business hours so the meats were understandably a little dried out and noodles weren't available.\nWill better plan the revisit to enjoy the duck at its finest.",

It gets busy during lunchtime.\n\nRoasted 当归 duck was delicious and not overpowering the flavours of the duck. The roasted pork belly skin was super crispy and overall the meats here were fantastic!",

We would have preferred it to be the #HappierChoice type - i.e. unabashedly MORE FAT!\n\nThe hor fun (\"ipoh kway teow\" version as is the norm for roast meat stalls) was excellent too in that it was done still stretchy with some bite as opposed to boiled till a mushy texture that rivals mee sua in some other stalls.",

If you prefer less spicy Tom Yum, the Thai zi char does one that even children can enjoy. The deep fried sea bass with mango salad is fresh and has no odor (for those with sense palates). The service is warm; the chef came out to chat with us. He said they serve local stir fry on request. We will come again, with friends and family.",
