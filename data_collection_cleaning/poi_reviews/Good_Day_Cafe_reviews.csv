Mabbel Elroy,3,"Located in the Medicine and Science Library (the building is right beside the bus stop to science canteen), walk all the way in and you’ll find this open concept cafe.

Rice bowls are average, sautéed mushroom tasted like Chinese economic rice mushrooms instead of the western cafe style.

Spanish latte was really good, as well as the taro latte.

Seats (and tables) are very limited especially during lunch hours, so do expect to takeaway and have your meal/coffee somewhere else.

Would return for the coffee but maybe not for the food.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102879096020874056848/reviews
Nigel Ong,2,"I've bought breakfast from this store several times, but lately they seem to consistently get my coffee order wrong. It's happened twice now. Both times I ordered regular kopi, but was given kopi o (no sugar)??? I don't know if it's the issue with the order taker, the person making it or maybe the order chit wasn't clear enough? They might want to look into it... Will have to dbl check all my orders from now on...",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100417068719021830101/reviews

Kristina Vaklinova,5,"Nice Cappuccino for S$3.50 with the option to replace dairy milk with Oatside. The bowls are delicious, good portions, and very reasonably priced. I also like their tuna croissants, which they toast for you. A good addition to an  otherwise dull Kent ridge.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113797566261062383812/reviews
Chen Wei Pow,5,"Ordered Taro Latte. It’s yummy, not too sweet, with gentle taro taste.
Nice and quiet environment since it’s located in a library. The cafe is pretty as well!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117822897181140017879/reviews
