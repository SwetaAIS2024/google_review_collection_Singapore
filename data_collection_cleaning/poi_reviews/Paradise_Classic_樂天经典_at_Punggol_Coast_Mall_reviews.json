      "text": "Paradise Classic (Punggol Coast Mall): Delicious Food and Excellent Service in a Charming Setting (5/5 Stars)\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n• Food Quality: 5/5 (Delicious hor fun with \"wok hei,\" excellent ebiko fried rice)\n\n• Service: 5/5 (Top-notch service)\n\n• Value: 4/5 (Slightly pricier than average, but justified by quality)\n\n• Ambiance: 5/5 (Warm and inviting, blending modern comfort with traditional Singaporean aesthetics)\n\nOverall: 5/5 Stars\n\nParadise Classic at Punggol Coast Mall exceeded expectations! Donkey & I, initially planned to dine at Aston due to a promotional offer, the long queue steered us towards Paradise Classic, and we're so glad it did. We ordered a delightful selection: Carlsberg beer, crispy prawn rolls, braised prawn broth hor fun, and prawn-infused ebiko fried rice. The hor fun was a standout, boasting a delicious \"wok hei\" flavour that I thoroughly enjoyed. Donkey's fried rice was also a hit, particularly when mixed with the provided sambal belacan chili. The overall dining experience was enhanced by the top-notch service provided by the restaurant staff.\n\nThe ambiance at Paradise Classic is warm and inviting, with a design that blends modern comfort with a nod to traditional Singaporean aesthetics. The restaurant's décor incorporates nostalgic imagery of old Singapore, creating a charming and familiar atmosphere. Comfortable seating adds to the overall pleasant dining experience. It's a nice balance of modern and traditional, making it suitable for a wide range of diners.\n\nWhile slightly pricier than average, the quality of the food and service at Paradise Classic makes it a worthwhile dining destination. Highly recommended!",
