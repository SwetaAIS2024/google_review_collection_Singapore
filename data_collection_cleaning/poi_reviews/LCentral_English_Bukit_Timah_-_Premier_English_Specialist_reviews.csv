Helen Park,5,"My child has been taking English lessons at the Bukit timah center for nearly 2 years and enjoys taking classes every week at the center.

Classes are taught by professional teachers. Classes are small groups, where the teacher focuses more on the students, and the teacher provides detailed feedback on the day. Center staff also pay a lot of attention to student management.

In particular, during a difficult time due to the corona virus this year, the center provided excellent online classes so that there would be no gaps in the classes.

As I watch my child's skills grow step by step, I express my warm gratitude to both teachers and staff.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110728321463540780703/reviews
