Talk to him nicely, he shout and you and seems he couldnt have patience to listen to orders. If u r not happy working, why don‚Äôt you just pack your bags and quit. Food is nice but for such attitude, not worth to come back a second time",

      "text": "LATEST UPDATE: Came back to eat here again after my bad experience n this time I‚Äôm very satisfied. Excellent as before ‚Äî I had roast duck with roast pork n char siew with rice, $8 only; everything delicious n good portion. My faith is restored.üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç\n\nUPDATE: Two months ago I raved about Teik Kee‚Äôs roast pork, duck meat n char siew (see below review). Unfortunately I had the worst experience recently with the same dish. The char siew was so chewy that it had to be swallowed whole even after much chewing. The duck meat was dry, hard n tough. They were inedible. I took a few bites n gave up. For the meat to be so tough n so chewy, something must be badly wrong. This stall shouldn‚Äôt spoil its reputation by serving such bad meat. Better to discard the meat than sell them to save cost.\n\nThe chubby guy should also not be so grouchy when customers asked questions from the front of the stall instead of from the side; new customers wouldn‚Äôt know the side is where they should make their orders or enquiries. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to reply to customers who talk to you from the front n then tell them to order from the side. We know it‚Äôs a tough line to be in and we don‚Äôt even expect common courtesy; but we certainly don‚Äôt want to have to put up with a grouchy glare.\n\nThe above is feedback for Teik Kee. I have not changed my earlier 5 stars rating.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAll thumbs up for Teik Kee at Food Loft, Lor 35A Geylang. I‚Äôve been coming here for my roast pork, duck and char siew rice ever since I stopped here for dinner a month ago. For someone very particular about the taste of this dish, I can say it‚Äôs among the few I love. The meat portion is more than generous, the taste is among the best I‚Äôve had, the price at $7.50 for the 3-meat combination I had is great value for money. Highly recommended. Trust me.üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",
