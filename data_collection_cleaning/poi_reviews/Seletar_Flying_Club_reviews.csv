vonne Tong,5,Thanks to Zikry who helped my husband arranging this surprise birthday experience for me and I have indeed an awesome experience on this trial morning flight within Spore sky.  The pilot has patiently explained how to fly a plane and enjoyed the beautiful scenery in the boundary sky.  The best part is I can participate in landing the plane.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108102400361349747119/reviews
