      "text": "Came on a weekday lunch. It was quite empty and quiet with only one other patreon. There weren't any pastry/desserts on the display shelves. Was considering if the place was even open initially.  Bought the Chicken Chop served fried instead of grilled with black pepper sauce & wedges. Chicken Carbonara was more diluted than creamy but flavourful. Bought iced chamomile tea and iced mango tea with honey. The food and drinks was ok but I wouldn't come back again. Staff were approachable & friendly though. Thank you!",

      "text": "Came in for dinner. The ambience was really nice, there wasnâ€™t too much crowd so it was a quite and comfortable dinner. The cleanliness was good. The waiter was fast at attending us and the food took around 15-20 mins to arrive so it depends on how hungry you are to rate how fast that was. The drinks came first before the food and they were all impeccable! The drinks are not too sweet which is a plus point. The food was amazing too but i think the carbonara was cooked in the same pot for my friends because they came in different amount of pasta, chicken and cream sauce. The chicken chop was very good too, the blackpepper sauce was the highlight of the meal.\nThe price lies on the slightly higher range but overall a good experience!",

Dried chili chicken rice ~ worth to try. Sweet n spicy\nService = accommodating and respectful\nAtmosphere = kinda dark and not so instagrammable deco. Can do improvement by injecting color or surprises (i saw they fond to older music - maybe can promotes this)",
