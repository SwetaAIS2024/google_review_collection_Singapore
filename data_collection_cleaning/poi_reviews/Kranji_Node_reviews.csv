Avril Atkeg,3,"Very short section of the northern stretch of the Rail Corridor. It's just around 500m of gravelly path, which is quite exposed to the elements. Be prepared to have a raincoat in case of rain and a cap or hat for the sunny stretch.

Nothing exciting to see along the way in terms of flora, but there were quite a few bird species such a white-bellied eagle and kingfishers.

As it's such a short walking stretch starting from Kranji MRT Station, walkers or hikers need to go further along the Rail Corridor trail to get exercise. Took only 50 minutes from this node to reach Stagmont Trail, which is near Yew Tee Mrt station.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113878502697192504018/reviews
