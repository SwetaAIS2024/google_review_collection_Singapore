A young and very patient guy, explained all the fine details and advice on the better plan that’s more suitable for me. I signed up for 2 additional lines. Pleasant transaction. Very friendly and helpful guy. Very rare to encounter someone who’s helpful in the telecommunications services. Thanks for brighten up my day. Cheers",

I asked the resentative if I can purchase a wireless charger, and whether it is compatible with my phone which he responded to with \"yes\"  Only after I test it (which was not allowed in the store), now I find out I need another wireless adaptor to use the wireless charger... I'm quite disappointed with the staff knowledge.",
