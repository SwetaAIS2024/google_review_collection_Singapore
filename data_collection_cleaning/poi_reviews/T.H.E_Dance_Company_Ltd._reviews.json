      "text": "Taking the Foundational Contemporary Dance course was an incredible experience. Our instructor, Yixuan was patient, and I learned not just about movement, but about spatial awareness - when to contract, when to release, when to push, when to pull.\n\nIt becomes a course of sensing the body, loosening tension, learning the balance of surrendering and control, fluidity and composure. How you feel in your own skin.\n\nYixuan’s approach is both insightful and intuitive, encouraging us to trust our bodies and connect deeply with the rhythm of movement. If you’re looking to deepen your understanding of contemporary dance while cultivating a greater awareness of your body and space, I highly recommend this course!",

The immersive and captivating performance brought us from their beautiful studio space out into the Goodman Arts Centre space and beyond. The quality of contemporary dance was truly on another level. I loved the sound design as well. I will definitely be catching more of their future shows :D",

      "text": "I enjoyed myself so much and I think that’s number 1 when it comes to trying new things. I have zero dance experience but Kim and the students were very encouraging, patient and open to receiving this clueless two-left-feet adult human bean. However to be fair to myself, I have been practicing yoga for years. I’d say that helped tremendously in terms of flexibility and mobility. Even then, I’d defer to the Introductory class instead to understand the poses and transitions in-between. For someone who hasn’t been active at all, it’s better to start with Intro classes. Thank you THE!!",

I also like that those who take part are mostly working, & very friendly. Only gripe is that sometimes choreo involves a lot of turning - but maybe it's a good challenge.",
