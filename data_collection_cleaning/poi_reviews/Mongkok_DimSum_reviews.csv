Emily,5,"The food here is incredible. Me and my fiance came here 3 times (2 in person and 1 takeaway) within 15 hours, it was THAT good. Love that itâ€™s open 24 hours too! The dim sum is to die for! Really cheap prices too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100523784361599781305/reviews
William Lu,4,"At first didn't feel like eating here cause it looked empty but tried it anyway. It was good.

Didn't eat my siew mai cause my daughter finished them all, it took quite a while for the steamed order to come so didn't feel like ordering more.

The staff was friendly, it was raining outside and borrowed an umbrella to get to my car.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
Joshua Wong,3,"Hard to find a Dimsum place that opens 24 hours but this. I went on a weekday morning and there are plenty of seats. I do see that most patrons are tourists living around the vicinity.

The dim sum here is just mediocre; the very basis of dim sum -Har gow and Siew Mai - did not appeal to me at all. While it is understandable that most of the dim sums are not made freshly on the spot but from some central kitchen, somehow both do not taste as good.

The steamed carrot cake is too soft to my liking; breaks easily upon gripping with the chopsticks. The bean curd roll in Thai sauce does not taste good; probably the sauce is not fresh.

On the contrary, the spinach dumpling and scallop dumpling are both quite tasty but not the crystal chives dumpling; too soft like it has been over-steamed.

The fried dim sum did not get too wrong for the fried wanton and yam pastry with meat filling appeared to be the best dishes among all.

Apart from the reasonable price and the 24-hour convenience, a second visit for me may not happen in the near future. Perhaps, I may try the other dim sums on the menu on my next visit, hopefully it may change my perception on this dim sum establishment.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107244780137289771541/reviews
James Tan,4,"Here for supper.

Dim sum was slightly above average but valuable price wise. Go for the Beef Hor Fun, best among the food I had there.

Service can be non existence so diner with no expectation.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117062738924400571535/reviews
Ann Ogden,4,"Geylang Road has a wide variety of eateries.

We had a late meal Saturday (5th).

He had noodles and we shared dim sum. The carrot cake was delicious.
