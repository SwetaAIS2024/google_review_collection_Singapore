      "text": "Imagine a bowl of 小碗麵 (small bowl noodles) that is a delightful symphony of flavors and textures. The al dente noodles are perfectly cooked, offering a satisfying bite with each mouthful. The tender pork slices, marinated in chili and vinegar, bring a balance of heat and tang that dances on your palate. The addition of a soft-boiled egg adds a rich, creamy element, blending seamlessly with the broth and noodles. And to top it all off, the fresh prawn introduces a sweet, succulent note, complementing the savory depth of the dish. Each ingredient harmonizes to create a delicious and memorable experience.",

The half-cooked spaghetti with baked chicken was terrible, while the mini pot noodle and minced meat noodle were mediocre at best—far inferior to what you’d find at Bendemeer Market.\n\nUnfortunately, this was a one-time visit for us. We won’t be returning.",

Had the mini wok and it came with a large fresh prawn, which was nice. Ingredients were fairly generous. Noodles quantity was so so but sufficient for an average eater. Not very accessible but ok for those who drive.",
