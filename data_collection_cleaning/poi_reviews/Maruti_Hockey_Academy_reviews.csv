Shivram Chandrasekhar,5,"Can't speak more highly of the hockey coaches at Maruti. They are dedicated, motivated, inspirational and true role models for the kids. Both my son and daughter keenly enjoy their weekly hockey sessions and eagerly look forward to them.

My daughter was recently crestfallen because she didn't have sufficient fellow girl players in the same age group to form a team for Pesta Sukan. Coaches Vijayan and Rege went the extra mile, reached out to their network and convinced another team  to accommodate her. She is thrilled and incredibly grateful to them! It shows their genuine commitment to the sport and their overarching desire to give each child the opportunity to participate and excel.

Cheers,
Shivram",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114021246067299577244/reviews
