The environment is good, and the teachers dedicated, they truly care for the kids. Other than academic, the center also constantly arrange many activities to engage the students.  Most importantly, my son loves Playfacto. It is like his 2nd home.",

My daughter settled in very quickly in its rather cozy environment and she is happy to be there. The teacher is also dedicated to ensuring my daughter’s homework, if any, is done. All in all, my experience with the Marymount centre has been positive and I would most certainly recommend it.",
