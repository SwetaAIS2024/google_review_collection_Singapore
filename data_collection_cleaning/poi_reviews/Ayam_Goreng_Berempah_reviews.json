      "text": "Lempeng is a traditional Malay pancake cooked until golden brown and slightly crispy on the edges made from a simple batter of flour, coconut milk, and a pinch of salt. It is a lesser known classic Malay dish often whipped quickly by mothers at home to feed the family with a simple rustic soulfood pancake that can be muai or plentiful made with just a few handy ingredients found at home. It is a versatile base to be eaten with sambal or any savoury dish found in the house. For me memories of my umi serving it with her signature inviting sambal tumis — be it with ikan bilis or anchovies or prawn or sotong kering, which is dried squids, or plain hard boiled eggs— drew me to sample this offered by the nondescript looking Ayam Goreng Berempah by Griddle stall at Bedok Food Centre. To be honest I set my expectation low, hoping it'll just be decent good light meal that I prefer after Friday's prayers. What I got pleasantly surprised was a freshly-made generous set of 2 pancakes stacked invitingly warm and soft to the touch with a side of sambal tumis ikan bilis that ignited a flood of sweet happy memories. And it is wonderfully delish too. I've had others here but often if they are not served cold premade they come to the table disappointingly almost tasteless flat and plain, relying on the sambal accompaniment for flavour. These are hearty lightly tasty and are sedap enough that they can even be eaten on their own. Told my wife about it and certainly it won't be the last time I'll grab these when I crave for them.\n\nGo try them for yourself. As for the rest of their offerings I'll sample each soon too.",

      "text": "Ordered the nasi goreng tomyam ayam after seeing a food vlogger post about it on tiktok. Was not disappointed. Generous portion with delicious ayam goreng. The nasi goreng tomyam was nice and spicy. Also had some sambal chilli added on the side which only made the rice and chicken taste better. Will return and try the other dishes.",
