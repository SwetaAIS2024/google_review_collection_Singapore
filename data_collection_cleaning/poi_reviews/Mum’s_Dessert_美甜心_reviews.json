After returning back, the auntie told me that need to pay extra $0.40 for the 2 noodles plastics bag (the plastics bag is smaller than NTUC plastics bag and is much more expensive).\n\nAuntie explained that take away need extra 40 cents as I only bought container for the soup and didn't bring container for the noodles.\n\nPreviously I bought the noodles, took away also $0.20 for a food container.\n\nAuntie cooked the wrong noodles that I requested. I being nice and say is ok.\n\nVery dissatisfied and disappointed with the service.",
