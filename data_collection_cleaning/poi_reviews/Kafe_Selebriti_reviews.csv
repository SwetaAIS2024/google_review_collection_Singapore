Sean Sean,4,"Quite a nice little cafe near tuas checkpoint where Mydin supermarket is located. Can see that the owner's pride n efforts in setting up this eatery. Food n drinks are all ok.  I had beef Mee rebus for Rm18, while my friend had seafood Mee goreng (got cockle)

Price point on the high side... But it's aircon n with deco so price naturally higher.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106961859890315476383/reviews

------------- 🍌 goreng 🧀 8.Feb.25 -----------
Bought 🍲 again fr this 🍴 . this ⌚ ordering just by Grab 🍲 food. have ordered Pisang Goreng Cheese. Overall, 🤔 could give rate between 4.5 -5.0 out of 5.0.
The banana itself are not naturally sweet - thts good & suits wt my taste.. ☑️This is bcoz thy add toppings which covered later here

Thy fried 🍌 covered wt their own flour -which xso feel salty o sugary ☑️
- x overcooked yet crunchy stil ☑️

The toppings :
** had put some additional notes for them to ➕ more 🧀 anyway.. & thy did ☑️
- slightly condensed milk as a savoury like others sellers ☑️☑️  - for me it's really gooo..ood  yet, more fatty2 creamy taste - due to xtra 🧀 added
- for those looking for 🍌 🧀 which xso sweet savoury stil, can come this 🍴

Last but least, the packaging is better - quite thin paper box yet safe!
As usual, best serve while stil hot ♨️",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107429129719066148710/reviews
Risda Nasuha Bachri,5,"For a cafe, this place have a quite wide variety of food, which is good. We ordered 3 dish, and our favorite is Afghani Pulao. Their hot Teh Tarik & iced lemon tea also taste just right.

The ambiance also good, and the staffs are nice. Oh, and if you're a fan of football, you'll love their decoration so much.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100458626739071998563/reviews
Khirman,5,"This cozy, laid-back café has such a welcoming vibe and serves some truly flavorful dishes. I tried the Nasi Goreng Ayam and Nasi Goreng Daging, both paired with sambal, and they were absolutely spot-on! If you’re in Nusajaya, this place is definitely worth a visit. Highly recommend!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104823696548735024833/reviews
