Ashley Liew,5,"Always a great experience here with a wide  selection of items, from food to even baby accessories. It‚Äôs a bit smaller compared to some of the other FairPrice Finest outlets but still a decent size given it is in the heart of downtown. Always appreciate the service here that never fails to be friendly and professional even during peak hours. After checkout, feel free to ring the bell if you also appreciate their good service! üôèüèª",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Ivan Lam,5,"Recently reopened in 111 Somerset, the product offering at this Fairprice Finest is rather extensive and you should be able to get most of your groceries here.

Flo Yeow,5,"Quite a smart move to connect many shops on the ground floor together, to form a supermarket. They carry one of the finest freshest ingredients, and the level of convenience is just impeccable. Came here for a bottle of wine before we headed off to dinner. Definitely will return for last minute groceries, or patronize here regularly enough if I'm staying around here.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
