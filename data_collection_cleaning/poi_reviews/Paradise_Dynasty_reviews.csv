Earoel Kennedy,4,"This is a good spot for a wide variety of flavourful dishes. The menu features well-executed familiar Chinese dishes, making it a great spot for a satisfying meal.

The ambiance is casual, with comfortable seating and a pleasant atmosphere. Service is generally efficient, though it can be slightly slow.

While prices are a bit on the higher side, it’s good for the quality of the food.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105782077382160797659/reviews
Desmond H,5,"If you’re a fan of comforting, flavorful soups, this place serves an excellent pickled fish soup with generous, fresh fish slices. The broth is well-balanced—tangy, slightly spicy, and packed with umami, making it a perfect dish for any weather. The portion size is satisfying, and the fish is tender without any unwanted fishy taste. One bowl can feed at least three adults!

A pleasant surprise was their new shredded pork pastry—crispy on the outside, with a savory and well-seasoned pork filling inside. It’s a perfect side dish that complements the soup beautifully.

Great food, fresh ingredients, and a must-visit for those who enjoy hearty, comforting Chinese cuisine. Definitely coming back for more!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109715996107965976871/reviews
Cindy T,3,"We had our reunion lunch at this branch. First time there but finds the dishes too salty to our liking. It would be good to reduce the saltiness and i would think all dishes would be recommended dish. We like the Buddha Jump over the wall soup and their dessert. Not to forget their puer tea, its smooth and addictive. All of us kept drinking, maybe it is due to the salty dishes.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110981209964836286351/reviews
Julie Sin,4,"8th day of Lunar New Year 2025.
The food portion is very generous. The dishes were served a bit too quickly all at the same time that the table was full of dishes and it was difficult to turn the lazy susan as it keep knocking into cups and bowls LOL
Taste wise, I personally find too much sauces was used in almost all the dishes which made me full very soon and thirsty.
The abalone yusheng was my favorite out of all. Followed by scallop & prawn.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105948443341037791792/reviews
YS T,1,"This is my feedback to Paradise Dynasty about yesterday Reunion Dinner set…

We booked a $368 Reunion Dinner set 福寿绵绵 on the eve of CNY at VivoCity but adjusted quantity to provide for 5pax @$460 (I.e paid extra for one additional pax)

They served us just 4 bowls of soup at the start and 4 bowls of dessert at the end. Makes me question if the portions for the dishes in between were also lesser than it should be. It turned out that we seemed to get the original set quantity for 3-4pax (as compared with quantity of another neighbouring table with family of 3) except with addition bowls of 海鲜四宝湯soup and 贵妃银耳桃胶dessert! The extra bowls of soup/dessert were only delivered separately upon repeated requests!

We strongly felt “being taken a ride” that we were made to pay additional $100 for just extra bowls of soup & dessert!

Personally, I wouldnt recommend this CNY set meal. The quality and quantity doesn’t justify the price, we would not be coming back.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107556722787275881794/reviews
