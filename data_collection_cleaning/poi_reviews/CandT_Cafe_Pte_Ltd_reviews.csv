Karen K,4,Very conveniently located coffee shop serving a good variety of food. The food stall with the longest queue belongs to the one selling a superb bowl of prawn mee. Both soup version and dry version was so good. They were also generous with their pork lard which enhances the flavor. The broth is absolutely flavorful.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102882223208614112953/reviews
Whimsy Lee,5,Food & customer service was good. Enjoyed the Thai style tofu. Not a fault of the f&b establishment but there tend to be smokers smoking right outside of the no smoking area.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101489709479638668497/reviews
