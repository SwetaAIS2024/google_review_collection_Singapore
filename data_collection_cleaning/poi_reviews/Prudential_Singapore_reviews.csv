Jojo,1,"Prudential’s customer platform lacks transparency, making it difficult to access clear policy information. Both financial advisers and customer service representatives often appear uninformed, and responses—especially via email—are slow and inaccurate. Additionally, the company has been late with premium deductions and bonus payments, which does not inspire confidence in its reliability. Given these experiences, I would not consider purchasing from them again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113880040403142227722/reviews
