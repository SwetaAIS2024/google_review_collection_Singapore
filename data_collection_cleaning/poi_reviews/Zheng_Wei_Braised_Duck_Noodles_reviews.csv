Alvin Lim,4,"Duck noodles is saucy and tasty.I Like the noodles texture, soup taste blend initially, but it's actually quite nice.. Meats are tender and taste nice. Not spicy, recommended if you prefer sweet tasting duck noodles.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107849967178992074864/reviews
Chong How,5,"Kway is in a huge bowl, soup is warm n nice, not too salty.

Han Yu Tan,4,"I got the braised duck leg noodle which costs $6.5. I also added on an egg, some pork belly slices, and tofu for 50c each. The duck noodles are really good, very well flavoured, not too salty but still brimming with flavour. It’s just a bit on the oilier side which you can wash down with the soup given. The pork belly slices are really good, very tender and nice flavour. I would really recommend the tofu as it’s just tofu, but if you like it you can try.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110231907823839530082/reviews
MNG,5,"Though located in a relatively obscured part of Bukit Panjang, it is a well known braised duck stall.

It offers rice, noodle and porridge options.

Kway teow is most traditional type which is thicker, giving it more chew and rice flavor. Mixed with its braising and chili sauces, it is a potent combination.

The rice had a savory soy sauce mix.

Braised duck was moderately braised with a good flavor and texture.

Its pricing is attractive and geared towards working crowd.

Highly recommended.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
Touristmouse,4,"For over two decades, this braised duck stall has been my go-to comfort food. Nestled at Blk 257 Bangkit Road Food Hub Coffeeshop, their legacy stretches back to nearby Kim San Leng Coffeeshop, where I used to wait a legendary 40 minutes just for a taste.
While the lines may be shorter these days, the rich herbal taste in their noodle soup still hits the spot every time. It's truly one of the most flavorful duck noodle soups I've had in Singapore!
Their signature dry version packs a fiery punch, but I always find the accompanying soup surprisingly bland compared to the noodle soup version. Lately, I've also noticed a bit of inconsistency in the duck meat – sometimes tender, sometimes a touch tougher. Perhaps it's just a temporary blip, but consistency is one area where they could regain their peak level. Also, they have replaced the made from scratch shallots toppings with store bought ones.
Despite these recent observations, there's no denying this stall deserves a top spot in any duck noodle ranking. The soup alone is a masterpiece, and the nostalgia factor adds to the charm.

My recommendation: Kway Teow Noodle Soup and top up with an egg $4.70

The duck wings are yummy too but often sold out early.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110409011587721664076/reviews
