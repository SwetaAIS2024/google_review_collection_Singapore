Jieling Teo,4,"had a company cny luncheon here ytd, we had the bountiful package! no wow factor for food but its pretty good like standard tze char good, and portion was good too! kudos to the staff who tried to hype us up for photo-taking sessions and also the caishenye to bring up the cny mood in the beginning! also, thank you to edmund, the event manager, for accommodating our requests and giving us a private room for our event. and plus points!! they have vegetarian option as well and i am pleasantly amazed! :) did not take any photos but the mock meat were done so well!! will be back for their signature dishes next time!
and maybe another thing to add on is that some of their drinks in the drinks menu are not available, so it is better to check with the staff!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111024624549107304510/reviews
Leon Lee,3,"This is our first dining experience with this restaurant.

We forgot know of this place when my boy and his friends came to this place to fish for prawns.

The food is tasty but the portion is small, given the price we paid. The fish head curry is probably the better dish of all other 5 dishes we ordered.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117761206852042064232/reviews

Lipsinging Khau,4,"Came with my family of 5 on a Sunday evening which is not very crowded.
Ordered some of their chef recommended dishes like Hakka Fried pork, San Lou Fried Bee Hoon, Green dragon chives.
The Hakka Fried pork is awesome! Crispy on outside, tender on inside. My Dad loved the stir-fried beef horfun with their tender beef slices!
Will definitely come again to try other dishes as well! üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109891903890837324104/reviews
