      "text": "So we visited in December 2018, before Christmas Day. We had been meaning to go for some time and thought there was no time like the ‘present’!\n\nWe arrived first thing in the morning around 9am to miss the crowds. Definitely a good idea as an hour had gone past and there were certainly a larger flood of crowds.\n\nWe visited the following:\n\n1. Cloud Forest Dome\n\n2. Supertree Grove and OCBC Skyway\n\n3. Flower Dome\n\nOur favourite was the Cloud Forest. You enter a temperate climate dome (a cooling break from the usual Singapore equatorial temperatures) and are welcomed by a huuuuge indoor waterfall. You’ll reach the top of the dome and then make your way down via bridges and internal stairs. A lovely variety of flora and fauna to interest both old and young.\n\nThe Supertree Grove and Skyway is what you would normally see on Singapore’s tourist literature. We had to buy a separate ticket for this. A great view from the top of the skyway, looking over the gardens and the iconic Marina Bay Sands. We’d picked a sunny, blue-sky morning to get some great pics, but beware of the heat. Make sure you visit in the morning to escape the crowds. There is a limited number of persons allowed on the Skywalk.\n\nThe Flower Dome is a lovely, open space expanse. It was Christmas time so they had a Tsum Tsum Disney feature. We actually got roped into a YouTube video that day which was quite funny and embarrassing for us. Lots of varieties of plants and very interesting.\n\nCertainly would recommend the Gardens.",
