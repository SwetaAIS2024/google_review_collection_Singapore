As a sgporean who grew up eating chicken rice, i can say it is one of the best tasting, the chicken, sauce and rice. It is probably of the location that is why customers expect a 5 star service. As someone who also grew up with markets, hawkers and food centres, i understand the service provided and have no issues with it. After all, i come to a food centre to expect good affordable delicious food, and not for great service.\n\nThanks for the amazing roasted chicken rice as usual team!",

I would not return purely because of her.\nWhen asked how much a portion of chicken is (without rice), she points at the wordy board and say Prices all stated, look at it yourself - ironically it didn‚Äôt state what I wanted.\n\nWhen I say I want 1 person portion of chicken (only) she asks big or small.\nWhen I say big, she then asks $7 or $8.\nI didn‚Äôt know a 1 person portion then has so many sub categories to choose from.\nWhat is the difference ? She didn‚Äôt answer.\n\nWhen the kind uncle inside asks which part of chicken I want, she shushes him up before I can answer. ‚ÄúJust give anything‚Äù she said to him.",

She collected $4 from me and the next moment she informed me that she left with only ‚Äòji wei‚ÄôÈ∏°Â∞æ.\n\nShe told me it is near the thigh and it will cost $7. I was very hungry so I just go ahead with her suggestion. I gave her another $3, hoping that she didn‚Äôt cheat me.\n\nThe next day, I went back to the hawker centre and realised that chicken drumstick is $5. I wonder where did this $7 come from???\n\nWell, this lady obviously dishonest and has no integrity. Definitely will not patronise this store again! I would love to give them a zero star if Google allows.",
