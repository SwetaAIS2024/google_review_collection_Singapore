John Chan,5,"Very cosy place to have a meal. Had breakfast here. Saw that it has good reviews and dropped by to give it a try. And indeed, food was really nice and tasty. Their waffle has buttery flavour infused within, so it's not like the usual waffle you get at other place. The portion is not small so if you want something light, you could probably try sharing. Would definitely visit again, if there's a chance.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102205353050375159239/reviews

Eagle Dolphin,5,"This spot has a cozy and inviting atmosphere, and it’s easy to find. The place was bustling with people, which is a great sign. We ordered several dishes, and every one of them was exceptional.

The orange espresso soda was a unique and refreshing highlight, while the rosti, timeless waffle, and Cajun spice sando were also superb. Each dish had a distinctive flavor, and you could tell the chef put a lot of care into their preparation. Everything was flavorful and beautifully presented.

The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, even in the busy setting. They managed to provide excellent service without missing a beat.

Overall, it’s highly recommended! I’ll definitely be coming back to enjoy more.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114237464847972975196/reviews
Tiffany Chong,5,"I visited Prairie by Craftsmen this morning, and even though it was a Sunday, it wasn’t too crowded, which was a nice surprise. All the small tables were taken, but they had a shared table available. The staff was really helpful and moved us to a small table as soon as one opened up.

Ordering is done through a QR code, and you pay immediately before they serve the food. I found the service quite fast. I ordered the Dalgona Caramel Latte and the Ajitama & Potato Salad Sando, and the total came to SGD36. The prices felt standard for a café or maybe a bit on the higher side.

The coffee was great—I love sweet drinks, so the Dalgona Caramel Latte was perfect for me. The sandwich was a bit tough to eat; I had to cut the eggs and squeeze it together a little, but it looked great for photos!

The environment was cozy, and my friend and I stayed for a long chat. It was really enjoyable, and the bus stop right in front of the café made it super convenient to get there. Overall, 5 stars!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117586519413784657518/reviews
Lucinda Goh,5,"I had an amazing time at this bakery. I was served by a kind and pretty lady Ms Zara, and was very impressed by her service. She had a radiant smile that warmed up the entire establishment. It is very cosy and quaint. The crossaint was very puffy, its pastry was light and delicious. Would definitely recommend this bakery :)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100345348375281617162/reviews
