Harry HM,5,"I love having dinner here! This place is like a premier hawker center.
Personally, I prefer to eat indoors always.
In that sense, this place is good for me while providing multiple food options.
I've tried the Thai, Vietnamese, and Burger shops. All of them were excellent. The prices are reasonable, and the environment is clean and cool.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100734485268663931371/reviews
