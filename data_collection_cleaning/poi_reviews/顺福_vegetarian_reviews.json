Can you imagine the owner cooking an entire plate of mock meat char siew, 烧肉, mutton, prawn, duck meat, fry potatoes and pumpkin without any seasoning? (see photo) I visited for three days, and every day the dishes looked the same. Some dishes even seemed like they had been left overnight. I did try to inform the owner about it, but he simply ignored my concerns. I hope this stall can find a new owner soon.",
