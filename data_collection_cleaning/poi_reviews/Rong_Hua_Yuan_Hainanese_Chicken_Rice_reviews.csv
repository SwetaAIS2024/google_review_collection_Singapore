Sean Goh,3,"New chicken rice stall that opened for business recently at 58 marketplace food centre. Decided to have chicken rice since there were barely any stalls operating around late afternoon. Price starts from SGD$3 onwards.

Ordered the roasted chicken since it was the only available choice. Completed my meal with a braised egg and this meal sets me SGD$3.70. Portion is pretty huge, and the rice was nicely cooked, however it lack the fragrance. Apart from the cucumber, they also value add by serving salted veg by the side. Chilli has the right level of spiciness. The breast meat wasnt tough nor dry.

Overall, its a decent plate of chicken rice that i wouldnt mind eating again.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Andrew Quek,3,"An average chicken rice stall. Rice, chilli and soup is just ok.

White breast meat is dry though. $4 while its competitors are selling at $3.50.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107293216878513408070/reviews
George Teo,1,"After staying just opposite for 18 years, this is the first time I am eating from the stall. There was once 7 chicken rice stalls among the 5 coffeeshops and a hawker centre. With plenty to choose from, my favorite is the coffeeshop facing the road. Once when they told me off after my regular order of 2 chicken wings and liver, I never patronised them again. This same stall was featured an angry customer threw the chicken at the vendor.
Back to this stall, I just feel like eating poached chicken and so decided to try this stall. But disappointment soon came after tasting the rice. It was bland and tasteless. The same goes to the chicken. Won't patronise this stall again I was too hungry so finish the rice even tasteless.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116934309180688670454/reviews
