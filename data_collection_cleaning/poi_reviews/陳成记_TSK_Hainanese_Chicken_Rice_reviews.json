Can't comment on wanton noodles because I didn't have that. Price has gone up in hawker centres and coffee shops but this stall is able to keep it at $3.50 for a plate of chicken rice. Stallholder is friendly. Will definitely be back to have more.\n\nThe coffee shop didn't separate the smokers' corner, it was smokey when we were there.",
