      "text": "This is my first visit to a Kei Kasendon branch, and I must say that if all branches serve food like this one, I will be a regular customer :)\n\nI ordered the Anago Unagi Don set, and was pleasantly surprised. I've not had Anago before, it's flavour was milder than Unagi, probably because of the way it's seasoned/sauced, and it was fresh, no 'fishy' taste at all. Together with the more heavily sauced Unagi, it provided a good balance to the dish. I loved the tamago included with the 2 eels too. Highly recommended.\n\nMy wife and son ordered the signature Kaisendon, and they were not disappointed as well. Fresh, flavourful kaisen served with good quality Japanese rice. 美味しい!\n\nMy daughter doesn't really like fish, so she ordered the Yakitori Undon set. That was just average. I guess it's understandable cos that's not their specialty.\n\nOverall, we recommend this place, and will definitely visit again :)",
