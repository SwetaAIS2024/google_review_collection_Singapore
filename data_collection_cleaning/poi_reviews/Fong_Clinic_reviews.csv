Test ty,5,"Great experience and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking medical care in the area. The physician, Dr. Fong, was accommodating and puts the patient first, which I appreciated. He was also very attentive and showed great consideration towards my opinions and concerns. Service was good and the price was very affordable for a general practitioner.
