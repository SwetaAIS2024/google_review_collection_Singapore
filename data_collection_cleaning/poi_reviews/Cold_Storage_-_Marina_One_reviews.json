Your customer will never return when there are better value options around. Even CS’s own fresh meat is far better value. Also the chicken does not taste fresh. You cut corners so much then people will notice and leave you!",

Fruits and vegetables are often old. Mold is frequently observed in fruits. Yoghurt that is supposed to expire in 2 months is watery and grainy.\n\nStaff still overlooks the quality when stocking the shelves despite numerous feedback. I will not visit unless it is an emergency.",
