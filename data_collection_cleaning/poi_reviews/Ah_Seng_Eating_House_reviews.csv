Lionel Wong,3,"Used to come here for breakfast. Usually order the economical beehoon. The Kway Teow is very oily and taste of MSG. The Kopi and Teh Si is good though. Personal favorite is the Mee Siam but it is seldom ready when I am there for breakfast. The payment and receiving change for the drinks is ""self-service"", unless you are paying with $10 and above.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106065208953751619577/reviews

Raymond Seah,4,"Normally, there for breakfast. They have a reasonable variety of tasty food.

The owner is a friendly and honest guy. When my wife ordered the char siew bun, he was frank with her; that it was just delivered and is not hot enough.  He has a lot of regulars... hear him conversing jokingly with one of the lady customer... calling her ""dear"" and she responded jovially as well.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103601077183393324234/reviews
