Z a,5,"Wonderful neighbourhood eatery, the china staff is excellent at preparing multiple orders properly. However gotta minus points for the cleanliness and flies going from table to table.

BCM: $4.50
Kopi ice: $1.50
Total 7 bucks quite a fair price
free flow condiments such as fried onions and spring onions at counter",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117692337958249056078/reviews
Don Ng (DonDon),5,"2nd meal tried their Bak Chor Mee.
Cooked by assistant, decent meal filling but I rank the laksa a lot higher.

For those that enjoy local coffee, get a cup of kopi o Kosong. $1.20, good taste the owner did not skimp in getting quality coffee bean powder.

When u drink coffee without the sugar and milk, u can taste the quality and this is one of the best I have tasted.

Plus it accepts CDC and u don't need to clear your bowls.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104578135546419099926/reviews
Jay Sng,5,Super underrated understated place that serves awesome Bak Chor Mee and others. The portions are really generous and the chilli oomph! Soup broth is great too for soup dishes. First time in years I can get full after eating noodles. Must support ok? The chef is from China. Honest hardworking young man who took over the local owner after the owner left. He is really kind hearted and generous. Please patronize this place. Loving every visit especially after I return from overseas and I miss my BCM.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107218241116967128027/reviews
M Hu,5,"$4.50 a decent portion of BCM. With a good portion of ingredients. The noodles is very chewy and not nua nua. Service is very good and kind friendly. Idk why people would complain the food here not nice. $5 for the 8 pcs guo tie, okay la, freshly cooked. And the fried fish $2 also decent. Will come back here for comfort food",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105194999046987513257/reviews
William Lu,5,"Portion was good for the price. I liked the signature noodle, a bit soggy to bring back home but it was alright, it would have been better to eat there directly.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
