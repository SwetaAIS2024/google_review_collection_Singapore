Jervis Ng,5,"My partner and I dined at Monti Singapore yesterday and had the best service we’ve ever experienced. We were served by Ana and her team, who were not only professional and attentive but also wonderfully personable. They were warm, engaging, and didn’t hesitate to share light-hearted jokes while introducing each dish, which made the experience all the more enjoyable.

The table service was exceptional from start to finish, and the food was just as impressive. Every dish was beautifully prepared, with the standout for us being the risotto — marked with a chef’s hat, and rightfully so as their signature dish. We left thoroughly satisfied and would highly recommend Monti to anyone looking for a place with both outstanding food and top-tier service.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101096524152423102335/reviews

The view was absolutely stunning — you get a clear look at Marina Bay and other iconic Singapore landmarks, which made the evening feel extra special. The set menu dishes were well thought out, beautifully presented, and tasted fantastic. Service was professional, attentive, and made us feel welcomed throughout. Highly recommended for a special night out.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114065293574498191443/reviews
Paries Liew,5,"We’ve returned to this restaurant a few times now, and it never disappoints. Food portions are generous, and the overall dining experience is consistently excellent. The pork collar was a little too salty to our taste, but everything else was delicious.

I’d like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Ganesh for the wonderful service during our meal. From the moment we were seated, he was attentive, courteous, and genuinely kind. He anticipated our needs without being intrusive and made sure we were comfortable throughout. His warm smile and thoughtful attitude truly elevated our dining experience. Thank you for making our visit memorable — your professionalism and care did not go unnoticed!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112468047680415922745/reviews
David Tan,5,"Ordered the roasted gilmar octopus($38),
Pumpkin tortelli ($38), USA prime ribeye “Tagliata” style($76). Dessert is monti’s molten pistachio tiramisu ($25).
Also ordered some cocktails like Hugo, Mr Monti, mint nocciola.

Been to many Italian restaurants and u know their dishes and taste are somewhat similar.
But food at Monti thrown us off, in an astounding way.
The ribeye is so tender and juicy, yet not too rare, and not salty. So you can savour the texture and taste of the beef with every chew.
Pumpkin tortelli is also a wonderful dish but the portion is kinda too little. It has some sauce/dressing and when you bite thru the tortelli, the pumpkin and sauces mixed together, it really make you want for more.

Overall it’s a wonderful dining experience.
And superb service by all the staff. Special thanks to Raju for the excellent service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103430527892808066537/reviews
Shannon Lee,3,"Wait staff Ana served us very well, her friendly smile made us feel comfortable and welcomed.

Truffle focaccia was excellent as always, and the mocktails were perfectly refreshing. We also enjoyed the burratina with fresh and sweet cherry tomatoes.

However, the mushroom soup and black cod felt lacking in flavour. The cod had an unusual pairing with beans and apricot which we couldn't appreciate.

Lastly, we had mixed feeling about the ribeye steak, which was cooked perfectly and tested amazing, somewhat to our surprise as the presentation wasn't visually exciting but rather dark and uninteresting. While the mushroom and potato tasted good, the entire dish started feeling too salty and heavy towards the end.

Overall, some of the dishes were good, some quite disappointing, but didn’t feel worth the hefty price point. I would say you’re mainly paying for the atmosphere, the food is kind of hit or miss.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106108531235778292040/reviews
