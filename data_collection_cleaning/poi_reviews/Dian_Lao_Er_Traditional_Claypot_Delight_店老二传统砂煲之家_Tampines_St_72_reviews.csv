Evie Chua,2,"The claypot rice is definitely NOT 4.1*.
I ordered set A which comes with x1 chicken lupcheong and x1 spinach minced meatball soup.

For the rice, aroma and taate is really is so so/ average only. Just an neighbourhood claypot place to satisfy your hunger but not cravings.
The spinach is bitter and meatball has frozen meat taste.

I really wouldnt visit again.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115344937967817245653/reviews
yasmin heyu,4,"went there for dinner, food not bad. we had set c i think.  the chicken claypot rice could definitely be more flavourful & the sesame chicken wasn’t really fragrant (though it tasted ok). spinach soup also wasn’t too flavourful or fragrant, tasted mediocre & the minced pork balls were not really well marinated i feel. overall food was average, would only comeback if i’m really craving claypot chicken rice and there’s no other options.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109862344718874464029/reviews

Chong kah lok,1,Order twice and get canceled twice from foodpanda! If you have to cancel everytime better not put in the app in the first place! High volume then cancel? so what? It’s dinner time and ppl eat at this timing of course will be high volume. Just close yourself in the app next time rather than waste ppl time to order and wait then got cancelled in the end,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104153783787123509233/reviews
Kaiishaa,4,"Been here a few times. Delicious claypot rice around the neighborhood coffeeshop. Chicken cubes served are very tender and flavourful.
However, I felt the consistency of the food can be better (e.g the amount of dark sauce added sometimes was too much that it spoils the taste of the entire claypot chicken rice)
I would recommend the braised pig's trotter and ofc the claypot chicken rice if you are here!
Service and pricing wise is okay, definitely will come back if I'm craving for some claypot!

Overall 4/5",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116908195414013818410/reviews
