People with bigger appetites may find the portion small. It also came with a drink and Monster Hunter collab items.\n\nAtmosphere was good too, as there were Monster Hunter decor throughout the entire place. Can't say for sure when the event is over.",

      "text": "Went to the Japan Rail Cafe for the Monster Hunter collab, enjoyed the decor and ambience of the place - cute cozy cafe with outside seating. Very cold aircon though.\n\nThe collab menu was $18 for meal and drink which is outrageous considering the portion size was TINY. My partner ordered the Pork Shogayaki don and I ordered the Kaisen don along with the Beauty Tea and Citrus Green tea. Fortunately, the food was tasty and seasoned but $18 for a tiny portion of meat and rice is crazy. The drinks were subpar.\n\nFor some reason, fried food would've taken an hour to prepare which was quite disappointing. We dined in at 3pm midday so we had expected to not have any issues because we wanted to try the Chicken Namban don.\n\nThe coasters and placemats were cute at least. Coasters were made of good quality and the placemats were just normal printed glossy paper.\n\nOverall, we paid $46 for 2 tiny meals and 2 bland drinks. Moving forward, I will not be going out of my way to return here as there are other Japanese restaurants nearby with better portions.",

      "text": "They recently started adding back burgers into their menu, so I decided to check it out.\n\nChicken Katsu burger was large and juicy, very satisfying to eat! Could use a bit more onion rings, but overall worth the price tag.\n\nThe Sakura yakult ice cream shake that came with the meal was also really good, creamy but not too sweet. Will come back to try the other hamburger soon!",
