Tian Wen Lim,3,"Has more equipment than the newer nearby SRC gym, recommended if you prefer heavier weights.

Had lots of space and equipment to myself since the area is a little old and out of the way, so it's not that popular. Been told that the sports teams might crowd out the gym during semester, but i havent encountered it myself.

Side note: Hoping the walls get a fresh coat of paint. It's a pukey shade of yellow currently.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101551554118261799390/reviews
