The soft boiled eggs were great, kaya butter toast was crunchy on the outside. Price was reasonable as well. Iâ€™d come again for another simple meal.",

Portion is good & surprised have a serving of cabbage too! Egg is nice & chicken wing slightly dry. Teh is just right in sweetness. Overall is quite good value.",

The food were all on the sweet side which was a bit odd since they were savoury items. Coffee was rather weak, disappointed since it looked dark.\n\nCafe was clean, service staff was friendly.",
