Jenny NYL,5,"Doctor Nadya was gentle, patience and detailed with her consultation. She advised me on the pros and cons of my tooth extraction procedure, she did not rush me to make decision. She was professional and managed to extract my modular tooth through regular extraction instead of the complication surgery process. The front desk lady (Alexis) was also approachable, friendly and kind. Overall, I had an wonderful and pleasurable experience with Teeth Q. I had decided to switch over to consult Teeth Q instead of my previous dental who had charged me double of the price with painful extraction.
Happy Customer.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100202797015117111365/reviews
