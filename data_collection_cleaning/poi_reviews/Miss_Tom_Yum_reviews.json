      "text": "Food:\nGreen curry $12.90: it's quite flavourful yet not to spicy. It's good for those that like green curry but aren't good with spice. Sizewise it's just nice for 1 person. Wished they added more chicken and less mushroom and also if the Thai basil was cut into strips and instead just left whole as it really is annoying to remove it while eating 3/5\n\nBasil chicken rice $7.90: Chicken is very flavourful and tasty about. The portion given was fair for 7.90. comes with free small milk tea. 5/5\n\nService: food came out decently fast but granted I went when no one was ard\n\nAtmosphere: It's chill",
