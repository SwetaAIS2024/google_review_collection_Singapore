      "text": "For someone who usually does not like vegetarian food, this place comes as a pleasant surprise when I brought my vegetarian mum here. Humbly located at the corner of an industrial estate (but visible and easily accessible to the public transport from just outside the road), this place serves a huge variety of food items. Other than the regular Northern (paneer, poori, Chapatti) and Southern Indian food (briyani, prata, dosai, mutarbak), it also serves western food (burger, pasta, pizza) and local food (char kway teow, fried bee hoon, nasi lemak, etc). The kids love the cheese burger and fries. Salad is refreshing!\n\nWill certainly come back again to try the pasta and pizza and many more other items on the menu, which I failed to share here.",
