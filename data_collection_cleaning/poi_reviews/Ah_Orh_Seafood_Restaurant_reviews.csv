AC Chan,5,"My family’s favourite dish comprises of 5 items including prawn roll, jellyfish, chilled jelly pork, salad prawn & money bag dumpling. I used to eat this dish growing up in the 1980s but it is not commonly found on zi char restaurants’ menus these days. I always order this traditional dish when we visit Ah Orh as it triggers old memories and a taste of nostalgia.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Kevin (AussieFoodieAdventures),4,"I’ll start this review by raving about the dessert. The Orh Nee (Yam Paste) was heavenly. Smooth texture, sinfully tasty and truly the best way to complete a hearty meal. Both the Kuay Teow and Mian Xian noodles had that incredible and unmistakable charred flavor. Every mouthful was satisfying. The oyster omelette was very tasty and topped with a generous serving of plump oysters. The egg was fried to perfection, crisp and yet soft and fluffy on the inside. My least favorite was the fish maw soup. The soup was a little too starchy for my liking.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107203837341723663240/reviews
Catherine Tan,4,"Came here for a CNY dinner. The lohei was good despite the abalones being so tiny. Delectable dishes include steamed pomfret, Teochew style, steamed prawns, oyster omelette, herbal chicken, and spinach with shitake mushrooms and abalones. 2 dishes weren't memorable: orh nee and fish maw soup. Orh nee was just so-so, no pumpkin added too. Fish maw soup was kinda watery. I have had other fish maw soups that have more ingredients than this (this one only has fish maw and nothing else). I say skip these 2 dishes and the rest of your meal would be fine.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108571598741145831471/reviews
