Starr Davis,5,"Love this indoor shopping mall. It has multiple levels and offers so much of variety of shopping, food and more. Very spacious, open and clean. People here are friendly as well.

There are many small vendors as soon as you enter the mall at the first level. I can‚Äôt always find handcrafted unique items in the section.

Of course, our favorite level is were filled with variety of restaurants and delicious cuisines . The food court which is what Americans call it is huge. So much variety of foods are offered here and has a fun grab machine with arcade too.

Pricing throughout the mall are very, but majority are very reasonable . Grab pick up is convenient by one of the main entrance.
Highly recommend.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102462395253586989773/reviews

Michael W.,4,"Orchardgateway is one of the many shopping malls on Orchard Road. The shopping mall was bustling when we were there on the weekend. All the restaurants and shops have many customers. Some have a line waiting at the front. However, the restrooms are still very clean even though many people use them in the shopping mall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100650347987392581241/reviews
