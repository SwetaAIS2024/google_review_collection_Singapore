Kimberley Howarth,5,"I came across this wonderful Korean specialty supermarket and I am really impressed! They trully have such a wide variety of specialty Korean products. And an entire fridge full of various different pickles and kimchi! Really need to take your time to browse. The supermarket is clean and well organised, and shopping here is comfortable. The staff seems to be foreign but he was courteous and had a smile. If you love Korean products you should come and spend some time looking thru here. Really great and unique stuff that you can't find in any other supermarkets",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957590885643931784/reviews
Vivian Eng,3,"Clean environment, consider lots of variety of Korean things
But the price is too pricy consider you can get 70% cheaper from onlineðŸ¤”
For eg, the spam luncheon meat can get it around RM8-10+ on online platforms but here if Iâ€™m not wrong it sells around RM20 for one?
The price for instant noodles and rice is also higher than AeonðŸ¤”

All is over pricey but can understand as due to shop need to settle worker fees , maintenance fee and shop rent so onðŸ¤”

Targeted customer might more on be overseas people.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114391499141226612365/reviews
Ayisha Basari,1,"Really cannot take picture of the mart, i was tried to promote to all my firends since they love korean products.
But the cashier was shouting & not allowed me to do so. Too bad for marketing.he can come and tell me nicely, perhaps
Well no wonder, no one in the shop.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110636887977096857745/reviews

22LR,2,"The place is so so. The goods are very expensive and there is only one staff there. As i saw, he had a neck something and is just on a call as he is working. No comment here, the store is ok if you are rich.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115896141034540831883/reviews
