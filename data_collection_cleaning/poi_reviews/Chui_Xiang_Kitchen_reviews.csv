Marshall Ho,5,"A Pleasant Surprise – Great Food & Service!

I hadn’t originally planned to dine at this Chinese restaurant, but after being ignored at the Japanese restaurant next door, I decided to give this place a try—and I’m so glad I did!

From the moment I walked in, the service staff was attentive and welcoming. The food arrived quickly, with generous portions and excellent flavors. Every dish was well-prepared, making for a truly satisfying meal.

The only downside is the noise level, likely due to the low ceiling. However, that didn’t take away from the overall experience. I’ll definitely be back to try more dishes!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114608543636534555173/reviews
S Wun,5,"April 2024: visited this first time after a walk at the nearby park area. Delicious and reasonably priced. Had the best seller beef with Kailan as well as the seafood fried  noodles. The seafood fried noodles had wok kei and was very tasty.

April 2024: Another visit the same week! We had marmite pork ribs and it was tender and tasty! Must try.

July 2024: yet another visit and tried more dishes. This would soon be our go to Zi char. Good portions and delicious.

Oct 2024: dinner again and though it was full house, they managed to squeeze us in. Quick service but slow food quality. Nice. Fish slices were thick and portions generous.

Dec 2024: another quick dinner visit and tried dishes new to us - long beans. Delicious. Their dishes never fails on taste and speed to table. Piping hot and perfectly executed.

Jan 2025: tried more dishes today. As usual not disappointed as the dishes were all very good.

March 2025: we tried a new dish - scrambled egg with crabmeat. V nice and yummy.

April 2025: another visit for simple dinner",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110012229164046535881/reviews
Beary Beary,5,"Air Con “Zi Char”

Basically this place is an air-conditioned zi char place. In the heat of noon, you can have all the usual dishes without any sweat.

Food was pretty good and generous. There was food to take away after the meal. Food is served piping hot and attendants were attentive and friendly.

The decor and set up was basic but the winning factor is the air-conditioning. There is parking beside the building and in front of the restaurant if you are lucky enough to get it.

Overall, this is a convenient place for a meal especially for families who drive.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101788329090998743221/reviews
Wang Huiyuan,4,"Recommended to try their cooking style. Ordered take away. Nonya fish,  tofu with enoki mushroom, broccoli,  shrimp paste chicken wings.  Satisfied with their standard. The nonya paste fish was nicely done,  little spicy and sour.  Fish was fresh.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108141325047941728078/reviews
Haz T,3,"Food is average. The 干炒牛河 is in fact way teow and can’t really see the beef slices. Marmite ribs were tender but a bit too sweet , in my family’s opinion. They kept asking me “is this really marmite ribs?” Portions are quite sizeable though. Oyster omelette is not worth it. Expensive and not too tasty.

Total bill is higher than Tze char after adding service charge and gst. We ordered a takeaway item and that was still charged for svc charge and a takeaway box for 30c?! That included an added service charge fee?",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116070620477048278312/reviews
