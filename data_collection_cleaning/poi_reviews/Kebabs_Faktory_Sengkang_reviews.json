The bowl i suggest should be eaten fresh and not take away. In all really enjoyed the wraps as well as the falafel and the sauce with falafel.",

The baklava, despite selling at 2 for $5.90, is incredibly small & full of oil & sugar (could've spent that $5.90 on 2 plates of chicken rice). The salads are nice & worth the portion though.",

      "text": "0 star for customer service. I recently visited Kebab's Factory at SengKang Grand Mall and had a disappointing experience with the customer service. The staff member who took my order seemed rude and unfriendly. When I ordered the signature bowl, she asked me to specify the options in an abrupt tone. I felt that a more polite approach would have been to explain the available options. Additionally, when I asked for clarification on the price, there seemed to be a lack of clarity.\nThe staff member also didn't include the bill in the takeaway cover. However, I was fortunate to have another staff member intervene and assist me in a kind and helpful manner.Unfortunately, the staff member, an elderly woman, was extremely rude, warranting a 0-star review. I hope management takes this feedback seriously and addresses the issue to improve customer service.",
