Hao Tan,4,"Glad to know they are back in business after the committee centre renovation.  The newly renovated restaurant was spacious, trendy and clean. We visited on a weekday morning,  restaurant was rather empty. The foods were served in reasonable time and the staffs were friendly.  Good to visit. Car parking available at the HDB neighbourhood next to the committee centre.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117487638688399238932/reviews
Chris Tan,4,"A newly spruced up BK outlet after many months of renovations! It’s situated on the ground floor of Tampines North Community Centre and boasts a new, big and inviting space for dine-in. Typical fast food fare but it’s a nice space to hang out in. And oh, it’s open 24 hours so great for late night hangs!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103463791737805347871/reviews
M L,5,"During my visit, the team worked seamlessly, which is a reflection of effective management. The staff was friendly, the service was prompt, and the restaurant was clean and well-organized. It's clear that the manager (Fatimah) prioritizes both customer satisfaction and staff morale, creating a welcoming environment. Keep up the great work!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112413722222987066651/reviews
Steven Lai,1,"Ordered 3 x fish burger value meals (take away) which comes with 3 sets of 3 nuggets, but when reached home and opened up the take away package only realized only got 1 set of 3 nuggets.
Very disappointed with BK as I trusted them to place whatever should be inside the packaging.
So next time whoever got buy take away, pls remember to check whatever should be insiders the packaging before leaving BK TNCC.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117853452004741533102/reviews
