Yesmine Boukhili,5,"My Singaporean friend introduced me to Leng Heng B.B.Q. & Claypot Deluxe at East Coast Lagoon Food Village for their renowned chili crab. It turned out to be the culinary highlight of my stay in Singapore. The authenticity of the experience, coupled with the rich and vibrant flavors of the chili crab, created a dining experience beyond words. Set in the relaxed atmosphere of East Coast Lagoon Food Village, it's a must-visit for those wanting an exceptional and genuine taste of this iconic dish.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105580828895952991057/reviews
