Yun Hin Ong,1,"Tried to call pharmacy to enquire on medication balance, no one picked up. Waited to collect medication for over an hour and staff at registration counter told me waiting time 90 mins. Somehow after I enquired, my Q# was called minutes later. Go figure. When I want to pay online, they said I need to pay up before I leave the pharmacy. Previously, I do not have issue when I opt to pay online when visiting specialist.

That sums up the efficiency of a Singapore public hospital and the trust that placed on patient !!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105433796736978979837/reviews

Fong G.H,1,It is time the system need to be upgraded to shorten waiting time . Patient should be able to get their medicine upon checking from Doctor consultation and no more registration required. It is a waste of time and also tiring for an elderly patient who have to wait and sit on their wheelchair unable to have proper rest. Wasted almost 10 min registering and waited more than an hour and no is still not called.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102843754260486619893/reviews
