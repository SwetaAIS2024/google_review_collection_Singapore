TAHA MUHAMED,1,"Poor after sale service. The 1st yr , the Heavetech timber colour faded. Charged $200 for re-coating. 3rd yr, timber got rotten. Ask for replacement, want to charge $700 to change 3 set of wood. When ask, if i can purchase the timber and i fix it myself, no timber available. Go to the company at Kaki Bukit, company closed. Check with the neighbouring units, informed the company hv close down for months.  A none reliable company.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104352458678296684027/reviews
