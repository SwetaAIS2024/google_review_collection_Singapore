      "text": "I highly recommend Dr. Kausar based on my positive experience. I had never had a root canal treatment before, and I wasn‚Äôt sure where the pain was coming from, as I had no visible decay. However, Dr. Kausar quickly identified the issue with her expertise.\n\nI underwent the root canal procedure on October 29th, and I was quite nervous beforehand. To my surprise, the entire process was painless until the very end. I returned for a follow-up today, and everything is healing perfectly.\n\nThe team of staff are also incredibly friendly and provide excellent service, which made the entire experience even better. If you're considering a root canal, Dr. Kausar is the one to go to. She is professional, skilled, and truly makes you feel at ease. You‚Äôll be in great hands!",
