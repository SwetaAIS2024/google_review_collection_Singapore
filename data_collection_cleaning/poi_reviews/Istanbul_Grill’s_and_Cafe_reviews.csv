Had an amazing dining experience at Istanbul Grill’s & Cafe!
We came in with no expectations and left absolutely satisfied.

The food was rich in flavour, well-seasoned, and beautifully presented.

The ambiance was cozy, service was warm, and the overall vibe made us feel right at home. A perfect spot whether you’re dining with friends or family.

Even though the prices are on the higher end, the quality of the food and ingredients really shines throug",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112049648766999097314/reviews
Jonas Ng,2,"The food was okay, nothing special at all. The sauce they put in doesn’t complement well especially the red sauce that looks and tasted like a salsa which is weird because it’s supposed to be a Turkish dish not Mexican. Definitely not authentic shawarma! The baklava is decent.
Service was quite confusing in a way that you don’t know who is really the server.
Not the best place to go if looking for good shawarma and pricing is also ex considering the food and service they serve.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101879101765488803530/reviews

Zamri S.,5,"Istanbul Grill’s is more than just your typical grill spot — it’s a flavorful journey. The seasoning in every dish really stands out, elevating the experience beyond the norm. The food was excellent, especially the Lamb Pide, Testi Kebab, and Sigara Boregi — each dish rich in taste and cooked to perfection.

The ambience was warm and welcoming, with ample space that makes it ideal for larger groups or gatherings. Whether you’re out with friends or planning a small celebration, the setting fits just right.

Overall, Istanbul Grill’s delivers on all fronts — delicious food, great atmosphere, and solid service. Definitely worth a visit!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106417231234138498022/reviews
