      "text": "Tried June Coffee and walked away pretty satisfied‚Äîespecially with the drinks. They‚Äôre definitely the strong point here. That said, be prepared for a wait. We waited around an hour for a table on a Sunday afternoon as they don‚Äôt take reservations.\n\nOverall Drinks Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nStrawberry Matcha Latte: 10/10 ‚Äì Perfect balance and refreshing. A must-try.\n\nBlack Sesame Latte: 8/10 ‚Äì Rich and nutty.\n\nKinako Matcha Latte: 9/10 ‚Äì The saltiness pairs surprisingly well with the bitterness of the matcha.\n\nOverall Food Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nMiso Carbonara: 7/10 ‚Äì A very light miso flavor. Not quite sure what the hype is about; tastes like a slightly salted basic carbonara.\n\nEggo Mayo Toast: 8/10 ‚Äì The highlight of the food menu. Not too eggy or greasy‚Äîjust a really good balance.\n\nCrab Linguine: 8/10 ‚Äì Nicely cooked pasta with a light crab flavor. The sauce is subtle and not overly creamy, which keeps the dish from feeling too heavy. Not intensely seafood-forward, but still enjoyable and well-balanced.\n\nTater Tots: 8/10 ‚Äì A dish that‚Äôs hard to go wrong with, though the portion is a bit small.\n\nOverall, it‚Äôs a great place for drinks and a decent bite. I‚Äôd come back for the drinks alone.",
