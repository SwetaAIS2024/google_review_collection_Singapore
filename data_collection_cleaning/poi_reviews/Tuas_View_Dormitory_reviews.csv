Prakash nadar,1,"I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding an incident that occurred. I parked my vehicle for approximately five minutes in a season parking lot, unaware that it was a restricted area. Despite the short duration, my vehicle was clamped, and I was required to pay a fine of S$109 to have it released.

I believe this action was excessive and unfair, as there were no clear warnings or allowances for brief stops. Additionally, when I attempted to explain the situation to the enforcement personnel, my concerns were disregarded.

I kindly request a review of this matter and, if possible, a refund or reconsideration of the penalty. I have attached relevant photos, receipts, and details of the incident for your reference.

Please let me know the next steps in resolving this issue. I look forward to your prompt response.ðŸ˜­",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105497980505927490853/reviews
