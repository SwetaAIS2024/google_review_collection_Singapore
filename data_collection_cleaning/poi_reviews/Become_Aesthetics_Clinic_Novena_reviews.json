Each session is about 5 minutes, which seemed rushed.\n\nInitially, I was told that 3-5 sessions would be sufficient to remove the pigmentation before signing up the package. However, when I shared my concerns and disappointment with the clinic, they pushed me to sign up for more packages instead of addressing my concerns. They claimed that they never promised removal in less than 6 sessions, which I found misleading.\n\nI wish they would review their previous communication, such as our WhatsApp messages, to recall their initial promises.\n\nDisappointed with this clinic.",
