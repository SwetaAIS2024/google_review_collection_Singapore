That's Amazing.\nüê¶During weekends, members of the Kebun Bahru Bird Singing Club, mostly seniors, gathered here with their caged birds to display them, listen to their calls, appreciating, evaluating and comparing with others around them.\nüê¶üê¶‚Äç‚¨õThe entire area explodes into a concert of bird singing serenade.\nü¶Öüê¶ü¶úThe birds are mostly Chinese hwamei, red-whiskered bulbul, Indian white-eyes and white-rumped shamas.\nVery lively, very mesmerising.\nüêßAt scheduled periods, the Club organise Bird Singing Competitions.\nüê¶‚Äç‚¨õSadly, this once popular hobby had lose it shine with younger folks.\nü¶ÖWhen we loose this heritage, we loose a part of our cultural legacy.\nü™∂Fun facts:\nIn 2018, songbird rearing was designated as Intangible Cultural Heritage by Singapore's National Heritage Board.",
