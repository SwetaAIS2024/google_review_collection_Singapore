Shinderella,5,"Blk 145 Coffeeshop on the side nearer to the wet market there is a nameless rojak stall hidden behind the coffeeshop drink stall. An old grandma with very short white hair is operating it.

I had zero expectations since it was a nameless shop.  I had a very simple looking plate of rojak but I was wrong.  This must be one of the best tasting rojak I had in the area!  The additional asam sauce in the rojak, that sourness really clears down your palate after a heavy meal.  Ingredients are very fresh! The youtiao and cuttlefish are freshly grilled for you totally delicious.  Very good as a filler dessert especially if you are still not full after a meal.  Very refreshing.  You can have the same ingredients for rojak everywhere but to make good rojak need skills. Grandma got skills :D A hidden gem indeed.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110386082675308109452/reviews
