I ordered the cereal chicken fried rice and the cereal with chicken portion was generous, just enough for one persons fill. My colleagues also had other different orders such as the Thai style chicken fried rice, and they had the same good experience. I have yet to visit the stall and I'm sure it will be better. Would definitely buy again when Im looking for something to eat! 5/5 üëçüëç",

Very disappointed with this outlet. Increase price by more than 10% and given such a tiny portion. Take ur money to Ming Kitchen beside which serves better food and portion.",
