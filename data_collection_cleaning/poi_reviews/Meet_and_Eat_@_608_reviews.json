And I would say a big improvement from the previous operator, with newly renovated spaces, tables and chairs. It's brighter and better ventilated. The food stall mix is quite good as well, catering to different taste buds and preferences.\nPersonally I would recommend everyone to check out the nasi lemak stall, porridge stall and the vegetarian stall. Nice place for a meal if you stay near, with lots of parking available behind.",

      "text": "Fairly new coffee shop, and there are many stalls here that hearsay are popular franchise.\n\nWe had their Tzechar at a stall called 海鲜小厨 \"Seafood Kitchen\" for dinner.\n\nService is rather quick, and Asam Fish is pretty good, but lack of gravy. The tofu with minced meat, as well as Cai Po egg, is delicious and flavourful too. The others are pretty mediocre dishes that are not worthy of mention.\n\nWould come back to this coffee shop to try other stalls next time. Western stall looks good.",

My family tried the western food (truffle ham and mushroom baked rice), signature porridge, fish soup, and nasi lemak. Food is good and quite large portion. My teh o peng came in a huge cup! No wonder charge me $2.10. Would have preferred a smaller cup and cheaper as I couldn't finish it.",

Excellent vibe, great variety with chicken rice, caifan, vegetarian, Indian Muslim food, famous Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang, claypot porridge, fishball noodles. Easy parking in open air HDB carpark behind. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area.",
