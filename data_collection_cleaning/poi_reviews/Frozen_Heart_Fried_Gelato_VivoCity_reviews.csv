Caren Kang,5,"The fried bread and ice cream combo is perfect. Tried vanilla, mango passion fruit and sea salt + peanut. All flavors hit the spot,   but vanilla gave the best results together with the fruit spread (yum!) and toppings. The honey pearls are a must! Will totally come again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117754085997728549472/reviews

Charles Goh,5,"Really tasty combination of crisp yet fluffy fried bread and yummy Gelato! We had a bunch of different flavors which were all good. The durian ice cream was pretty good, but we also liked classic flavors like chocolate, vanilla and mint chocolate.

Friendly and quick service too!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100962611140580591006/reviews

Fried ice cream used to be my favorite chinese dessert at Ban Heng but they don’t have it anymore 😤😭 so i was so happy that frozen heart offers it in Singapore from Taiwan! tried the one at Jewel but Vivocity is even better with more flavors and toppings! highly recommend the honey pearls so so sweet and chewy good!🥰💕 For gelato, the mint chocolate and oreo really goes damn well 😍💯 For the price, it’s really quite reasonable since ban heng was selling it at $10 (i clearly remember cos i really love it and that’s before covid) so yes give it a try guys!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110396514254810116452/reviews
Alessandra Nutter,5,"My kids enjoy this a fair bit after we tried it a while ago. It is now a must go when we visit VIVOCITY.

I didn’t care for trying it but I was glad I gave it a shot, the bread is particularly unassuming but it was really a pleasant surprise.
We ordered the Mint chocolate, strawberry and vanilla and enjoyed them all thoroughly.

The service from the Uncle was stellar and he was patient with the kids! Go visit if you haven’t!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108956510832674651199/reviews
