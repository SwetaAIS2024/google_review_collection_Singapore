Gilbert Darmawan,5,"The staffs are teenagers or young adults and sometimes can be a bit blur or slow in taking orders and giving out ready foods. Coordination between the staff at the counter and the staffs cooking / preparing the foods can be much better to minimize double and triple checking the orders again by the counter staff.

The foods are perfect, I have been eating the ribeye steak and grilled chicken set for at least 5 times in the past few weeks and the quality has been very consistent especially the steak, the doneness is always right. Definitely best steak in choa chu kang area especially for this price.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106438863073448127565/reviews
Shark Sharkey,4,"Inside a neighbourhood coffee shop, is this western grill. Run by young adults üëç
Makes tasty salmon grill.
Pretty healthy fare, if you choose the items carefully. Can customize. üëç
Bring your own container if you wish to safe takeaway charges.
Also uses grass fed beef for sirloin and ribeye. üëçüëçüëç
Note: No more vegan meats.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109525289527506715896/reviews
C,3,"Chose Meet Meat for lunch takeout at Keat Hong Mirage, as it was the highest-rated stall on Google Maps with a 3.5‚Äîmost others were rated even lower. Stall also stood out with its setup and presentation, which gave a good impression.

I tried the Signature Cheese Burger and onion rings. Both were average. The burger portion was decent, but the flavors were didn‚Äôt stand out. The onion rings were meh.

If you‚Äôre in the area and craving something Western, it‚Äôs a passable option‚Äîbut definitely not something I‚Äôd go out of my way for. Overall, Keat Hong Mirage doesn‚Äôt strike me as a go-to destination for standout food.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
Diana Daud,2,last time a set of popcorn chicken and 1 side (i will usually choose onion rings) would be packed in a paperbox packaging and i would get around 6-7 onion rings. Now they change to a paperbag packaging and they keep giving ONLY 4 onion rings. The price is still the same btw.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103899199780830527139/reviews
Chunwen Huang,4,"Pretty good food with wide variety of choices. The fish & chicken combo is great, absolutely love how the fish is cooked. Marinara sauce is a little more towards the sour side. Sides wise, Sweet potato fries, coleslaw and Onion rings are pretty good. Their mac & cheese has a powdery texture which I‚Äôm not quite a fan of.

Lava beef burger is great, Patty slightly on the drier side but the cheese makes it better. Will try other stuff again!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636541114526759357/reviews
