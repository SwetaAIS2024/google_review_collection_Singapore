Hikigaya Hachiman,3,"I will be going around trying their stalls. However for today , it would be Mei Xin Tong Tau Foo. I really like the offer for the 5 ingredients with noodle/rice would cost no more than 5 dollars. Really quite a steal. For this meal, I had Curry Laksa Noodle (Yellow Mee).

The price is the main seller of the meal. Next, it would be the option for Laksa Curry and to deep fry your ingredients. Not always a given at your local YTF (Yong Tau Foo) stall. Additionally, the selection is as usual with the tofu with meat etc.

However ingredients wise , doesn't seem to meet the other franchises ratings. (I have not tired others. It appears to have decent ratings at other outlets). Ingredients does not seem as fresh, deep fried items are too dry and laksa curry was not as flavourful and slightly watery. It does have some spice kick nevertheless but nothing much for the spicy lovers.

I would give the stall a 2.5 ‚≠ê but bumped it up to a 3 due to the generous price. You could choose to skip and explore the other alternatives in this coffeeshop.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115167253350622568037/reviews
Lim Xiang Yun,1,"I would like to complain about the Mixed Rice Food Store, where the elderly lady was impolite and displayed unmannerly behavior toward a customer. The customer wanted to add more food, but she insisted against it, which was impolite. Kindly take measures as this has influenced customer experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467692845047115739/reviews
isabelle tok,1,"Unhygienic and bad service attitude by the stall auntie.

The kitchen uncle just uses his bare hand to grab the onion and bean sprouts after washing the floor and plates...

And I ordered my food before the other customers, but the stall auntie chose to serve them first .....",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114652931982251765238/reviews
Richard Lau,5,"Found a very nice Chinese dumpling shop here! The portion is huge and the price is very reasonable! Love the meat and the vegetable combination of the dumplings. They serve it with soup, dry and fry too! The best one of course is the most oily one, fry it! And must dip with the vinegar ya!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101673940051100677706/reviews
z nod,3,"The food tasted good. However, it was evident that hygiene and food safety was not properly maintained at most of the stalls. I won't mention specific stalls, but you can observe this for yourself when visiting.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103547068060963507719/reviews
