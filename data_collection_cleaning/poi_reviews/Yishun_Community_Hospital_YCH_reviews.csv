Mira Sabri,5,"The environment here is really peaceful. Unlike any other hospitals, here is not so “chaotic”. Staffs and nurses are all polite and friendly. Ample parking spaces and easy access to wards. You don’t have to walk so much.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116973731117632368880/reviews
OM Padme,1,"I asked for an exception as the ward was rather empty and as the family was advised that patient may not survive the admission, we asked to allow group exceeding 2. Assuring that we will be very discreet. It was ok but it was only on an adhoc basis. The senior nurse SF decided to put a stop on the 2nd day and I asked if I can appeal and  was told i cannot appeal but can only feedback.
I observed the ward was mostly empty and there were beds with more than the usual 2 visitor quota.
Is the decision based on SOP or a deterrent . I could understand if the ward are full and we had disturb the other patients.
Where is the compassion where an appeal was disallowed and stopped at the sister level.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116995159557076591645/reviews
Wenkie77 LTW,1,"My father was admitted to YCH. Hospital called me, tell me got to come sign some papers for admit my father. Hospital tell me come before 12pm cause nurse to sign paper going lunch at 12pm.
I come early at 11.30am.
Downstairs counter tell me cannot come up, visit hours 12pm then can.
Upstairs ward and downstairs counter your departments no talk each other one ah? Then need us your customers to feedback then you all react ah?

Hua Mulan,5,"Likened to that of a 5 star hotel or resort. A beautifully designed hospital with great facilities and very comfortable rooms and furnishings. Staff is very warm, attentive and friendly. Rooms are carpeted and have built in wardrobes and kitchenette facilities. Here is the view from the TOP floor loft lobby.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101197150496755553670/reviews
Ah Kao Tan,1,"Loosy customer service when hospital departments do not communicate between them about patients condition, treatment, paperwork and medicine.
The inconvience caused to the patient and their families is not a good benchmark of properly governed hospital, especially government hospital.
Cannot be you telling me this is the standard for a government organisation right?? Got to do reflection and soul-searching for this.. or health ministry can answer for this??",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113325989971353581911/reviews
