Liwei Chiang,3,Happen to walk around the area while looking for a place to escape afternoon sun ☀️. Not a big fan on ice cream so can’t really tell the fine between diff quality of ice cream. But the ambience was comfortable for a Sunday escape. Aircon was just strong enough. Not too crowded. A good place to relax.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110831823629358579813/reviews
ong MJ,3,Small cosy place to hang out if u happen to be near by. The staffs let u try any flavour that you want and their waffles are freshly baked. The ice cream are light so it is not for those that luv the thick creamy texture.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101520203038980544089/reviews

Jon Lau,2,"Sorry, but the ice-cream quality, taste and flavour is not good. The ice cream was served melting too. As an ice cream avid, this place needs improvement in order to match some of the other neighbourhood outlets. Hope to see it do better in future. Till then.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101664665401377179413/reviews
G L,5,Good service. The ice cream is light - not too sweet. Great place to catch up with friends in the neighbourhood. Like that it has yam ice cream.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105181118896064903016/reviews
