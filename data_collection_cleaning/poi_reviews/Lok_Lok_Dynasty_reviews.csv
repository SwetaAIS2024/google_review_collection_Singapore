Bryan Fang,4,"1st try of the loklok here. Bento set reminds me of ToriQ so this is probably the malaysian version of it.

Chose a number of sticks. Ate for fun without rice $15 worth. Deep fried and well-seasoned. Chose satay sauce to eat with, quite nice.

Can try try if you are dropping by here",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114490699769830179262/reviews
Jo. L,1,"I have been a customer of this place for the longest timeâ€¦ and never have I gotten such a horrible attitude from the staffâ€¦ every single time when I come, the guy with specs serves me and he is always super nice and kind but todayâ€¦. Pls a male stuff with leg tattoo and lady with specs served me and I swear I think they donâ€™t really like working hereðŸ˜° there were no trays outside, when asked for the tray the lady just went to wash it at the back and come back to give me in the possibly most unhappy face that seems like she donâ€™t want to workðŸ¤¨ when asked for another tray because we knew we were going to order a lot the girl again looked frustrated??? Then I looked in and saw that the guy was putting the broccoli on stick with his bare hands? Without any sorts of glove. Sorry but WHAT??? Idk manâ€¦ the food also came over fried? ? tough day for them? Honestly 3 stars for the food only because the chilli and beancurd skin was goodðŸ¥²ðŸ˜© I donâ€™t expect top tier service but at least smile? dk if Iâ€™ll be back anytime soonâ€¦",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106153033936644875607/reviews

Alexander Reinaldo,5,"Tasty lok lok at affordable price (compared to those at Chomp Chomp) with (very) spicy signature chilli and various options of skewers and individual stick price. Should you require heavier supper, they also offer rice option! Definitely a must try if you visit the area.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108446373348289716691/reviews
vincent liu,5,"Lok Lok are kept in a mini fridge to preserve the freshness of the items and it is very neat and clean. Prices are written on the sticks to ensure no surprises when footing the bill. The items are fried evenly with the crisp feel and chilli is the bombz. Enoki mushrooms with bacon, Taiwan sausage, scallops and prawn paste mantou are must tried items. For those who need carbs can order the rice with seaweed as well. It is perfectly for dinner and supper. Will definitely come back again!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106557325777579502480/reviews
