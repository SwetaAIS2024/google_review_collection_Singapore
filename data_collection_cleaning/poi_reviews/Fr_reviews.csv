zhi rui,5,"I worked nearby back in 2016, and had the chicken chop at least once a week. The chicken was good, suspect he put abit of  Kentucky-style powder on it before grilling it. Portion was super huge too for the price. I came back recently (2024) hoping to enjoy the chicken chop again. It tasted different to me this time. I couldn’t sleep that night wondering if it was the chicken chop that changed, or was it me. I know the sauce definitely changed (the new black pepper sauce was very overpowering) but I’m not sure about the chicken. The portioning is still huge though. Please let me know if you have a similar thought or experience too.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113460640663683933260/reviews

The coffee lady selling Kopi is very rude. The coffee is mediocre at best.

Then I eat at Al-Dia.
The food is so-so, But the price is expensive compare to what I had from other places.

But the atmosphere here is very nice. spacious ang full of colours.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108814157810044105812/reviews
