      "text": "Tried the Hainanese pork chop rice. The pork chop was hot and freshly deep fried but it was quite hard and overcooked. Tomato sauce was very sweet, perhaps they can place it on the side? The fries were surprisingly good- crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. May be back to try the other dishes but not the pork chop rice.",

Food wise is pretty good and the price is decent considering the inflation this year, was able to relax while waiting for the rain to pass. Feel like the beverage option was kinda limited but I guess it doesn't quite fit the theme of cafe that well.",
