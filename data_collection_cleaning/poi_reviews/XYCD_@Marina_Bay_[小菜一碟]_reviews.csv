Nam Nguyen,4,"Wow, I was mildly surprised to find this spot serve spicy beef noodles! This is a gem spot to find affordable Chinese mala dish in the marina area.

The only downsize is it is takeaway only which is okay if you are on the go or live nearby!

I ordered the spicy beef noodle (medium was perfect for me not too spicy) üçú and vegetable and pork dumplings ü•ü ! Both was great and I will be coming back to this üíé spot!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102008196120489661726/reviews
C ZY,1,"Food was ok, but service was really bad. Staff is rude. Pop by today to buy brunch, stand in front of the shop and wanted to start my conversation but no one bother to look at me. Ask the Indian lady which menu should I look as there‚Äôs two menu, she ignore me so I look at the menu and assumed I can order from the menu that says Tuesday special. When I order, the Chinese lady says look at another menu which I ended up choose from the menu, then it‚Äôs says Tuesday bento so I assumed everything is preset. After that, only I notice I have to pick my own side dishes. Next moment, the Indian lady stare at me say so which one you want with a rude tone. Then after I chose then she packed and leave it on the counter top and proceed to do her stuff.

I‚Äôm a new customer, how am I suppose to know Tuesday special don‚Äôt serve on Tuesday.

Side note, I‚Äôm the only customer when I was there. It wasn‚Äôt a busy time or peak hour.

Picked potato slice as my side dish but turn out to be sourish, like spoilt taste too. The rest was ok",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100777030251658424063/reviews
Wong Teck Jung,4,"Pretty good variety for mixed vegetable rice, and it tasted good, especially the chicken chop and spicy chicken (la zi ji). The order-to-cook dishes are only available after 1 pm.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115500349786770672418/reviews
Doppelgriff Ganger,3,"There is usually a snaking queue at this place so I decided to try it since I do have a weakness for mala flavoured anything. Queue was very long but moved fairly fast.

They stopped selling noodles and only have a list of options that comes with rice that varies by day

Ordered the chicken and you get to pick 3 sides. There weren‚Äôt many options with the sides, you already get rice but there was one option of glass noodles and another kuay teow. I ended up with 2 tofu and one veggie. Wish there were more greens options.

The mala tofu was too starchy. The steamed tofu was good and the chicken was decent.

I do feel like $12.30 (50 cents extra for brown rice) is a tad to expensive for chap chai png style though.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100675484031426420345/reviews
