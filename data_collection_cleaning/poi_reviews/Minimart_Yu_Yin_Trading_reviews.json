I did not say anything.\nI waited for him to served all the customers. Then, he asked for the pin and told me again I cannot come immediately. I told him calmly I did not come immediately. This was already one hour after the message. I also told him the message did not stated that I had to wait for two hours after the message received. Then, he told me he didn't have to give me the parcel and he could asked me to go home to come again.\nHe showed bad attitude even for a customer who never complain or demand anything.",

If you wish to get your parcel asap, you can consider avoiding after school hours (about 11am - 4pm), where the shop gets a lot of student customers, who even shoplift at times if they get impatient, forcing the shop owners to be vigilant. The other review are not wrong, but they do not show the full story. If being patient is too difficult for you, consider doorstep delivery. Cheers",

Shop was empty, approached the unapproachable shopkeeper and said \"hi, i want to collect my 2 items from shopee\" and his exact reply is, in the rudest tone with no eye contact \"you don't need to tell me you want to collect how many items, you just tell me your pin or phone number\". Nvm. I let you \"makan\" me there and then, but YOU don't need to tell me all that, YOU just need to ask me for my phone number or pin. You don't want to do this job, then remove yourself from the platform. Nobody forced you to sign up for this or maybe your life is too boring that you need this platform to scold people for your entertainment. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”",
