Mrvictor Ang,5,"Probably one of the best SG bkt in the area, the soup is quality, my family enjoyed it and now thereâ€™s a promo for their mixed ribs soup at $7. For 3 pax, we ordered 1 pot of da hong pao,  2 mixed ribs soup, 1 Mee Sua soup, 1 fried Ngoi Hiong, 1 tau gee, 1 cabbage and 1 fried you tiao. The only gripe is the white rice is too dry and of low quality. Other than that, service was good and soup was replenished.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112084752648078854588/reviews
Eileen Neo,5,"Food was strong in taste and a bit salty. But I do enjoy it as the service was great! Ample seats and well ventilated. The server took notice of our soup and kept coming back to top up. Wished that the portion could be bigger for the price paid. Tau pok came only in a few pieces, but tau kee were more.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111184748044561492651/reviews
Kevin Ang,5,Enjoyed the visit here for lunch. Lots of options focusing on Bak Kut Teh and side dishes that support it. Food is well cooked and delicious. Prices are still reasonable.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247294128726535324/reviews
Alvin Choo,5,"Saw online that they supposedly serve the best bak kut teh in Singapore at their Rangoon road outlet.

We were there during lunch when there was an office event nearby. The soup was really good and I would definitely go back for it. The tea was a bit intense due to the pot size.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
Colin Liew,5,"It's still the best place to have Bak Kut Teh.
The ribs are nice and tender.
The soup is flavorful and has the nice peppery taste I enjoy alot.
We ordered the ribs with liver, kidney, ngoh hiang fried sausage and salted veg.
Cheng Mei and another colleague were attentive, friendly and kept our bowls topped with piping hot soup.
The only reason I don't come as often as I wish is it's a little off the way for me to get to...
Otherwise. I'd probably be here weekly.
Final photo says all.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106136915560841794292/reviews
