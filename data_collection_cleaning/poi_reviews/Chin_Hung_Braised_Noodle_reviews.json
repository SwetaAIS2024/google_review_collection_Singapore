      "text": "Chicken Chop Lor Mee $4.50 (4/10)\nGravy is thick, and very starchy, with a slight herbal sweetness. I had to add a generous amount of vinegar to thin it out, which altered the flavour profile.\n\nThe chicken chop batter had the taste of flour, which could have been improved by longer seasoning.  Lastly the hard boiled egg was overcooked, and had the sulphuric smell. This was edible, but never again.",
