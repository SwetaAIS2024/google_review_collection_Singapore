      "text": "We‚Äôve been visiting this chicken rice stall since its earlier locations at Hougang and Beauty World, and it never disappoints. The rice is always served warm and fragrant, which IMO makes the meal particularly comforting. The white chicken is consistently smooth and tender, and their zesty, aromatic chili sauce is a perfect complement.\n\nThis stall definitely stands out as one of my favorite neighbourhood chicken rice spots!",
