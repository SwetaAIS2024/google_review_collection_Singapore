rina c,3,"calamari portion was really little for $22, was pretty much tasteless so we had to ask for salt & pepper. pastas were alright but not out of this world delicious, but it was good that we could choose our preferred pasta types. service was great though! service staff were attentive and refilled our waters without us asking. overall, food is quite pricey & mediocre but service is well done :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111692529636893426095/reviews
karen tay,4,"Looking for somewhere to eat after hike at DairyFarm. This was one suggested place.

It’s a Tuesday evening. Arrived before 7pm. Had difficulty finding parking lot (limited free lots).

Eventually did and we asked to sit outside. Bee was quick to set up table for us. However there were people standing nearby smoking and we changed to a table inside after placing our order.

We liked that it was not crowded (guess cos it was a Tuesday evening?) and aircon wasn’t too cold. We liked the music played but felt it was a tat too loud.

The other ‘noise’ that was quite irritating was the squeak the main door made when it rubbed against the floor each time it opens (and it happened quite many times as they had take aways and delivery pick-ups whilst we were there). Wondered why it wasn’t addressed/repaired).

Hvg said the above, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal: soup, main courses, dessert and coffee in a rather cozy ambience with pleasant service.

We would return (likely soon) to try the other selection!

Kudos to the chefs and Bee!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113031161773082512211/reviews
muffin Sweet,5,"We weren’t very hungry, so we only ordered soup and a pizza to share. Quite a big portion of soup and it was served hot - it was tasty and filling. The pizza was super with thin crust and generous ingredients. As it was made as we were drinking our soup, it was hot and crispy when served. Will return to try other dishes.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103549962793705801669/reviews
S C,5,"I recently visited this restaurant after a friend's recommendation, and I was not disappointed! The prices were reasonable, and the food was absolutely great.

The owner was incredibly friendly and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. I highly suggest making a reservation to avoid any disappointment, as it can get busy. Overall, I had a wonderful dining experience and will definitely be back!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113273299880380601002/reviews
Cheryl C,1,"Dropped by for dinner due to the rave reviews, but unfortunately we were turned away as we were told that the restaurant was fully booked for the night. The owner was accomodating enough to allow us takeaway, so we ordered 3 pizzas and a lasagne.

Tbh i set my expectations really high judging by the dinner crowd and online reviews, but it was the worst italian food i’ve had in sg. Lasagne itself was thin and had no tomato flavor, mozeralla was also flavorless. Pizza toppings were thin and almost dried out, cheese was a weird texture. Pizza dough was properly cooked at least, but tastes frozen and not fresh. Quality wise, even Saizeriya/dominos fares better which says alot. Truly wanted and expected to love this place but am sorely disappointed",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112905484022031826459/reviews
