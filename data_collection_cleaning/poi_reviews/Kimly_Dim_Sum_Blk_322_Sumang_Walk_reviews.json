Boycotted them for 2 yrs+ and decided to give them a try again. Got another slimy chicken on a weekend afternoon. üëè\n\nDo be careful when you buy for your kids or seniors.\n\nI have bought this item many times at other outlets before so I am certain the taste nor texture isnt normal.",

My take on it is the service is confirmed horrible, and yes by the same lady that most other reviewers mention. Of course we don't expect 5-star restaurant service with a smile, but there's also a bare minimum expected standard with this place doesn't hit, just too rude... And why?... I feel generous at 2-star because the food was ok, not amazing, but there are better dim sum places to go. (2-star is already higher than average of 1.7 stars at the time of this posting!)",
