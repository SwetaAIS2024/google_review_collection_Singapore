Kangen Water 4you,5,"Hi Princess Laundry. Your shop is clean n neat. The detergent smells very nice too. Allow me to make 2 suggestions.  One is, can you have a note changing machine? At times I only have RM50 dollar note. Two is, can you have another shop set up? Most machines are in use when I come especially on weekends. Thank you",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102865155476589451589/reviews

qamarussalikin ss,5,"This laundry is good.
Every day there is a cleaner to wash the machine, all the lint. Indeed, the clothes are clean and fragrant.

The disadvantage is that there is no cashless payment. Still have to exchange paper money for tokens",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100611541217318421439/reviews
