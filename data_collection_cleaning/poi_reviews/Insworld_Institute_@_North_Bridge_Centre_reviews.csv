Segna Kussujanarko,5,"One of the things I really like about Insworld Institute are the small class sizes. It allows the teacher to personally address the concerns and questions of each individual student during classes rather than having to gloss over them. It allows for a closer and more effective student-teacher relationship, which really helps us students in studying for our exams.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111720840805322610309/reviews
Paris France,5,I have been to the school.  I am quiet amazed on how a small school  can do so much for the students. Insworld's approach is very different from the other international schools I have been. Everyone knows everyone. zero tolerance on Bullying. ( which I dont know if it even exist there) overall experience is tremendous! Good job Insworld!,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111366281881937500519/reviews
