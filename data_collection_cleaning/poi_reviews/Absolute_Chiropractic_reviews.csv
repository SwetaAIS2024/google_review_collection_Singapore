Yasmin Ong,5,"I have been going to Absolute Chiropractic and have been seen and adjusted by Dr Bradley Power. I really enjoyed the comfort and relief after tractions and adjustments. My body feels light and I also feel less tension around my neck and shoulders that came about due to my occupation and repetitive posture.
The clinician and staff here are also very friendly and approachable. ☺️
Highly recommend to check out this clinic!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105242378455081973510/reviews
Darcus,5,"As someone with scoliosis, I have been seeking treatment here at absolute chiropractic for more than 2 years. Dr Bradley power is very knowledgeable and skilful. I often suffer from sniff necks that would lead to migraine and vomiting (sometimes). I find that the adjustments helped to relief tensions due to daily desk work. Highly recommend everyone that has spinal issues to visit the clinic.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116038875017704648845/reviews

Emm “Emeliana Quinn” Quinn,5,"Words cannot describe how thankful I am for Dr. Brad’s help. This place is a true gem. I have been having problems on neck and shoulder for years. Have met many other chiropractors but haven’t felt not much improvement.
Dr. Brad has been doing an amazing job.  He really knows what he's doing and he's very honest. Throughout his session, not only my shoulder pain is starting to less severe and but also learned about the body and how it works.
He is a generous Doctor who cares about his patients. Highly recommend him! I highly recommend this place for anyone who's contemplating getting chiropractic care! s. I wish I had come sooner!!

Sandy ( front desk lady) is always helpful , nice and pleasant too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109052918833747554957/reviews
