Your staff (the short Chinese girl!) just repacked it into another bag, not calling my number, no apologies and display the next customer’s number on the screen. I continue to wait to see what happens. Still nothing! At the end I had to be the one to ask her if that’s my order and then when she said thats mine!! Seriously??!???!! Additionally, the previous customer had gone with the drink, just repack and gave it to me?? And that’s your standard?????",

Service was great as the lady at the counter waited patiently for me to choose my drink. Then she was also friendly in guiding me to redeem the Far East mall voucher.",
