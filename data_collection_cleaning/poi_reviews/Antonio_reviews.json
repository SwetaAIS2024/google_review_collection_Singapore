Was asked if I was sure, and I confirmed it.\n\nThe item I ended up getting was straight up gamey and rubbery with a slimey feel as I chew.\n\nThe freshness of the steak is very clearly not there, which I don't expect since I'm ordering steak at a coffeeshop, but this makes the hygiene of the area questionable to me.\n\nTheir sides were alright. I like this place for their pasta and other items, but placing an order for a steak was regrettable.\n\nI ended up taking one bite and throwing everything away. It's inedible.",
