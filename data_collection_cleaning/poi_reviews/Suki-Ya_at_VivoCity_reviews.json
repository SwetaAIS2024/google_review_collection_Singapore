My only complaint was the amount of meat given to me and my lunch mate was different. He has way more meat than me. So would be good if thereâ€™s no disparity ðŸ˜€",

He was really good at his customer service. Very attentive to all tables and meticulous when he is cleaning and setting up for new tables. I noticed he even lifted up the heating board to wipe the sides below that were a little dirty. Heâ€™s a conscientious worker and I am glad to see sukiya being inclusive of people with disabilities. Heâ€™s the best service staff I ever encountered here over my years of coming here frequently. :) please give him my compliments!",

The variety of sauces is also great. And I like the garlic fried rice they have.\n\nA couple of times, we encountered their friendly service staff Philip (who happens to be hearing impaired) but he delivers good service with attentiveness and dedication, clearing empty and dirty dishes and adjusting our hotpot fire level by observing what we needed at any point of time.\n\nKeep it up!",
