I felt very taken care of, which is rare for clinics in Singapore. Good impressions just from front-desk interaction. Didn't get her name because I was a little too shy to ask but I visited on Saturday, 6.30pm (18 Jan)",

Dr Lim is a very patient doctor who will take time to explain about my condition after diagnosis. I have tried the Conjuran jab on the knees and pain have drastically reduced l. Staff are very helpful and friendly too. With much confidence in Dr Lim I have done the minimally invasive Rejuran jab on my face too which can help in regeneration of the collagen . The whole experience is a very comfortable and confident one",
