Flo Yeow,5,"Always important to have a public toilet that's accessible, whether smelly or otherwise. It's a functional toilet, deal with it. With all the activities that are happening around here, this isn't going to be a toilet you want to spend your life in. Do what you need to, and get the hell out. At least there's even a toilet, in a nature park.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
