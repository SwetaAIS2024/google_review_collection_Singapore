      "text": "Excellent food and service at Putien. Came to this branch for the first time because I really wanted to try their squirrel fish (it’s a yellow croaker carved deboned and carved into an ornamental shape resembling a squirrel and served in sweet and sour sauce), and we weren’t disappointed at all!\n\nThe squirrel fish was fantastic; the outsides were crispy but the meat was still tender and not dry, and the sauce was delicious. I love the addition of pine nuts to the sauce - in terms of both flavour and texture.\n\nTheir braised cabbage and beancurd soup is also really delicious, and you cannot not order their mazu mee sua. Every dish is really delicious and the ingredients are high quality.\n\nService is really excellent as well. We didn’t have a reservation, so we joined the queue by scanning a QR code. A what’s app message notifies you when your table is ready so you can walk around without having to wait. Once our table was ready, we were promptly seated and our orders promptly taken. The waitstaff are really attentive (even though the restaurant is packed) and will check on you often to see if there is anything you need and whether the food is to your liking. They even helped to serve us the soup even though they were so busy.\n\nWe’ll be back.",

Noise can be abit loud in the room if we don’t close the door. After the food are served, we closed the door. Our guests enjoy the food! They love the soup, sweet sour pork, chilli clams and eggplant! Thank you very much.",

The hot pot oyster with basil is delicious and special as well. Portion is quite large even though it is just a small one. Worth to eat again if nearby.",

      "text": "As a Michelin-rated restaurant, Putien delivers exceptional Fujian cuisine with unwavering consistency. The Lychee Pork impressed with its crispy texture and sweet-savory glaze, artfully shaped to resemble the fruit. Equally memorable was the Seafood Lor Mee—a hearty bowl of thick noodles in a robust broth brimming with fresh clams, prawns, and squid. The standout, however, was the Fermented Red Chicken: tender, fragrant, and expertly balanced, with red yeast rice adding depth without overpowering the palate.\n\nThe Westgate branch maintains Putien’s polished standards with elegant, minimalist decor and attentive, polite staff. Visiting at 4pm on a weekend meant avoiding crowds, allowing for a leisurely meal. While the Michelin badge might hint at pretension or questionable standards, the experience felt refreshingly genuine. Dishes were executed flawlessly, proving Putien’s mastery of tradition and technique. And to round things up the table side chilli sauce is a sweet and pungent kick to most dishes. A must-visit for those seeking refined flavors in a serene, sophisticated setting.",
