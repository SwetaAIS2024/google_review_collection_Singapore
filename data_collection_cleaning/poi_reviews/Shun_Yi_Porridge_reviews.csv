MNG,5,"This was a surprise find! An extensive menu is offered.

The porridge is cooked to a gruel. It was cooked with a great stock base which lent it good depth.

Cuttlefish was excellent, fresh and springy.

Braised peanut was a good balance to the overall dish.

I am looking forward to visiting again to try other offerings.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews

Yvonne Ang,5,"One of the best porridge ever. Always crave for the porridge after some time. It’s fragrant and has a good balance of saltiness. I always go for triple egg porridge and century egg porridge. The sliced pork porridge is awesome too with a unique pork fragrant.

The youtiao is unbeatable compared to other stores as they fry on the spot, so it’s crispy and hot. Shiok!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104185824818569199825/reviews
