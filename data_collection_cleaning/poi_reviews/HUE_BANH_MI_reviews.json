The vegetables are also fresh, crispy and refreshing.",

You don't have to be a self entitled sgp and raise your voice and make a scene.  For this price and the quality of food you are getting one should be real ashamed of behaving ill manneredly.\n\nEnd of the day , its just a Great couple selling honest good food,making a living.\n\nBe kind.",

While it‚Äôs an 8 minutes walk from the nearest MRT station, the journey is absolutely worth it. I couldn‚Äôt resist and started enjoying the delicious banh mi on my way back to the station.\n\nThe mango salad is a standout ‚Äî incredibly flavorful and addictive. Don‚Äôt miss out on their iced milk coffee, which perfectly complements the meal. The experience (friendly owners too!) was well worth the 1.5 hours travel time, and I‚Äôll definitely be returning. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
