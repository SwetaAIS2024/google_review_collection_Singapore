No q pole, no queue management. Only after we queue at where we think is right after a few minutes then they tell us we queue wrongly, need to queue all the way from the back when there were new customers, twice. Imagine asking us to requeue twice from the back just cause they didn’t share where the proper queue.\n\nAlso they won’t provide bags. Please bring your own.",
