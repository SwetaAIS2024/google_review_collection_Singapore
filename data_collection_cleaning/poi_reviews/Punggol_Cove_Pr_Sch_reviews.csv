Patrick Ong,5,"After spending 6 long years(my Daughter as well as Parent witness her development & happenings around my daughter).
This is a VERY Good School.
As far as Educational Subjects concerns.
I have met the English Teacher when my girl was in her first 3 years and still my girl will often mention her name(meaning this teacher has had a Very Positive impact on my girl).

The Principal - Mr.Dennis Yap.
Is always seen appearing in the morning along the side entrance(most students & parents approaches from this side entrance's gate).
Matter of fact,he silently created this opportunity to get himself ""Be Presence"" to the students as well as parents.
I sometimes walk to him and give some of my feedbacks or simply a short chats with Mr.Dennis Yap. (A warm & friendly personality that I find him approachable,good listener & pleasant. Thank you Mr.Dennis Yap 🙇🙇😍😍).
