prathap yuvi,5,"I recently dined at Viva Loca, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The ambiance is vibrant and welcoming, perfect for both casual meals and special occasions.

The menu offers a diverse range of dishes, each bursting with flavor. I highly recommend trying their signature cocktails, which are expertly crafted and complement the meal perfectly. The food presentation is beautiful, and every bite showcases fresh ingredients and innovative flavors.

The staff Sania  was attentive and knowledgeable, making excellent recommendations that enhanced our dining experience. Overall, Viva Loca is a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy delicious food and drinks in a lively atmosphere. I can't wait to return!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109142415893542067621/reviews
Avani Arora,1,"I wish there was a negative star button too ! the evening was a total disaster , we went there with family ( 2 kids along ) table of 7 to watch the match screening. we ordered drinks and food , the 2 cocktails cosmopolitan came with ants in them and then next Singapore Sling as well , we told the manager and he mentioned must have fallen in while walking to the table , which surprised us we spoke to the owner and he was so casual and said we have 400 people today cant help it , we could not believe the attitude of the owner we decided to leave as we did not trust the food quality to feed our kids . but this didn't stop he followed us and was abusive and aggressive and said you need to pay as you ordered , but we did not touch the food and were even disgusted to think how to eat here especially our kids, but the owner was obnoxious . being from the hospitality industry myself I could not believe the behaviour towards customers infact other customers sitting there came to control the owner as he was misbehaving a lot and they apologised to us !! .. this place is not worth a minute of your time . See photos of the drinks as proof.  IMAGINE THE CONDITION OF THE KITCHEN AND THE STANDARDS OF THE FOOD .",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102338169487396054856/reviews
Terrick W.,4,"Our first visit to Viva Loca. Overall a four star for us. Food taste great and service is fine. Environment a bit quiet for weekend lunch. Price is reasonable. We could have ordered less due to their portion. We like their Pani Puri, Chimichanga and Chicken Biryani. Samosa is also good.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117988793492560252192/reviews
