Richard Tan,4,"This place is tuck away at almost the end of Hillview Terrace and many people may not know it’s existence. I have patronised this place many times and I like the ambience very much as it gives a very kampung feel. Unfortunately due to teh lack of dining in customers, only two stalls are left opened and they depend on Food Delivery services to survive. The drink stall only open in the day but for the evening diners you have to self service and take the bottled drinks from the fridge.

Beside the kampung ambience, I like the Thai food and the chicken wings. Delicious. Don’t expect good service, though.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106165873437868392637/reviews
Leslie Lim,5,"The food is good
The place is secluded and windy
The ppl r friendly here especially the Thai food stall
We ordered some really nice Thai milk tea and Western main
The popcorn chicken come with generous portion and the chilli crab sauce is really good

If you drive can park the car at Hillview industrial building

The steak is ok
The Thai MaMa noodle and chilli crab chicken chop is good
We spend some good time some nice Thai and Western food

Thank you",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102519964482517679676/reviews
William Chee,1,"The staff here ask me dine in or takeaway when there was no dine in allow. Asked for toast set B2 and teh then she keep reply me teh ah? Finally she get it but tell me egg need to cook 7 min and later on say again cook for 3 min, and ask me back how i going to takeaway the egg. Halo how i know how you going to prepare takeaway food? I think the auntie was already drunk in the early morning. Somemore the staffs here wear mask under chin at all time. I come here 3 times and there isn't single time the auntie and uncle able to serve item/size correctly. Avoid their drink station at all cost. The Thai food here and Bowl & Makan pretty good by the way.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117584020471224540406/reviews

Parked inside and kopi uncle told me cannot park. The aunty next to him told him if buy fr them can park.

Wei Lim,4,"Nice quiet plc, tucked in a corner of a small turn-off from Hillview Ave. Tried the Thai food, served by chirpy thai staff. It’s quite enjoyable. Stay this way.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117712464373088999260/reviews
