Start from the service, the packaging was amazing with that kind of price, for the laksa or noodle, they gave separate the soup. It's yummy for me and family. The chicken rice set was tasty as well. I love it! Looks like i bought proper bento so I can bring it somewhere such as work or picnic. Nice! Keep it up please and I'll buy it again and again next time.",
