      "text": "Had an OKAY experience at Flutes. The ambience is elegant and serene — perfect for a relaxed meal or special occasion. The service was warm, attentive, and professional throughout.\n\nThe standout dish for me was the salt and pepper fish wing — crispy on the outside, tender and flavorful on the inside, complemented perfectly by the tartare sauce. Absolutely delicious!\n\nThe beef tip tir, while cooked well and nicely plated, could be improved in terms of flavor depth and balance — it felt like it was missing that final touch to tie everything together.\n\nOverall, a great place with thoughtful presentation and quality ingredients.",

      "text": "I would give 6/5 if I could — everything here was faultless and so delicious. Really hard to do but somehow each dish was a standout with all the incredible, high quality ingredients doing the talking. We went for a celebratory dinner and it was everything you’d want for an occasion: incredible service, amazing food and an elegant space to enjoy it all in. I wish I could say there was a highlight but every course was fantastic. I’m a sucker for a pavlova and this one hit it out of the park and I also loved the Alaskan king crab salad (so fresh and light), the cod and the A5 beef skewer which was very flavourful. The wine list is approachable with all price points available. Shoutout to our server as well who was very thoughtful and gracious and knew the menu in and out as well as the wine list. Thank you!",
