You can also host private events here.\n\nWe tried their Buka Puasa Menu which comes with a main and drink. Acceptable taste and good meat portions.\n\nExcellent service with friendly staff too.",

I tried their pizza  truffle mulligan and golden banana bliss, it was soooo delicious & yummy. Their mocktails also very fresh. Overall I gave them 5 stars for the services and food.",

They have a minigolf course and a karaoke room on the second floor, but the stairs are located outside, right next to the main door.\n\nIn terms of food, I think there is room for improvement. I ordered karaage chicken, but it was a bit overcooked, leaving a bitter taste. The banana split was just okay.",
