AlexNicholas,2,"chicken is too dry and expensive, 5 items Indian rojak cost $11?!? and the sauce is a bit too sweet. definitely not ""king"" standard food.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106023226129429339053/reviews
Dagurasu Y,1,"CAREFUL!!!!!!!!

Rice: $1.50
Mutton Soup: $6.00

Total: $7.50

Just a small bowl of soup charge $6.00, soup is not hot at all. Spring onions smells(not fresh). The rice alone cost $1.50 for a normal rice, which I can buy 3 bowls next stall at 50cent each.

Overall experience: Disappointed

For next Customer who ordering, please remember to ask him for the price first before you place an order. They do not key in cashier when they collect payment. Very dishonest. Shouting at other customers and being rude, another customer walked away after my order.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108953867229821707036/reviews
Nabilah Jalil,5,"Halal indian muslim food, briyani is big portion and surprisingly good taste (disclaimer, though some days taste different). Prata and thosai taste good as well.

It’s quite nearby so it’s handy to get food from here. Alhamdulillah",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115174974811319777578/reviews
