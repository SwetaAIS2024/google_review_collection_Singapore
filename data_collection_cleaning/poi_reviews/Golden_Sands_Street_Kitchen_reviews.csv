HP Tan,5,"This is one zi char store worthy of promoting. The wok hei is good. Food is cook very fast yet the taste is not compromise. A very good portion is given too.

Gabby Fantasy,5,"This was a surprise for me today as I was looking for something to eat late afternoon.
It looked good and tasted good. At $4.50 a plate laden with wok hei rice noodles and ingredients aplenty, this was heaven sent. I normally like hor fun like this with sliced red chilli. The taste is well paired.
Got to try the others next time when I go to that outlet again.
Maybe a steamed fish and stir fried dishes next?!
The price is right for me.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101655359401510706082/reviews
Isaac,4,"Fish head curry and stir fried chicken were nice. The Pork rib was way too tough. Generally above average standard. Keep it up, guys.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101456387178339782065/reviews
Kimli,5,"I got to know of Golden Sands after seeing @immichellechong share her meal on Instagram. Found out that they were near me and I love tze char so I thought, why not give it a try and support our local businesses during this time. (They deliver islandwide, but I prefer nearby places üòä) I was not disappointed, prices are reasonable and food was tasty with generous portions. Service was very pleasant as well - both the person who took my order on Instagram and the delivery personnel. I was thinking of paying in cash and checked if they accepted it - they prefer PayNow, but they were willing to accommodate just for me. I did PayNow eventually as I didn't want to trouble them and it wasn't a hassle to me actually. My grandma really liked the fish head set we ordered (pictured) and she got me to order the same set to my other relatives as well, so I just ordered again from them. ‚ù§",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114734340702288797305/reviews
