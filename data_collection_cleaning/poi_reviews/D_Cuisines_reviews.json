      "text": "Located in SIA Sports Club, this dining place is really not known to many people. There were only a few tables occupied during lunch time.\n\nServes mainly Indian dishes, though there were also others and sets are also available at more economical pricing.\n\nWe tried a mutton dish, Rogan Josh, a chicken dish and a prawn biryani, with garlic naan. Though the mutton and chicken dishes came in small bowls, do not be fooled by the size.  There were generous chunks of meat in them.  Both the chicken and mutton were well flavoured and the mutton had no strong gamey smell to it and was tender to the bite.\n\nPersonally, I like the prawn biryani most, the rice was fragrant and tasted really authentic, it had the taste that I get in most Indian restaurants in the Middle East but not really here. The prawns were pretty good sized, well seasoned and very fresh and gives a crunch as you bite into it.\n\nService wise is just so-so, nothing worth mentioning. All these plus 3 drinks for about $70 is pretty reasonable for me. A very satisfying lunch indeed in a nice and  quiet environment. There are lots of parking too.  I would surely be back, I love Indian food!",

Another great meal and another nice cup of masala tea.\n\n20 Dec 2021: Superlicious combination of Chinese and Indian food. Yummy! Been here many times and it's a nice and quiet place to enjoy the delicious Indian and Chinese food. Enjoyed the Indian selections and some of our favourites to go with naan are Palek Paneer, Butter Chicken, Rogan Josh, Aloo Ghobi and Tandoori. The mutton briyani is also very yummy and we usually end our meal with a cup of Masala tea (less sweet)",
