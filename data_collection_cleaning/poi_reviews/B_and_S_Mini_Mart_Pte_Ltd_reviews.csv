Hnin Wut Hmone,1,"Today I just bought cauliflower and two cans of Coca-Cola. The thing what happened to me is really ridiculous. The cashier Chinese woman asked me to put my phone on the table and she did herself everything to pay now cuz I said I’ll pay now. I told her that this is my phone and I’ll do myself then she said some customers cheat and I need to protect myself and for ur protection also that’s what she said. And then she said go. That’s how she treated the customer.I hope that you’ll do sth for that for me!
