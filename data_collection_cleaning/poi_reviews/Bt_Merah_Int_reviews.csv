Shawn Lowell LI,1,"Everyone here is complaining!! The buses here are never on time!!!

Another update, see attached photo with date and time on. Scheduled 13:09, no bus at the bay, many people waiting, till 13:11, still waiting, and scheduled to 13:22...

This is an update. Still about 272, and still disappointed. Nothing has improved. Arrive at the berth at 8.38, already 2 old ladies waiting. Display show next bus at 8.40, now 8.48 never come, and departure time changed to 8.52...

Many buses are not punctual especially 272. Showing 1448 depart but driver only on board after 50, and arrive at berth 1452. Not once but often times like this!  What's the point of showing departure time when you cannot make it? Disappointed!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113376066617728504826/reviews

Rockermocker rock (Rocker),1,"Bus 57 never arrive on time. Always taking own sweet time to reach the Berth pick up point and then the driver drive damn fast after that. Supposed to reach my destination on time but always late because of bus service non punctuality.
SBS transit, do something about your timing instead of increasing fares but punctuality still not up to standard. Moreover at an interchange, there shouldn't be delays due to ""traffic"".",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100606182550159029030/reviews
