How can we pride ourselves with service excellence when there is no one to get through to, and worst of all, information counter is calling their service staff in the terminal yet nobody is answering. And since it’s a glass door, I can clearly see there are sats staff at the counter BUT NOT PICKING UP THE PHONE.",
