It didn't disappoint!\n\nStaff were generally very friendly and helpful! We went on a weekday afternoon!\n\nThe staff was very patient and helpful; he explained the rates, some of the games to us. We had some bites and drinks. It was a family bonding time!\n\nWe had enjoyed ourselves thoroughly! Will be back again!",

      "text": "My friends and I had patronized Settler Cafe by Mosanco for many times. We love their signature Acai Bowls and always order extra almond butter for sides. Loved their chicken chop, charcoal burgers, crab linguine, Korean chicken soup and this dish on season and hope they will be back soon, mashed and chicken is a must try dish. This cafe is about 10 mins walk from Farrer Park (purple line). Best part is this cafe is operated for 24 hours x 7 days. You may consider to chill with your friends with board games for bonding at this cafe esp in air conditioning environment. Give a try ðŸ˜‰",

      "text": "I have fond memories of enjoying a warm, buttery croissant during past visits to this establishment. It was always served with a delightful side of butter, and the experience was a treat.\n\nUnfortunately, my recent visit was a stark contrast. The croissant tasted unfreshâ€”stale and oldâ€”and wasnâ€™t served warm, which was disappointing. To make matters worse, the side of butter seems to have been replaced with what tasted like low-grade margarine. Itâ€™s clear that cost-cutting measures have impacted the quality of what was once a standout item on the menu.\n\nOn a positive note, I want to commend the staff. The ladies working there were kind and friendly, which added a small silver lining to an otherwise underwhelming experience.\n\nI hope they consider returning to the high standards they once upheld because the potential for excellence is still there.",

The babycinno is essentially just milk with some cocoa powder haha, but the scrambled eggs and cheese fries were great, especially the latter!\n\nOne of the people working there gave everyone a mini coupon book?? (yay) So me and my friend managed to redeem an hour of board games w any menu purchase. Not very crowded on saturday afternoon too :)",
