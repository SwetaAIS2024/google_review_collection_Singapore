K,5,"What's great?
Dim lights, comfortable chairs, homely feel,  artsy inspiring environment. Good for exterior crowd watching before the place itself gets crowded. Meatballs are nice. Cappuccino is served in a thick wall cup keeps it warm.

What's to improve?
Some chairs with torn seats should be replaced or have a seat padding.

Visit again?
Yes,.at non peak hours.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109386738253826668143/reviews
Jennifer Loy,3,"Easy location just outside beauty world MRT , setting is nostalgic but food is mediocre. I ordered the pork with fries and mashed. The meat is on the hard side. Fries are crisp but perhaps should be served with a vege rather than a mash potato again",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100747820698914158458/reviews
Michael TAN,4,Quaint little place. Very cozy and love the decor. Came here for dinner and the food was good and affordable. Food was value for money. It was a pleasant surprise. Will definitely come back again.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106408988733162382676/reviews
Angeline,1,"Terrible service. Two staff rostered but both having break together even though the cafe indicated that it is opened. When asked, staff was very rude and pointed to their sign at the cashier that they are having a break.  Perhaps could improve in your staff rostering so that you don't make your customers come all the way to the cafe and having to wait. I will never come again. There are better cafes around",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107078272533439315732/reviews
Cath HL,4,"Generally a can’t go too wrong cafe. Great variety of food. Quality and quantity are quite good.

Friend ordered an ice-blended yuzu drink (see photo). It’s more like an yuzu soda with lots of crushed ice. Not what we expected and were very disappointed.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113534105611246032753/reviews
