Gilang Tirta Kurnia,4,"Stay here at 2018. Bunkbed Hostel at Kampong Glam, the location is strategic and near Bus Stop. 1km walking to Bugis Street. The room clean enough and quiet for resting and sleep. Affordable price for backpackers.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108704002613995159265/reviews
Bala,1,"Today, 11/04/2025: Currently, ABC Hostel is functioning like a foreign workers' dormitory and is in very poor condition due to lack of maintenance. For example, one section of the rooms has been experiencing frequent MCB tripping during peak hours — more than 50 times a day for the past 3 months — and it is still not fixed. The toilet seats are extremely stained and unusable. The rooms lack proper ventilation, resulting in high humidity levels (over 90%), which is causing health issues for the occupants.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114293612885598836067/reviews
Mun Yee Yeow,2,"Location good. But cleanliness average. Only 1 sharing toilet, but our double room with own shower.   Not standardize bedding. A mattress on top of Wood frame. They are under renovation. I think after they made changes then it will be better. At least the shower and toilet is new. But the piping not good. As we are staying ground floor, upper floor water in the shower came to our floor. Can sighted the foam and water.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103508277109855324848/reviews
Maria Clara S.,2,Have a good experience. But was too crowded. Very little amount of toilets for the amount of people. Wasn't enough space for luggage in the room so all the things for every guest where all around the place. And construction materials in plain sight in a open room that would be a good place if they use it to put the luggage of the guests.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106578467495655223600/reviews
Rizki Fahrurrazi,5,"I was going for study trip on 2012, and stayed in this hostel for 2-3 days. It was quite good, the service was ok, the room was nice, the wifi was super fast at that time, and not too crowded, you'll got a very nice breakfast, breads with fruit jam. I really love it. Didn't have a bad experience at all thankfully.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104471614132646164454/reviews
