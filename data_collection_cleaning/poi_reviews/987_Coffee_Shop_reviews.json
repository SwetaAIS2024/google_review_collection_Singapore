Really good. All I can say is a must try dish, but I think they only have it at limited period.",

Things to avoid if you want to add on I think are the lobster balls and sausage/hotdog and beef.\n\nAs previous reviews mentioned, people here are friendly, thus I had a good dinner and dining experience. Too bad 串串were sold out.",
