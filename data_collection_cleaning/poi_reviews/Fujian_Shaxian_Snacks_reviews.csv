Derrick Lin,4,"Taste traditional, the lady at the cashier is really friendly and prompt. The wanton was small but delicious, it’s totally different taste from our Singapore wanton. The only complaint is that the noodles is a bit soft and soggy, next time must ask them to not overcook it. The fried noodles texture is okay with lots of meat.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105989843156970934066/reviews
Lorelai D,4,"On the way to fix my luggage wheels at this popular shop at Eunos, I needed to wait for half an hour for it to be fixed so I just randomly checked out the coffee shop near by.

Saw this shop selling quite a unique cuisine compare to the usual fare and decided to try it out.

This place serve noodles and dumplings cooked in Fujian style.

I ordered their dumplings & meat ball combination soup and a scallion noodles which comes with either peanut sauce or scallion oil. I have the latter one as I spotted some interesting chili oil at the counter and thought it will go very well with it.

The dumplings were light and have a good texture around it while the meat balls essentially were pressed meat balls or slices that has a define chewiness to it. I love the contrast of the ingredients.

The noodles for $2.80 was great, I topped it up with some chili oil and it was such a great add on to the soup I have ordered.

This make me even more curious of what kind of Funian cuisine could be out there.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110563036404967613068/reviews
Jessalyn Tan,5,Not too bad! Had the yuan yang soup ($4.50) and noodles with scallion oil ($2.80). Nothing wow with the noodles. The texture is nice but it doesn’t have any scallion oil taste nor smell The meat is very smooth and quite q. Overall is pretty good and I would definitely visit again!,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103408120454119804369/reviews
