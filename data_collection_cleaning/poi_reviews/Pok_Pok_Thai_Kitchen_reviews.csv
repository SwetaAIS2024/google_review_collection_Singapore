Chung Chan Lee,5,"Today we tried Pineapple Fried Rice, Green Curry, Prawn cake, Mango Sticky Rice.

Pretty good green curry, although the look seems quite diluted, the taste is strong and thick. With plenty of chicken inside.

Pineapple Fried Rice is ok above average. Prawn Cake is very nice I must say.

I really like the mango sticky rice. Mango is very fresh and sweet, sticky rice just nice texture, I really love the coconut milk, it is not very sweet, more towards salty. And it is very thick. All mixed together the mango sticky rice really give a deep impression. This is the must order I recommended.

Overall very nice Thai Restaurant. The price is affordable.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117128048930233712616/reviews
Lionel Tan,4,Fairly average Thai food establishment in HDB area. Thai milk tea is large and very sweet. Best to ask for less sweet. Thai green curry too watery and average taste. Price is acceptable.

Lee Ling,3,"Nice decent Thai food. Been eating here a few times. But today meals, I felt that the food portions are getting lesser and lesser. If so then won't come by to eat anymore.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117490822632891507332/reviews
Stephanie Tan,2,"Rather lacking in standard of food quality. Fried rice 2 plates both were mashy, luke warm and not tasty. The basil pork belly was dry and tough. And the app ordering wasn’t intuitive - for seafood fried rice why give options for other meat when it should be defaulted. And the server raised voice at clarifying with us. Really unpleasant. First and last time we will patronise.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115701675631046201219/reviews
Sarah,3,"We ordered the Minced Pork omelette, Pork Pad Thai, clear Tom Yum soup and Thai honey chicken together with one Thai Ice Tea which came up to around 15 dollars per pax.

In terms of service, the staff serving us weren’t the friendliest but the dishes were served very quickly. Personally felt that none of the dishes were very remarkable other than the pad Thai. Seemed like the chicken was doused in a lot of honey and there were probably more flour bits than meat. My friend and I also agreed that the omelette had little to no minced pork. The Tom Yum soup was decent. The pad Thai was pretty good though, flavourful and of a sizable portion.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101630950205929636132/reviews
