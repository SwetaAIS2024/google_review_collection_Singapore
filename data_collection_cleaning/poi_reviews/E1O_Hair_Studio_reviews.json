Lucky for me, Leon was available! He was friendly, patient, empathetic and even made sure I wasn't feeling too cold from the air conditioning. The head massage and hair wash were amazing. I felt that I was very well taken care of and I would like to return for other services in the future :)",

The vibe in the salon was really welcoming, and everyone there was friendly and cool. The boss was super funny too. The place was clean and had a good vibe too. Already recommended this place to my friends! Five stars, no doubt!",
