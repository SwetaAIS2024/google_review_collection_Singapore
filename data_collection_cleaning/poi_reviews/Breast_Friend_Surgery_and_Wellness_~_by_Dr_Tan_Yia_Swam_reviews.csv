Angeline Ng,5,"I was referred to Dr Tan Yia Swarm by my family physician for some issues to manage. My observation for this clinic and the surgeon are 1) a professional team  2) an empathetic doctor with good bedside manners 3) definitely not pushy  . I enjoyed my consult and my process of the surgery that I had to go through. It meant a lot to me when I had to manage my emotions over the fearful impending surgery .  A lot of people are fearful of young doctors . However I must say Dr Tan is definitely forward looking, knowledgeable, and definitely one whom I would confidently recommend my friends and family to.  Thank your Dr Tan for your implacable skill . Am deeply grateful.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118002874327796460590/reviews

Chuchiau Chuchiau,5,"I had an excellent experience with Dr. Tan Yia Swan.  She is not only a highly skilled breast surgeon but also a kind and patient listener. Her ability to explain everything clearly and provide genuine care made a significant difference in my journey. Dr. Tan was an exceptional counselor during our conversations‚Äîher words and compassion brought me to tears, offering me a sense of relief. Her expertise in diagnosing and managing my rare breast condition was remarkable, and her support gave me the confidence and comfort I needed.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to nurse Suzy who was equally caring, attentive, and supportive throughout the process. Their kindness and professionalism made the entire experience even more reassuring. I truly appreciate Dr. Tan and her team for their excellent care. Highly recommend!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114655878042619429943/reviews
