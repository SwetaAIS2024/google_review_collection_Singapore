Ashley Liew,5,"Been coming to The Palms, a cafe at Singapore Swimming Club, since I was a child decades ago. So glad this cafe is still doing well all these years! They try to reinvent themselves with their menu that gets refreshed periodically. The staff here are their biggest asset, and although they can get busy during peak hours, they do put their best foot forward to serve the diners. The food is usually quite good here too. Thank you! üôèüèª",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Jacob TAN,4,"A friend invited us for lunch here. The restaurant is spacious with plenty of sitting space. It offers a wide variety of food, from local, Chinese and Indian. We ordered our food for sharing.
First was the laksa. It a big bowl which is enough for two small eaters to share. Generous amount of noodles and ingredients. The laksa gravy had good coconut taste and it is not spicy.
Both the chicken tikka masala and the fish curry were excellent and goes well with the garlic butter naan and the briyani rice. The two paneer dishes were ok.
I like the mutton briyani but it was quite gamy. Some people may not enjoy it. Overall, there was enough food for the four of us.
The cakes and coffee were enjoyable.
Service here was good.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
Bugwagen,4,"Food was average but ok value.  Rojak was average, tauhu goreng was good, laksa was too lemak and not enough flavour, the pan fried bee hoon had a lot of carbs/ bee hoon but not much ingredients.  The chempedak cake, yam cake were not bad, soft and spongy and can taste the chempedak/ yam.  The Christmas log cakes we took away were a bit dry.  Service was disappointing, seems rather short-handed and hard to get their attention even though it was not that crowded.  We were there on a Tuesday night.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109071563364310385081/reviews
Aud Vianney,4,Okay it seems they have an Indian chef really skilled. The Indian food we ordered was really good and not too spicy so we could really enjoy it. Check some of the pictures... The only thing is the service that is not really competitive. Quite slow and we had to wait like 15min just to have others garlic naans (Indian bread). Thats the only thing actually not perfect üòÖ,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104312804738497244824/reviews
