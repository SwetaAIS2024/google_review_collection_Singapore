Sophia Ang,5,"I ordered a Pineapple Fried Rice $5 and added an egg $0.80 on 3 Sep 2024. When I collected my order, I saw some burnt bits on my fried egg so I removed them with my spoon on the spot. The stallowner Ms. Toom saw me doing it. Later, while I was eating halfway, imagine my surprise when she came up to me with a freshly fried egg in a bowl at no extra charge! Was so touched! ðŸ¥°

This stallowner has integrity and is very kind and friendly. I will definitely patronise her stall again! ðŸ˜Š",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103947385276367415272/reviews
Valentina KYL,5,"Ordered chicken drumstick noodle. When it came it was 5 drumlets, with some fried wanton skin and some ball (not sure what meat). Soup was like braised gravy, a bit on the salty side but a change from the usual Thai food in SG. There was plenty of fried lard pieces, and fried garlic too.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110211616123519119360/reviews
