As I've said in many reviews about drinking in SG I'd rather pay for good beer than regular beer and these beers really hit the spot. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable as well. A hidden gem in SG. Highly recommend.",

Pictured is a can I bought to takeaway, when asked “which one would you recommend for me to take home?”, he answered “dont know, never tried & obviously i wont try”. Lol ok bud.",

Offers locally-produced/brewed and imported (mostly American) craft beers alike, which are a bit on the high side (common problem among craft beer places in SG). IPAs, lagers, and fruit beers (like citrus and berry beers) are a bit overrepresented in the roster.\n\nLots of great nibbles to be paired with the beers, particularly fritters, popiah, oyster omelette, and radish omelette (chay tow kway).",
