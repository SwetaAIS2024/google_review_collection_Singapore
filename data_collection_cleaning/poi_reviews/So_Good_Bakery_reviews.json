She could have politely inform me that they are closing the section. The signage is so small. Make it bigger if you are so particular about it. Whatâ€™s with the lousy service when the pastry is not even nice. Seriously.",

I guess f&b faces all sorts of challenges.\n\nAnyway, I initially wanted to but didn't buy this time round after seeing the fly visit various buns.. but i guess I've been eating the same all these while without seeing the fly ðŸª° for myself! Haha.. I'll always come back to support them.. I like their buns.",

Wide range of bakes to choose from and the beauty of this bakery is that it is ideally located at the corner and one will never miss it. The wide array of selections coupled with reasonable price points, why hold back and not give their bakes a bite!",

Tasted good even when kept overnight.\n\nCrispy cream cheese bun has a flaky dough and tasty cream cheese filling, very well balanced overall.\n\nRecommend to take home for tea time or breakfastâ€¦.",

      "text": "Amazing Hongkong-style bakery in Singapore, located at 100 AM Mall in Tanjong Pagar. They have the best salt breads in Singapore, it is so buttery inside, nice and crunchy on the outside, and has the right amount of saltiness! I love to freeze it at home, and when I reheat I sprinkle some water on top and bake in the airfryer for 6 minutes. It is heavenly, definitely recommend trying their salt bread. Super satisfying.\n\nThey also have great bolo buns and sugar donuts!",
