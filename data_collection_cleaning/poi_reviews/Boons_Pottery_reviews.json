What a shame",

      "text": "Never regret attending the trial lesson at Boon’s pottery, Mr Boon is a very patient and humorous uncle which make our session very fun! Even though we wanted to just try it out with an expectation of not bringing any pottery home due to our clumsy hands, we were surprised that he taught us all the tips and tricks which makes it very easy master.\n\nHis teaching method does intrigue me to take up more lesson but sadly his classes are mostly taken up :(\n\nNevertheless, my wife and I were very happy and enjoyed so much at his pottery studio.\n\nA big 5 star to Boon’s Pottery",

The instructors are very knowledgeable and skilful. A few of them have decades of experience. The location is also very convenient.",
