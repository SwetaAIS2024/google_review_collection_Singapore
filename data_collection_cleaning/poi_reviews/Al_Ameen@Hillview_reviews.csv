T Tan,5,"Nice tranquil kampung vibes...
The boss and staff are very attentive, warm and friendly..

$10/- Mutton murtabak (ONLY BEFORE 12NOON AND AFTER 4PM) tasted very flavourful. Better than Zam Zam. Much much better than Springleaf. The curry wasn't really required. 5/5

$9 Mutton biryani.. super good quality basmati that is lighter in ghee but still super aromatic from the spices... Mutton was very flavourful. Better than Zam Zam.

$1.50/- Teh Halia impressively strong and robust tea taste. Very consistent 5/5

Come here if you wanna relak one korner with free parking good food and good vibes... Away from stuffy malls and over-rated places.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105342097727930447553/reviews

Their plain nann is not so nice as compared to their butter garlic nann.

mohd hairuldin,5,Had breakfast at this makan store. Owner n staffs r very friendly. Parking wise need to find as it is located around private estate. Food portion is enough per person. Those craving roti prata sarang burung can dropby to try and teh tarik ice is nice.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104353821700929300396/reviews
Aason Than,4,"Recommend the Maggi Goreng Thai Style. It is slightly wet but always flavorful and good to slurp. I always come back once in awhile.

In my latest experience though, the staffs are a little less friendly as compared to how it used to be. The lack of acknowledging you when you made eye contact and just walking away... but of course this could be a one-off or a bad day for the said staff. I hope management would also care for staff if they are not feeling well to be serving.

Will continue to support for the great Maggi Goreng.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105507199431117793886/reviews
