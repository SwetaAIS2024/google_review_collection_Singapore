Online also sell the same product but at a delivery cost of $16 and good luck if you receive the product safely else it may be ended at door step unattended.",

      "text": "Shame on its customer service for Singapore Mint. I have visited 2 of its retail outlets regarding its stock status but both referred me to call the HQ which I did. Then I am told to send email, yet after 3 reminders... there is no reply at all. I urge collectors to be wary of the item that doesnt produce by them cos they may not bring in subsequently. Hate to be left in this situation. Really disappointed!",

She sent in the cheque  in order to qualify for the ballot for the Kim and Trump coins, trusting in Singapore Mint. She was informed in July that her ballot was unsuccessful but it has been a more than a month and she hasn't gotten back her money. She called and asked but was told several times that the cheque will be sent to her. But so far, nothing! Singapore Mint, you are supposedly a reputable brand name and yet what are you doing there with the long delay in the refund. Never again!",
