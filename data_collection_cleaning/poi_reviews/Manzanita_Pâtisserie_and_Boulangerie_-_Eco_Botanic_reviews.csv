Pratima Giri,5,"I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant! The service was impressively quick, and the staff was exceptionally friendly. All the food items were freshly prepared and absolutely delicious. One of my friends had a headache and needed a Panadol, and the staff provided it promptly, which was very thoughtful. The ambiance was lovely, and the staff was incredibly attentive, even accommodating multiple requests from kids with great patience. The customer service here is truly top-notch. Highly recommended!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101425401615081671909/reviews
Rum Monteiro,5,"All 18 of us had a wonderful time breaking our Ramadhan fast at Manzanita. The staff were accommodating, polite n ever willing to help n serving us  with delight. The food was absolutely amazing. Every dish has its freshness n so tasty. The beef salad n beef stew were my favourite. My main, the pan seared Norwegian Salmon is unrivaled. Shout out to our ever friendly server Aung Hsan, the Assistant Captain in aiding us in a birthday celebration also. And  making our dining experience so memorable.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108419989675798207962/reviews
Terry Chua,4,"At first glance, everything wowed me when I stepped into the place. Brightly lit and everything was attractive and tempting. Took a seat and ordered. That was when things started to not go so well.

Food was ok but took quite a long time to arrive. Not sure how many staff was there, but they didnâ€™t seem to be a rush. Dirty cups and stuff were piling up.

Also bought some pastries to take away. Wasnâ€™t really tasty. Looked better than how they tasted.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114779419389907602398/reviews
