This is a gem spot to find affordable Chinese mala dish in the marina area.\n\nThe only downsize is it is takeaway only which is okay if you are on the go or live nearby!\n\nI ordered the spicy beef noodle (medium was perfect for me not too spicy) üçú and vegetable and pork dumplings ü•ü ! Both was great and I will be coming back to this üíé spot!",

Ask the Indian lady which menu should I look as there‚Äôs two menu, she ignore me so I look at the menu and assumed I can order from the menu that says Tuesday special. When I order, the Chinese lady says look at another menu which I ended up choose from the menu, then it‚Äôs says Tuesday bento so I assumed everything is preset. After that, only I notice I have to pick my own side dishes. Next moment, the Indian lady stare at me say so which one you want with a rude tone. Then after I chose then she packed and leave it on the counter top and proceed to do her stuff.\n\nI‚Äôm a new customer, how am I suppose to know Tuesday special don‚Äôt serve on Tuesday.\n\nSide note, I‚Äôm the only customer when I was there. It wasn‚Äôt a busy time or peak hour.\n\nPicked potato slice as my side dish but turn out to be sourish, like spoilt taste too. The rest was ok",

      "text": "There is usually a snaking queue at this place so I decided to try it since I do have a weakness for mala flavoured anything. Queue was very long but moved fairly fast.\n\nThey stopped selling noodles and only have a list of options that comes with rice that varies by day\n\nOrdered the chicken and you get to pick 3 sides. There weren‚Äôt many options with the sides, you already get rice but there was one option of glass noodles and another kuay teow. I ended up with 2 tofu and one veggie. Wish there were more greens options.\n\nThe mala tofu was too starchy. The steamed tofu was good and the chicken was decent.\n\nI do feel like $12.30 (50 cents extra for brown rice) is a tad to expensive for chap chai png style though.",
