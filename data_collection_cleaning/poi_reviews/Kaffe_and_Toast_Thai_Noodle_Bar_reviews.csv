Faye Yap (叶栩绯),5,"Honestly I don’t get the hate in the other reviews, I find their food really amazing for its affordable price.

Their signature boat noodles cost about $8.90. The soup is rich and flavourful, although the garlic skins does get in the way of you enjoying the soup towards the end.

I ate here around 8pm on a Wednesday so there wasn’t much of a crowd and it was a pretty chill place to dine.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101750484940912874032/reviews
Phoebe,2,Have ordered from here quite frequently (usually laksa or the beef boat noodles) throughout the past few years. Their meat quality seems to have dropped. Found a piece of bone INSIDE the meatball (I bit into it). Definitely not ordering again.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117513888294579647786/reviews
