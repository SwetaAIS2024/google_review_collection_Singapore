Leong Shangyuan Stanley,1,"Owner please do improve your facility. The location is not easily accessible. The prawning pond is full of seaweed and dirty. Baits not fresh, Crew are not helpful. The price we paid not worth it.  Only one time, that it.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117757106251955131166/reviews
Sean Mark,1,"I don't know where to start with this place... üòÇ

But I'll keep it short and simple, if you're planning on having one of the worst experiences for dinner or prawning, then this is surely the place for you.. A good place to end a break-up with that guy or girl who keeps bugging you. If you're a married couple, then it's a perfect place to end your relationship. If you're intending on bringing your kids, your kids might just disown you üòÇüòÇüòÇ.. just avoid.. trust me..

UPDATE: I thought I give a detailed review as well, my experience with the burgers, queues were rather long but the burgers were decent. We had the nasi lemak, honestly it was alright. The real issue was the people working behind the counters serving food were just slow and there wasn't a system in place. I didn't know if they would call out our order or just keep going up to ask if the order is ready.. it was just a mess to be honest.

There was a steamboat style of dining, but the selection wasn't appetising.

The food here is a case of ""cleap doesn't mean good.""

Prawn fishing - we wanted to get rods, but as soon as I got to the counter,  I heard some
people arguing with the guy at the counter as there were literally no catches!

Lastly, the toilet is perhaps one of the worst public toilets I've been. However, you can easily find it since you can smell it from about 10ft away ü§≠. Location- this is really isolated, good luck with getting a grab if you're not driving. If you are driving, there's a car wash near the parking lots. I didn't try that, but because we sat nearby watching the guys work, we were spont on to give it a miss. This is one of the weirdest places that had much hype in the start but was disappointing. Hopefully, things improve üôè

Thank me later!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100097197278132491830/reviews

Loewe Ong,4,"went here for prawning. prices are relatively cheap. but there are different types of rods, some are heavy and stiff, some are soft. hard to catch prawns as they keep eating the bait only. went for 2 hours with 3 people in total but only caught 4 prawns in total. but the staff is nice so 4 stars",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105984439419225600935/reviews
