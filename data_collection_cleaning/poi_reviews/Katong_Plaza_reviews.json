Mostly offices and empty shops, not a place I'd shop around in full transparency. Carpark is also simply functional, but also extremely run down.",

The Thai ice tea tasted strange and sour, so I went back to return it to the stall.\n\nThe store assistant couldn't speak English, and she didn't seem to understand when I told her to taste the Thai tea herself, to test whether it has gone bad.\n\nFood hygiene seems to be poor for the drinks... I hope this helps someone to avoid a bad stomachache.",
