Ximeng Zheng,1,"I have no idea why an internet banking does not have digital solutions to close Paylah! account. I have no idea why the Paylah account was still working that I cannot login my account in case of my DBS account had been closed. Does your bank have any logic to allow the account running but donot provide the access to the customer? Otherwise, there is no option in your app to close the Paylah! account and DBS online bank had so many bugs before. Really disappointed with your banking system which I never contacted in any other countries before.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113990453804978522592/reviews
Bryan Chen,5,Good to know that this ATM or Autolobby is situated across from Jason's Deli.  Hope it helps you find your way here especially if you need to exchange for CNY new notes. Otherwise most of the many DBS POSB ATMs inside MBS Shoppes will be able to serve your needs quickly.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105104810219467738675/reviews
Saifullah Juhari,1,"Unfriendly staff and has a very complicated online procedure to open a simple savings account. I spent a lot of time trying to open a bank account with them, in the end, it was rejected by a sms and was asked to re-apply online which will take a lot of time. The rejection was due to a ridiculous reason which is a mismatch address between the form and the supporting document in which I think the bank could easily fix. Please improve your procedure of service. A call to the customer would be more appreciated rather than a simple sms notification. I have worked in many places around the world and have opened bank accounts in those countries, and I am very dissappointed to say that this bank gave me the worst experience so far.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117322354949222060997/reviews
vivi zhuang,1,"Only two queue in front of me but waited for 29mins, plus the staff attended to me very unftiendly and no eyes contact..

The counter staff told me that next time press the business queue instead of personal queue number coz the cheque is a business cheque, my friend told her that we doesn't know coz there isn't any bank staff there to assist us, she can replied us that..
'even though there isn't any staff to assist you guys, you guys should know that this is a business cheque ah?'

What kind of attitude is that?",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105084125030545399506/reviews
