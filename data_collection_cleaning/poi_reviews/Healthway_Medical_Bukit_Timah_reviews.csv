Jade Tan,5,"Receptionist was lovely and made the process of registering quick and painless.

Doctor that we saw was friendly and professional. I brought my 9yr old daughter to see him today (so sorry I didn't catch your name!) and he was speedy with diagnosing the problem as well as had a great bed side manner that made my daughter feel at ease. Thank you!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113988457781681439830/reviews
