Ron Yang,4,"The skewered meats were cooked to perfection - itâ€™s a must try!

The dumplings are also popular. They are meaty and can be very filling. Be careful how many you order.

Service was great. Recommended.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104960568279362160422/reviews
Joey C.,5,"I have walked by this place many times and because of location I hav always thought it caters mostly to tourist. So when my local friends said we were coming here I was a bit surprised. To
My surprised not only was the food quite good but also affordable with somewhat generous portions for the price. So if you are in Chinatown this is a good option and ignore all the tourists. ðŸ˜¬",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117248916812976885999/reviews
Mimo Eats,3,"Affordable Chinese Food with High Variety but Mixed Quality

This spot offers a wide variety of affordable Chinese dishes and is always bustling with locals and tourists alike. The portions are generous, and the atmosphere is lively. Their standout items are the meat skewers, roasted with spices reminiscent of the Chinese Muslim cuisine from Xiâ€™an. The service is fast and efficient, keeping up with the busy crowd.

However, the overall food quality left something to be desired. The chicken popcorn portion was too small and overwhelmed by chili, making the dish unbalanced. While the skewers were decent, they lacked spice and any memorable flavors. The sweet and sour pork was overcooked, too hard to enjoy, and drowned in an overly sweet sauce.

The best dish we tried was the dumplings, which were juicy and flavorful, though the skin could have been thinner for a better texture.

Overall, itâ€™s a good spot for variety and affordability, but the quality of the dishes could be improved.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109251384615992579089/reviews

andytanhw,5,"This random restaurant we chose for lunch turned out to be a great choice. Every dish we ordered tasted delicious & were very reasonably priced. The lamb & pork skewers were great, Hunan chicken, four season beans, cabbage pork dumplings were all very well done.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110140375748483396091/reviews
