Venny Juliana,5,"Stumbled upon this small vegetarian stall at B1 of Katong Shopping Centre. It‚Äôs located outside the old food court area, near banana pie stalls.

The fried kwayteow very nice, have wok hey aroma and have nutty flavor in it. Trully hidden gem for vegetarian in katong area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114070569380434404874/reviews
