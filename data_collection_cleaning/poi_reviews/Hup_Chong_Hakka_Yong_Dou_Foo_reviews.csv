Jeremy Ho,4,"Been here many times but the last visit was probably 1-5 yrs ago.

Iâ€™m here for my favourite fried meat balls but Iâ€™m disappointed this time round . The taste no longer the same , really missed the good old taste.

If you like YTF , this is the place but for those fried stuffs it no longer the same.

I will still come back but will skip the fried meatballs.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110275270500014613437/reviews
Super Fragrance,3,"80cents of each pieces.

It was okay. On the cheaper side. I thought they will fry everything but they didn't. But the fried items are definitely tastier. The rate pink intestine really isn't as tender as braised, nor was it nicer.

The soup i am kinda devided. On one hand it seems plain in a good way but it still feels dilited.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
elle ary,2,"Not the greatest experience here..

Yes there is variety but it is definitely not fresh during dinner time. No effort to refry some items..

Soup tasted like water and msg.. though we opted for the dry one

The ytf and chilli sauce is not bad tho, wouldnâ€™t mind if feeling healthi(er) and living around the corner.

Service is fast, but minimal effort.

The place is infested w houseflies, i find myself waving my hands while in eat for almost all of the times..

Defo wouldnâ€™t travel down, there are much better ytf out there at more affordable prices.

Dmg for 2 (10 pcs): $11.20",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117144285710491726128/reviews
