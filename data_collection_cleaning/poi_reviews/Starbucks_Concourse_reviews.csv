Nancy Smith,5,"Located in the lobby of the Concourse office building, this modest Starbucks can also be accessed from the outside via just one door. It can be quiet as well as busy, usually during office rush hours. Polite and pleasant staff!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115627911477457281524/reviews
E,1,"Starbucks, your online purchase is totally UNtrustworthy. My Visa transaction went through but your website did not send a confirmation of my purchase. It is also impossible to contact you. Messenger messages hardly get a reply, emails are even worse and your app contact brings you to some human across the 7 seas ðŸ¤¨
Starbucks, you really are unreliable.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111232500198094472801/reviews

pianized,3,"Itâ€™s a Starbucks! This outlet is situated within The Concourse, at ground level. Spacious and rather quiet, the place accomodates approximately 50 pax with only indoor seatings but large tables. You get the usual drink menu with choice of cakes/sandwiches that can be re-heated upon request. Suitable for meet ups or a short coffee break for nearby office folks. Service crews were friendly and serve time was fast.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116018259600273925205/reviews
Ian Hall,3,"It's a Starbucks, if you've never been to one, you must be the only one. Coffee is predictably average but I'll admit this is a nice place to sit down and relax, especially if it's raining and you're stuck. If you want good coffee then I suggest walking to Wakey Wakey nearby.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107849469659987279287/reviews
