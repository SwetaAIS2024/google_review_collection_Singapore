S T,1,"High DO NOT recommend. Was the only clinic still open, cos my usual doc had an emergency to rush to. Was wondering if the 1 star reviews were real and tried it for myself. Clinic staff seemed so done with their jobs as if they’re underpaid.

Had to get a tetanus shot for a small cut/abrasion by a very rusty metal wire, doctor didn’t bother asking much about it, didn’t check when was my last tetanus shot. What’s worse is she was seated on my right while she injected the left arm by STRETCHING across. Pulled out the needle at an angle and it hurt. 0 empathy and 0 passion as a doctor, which is honestly quite sad.

Would reco going to just care medical at Bedok mrt and skip this at all costs.

Update: injection site is super hot and swelling, I don’t even get these from all my vaccinations previously, even the flu one taken a week ago at a diff clinic had no issues. Yall should review the kind of staff and doctors you hire, if there’s no empathy then maybe they need to consider their career in health care.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111672445242201358169/reviews

risla punjula,1,"I visited this clinic for severe back pain that had been affecting me for days. Even sitting down and looking down hurt, and since I work 12-hour shifts, this pain has seriously impacted my daily life.

The clinic was supposed to start operations at 2 PM, but Dr. Andy Kong arrived about 20 minutes late. Despite my condition, his attitude felt dismissive, as if he just wanted to rush through the consultation and get it over with. I wasn’t there to get a free MC—I was genuinely in pain and needed proper medical attention.

Being late is already unprofessional, but treating a patient who is clearly in distress with such indifference is unacceptable. I do not appreciate this kind of service, especially when I was struggling just to sit and wait. A doctor should show more care and concern for their patients.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103338994375662592046/reviews

Fazil Aziz,1,This clinic took 2 hours plus to attend to 7 patients. Really not for those who needs urgent medical and should change their name from heartland to heartless. Worst clinic ever. If I can give half star. I would do that sia!,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105647059120372357182/reviews
