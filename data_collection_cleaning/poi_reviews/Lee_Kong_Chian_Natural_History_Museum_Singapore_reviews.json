      "text": "A well-maintained and impressive little museum tucked away on the NUS campus. Entry is $18 for resident adults, but it’s free if you visit during your birthday month or if you’re an NUS student or staff, which is a nice perk. The museum is on the smaller side—you can comfortably see everything in about an hour—but the exhibits are high quality, especially the towering dinosaur skeletons, which were a real highlight. It’s very educational, though not the most suitable for young kids. My 5-year-old daughter was frightened by some of the lifelike stuffed animals, and we noticed other young children reacting similarly. It's worth a visit for the unique displays, but do note that it’s a bit out of the way and not near other attractions.",

The exhibits are incredibly well-curated, especially the dinosaur fossils – they’re breathtaking up close. There’s so much to learn about Southeast Asian biodiversity, from rare plants and animals to marine life and geology. The layout is spacious and thoughtfully designed, making it easy to navigate and enjoy at your own pace. Perfect for both kids and adults. Highly recommended for anyone interested in nature, science, or just looking for a unique experience in Singapore!",
