At 10:53am, I ended my consultation with Dr Kenneth who was knowledgeable and showed thoughtfulness for his patients. Then at 10:58am, I collected my medicine and made payment and went my way home.\n\nIn and out of the clinic in 20 minutes with diagnosis and medication collected. Quite efficient if you ask me. Sure you can always expect/demand a higher standard of service, but I think today’s experience served my needs reasonably.",
