Yu Qiang Heng,5,"Ijan and Zack (mechanic) were really friendly and accommodating when I went for their 1 hour trial session. They gave great, insightful tips about basic kart fundamentals and what to look out for when out on the track.
They also recorded videos of me on track, giving advice on the line choices and braking markers, which were really useful and definitely cut down my time because of that! Will definitely come back to you guys again üôèüèª",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114929820859850096649/reviews

Hasyrina Famf,5,We had a really good first trial experience with GTracing and it‚Äôs safe to say we will be coming back! Ijaan is so attentive and he has a way to guiding children on the track. My 10 year old son enjoyed his time on the track so much and made 30 seconds improvement of track time within one trial! It‚Äôs amazing. The karts are also in good conditions and well maintained. Thank you Ijaan and team for the passion and commitment you portray in this sport! :),2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107462456226398635709/reviews
