      "text": "We came here on mother’s day and it did not disappoint! Quality of the food here was superb and exceeded expectations - To my surprise, I enjoyed certain food items that I don’t typically like, such as fried fish, among others. The variety of food and desserts was also quite extensive and all the teochew porridge essentials were definitely available, with some bonus dishes. Dessert wise, there was a selection of 4 fruits, 3 sliced cakes, red bean soup, mango sago and 2 flavours of freshly scooped ice cream (not the frozen packaged ready to eat kind) - thai milk tea and cookies and cream. All the desserts were pretty good but the ice cream took me by surprise as both flavours were really good! Drinks wise, they offer english tea, coffee and water.\nThe staff were very attentive and polite, and the overall experience was very pleasant.\n\nFor the dinner buffet, they offer 2 seatings (90min each): 5.30-7pm and 7.15-8.45pm. We opted for the latter.\nThe only downside to this meal is that they were very strict with the buffet timings. By 8.30 or so, we were asked to settle the bill. By 8.45pm or earlier, they started clearing the buffet stations already and by 8.50/55, we were reminded of the need to vacate the tables for their closing. We rushed our food down and left by around 9pm or so. So just take note in case you expected a lax buffet timing like we did.\n\nThe weekday buffet pricing is $22.80++. Fri, Sat, Sun & PH : $25.80++. But on special occasions like today, it is $28.80++, which is a fair markup. Will probably be back again!",

We had the teochew porridge buffet. Very simply and traditional teochew porridge dishes like lor bah, cabbage, salted eggs, etc. but they were truly comforting, good with a bowl of white porridge. Service was attentive and prices reasonable.",
