na nashi (huilian),5,"We ordered had some omakase at the beginning because we didn't know what to order. Owner is very friendly and welcoming to introduce us on which sake to drink, what food to go with the sake. The staff is extremely friendly too. Owner's idea of the shop is alcohol first, community second, food third. While I'm not sure if the owner would be happy to hear this, but the food was great! We will try other sake the next time, adjusting to what we had this time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109065112149763472244/reviews
Lee Jianxing,5,"When I first stepped into this bar, I feel like I’m stepping into a part of Japan. Whenever I found a place filled with Japanese, it must have meant either the food is nice, the food is authentic or both. I feel over here, it’s both.

I had an awesome experience yesterday night, and was greeted by very warm hospitality from the owner and the other patrons.

One thing that probably added to the great experience was allowing the owner to make recommendations, both the sake and the food.

So I had some very special food that I would never dream of trying, and they turn out to be very nice. There were dishes like shark heart and baby squid, and a third dish frankly I can’t remember what it was now (the meat ball looking dish).

And the highlight, I would say is still the sake which both my friend and I really enjoyed it very much. Will definitely return again",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117428599670885749288/reviews
Siqiang Yang,5,"Limited food options but delicious. We have this pork dish with bread and it’s so good! As there is only 1 wait staff and chef/ owner, pls be patient and wait for your food. You are also required to drink in order to dine in.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106543935855090828195/reviews
Derek Wallbank,5,"Phenomenal sake bar. Most sake places in Singapore are too atas. This is just right. It says it's an underground sake bar, and it is exactly that. In the most wonderful of ways.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115408090321523440951/reviews
Jonathan Chou,5,"The Japanese owner is a discerning individual who wholly embraces the sake culture at this little cosy izakaya.

He is very upfront that his sake comes first and foremost. The food, while delectable, are mostly light bar bites and are prepared for maximum enjoyment with sake.

He regularly cultivates relationships with breweries back in Japan. Sake selections are seasonal and you will be able to sample sakes that are only available for a limited time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111410888330115052454/reviews
