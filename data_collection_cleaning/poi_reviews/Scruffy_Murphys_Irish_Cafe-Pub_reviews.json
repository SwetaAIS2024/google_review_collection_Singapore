      "text": "It is a pub and I really enjoy the English (irish) pub ambience and looks of this place. Not all the dishes are great but the fish & chip is to die for. Fresh tasting fish on light crispy beer battered. The portion is big too. The mushy pea is yummy.  A lot of draft beer to choose from and their monthly beer of the month promo is pretty good priced. On top of it all, all the prices are nett and the prices are reasonable. This is my regular haunt. üòÄ",

Very yummy food and of course good beer for those who are beer lovers.\n\nRather quiet at lunch and afternoon but a little pack at dinner and weekends.  Overall,  a recommended place to go if you are near the area.  Parking is limited right at the venue but you can find parking a little further,  need walking but manageable.",
