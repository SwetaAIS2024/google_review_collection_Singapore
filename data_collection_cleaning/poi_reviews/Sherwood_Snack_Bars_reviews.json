On Wed and Sat they have special menu like laksa which was also nice, have a old school, ah-ma style taste to it. I like it! no wonder theres a queue - good food and good price. Only thing is limited tables especially at peak hours. Will try the recommended wonton mee next time.",

The wanton noodles is highly recommended. They now have a seating area in the open atrium which certainly heightened the dining experience. Try it and you will come back again!",
