Stephanie Hale,1,"We came here with the high expectations. But I was totally disappointed. The food was below average.

Please note that if you are coming for the dinner, no one cooks your food. Everything is prepared as there are no cooks/chefs for the dinner.

The food is below average. There many better Indian options in the area. You should try other restaurants.

The waiters dress very badly and look dirty. Their hygiene standards are very low.

Dennis N,5,"Well well well, truly coming here for a meal is an experience! Service is amazing as they check on us often and give helpful recommendations. Especially at the end they just gave us desserts even after we declined ordering. Service aside; the food is AMAZING! Rich, tasty and a whole chunk of well made dishes. Almost everything I tried was above average and especially good was: Chicken Tikka Masala, Samosas & Muttom Dum Briyani. Really amazing and I would be back! üíØ",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104988888938292694772/reviews
