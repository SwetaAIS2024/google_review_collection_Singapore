      "text": "Surprised by the high ratings. Decent portion of noodles with texture thicker than mee kia but doesn't qualify as the typical thinner, springy wonton noodles. Char siew a little dry. Would have preferred thicker, dark toasted tender char siew. Sauce again was in between fishball noodles and wonton sauce. Lack a fragrant sesame scent or taste. Soup base very blend and lack flavour. Wonton itself was good though. I've had better wonton noodles in gombak area and even bukit batok east ave 4. My faves would be ones in telok blanglah drive, chomp chomp serangoon gardens and tampines west..",

Good amount of pork and chestnut.\n\nIts pricing is very attractive and offers great CP proposition.",

      "text": "Visited on a weekend morning, stall had a few customers. The stall itself is pretty small, 2 seats within and 3 tables outside.\n\nOrder the standard wanton mee ($3.80). Came with a decent amount of noodles, around 7 pieces of lean char Siew and 3 boiled wantons.\n\nNoodles:\nNoodles were drenched in a watery chilli sauce blend and probably some soy based sauce.\n\nThe noodles were the thicker kind which gives you a better bite. My issue with the noodles is that it had a very strong alkaline taste, which wasn't covered by the sauce and green chilli taste.\n\nWanton/Char Siew:\nWanton skins were thick and felt pretty dense. Skin was not the silky soft kind that floats on the soup. Rather felt like those 中国水饺 kind, definitely a miss for me. Meat amount was alright but I didn't really like the taste of the meat.\n\nChar Siew is the standard lean meat 'cardboard' kind. But they did give a generous amount for a $3.80 portion. Not too thin.\n\nOverall, slightly below average for me. Noodles and wantons could be better. But guess it is a somewhat decent food option around this area since there is almost nothing to eat at sunshine place.",

I went to search on Google, seems like the quantity of Char Siew is similar to Wanton Noodles without wanton. However, they still dare to charge consumers $4 per packet and tell me the char siew is already a lot. I am very disappointed as I used to be a regular.",
