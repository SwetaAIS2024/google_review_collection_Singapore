Cahaya Ilahi,5,"I come from Indonesia. I want to eat Nasi Padang. I saw a shop called Cry Stingray at the Teban Garden market. I'm curious to try rendang, black sotong cooking, and spicy sour. It turns out it's really delicious, solid and delicious",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116570358323792563006/reviews
CCS,3,"Besides it's screaming signboard, there aren't much to shout about their food.

Supposedly their super spicy stingray bring tears to customers eyes. The question is: do you REALLY WANT that in the morning?

Perhaps they have their fan base but over the last five years since I started coming to the Teban market, I have yet  to see ant long queues or crying customers.

Maybe I am not there at the right time. But they still around. That means business can't be bad",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
