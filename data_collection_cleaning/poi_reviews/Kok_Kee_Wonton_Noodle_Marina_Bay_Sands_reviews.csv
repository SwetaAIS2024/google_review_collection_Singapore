Ba Banana,5,"Wonton mee set meal - $10.80

Surprisingly good quality meal for foodcourt in a mall.
This might be consider expensive but definitely not in mbs mall.

Meat is tender, no fatty part (I like), noodle is chewy, gravy/sauce is not too think or salty.

Counter aunty was quite friendly.

I’d go back again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100993474974008065411/reviews
Melanie E,5,"If you love home cooking and love wonton this is a must place to visit.

Food: 5/5 they offer deep fried wontons along with wontons in soup. If you’re not a meat eater, there’s noodles with vegetables. They also have their signature dishes for one person. I had the basic wonton in soup. The broth was perfect and tasty. Just like the way my mom used to make them.
Service: 5/5 - friendly and prompt
Atmosphere: 4/5 they’re located in the basement of the food court at Marina Bay shopping area.

It’s the best wonton soup I have had in ages.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136896090209853190/reviews
Vy Yang,4,"I really want to order a combo of noodle with bok choi but they ran out :, but the noodles are really good though!

The price is decent. The eating space is really crowded so make sure to secure a space before ordering.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112725556258245187890/reviews
Kai Ng,5,"This is located in shoppes at Marina bay food court.

I chose set C(cheapest of three sets and includes sample of two sides—choy vege and fried wonton along with their signature BBQ pork wonton (dry) noodle. The give a little broth on side when you choose dry

The bbq pork was Amazing 5/5 stars
Noodles were also Al dente perfect with bit of green.  The sauce of bbq pork was draped over noodles made it perfect.

Wonton were ok 2.5/5
Fried wonton less good 2/5
Vege perfect 4/5
Broth  not memorable (either bbq pork sauce then it’s great) 2/5

Highly recommend bbq and noodles and vege. Wonton not recommended",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105345469072974394760/reviews
