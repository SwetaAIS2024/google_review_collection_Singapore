edwin,5,"Easily one of the best Korean restaurants in Singapore. The food is incredibly flavorful, and the value for money is insane. We got a set for about $50, and the portion size is massive—definitely more than enough for several people. I always end up dabaoing leftovers.

The jjajangmyeon is top-tier, but I was also really impressed with the jjampong and the side dishes, which have improved a lot since I last visited years ago. Now they even serve egg omelette and tteokbokki on the side—what a surprise!

Also wanted to give a shoutout to the super friendly Indian female staff—great energy and service. Actually, all the staff here are lovely.

And just to be clear—I’m leaving this review because it’s that good, not because of the free Häagen-Dazs you get for reviewing.

Pro tip: Go during non-peak hours, around 8–9 PM, just after dinner. Otherwise—CONFIRM NO SEATS!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109891667258604967057/reviews
Qian Ting Young,5,"Nice music playlist. We also received good service from Mandeep. He grilled the 5mm pork belly nicely -  crispy on the surface and the right amount of tenderness inside the meat and offered to make us a wrap to demonstrate how to eat the pork belly with the seasoning and sauces. He and a few other staff who served us are also attentive, asking if we need refills of the side dishes when they notice we were finishing them.  Highly recommend to order the 5mm pork belly BBQ! The accompanying side dishes are also yummy.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110777243771658833563/reviews
Fiona Lim,5,"Long heard about that fantastic bbq and long queues. The beef and pork were decent. The side dishes were splendid. Really like the kimchi here, egg roll, sausage and some other pickled veggies. Oh, we ordered set 1 and it includes rice balls. The rice was served in a bowl and you have to mix and kinda roll them in the bowl yourself. The service was very attentive. I like to have my meat barbecued for me. At one point they ran out of the sausages and the lady who served us, Mina offered something equally yummy as a top up. :) a while later, she even gave us our sausages when the kitchen made more. Really good service! Overall we enjoyed our time here.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109212672263057012484/reviews
류창선,5,It taste 100% as the ones I had back in Korea. I was kinda late while my friend ordered it for me. So my jjajang noodle was a bit mushy. I didn’t even ask them but then they gave us a free jjajangmyeon for free as a service and it was really touching and a heart warming experience for me. I give 5+++ for this cuisine.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108145361771767258248/reviews
Wendy Au,5,Love the authentic Korean food. Generous servings and lots of variety. The server would automatically offer to refill the sides.  Great place for casual gathering. Good to come with a few people to be able to sample more dishes.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102628812322024738550/reviews
