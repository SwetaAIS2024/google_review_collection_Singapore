pam,5,"Tried the udon set here ! I was just craving udon so bad so I came and ate here lol. Itâ€™s a set with tamago and honestly itâ€™s pretty good ! Didnâ€™t take long for my food to come cause I ate at 3pm and I was the only person eating there ðŸ˜‚ came with a side of salad as well. A bit pricy, I paid about $16.67 so might not be the cheapest ðŸ¥² the food is not too bad tho !",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103268714869998759401/reviews
Sunny J,3,"Large portion is just standard size of others.
This price almost same like the one in central area.
However the standard of taste is not there..
So Not really worth $60 for 2pax :(

More I eat, I felt unfresh taste of sashimi..

Fred C.,5,"Loved it! Taste awesome and the portion is generous, although the bowl look kinda small. We ordered the set meal for 2 and find it most value for money. As there are not many tables, advisable to visit during odd hour. Highly recommended.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111367868160854186967/reviews

Kevin Ang,5,Cute little place serving fresh sashimi on rice with lots of sides to choose from as well. The  small number of seats really make it feel like eating in Japan. Good value for money based on the portion sizes.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247294128726535324/reviews
