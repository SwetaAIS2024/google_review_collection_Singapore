Christine Vergara,5,"Would like to give much thanks to Charles for ensuring my safety and being a lovely person. I was on the last train and overshot my stop, ending up at Gulf Circle past midnight without a train back, so I asked the service counter where to find the bus stop.  Charles stepped out however and accompanied me to the stop, even waiting for me to board the bus. He did so as he knew how dangerous it would be for a young girl like me at night. I felt extremely safe that night and grateful for his accompaniment. Thanks Charles and all the best to you!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106903638227680685908/reviews

Ma S,2,"I visited here when this station opened last year but the buildings around this station seems like a factory office and warehouse!
So I couldnâ€™t find any special but very quiet station:)",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101736631242777756594/reviews
