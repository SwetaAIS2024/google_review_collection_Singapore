      "text": "*Long review ahead*\n\nVisit with caution.\nI believe there are other better clinics.\nThe only good point is that my dentist is really gentle and patient.\n\nI wished the entire experience was pleasant.\n\nI started my Zenyum journey with the clinic on 1 Oct 2023 - 12 March 2025.\n18 MONTHS.\n\nAt the beginning of my treatment, I am told both by Zenyum and the clinic that my case is mild and as promised on their multiple platforms it should take around 3 months +/-. But it took 18 months.\n\nEven for complex cases it “may require up to 15 months” but my mild case (not complex) took 18 months.\n\nIn order for the teeth to move, the dentist had to file between tooth to create spaces for them to move and those spaces were unable to close up during the treatments. As per attached photos, after the treatment I needed 5 refinements.\n\nToday I visited the clinic for my end review for my 5th refinement to find out there were still 1 more gap they were unable to close. Under frustration, I gave up hope closing it and decided not to proceed with SIXTH refinements.\n\nMind you, for every refinements, the clinic needed to take a 3D scans of the teeth at your own cost $110+.\nIf I remembered correctly, I paid for the scans up till the 3rd refinements, the rest were covered either by the clinic/Zenyum.\nI got frustrated with the treatment and felt I should have to pay for their mistake because they couldn’t close the gap they opened.\nEvery refinement is supposed to close all the gaps, even after the 5th refinement I still have to live with 1 gap forever.\n\nTo add on, at my visit today, I have to do fillings.\nAs per attached photo, the clinic told me it is priced at $150/tooth. At the clinic, the dentist showed me the 4 fillings he did. 2 on 1 tooth, and on 2 other teeth. Doesn’t that make 3 teeth?\nThey charged me for 4 teeth because 1 tooth had 2 fillings.\n\nIt’s very misleading.\nI hope they were more transparent about it.\n\nWhen I told the receptionist about it, she said I still have to pay this price so she will just amend the invoice. I was shocked because I thought she meant to fabricate the description just to include the cost.\n\nAlmost every trip, all the receptionists have really bad service. They should not work in customer service industry.\n\nOverall I had a bad experience and just want this whole ordeal to end.",

I bought a set of toothpaste & brush , however  she didn’t check the goods and the toothbrush was missing from the set. I went back and checked, her nonchalant reply was “nah, you can have this set”, with no apologies for her mistake. Please send your front desk for basic customer service , the bad English and lack of proper reply left a bad experience to an otherwise pleasant trip",
