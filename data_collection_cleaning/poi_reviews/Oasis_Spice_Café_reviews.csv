Gopi Nallaiyan,4,"Self service Indian restaurant located opposite to the Revenge of the Mummy within the Universal studios. Only prepared rice items and curries available. Jain, vegetarian and non vegetarian combos are available. Dishes are average for the price paid. Both indoor and outdoor seating available.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117717395531505414734/reviews
Vanessa “VNEXXA” López-Vanegas,5,"considering that theme parks are the most FOMO-inducing places to have a meal (due to the plethora of highly-themed and attractive options at one's disposal), i completely understand if you're struggling to choose your food-spot-of-the-day while at universal singapore. let me ease your worries and direct you to oasis spice cafe — right across from this park's mummy clone (if the florida version ends up closing, let's all pray that this one stays intact). DELICIOUS eats at this shaded spot, away from the hustle and bustle right outside. food is served fast and fresh with a counter service style; order the mutton if you want an absolute BURST of flavour in your mouth. the samosas were also so so so unexpectedly good. don't let the singapore heat deter you from a heat-filled feast. the spice will cool you off !!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116882149733941403071/reviews
L AKi,5,The food is pretty good (butter chicken biryani was delicious) but the service leaves a little to be desired. A bit chaotic and if you order poppadoms for example you have to queue twice once for your curry and then again for your poppadoms. Weird. If you ask the staff who gave you the curry to give you the poppadoms they just stare at you blankly.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104386932061527505335/reviews

Ian Apostol,5,"We're from the Philippines and recently had the chance to try Oasis Spice Café — and we’re so glad we did! The food was full of flavor and absolutely delicious. Even though we’re used to different tastes back home, we truly enjoyed every bite. Great job to the chefs and the whole team! Highly recommended for anyone looking for tasty and satisfying meals.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106193358542321194308/reviews
