Jacob Mikey,1,"I hope Google map will create zero or negative star rating! This is one of the worst rojek I tried. It‚Äôs a super duper expensive like hotel charging. I opted for Ala carte rojek(wrong choice) add 1 yu tiao and 3 taopor and 1 Century egg. Yu tiao $2.50 per yu tiao, 1 tap por $1.3 and 1 century egg $1.50, the stall uncle asked me want vegetables and I said yes( biggest mistake) I was expecting $7.9 in the end turn up to be $12.9. The veg itself cost $5 and not much. I will never buy from the stall again. It cost too much for rojek. Even more expensive than food court large potion rojek (jurong jem food court). The overall taste so so don‚Äôt even justified the price.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109252454388118177841/reviews

First time trying this stall.
The display of fresh taupok attracted me. So I ordered 2 fresh taupok in addition to the $5 small rojak. Total is $7.60 ie each fresh taupok costs $1.30.

The fresh taupok definitely good üëç. The stale ones that come with the $5 rojak needless to say can‚Äôt be good.
The sauce is good.
Next time will just order the fresh ones. !",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116788322544213433170/reviews
Joshua Chew,5,One of the best rojak we ever had. The food ingredients were very fresh and not too salty. We bought the largest portion for $7 and we found the price reasonable. Service was very quick and aunty had a smile on her face which brightened our moods as well. This stall is highly recommended and you should definitely try it if you have not.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100928805220966571942/reviews
Alan Chan,1,$4 takeaway - portion is so little. There are some rojak stalls in Jurong East with more portion and same price. Most likely won‚Äôt buy from this store anymore. Bean sprouts taste raw. The other ingredients are ok,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110719132781492701972/reviews
