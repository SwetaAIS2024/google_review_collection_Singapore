      "text": "I recently visited this place with a friend who‚Äôs a regular, and she couldn‚Äôt stop praising it‚Äîand she was absolutely right!\n\nMy dog was a bit of a troublemaker during our visit üòÖ (almost knocked down a fence, diarrhoea-d on the floor, and even broke a plate and cup while moving around). Despite all this, the staff were incredibly kind and reassuring. They told me not to worry about the cost‚Äîeven though the plate looked quite expensive‚Äîand immediately checked to see if my dog was okay after the incident.\n\nThe food was fantastic for both humans and dogs! My dogs and I absolutely loved it. On top of that, they had a photo booth where we could take our own pictures and have them printed for free‚Äîa wonderful little touch.\n\nThe cafe also features a spacious area where dogs can run freely and interact with each other, which my pup thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nEvery detail in this cafe is so well thought out, from the friendly staff to the beautiful environment and even the adorable takeaway packaging for pets. To top it off, they even gave us a free gift! I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough‚Äîit‚Äôs truly a must-visit for all dog lovers!",

We'll be back!\"",

We love that the place was spacious and places that offers drink to our furbaby first is always a plus to the service.\n\nHam aglio olio $18ish. Requested for extra spicy and it turned out more peppery.\nBeer battered fish & chips $21ish.\nFood for humans was average, not worth the price in my opinion.\n\nThe meal for our pup was $14.80. Looks cute and he loves the meat and smoothie.",
