Ms Pearl has been teaching my friends‚Äô three boys for years, now aged 8, 6 and 4!\n\nMs Pearl is an amazing piano teacher. She is dedicated, nurturing, patient, talented and skilled in keeping my young daughter engaged throughout the entire duration of class. My daughter loves Ms Pearl and enjoys her weekly piano lessons!\n\nI highly recommend Ms Pearl. You do not have to worry about young kids‚Äô attention span for piano lessons as Ms Pearl is experienced and can improvise and keep children engaged and cultivate their passion for music! :)",
