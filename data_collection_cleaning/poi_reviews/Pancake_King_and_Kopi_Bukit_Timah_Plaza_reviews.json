They also have a wide range of other desserts and cakes to choose from. There are some seating available if you want to dine in with coffee being served as well. A nice spot for a quick treat or a casual snack break. The store is hidden at a back corner tho the sign is strategically placed to show through.",

For the price, expect to be better.\n\nService wise Q cleared pretty fast. Minimal renovation ambience but nice to have a cup of kopi here as its air conditioned.",

Peanut butter was ok, not too sweet but also not flavourful.\nCoffee was freshly grounded. Nice. I enjoyed the coffee more than pancake. There are better pancake elsewhere.",

The peanut filling was creamy and generously spread, while the Teh was a strong, flavourful brew served in the traditional rooster cup. Seating is limited but friendly patrons are generally willing to share tables. A cosy spot to satisfy your hunger or even take a quick meal break - they also sell packets of Nasi Lemak at around the $3 to $4 mark. All hail the Pancake King!",
