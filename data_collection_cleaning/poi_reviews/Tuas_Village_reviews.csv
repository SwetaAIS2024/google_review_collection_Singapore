Rajesh Kuan,3,A lot of food variety. Only drink stall very expensive for a hot tea at $1.50 and taste bland. The Lor Mee are still acceptable with big chunky pork.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110934531258946296528/reviews
Mohd Fajar Ahmad,4,"$4 Nasi Lemak! Looking at the portion given, it's a rare find! Came across this coffee shop and decided to have my Brunch here.. Saw a pax ahead of me left with Nasi lemak in his hands. Looks good. So decided to order it. Gave $10 to the Malay stall Kakak and received $6 back. Thought she returned me extra change... but it is actually only $4! It's a Nasi Padang stall. Maybe will try their nasi padang next.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109942920251686138498/reviews
