Mason Tay,5,It is very hot here in this hawker centre but everyone is still crowding around here. Ordered the ribeye steak cooked in medium well and apparently the steak tasted way better than COLLINâ€™s steak.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108195777674730720034/reviews
Lk Au,1,Chicken Cutlet cooked until burnt. Fries are so miserable.  1st and last time buying from this store,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117206368938818682296/reviews
xfool07,5,Decent portion size for the cheapest fish and chips I ever seen. It's also served really fast like less than 5 mins and the plate looks good. Not a fan of fries so not bothered by the small amount. Fries aren't healthy anyway and u can get a lot from fast food chains. It's not bad for $6 if you are looking for a lighter western meal.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114958226233464733140/reviews
DHeats Cheesecake,4,Ordered fish and chips at 5.50. The aunty told me to wait 7min to collect as there are a few orders in front of me. The fish and chips is normal standard. Probably could have provide more fries.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101131107208743411504/reviews
