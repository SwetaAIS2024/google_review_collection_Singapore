Er Hauzhi,5,"Very authentic China local flavour here!

There usually won't be a crowd there so seats are usually available, and it is easier to find parking here.

Soup-wise, quite a lot of flavour to choose from, from non-spicy type to hellish spicy.

Recommend to order deep fried egg together, it tastes so good when soaked into the soup.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101955805285849828672/reviews
