      "text": "Absolutely awful customer service. I bought my PXC550 headphones a few years ago and now it’s not working. I knew the warranty was over so I wasn’t expecting free service but I wanted to know what I could do to repair it. I booked an appt 3 weeks in advance. However, the day before the appt I got a call from the centre telling me that they don’t do repairs and there’s nothing they can do for me if my headphones are not under warranty anymore. They weren’t even willing to let me come in to let them have a look. Absolutely ridiculous. Never buying Sennheiser again.",

Your service is really bad. After waiting for almost 3 months,  and found way to go to Rayfield Electronic Technical Service  all are good in 10 mins. Thanks to fellow reviewer here.",

Best thing is that I kept this product for 2 years and only use it less than 10 times. Better off buying other brands like Sony or Jabra. Wasted my trip down to a service center and got thrown around to another company to handle.\n\nCheap China made ones can easily last longer then these so called premium luxury brands.",
