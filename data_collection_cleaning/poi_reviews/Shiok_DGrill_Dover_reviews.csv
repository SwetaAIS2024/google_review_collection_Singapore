Terence Chan,5,"Nice western food with friendly staff. The aglio w chicken is so tasty! I also asked for a standalone salad which is not available in the menu, impressed that the staff is helpful and flexible enough to bundle the salad & add a sunny side-up egg to it in order to match up with the charged bill (for cheese fries). üëç",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106934131194331641026/reviews
