teo richard,5,"Was recommended to have my OBU install at Jackspeed Auto, Gibson was very user centric in his recommendation in where’s the best place to install the cash card reader that suit the user needs. Very professional and efficient team, manage to finish the installation before schedule, they even took time to check on the condition of my vehicle. Highly recommended!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101911712092563038416/reviews
wanchenglim,5,"I decided to have my OBU installed at Jackspeed Auto after reviewing their services.
Ah Seng was very customer-focused in patiently recommending the best location for the cash card reader, considering my needs.
The team, especially Chong, was extremely skilled and effective, finishing the installation before the expected timeline.
Small hiccups on my side mirrors. ; )",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105661198439670971512/reviews
Rachel Tan,1,"The customer service is shockingly horrible. Please don’t be scammed by the other 5 star reviews you see. The “lady boss” named Yvonne has no basic respect and will treat you worse than a dog. She spoke to us with attitude and shouted at us even when it is a simple query. This was not the first time.

I am aghast that the BOSS of Jackspeed Automobile has such foul and horrible attitude. My family and I will definitely not go to Jackspeed Automobile again and neither should any of you. There are so many automobile shops out there. It’s not worth being yelled at as a customer for no reason here.

Highly do not recommend.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115560434350666565073/reviews
KD Sunil,5,"Extremely impressed with this Mechanic Ah Seng. Really good with hsi nimble fingers and small frame, he was able to manoeuvre and get the OBU installation done in about 50mins. However the waiting time to get the Job done even with my appt was at 8.30am. They only managed to start work at 10.03am. Do go to their workshop if you can afford to wait. The Japanese and Korean Car's are much easier to i stall FYI. Thanks Ah Seng and Jack Speed. You have a Great Mechanic here.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106979774114734906677/reviews
Raxton Ng,5,"I recently patronized Jackspeed and I'm thoroughly impressed by Gibson. His professionalism, attention to detail, and dedication to delivering top-notch service truly stood out.
Gibson kept me informed every step of the way. He explained the issues, recommended the necessary repairs, and ensured that everything was done to perfection.
The work was completed efficiently, and my car is now running smoother than ever. I'm extremely satisfied with the service I received and would highly recommend Gibson at Jackspeed to anyone seeking reliable, trustworthy, and expert car care.
Gibson, thank you for your outstanding work! You're a true asset to the team!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116402823734399676803/reviews
