Lilian Wong,1,"Been using this Goodwill ambulance for the last 4 visits for my father‚Äôs medical appts and the services were okay but most of the time the pick-up to the appts were always late and we have to call to remind them on booking.  However, today the services were the worst. Our advance booking for pick up at 7am and requested for a stretcher as it is a day surgery appt at 7.30 am in Tan Tock Seng Hospital. However, They came late with no stretcher at 7.20 am. They mentioned that Goodwill admin staff gave them wrong information on booking. We managed to leave only at 7.30am . So we arrived late for our day surgery at 7.50am. And the return trip booking when we called - they wanted us to wait 3 hrs .. why ?? They are busy for the day:( No more goodwill for our future appts .",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103883418557797065320/reviews
Subra Maniam,5,"An awesome outstanding service.

Certainly a five star ‚ú® service.

All details from A to Z were taken care of by Merrill Mathew and his team when recently a friend was airlifted in an ambulance (air ambulance) from Penang to Singapore.

Grateful to such an amazing team, especially when the loved ones are at a lost when encountered with such a traumatizing situation.

May they be blessed.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102440824734603024614/reviews

B Light,1,"Staff in the ambulance failed to drive slowly. Was more in a hurry to arrive at the hospital although there wasn't any emergency. Staff did not even check the patients oxygen level and blamed me instead for not alerting her. As mum does not need oxygen, I chose not to inform them",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114672027776830191119/reviews
