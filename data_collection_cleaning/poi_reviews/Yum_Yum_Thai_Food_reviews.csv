Where Yiu Going,4,"The staff are so nice and friendly! However quite unfortunately Thai basil rice I got wasn't very good, the meat was soggy and not what I expected

I'm sure the other food choices are better tho so maybe get the soups instead of the basil rice",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114103706220466531028/reviews
