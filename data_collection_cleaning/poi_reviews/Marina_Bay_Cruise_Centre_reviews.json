      "text": "Horrible experience with aggressive staff member yelling at my family for requesting to join the wheelchair queue going on the Genting Cruise. He kept shouting only one carer with wheelchair is allowed. So my father is being punished for having 2 carers and not being allowed to the wheelchair priority queue. Later on, my father was taken away and wheeled to the priority queue with a wider gantry while we were shuffled through 2 separate queues. It was so confusing throughout and staff members were generally dismissive rather than providing genuine help to wheelchair bound customers and their families.",

      "text": "The public car park at the Marina Cruise Center could benefit from better management. According to the valet, over 70 slots on level three are reserved for cruise passengers only. If that’s the case, it would be helpful to adjust the available slot display on level two to reflect this. Currently, drivers are going up, only to be informed that those spots aren’t for public use, causing confusion and extra work for the valet, who has to explain the situation repeatedly.",

      "text": "Terrible experience at the Marina Bay Cruise Centre. Our cruise check-in time was 1pm and we arrived early around 11am, the staff told us we can’t check in until 1. But around 12pm, they opened up for everyone to check-in regardless the designated check-in time. Everyone rushed to queue up and the line started all the way outside the building at the middle of the road. The instruction was so confusing and the staff are very rude. While waiting, there was no space for us to even stand comfortably, and the staff keep yelling at us asking us not to block the way whilst there was no waiting area whatsoever to cater for the crowd. The traffic outside was also chaos, crowd walking in between buses and the signboard to the check-in location is also unclear.",
