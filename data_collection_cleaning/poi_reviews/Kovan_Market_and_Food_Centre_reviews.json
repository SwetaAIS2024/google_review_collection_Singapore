So do have some patience.\n\nFood was amazing. Noodles has pork lard inside, the tasty anchovies soup has a generous portion of veggies and meat. A very satisfying meal indeed.\n\nDo give it a try.\n\nEdit: they up-ed their game by adding in an egg and mushrooms into the soup !ü§§üò©‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nÈÖøË±ÜËÖêstall serves delicious food too !",

The soup was robust and didn‚Äôt leave me feeling thirsty.\n\nI ordered at 1230 and waited about 15 minutes in line, still worth it! Shiok so definitely coming back for more!\n\nKovan Hawker Centre also has a great variety of other yummy food options to explore. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "Chanced upon this newly opened stall selling mee siam and curry puffs. Friendly stallholders. Told me they just opened for about 2 months. Pleasantly surprised that gravy is thick, tangy and not diluted like other stalls. Reminds me of traditional grandma‚Äôs home cooked mee siam. Portion and ku chai are also generous. They also sell homemade curry puff which is full of ingredients with chicken meat at $1.80 each. The stall holder taught me to dip the curry puff into the mee siam gravy for a different experience. I enjoyed my food so much that I forgot to take photos of my food. Really impressed with the quality of their mee siam and curry puffs. Rare to find such authentic nice mee siam nowadays. This is real hawker food and not those franchise type which is common in hawker centers nowadays.",

      "text": "First time here and was introduced to the fried kway teow, satay and the flamed chicken wings.\n\nTo start the fried kway Teow tasted healthier than I expected. It wasn‚Äôt too salty. It wasn‚Äôt too sweet and it wasn‚Äôt too sweet. Just a nice blend of flavor as well as tenderness of the noodles. A delightful a great dish to start with.\nOn the satay, the meat was tender, easy to rip off from the stick. The peanut sauce was nice. It wasn‚Äôt over powering with the peanut taste not too oily as well. It was a nice mixture with the meat on my taste palette. highly recommended\n\nMoving on to the chicken wing\nNicely grill no char area. Easy to rip off the meat from the bone. had a good time as I do not need to wrestle with the chicken wing to chew off the meat from the bone\n\nAnd finally not forgetting the youji duck.\nI ordered half a duck.\nI am always happy with the quality of the duck meat\nA great dish to compete a wonderful night of dinner üôÇ",

      "text": "First time eating at this hawker and I went to ÁÇ≠ÁÉ§ÈªëÂèâÁÉß or Charcoal Grilled Charred Roast Meat (#01-40). For $4.50 in January 2025, served to me in under 3 minutes, I'm surprised this store isn't getting a Bib Gourmand.\n\nLittle introduction to roast meat stores here. Meats offered normally include two styles of pork belly/fattier cuts like shoulder. First, the ÁÉßËÇâ or siew yuk, a crispy roast pork belly, second, the ÂèâÁÉß or char siew, pork shoulder or belly roasted in a sweet/savoury glaze. Typically, shops like these also sell ‰∫ëÂêû or wantons with shrimp and pork filling as alternatives or add-ons to the roast meat, plated on a serving of the main carbohydrate, either thin egg noodles or rice, alongside some ËèúÂøÉ or choy sum.\n\nWhat's different about this stall is they roast their meats over charcoal, an increasingly popular trend amongst shops like these, catering to those who crave that charred smoky taste reminiscent of a brisket. This stall does it well; each bite of the char siew meat is balanced, not overly fatty or dry. It is on the slightly sweeter side of char siew, owing to a less savoury glaze.\n\nThe winner was the attention to detail for me. Wantons, usually given less recognition than the roast meats, were filled with juicy pork and shrimp filling, unlike the limp sacks of wanton skin most stalls offer. The soup, often skipped by customers due to the overdose of MSG to be expected, was surprisingly nourishing; mine had a cube of daikon inside a savoury and peppery broth that complimented the sweeter char siew. The chili is not just your usual MSG laced garlic chili blend either, there are dried shrimp inside, sweet, savoury and well-matched to the umami of the soy sauce noodles. Expect free servings of spring onions, pork crackling, and chili too.\n\nAnother thing to add is the store's layout. It is a rather open concept, owing to the lack of the usual glass panel display where the roast meats are hung. Why? One can hazard 2 guesses, either the meats are so popular they have to keep roasting them or not hanging them ensures the juices don't dry out over the day. Either way, you get a constant supply of fresh roast meat.",
