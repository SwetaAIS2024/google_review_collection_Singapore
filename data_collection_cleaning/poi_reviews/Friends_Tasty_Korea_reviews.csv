Alex Tan,5,"Had to bring my wife out for mothers day but we were too busy to make plans. Saw many people eating here, we decided to try and queue. The Korean owner was quite tired from the big crowd yet he managed to give us a friendly hello. We waited about 20mins and he gave us a table. Due to limited gas stove on the outdoor tables, the meats were grilled for us. This is very useful as it allowed them to cook it expertly and we can just use proceed to eat. We had the family set at $130. Added teobboki, jajangmian, Cass beer and some soft drinks. Final total cam out to $186.50 for our family of 5. Pretty decent for authentic Korean bbq dinner. Will come again as my son love it. NO GST and SVC CHARGE. Roadside parking is challenging so be patient.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108249944013054916657/reviews

Rene Ang (Rene),5,"Came here on a Sunday evening with a family of 8, and definitely highly recommend to make a booking in advance! Place was much crowded towards 7-8pm.

Food was great and we definitely had a whole selection of food. There were some things on the menu that requires pre book - such as the soy/ chicken stew. Otherwise, the other dishes were great 8.5/10 — highly recommend the ginseng chicken + japchae.

Service is great. Service staffs were attentive, despite come communication errs. Banchan + tea refillable!! Price is reasonable for what was ordered:-)
