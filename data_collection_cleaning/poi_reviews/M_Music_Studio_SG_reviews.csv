josh joshs,5,"M Music Studio Sg
I have started my instrument journey at M Music Studio Sg for almost 1 year.

Me, as a person who has no music background at all, after a few months learning, and now I'm able to play a simple song on a recital. Is it quite a surprised for me. ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

The teachers are all passionate in teaching and willing to share all the details or technique to you, just to want you to keep improving a little by little in every single class.

Of course, you might think that learning music is boring unless you really like it. But I would say, learning music could be fun and enjoyable. Because the teachers at here are all have the  experience to make it fun and use a simple way to make it easier to understand. This really help me to get understand faster and easier.

Furthermore, they are also ok a good observer and good listener to me. Example like when some of the part which is I can't do it well after few try, they will tell me why I can't do well, after that they will show me the correct way and then practice with me together step by step until you can do it correctly.

I really appreciate that's the way their teaching and passionate on me and I will keep learning just wanted to make it better and better on my music instruments.

Thank you M Music Studio SgðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116291675030267689471/reviews
