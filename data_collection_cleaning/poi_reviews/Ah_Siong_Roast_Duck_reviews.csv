Tee Yongnan,5,"This place really knows how to roast a duck‚Äîcharcoal roasted so the skin is smoky and slightly crisp, but the meat stays SUPER juicy.

The sauce is legit amazing, esp when you dip the duck in their sambal‚Äîomg chef‚Äôs kiss.

Tried the roast pork too, and it‚Äôs a great combo: crackly skin and tender meat. Only prob is it gets busy, so be ready to queue a bit, but SO worth it!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103655670304784447170/reviews

Lionel Ong,4,"Came here to try the wanton mee and and added a roast duck leg. Noodles were good!

On the sweeter side with an old school taste I remembered from the 90s. I enjoyed the noodles and charsiew. Roast duck was not bad too!

Price point is definitely good. It was still below $10. Hard to get roast duck leg without losing an arm and leg these days.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104952089142313918426/reviews

Serene Tan,5,"Tried the Char Siew Roast Pork Rice ($4) and Roasted Duck Noodles ($4). All taste nice, especially like the roast pork with it's tender fats and crispy skin.
