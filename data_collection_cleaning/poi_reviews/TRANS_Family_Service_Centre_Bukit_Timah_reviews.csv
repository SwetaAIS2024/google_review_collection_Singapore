Hyun Mm,1,"Very disappointing. They were so judgemental during my first call. I trusted them and shared all the information I would not share with anyone, all the details that causes me great deal of pain just to think about, but they focused on what I did to deserve such treatment from my family. I was so betrayed and deeply hurt, that I didn't even consider getting their counselling service.

From the reviews their counsellors sound great but I hated dealing with their social workers that I just didn't want anything to do with them. No empathy, judgemental, they need to hire better people. And to whoever spoke to me during our first call, you shouldn't be in social services. Find another job and stop hurting already vulnerable people.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116036736322441605568/reviews
vv ww,1,"Called in on 27 May 2022 to ask straightforward queries about a job. A female Chinese receptionist answered the phone. She lacks basic telephone etiquette. Talking softly, mumbling something to herself and I had to ask her to speak up little louder. I didn't know who I was talking to so kept asking for her name. It's polite to address her by name too. However, this lady was argumentative and got defensive. She didn't want to reveal her name because according to her, my queries were HQ-related. Her favourite word was 'no-no-no-no-no'.

I'm puzzled how this lady was even hired. Maybe a staff's family member or 'connections'? If she has paranoia in revealing her name, then better not work there for her mental sanity. I felt I was talking to a client. Also, how would I know that I wasn't talking to a receptionist but a mentally unwell client pretending to act as one?

She said she has no problems in giving her name but it's not important to do so and wanted me to call the HQ. I called TRANSBT and you're representing that agency. It'd be professional when you've said your name and then tell the caller that you're going to transfer him/her to HQ. Would I be right to assume that if it's HQ-related, she will not reveal her name. But she'll reveal it only if it's receptionist-related? I even shudder to think how this woman talks to clients. Anyway, whatever excuses or reasons or apologies TRANSBT wants to give, it's too late now. I believe 'first impression counts'. Unfortunately, it left a distasteful impression.

Hope you'll retrain your frontline staff or get sincere ones. No use having compassionate social workers and counsellors but your first point of contact itself is atrocious. I wasted my time talking to a 'patient'. Lousy customer service!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108820579520213625342/reviews
