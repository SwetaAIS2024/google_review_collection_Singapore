Had a plastic bag on my own and told her I didn't need more but was shown poor attitude. She was some indian cashier where I never had issue before, customer service is important please buckle up when we are spending money at your establishment.",

Highly reccomend using self-check out counter if possible. (Only accept card payments)\n\nThis giant also has the uncle jack cooked food store. Quite reasonably priced roast chicken & food products with decent taste.\n\nStaff are generally quite productive & efficient in replacing all the goods & stocks and quite friendly to all customers.",
