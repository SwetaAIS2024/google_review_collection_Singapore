      "text": "SATA Jurong Medical Center is only a 3-minute walk from Jurong East MRT. Take Exit A from the MRT station, follow the path, and cross the road. Once across, you'll spot a Cheers convenience store. Continue walking straight until you come across a self-photo booth. On your right, you‚Äôll find a lift‚Äîtake it to the 4th floor, and you'll arrive at the SATA clinic.\nThe staffs are very welcoming, polite, and attentive. Upon arriving at the SATA clinic, first proceed to the registration desk and follow the staff's guidance. After registering, you'll receive a queue number. Wait for your number to appear on the TV screen, then head to the counter displayed on the screen.\nRemember to bring your NRIC or permit card when you visit the clinic.\nAll the staffs are ready to help you.",

      "text": "Brought my dad to Sata Jurong today for chest xray. The queue at counter registration after they reopened at 1.30pm was long. Didn't realise after counter registration, we had to wait to register proper again for the different services. Fortunately, the staff at the Radiology Dept were very helpful when they realised my dad is an elderly on wheelchair. They helped to expedite his registration and the chest xray was done very soon after. A big thank you to Pauline and her male colleague for such caring attitude.",

      "text": "I wanted to share two very different experiences I had during my visits to SATA. On my recent visit (29 Apr 2025) I was really impressed with how kind and professional Nurse Nur Fadhnah was. She kindly waited 5 minutes and told me to close my eyes and relax before taking another reading since my first reading was high.  It made me feel genuinely cared for.\n\nHowever, during my first visit on 25 Feb 2025, I had a very different experience. I had a first high reading and despite telling the nurse that my arm was in pain, she proceeded to take another reading right away without waiting for 5 minutes.\nI felt really angry and told her the high reading was due to the pain when the cuff inflate. The nurse cannot be bothered. In the end I was told to buy a cuff BP Monitor to record my readings for 5 days.\nI hope all your other nurses will treat Fadhnah as their role model. Be patient and be more caring towards us. Do not work like a robot with no feelings.",
