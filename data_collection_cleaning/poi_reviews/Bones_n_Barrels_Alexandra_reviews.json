You won't regret. However the pork chop was a bit tough. The seafood marina was nice done and it was not over powered by the tomato sauce. Well you shouldn't missed out on the desserts. The staff was also very friendly and helpful.",

      "text": "Terrible experience, We came at 12.20 and ordered at 12.25, The Soup took 20 minutes to come and the drink took another 10 to come. The food (chicken) never came even after an hour and a half. We asked the waitress 3 times and the first time she did not even go to the kitchen to ask. The second time we asked she said she would go and check with the chef but instead she went to clean cutlery. Throughout the whole time, they were serving food to table which had come much later than us and had much more people than us. The 3rd time we asked she kept saying that the food would come in 2 minutes. Which it never did. When we decided to leave, the staff wasn't even apologetic but was still very smug. All in all it was a terrible experience with poor service and food that never came.",

The ambiance is perfect‚Äîcalm, relaxing, and with the option to sit indoors or enjoy the fresh air outdoors.\n\nThe food here is always top-notch, freshly prepared, and served without delay. What truly sets this place apart is the warmth and kindness of the staff. They always serve with a smile, making the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nA special shoutout to Tashi & Deepak‚Äîtwo incredibly hardworking individuals who always ensure that guests feel welcomed and well taken care of. Their personal attention, friendly service, and even occasional customization of dishes on request make all the difference.\n\nHighly recommend this spot for a great meal and a relaxing drink. Cheers to the amazing team! üçª‚ú®",
