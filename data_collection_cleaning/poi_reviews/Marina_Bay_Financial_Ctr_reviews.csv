Flo Yeow,4,"It's a slightly awkward bus stop, in the middle of everything but also feeling a little out of place against everything around it. That said, it works as a bus stop, especially if you're getting to MBS or MBFC itself. Just cross the under pass or the traffic light, and you're able to get to where you mostly need to get to. Sheltered towards MBFC and Downtown MRT station, all through Marina Bay Link Mall, towards the Raffles Place MRT side of things.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
