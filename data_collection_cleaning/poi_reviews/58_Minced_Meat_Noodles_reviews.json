Finally, for those who prefers bolder & stronger flavour [like me!], there‚Äôs a bottle of black vinegar placed at the counter so that I can add as much as I want to. üòç",

      "text": "This is the branch of the famous 58 Minced Meat Noodles which is located at the opposite Taman Jurong Market and Food Center. Don‚Äôt ask me why they opened another outlet so close by at Taman Jurong Shopping Canter‚Äôs 399 Food Court. The cook is a senior lady and the one taking orders is an elderly man.\n\nPersonally, I think this stall tastes better than the original one opposite. As usual I ordered Mee Kia Dry with chilli. $4. Portion is adequate and the noodles were cooked just nice, a bit al dente. The soup was well infused with porcine flavours from all the blanching of minced and sliced pork and liver. Give the noodles a good toss to ensure each strand is well coated with their chilli sauce and vinegar to get the perfect balance in taste. Really yummy.\n\nThe food court is rather popular but small so getting a table during meal times may be a challenge. Fortunately people here are very chill and you can easily ask to share a table with folks eating alone.\n\nCheap and good. Strongly recommended!",
