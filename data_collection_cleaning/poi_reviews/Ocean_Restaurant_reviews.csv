ZOE8DESIGN,5,"The aquarium‚Äôs marine life was presented at its finest! Coupled with great smiles and exceptional service from all staff, it made for an unforgettable experience. It would have been even better if we could mute the noise from those who couldn‚Äôt speak softly‚Äîbut of course, that‚Äôs out of anyone‚Äôs hands. Aside from that, everything else was perfect! It‚Äôs rare for me to finish every dish during fine dining, but I thoroughly enjoyed and finished everything served here. Love all fishes!

I thought the combination of chocolate lava tart and caviar would be strange, but it turned out to be a delightful surprise! Kudos to the pastry chef‚Äîit was impressive!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105673431292547849610/reviews
luckystar luckystar,5,"I had the pleasure of dining at Ocean Restaurant at Resort World Sentosa, and it was an unforgettable experience!
The ambiance is both elegant and serene, with soft lighting and tasteful decor that complements the marine theme.
The menu is a culinary journey, showcasing a blend of fresh seafood and innovative flavors. I opted for the six courses menu, which featured beautifully presented dishes. Each course was a delight, bursting with flavor and artistry. Notable highlights included the seared scallops‚Äîcooked to perfection.
The service was impeccable; the staff were knowledgeable and attentive, special recognition to Ms. WINNIE LIEW who is always ensuring that every detail of our dining experience was flawless.

Overall, Ocean Restaurant offers not just a meal, but a memorable experience that combines exquisite cuisine with breathtaking views of marine life.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107419821841101855190/reviews
Darc Kuang,4,"I rolled into Ocean Restaurant excited for an eight-course tasting and it was a real rollercoaster.

Food

The seafood all felt par-boiled rather than wok-seared, so if you‚Äôre after that big, smoky Asian punch, you might leave a little underwhelmed.

Most of the sauces were spot-on (I‚Äôm still dreaming of that miso-ginger), but the pea pur√©e? One taste and my tongue threw in the towel. üò∞

Apple crumble dessert: Cute concept, but they cranked the apple flavor so high it drowned out everything else.

Ambience

Mid-meal, it felt like an untightened tap dripped straight onto my wife‚Äôs dress‚Äîdefinitely not what you pay for in ‚Äúelegant dining.‚Äù (air con)

A squad of drain flies crashed our party, buzzing around and even landing in the bread basket. Even after they tried to shoo them off, our little guests refused to leave.

Service
Huge props to service staff May for saving the night:

Table Rescue ‚Äì Spotted the leak and moved us to drier ground.

Dish Hype ‚Äì Walked us through each course like a personal hype squad.

Photo Assist ‚Äì Snapped our shots so we didn‚Äôt end up looking like lost tourists.

Would I go back?
Maybe‚Äîbut only if service staff May is on shift, they swap out that pea pur√©e, dial down the apple in the crumble, and banish the flies.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101573096440607310906/reviews
Sky Chia,3,"Bought my wife for the anniversary lunch as she is from oversea. Reservation needs to be done at least a few months in advance as according to the serving staff there.

I did it like 3 weeks in advance due to an impromptu request from my wife to celebrate our anniversary. In additional we had also requested for any seat next to the fishes.

The location is a bit hard to find from the carpark to another carpark. And finally found the place.

We were set to a location where there was a super big pillar and yet paying the same pricing as the restaurant customers. The experience wasn't that great despite our advanced information being given to the restaurant. If only this carefully address to.

I think if the restaurant can pay ABIT attention and if the view wasn't available can keep us in the loop as leaving is an options to other restaurants and not with regrets.

Lastly we had to wait till 1 of the family tables had finished their meal then we requested to have our seats changed before the serving of the deserts.

Sincerely hope the restaurant can be upfront to any patron that visiting base on their request availability instead of only on sales on patrons which this is also too important to the revenue of the restaurant.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118252133846776299305/reviews
Chris Southgate,5,"I wish I could give 6 stars for Atmosphere! Every time we dine at the Ocean Restaurant I'm amazed at how magical it is. Nothing compares in the land of skybars. New menu was great too... well it's  been awhile since we visited, so new to us. The staff were friendly and attentive too. Thank you.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108760301217966920397/reviews
