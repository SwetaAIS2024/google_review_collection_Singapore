Petals Ray,5,"This dessert place never fails to surprise me with something new every now & then. 1st fell in love with their chendol soft serve with their secret receipe of adding simple lemon & other interesting stuffs into their chendol to make it really special.  Today they surprised me & mummy with a very delicious or-ni ice-cream soft served, mixed with black glutinuous rice, sweet, salty & fragrant!!!  Its dark chocolate ice-cream isn't too sweet for my mum's diet as well!!  To top everything up, they also had very beautiful service from hosts with sweet paranakan roots.  Simply love this homely place. No regrets bringing my mummy along ❤️💞5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107069958276024898779/reviews
Brindha Vijay,5,"The ice cream is tasty and offered at an affordable price. The staff are very friendly, especially the Aunty and Uncle who are so lovely. They love kids and often give complimentary ice cream while customers are deciding on their order. The atmosphere is very nice!

Derek Chua,2,"Overall: 4/10

Nice cafe, with cold air-conditioning and nice decor. Service was good and prompt as well, so that’s great.
However, the Iced Matcha Latte I ordered was horrible. It was basically Iced Milk with a sprinkle of Matcha powder - it tasted nearly nothing like Matcha.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112116594092366723505/reviews
Joe C.H. Ng,5,"Came here for dessert after dinner on a Saturday night. Cafe was busy but we managed to get a table. Ordered the egglet waffle with blue vanilla and early grey ice cream, cup of chocolate ice cream and their weekly special. All of them were great, especially their “orh nee” ice cream with a topping of pulut hitam that paired well with the taro and ice cream. Eventually we also ordered a few pints of their ice cream for home consumption.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101412856189523387954/reviews
