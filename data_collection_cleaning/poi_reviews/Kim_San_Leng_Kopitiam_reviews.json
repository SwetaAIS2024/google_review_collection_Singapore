      "text": "Don‚Äôt let the run-down coffeeshop fool you üòâ, this humble spot is home to one of the best Mee Hoon Kueh I‚Äôve had in a long time. Despite the limited number of stalls, this particular vendor truly stands out with his authentic, handmade kueh that‚Äôs cooked to perfection.\n\nThe broth itself is a throwback to old-school flavors‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs comforting, rich, and full of that nostalgic, homely taste you just don‚Äôt come by easily anymore. You can tell a lot of heart and effort goes into every bowl.\n\nIt‚Äôs rare to find Mee Hoon Kueh that reminds you of the ones our elders used to make, and this stall really nails it. A true hidden gem that‚Äôs worth the visit if you‚Äôre craving something honest, simple, and absolutely delicious.\n\nHighly recommend supporting this hardworking vendor!",
