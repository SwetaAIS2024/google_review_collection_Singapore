AC Chan,5,"This plate has the right balance of eggy omelette, crispy bits and soft, gooey starch with smaller briny oysters 🦪.
And dare I say it’s probably the best version I can find in the western part of SG 🇸🇬?
But I guess one thing I know for sure — I’m officially a fan. 🙂‍↔️",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Wei,2,"The visit started well with fried oysters priced reasonably at $3-$5 and served in generous portions. Unfortunately, the quality didn't match the value. The ingredients felt stale, and the flour had an unpleasant sour taste. Additionally, a significant part of the dish was overly charred (烧焦不是锅气／wok-hei), which made it inedible (see photo). Service was also below expectations. Despite standing at the stall and calling out twice, I was blatantly ignored for over five minutes until the vendor responded dismissively. This experience was notably poor, even for casual hawker standards.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106857427212997686613/reviews
Alvin Mah,4,"A decent plate of fried oysters from a stall that specialises in this dish. The eggs part of the dish is fried precisely to a crispy texture. Even for the smallest $3 plate, you get at least 3 juicy oysters. Overall, if I am craving for fried oysters, this would be my first choice around this area. For those budget conscious, I believe we cannot find fried oysters at this price anymore. The famous Newton stall starts at $8. Taste it before the price increases.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101731562623200370370/reviews

Finally we are here for the cheapest orh luak in town!! Uncle still sells it at very afforable prices starting at $3. We had a plate of $4 to share. Might look decent to others but to us we feel it's very in depth kind of orh luak. Uncle 功力深厚啊.

No doubt, uncle got great skill of frying, when he served us we could smell the fragrance, what WE call ‘the wok hei of fried oyster'. The starch he use and the fried egg surrounding it, is just so well balanced.

His starch is good, fried well, not too much, not too little, has a light crisp and he make sure starch doesn't steal the limelight away from his crispy fried egg. Topped with a generous mix of small and medium sized oysters.  Uncle fries a short while so the oysters retain the smoothness and creamy taste. Taste very good and fresh. The best thing is uncle’s fried oyster is not oily!

Wonderful orh luak!!

lontongstroong,5,"Great value for money. Not many places where you can get cheap but great oyster these days. The shop only sells two menus - fried oyster and oyster omelette, priced based on the portion size ($3-5).

The oyster omelette is good and substantial enough as a standalone meal or a part of a meal. The egg and starch were fried to perfection - crispy at the edges but softer at the center. The oysters, came in small and medium-sized ones, were still reasonably fresh and creamy. Being not too greasy is also a great plus!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
