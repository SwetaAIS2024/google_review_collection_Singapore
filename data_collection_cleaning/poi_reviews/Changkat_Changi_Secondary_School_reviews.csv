Drag_ n,1,"I'm not a student from CCSS but I want to share something. My school came to CCSS for some cca sports battle thing and like the amount of respect we got was just horrible. I'm sorry to those students or residents reading this comment but the students there are really rude and just downright unfair. The referees, which were students from that school, took advantage and kept calling my school out for not following the rules. I want to admit that yes we might have done it a few times but it is not that much. My school was close to winning but they immediately stopped the game and said that it's break time, none of this is a lie. Everything I shared is base on true events which I think should be heard by others. I don't mean to humiliate or start anything but I just don't want anyone to be deceived or go through such things. I still encourage attending but just keep in mind of all the possibilities and how it may influence bad habits.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115288447975739477595/reviews
hailey ang,1,1 star for existing. this sch is ugly inside out and im pretty sure most of the teachers and principal only treat students who have gd grades well. theres also too many “motivational talks” which isnt even motivational cuz of how often we get those talks. the environment in the sch is also not very nice as well. i nvr understood the rule abt not being allowed to wear pe uniform only the formal uniform like whats the diff?? we arent allowed to wear pe because we “abuse this privilege” like wearing the pe uniform isnt even a privilege its just a little more comfortable to move arnd with. both uniforms represent the sch whats the problem. and having to disallow wearing of pe and only allowed to bring to sch to change if we have pe classes as a punishment is so low. honestly felt suffocated being in this place and was so glad when i finally graduated.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107358446156602306743/reviews
