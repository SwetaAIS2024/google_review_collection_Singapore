Bi Jun,5,"Amazing fine dining experience! Food prepared by the chefs was superb, and love the open-concept yet cozy dining area. There were also small interesting stories behind the dishes, shared by the lovely female staff. They were very sweet to prepare a surprise birthday tart. We really enjoyed ourselves and definitely value for money!!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114681566228251893650/reviews
Justin Yak,4,Nice dining experience over here. We have went there to celebrate for our 13th anniversary together with our kid. Food is decent and is as good as some of the Michelin starred restaurants that we have been to around the world.

Kkenn Kkenn,5,"A unique experience! Celebrating my brother's birthday at Kioku was the best decision. My typically conservative Teochew brother loved the 2.5-hour dining experience. The fusion of modern French and Italian cuisines, with Hungarian-sourced foie gras, was extraordinary. Every dish was a delightful surprise in presentation and flavor. The white and red wine pairings complemented the dishes perfectly. The ambiance was elegant yet cozy, and the staff were exceptionally attentive and friendly. Thank you, Kioku, for a memorable evening. We will definitely be back!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115727377058243312210/reviews

yozuki amamiya,4,"The food is very evocative and they take great care in the ingredients they use, and you can appreciate the craftsmanship in the beautifully presented food! I didn't give it a 5 because the use of ingredients could have done with more surprises. Suggest going with your family and friends to experience the out-of JB deliciousness!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106797871689160892733/reviews
