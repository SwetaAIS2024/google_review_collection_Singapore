Vera,5,"I am incredibly grateful for the guidance and support I've received from my piano teacher, Wendy. Thanks to her expertise, patience, and encouragement, I was able to smoothly reach Grade 8 in piano. Her teaching style is methodical and structured, ensuring that I mastered the technical aspects of each piano piece. Aside from learning pieces from the piano syllabus/exam, I was also able to explore more new age/pop music scores, which allowed me to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for music. Wendy also provided clear and constructive feedback, which helped me grow in my piano journey and personal life. I highly recommend her to anyone looking to advance their piano skills.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108247941555904209730/reviews
Cindy Ng,5,"My daughter was taught by Wendy and she successfully passed Grade 8. Wendy was incredibly patient and encouraging, using various methods to spark my daughterâ€™s interest in the piano. She even bought books and invited us to attend piano concerts.

D H,5,"Ms Chan was my piano teacher for six years, who brought me from grade 3 to grade 8. Six years is a longtime, and throughout my adolescence, Iâ€™ve benefited from Ms Chanâ€™s patience, kindness and deep passion for piano music. To this day, I still remember her patiently teaching me scales, theory, and exam songs. Even on weeks when I donâ€™t have time to practice or follow instructions, Ms Chan was always gentle yet firm with her instructions.

Iâ€™m also deeply grateful for Ms Chanâ€™s sharing of her passion for music. Aside from just teaching, Ms Chan will organise a gathering for all her students at her place, where we each play a song and network over food. In addition, she also share news of piano concerts when famous pianists visits Singapore and recommends us to go for them for an all-rounded experience learning and listening.

If not for Ma Chan, I might not have passed grade 8, and piano wouldnâ€™t have left such an indelible impression in my teen years.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100087954613532876180/reviews
April San,5,"It was back in 2013 when Ms Chan was my piano teacher. I have changed many teachers before her and I have not found one like her since. Unlike most, I had to undergo re-learning as I did not start music properly, until I was in my teens - and Ms Chan had shown incredible skills, passion, patience and kindness towards me. [i.e. she had to tolerate through episodes of my laziness and lack of practice of scales, ahaha] ðŸ˜‚

She is nurturing and genuine with everyone. I remembered my first experience attending a concerto at esplanade with Ms Chan - it sparked an interest and till this day, I remained appreciative of classical music in various forms.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118263215324467013157/reviews
