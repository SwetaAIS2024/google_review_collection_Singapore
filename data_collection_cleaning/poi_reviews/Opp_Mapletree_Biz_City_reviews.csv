Flo Yeow,4,"I used to alight at the bus stop before this, in getting towards MBC. But this bus stop makes much more sense, especially if you're heading towards Block 10/20, or the stack behind (blocks 50-80). Just cross the traffic lights and voila. Unfortunately though, it's not sheltered, so if you're caught in the rain, you may want to head towards the ARC bus stop instead.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Suvendu Mohanty,5,It’s opposite to Mapletree Business City. If you wish to travel towards NUS then board bus from here. Also people use this bus stop to go Pasir Panjang MRT from here.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109830336848008938791/reviews
