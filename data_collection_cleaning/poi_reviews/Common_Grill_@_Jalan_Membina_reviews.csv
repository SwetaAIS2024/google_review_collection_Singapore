Dan Ng,4,"Was there ard 1030pm, coffeeshop is about to close, common grills is the only stall left open. The service is acceptable. The food looks good, tastes good. Was satisfied that I only need to spend $30 to enjoy a good meal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102949907020282965906/reviews
Joanne Tan,1,"I have order set pork and chicken chop comes with mushroom soup, as I receive my order 1st thing I took the soup and drink the 1st spoon I had a souries taste and I though I might be wrong so I tasted again and it’s still the same I smell and it’s smell very bad! Pls use ur common sense la which it’s a soup la where can reheat the whole damn day and use back or if can also try it out 1st urself b4 selling and becoz of this I rather just throw all away even though it’s a waste! 19/11/2024 is my date of order and this is my last I just hope I’m not gonna get any stomach pain after this！",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118357010501925863584/reviews
Yin L,1,Don’t order the grilled salmon. It was terribly over cooked and the sides of the fish were hard. Had to dig into the middle of the piece to find acceptable texture.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108226586062214326779/reviews
Birdie Sk,2,"i had ordered their fish n chips and chicken chop from here before. their chicken chop is absolutely worth and delicious (their gravy is NOT), comes with spaghetti and corn. and their fish n chips were DELICIOUS, or at a year ago. i just ordered, and watched them make it. they fried my already fried fish (so… refry??), then cut it in half and microwaved it. and i wonder why my fish is so dry and hard!! this is legit the worst fish and chips ever and mind u it’s not considered cheap for this type of food. it’s so dry the fish is flaking, and so hard that it can’t even be cut without struggle. how bout, instead of giving us cutlery that is essentially only good enough to eat a sandwich with, give us cutlery strong enough to cut ts. idk! maybe, just an idea!! especially when u wanna serve hard and dry food. MIND U, i just ordered it and taobao, and ate it soon after, not ONE HOUR or a million years later, and it felt like i was eating last weeks leftovers as a brokie (except this was not a brokie priced meal). thanks for coming to my ted talk, in summary, it no longer is good and it sucks. even their service. k thanks bye.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113217431225885103887/reviews
