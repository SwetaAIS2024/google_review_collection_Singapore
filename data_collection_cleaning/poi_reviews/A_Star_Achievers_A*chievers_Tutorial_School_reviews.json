      "text": "The tutors are not only knowledgeable but also approachable, often taking the time to greet students individually and create a relaxed learning environment. For instance, I struggled alot in secondary school with science and english. One of my tutors, Mr Tan, patiently explained it multiple times until I understood it. He also made himself available outside of class hours for additional guidance, which greatly improved my grasp of the subjects and gave me the confidence to do well in my O levels. His support has significantly enhanced my learning experience, making me feel valued and encouraged as a student.",
