      "text": "We had a table of four from our side. Iâ€™d like to share a few comments. Firstly, the restaurant seemed understaffed, as the service was noticeably slow and inefficient. Secondly, one of us ordered the salmon spaghetti, which turned out to be extremely disappointing â€” easily one of the worst salmon dishes weâ€™ve ever had, which is surprising given itâ€™s usually a safe option.\n\nThe handling of the situation was also poor. The manager simply replaced the dish without offering any apology, and unfortunately, the second serving was just as bad. The rest of the meals â€” mainly grilled chicken sets â€” were acceptable.\n\nAs we were leaving, I raised the concern with an elderly staff member about the food quality, but her response lacked any sense of apology or acknowledgment. The manager remained silent throughout. The salmon tasted and smelled unpleasant â€” almost like it had been washed in dirty water, with a sewer-like odor.\n\nPlease take this as constructive feedback: avoid serving salmon dishes in their current state, and improve service standards â€” especially since youâ€™re located in Changi, a place that should reflect the high standards of Singapore.",

Staff was friendly and helpful.\n\nPls order the wagyu steak if you come here. Love it! Ice lemon tea is just nice, not too sweet and does not taste artificial.",
