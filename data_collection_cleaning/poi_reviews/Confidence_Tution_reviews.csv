Crisist,5,"The teacher is extremely passionate about her students and is very flexible with timing. She makes sure all the students get the best of the lesson and make sure the practice at home. She also provides essential revision material and recommends the best books to buy😇. For a month, you can come as many times as you’d like and still pay the same monthly fee. This teacher really wants to see her students improve 🫶 if you are struggling with Chinese come here❤️❤️❤️",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107659519854528552822/reviews
