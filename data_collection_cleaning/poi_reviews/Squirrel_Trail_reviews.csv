Forest BK,5,"🐿️Squirrel Trail is a short trail consisting of boardwalk and cobblestone pathways.
🦨The Trail run parallel to Venus Link, and along freshwater stream and pond surrounding so it can get a little tricky during wet days.
🐿️Vistors are likely to meet squirrels along the trail.
🦨Hike along the Squirrel Trail and immerse its rich flora diversity.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
German Kolesnikov,5,"Great side trail that goes parallel to the Venus walk, partially a boardwalk, partially ground-level, with large stones going amidst the swamp/wetland area. Can be inaccessible after rain due to flooding.
There are plenty of butterflies, dragonflies, small fish, and squirrels present (sometimes be wary that they are eating something in the trees above you!)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114747592889293933023/reviews

xiong jing,5,"This is a vast garden. There is many flowers and towering trees offering flora and fauna. The ground is well paved and clean. As its name suggests, it has many squirrels. Admire the cute squirrels nibbling on walnuts and see them jumping from one tree trunk to another. There is also a small serene stream and its water is cold. A scenic and picturesque place perfect to cycle, jog or to breathe in the fresh air.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117049585208534108812/reviews
