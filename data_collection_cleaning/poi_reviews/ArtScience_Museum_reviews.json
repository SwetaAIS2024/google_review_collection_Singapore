You might need to buy tickets for exhibitions upon arrival.\n\nThe outside has a shallow pond with lilly. Its beautiful and calm. I would recommend seating on the pond side and admire the Lilly and the tiny little fish.\nThe exhibitions were detailed and worth the price, i liked the one with lights.\nThey have a cafeteria and toilets.",

Each area is different and offers a different feel. The kids enjoyed it, especially the interactive aspect. However, you need to watch your kids as they can easily get lost in the crowd",

Unlike a traditional museum, this place is filled with technology. There a plenty of activities for kids to enjoy. You can paint your sketch and get into these mixed reality screens. Itâ€™s so cool.",
