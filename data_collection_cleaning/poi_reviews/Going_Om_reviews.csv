Sally Chung,4,"I visited this alley on a Friday night and found it to be less crowded than Haji Lane, which was a pleasant surprise. While the drink selection is somewhat limited, particularly the beer options, the snacks exceeded my expectations. The pani puri and the platter we ordered were both delightful. I would definitely return for another quick drink and bite.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115078901798104415287/reviews

Maryam Hazly,5,"Heard great reviews by a friend that it was a nice cosy cafe with nice food and friendly staff. I went for dinner with friends and her young daughter. Pani puri and fried mushrooms are a must try. The rest of the foods great too. The manager surprised us with a slice of cake and candle to wish happy birthday to my friends daughter. He had overheard us talking about her birthday.
The cake is delicious. Vegan red velvet cake with beetroot. Moist soft and not too sweet. Tasted better than normal red velvet cake! Thank you for making it memorable night. :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118032997297667379246/reviews
Suyin Supramaniam,5,My Viet drip coffee that‚Äôs true to the haji lane days. I find myself drawn to Going Om because of the staff like Uven as well. Missing those days that we used to dance in the street until dawn. I wax nostalgic.
