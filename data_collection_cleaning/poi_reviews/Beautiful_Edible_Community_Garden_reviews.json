In weekends you can see them gather in the resting area of the garden and you can get to know them better and ask for permission to enter and take a tour around. As a budding gardener, this garden is very inspiring! They have previously grown large pumpkins suspended vertically too! Thereâ€™s also hydroponically grown vegetables inside! Beautiful and memorable garden!",
