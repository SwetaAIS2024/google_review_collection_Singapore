We got here early to explore the mall before watching Spectra at 8pm. L3 is the food court. That in itself is an activity you need to make sure to have plenty of time to enjoy many varieties of different ethnic food. Also donâ€™t forget to enjoy the gondola with your loved ones at the bottom floor, think itâ€™s B2. Check the signs.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110252304392731387034/reviews
