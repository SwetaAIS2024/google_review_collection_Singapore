      "text": "Recently got to know that the stall was taken over by a young couple. Tried their signature chicken chop + an add on wing and it is awesome and taste exactly the same as the previous owner, seems like they have taken over the recipe. Unlike many other western food stall, their signature chicken chop taste tender and juicy. Well marinated and cooked!\n\nAside from the main dish, the coleslaw and fried bun side dish taste extremely good as well.\n\nPrice: Acceptable\nWaiting Time: Acceptable\nService: Very friendly\n\nI highly recommend this stall. Definitely one of my top choice for western food.",

Somehow the chilli is nostalgically and magically good for me..\nIts the type of comfort food ðŸ˜‹",
