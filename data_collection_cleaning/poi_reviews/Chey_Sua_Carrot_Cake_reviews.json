And towards the end, you might find it a bit greasy.\n\nThe pricing is very low, and I think they could increase the price to manage the queue and for their own wellbeing too. They should take things easy at this age.",

No!!! ðŸ˜¡\n\nComplete no for me because of the owner's impoliteness.\n\nI understand that the job can be stressful and thankless...\n\n... but mumbling something, rolling eyes and scratching my order off the pad like the paper was at fault is an absolute fail...all i said was that I'll have to come back another time to try because I didn't have the 45 mins to wait.\n\nAlas, there will be no other time for me at this stall, and will spend my money elsewhere where the food might not be that good but the interaction will at least be palatable.",

Not warm  Not friendly, Not helpful!\n\nPortion isn't big and carrort cake is so flat. Like pancakes.\n\nStall does open before 7am.\nWashroom is available on site.\n\nWld i try again - No.\nWorth the 30mins wait - No.\n\nGive this stall a miss (for the lousy service).",

At an affordable price of $3, this traditional carrot cake is definitely one of the more interesting ones I have eaten. While undeniably delicious, it can be a tad oily for some tastes. Long queues, often 45 to 60 minutes, are common, and the stall can sell out early, but the crowd proves itâ€™s a must-try at least once for any Singaporean food lover.",
