Their sampling policy limits each customer to two tries each but the sample pours are very generous.\n\nPlace seems a little understaffed, though - when it was time to pay the bartender was nowhere in sight and it turned out he'd gone out for a long smoke.",

Croatia, Georgia, Estonia and even some smoothie beers (sweet beers that have texture of a smoothie but are alcoholic). The place is small and only a few seats but the owners are nice and helpful and it feels like a little hidden community. If you are in the area it‚Äôs a nice place to stop in for a beer. I think they also have some simple food if you want but we just had drinks. The beers are a little expensive but I like that they are on tap. There are also some bottle beers but we prefer the drafts. Nice place.",
