The supportive administration made our sudden departure from the country much easier to handle. The amazing package they offer stands out, especially in the overpriced market of Singapore. Highly recommended!",

Attention to the kids, kind and supportive attitude and wide variety of daily activities along with bilingual approach made this preschool the best option for us. Beyond grateful to all the teachers for making this place so warm and where everyone feels welcomed!",

      "text": "The main reason we have chosen this school for our son 1.5 years ago is the trilingual approach, which is unique in Singapore so far if I'm not mistaken. The combination of Russian, English and Chinese languages is quite rare and we are so happy we managed to find it! Our son now is 5.5 years old and he has graduated from Alpha Green recently. We are sad that we have to find another solution to keep all three languages flowing as the school has done it perfectly!\nThe good care for children coupled with creative and holistic approach to education makes the school standing out. Huge thank you to all staff for support and care, initiatives and information  during our son's stay there. We really appreciate the knowledge and fun he experienced there!",
