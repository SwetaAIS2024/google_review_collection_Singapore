Cornelius Kuah,5,"Had my first one-on-one golf session with coach Syafiq, and it was an eye-opening experience!

He made the basics easy to understand and focused on improving my swing with clear, practical guidance.

The session was engaging, and I could see progress within just an hour. His patience and ability to break things down make learning enjoyable, whether you’re a beginner or looking to refine your skills.

Highly recommend if you’re looking for a great golf coach!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103886442372224930756/reviews

Ryan Chung,5,"Highly recommend Syafiq! Gave me a few free online analysis prior to our first trial, and patiently helped me with my own swing issues! Also appreciate the technology he used for coaching in analysing my swing, which made the experience way better in understanding how to improve. Thanks Syafiq!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101255221153090516829/reviews
Ernest Lee,5,"Coach Syafiq, was very helpful, patient and quick to identify what training aids that helped correct my swing. I had a persistent hooking issue for my long irons and woods for quite some time. But after my first trial lesson, (signed up after) I had manage to resolve my hooking issue with Coach Syafiq. He also focused on my ball striking ability to get the compression upon impact. Very happy with the outcome of the trial lesson!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114773784062541562869/reviews
