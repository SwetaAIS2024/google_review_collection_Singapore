TTT,4,"A hidden gem managed by a dedicated elderly lady who runs the store entirely on her own. The noodles were cooked to perfection, with a springy and satisfying texture. The char siew was unique, coated in a deliciously sweet sauce that set it apart. The wantons were generously stuffed, and the chili added a kick that elevated the entire dish to perfection.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117174446031825028588/reviews
oXRYSTALo Ong,3,"Alright, folks, listen up! Donkey and I decided to grab a quick breakfast since my bike is at Lew Scooter waiting to change the Bb. I was in the mood for wanton mee, while Donkey opted for the laksa next door.

The Good:

• The Wonton Mee: Although, there’s no wow factor but wanton mee tasted fine. The char siew was also nice, although the wanton was a little salty. The noodles were cooked perfectly. I felt that the price was very reasonable for this coffee shop set up.

• The Service: The lady owner was incredibly friendly and went above and beyond to make sure I had a great experience.

The Quirks:

• The Wantan: The wanton was a bit salty.

Donkey’s Note: It will be great if the wanton is not so salty.

My Note: The wanton noodle tasted ok

Rating:

• Food: 3/5 (Noodle is well cooked)

• Service: 5/5 (Excellent and friendly)

• Atmosphere: 3/5 (Typical coffee shop)

Overall: 3/5

Overall: If you're in the area and craving wanton mee, it's really worth a try.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews
Doraemon,4,"Kitty and I came here for breakfast while we left our bikes at Lew Scooter for a replacement. Kitty decided to try the wanton mee stall, while I tried the laksa next door. The lady owner was very friendly and extended her utmost service to Kitty.  The wanton mee cost $4.

Kitty found the wanton mee to be a pleasant surprise.  She thought the char siew was also nice, although the wantan was a little salty. The noodles were cooked perfectly. She felt that the price was very reasonable for this coffee shop set up.

However, the service was excellent, and the ambience was okay. If you're in the area and craving wantan mee, it's really worth a try.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112665277904119154671/reviews
Ed T,5,"Awesome old school Wanton Noodles.

Run by a sole senior lady, this is as authentic as it gets.

Forget all those big popular chains.

This is what you want if you really want legit good tasting wanton noodles.

Definitely coming back again and again amd again…",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118071263998897226945/reviews
desasolo,5,"Tried today after reading so many positive reviews. Indeed, the wanton mee is our local style which is light coloured(not the black sauce type). The meepok is nicely done, the charsiew portion extremely generous and wanton though medium size have full fillings.
Seller is also rather polite and shows her sincerity by thanking her customer. A very positive impression.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112347831816262347052/reviews
