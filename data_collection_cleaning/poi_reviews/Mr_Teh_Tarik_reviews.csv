ERIC CHAN,4,This stall has been around for decades. Food is still great. Was here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon at 12pm. Not too busy. Still managed to find seats. The mee soto and Mee Rebus was good. The rempah is flavorful. Longtong was good too and the chili packed quite a punch.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113614902035973411013/reviews
Adam Gazari,4,"Bought a bowl of mee soto for breakfast from the nasi padang stall. No comment about the server. Sheâ€™s ok. Maybe not a morning person. The broth was good. I like it. But the shredded chicken was tough. The yellow noodle was a bit hard, need another 2 more minutes of boiling.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100331608463018382443/reviews
Seri Md Salleh,4,"Early dinner..paid $31.90
Generally taste wise okay but the onions on fish was burnt . And Hong Kong Steam fish was not the usual that I tasted before.  Wait was slightly longer than expected.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111204393317671761104/reviews
lathiff abdul,1,"I think the biz here too good already.
I wanted to order roti john and asked for cucumbers and sauce.

Seller says don have. When i tell him sure hv cucumbers in his shop rite, he wanted to charge me for it!

Worse part is, when i decided not to buy, he could not care less.
That's why i say biz too good. Arrogant attitude.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104916375249057169780/reviews
