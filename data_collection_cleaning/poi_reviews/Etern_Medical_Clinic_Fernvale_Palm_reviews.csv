Nur Syazana,5,Receptionist Zuhara is very nice lady and knowledgeable. It's amazing how I can seek her advice before visiting the clinic - superb! Not recommend to go if it's a Locum doctor - it's not that bad but not something I favourite about it as i prefer the clinic doctor itself.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100080089728817550055/reviews
G C,1,"GP commented that I am too young to do a colonscopy, despite blood in my stools. Had I taken his advice I would have died. Turned out to be a stage 3 colon cancer. Don't just quote the general health advice of 50 years old! Greenhorn. 2 Nurses at reception said they will help to organise my referral to a colonscopy. They offered but didn't do it. Don't offer to do it, if you aren't do it. I was delayed by 2 weeks because of you receptionists! And i found out I had cancer. This is serious people!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102097348045226949266/reviews
