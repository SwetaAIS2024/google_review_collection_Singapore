      "text": "Bidadari Park transcends the typical urban green space, offering a refined escape for those seeking tranquility amidst Singapore's vibrant pulse. It is a place where history whispers through the rustling leaves of mature trees, and the serene expanse of Alkaff Lake reflects a sky painted with subtle hues. Here, one finds a delicate balance between curated nature and a profound sense of place and peace.\n\nThe park's design thoughtfully integrates its past, transforming a former cemetery into a haven of contemplation. The restored lake, now a shimmering centerpiece, invites leisurely strolls and moments of quiet reflection.\n\nIt is where one can rediscover the simple pleasures of nature, appreciate the subtle artistry of landscape design, and find a moment of respite from the demands of modern life.",

The two key features of the park are the pond with five fountains right at the front and the Rolling Hills at the eastern side of the park. The park is popular for walks and strolling with pets. There is also a playground with fascinating multi-tier slides for children",

      "text": "On a hot Friday afternoon, across from The Woodleigh Mall, sits a beautiful garden that encapsulates Winnie the Pooh's forest. It has an interesting feature, which is Alkaff Lake, both a recreational lake and a stormwater reservoir that retains water runoff during a heavy downpour. There are water level \"red\" indicators along the perimeter of Alkaff Lake to allow distribution or discharge of excess rainfall through specific outlets or channels, or drains. Alkaff Lake is designed to control floods occurring in the area\n\nAnother destination is the Raptor's Nest Lookout, which takes the form of a Bird's nest perched at the top of a tall pole to give visitors a glimpse of Woodliegh's beautiful natural scenery and HDB BTO of Bidadari.",
