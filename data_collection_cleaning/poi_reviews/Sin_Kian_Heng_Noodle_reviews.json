Overall still value for money taste in .However the guy behind me ordered the Â∞èÁ¢óÈù¢ and the pig trotters . Looks very good . Next time would try with friends . As I think for 1 the portion is a bit too much with noodles and the pig trotters .",

      "text": "Very polite owners. You can see from the bowl how much of sauces are used to ensure that the noodles get all the flavour from soaking into these sauces. The mushroom is chewy n tender. Pork cooked just right. Not too hard (overcooked). Noodles are not overcooked as well. With the right texture and chewiness. Highly recommended 2 try. Be prepared to Queue and wait during peak hours for sure.\n\nCoffeeshop setting. Very near Sin Ming Autocity. If you service your car. Make sure to drop by and try.",

      "text": "Apologies for the bad photo, to be honest , didn‚Äôt had much expectations cause I had ordered the mini pot noodle before looking at the reviews and true enough, only after ordering and realising it was a slightly long wait as per other reviews, was kinda turn off. So I just randomly took a photo.\n\nBUT.. I have to say this is one of the better mini pot I had fr. Ingredients was generous , noodles blends in well overall. Price wise was great , $6 for this is considered good as compared with other places.\n\nMy wait was about 20mins+ , which is slightly long in my opinion. But I would still visit again just for its taste. Good to have a go, just don‚Äôt have much expectations on the wait and the food will be worth it. üëçüèª",
