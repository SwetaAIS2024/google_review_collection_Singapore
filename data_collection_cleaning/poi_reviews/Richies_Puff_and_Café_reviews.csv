K Lee,4,"Was there for supper on 1 Feb 2024 around 1am. The nasi lemak came with hot rice, fish cake and chicken were also heated before serving. However, the chicken wing was a bit too oily. Pricing at $5.90 for this late night supper.

Opens until 4am, according to the sign.

No other customers at that time. The staff was polite and friendly. Maybe things have changed for the better at this stall. Cheers!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108917027057615761095/reviews
Feliz,2,"Not that fantastic curry puff to be excited about. Their standard really has drop alot. If you can see my photos below , you can see such a small little pathetic amount of chicken meat. I have lost my words to talk about this curry puff, used to be my favourite place to buy curry puff.

Well you can try to eat there, maybe when bring back it taste so so. Anyway they do sell Nasi Lemak which is so so also nothing special .

Go ahead and try if you guys happened to pass by that area but no need to purposely go there lah, not really worth the trip.

I m sure there is other great Curry puff and Nasi lemak to try in Singapore.

All the best if you decided to try, Don't say I never warn you.

Dee,1,"Nope, never buying it again. Actually just got 3 curry puffs (2 curry chicken and 1 chicken cheese). This place according to the staff is not 24 hours but closes at 3am.

Havent had richie's for awhile now but i must say standards have dropped tremendously, though I appreciate the staff making it fresh for me the curry puff had oil sipped through the big hole in my puff and it was practically doused in oil especially the filling. I too couldn't agree more with the other reviews that said fillings tasted rancid, it was true.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113080530908100388490/reviews
Dino Bear,1,"""I recently visited Richie’s and had an extremely disappointing experience. The kitchen was poorly lit, which immediately raised concerns about cleanliness and food safety. The staff member who served me was rude and dismissive, only to become overly nice and insincere right after cashing me out. This sudden shift in behavior left me with a gut feeling that she may have even spat in my food. I was so uncomfortable that I ended up not eating it. This experience seriously made me question the standards at this establishment, and I won’t be returning. I recommend others think twice before eating here.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116362632124128418275/reviews
