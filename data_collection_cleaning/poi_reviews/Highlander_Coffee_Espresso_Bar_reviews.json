Staffs are heart warming and the lady was worried if I might not be able to finish my food, upon serving my sandwich she offered me a box for takeout. ü•∞ Thanks for the good hospitality! Definitely will visit again!",

The moment I stepped in with my wife, we knew this place would offer something good.\n\nOrdered a Peppery Passion Tuna Sandwich and Gouda BBQ chicken sensation man that names are funky. Love it. The shop atmosphere is great cozy, and the people are nice. Small table, but it serves its purpose very well with a small, nice plant to display and on sales too. The chef originated from the Philippines.\n\nThe food came, and I must say it's the texture in the bread crust that mixes well with the ingredients.  Pity that the amount is a bit small for a pricey meal\n\nCan't fill my belly up, but I am happy. The coffee ‚òïÔ∏èÔ∏è is ok but pricey.",
