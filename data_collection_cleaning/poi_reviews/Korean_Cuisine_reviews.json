Normal Price was $7.50 & $6.30 respectively. The portion of meat could have been given more. Soup and Kimchi were good üëç Long queues, service slightly slow. Waiting Time 10mins.",

      "text": "Great food and also quite consistent with quality. Tried the BBQ beef with rice, saba fish with rice, BBQ beef + spicy chicken with rice, and spicy sotong with rice. All are well done, and you can ask for the sotong to be less spicy. Stall is very generous with saba fish and meat portions. Chilli is unique and adds a new flavour to the fish.",
