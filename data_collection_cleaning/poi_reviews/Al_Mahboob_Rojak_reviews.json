So I‚Äôm happy I got to try it there. Price is more expensive than your usual coffee shop rojak. Even for drinks like teh or Milo.",

Especially the crispy fritters (top left corner). Super crispy and the texture soaks up the gravy for an eruption of flavors in the mouth.\n\nThe mee goreng wasn‚Äôt shabby either but serving portion little disappointing.",

Especially they are now upgrade to more franchise looks with clean and standardized modern meal experience.\n\nLocated at commercial building with air-conditioned, this pretty new Indian Mamak eatery provide wide variety of food selections and seats. Pick your favorite Rojak items, send it to counter and make all other food orders and collect calling device and pay upon food collection. But beverage counter at the right side you have to order, pay and collect on the spot.\n\nAs for the foods, I do like my Maggi Mee Goreng, an fried instant noodle with mutton. Yes. Very well stir-fry, not oily, got good wok-hey. Flavourful and not over seasoning. Simple balance and fragrance. Loved it.\n\nFor their popular Indian Rojak, I don't taste fantastic but just good. Lots of Rojak selections, it was clean and well fried. Not all are good, I am only like some of it, especially fried onions dough, it was delicious!\n\nAs for rest of the Rojak items, pretty common, can tell not specially fresh made, or maybe leave it for hours. Their chilli gravy was just okay, not outstanding. If you really like Indian Rojak, I must say, the best Indian Rojak in Singapore, still the two at West Coast Drive, they tucked at Ayer Rajah Food Centre. Try it if you have chance. But I can't deny that this AI Mahboob Rojak is much cleaner and more hygienic.\n\nAs last, their beverage, Ice Teh Tarik, it was very common, no tea pulling (Teh Tarik) action at all even I mentioned it. Charging at $3.30 is way too expensive. Not worth it. Teh Tarik no Tarik. So shame.\n\nOverall, $6.50 for fried instant noodle with little mutton meat. Delicious and worthy.\nThen 4 items of Indian Rojak at $8.70. Fair. But can be better.\nIce Teh Tarik with Tarik cost $3.30. Not worth it.\nTotal cost $18.50. $$$$\n\nHonestly, Not recommended to pay a special visit. Unless you stay around that area.",

The fritters were fresh, crisy n yumz. The sauce could b less starchy and a little stronger & sweeter. On d whole, still good. Thanks.",
