Xunxiang Li,5,"Best coffee at the best prices available in Tanglin Halt.

The owner is friendly and makes the effort to remember your order. Coffee has a well roasted, smoky taste to it. The taste of the leaves come out well too for its tea, especially when you choose the less sweet option.

A beloved institution amongst residents, who always yearns for his return during his holidays.

Would have given them 6 stars if Google had this option.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107614721711928626234/reviews

C Brusselssprouts,5,"My colleagues and I were full of praises for their iced lemon tea (and with the option to have it with plum)! So so refreshing on a hot day! Rarely get iced lemon tea like that from coffee shops. Usually, they are made from that standard commercial syrup. The aunty taking orders was also someone who could joke, not your regular grumpy aunty. ðŸ˜„",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112641818247031183560/reviews
