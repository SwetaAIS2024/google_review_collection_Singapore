Michelle Chinatsu Khoo,5,"Trippi Bar is a hidden gem at the roof top of Hotel Jen Orchard Gateway! The tiki-inspired decor with absolute tropical vibes creates an inviting and relaxing atmosphere. The drink selection is fantastic and the cocktails are not only visually stunning but also incredibly refreshing !! Especially the green frozen drink I had, which was a perfect mix of flavors.

The staff is friendly and attentive adding to the overall great experience. Whether you’re looking to chill by the pool or enjoy a lively evening, this place is a must-visit. Highly recommend!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107652050186657467962/reviews
