spArk,1,"Honestly if you're enrolling your child to this school for his/her Sec 1 school after your PSLE results come out, please reconsider your choices asap...

Visited to the school multiple of times and all of them weren't even good expriences. The facilities are dirty, basically everywhere is dirty. My daughter went to the General Office and the people working there will force you to say a 'good morning' to them so that they'll take your request. Teachers are okay, but students are the worst among what I stated.

Manjusri students don't have any self-awareness on how to act mature and are basically just childish. My child from this school is just Secondary 1 and she has already been complaining about her school 24/7, said that all the students kept screaming and shouting and she has very sensitive hearing... There is a lot of biasism in this school, INCLUDING THE TEACHERS. Students will judge you based on how you behave, how popular you are and how you look. And confiscating phones just so my child can contact me on how she's doing? Horrendous.

Please educate your students please! My daughter and I were so disppointed with this school... Luckily I still have my son taking PSLE this year....",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115598701936910810740/reviews
