She is that type of person that we say 没家教 or kurang ajar. Over the years, whenever I happen to be in the area of Arab Area, I patronize the store, I always feel disgusted by that woman.",

      "text": "My utmost favourite is the kaya swiss roll. Best Kaya Swiss Roll I’ve tried made of authentic real good old days kaya that tastes like what my late mother used to make at home. Brings back good memories. I’ve also tried the other flavours like Chocolate, Strawberry & Pandan Cheese. Looking forward to try more. The sponge cake is dense yet soft and not dry and the filling is generous, good quality ingredients (not just butter cream) not too sweet and very satisfying indeed. Always a hit at gatherings with the kids and adults alike. Keeps well and fresh in the fridge for 2 days. Affordable at $12 per roll and value for the price you pay.",

There are no seatings as well only for takeaway.\n\nThe cakes were very soft and spongy. Quite good. I had the chocolate and Kaya. Gotta eat within three days as they don’t use any preservatives.",
