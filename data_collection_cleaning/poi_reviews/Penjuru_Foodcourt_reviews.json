Food quality is also outstanding especially the western food and the soup.",

The fried horfun was sooo good - amazing flavours and texture with a lingering wok hei with every bite. It was good to the very last bite. At $5.50, the portion was good for two if you're not a big eater. So satisfying that I'm definitely coming back for more.",

Clean and well-ventilated with a good selection of food. The soup was good and quite similar to Ah Er. Also tried the China food stall which offers a spread of ready to eat dishes and cook to order food. Filled with beer drinkers at night. Staff are quick to clean tables.",
