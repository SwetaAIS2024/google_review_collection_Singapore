Frank Pang,5,"20250322 - 4 min walk from tanjong pagar mrt. As prestige member, i was given early access to club lounge at 11 am, room checkin around 1130 am. Booked deluxe and was upgraded to club room on same floor as club lounge. Room was spacious, shower, bed, aircon was comfy and wifi good for gaming. Both club lounge and hotel breakfast cafe serves really good food and kudos to the chefs! Managed to get 1 hour late checkout and highly recommended to stay here!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113667207290836871919/reviews
J Mac,4,"It's good that they have family themed rooms. The suite room was very spacious. However, we find the call centre service can be improved. There were instances that requests weren't followed properly. The lounge selection of tidbits can also be improved to add more variety. Overall, it's still a good stay.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117270987381125148066/reviews
K,4,"The reception should provide info about opening hours for all the services on paper. The room is spacious and clean. One time when I entered the room the light was on, which scared me since I had to confirm that no one was hiding in the room. It seemed the cleaner left their card, some towels were changed but tea wasn't replenished, and they never came back. On the lounge floor, the lounge service was amazing though there aren't so many choices for food. Breakfast on the ground doesn't taste so good and because it's too busy I couldn't feel relaxed in the morning. Some staff were very desperate to take plates out even though food wasn't finished. Every time I tried to get some food they cleared out my table and reset knives and stuff. They offer a pool too, which is nice. The room was very comfy. Overall it was a great experience staying there.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118312489230589406195/reviews

Eddie Yumeng Wang,4,"Great location - could easily walk to hawkers, restaurants, and transit within 10 to 15 minutes. We took grab mostly and there was convenient drop off pick up in back side of hotel.

Breakfast had good selection of local flavors but was really busy everyday during our stay. It was hard to find an open table. But staff worked really hard to make it work for us.

Room was big and beds were firm. Tv and control box technology were nice features.

However the room and especially the washrooms were older and needs some renovating to keep up with other hotels.

Also I would recommend there be several locations added in the hotel where guests can access filtered water. The current system is not guest friendly - filling up water from the bathroom is not desired by guests. This needs improvement. We ended up buying bottled water everyday because of this inconvenience.

Overall I rate this hotel 4.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101273870412185790956/reviews
