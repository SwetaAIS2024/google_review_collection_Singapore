The nasi is fragrant and well seasoned 👍🏻 the chicken wings was fried perfectly 👍🏻👍🏻 the sambal is sweet and a little tad spicy which suit my taste 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 the egg is also cooked perfectly! As it is runny 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 curry veg is well seasoned and very fragrant! Last but not least, what I love most is the free flow batter crumbs! 😋😋😋😋😋\n\nOverall, it is a satisfying meal and will definitely come back again",

More importantly,  the chicken wing and fish fillet was crispy and hot. Thi is probably my first time having a hot and crispy fish fillet in all the nasi Lemak (or equivalent) shop I've tried!",

Costs $4.10.\nLater, I realised that their Set A of Nasi Lemak with the similar added egg, chicken wing costs only $3.\nI was babbled...is beehoon more costly than coconut rice?\nMoreover, the portion is so small, like 5 mouthfuls for big eaters.\nI asked the server for the cost of the items, she replied, \"Yours is a Set D\"",

      "text": "These chicken wings are nothing short of perfection. From the moment they arrive, the golden-brown exterior gleams with promise, hinting at the crispy bite that awaits. One crunch, and you’re hooked—the skin crackles with a satisfying crisp, revealing succulent, perfectly tender meat inside. Each wing is fried to an impeccable crispness, yet never oily, offering the perfect balance between crunch and juiciness.\n\nThe seasoning is masterful. A harmonious blend of spices gives the wings a depth of flavor that’s both bold and nuanced. There’s a subtle heat that builds gently, followed by a hint of garlic and a touch of sweetness that keeps the palate intrigued. It’s a flavor explosion that doesn’t overpower the chicken but elevates it, allowing each bite to shine.\n\nWhether served plain, drenched in a tangy buffalo sauce, or glazed in sweet and spicy honey BBQ, these wings never disappoint. The sauces complement the wings perfectly, offering layers of flavor without masking their natural taste. The meat practically falls off the bone, and each bite is a testament to culinary craftsmanship.\n\nSimply put, these are the best chicken wings you’ll ever taste. They’re more than just a snack—they’re an experience. A dish that turns something simple into something extraordinary, leaving you craving for more with every single bite.\n\nHope this conveys the top-tier experience you’re looking to express!",
