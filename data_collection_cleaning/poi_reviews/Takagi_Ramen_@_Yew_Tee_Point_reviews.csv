R Tan,3,"Had their karaka ramen again today . Think they served me the wrong ramen? What i got today was different from what i had preciously. The karaka i ate previously had a spicy orangey coloured soup..considered asking the staff but finally decided against it, as the staff on duty wasnt too approachable.
