Sten (Piqued Wanderer),5,"One of the hidden mosques around. Has limited space but it is fully functioning as a mosque.

We chanced upon the mosque when we were heading out to another mosque. For the younger gen, jz fyi, this mosque has been around since the before 1900.. which makes this, one of the oldest mosque around.

They had gone thru several reconstructions and maintenance programs and is still standing strong here. Located near to Bedok Corner, shop keepers and assistants visit this place frequently for their 5 daily prayers and more.

We are smitten by the past that we had visited this place in the past.. and with our parents with whom may not be around. So ya, do drop by and reminisce along with us for these memories, you had with your loved ones..

Cheers!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115011929186540431052/reviews
Amar Koul,5,"Alhamdullilah. Visited this masjid for Subuh after visiting it for a solemnisation ceremony many years ago. I see that it still retains its community vibe, with lots of families & friends gathering in common spaces (in accordance to SMM). The prayer hall and the ablution area is clean & very well-maintained. Highly recommended for anyone who’s around in the area & wants to perform your fardhu prayers.

For drivers, there’s streetside parking at Jln Bilal although it can be quite hectic during peak hours. I’m not sure of alternatives but there seems to be a lot of private residential estates around which you can check out.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100276120372481396557/reviews

Jasim uddin,5,"The place of peace. Masallah is a very clean mosque. In the ‘60s, this masjid was one of the important symbols for the villagers living in kampung around Bedok. Built in 1883, this single-storey masjid has gone through several renovations. It now serves a handful of residents living nearby as well as in the East. With a capacity of 400 worshippers, the masjid holds regular religious classes.
You can go there by Bus-14, 45, 10. The nearest MRT station is TANAH MERAH station.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102739945804248884111/reviews
