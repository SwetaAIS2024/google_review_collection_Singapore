I like how they were able to make small talks with us because the cats were asleep, so we had to entertain ourselves. And the drinks are so good! I had the cafe latte, and i know it sounds basic but I really enjoyed my time here. ü´∂üèΩ",

      "text": "Cat therapy at its finest. Not rushed, not swamped with cats, but just enough to see them in their relaxed home environment. They even put up a guide for cat preferred locations to pat, which people must agree to following as the cats have their likes and dislikes. There's also a safe retreat area for cats not in the mood for patting and gawking. Meanwhile the food is prepared nicely and the staff are incredibly patient and kind to foreigners.\nI went here with my newly-wed wife who recommended we go here. It is pleasing to anyone with need of cat-therapy.",
