Samantha Phoon,2,It's a small area. Shady places with trees and have 2 seating areas. Entrance is double gate. But  the gates are difficult to lock from inside the dog run.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108626552430546767628/reviews
Okubo Noriko - Yenny (Lele),1,"Poorly maintained, dirty and full of dried leaves. The ground is so muddy and a lot of mozzies.. A lot of dog owners rather bring their beloved dogs walk around the estate than being confined in that small fitness corner. It's not even a park !",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118175370342448874856/reviews
Mr Gb,2,"3 years ago I would have given it a 5 star. It is one of the rare dog parks around in sg. Residents put up special request and the Mp agreed to build a mini dog park. However the lack of maintenance and irresponsible dog owners have brought this place down. Still, it is a dog park tt allows dogs to roam freely.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109666682186161769198/reviews
TBE,1,"I thought I heard dogs barking early every morning. It was actually a group of aunties talking loudly while exercising. Everyone else needs a break! Please turn down the volume. Always alone, talking nonsense about other people. Go make noise somewhere else and don't disturb other people's sleep. Please shut your mouth and exercise. Don't bark.

Organizer please keep your music down, and control the crowd please. Tell them can talk not shout!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115474558984168631098/reviews
