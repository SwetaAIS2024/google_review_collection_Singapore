      "text": "My friends and I recently had the pleasure of enjoying an incredible platter of nasi ambeng, and it was nothing short of a feast for the senses. Served on a large platter, the generous portions and variety of dishes made it a truly communal and satisfying meal.\n\nThe beef rendang was rich and tender, slow-cooked in a flavorful blend of coconut milk and spices. The sambal goreng was a delightful mix of tempeh, tofu, and long beans, adding a slightly spicy kick to each bite. The curry chicken was tasted and flavourful.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the sambal‚Äîspicy, slightly sweet, and packed with depth. It tied all the elements together, making each bite even more satisfying. The portions were generous, ideal for sharing, and the balance of flavors made it a well-rounded meal.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for an authentic, delicious nasi ambeng experience, this is definitely a must-try. Whether you‚Äôre dining with family or friends, the combination of flavors, textures, and aromas makes it an unforgettable meal.\n\nNot to forget, they also do takeout and they delivered my food timely, as per scheduled.\n\nHighly recommend! ‚≠êÔ∏è",

      "text": "I‚Äôve been having Nasi Ambeng from Adil Co Nasi Padang for Ramadan almost every year for the past 5 years that it‚Äôs almost becoming a tradition. I‚Äôm never disappointed by the quality. Whenever someone ask me where they should get Nasi Ambeng, Adil Co Nasi Padang is always on my recommended list.\n\nWhen you taste the food, it feels like it was made by a makcik that would call you ‚Äúsayang‚Äù. But nope, it‚Äôs by a nice smiley guy in his late 20s/early 30s.\n\nThe portion of the dishes included in the Nasi Ambeng set is generous, you always have leftover portions of the dishes when you finish the rice. Usually it‚Äôs the other way around.",
