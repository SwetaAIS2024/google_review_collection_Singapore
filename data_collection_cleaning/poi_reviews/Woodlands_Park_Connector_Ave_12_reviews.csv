CK Cheong,3,"This is an easy road side trail along Seletar Expressway and Woodlands Ave 12. It is not the most conducive of trails as there is limited greenery and quite a bit of traffic on the roads. Ok for walking, jogging or walking the dog. The trail could take an hour or so if you walk from Singapore Sports School to Gambas Ave.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114524725497942089541/reviews
Mohd Radzi,5,"I would use this park Connector to achieve my ten thousand steps on a regular basis. From my place at Woodlands Street 82, I enjoy a good uninterrupted walk as I make one big loop back to my block. I like the green sceneries along Woodlands Ave 12 and the stretch along the SLE. Stay healthy everyone. Cheers.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112044648256150401974/reviews
