Wapangrenba “Wapang” Imchen,5,"I had the pleasure of attending the Karen Baptist Church Singapore service here and I must say, the experience was truly heartwarming. The church exuded a warm family environment that instantly made me feel welcomed and embraced.

The ambiance of the church was not only spiritually uplifting but also aesthetically pleasing. The atmosphere fostered a sense of peace and tranquility, creating a conducive space for worship and reflection.

The sense of community was palpable, and the genuine hospitality extended beyond the service itself. Members of the congregation went out of their way to make me feel at home, sharing stories and engaging in conversations that enriched my overall visit. The sense of unity and camaraderie within the Karen Baptist Church Singapore is truly commendable, making it not just a place of worship but a community that embodies the values of compassion and fellowship. God blessed this beautiful church.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108278778183799414163/reviews
