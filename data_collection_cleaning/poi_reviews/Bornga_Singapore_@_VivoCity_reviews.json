The ambiance is warm and inviting, making it the perfect spot for both casual meals and special occasions.\n\nThe highlight of my visit was undoubtedly the food. I tried the signature Korean barbecue, and each dish was bursting with flavor. The marinated meats were tender and juicy, and the side dishes complemented the main course perfectly. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable, providing excellent recommendations that enhanced our meal.\n\nThe restaurant also has a fantastic selection of drinks, including traditional Korean options that paired wonderfully with our food.\n\nOverall, Bornga VivoCity exceeded my expectations. I can’t wait to return and explore more of their menu. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for an authentic Korean dining experience!",

You can choose set’s with different kinds of meat. Or pick out the ones you like. You get all the add ons here, it’s all included. Salad leaves, garlic, sauces, kimchi etc.\nAs an added bonus you can choose to sit by the water.",
