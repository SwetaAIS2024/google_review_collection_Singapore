      "text": "Walk in without appointment on a Thursday afternoon about 12pm. Philipino lady was very nice and meticulous. Gelish manicure (RM85) was done professionally. Then I decided to also go for classic pedicure (RM60) since I have time to spare.\n\nBecause I was wearing covered shoes, I waited in the shop close to 2 hrs (they let me! Very kind!) for my hub to be done with the kids at lego waterpark then come fetch me at the shop with my slippers. Raining outside. So I'm thankful for having me.\n\nVery nice setting, quiet spacious and very clean!\n\nIn the midst of setting up hair services soon. Hope I get to try one stop service in the near future! I will be back!",

      "text": "I had an absolutely amazing experience at Smoothy Wax Parlour Ghetto Nails in Eco Botanic! From the moment I stepped in, I was treated with so much care and thoughtfulness by the therapist, which truly made my visit special.\n\nThat day, I was feeling a bit lazy and just showed up in a simple long-sleeved tee, pants, and sandals, but the staff made me feel completely at ease and so well taken care of. I indulged in an aromatherapy facial, eyebrow threading, a hair wash with a blow-dry, and classic eyelash extensions—and every service was done with such professionalism and attention to detail. The facial was so relaxing, my brows were shaped perfectly, my hair felt fresh and bouncy, and the lash extensions were flawless—enhancing my features in the most natural way. The therapist’s kindness and skill made the whole experience even more special.\n\nI truly felt like a queen being pampered! If you’re looking for a place where you’ll be treated with genuine care while getting top-notch beauty services, I highly recommend Smoothy Wax Parlour Ghetto Nails. Can’t wait to come back for more self-care! Thank you for the wonderful experience! #pamperedlikeaqueen",
