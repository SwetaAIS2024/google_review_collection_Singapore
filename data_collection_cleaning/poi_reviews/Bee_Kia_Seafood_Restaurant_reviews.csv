Poh Soh Lee,4,"Famous for their beef horfun and har cheong gai, and we ordered exactly that.
Beef slices were tender and flavourful, paired well with the bean paste infused horfun. Though a tad salty.
Har cheong gai flavourful and crunchy but overly salty.
Best combo would be to have har cheong gai with rice, not horfun.

SZ Lim,4,"The food was served right after ordering as I came before the lunch time peak. I ordered the famous beef hor fun, which he charged SGD6.

Food wise there was a tint of wok hei, but not as strong as I expected from the reviews. I would say the wok hei hits a sweet spot for people who are not so 重口味. The sauce was surprisingly light, and the beef was tender. Overall a nice plate of beef hor fun and above average. But nothing spectacular and no wow factor.

Environment wise, it's bad. It's those old school coffee shop that hasn't been renovated, and the tables are dirty, even during non peak hours. Not surprising since there are only 4 stall open around. Bee Kia, a Malay food stall, a curry rice stall, and the drinks stall.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114108831723577323443/reviews
CK C,2,Their famous beef horfun was hugely disappointing. The beef was so overly tenderised that it had a weird texture. The so called black bean sauce tasted only of sweetness. Portion was great though.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
