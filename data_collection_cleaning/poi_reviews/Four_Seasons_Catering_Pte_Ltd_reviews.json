Adeline was prompt in her responses and was very friendly throughout.\n\nThe salmon was a little cold and drinks portion could be improved so I shared these feedback with Adeline and it was taken in good faith. Generally the food was good and my guests were satisfied.\nGood experience thus far!",

I chose Four Seasons because their food looks appetising from their photos, was very presentable - which did not disappoint me on actual day. Very please with this order and will definitely order from them again for other events/celebrations",

      "text": "I found their food through a Google search and was impressed by how delicious it looked and how reasonable the prices were. I ordered for 45 people, and they managed the food portions well—unlike some caterers who give more vegetables and less meat. I received great feedback from my relatives and friends about the tasty food, especially the Nyonya kueh, which was not too sweet. The rendang chicken and grilled salmon were also excellent.\n\nLastly, I would like to thank their customer service representative, Adel. She was kind and helpful in making my housewarming event a success. Will order again for future events.",

I got in touch with Adel and she was quick with her replies even though they were outside the business hours.\n\nThe packages was amazing. It came with a simple but classy decoration and the menu available was extensive and what we chose was delicious! Our guests sang praise for the tastiness and selection of dishes. There was even a Halal cetificate presented for ease of mind.\n\nWe are very thankful for the service provided by Adel and the Four Seasons team. We will definitely recommend and engage Four Season again.",
