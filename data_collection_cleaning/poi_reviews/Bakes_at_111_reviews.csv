Jessie NG,5,No regrets accepting the invitation to this rare hideout. Cosy place to dine in. The aroma of fresh bakes fills the place and is a constant surprise to await what’s served next. Can’t think of a better way to spend a leisurely Sunday afternoon. Looking forward to what else the baker has up her sleeve.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100902456276202991818/reviews
