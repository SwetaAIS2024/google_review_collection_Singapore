Angel Neo,4,"Fantastic lunch experience at Taki!
The Value Lunch Set ($19.80++) is a steal - delicious food, generous portions, and beautiful presentation.
PAmbience is cozy and elegant, perfect for a business lunch or catch-up with friends. Happy hour deals are impressive too - 2 drinks for $22 and buy 3 get 1 free on spirits/wine.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104392882645878435058/reviews
Catherine Chan,4,"If you are working in CBD and looking for a place to chill with your co-workers or friends after work, Taki bar is a great option. Set against a backdrop of Torii gates which momentarily transport you to Japan, it is an Izakaya üèÆ which serves affordable Japanese fare like donburi and maki rolls. We tried their Kaisen Don, Bara Chirashi Don, Dragon üêâ maki roll which contained prawn tempura (not dragon meat üòÇ) with a topping of sliced avocado and salmon sashimi, and Tori Nanban. I personally liked their dragon roll the best out of the dishes we ordered. If you are dropping by for lunch, go for their value lunch sets at $19.80++ and on Fridays, you get a complimentary upgrade worth $6 and a FREE beer or Happy Hour drink!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109237239705131758407/reviews

Honestly of cos it‚Äôs not on par with specialised japanese restaurant since it‚Äôs still a bar, but it‚Äôs a good gathering place with seats and a marina bay view, if you are looking for affordable drinks place with decent japanese food options‚ú®",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110396514254810116452/reviews
