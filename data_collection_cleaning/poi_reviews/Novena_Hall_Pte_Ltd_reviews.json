The cleaners did come and clean the floors, bedsheets and blankets, take out the trash, and also clean bathrooms.\nWhile a few furnitures are nearly old, and kitchen faucets and lights weren’t properly fixed, it’s all good.",

      "text": "DON'T STAY HERE I WARNED Y'ALL. This place is a SCAM!!!\n\nThe rooms looked NOTHING like what they showed on their website! The staff took weeks to reply to my emails, and their customer service is just awful. Honestly, the only good thing about this place is its location - it's near malls and the mrt.\n\nWhen i first arrived, the lobby looked nice and all, but the moment I stepped into the elevator, it smelled like CRAP. All the furniture was so freaking old and worn out, and the room was DUSTY and smelled so damp. From day one, the sink in my bathroom had so many DOTS OF MOLD - DISGUSTING. (i waited for 2 weeks to see if the cleaner would come and scrub off the molds, but guess what? they never did until I TOLD THEM TO DO SO) Plus, the light bulb was broken, and the shower head holder was broken too.\n\nThe cleaners came to my room almost every day, but all they did was only changing the trash?? They rarely cleaned the floor, let alone the toilet! Oh yeah, not to mention that the AC was barely working and my room was hot 24/7. One time, a staff literally had tp come to fix the AC at 11pm becuase it was so dusty and worn out that water was POURING down from it like waterfall.\n\nWhat's even more ridiculous is that they only had 1 washing machine for the whole apartment cuz the other one was broken (ig their specialty is ignoring maintenance issues), and yes they dont have dryers! They didnt even allow students to use the balcony. SO HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED TO DRY OUR CLOTHES THEN???? I understand that they had laundry service as well but sometimes my clothes came back with so many strands of hair on them that i had to rewash myself. I paid almost $1400 per month and these are what i got?? EWW!!!!!",

The staff doesn’t care about you at all, like how they don’t care to respond to any of the Google reviews.\n\nThey take so long to return my deposit and take so long to issue a receipt.\nThey give every excuse in the book to delay things. They don’t care about noise complaints. People pay good money to stay here, but everything on their website is a lie, the room don’t even look like the photos.",

Our AC in the room broke down a month ago, not only did they not repair it to fully functioning status, they refuse to provide each one of us (there're 3 of us in the room) with a fan/cooler.\n\nTheir attitude and ignorance in dealing with what is supposed to be their properties is not only disappointing but infuriating given that we have given them at least 10 reminders that the AC has been malfunctioning/turning on and off/making noises etc. They refuse to refund/repair/relocate us to another room.\n\nNot to mention other issues raised by other people who have stayed in Novena Hall. To those who are considering to stay in Novena Hall, this is how they deal with students and I wish you will not face any issues like us or else good luck :)",

      "text": "I do not recommend this place. I chose it because my school recommended it to me. I suggest you look elsewhere, try property guru, you’ll get a better room. The only redeeming thing is that it’s close to a train and bus station, and that the housekeeping staff is very nice, and friendly.\n- The hot water is not even hot, lukewarm at best.\n-  Facilities are old and outdated\n- The chairs provided are uncomfortable and old\n- The desk is not even smooth with all the “repair” work they’ve done on it\n- They take forever to repair things like the elevator going out of order, replacing microwaves.\n- Fire alarm goes off randomly for no reason. The building probably has wiring issues\n- You cannot cook!!\n- Fridge is small and even with the most expensive room you don’t get your own mini fridge\n- There’s leaks everywhere\n- The air conditioning unit is old\n- The staff is slow to respond and at times.\n- They don’t confirm your payment as soon as possible and will delay it till they feel like it.\n- They take 3 or more weeks to issue you your receipt\n- They don’t provide drinkable water from a water dispenser to the tenants and we would either have to purchase drinking water or drink water straight from the tap\n- There are only 2 washing machines for the entire building and it’s shared with everyone as well as the staff who uses it to wash the bedsheets\n- The laundry service can be hit or miss, sometimes the laundry comes back smelling like a dryer and not so clean.\n- Some tenants do not abide by the no noise past 10 and if you’re a light sleeper you’ll have trouble sleeping\n- The doors are old and thin, the frame is rotting at the edges\n- Sounds from the hallway can be easily heard from your room like the microwave, washing machine, people talking or on loudspeaker calls\n- They don’t change the shower curtains so you’re left with a mouldy shower curtain\n- The fixtures are old and sometimes rusty\n- You are only allowed to connect 2 devices to their Wi-Fi at all times.\n- The Wi-Fi would randomly disconnect or have problems which will take hours to fix\n- The bedsheets, blankets and pillowcase are often stained, bleached or torn in certain places.\n- Wardrobe is musty smelling.\n- The bathroom has mold\n- They have a bug and house lizard problem.\n- The 2nd floor fridge breaks down and they don’t fix it immediately\n- They do not take covid seriously. Complains on tenants who have symptoms are not taken seriously.",
