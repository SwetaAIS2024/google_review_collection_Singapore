We booked for the rooftop L7 and I thought it was an affordable and nice place to celebrate any occasion. The rooftop is vibey and aesthetic at night and I heard you can even do bbq during the day.\n\nOn the other hand, the karaoke room needs a lil cleaning and so does the toilet. The service team could be a little bit more responsive but all in all its good.\n\nBig thanks to Isaac for helping with the setup of the venue!",

Great supplies and entertainment options (racing sim, karaoke, board games, ps4, poker table, mahjong etc.), it even came with some snacks and drinks and a lot of decorations that were set up before hand.\n\nThe 2 staff James and Nicole also helped us clean up at the end and were extremely helpful throughout the booking. Overall 10/10 I will 100% be booking back with them another time.",
