An Instagram ad promoted what seemed like a free modeling workshop, but after clicking the link (which led to a WhatsApp chat), they pushed hard for me to bring my child without ever mentioning a fee. Once we arrived, they suddenly asked for over $50. If theyâ€™d been upfront about the cost, I wouldnâ€™t have wasted our time. It seems the lack of transparency is intentional to get more clicks.",

They don't receive proper catwalk training, and the agency seems focused on convincing parents to sign up $398 each time for unlimited in-house events. I wonder how many kids actually get jobs after signing up with Impact Model. We signed up for two years, but it feels like we're just paying for the in-house events.",
