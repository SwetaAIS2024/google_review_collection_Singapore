Got their
- Signature Injeolmi Bingsu ($17.90)
- Oreo Waffle ($9.20)
- Honey Yuzu Tea ($5.50 cold)

Love their Signature Injeolmi Bingsu - soy bean powder, rice cakes, Korean sweet red bean, crunchy nuts on fluffy millk sorbet! Shaved ice is so fine and milky it melts in your mouth. One spoon, take you to heaven. üòã

Oreo Waffle - served warm and crispy! There are oreo chunks even inside the waffle batter too! Yuzu drink is refreshing üòç

Best for sharing but they also have single cup bingsu in petite size for single diners. Check out their ongoing promotion üëèüèª",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112701474427268051638/reviews
Sera // IG: diningwithsera,4,"This authentic Korean dessert cafe is a nostalgic favourite for many that serves up a variety of bingsus (available in both shareable & single-cup sizes), waffles, & drinks!

We had their green tea bingsu ($16.90), which was made with premium green tea from Hadong, Korea. It features finely shaved ice topped with a rich green tea sauce, ice cream, red bean, & almond bits. Liked how this wasn‚Äôt overly sweet or jelak. If you enjoy a green tea & red bean combo, this is worth a try !!

Tried their sweet potato waffles ($12.40), which is one of their newer creations. This had a soft sweet potato mouthfeel. Waffle texture was on point ‚Äî crisp & fluffy on the outside, dense on the inside. Buttermilk might have slightly overshadowed the sweet potato flavour, but it was still an enjoyable waffle overall. They also have an ongoing promo where you can get a free hot green tea with every sweet potato waffle purchased on weekdays!

We had their dalgona cafe latte ($7) ‚Äî made with espresso, dalgona, & milk ‚Äî this had a strong milky profile with a classic latte flavour. The crunchy dalgona added a fun texture that gave the latte added sweetness as it melted. If you‚Äôre avoiding caffeine, there are non-espresso options too ‚Äî one with brown sugar syrup & another that‚Äôs just milk and dalgona.

Also !! It‚Äôs currently $5 off a Bingsu Combo Meal (includes a bingsu of your choice, waffles, & a latte)!

Will return for their bingsus ÔΩû",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118301436723641326928/reviews
Sarah Teo,4,"We got the mango bingsu, cafe Latte and sweet potato waffle. Quite a generous portion of mango chunks, and there were some cranberries which added a nice change in texture. The cafe latte was also quite good. The amount of ice could be reduced a bit so the drink doesn‚Äôt become too diluted. The sweet potato flavour wasn‚Äôt very strong for the waffle, and eaten alone was a bit plain but tasted good paired with the ice cream. Overall on the slightly pricier side but it‚Äôs not too bad if split among a group of people! A good place to go for a night out at orchard, would definitely come back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116466334919796064967/reviews
A2B in an EV,5,"Highly recommend the Signature Injeolmi bingsu. Lots of different textures and flavours that go well together - yum! It‚Äôs a large serve and easy to share.

Popular spot, we were lucky to grab a last table.

As closing time approached, staff were cleaning up around us but they didn‚Äôt rush us. Thank you!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102050510624352247259/reviews
Hien Anh Tran,5,"i love this place!! been coming here since secondary school days, and no where else‚Äôs bingsu tops this. while the prices have definitely increased, i still feel that it is worth the visit if you‚Äôre craving dessert at somerset. all time favs are the matcha and injeolmi signature. not a big fan of oreo personally, but all my friends love their oreo biscoff. it‚Äôs also not a very like atas environment, and sometimes the table gets sticky from old bingsu, but like nothing a quick clean (and your own bingsu) can‚Äôt fix",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109687966042903577310/reviews
