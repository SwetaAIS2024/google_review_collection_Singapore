      "text": "This should place comfortably in the top 10 Nasi Lemaks in SG. Portions are filling, proteins, especially the Rendang Chicken are done right. No basmati rice here, but the jasmine rice has good separation and mild coconut creaminess. Sambal is sweet and not too fiery. Sous vide rendang is fork-tender. No telor dada here or sunny-side egg tho. They give a jammy ramen egg which is a little out of Character. Located on the 3rd floor of Bugis cube. Seats are ample- not too crowded on a Saturday lunchtime. $15/pax.",

There are so much going on in this food; my taste bud confuses between the gulai, curry, spices, and all. Not saying its bad, just not to my liking. Perhaps next time i will order the regular Nasi Lemak, which i saw everyone was ordering it for their tables. See you next time!",

Also, the rice portion is small, so opt for full amount to enjoy it with the side dishes! This is probably one of the best nasi lemak in the East!",

Chilli nicely done and we asked for 2nd serving which was given with a great smile.\n\nGreat chicken to compensate for the sad meal i had yesterday (at another chicken shop as reviewed)\n\nSeems to be very crowded always.\nService was top notch from the team as well.\n\nWill be back to try other dishes as i think their spices are nicely done",
