      "text": "Your prata used to be the best I ever ate. I remembered having to queue 20min or more or my prata in a weekend morning. It was crispy with everything spread evenly spread out.\n\nToday, your prata is the worst I ever ate. Dough was thick (it should spread out), it’s not crispy too. This has been the experience for the past couple weeks such that I will give your shop a miss now.\n\nThe new king of prata is now at Senja hawker centre. Please go try them to find yourselves back. It’s a pity that you’ve lost the flavour that brings you success.\n\nI hope you will reflect deeply for FnB is cut throat industry. Whoever can’t survive will have to close, I do not see the next one to close is you for I’ve been supporting you for the last decade.\n\nNot sure if it’s a different owner but please go try the prata at Senja Hawker Centre. The queue has since shifted there.\n\nA prata is not a prata without the heart and effort from the chef. Anyone can sell prata but who can do it better?\n\n“If you are not meeting competition, then, you are creating one.”\n\nFrom: sincerely someone who wish you can do it better",

How does \"egg cheese thosai\" even sound remotely like \"egg sausage prata\"??\n\nI confronted the man who took my order but he only said \" No thosai no thosai\" and I have no idea if he actually understood what I said at all.\n\nDon't come here if you really want to get something specific and don't speak Tamil. Prata wise, Samsudeen actually tastes much better as well, and is more value for money.",
