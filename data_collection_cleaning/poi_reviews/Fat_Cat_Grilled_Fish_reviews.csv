AlexNicholas,1,"expensive stall, bundle for 2 $29?? felt scammed eating veggies and very little fish meat.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106023226129429339053/reviews
Joanne Pang,1,"Ordered 酸菜鱼 add noodles. Wanted handmade noodles but she said don’t have and told me to get the other noodles that is not maggi because it’s made out of raddish. But it’s obviously just maggi right?? And idk why but I think there’s yellow food colouring or something. Very unhealthy meal. The fish is very bad quality as well.

Taste wise, spicier than other 酸菜鱼 I’ve eaten.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109634316074807680373/reviews
Jen W.,3,Did a take away.  Ordered from their outlet at Koufu WEST MALL. Paid $12.60 for the set menu without fish tail for 1 pax. I asked to add 1 vege & black fungus.

Jor Wong,2,"Ever since they changed the stall operator, the quality suffered dramatically.

I ordered for the sides (one of it is potato) and paid $1 for 1 side, I was only served 3 THIN SLICES OF POTATO!

It used to have vegetables in it.

Please improve on the quality.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106589213286407219855/reviews
