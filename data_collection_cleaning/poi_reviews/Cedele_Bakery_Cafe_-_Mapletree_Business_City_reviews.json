The chocolate fudge cake and the carrot walnut cake are both very yummy and fairly priced.\n\nOne thing though, is that lunch times can be quite crowded, which will hinder service times and quality.",

Also going here for lunch although not regularly because the lunch queue is terribly long : they got only 2-3 staffs max to handle all orders and the individual create-your-own-bowl salad takes a long time to complete, resulting in very long queue.\n\nOther than that, the coffee and cake themselves are fantastic, reasonably priced when you consider the good quality.",
