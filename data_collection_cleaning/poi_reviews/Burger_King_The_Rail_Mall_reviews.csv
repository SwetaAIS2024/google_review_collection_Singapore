Aldiaz,5,"Service is quite fast, even tho i can see that staff are struggling. The burger was so good especially the whopper. The texture of the patty was so crisp and burnt with actual fire.
I love how the place was do clean, as a customer who is very nitpicky about the cleanliness, this store exceeds my expectations. I will definitely come back here again. Thank you Burger King!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104851950021472960976/reviews
