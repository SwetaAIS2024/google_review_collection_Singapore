aqilah natasha,1,"We waited for ALMOST 2 HOURS just to be told that the counters are all engaged and suggested to do online banking instead to open new account. The lady that approached us talked to us in a condescending manner. She did not guide us with proper information. We do not appreciate the lack of customer service. We suspect they only approached us because the bank was closing and they wanted to go home already. For reference, we arrived at 3pm but was suggested to do online banking at 4.40pm. Complete waste of time.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104723637965779103147/reviews
Zulfadli Waled,1,"Hi OCBC management,

I hope this reaches to you and that proper actions are taken.

On the 14th of November, at approximately 430pm, I came to the branch to deposit a cheque that was attention to my alias that is Zulfadli Waled with my address, while my legal name is Muhammad Zulfadli Bin Waled. After the teller Bee Geok wrote down all the details such as my current account number and contact number, she returned from the back office and claimed that they are not able to accept the cheque.

Bee Geok then called out her manager, Cora Enriquez who claims that she is the Service Officer to assist the situation but she also mentioned that they would not accept the cheque.

I have explained that the cheque is from Etrade that I have earned in exercising my stocks. I have even provided and showed transactional proof both on emails and the Etrade app but they still declined.

I understand that banks have policies that name on cheque and legal name has to be accurate but the fact that I have provided proof of my alias as well as transactions, banks could proceed with it.

I feel these actions were very discriminatory and racist. In the corporate and professional world, many has alias that they go with and i believe this would have gone through if it was a chinese or a white person. I can imagine how this would have been handled and processed differently if I had came in with a suit and tie instead of a tshirt and pants.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101948464664202959825/reviews
Chloe Lee,1,"Terrible experience. Never trust this bank's website explanation. I have SRS account from this bank.  According to their website, I can put my SRS fund to Time deposit so I visited this branch but the staff Randy (not sure, but he is in the booth 5, working at 9:30am 6th Sep 2024) just said 'cannot' so I said that your website shows I can. I showed him their OCBC website explanation from my cell phone at his desk. He read it and browse the site and read again using his monitor. He went to his colleague to check it. But he returned and kept saying 'cannot'. He never said sorry about their huge misleading. I've never experienced this kind of unprofessional attitude from banks. It's simply unbelievable. Totally waste of my time.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104403176287365817098/reviews
