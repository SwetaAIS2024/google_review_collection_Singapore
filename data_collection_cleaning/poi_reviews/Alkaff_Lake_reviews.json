Trail was great and it did not feel like it was nestled among the residential area. For a moment , I thought I was in a hiking trail haha.\n\nGreat way to destress and glad we came by. Second time here and still enjoyed the walks. Inside repellent is a must. Toilets are available too!! Plus point.",
