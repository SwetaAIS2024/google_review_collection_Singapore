      "text": "Do NOT stay at Hotel Re! in Singapore. The shower in our room had black mold everywhere—an extreme health hazard. It’s clear that it hasn’t been properly cleaned in over a year, given the amount of mold present. When we notified the front desk, they were completely indifferent and offered no help or solution. This place claims to be a 4-star hotel, but it feels more like a rundown motel experience. It’s probably one of the worst experiences you can have in Singapore, and the conditions here should definitely be inspected by the health department. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this place. It’s not worth your time or money.",
