Kelvin Yeo,5,"I brought my two kids down to learn Magic: The Gathering (I used to play many many years ago). The staffs were friendly and took the time to sit with my boys and teach them the game. Before we left, they even gave the boys some dice and welcome boosters, which really made their day.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111262745938819222967/reviews
House Chuah,1,"Very bad service.

I went for an event, the organizer didn't properly mark my attendance into the system and I was penalised for not cancelling the event. I went to request the shop owner to help me rectify the problem, but from their attitude, it seems like they are not willingly to do anything to help rectify the problem.

It is their fault for not updating the system properly and as a good shop owner, they should help out the customer in anyway they can becoz it's they fault.

I know MTG is their main income and other TCG is not and that's probably why they have such an attitude for this issue.

Plus they are also more expensive compared to other LGS. They charged $85 for Gundam Card Game Beta Box while all other shops only charged $80.

Think trice before spending your money here. If you ever encounter any issue, you can be sure they will just push you away with no intention to assist.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101646631512922095265/reviews
Jinfa Wu,5,"Just want to share my great experience which i had buying from this shop. Staff are friendly and willing to offer help in learning to play. The place feels cozy... and unique as it under ground... if I am not staying too far , I might visit more often. Worth recommending.üëç",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106537317073587187972/reviews
