Danny Chua,5,"Thank you Master Andrew,

I want to express my sincere gratitude for the revision lesson you held.  I attended it back in 2007, and even now, I remember how helpful it was.

Your clear explanations and the way you broke down the material really made a difference. I recall feeling much more confident after the session. I truly appreciate the time and effort you put into helping us prepare.

Thank you again for your dedication and for making learning so effective.

I would advise prospective students to take more than 1 offered course to get a better understanding of Chinese Metaphysics in general.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101912842103829672369/reviews
Cl Tan,5,"Just wrapped up Master Andrew’s two-day basic feng shui class, and wow—talk about a knowledge-packed session! Despite the short duration, the amount of info shared was both massive and super insightful. Master Andrew’s teaching style? He’s patient, thorough, and always ready to answer every question, no matter how many we throw his way. Plus, his sense of humor kept things fun and far from boring. If you’re thinking about diving into feng shui, this is the class to start with. Building a strong foundation is crucial, and Master Andrew’s guidance makes it all so much easier. Highly recommend!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100897412669350689076/reviews
