HAORAN ZHOU,5,"I recommend Yunnan Park because
Yunnan Province is famous for its unique geographical environment and diverse vegetation, and Yunnan parks have beautiful flowers, lakes, gardens and so on.
The park contains elements that showcase local culture, history or art. Including sculpture, architecture, cultural activities, etc.
The park has perfect infrastructure, such as benches, public toilets, restaurants, amusement facilities and so on. The park is clean, tidy and safe. Good service and convenient facilities usually enhance the visitor experience.
There are various recreational activities in the park, such as musical performances.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100515162841157836956/reviews
