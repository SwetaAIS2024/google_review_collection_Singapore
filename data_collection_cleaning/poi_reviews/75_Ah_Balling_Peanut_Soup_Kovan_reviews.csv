Suzanna Chia,5,I grew up eating at the original one in Beach Rd when it was sold by the old man. I read the reviews of this one month old Kovan outlet. They must have taken the advice and improved the standard since. The 4 mochi in not so sweet peanut soup was soft and chewy. Glad to have this outlet in Kovan mkt,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100978400400065968307/reviews
Eka Buyung Lienadi,4,"saw a neverending queue so had to try. Pleasantly surprised with a very soft Tang yuan texture melting in one bite. They have many filling options like peanut, sesame, matcha, red bean. The soup itself could be creamier, but overall satisfied.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108749183152658668929/reviews

Titus Chong,1,Terrible service shouting at customers and didnâ€™t know this is hawker stall or a new concept blind box ah balling. Ask which container is which say never informed to label so I got to go home and play a guessing game on which is which. Ah balling is good but peanut soup has a strong burnt taste.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115162234294825368438/reviews
Bryan Tay,3,"It was a very decent and nice dessert in the hawker centre, nothing very special about it and the queue was really long even at 2015hrs.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106836086325330248925/reviews
