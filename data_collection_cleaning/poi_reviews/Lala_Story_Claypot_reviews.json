      "text": "Tucked away in the bustling Fernvale hawker center, Lala Story offers a dining experience that‚Äôs worth a visit. The setting is quintessential hawker style‚Äîcasual and lively, though a bit warm. If they could just turn up the cooling fan, it would be absolutely perfect.\n\nFood-wise, it‚Äôs a mixed bag but generally above average. Some dishes hit the mark, while others leave a bit to be desired.  The broth is really a plus and the condiments are a standout.  .There‚Äôs not much more to say, but the key takeaway is that I‚Äôd definitely come back, especially on a cooler day when the heat isn‚Äôt as much of a factor.",
