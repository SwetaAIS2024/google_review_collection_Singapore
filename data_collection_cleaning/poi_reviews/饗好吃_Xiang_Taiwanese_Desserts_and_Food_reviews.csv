Edward Wong,4,Paid $29.10 for 3 persons lunch. The braised intestine mee sua has the authentic Taiwan braised taste. But the intestines were a bit salty. The salted fried chicken was crispy and tender. But there was a slight sweet taste inside. Service was friendly. Food was served promptly except the fried chicken noodle which took slightly longer. Ambience was a bit noisy but still cooling on a hot day.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173188680901424865/reviews
Wanxiu Hong,3,"Bad:
- Scallion noodles do not taste nice by itself. Slightly blend.
- Spicy Wanton 8pcs (红油抄手) is very underwhelming. Skin is too thick and a bit hard. Sauce do not taste nice also. I passed around the table giving the disclaimer. 5 of them were very sad also.

Good:
- Grilled Teriyaki Chicken was very nice to me. Very well marinated. Topped with Teriyaki Sauce.
- Nett price
- Chilli at the sauce corner was very nice
- Atmosphere on weekday lunch was nice. Not too crowded.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110963312973553536525/reviews
Cedric Seet,3,"Lu rou fan was average tasting, even by Singapore or Taiwanese standards. Milk tea was great, scallion noodles were amazing. Pork chop and dumplings were just so so too. Overall a very authentic Taiwanese place  with great service but food needs to improve a little taste wise. It’s not bad but it’s not so good that I would go right back or think about it.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116120424406667932678/reviews

S SS,5,"Yum.  First time eating food vs dessert.  Ordered the Taiwanese Crispy Chicken set, Deep Fried Pork Chop set, Taiwanese Braised Pork Rice, and a side of Taiwanese Braised Pork...
