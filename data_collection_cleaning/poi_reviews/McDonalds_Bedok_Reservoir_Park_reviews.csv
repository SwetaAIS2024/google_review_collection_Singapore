Dhruv,1,"Ordered a hot fudge sundae with extra hot fudge. They handed me a sundae with less hot fudge than usual. Even the ice cream tasted different but thats a whole different point. When I went to them to ask what had happened, they insisted this is the correct amount, and refused to continue the conversation further, rudely.

Usually a good spot, but very dissapointed with the food, and more so, service this time around.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114289994794334520378/reviews
Mickey X,1,"Ordered McD delivery because of the Cinnamoroll cushion, paid $4.80 McD delivery fee the item came missing the cushion and drink. Before I accept the order, I already inform the delivery guy that there is missing item, I showed him the list and he just told me the store just gave me this. Call the store and ask and he left. Is this McD delivery driver trained to just say this? They donâ€™t check when the store pass them the items? Called the McD number and they tell me they will refund the missing item, I am not happy, I bought the meal for the cushion and now I have to pay for the items without the cushion. Terrible experience from the store.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113535753790737803193/reviews
William,3,"This rating is mostly for the Ma La chicken seasonal menu which was so-so. Texture wise the skin is hard and tasted so-so.
The tater tots were not crispy enough either.
The filling of the pie is not specified either. Doesnt taste like apple pie. I still wonder what pie was it.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114916696399917166666/reviews

Joel Ng,2,"Waited more than 25 mins for my order for 1 simple meal. If you're in a rush don't eat the 'fast' food here. After it arrive, the cheeseburger looks like someone has stepped on it.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116915497246856709722/reviews
