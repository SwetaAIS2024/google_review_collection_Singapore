Yeoh Wee Chong,5,"Went for our 1st ever Art Jamming in our lives together with my partner to celebrate our 5 years anniversary together. Was extremely satisfied with the whole experience! The studio gave us a very welcoming and homely vibes and we were very comfortable throughout the whole session. We painted better than our own expectations and we never knew that it was possible for us to create such paintings! Big thanks and love to Sara for guiding us throughout, she is a very good and patient teacher who encourage you to try it out and discover your own talent and steps in to help when necessary! Would definitely recommend this to everyone planning for a date, events, leisure and etc. We would definitely come back here again!! Thank you Sara!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113410289399782663132/reviews
Audrey Yong,5,"The guided session was super fun and such a lovely date idea :) Our instructor, Isabelle was so patient with us and had such helpful tips for painting. The song selection was 11/10 and it was such a lovely environment to just relax and paint. Would def recommend and will be back for their Macaron Painting sometime!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109663802438801110908/reviews

Stefan A.,5,"I booked an unguided session for me and my partner! The studio was unexpectedly cozy. We had complementary WiFi and a great sounding bluetooth speaker that we could use. There were more than enough painting materials for the 2 hour session!

Victoria, who had orientated us around, was very courteous and friendly. She also made sure that we had all we needed.

Highly recommended as a date activity!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108431833124252753918/reviews
