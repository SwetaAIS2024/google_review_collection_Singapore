Hrmgr,3,"Considered expensive for a small serving. Obviously some items are prepared ahead and mix upon ordered instead of prepared in whole, given this is a dessert shop and not hawker stall. Tried the sago and is the same like those from a hawker stall. Was expecting of better quality but the melon was hard and not sweet though the coconut milk was very sweet.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews

Joaquim Cheah,3,"Desserts are sub-par, seems to be pre-prepared and reheated, served in plastic container, factory made, mass-produced. Yam paste was runny, not much substance. Milk pudding not smooth consistency, taste was OK. Almond sesame paste is decent.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118348943611987612181/reviews

Amrita M,4,"Refreshing and cool taste, perfect after a hot day.
Ordered 芒果水果龟苓膏 Mango Gui Ling Gao and 杨之甘露 Mango Sago.
Non air con environment, there are fans but it feels a little warm. It should be noted that prices are on the higher side.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104713673030109524936/reviews
