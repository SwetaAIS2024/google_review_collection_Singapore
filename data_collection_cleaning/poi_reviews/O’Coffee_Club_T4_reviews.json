The coffee is amazing, very rich and smooth, and the two gentlemen Akif and Muhaimim on duty were extremely kind and thoughtful and gave my mother a cup of warm water because she was cold. We'll be sure to visit again next time we are here! ðŸ˜Š\n***\nCame back after delayed return flight for late lunch, food was excellent, and the staff on duty were again very friendly and thoughtful. Great experience. Enjoyed the mud pie dessert as well. ðŸ˜ƒ",
