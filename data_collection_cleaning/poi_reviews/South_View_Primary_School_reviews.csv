Hoe Lee Neo,5,"I am a student of svps. the teachers there some might be strict, but some are really fun!! Overall a great school. Also one of the review is a lie.. in my 6 years being in this school I've never seen a cockroach. Probably the best school in CCK, highly recommend!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116045662555084085035/reviews
Choo Yi En Valerie (Svps),5,"I think South View Primary School is generally a very good school . It rarely has bullying cases and the teachers there are not bias at all and most of them are understanding,kind and supportive in what we do . But I do have one teacher that has been my form teacher, Ms Shaan for 2 years in p3 and p4 . She helped me score AL1-3 for my eoye . She’s also super supportive and kind . Ms Shaan is also very supportive even if we don’t win . She said at least we got in the finals . She doesn’t have high expectations and gone through a very challenging class but she did not give up on us , she continued trying to teach us .Thank you to all my teachers who taught me a lot of things , even though some things were challenging for me you never gave up on me and continued trying to teach me . I am very grateful !",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117670541936479123723/reviews
Kayden Lim,5,I'm a student of SV most of the teachers are nice and at the end of the year they let us watch movies and videos.The 2 corners of the boys toilet at level 1 and level 3 are dark and dirty but why did they change the level 1 to a MOE  kindergarten?,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111567359271850579020/reviews
Rosé,2,"Most of the reviews here are by students. If you want to know the reviews, you have to be careful.
All of the teachers are good, except for a few extremely bias ones. In order to be liked by all the teachers, you have to be a prefect, if not some of the teachers will treat you badly
