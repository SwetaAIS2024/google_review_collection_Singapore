Zu M,5,"Great ambience in a coffeeshop. Very quiet place tuck in the corner.
Food was great and awesome, the best part it's HALAL. Business is slow here. I hope more will come and try.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105401170580463117057/reviews
Suha Shini,2,"Counter staff was very rude and not interested to serve.
Food was average… not worth the visit if you live far away.
Food is halal so that’s the only plus.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102610611351858007903/reviews

Diana Surani,1,"Terrible experience after a grab food order. Delivery was ok.
All the 4 food items we bought tasted so salty yet with no flavour. All the pastas, grilled chicken and lamb chops were so darn salty, impossible to eat. The fish from fish and chips was tasteless. Only the fries are edible. My 1st and my last order from this place! Its such a waste of money and a great disappoinment!
I rated no star and please do not waste customers's money for food cooked and made of this quality.
Not recommended for human consumption!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112110456125403507898/reviews
Darwis Sunaryo,4,"Tastes good! 4stars on taste bcos its healthier option hahaha trying this stall for the first time via grab with my wife today. Agio olio + fried fish was just nice - not too spicy, good amount of pasta and fish! Truffle carbonara + chicken was good too - was creamy but a lil dry (could be due to the fact that it was delivered and not dining in there). Will patronise this stall again

However i find price a tad steep for a coffeeshop, but thought it was alright if i were to compare it with pastamania or sorts",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118374862307498459294/reviews
