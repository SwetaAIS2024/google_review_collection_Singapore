KKT,3,"A variety of noodle types to choose from and they are all long cut.. soup taste is mild but not bland. Pig stomach comes in big pieces, tendons are small pieces.. Table kinda squeeze, still ok for a quick meal.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
Princess Mania,3,Tried their signature beef noodle soup with thin noodles (small) which was a good portion for 1 pax. Soup was tasty but alittle salty. The lucky trio noodle (dry with no chilli) was also flavourful. Staff was polite and courteous.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107320587807657797918/reviews
L A,4,my favorite noodle shop so far. always ordered their Signature mala beef noodle (三细 with spicy cold beef n black fungus side dish. The very authentic and noodle is springy. the sauce for cold beef is superb.. though the black fungus seems a bit under average n quantity also lesser now. Overall still love this brand. will try other outlet next time,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114673216863430601048/reviews
Yeung Jasmine,5,"We order 2 Signature Beef Noodles (1 large + 1 small), and 1 Dry Chicken Noodles Set. The soup is hot and delicious while the sauce of the dry noodles is yummy too. There are 8 kinds of noodles to choose from and I would recommend ""Small Flat"" as it's very chewy and fresh. For the set, we need to top up $5 to enjoy an additional side dish, a braised egg and a can of soft drink. Quite a good deal!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114611266380229526266/reviews
Wing Seng Chan,4,"Came in a weekday for dinner. Not too crowded. The mala tendon noodles is tasty, although I felt the ingredients were too little compared to other outlets I have been to. Overall still tasty.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105552990408975757039/reviews
