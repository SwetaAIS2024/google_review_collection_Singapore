Ivy Low,5,"Communication with the guys at Quintet 5 was fuss free and smooth. The delivery guy was really nice and they prepared lots of plates/ bowls and cutlery with our order. Food tastes fresh. The truffle flavoured mash, mushroom soup, salmon and pork ribs were a hit with the family. Second time having the salmon and it’s really consistent in taste and quality. Thanks guys!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103469784960046351888/reviews
Lynn Kiyomi,4,"Order through a tablet. We had blue ribbon chicken roll $17.90 (hubby said no regrets for this), salmon veracruz with rice $16.90, beef ragu rigatoni $15.90. Had a good deal after Eatigo discount. Overall not bad although I felt the tomato sauce in beef ragu was a little too sweet for me and not meaty enough, although pasta was sufficiently al dente. Had wanted to try the beef striploin and bacon cheese burger hut both were sold out when we went for dinner.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113822835589002053941/reviews
LWS,5,"We’ve been a frequent visitor of quintet five ever since my son started drum classes at BTP. We will have our Friday dinners there, food is affordable and nutritious

We had a family party and decided to engage them for their catering, they were super accommodating and catered their menu to our fussy needs.

The portion was huge and everyone enjoyed themselves, the mini burger, the chicken drumlet adobo was amazing. Their sides was also very generous - highly highly recommend

Is such a hidden find in Bukit timah plaza",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114983514916184084774/reviews
Dan Ho,5,"We ordered the Baby Back Ribs & Beef Ragu Rigatoni. Both were awesome. Tastes good, texture was good. Understand from the friendly chef that all are made from scratch. Quite a few unique dishes for a seemingly small cafe.
Also got a $8.90 cake plus coffee deal, good for that one-two hours waiting for your kids to be done with class.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100625329464465706372/reviews
