Ended up 10 mins late and they cancelled my appointment just as I reached the front counter.\n\nUnderstand that it's not a cheap service but really? You're really going to reschedule me and waste my time?",

      "text": "Very good team! Dr. Kissun, Dr. Shwetambra and their assistant Ms. Lara are very good professionals ! I have back pain and I am visiting the chiropractic once every 2-3 week . It helps me a lot to keep the hip bones & back aligned . Back in the days, when they were located in the Clifford Center is was easier for me  to reach their location. But even now,  that they are only in Siglap I keep going to the clinic as it is really worth for me! Highly recommended!",

      "text": "I had a painful neck and back problem in early 2020 due to a work incident, so painful that no painkiller can bring relief. I was unable to stand, sit and sleep well. I was recommended by a good friend to see Dr Richard Kissun who helped his wife's condition.\nThis is the first time I have seen a chiropractor.  My first good impression over the phone was a patient Kelly who helped to secure an appointment on the same day. Dr Kissun was able to immediately relieve my back pain with the cold therapy and treatment on the first visit. After the x Ray, he patiently explained my condition and recommended the progressive treatments necessary to bring me to full recovery. A week plus into the treatment, I am able to be off my painkiller and with every visit my condition improved and I am now able to sit, walk and sleep well with no pain. Thank you Dr Kissun and your team.",

Great service from the front desk staff in booking the appointment (called on a Friday), filling up the form at the clinic - friendly folks and efficient. The consultation with Dr Kissun was personalised - heâ€™s very experienced, quick to diagnose the issues and suggest treatment and next steps.",
