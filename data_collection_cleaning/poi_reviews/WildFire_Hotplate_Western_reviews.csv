Theodore,1,"ordered through foodpanda and they managed to get every single order item wrong. even the simple chicken chop didnt come with the items advertised, i.e. fries, egg.

prawn pasta became fish pasta, fish burger became fish pasta, add on beef did not arrive, fries did not come.

food portion is small and looks sad. i have no idea how a food establishment can mess up so badly. if its a single item wrong or missing we can understand but its the whole order. do not recommend.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112622780792034654286/reviews
Ether Kum,5,"Just a stone's throw away from Commonwealth MRT is Wildfire Hotplate, your friendly neighborhood western-fusion stall! The flambe effect didn't cost an arm and leg (booo inflation) and the dishes were tasty!üî•üî•üî• The Signature Crispy Chicken Cutlet had the most satisfying crunch when I bit into skin. The tender fillet in the signature chicken chop packed impeccable flavor. Probably had a solid brine! We all loved the black pepper sauce that went with the steak and the Spicy Bolognese  was INSANELY GOOD! They've managed to get me to LIKE their bolognese even though I hate tomato-based pasta. TEXTURE of the pasta was perfectüëåüèΩ",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112542808870836717392/reviews
Vincent Cheng,1,"This is the worst steak my family and me have had, be it coffee shop, restaurant or home cooked. It should be called cold plate as there is no sizzle nor any heat at all. Steak was overcooked and tough, I need to see a dentist after this. The chicken chop is partly burnt. It‚Äôs a lazy and poorly ran shop that has unusually high rating. Pls do not be fooled and avoid at all cost! I had to apologise to my family for the lousy selection of our dinner based on google review, u can‚Äôt believe what u see until u tried it, and believe me it‚Äôs that bad.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112646915500061679412/reviews
Raphael Kang,5,"Had their signature cheesy beef Hamburg. Portion was big and for a reasonable price. Changed my fries to tater tots and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! They poured their signature fire sauce and I could taste the sweetness of it over my burger patty and tater tots which gave it a sweet tangy flavour. Loved it.

Would return to try their pasta. Owner is very friendly.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110172991217719580524/reviews
Xinyi Tan,4,"They hv a wide range of western dishes on menu, definitely good neighbourhood price tags for the huge portions. We liked they serve decent vegetables as sides too.
