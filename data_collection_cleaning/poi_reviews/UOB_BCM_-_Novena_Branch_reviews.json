      "text": "Opened a ebusiness account with UOB on 20 Nov 2023.\n\nWelcome letter is served. 1 phone calls received from various UOB personnel to inform me that the bank account is approved and just need another 2 days for the internet banking to complete.\n\nTried to deposit money in various way but unable. Call UOB to check. System does not show the account info.\n\nSuddenly I am told via an email that the bank account is not successfully opened.\n\n2 other phone calls received from UOB to upsell me only to realized they have no clue the account opening was unsuccessful.\n\nIs this how a renown locally home grown bank operate? Until date, nobody is replying to my 1-week old email. And the guy that last spoke to me says he will arrange Novena branch to call me and yet nobody call.\n\nWhat a waste of my time!",

      "text": "I went down to print my passbook because it’s been quite sometimes I never update, but the clerk at Counter 1, Sunarti Ngarip, asking for my NRIC which was not related to passbook update. And without explaining anything to me, told me to sign a tax form which wasn’t related to passbook update at all!! What kind of trap is it?!! Asking customer to sign a form without my concern at all and never explaining what was it about!!! And furthermore she just hold my NRIC and brought it to the back office without explaining what was she gonna do with all that??!! It took very long until the backend office staff came out and return back my NRIC!!",
