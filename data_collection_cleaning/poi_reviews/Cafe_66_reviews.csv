Yeo Kai Wen,5,"This stall is run by a grandmother and her daughter, and is super popular with the neighbourhood - especially for their coffee and tea. There will always be a queue and when it comes to your turn, be sure to be ready with your order, else you will be shouted at.

I'm impressed by their iced teh - the grandma prepares it from scratch and uses a milk frothing machine to froth it before serving it to you. One cup costs $1.30.

This is my to-go every time I visit this hawker centre.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105028782764100809863/reviews
