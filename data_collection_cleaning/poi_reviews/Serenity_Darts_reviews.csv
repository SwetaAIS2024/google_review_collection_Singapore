sh1nya,5,"Ruilin was helpful in giving advices and recommendations for the barrels suitable for me. The range of products they carry and on display is extensive and you will definitely find something suitable. They are also very patient in letting me try whatever barrels and set up, as long as I wanted.

End up going with their Imagine brand barrel -PKS and is very happy about the experience.
