      "text": "My Teochew stomach is very satisfied with this authentic Teochew dinner. We ordered their braised goose with tau Kwa, Teochew Chye Poh Kway Teow, Hae Zhor, In-house tofu with Shimeiji mushrooms and Orh Nee.\nThe braised sauce goes super well with a bowl of rice, a must try!\nChye Poh Kway Teow is wok fried to perfection and the wok hei hits you in the face as you pull apart the Kway Teow. So satisfying.\nTheir in house tofu is silky smooth, topped with gravy consisting of shimeiji mushrooms, dried shrimps and dried flat fish? Also goes very well with a bowl of rice.\n10 out of 10 will return.",

I would rate the food above average (8/10) but price seems higher than expected given its location and market positioning.",

      "text": "Nice to visit here for a sumptuous dinner again.. Nothing fancy.. very old school menu.. Love especially the pork knuckle jelly.. as hard to find this particular dishes and taste good. My another favourite will be the braised goose meat. The rest also nice. Price $$. Food nice but my favourite dishes even for 6 paxs ordered the middle size still look pretty small serving..\n\nRestaurant was crowded at 7pm.. difficult to get the staff to take the orders. And one more thing is very noise..  All this dishes we are having price likewise can eat in Long Beach.. if compared to atmosphere. But this old school thing not easy to get..\n\nYam paste to me too sweet..\n\nWe ordered the fried oysters but they said don't have..\n\nHope the next visit the restaurant can improve on the serving portion..\n\nLast to compliment is the serving speed is very fast..",

There were like a few walk in tables at the back as the front few tables, were occupied by a wedding engagement (guessing)\n\nFood-  There were three of us, one uncle and my partner. Cereal prawns, coffee pork ribs and home made beancurd. All three dishes were generally okay. More on the pricey side, for a restaurant in the heartlands. We also had some desserts.",
