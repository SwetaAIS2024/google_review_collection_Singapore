Bhaskar Singapore,4,"Ginger Tea one of the best I always try here.

Beauty of this Fun Toast is it has both Indoor and outdoor dine in options. If any feels cold can dine out side , if feels hot can sit inside.

Kaya and french roast breakfast sets are popular must try along with Ginger Tea.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118414779972405165627/reviews
