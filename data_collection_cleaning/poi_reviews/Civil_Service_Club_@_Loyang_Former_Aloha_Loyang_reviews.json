It was so disgusting. For customer service was good. We hope to see the management to do something about it.",

      "text": "The chalet is so run down.  Aircon is not really working.  Sofas got stain. Shower head holder also not working.  No small knife, no chopping board.  The rice cooker is rusty inside. Although got freezer, but the other fridge is small. Is not cheap to stay there.And the facilities are no good No choice as limited chalet with so 2 or 4 rooms. Why limit to only 3 vehicle passes. Unless overnight, then limit it. Will want to try out the Tee Side Chalet.  Am sure is better. Must walk to the  convinence  store to rent and return the MJ table for $38 for 1 night.  Is so heavy and the store owner  also not helpful.",

The swimming pool was fantastic featuring a child-friendly water playground and kids' floaties which kept the little ones entertained for hours.\n\nA big shoutout to the housekeeping team, who did a fantastic job ensuring our chalet was clean and comfortable throughout our stay. Our requests were attended to promptly, making us feel well taken care of. Special thanks to Mr. Guna, the housekeeping joint in charge, for his attentiveness and politeness. He was incredibly helpful and always ready to support us with our needs.\n\nThe resort also offers great amenities, making it an ideal place for both families and friends to relax and enjoy quality time together. We truly appreciate the excellent service and warm hospitality, and we look forward to returning for another stay!\n\n#rafibhai",
