The soup was flavourful and lots of ingredients- more than enough 3-4 person. The steamed fish was fresh and well-cooked.\nOverall, their food were quite good.\nThe place could still be considered clean.\nStaffs were friendly and nice.\nThis stall also sells canned abalone at reasonable price.",

Parking was easy in SkyTech building. - Stir fried beef hor fun (wok hei, marinated meat, right balance on the flavor) - Claypot noodle (fair amount of ingredient, generous portion) - 三捞河粉 (generous with fish and if saltier would be better - Sweet sour fish (generous portion, not overly sweet nor sour)",
