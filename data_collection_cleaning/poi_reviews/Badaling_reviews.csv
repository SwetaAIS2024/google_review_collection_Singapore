Su Fern,1,"We frequent the 2 adjoining coffeeshops along Teck Whye Avenue. This evening, because the coffeeshop that we ordered food from was almost full, we decided to bring it to eat at the adjacent coffeeshop (we sometimes do that for breakfast and the coffeeshop staff have been fine with that). However this evening we were shocked that while we were  almost finishing our dinner, an auntie staff from Badaling told us to shift to the adjacent coffeeshop since our food was ordered from there. We offered to order drinks from this auntie but she said she could not take our order and we got to get them ourselves. When asked if she could let us quickly finish our remaining 3 fried wings and leave, she rejected our request and asked us to leave IMMEDIATELY.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100991188435889978206/reviews
