Venkatesh Muruswamy,1,"Is this a Bangladesh club? The board outside states clearly it is Bollywood club .
However, as soon as you enter you hear Music that is not Bollywood. Instead, playing Bangla music and songs in Bangla language,
I mean one Bangla one Bollywood Hindi song ok but all Bangla songs? Why? Doesnt make sense? Not even one new song! Not even one Punjabi song. Not even one Tamil song, not one telugu song? Why biased towards Bangla songs?
I would never recommend this place if you know and are a fan of Hindi music ie Bollywood - dont be fooled by the name on the board outside!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106388800707500800256/reviews
