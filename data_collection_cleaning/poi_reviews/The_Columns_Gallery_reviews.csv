C,5,"The Columns Gallery, located in the serene and historical Gillman Barracks, is one of Singapore’s premier contemporary art spaces. Known for its exceptional exhibitions featuring emerging and established Southeast Asian artists, it stands out as a leading force in the region's art scene. Currently on display is Graffiti Alchemist: Journey of Knowledge and Chromatic Craft, a solo exhibition by French-Vietnamese artist Cyril Kongo. This show takes visitors on an electrifying exploration of graffiti art and urban landscapes. Despite being one of the larger galleries, it remains relatively quiet, making it an ideal spot for a peaceful art experience. For anyone seeking cutting-edge art, The Columns Gallery is a must-visit destination in Singapore.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
