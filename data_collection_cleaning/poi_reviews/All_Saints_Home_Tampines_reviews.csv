Kenneth Tay,5,"Mixed reviews. The home's staff is polite and experienced but what I wish to share is the attitude of the transport staff.

Appointment is made at 12:50pm to 12:55pm to pick up my mum for rehab. The transport came earlier and at 12:44pm, a transport staff with HP number ending with 0692, called my wife saying that they had arrived. On the phone, he sounded extremely impatient and says that we should be waiting downstairs for him instead. My mum was actually ready by then, we helped her to put on her shoes and push her down on her wheelchair within minutes.

Now I wish to know, if you are early, why do you blame us for not knowing you are early? What is the purpose of appointment time then? I brought my mum down with my helper, if you are unhappy, why don't you tell me off in my face? No guts to face a man and can only bully women, old folks and helpers?

Next, when my helper went down to fetch my mum up later on, someone (I cannot confirmed if he is the same person) from the transport team told off my helper and mum saying that he had waited for us for a very long time.

What is this? You had made my mum feels bad and keep apologising to me saying that she is not late. What kind of service and attitude is this?

Update: The customer service service is prompt and had contacted me to apologise for the unpleasant event. I am also in customer service industry and understand a person wrongdoing does not reflect the entire organization. Keep it up.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116236690922654089367/reviews
