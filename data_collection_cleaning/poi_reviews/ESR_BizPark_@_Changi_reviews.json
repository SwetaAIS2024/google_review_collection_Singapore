      "text": "I am very unhappy with an Indian security guard on duty on the 2 January 2025 at 9pm. I was resting at an outside common area enjoying a snack where there werent any indication no food or drinks allowed, just resting. Out of no where this indian Security guard raised his voice to me telling me I weren't allowed to eat and I shouldn't litter.... ( I didn't) He was being a very rude and unprofessional. If I was in the wrong (which I don't think I was) I think there are better ways to approach  me, and not shout across to me. I expected better services here and this is my first time ever experiencing such an incident. I hope action will be taken as such an act refect badly on esr bizpark changi business park.",
