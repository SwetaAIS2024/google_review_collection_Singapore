      "text": "麻辣香锅 MALA here is one of the cheapest in SG.\n\nTastes good & has a lot of options.\nEasy to park nearby, just park opposite at Block 435.\n\nWould recommend first timers to try 小辣 or 中辣 cause the con of this place is consistency. You might order a medium heat and get high heat. Small heat and get a medium. Unless you’re great with spicy food, then go ahead.\n\nAgain, consistency, if you’re lucky you get the really good Chef, the mala base is reduced and goes well with rice. If you’re not so lucky, you have a more watery base. BUT, even on its worst day, it’s still one of the best Mala, plus the price point.\n\nCan get crowded during peak periods. So avoid them to enjoy your food at your own pace.",
