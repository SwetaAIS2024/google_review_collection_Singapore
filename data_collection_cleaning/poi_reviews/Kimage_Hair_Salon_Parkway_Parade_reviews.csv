j j,5,"I went to Kimage Hair Salon (Parkway Parade)and had Irene as my stylist, and she was amazing! My hair was super frizzy and unevenly colored by another salon, but she completely fixed it, leaving it smooth, and looking so much better. She’s also super friendly and made the whole experience feel really relaxed and fun.
On top of that, she gave me a bunch of thoughtful gifts, which was such a sweet surprise. I’m so happy with how my hair turned out, and I’ll definitely be coming back. Highly recommend Irene if you're looking for a great stylist!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114767286713342076184/reviews
CHER WEE TECK,5,"**⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Amazing Hair Color & Exceptional Service!**

I couldn’t be happier with my hair color! My stylist Irene did an absolutely fantastic job—the shade is perfect, the application was flawless, and my hair looks healthier than ever. Not only was the result stunning, but the service was also top-notch. They listened carefully to what I wanted, offered expert advice, and made sure I was comfortable throughout the entire process. The attention to detail and friendly atmosphere made the experience even better. I’ll definitely be coming back and recommending them to everyone!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103383710272704255509/reviews
WL Wong,5,Walked into the hair salon without an appointment and came out happy with the service provided. Irene is a friendly and meticulous stylist. She took time to understand my needs and challenge of managing my thick and voluminous hair. She did a great job cutting my long and thick hair to a manageable short bob. Price was reasonable at $165 for a hair cut and touch up colour of hair roots.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109222177450584371099/reviews
Cam Nun,5,"I've been coming back to Irene for my hair for a while now, and she consistently does an amazing job! She really listens to what I want, but also gives helpful suggestions that make the results even better. What I appreciate most is that she always remembers my preferred hair color and cut—it shows how much she genuinely cares about her clients. I always leave her chair feeling happy and confident. Thank you, Irene!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108035152826083632033/reviews
Sarah Tan,5,"Irene was great, so much effort on her part to create the balayage I want for my wedding hair colour. Thank you so much for the sweat and effort! See the before and after pics (I pestered her so much after the colour because I realised that I needed a trim and also wanted to darken my colour a bit - she was very patient with me)! Definitely recommending her",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113878250308744066016/reviews
