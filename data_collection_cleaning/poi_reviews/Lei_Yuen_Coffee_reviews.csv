hy lim,4,"Good zi char stall. Updated as at Jan 8 2016, recently chef standard had dropped. We found the dishes very salty, this pattern only happened if there is a very huge crowd such as CNY, Mother day or father day celebration, Avoid these celebration day if you can!!!",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104567089917416145296/reviews
Adeline Tan,3,"Coffee staff always in bad mood so I wouldn’t recommend the coffee. A lot of stalls to choose from and I often patronise the noodle stall, roast stall and the Indian Muslim stall. Fish ball noodles are always delicious though the auntie/ uncle is not especially friendly.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117847261235892213991/reviews
cy 胡 (Spring swallow),3,"Convenient neighbourhood coffeeshop where you can choose from noodles, mixed vegetable rice, zi char, roast meats, mala, hybrid Japanese/Korean dishes, halal western/fusion and drinks.

Since a change in the operator of economic fried noodles/nasi lemak (non-halal) stall, i was told the economic rice stall cannot offer fried beehoon in place of rice throughout the day!

For lunch time, not unreasonable request since some people may prefer to patronise the economic fried noodles/nasi lemak stall. This avoids ugly and unhealthy competition under the same roof.

But even during dinner service, this limitation applies! Illogical since the other stall never operates beyond lunch.  Another restriction I was told is economic rice stall cannot serve up deep fried stuff! Again competition issue?

The most ridiculous logic to protect 1 stall, and deprive patrons of their right of choice?

So now, the economic rice stall at the other coffeeshop (aka Foodloft) can whip up fried beehoon, kway teow and run away with monopolising prices!

Time to vote with our feet and bring our precious little money elsewhere from time to time, isnt it?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111982899260126050368/reviews
kwek nelson,1,"Don't eat the store that take over JC Western at the most left corner that specialise in selling Fried rice (beside Zhi Cha store and Indian store). The EGG FRIED RICE COST $4.40, look at the amount. I am aware business is hard, but this is not the way to run a business.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103733932381355679609/reviews
Wee Liang TAN,4,If you like fish steamboat this is worth a visit.  We were there for dinner with my mother at my brother's recommendation.  The stock for the steamboat was impressive.  It was from fish bone and there were fried fish parts in the soup. It was milky not from any added  milk but the actual fish bones.  It was tasty. It was good enough to warrant another visit a week later.  It is a neighbourhood coffee shop so don't expect swank surroundings.  The fish pieces that came for us to cook inn the steam boat were fresh.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113482253549072588724/reviews
