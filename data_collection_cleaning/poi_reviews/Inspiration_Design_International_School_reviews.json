      "text": "As the Managing Director of Swiss Interior, I cannot recommend IDIS highly enough for their outstanding diploma and short courses. We recently sent 30 of our designers to attend their programs, and the results have been remarkable.\n\nThe courses are tailored to identify and enhance each designerâ€™s strengths while addressing their weaknesses. This personalized approach has not only improved their technical design skills but also elevated their ability to understand and meet client needs more effectively.\n\nThank you IDIS!",

      "text": "I am a renovation contractor. Speaking with designers have always been a difficult task in the course of my work. One of my objective for 2021 is to enrol myself into a interior design course to learn the designer mindset, language and working method. During this one year, i have learnt things that are beyond my own imagination and expectation. Now i can speak with designers better, understand their mindset and most importantly, able to differentiate a good design vs a bad design. I belief we can all bring design to a higher level as a interior designer or a hands on contractor",
