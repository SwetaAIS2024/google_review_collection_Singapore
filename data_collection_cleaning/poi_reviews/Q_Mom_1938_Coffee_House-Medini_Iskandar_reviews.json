If the shop can have some sound absorbing materials it will be great.\n\nWe had a mee siam with fried chicken and a meehoon fish soup. The fried topping on the soup impacted the overall taste and made it oily. The mee siam tastes good with the chicken also ok.\n\nNice place to revisit. The waitress was also very friendly.",
