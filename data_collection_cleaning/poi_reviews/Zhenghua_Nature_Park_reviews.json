Great path for cycling with kids, quite shady too and 2 playgrounds on our route coming from Eco Sanctuary condo area. Large long hidden grass area used by mountain bikers kept the kids entertained for a long time. Great if you're looking for a good walk or cycle and live in the area not necessarily a destination park.",

Be on the lookout for wildlife too so as to avoid running them over (eg. hens, roosters, chicks) or for your own personal safety (eg. occasional snakes). Also, because there have been wild boar encounters, you may want to take some precautions (eg. don't visit from 5pm-8am, make sure your bike isn't squeaky).",
