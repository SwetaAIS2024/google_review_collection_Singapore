Flo Yeow,2,"They're a legacy historic brand here at Lagoon. To be honest, this rojak is not something that can travel well. The sauces, mixed with the supposedly-crispy taupok and dough fritters, would have made the thing soggy by the time you're home (even if it was just 15 minutes). That said, if you were to eat there, I'm sure the rojak will turn out well. Uncle and auntie looks super friendly and passionate about what they're doing as well!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Saadiah Z Karimullah,3,Ordered $6 worth of bbq you tiao and tau pok. Came with 4 pieces of tau pok stuffed with bean sprouts and some overly toasted you tiao that became a little tough to bite and chew. The service wasn't that great either. I think three years back it tasted much better.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114392553358582160135/reviews

Tan CJ,1,"The cheapest portion for takeaway is bbq rojak is $8. For just simple bbq Rojak, I think the price is way too ridiculous.  I used to love their food but with new boss and price increment, decided to drop it from my must have lists in east coast lagoon…",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114845495831671548427/reviews
