Takahiro Koyama,4,"This popular open-air hawker center has major tropical vibes—surrounded by tall palm trees and full of open seating, it's super laid-back and breezy. Food stalls are set up in a big circle around the tables, creating a fun, social atmosphere.

There’s a huge variety of food here—everything from Singaporean classics to Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai, and even Western dishes. You'll also find stalls for drinks, fresh fruit, and desserts.

Some places serve fancy stuff like chili crab, pepper crab, lobster, and other premium seafood, but the real crowd-pleasers are the local faves like satay, chicken wings, oyster omelets, chicken rice, prawn mee, and carrot cake.

It’s a go-to late-night spot too—many stalls stay open past 1 AM, and it gets especially lively on weekends!

Kamilla,5,"My friend took me here, to get me to try as many local dishes as possible in one go, which turned into a feast. I liked all the dishes, but my favorites were the stingray with sambal, carrot cake and deep fried glazed sqiud (?). Delicious flavors and interesting textures all around. If I lived in Singapore, I'd certainly be eating out at hawker centers all the time.
To the surprise of no one, there was a lot leftovers, but they were nice enough to pack everything to go.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105750861063082404316/reviews
Bernice C,5,"Newton Food Centre is an iconic hawker centre offering a wide array of local delights. Despite its popularity, the centre has limited cover, so an umbrella is a must for rainy evenings, although recent upgrades include giant fans with rain sensors and adjustable waterproof blinds that keep the main seating area reasonably dry.

The lively atmosphere make Newton Food Centre a must-visit spot for both tourists and locals looking for an authentic, down-to-earth dining experience.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112058131064231215616/reviews

Always order the chilli crab when I visit newton.
