Ivan Michael Pung,5,"SO PHO……. So Good and here’s my review for the Novena Square @ Velocity

Restaurant : Very nice decorations / renovation works. It’s brightly lit 🌟 using lanterns 🏮 and has a wall of Vietnamese 🇻🇳collectables as decorations 🫖🗳️🏺and penciled on the floor are retro tiles. 🎋💮 Clean restaurant with a mixture of wooden 🪵 bench and metal chairs 💺 for seats.

Staff : Very Polite, friendly and approachable 💁‍♂️💁🏼‍♀️. Only crux is they are also using the self-scan QR code to place an order 🧾. I have previously mentioned that I don’t think this provides the best service considering they charge 10% service charge. Nevertheless, this is all made possible today with technology 📲. However, I’m just saying with the order taking, you will most likely be able to upsell me all the way to the desserts 🤷‍♂️.

Food : Wow 🤩….. What got me was the size of the portion that was served. 🤯 It’s huge! So for those who want to get your money’s 💰 worth, this is it! Lol 🤣 Quality? I’m unfortunately going to say it is not the meal that will make you cry-sort-of-reaction. But is it good? Yes, it is well cooked, ingredients 🐮🐓🥬🦐 are fresh, portions are huge 🍱. I think what it lacks is the Wok Hei…. the umami from the gravy 🥘. I think this feeling of wanting it can only be found in Vietnam 🇻🇳or places that use Charcoal 🔥🔥🔥 for cooking. You are not getting that here but it’s still pretty satisfying. So…. It’s great but it’s not gonna make you cry 😭 sort of feeling.

The Fried Vermicelli 🍜, Beef Pho, Chicken Chop Pho and Mix Appetizers are all very nice, no complaints whatsoever. I will advise those getting the Vietnam 🇻🇳 Coffee ☕️ to have it served later⌛️. By the time it finished dripping and when I was done with my meal, it was already cold. So lesson learned.

Overall, a good meal. What it lacks in Wok Hey, it made up on it from service the portion and price. 👍👍👍
