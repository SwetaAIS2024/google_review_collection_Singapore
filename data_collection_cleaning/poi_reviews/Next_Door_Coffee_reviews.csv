LiangKoon Lim,5,"5-Star Review for Next Door Coffee

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

If you’re looking for a coffee experience that feels like home, Next Door Coffee is the place to be. The owner, has created an inviting space where quality and passion shine through every cup.

I ordered an Americano, and from the very first sip, I knew I was in for a treat. The balance was impeccable—smooth, rich, and full-bodied without any bitterness. It had deep, toasty notes with a subtle hint of natural sweetness, making it incredibly satisfying. The aroma alone was enough to wake up my senses, and the finish was clean yet lingering, leaving a delightful warmth that made me want to go back for another cup.

Beyond the coffee, the service was warm and genuine, making the entire experience even more memorable. Whether you’re a coffee enthusiast or just someone looking for a reliably great cup, Next Door Coffee is a must-visit. Highly recommend!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106877878432749868405/reviews
melissa liew,5,"If you're looking for a cozy, home-based coffee spot serving up phenomenal drinks in the west (Clementi), look no further than Next Door Coffee! (conveniently located near the MRT as well; within walking distance!)

I have had multiple tries at her drinks and they impress me every single time :"") You can truly taste the love, patience, and care that Wylie pours into every cup. ✨

One of the things I love is how flexible she is — whether you’re looking for bottled brews to stock up for the week or a freshly made cup on the go, she’s got you covered. Perfect for busy days or when you just need that caffeine fix/mood booster!

My personal favourite has got to be the strawberry matcha: she does not skimp on the matcha!! the sweetness and tanginess of the strawberry puree complements the rich and earthy texture of the matcha so well — creating the perfect balance of flavours in every sip! an absolute must try if you ask me!!! 🎉💕

Beyond just serving amazing drinks, Wylie has been incredibly generous — she kindly sponsored drinks for a collaboration with my food account (@breadboidiaries) and even partnered with me for my school fundraiser initiative (@nus.projectiris). Her kindness and hospitality are truly unmatched.

thank you so much wylie! ❤️ for your generosity, love and passion into every cup of drink you prepare ++ the 100/10 hospitality every single time :^) i can't wait to be back already ",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105048789595602916935/reviews
Hax Mays,4,"Found this coffee home-based business whilst in the area. Thankfully it’s opened that day as they don’t open everyday. Order is simple via online and choose a pick up time. There’s no extra charge for choice of oat milk. Got a few cuppas for the family as well. Timing was perfect as the orders were done when parking. My iced white was good though a little milky for me. The hot white and iced oat were also thoroughly enjoyed. So for those in Clementi or its surroundings, please support this home based business.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115776232152336822036/reviews

Jenise,5,"Ordered their coffee and matcha a few times now and always as good as the last! Coffee and matcha is typically so expensive outside but here it’s very reasonably priced + good quality! Dad had the hot white and really liked it too. Ordering process is simple and owner is really friendly, do support them!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110266102815901808814/reviews
