So effectively, the sauce cost $6.40. It is a total rip off. I will never go back to them again. i can get the same nasi lemak with ayam mera chicken (which is bigger) in red ginger  (IMM) at about $8.\n\nThere is no doubt the price was clearly stated  but I was shocked I paid $6.40 for the sauce.",
