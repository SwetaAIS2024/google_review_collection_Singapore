Ewe Keat Huan,5,"Rating: 4/5

Overview: Tucked inside a boutique clothing store at Orchard, Plain Vanilla offers a cozy hideaway from the busy retail scene. It’s a charming, minimalist space that blends fashion and café culture into one understated experience.

Pros:

Great coffee & pastries: The quality lives up to Plain Vanilla’s reputation—smooth, well-brewed coffee and a small but delightful selection of pastries and baked goods.

Chic ambiance: Stylish and thoughtfully designed, the space feels intimate, with a warm blend of natural wood and soft lighting that matches the boutique setting.

Hidden gem vibe: Being part of a clothing shop makes it feel like a secret spot—perfect for a quick, quiet break.

Cons:

Very limited seating: Only around 4–5 small tables, typically for two people. It’s not ideal for groups or long stays, and seating might not always be available.

Compact layout: While cozy, the limited space means it's more suitable for a short visit than a full sit-down café experience.

Conclusion: Plain Vanilla at Orchard is a lovely, curated spot for a quality coffee and pastry break, especially if you enjoy quiet, well-designed spaces. Just be prepared for limited seating and a quick stop rather than a full café session.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103626082513610890905/reviews
Benjamin Seng,5,"I had a fantastic experience at Plain Vanilla! The friendly staff made me feel welcome right away.

I tried the strawberry white chocolate cupcake, and it was absolutely delicious ,perfectly sweet and rich. Paired with a cappuccino that was equally amazing, it was the perfect treat.

With a great variety of cupcakes as well as proper meals to have a nice brunch to pair with the drinks, I can’t wait to go back! Highly recommend!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105051612633781340348/reviews

J C,1,"Extremely poor hygiene. Multiple flies in the food display and landed on several cupcakes. Told the staff and yet they don't seem to care much.

Such a pity because I loved their cupcakes but this is a disappointment.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103344075493458059885/reviews
Gatsby,3,"Coffee is good.
Cake is just normal but pound cake is good.
Tables/ seats are limited but if you get a seat, it is good to take a break during a shopping.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104607839695805855739/reviews
