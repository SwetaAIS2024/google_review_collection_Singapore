Sometimes, we‚Äôre paying for ‚Äòtaste of nostalgia‚Äô, but the amount paid for the dumplings was not worth it. The last time I had these dumplings were more than 10 years ago, and they were plump and yummy. After today, I‚Äôd not think of having them again.",

This diminishing trade which seems that no where else has.\nSo for all the poor reviews, we cut them some slack.\n\nOnly manage to get the last of the savoury ones close to 1pm, sold out after.\n\nSkin is thin and QQ, Taste is still as good as I remember. So good the chill..\n\nLove the sweet versions, do call to reserve before heading down to save disappointment.\n\nDon‚Äôt expect service or warm hospitality, won‚Äôt be disappointed.\n\n$1.10 each min. 4 pcs at Feb24\n\nDefinitely coming back to satisfy my sweet cravings for their redbean & yam paste.",

The popular flavours runs out of stock fast and expect a Long que during peak hours. A traditional snack not commonly found today and this is an excellent rendition of it. Highly recommended a refreshing variety to another popular snack shop nearby.",
