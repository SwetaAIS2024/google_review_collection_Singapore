Oh, and did we mention the runny egg? üç≥ Just picture that rich, golden yolk dripping over every bite‚Ä¶\nBut wait, there‚Äôs more! We couldn‚Äôt get enough of the golden, crispy fried calamari paired with perfectly seasoned fries tossed in truffle oil and topped with grated parmesan cheese üßÄ. üòò",

The pizza was absolutely amazing! the crust, the taste and the thickness was perfect. carbonara was super cheesy and creamy, just the way it should be.\n\nThis place is one hidden gem that serves really good pizza and pasta. We‚Äôll always be back and will continue to order delivery as well. (But it‚Äôs definitely way better when you dine in!)",

Ironically the really good dish, I didn‚Äôt take a photo‚Ä¶ but the oven-baked penne with mixed mushroom & truffle cream was the BOMB. So good.",
