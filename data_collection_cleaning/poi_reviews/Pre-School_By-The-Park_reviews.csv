Sarah Ang,5,"One of the best decisions weâ€™ve made was to send our kids to BTP (LiHwan). Our kids get exposure in and outside of the classrooms. Nothing beats seeing them enjoy school this much! Big thanks to the teachers for making sure they learn the right values and to find ways to make lessons engaging!

Very thankful to the teachers and staff of the school - for having the kids interests as priority and for encouraging them to grow in their own ways at their own pace as much as possible. It is a VERY wholesome experience for us and i would highly recommend BTP LiHwan!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110454416903748051925/reviews
Justine Lim,5,"my both kids are here. one have been in the school for 2 years ++ and the other one just joined 2 months ago.

It's a great school, with good and kind teachers. the teachers are very respectful of the children. it has a strong focus on play, and inculcates learning through play. it is also very child led, letting the children choose the themes they can focus on for that term.

they have regular excursions out of school.

the teacher:student ratio is really good as well.

my kids also like the food cooked by aunty March! everything is cooked in-house ðŸ˜Š",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107751213447617122913/reviews
Liyong Low,5,"Really awesome preschool - It is like one big village where all the teachers and staff know all the children there and they are all so motivated to give their best for each and every single child.

Am also heartened that they do not only focus on the academics, but also character building and values.

Kudos to the whole team!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104647793613948132186/reviews
