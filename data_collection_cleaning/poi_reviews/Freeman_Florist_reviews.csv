Dawn Lum,5,"I called to inform that their mobile site was not processing my payment for an urgent flower order. Freeman Florist then processed it swiftly for me on Whatsapp. They also informed that some of the featured flowers were not available and I left the flower replacement in their good hands after listing the types to exclude. The bouquet delivered was beautiful and I could see that the florist was generous with the arrangement. Most importantly, I appreciate the fast service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112122524590627046454/reviews
