Chee Kiong,5,"Gem find in an industrial area.
See the opening hours, you know they don't need long hours to sustain their keep.
Also see the peeling of large portion of prawns outside their stall, you know their business is definitely good.
They even remove the digestive tract of the prawn, and the prawn isn't in half.
Ordered prawn and pork ribs, noodles were savoury, pork ribs were soft and the magic is the soup.
I find it very old school kind of flavour which I like.
Love it and will be my to go if I am nearby again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102894000794903429883/reviews
Jasper Teiw,4,"Very decent prawn noodles, especially being located in an industrial area! Their Minced Meat Noodles was savoury and really tasty, noodles were chewy and well coated with the sauces.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115866313306662601048/reviews
Rayant Yeo,4,"Most importantly, I didn’t feel thirsty after having his dish. Therefore, very unlikely MSG was used 👏🏼.

Located in an industrial building located on the Ground floor, situated in between rows of 2nd Automobile resale, Queue forming during lunch time.

Value for $$, worth to Q, (between 10-15min). I had the dry noodle version. The chili and sauce were complimentary to the yellow noodles, cooked perfectly. in addition to the amount of Pork Lard added which enhanced the flavours.

To wash it all down, sipped on the Prawn broth that has been brewing since the early dawn.😋

I will definitely return to this stall whenever I am in the area. 👏🏼👏🏼",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111160799570934501810/reviews
David Foo,5,This is some seriously good prawn noodles. I’m a fan of dry kway teow prawn noodles and this one absolutely hit the spot man. The soup is so flavourful and rich. I ordered the big portion for $6.50 and got served a generous portion of 5-6 proper sized prawns along with a generous dose of pork lard. Really a hidden gem.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103573249454833457288/reviews
