Looks like the staff changed because I was served by this trainee called Linda and she was super friendly. Super patient as I think I sampled at least 10 different flavours. They have all sorts of promotions, I bought 6 packets for clients and because of the promotion permutations I ended up with another 4 packets free lol.",

My friend had picked the kimchi and bbq flavour while i picked the sweet ones. They had the promotion of buy 3 get 1 free (90gm). I paid by KrisPay which has 6 miles per dollar back. Unfortunately wanted to pay with Grab Web3 but seems like this store was not capable of.",
