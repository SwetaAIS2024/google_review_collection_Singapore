The location by the marina offers a serene backdrop, and the new facility boasts a warm and inviting environment. The teachers are not only incredibly funny and engaging but also exceptionally nurturing, especially with young children and babies. Our little one adores every moment spent here, and we've seen remarkable progress in their development. Highly recommend this center to any parent looking for top-notch care and education for their child!\"",

We feel that our child has become more outspoken, confident, and sociable, and he seems to enjoy all the activities and lessons in school. Furthermore, we like that the school is clean and bright, and our child loves looking at the scenery of the harbour from his classroom. We are very satisfied and happy with Julia Gabriel Keppel Bay, and we recommend all parents to bring their children here.",
