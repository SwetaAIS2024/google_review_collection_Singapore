Toon Tran,4,"Cheers at HarbourFront Centre is a handy spot for quick shopping, whether youâ€™re on your way to Sentosa, working nearby, or just need a quick snack. Located on the first floor, itâ€™s easy to find and perfect for grabbing last-minute essentials or a bite to eat.

The store is well-stocked with a variety of items, from snacks, drinks, and sandwiches to basic toiletries and even some travel essentials. Itâ€™s a lifesaver if you need something fast without navigating a big grocery store. They also offer local snacks, which is a nice touch for tourists wanting to sample something Singaporean.

The staff are efficient and friendly, even during busy periods, and the checkout process is quick. The store is compact but well-organized, making it easy to find what you need.

Overall, Cheers at HarbourFront Centre is reliable and convenient, with everything you need for a quick stop. Highly recommended for anyone passing through or working in the area!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102078641965155497930/reviews
Drew,4,"It's an OK Cheers, mostly for convenience stuff or some food on the go, but the prices are slightly higher. If you're looking for groceries, there's a Cold Storage nearby, or NTUC over at Vivo. I think more people come here for the Toto / Singapore Pools outlet inside.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101284562920569774106/reviews

Only to be chased away by the staff extremely rudely. i asked them i thought i saw tht they closed at 11, the staff at the cashier just ignored me. the extremely rude one is the lady/booch cashier with short hair. please update your opening hours if you are just going to be closed at your stated opening hours on google",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118366077302712227306/reviews
