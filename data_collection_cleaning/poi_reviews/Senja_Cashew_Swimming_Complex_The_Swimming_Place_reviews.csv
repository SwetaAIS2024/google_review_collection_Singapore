Hui Min,4,"I’ve been swimming here almost every weekend, and the pool is generally clean and clear. I also appreciate that the water isn’t too cold, which is great since I can’t stand the cold. The pool is usually not too crowded as well especially during 3-5pm. Overall, it’s a good pool for doing laps. However, I’m not a fan of the mini pool beside the slides, it tends to be quite dirty.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106664972664686045716/reviews
Quentin Lee,5,"Nice and clean pool facilities. It seems like one of the newer/improved pool complexes around. With the booking system in place, the pool was not crowded, with around 3-4 people using 2 laps.

The kids’ water play area looks fun - like a normal playground but over water. Do note that each kid above 1 year old needs to have an ActiveSG account and they need to have a slot booked together with adults to enter.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112608570649966707783/reviews

DragonSpitfire,1,You can’t bring your board into kids pool. Then u can’t use extra floater into normal pool. The fark you mean? You expect people to have their own condo pool? No wonder there’s less human beings visiting your pool.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117972869133086619631/reviews
