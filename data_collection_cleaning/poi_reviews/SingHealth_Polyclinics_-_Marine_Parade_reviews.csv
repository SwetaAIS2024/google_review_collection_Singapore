Daniel Lim,1,"The service staff really need to improve on their service quality. Did my blood test and the nurse that attended to me was unfriendly and unhelpful. Needed to schedule for an appointment to request for medication, the front counter do not give proper instructions and out of 4 counters, only 1 is in operating. This is suppose to be Marine Parade Polyclinic which everyone looks up to high level of service…really disappointed..:was from Pasir Ris and over there, no complaints. They are all very efficient in all departments.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108931764762705752853/reviews
Cheryl Toh,5,"First time at the polyclinic and found the registration process smooth. Was attended by the counter staff within 10 to 15 min ( who has been excellent with her service) and in about 5 min, get to see the Doctor. Dr Ng gave detailed explanation and guidance on the follow ups. Collection of prescription was fast and the pharmacist gave good advice on taking the medication.  Thank you for the good experience.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103489366630601069837/reviews
Puppy print,1,"The doctors there are nice and polite and detailed in diagnosis. However, the waiting time is ALWAYS VERY long!!

Firstly, we are unable to make appointments via app for same day visits, so we can only walk in. To get a morning slot, we have to be there very early like 8-830am, meaning sick patients can't rest long in the morning.

So today after walking in and registration at about 840am, i got an appointment time for 1 hour later, and my queue status is 8 patients before me, which is still reasonable and i can wait. However, when it reaches my appointment time, my queue status was unchanged and still remained 8!! It's almost 12nn now and I still have yet to see the doctor!!

Why was I given an appointment time at 840am when the actual time is so GROSSLY FAR from 940am?? If i had been informed there are 20+ patients in front of me or if I was given a more accurate appointment at 1130am or 12noon, i would be able to plan my time more efficiently instead of just waiting for 3 hrs while being sick and supposed to be resting. :((

Wasted half a day mc at the Poly just to see the doc, and this is not my first time having to wait so long. :(( I'm not sure if all Polyclinics operate this way, but i hope the system can improve to allow advance booking of appointments on app. For walk-ins, give patients a more accurate appointment time. And not make sick patients wait for 2 - 3 hours at the Polyclinic for nothing!!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101457242426254467606/reviews
Chul hyun,3,"Despite appointment and 1 hour advanced check in, wait is still over 30 mins.
Pharmacy collection is unclear as no one or sign clearly explain about scanning or enter IC at pharmacy kiosk to start the medicine collection…waited another 20 mins without knowing",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106397667933958477677/reviews
