Jovin Eng,4,"Newly opened Zi Char stall at level 1 of Wcega Plaza. Service rendered by the boss and staff is awesome, attentive, and welcoming.
The recommendation of Hor Fan dish by the boss is totally a must try, flavourful, tender and superb wok hey taste!!
The rest of the Zi Char food are also not bad but a little tad salty. Can be improved on this.
Please do try the Hor Fun when you visit there...",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112022100593391268784/reviews
