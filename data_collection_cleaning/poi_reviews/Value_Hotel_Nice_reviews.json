When i rang and asked the lady in the reception about the cleanliness and size of room, she said that she will call me back on room's phone and didn't  bother to call me back. I have to go to reception and talk to the lady, she and other 2 people in reception didn't give proper response.\n\nThe person in the reception was rude and he  said that all the rooms in Singapore will be of similar size and if I want a bigger room, I should go to Malaysia or other country. He also said that THE HOTEL ROOM IS BIGGER THANK HIS HOUSE (at this point I realised that these people have no knowledge and better not to waste my time discussing)\n\n*******AVOID THIS HOTEL*******",

The Malay lady receptionist was incredibly friendly, helpful, and attentive, and her customer service and professionalism deserve a 5-star rating. However, our most recent stay was not as pleasant. Despite informing the receptionist that my husband and i would be checking out at 1pm, the housekeeper came to our door about 5-10 minutes before check-out time and rang the doorbell quite assertively. He reminded us about the time and asked, quite rudely and repeatedly if we would be leaving soon. Despite this incident, I still believe this hotel is worthy of a high recommendation.",
