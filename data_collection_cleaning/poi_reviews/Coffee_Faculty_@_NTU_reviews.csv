Serafin in Singapore,4,"I tried the Rose Latte earlier today. It was quite tasty for me. 4 stars for it. But the counter staff tried to charge me 50 cents more when I asked for it to be more sweet, which I refused to pay. Instead, I took a few sachets of sugar and paid the normal price. It tasted quite good. I'm not paying you a single cent more for a little more syrup.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292514515016892428/reviews
Irina Kartseva,4,"Wouldn’t give 5 to this coffee, beans were a little bit over-roasted. (But I’m pretty picky with coffee)

Overall I was happy that they had student discounts and loyalty card :) Personal is super friendly!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109535053559157627105/reviews
