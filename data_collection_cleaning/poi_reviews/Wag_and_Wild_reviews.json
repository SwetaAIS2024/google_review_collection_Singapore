      "text": "Possibly my dogs' favourite place in Singapore. They go crazy for the pool and you can literally hear them whining in excitement a mile away.\n\nWe love that it's really spacious and even on a crowded slot, there is more than enough space for my dogs.\n\nThe staff, especially Kaine, is very on the ball with keeping the pool safe and clean for the dogs. I usually bring my own toys and have left my toys behind accidentally. Kaine actually kept them safe for me till my next visit! We also really appreciate that he steps in at times to advise owners when their dogs need help with learning how to swim!\n\nAnd yes, we are also huge fans of the friendly boss, Alex! Thanks for having such an awesome space for my dogs!",

No checking status of vaccinations neither. Very under staffed although the person at the entrance tries his best. Doggies had fun anyway",

(The facility provides sockets outside, but not dryers, u gotta bring your own dog blower or like a dyson hairdryer).\n\nKaine however offered to lend his his personal one, which we are very thankful for.",
