      "text": "Update 1/9/2023\nThe coffeeshop has been renovated. I looks modern and clean\nOrdered the prawn omelette today and or is so good. Crispy on the outside but nicely done on the inside with fresh crunchy prawns\n\nWonderful Thai food in a small coffeeshop at Block 69 Bedok South.\nWe had Thai fish cake, mango salad, chicken green curry, pork omelette,  pad Thai and moo ping. Food was delicious and the total cost was only $36.50 for 6 dishes.\n\nDefinitely can eat!",

Fish cake, moo ping, spring roll, pandan chicken, tom yam, omelette, basil chicken, mixed veg, boat noodles, etc. price is reasonable similar to Nakon. However, the owner doesn’t recognize customers and is not friendly. They have recently relocated to a bigger stall after the coffee shop renovated.",

Stallholder was extremely friendly and offered to send noodles to my table.\n\nI asked for less noodles and my bowl came with a lot of green veggies and bean sprouts (I like!). Thai food usually have a lot of MSG but I don’t have an MSG aftertaste unlike Nakhon and Nangfa. It maybe a tad less tasty but it’s definitely healthier. Best ever Thai boat noodles? Not really.\n\nWill I be back again? Yes. To try the non-carbs dishes.",
