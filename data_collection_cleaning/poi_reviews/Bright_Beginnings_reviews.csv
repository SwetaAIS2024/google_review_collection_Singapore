Annie C,5,"Dedicated educators with strong passion to nurture young kids into resilient, kind, and curious learners.

All my 4 kids attended/attending this small cozy learning center, and flourished under the professional care of the very patient teachers of Bright Beginnings.

Teachers would discipline my kids lovingly yet firmly when needed. However, my 4 kids still love them, as my kids can feel that teachers genuinely care for them. Also, the lessons r ALWAYS fun and engaging.

Teachers are responsive, and often give insightful feedback to parents to aid developing each unique kid to their fullness potential.

Couldn't have ask for a better school for my kiddos. Thank you Teacher Su, Teacher Mel and all the other BB teachers for the past 6 years of partnership!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105775433898764426633/reviews
Billie Haywood,5,"Bright Beginnings has been apart of my children life for 6 years. My youngest from 2years of age till now almost 9. The staff feel like family. Effective communication and easy atmosphere has brought many families back, from early learning childcare, to tuition. We have always enjoyed the personal care and guidance from the teachers. Such great memories. Do check out the centre if you like a smaller personal childcare kindergarten.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106423258558544955161/reviews
Justin Tan,5,"Our 4 kids either currently attend or previously attended Bright Beginnings. We are very fortunate to find BB and grateful for the teachers.

Six stars. Highly recommended.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100994269338192746224/reviews
Hoirull A,5,"Bright Beginnings encourages active parental involvement in a good variety of developmental activities and fun programmes. The centre has a very warm family environment and it revolves around a culture of care for the children. They provide regular updates on my son’s progress and the activities that he took part in during the day.

I have seen an exceptional amount of progress in my son’s learning. He was a timid boy in the beginning but his teachers opened up the world for him to learn. His speech improved dramatically, became more creative, confident and has a greater understanding of the world.

It is indeed a bright beginning!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103140934778209550672/reviews
