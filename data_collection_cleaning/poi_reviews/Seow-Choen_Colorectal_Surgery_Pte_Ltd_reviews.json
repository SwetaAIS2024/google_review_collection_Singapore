      "text": "I had a disappointing experience with Dr. Seow Choen. Despite his many years of experience and assuring me that the success rate of my procedure would be 98%, I experienced complications after my pile surgery. When I returned for a follow-up, I was advised to undergo a second surgery to address the issue. Furthermore, upon learning that I was claiming through my company insurance, he proceeded to charge me for the second procedure. This experience has left me extremely dissatisfied, and I would strongly advise anyone considering pile surgery to explore other options.",

He puts us at ease about the procedures. My husband was discharged within 24 hours of surgery. And we returned a week later for review. Highly recommended and a go-to doctor. Don't let the clinic location fool you.\nDr. Seow-Choen YOU ARE GOD SEND. And a big thank you.",
