Arun Paulose,5,"It's a park and an Island. It's big....,  so can get lost ðŸ˜‰! You need to be prepared well for a long walk.  Though there are escalators, who knows you might miss a spot...!  Get a map from the entrance, nd make up your mind on the path you would like to take. There r mono rails nd busses inside which is free. There r lot of activities inside for which additional tickets need to be purchased.  You will need at least 5hrs to cover the island in a rush... More time, the more you enjoy...!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106943416095508570624/reviews
