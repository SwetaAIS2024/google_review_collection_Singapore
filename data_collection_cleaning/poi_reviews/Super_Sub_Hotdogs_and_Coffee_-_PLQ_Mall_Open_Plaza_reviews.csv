MeT,5,Dogs Dogs n more Dogs - all plump n luscious savoury with a variety of toppings or sauces. Great for a quickie snack or even a full meal. Upgrade to a longer dog for just a dollar n definitely value for money for a 12inch dog - yummmy scrunchüòã  Service is speedy n the food fresh n hygienic (so important these days) and eaten el Fresco in the square to get that great outdoor ambience yet under the shade n cover.

Botak,4,"Great place to chill at night, where food and drinks are reasonable priced. Only that because of the fans,  the paper cups and containers for your food can fly and mess up your table or clothes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100060791396189603978/reviews
nocommentyo,4,"Malaysian tastebud sorta approved. Had the heavenly yuzu crab in a set with lemongrass tea & potato salad sides.

Had lil bites of pomegranate in the yuzu crab fillings which caught me by surprise. Interesting!

Hotdog 3.5/5
Lemongrass tea can omit. Sweet. Get other drink.
Potato salad- 3/5

Would love to try other hot dogs and pair it with other sides. Saw a table with some colorful tortilla/vege chips‚Ä¶ Looks good!

Oh ya! Friendly cashier who recommends well!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101456186702023822199/reviews
Elvis YZ,4,Food was good but not really something out of the world. Tried the normal sub with upgrade to 12-inch sausage. The kopi was good. The only downside is that the tables and chair are wet.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107955321389670190178/reviews
