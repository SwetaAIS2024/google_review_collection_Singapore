To me I see the the quantity of the food to it's pricing to be not so worth it as the price does not correlate to the food quality.  A reduction of the food prices by $2 could bring in the crowd.  Yeah I know people still buy from your shop however bringing down the prices of the food will really help out in terms of food sales in quantity as this isn't a high class restaurant.",
