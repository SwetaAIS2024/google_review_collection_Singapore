Last year i remembered the teachers prepared a video of the kids singing/performing a song for the mothers, it was so touching, so I hope the school can do that again. Thank you!",

Kid is always excited to go to school in the morning, which, to me, is the best testament to how great the school is. It’s comforting to know that she feels happy and secure in her learning environment.\n\nWe truly appreciate the dedication of the staff, who take such good care of the children. Their commitment to safety, learning, and overall well-being gives us great peace of mind as parents. A big thank you to the wonderful team for creating such a nurturing and positive space for the little ones!",
