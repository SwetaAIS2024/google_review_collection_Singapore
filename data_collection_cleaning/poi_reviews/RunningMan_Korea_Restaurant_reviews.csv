Marie T,5,"Unbelievable! For RM45 per pax, this was superb value. There were 10 different appetisers and the kimchi was delicious. The amount of meat was generous and we love the marinated chicken. On top of that, there was a full portion of tteokbokki and kimchi stew which were really delicious. I hate chives/spring onions but I love the small chives/spring onion pancakes here. It was light, crispy and so good! Service was good. The staff cooked the first round of meat for us and we did the rest ourselves. The Korean lady boss was also nice and friendly. It was pouring heavily when we settled our bill and she got her staff to take us to the car with a big umbrella. We will come back and try their other food.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114049215531008882460/reviews

Jonathan Soh,5,"Authentic Korean Food! Family friendly. Although only 5 type of side dishes, they are generous to provide add-on and refill. Great service! We feedback stream egg was slightly burnt and taste/smell burnt when eating, they replace a new one without charge. I had kids so they help with grilling of the skewers and they were perfect without any spot of charring. Love the way they serve the Rice Bowl. unlike other restaurant that serve sauces in the rice bowl. they kept it separate so we can mix in the right amount to our taste butt and spice level since I have kids. Awesome dinner and I will be back to try out other dishes!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103059140997508969911/reviews
