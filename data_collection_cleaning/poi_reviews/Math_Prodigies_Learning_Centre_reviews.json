      "text": "I was introduced to Math Prodigies by 2 friends.. one whose boys benefit from the programmes offered by Math Prodigies and another who informed me that Coach Saiful was a former student of her school.\n\nI appreciate that they have adhoc holiday programmes that we can join. That was what we did. I enrolled my son in the June bootcamp after which my son was the one who requested to continue because he enjoys the classes & find the techniques taught suitable for his pace as well as learning.\n\nThe price i paid was totally worth it (there are more expensive programmes i must say!) What we got were access to lessons online, videos of past lessons, hard copies of the revision worksheets. I appreciate that the learning and revising process is topical and they focus on the different parts of answering techniques. Learning materials provided are very systematic & i love the fact that communications between parent and the center is kept open and amicable.\n\nProgramme is catered to different learning abilities. My son enrolled in the higher ability class and he truly looked forward to his lessons every Friday. We were aiming AL1 for Maths in PSLE and although we didnt get the targeted grade, i am honestly still grateful for the bond that was formed between my son and his coaches, namely Coach Vini & Coach Saiful as well as his tuition mates.\n\nStudents were brought to Super Park as part of celebration post PSLE. It was something my son was looking forward to! When i see such arrangements made, i sincerely feel that Maths Prodigies is serious about balance - study hard, play hard too!\n\nOverall, im filled with gratitude To see my son love the subject and hear him say that his lessons in Maths Prodigies are among the best experiences in his primary school life. I strongly believe that a child‚Äôs journey isnt solely about grades (as much as we welcome excellent grades) but the experiences along the way matter too. I hope to continue letting my son be part of Maths Prodigies family in his secondary school journey. Thank you Coach Saiful & Coach Vini for being part of my child‚Äôs learning journey. We are blessed indeed!",

      "text": "I am absolutely thrilled with the progress my son made through Math Prodigy! Under the skillful and dedicated guidance of Coach Saiful and Coach Vini, his performance skyrocketed, jumping by 4 ALs from the end of P5 to the PSLE! This was not just due to mastering skills but also because of the emphasis on applying those skills effectively.\n\nThe learning resources offered by Math Prodigy, both online and in print, are incredibly well-developed. They cover all the essential concepts in depth and make it easier for students to grasp complex ideas. Coach Saiful's practical tips were invaluable, and his sense of humor ensured that lessons were always engaging, never boring, according to our son.\n\nCoach Vini was equally impressive, particularly with her ability to break down difficult concepts in a way that made them understandable. Both coaches were proactive in providing support, responding with clear video explanations through the online helpline whenever my son had questions.\n\nThe reward system also played a crucial role in my son's motivation. The system allowed him to experience success, giving him the confidence to keep pushing forward. This positive reinforcement made him feel a real sense of accomplishment and encouraged him to take ownership of his learning journey. Parents will also receive useful tips!\n\nMost importantly, my son became highly motivated and self-directed in his learning. He developed a genuine interest in mastering math, which was a significant transformation from before. He looked up to his coaches and wanted to do them proud. My son didn't just get tutors but great role models! I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful to the team at Math Prodigy for helping him achieve his best! Passionate Math experts, motivating and generous coaches who truly care. Magical touch indeed.",

While our son was not particularly weak in Maths, we believed that with the right guidance, he could bridge the gap from AL3 to AL1. Thanks to Coach Saiful‚Äôs and Coach Vini's expert coaching and invaluable techniques in tackling the more difficult questions, he achieved exactly that!\n\nWe are truly grateful for the support, encouragement, and strategies that helped our son reach his full potential.

Math Prodigies used various methods to help their students - weekly online homework, Paper 1 revision and teaching of heuristic through Paper 2 questions. Coach Saiful also prepare additional materials and recording which the P6 students can access at anytime for their revision. For Liyana, one specific strategy really helped her in checking of her working and answers. We are really thankful and very appreciative for Coach Saiful and Coach Vini guidance and support which helped Liyana realised her full potential.",
