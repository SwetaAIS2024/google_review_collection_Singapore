Asher Bradley,4,"There is a Koufu cafe nearby and a Prime supermarket. Playground is also quite good, only just a few rusty edges. However, the sculptures are dirty and rough. Walkways are also a bit old-looking. Other than this, it's a good park.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115028335788353902081/reviews

Ice Qu,5,"Perfect place for families to gather and enjoy a morning...or really anytime. The palms and other trees are lush and beautiful.  Plenty of sun or shade plus benches to relax. Near some food/beverage spots. In between housing blocks. Easily reached by bus or MRT.  The sculptures are all wonderfully innocuous, from a whale or fish shape to bocce ball looking blobs to rounded fused cubes and so forth. Nothing that would scare a 3 year old or look spooky in the shadows of an evening stroll. Playground areas here and there. Walkways on varied ground surfaces.  Good neighborhood vibe.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112472682452415767759/reviews
