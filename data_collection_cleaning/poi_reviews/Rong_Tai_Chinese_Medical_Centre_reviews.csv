Raymond Png,5,"I recently injured the sole of my foot while playing badminton, so I went to Rongtai Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic for treatment on the recommendation of my mother. I didn't make a reservation in advance and went directly to the 1st floor. The receptionist told me that the reservations were full for the day, but suggested that I try to go to the 2nd floor to see if there is any space.

I took the elevator to the second floor and was welcomed by Xiaoyu, a very enthusiastic Chinese medicine practitioner. Together with another Chinese medicine practitioner, she carefully examined the soles of my feet and recommended a massage treatment and herbal dressings for the soles of my feet.

Sister Yu's massage is very good! I could feel her strong pressure on my injured area, and then she did fire therapy, which felt very warm and soothing. After 30 minutes of treatment, she applied a thick herbal ointment on me and carefully bandaged the soles of my feet.

I have made an appointment for a follow-up appointment tomorrow and hope to recover as soon as possible before traveling abroad.

Thank you very much for Sister Yuâ€™s professional treatment! Highly recommend Rongtai Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic, a trustworthy traditional Chinese medicine treatment center.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103541634068087285926/reviews
