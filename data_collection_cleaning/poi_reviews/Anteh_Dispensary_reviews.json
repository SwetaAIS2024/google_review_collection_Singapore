Even has free drinks like 100 plus, milo etc for patients. Opening hours are long so not an issue if you are sick. Can just drop by.",

During the midst, a staff with specs climb up the cabinet to take stuff, came to the door to call for a patient, but totally ignored our presenced, didnt even bother to ask if she could help in any ways.\n\nI have to go in to the registration counter to ask how can we register and this indian lady at counter told us to wait outside. And I told her we been waiting for very long and no one is there to register us.\n\nThe service efficiency/sensitivity, initiative, is definitely missing. And no sense of apologetic when I mentioned we been waiting for so long, presence was ignored. Please kindly improve on your customer service, and efficiency.\n\nDoctor attitude was bad and skimp too. Just briefly asked a few questions, asked hw many days MC den say issue painkillers and muscle relaxant, go back eat, can go already.\n\nProbably the last visit. We dont deserve such service.",

      "text": "this clinic is full of surprises  - not your typical super bright and clean environment type of clinics but it makes up by having the heart ware - with very friendly, caring and professional staff members who are attentive and try their best to ensure that you are well taken care. I was here twice for settling LPA for myself and my sister, I did not really see the doctor but from what I experienced from his staff members, I know that the \"fruits cannot be too far away from the parent plant\" . The very well-done staff training reflects how the owner and doctor expects and it indirectly showcases the profession on the part of the owner/ doctor. üòõ One more advantage - the price is very affordable compared to the rest of the clinics listed in the Internet.  I paid 24 dollars for this LPA service, nearly half the price of his other competitors... I rest my case. keep it up for trying to provide affordable health are to the commoners staying in this area.
