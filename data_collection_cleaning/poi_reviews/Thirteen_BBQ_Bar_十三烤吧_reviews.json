      "text": "The $18 辣子鸡is fantastic as per many comments. Only meat, no bones. The portion is not that big. We tried the $33 嘛辣烤鱼. The fish is not seabass but more than river fish, lots of meat, few bones. Added $3.50 of cabbage, but portion is again small. But the mala sauce is super salty. I mean really really salty. I had to drink many glasses of water when we reached home. The atmosphere is excellent, not noisy, easy to talk. Background Chinese pop music is audible.",
