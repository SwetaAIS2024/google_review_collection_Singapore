      "text": "Usually order keto coconut avocado juice. The consistency is not always the same but I still order it anyway purely because I love coconut and avocado shakes. But it‚Äôs challenging to order the detox package because the owner is not helpful nor responsive, unfortunately! It was really difficult to get information from her. And when I pointed this out, she directed me to Grab instead where the package is not offered but instead just the individual juices. Meaning double the price. Too bad!!",

Bought a mango milkshake last week and it tasted so gritty/powdery that I tossed out the drink.\n\nDecided to give it another shot today and got their dragonfruit juice. My friend and I agreed that it reminds us of the taste of grass ü•≤ was pretty terrible, 1.5/5, will never get that again.",

      "text": "Happened on 29/12/24 1230hrs.\nJust simply want to order fruit like papaya or guava. The staff knew I was at the cashier and still continue to do her fruit juice or fruit cutting. I was standing at the cashiet and she don't bother looking at me. When I call her \"Â∞èÂßê‚Äò‚Äô, immediately she look and staring at me with the \"black and not happy face\". It's like she doesn't want to do busines I said I want to pay via paynow. She just point at the self kiosk to me. And I ask her again .. where is the paynow QR. She said use the self kiosk and pay via the machine. She just put down the fruit on the cashier table and continue to do her things while I was figuring out on how to do the payment. She just don't bother. She may be having a bad mood. But I feel she shouldn't put the anger towards customers by showing black face and staring at the customer when customer did not give any difficult situation for her. I am just buying a fruit. Hahahahaha",
