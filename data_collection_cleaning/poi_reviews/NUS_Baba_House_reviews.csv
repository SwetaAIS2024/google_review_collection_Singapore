CK C,3,"This is a beautifully conserved heritage building. All visits are by appointment only. Tours from Tuesdays to Fridays at 10am and on Saturdays at 10am and 2pm. Tickets cost $5-18++. It is a pity that no photography is allowed inside the building. Ironically, the person in charge of welcoming visitors at the door wasnâ€™t welcoming at all. This middle aged man might be the Donald mentioned by past reviewers.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Aileen Organic,3,Need to prebook in advance & ticketed place. No photography allowed indoor so can only take photos of the exterior. Guided 1 hour tour. Very informative on the Peranakan culture.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112206400202127444554/reviews
Donovan Leong,5,"This museum is owned by NUS. We had a docent tour by Audrey who provided interesting accounts of the Peranakan way of life and knowledgeable insights. While no pictures are allowed inside the house, you can take pictures outside.
There is an elevator for those with mobility issues, to access the second floor. There are also some well preserved artifacts in the house and I like how this living museum is also used as a research centre for NUS architecture students.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114823484124057377487/reviews
Rena Wong,5,"Amazing experience. I get to see the history of peranakan culture through a preserved household. The building is three stories high and in each level you'll get to experience what a typical peranakan household is like in the past. It is not a guided tour but there are many staff around to give you more info about the artefacts and other bite size knowledge. Staff were extremely pleasant and knowledgeable, and I got to learn a lot from them too. Not too crowded as there are restrictions on the number of people coming into the house and you'll need to book in advance. Definitely recommend coming. Will take at least an hour to explore the whole house. Very different from your typical museum.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101958763208514131302/reviews
JagungKidd,4,"Had a nice guided tour in the 3-storey museum house. Really appreciate how most items are preserved and elaborated on throughout the tour. There is one elevator inside the building, still have to watch out for a few kerb. Overall it's a very nice experience.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105277181532360487392/reviews
