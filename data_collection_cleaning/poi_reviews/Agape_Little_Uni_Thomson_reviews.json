I feel safe having my daughter in this preschool, we love the teachers and staff as they are trustworthy, nurturing and great in communication as well.\n\nThe preschool has an app for us to monitor the check in/check out time, and there are also updates shared by the teachers as well as term reports. My daughter loves going to school everyday ü©∑ There are also some enrichment programs available at an additional fee, such as Chinese Speech & Drama, Music and Science classes (the programs might vary yearly).",
