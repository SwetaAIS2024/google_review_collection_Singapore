We took the breakfast set and the counter staff was very helpful in telling us which one comes with a toy.\nFrom what I observed, the branch does get a number of takeaway/delivery orders. With around 3 staff only, I do see that they are trying their best compared to their competitor with the Golden Arches just a few minutes walk away.\nNot exactly a fair fight but I could see the staff are definitely doing their best.",

      "text": "Probably my first time in BK in the past decade and sad to say will also probably be my last ever. Service was slow but that wasn’t actually the problem; the food was very sad and disgusting to eat. We spent $20 on 2 set meals but couldn’t even eat half of it because it looked so bad and tasted equally bad that we lost our appetite. The chicken burger patties were pale and tasteless (the picture is supposed to be a juicy mushroom Swiss but you won’t be able to tell), and the fries were cold. Ordered a side of salad for $3 but the cup was only half filled with very basic raw veg. Very very sad about the current state of BK as we used to have fond memories of meals that tasted pretty good when we were younger.",

Some may not use to it, but lucky I din clash with her.\n\nShe told customers need to wait 40mins for food. Lack of manpower 没办法\nBK management to do something to attract & recruit more talent !!",
