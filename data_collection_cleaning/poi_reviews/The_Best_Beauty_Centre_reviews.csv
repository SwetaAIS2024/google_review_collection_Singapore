Yow Chwee Lian,1,"Donâ€™t get scam by them. Especially their road show promo price itâ€™s not genuine, their aim is to make you sign their package which is expensive. $2,000 for an eyebrow embroidery.

And it damn hurts when I close my eyes! Never again!

Poon Fong Chong,1,"Itâ€™s completely different when I buy a package for a live and go there. They keep asking me to sign for the package.
