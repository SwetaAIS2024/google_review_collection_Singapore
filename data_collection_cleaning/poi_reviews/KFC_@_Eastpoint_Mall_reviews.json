      "text": "This store is truly impossible to praise! As everyone knows, Singapore has the world's worst KFC and ketchup. Even a single fried chicken drumstick can be fried until it's both hard and dry! The ketchup has an unpleasant wheat-like taste.\n\nThe fact that this store is still in business is thanks to the locals not being too picky about food. Its signature item is **cheese fries** üçü, which is popular among kids and students. Otherwise, if they only sold dry and unappetizing fried chicken, they would have gone out of business long ago.\n\nI once dined here and noticed an improvement in service, so I thought about leaving a good review. But before I could write it, the service had already reverted to its usual terrible state! They really don‚Äôt give customers any chance to praise them!\n\nI placed my order at the self-service kiosk and then went to the counter to pay in cash. However, the **service lady** was extremely slow‚Äîshe kept taking food down, putting it back, taking it down again, and putting it back, completely ignoring the customers waiting to pay at the counter! I saw my order number showing as \"being prepared,\" so I didn‚Äôt rush her, thinking I could pay when the food was ready. But I kept waiting, and even later order numbers were being served while mine was still not ready.\n\nI asked the service lady why my food wasn‚Äôt ready. She checked the number and said it was still being prepared. Then I waited another **10 minutes**, and it still wasn‚Äôt served. Suddenly, my order number disappeared from the screen! I asked her again, and she said it was because I hadn‚Äôt paid! Excuse me?! I had been standing there the whole time, ready to pay, and she told me my food was still being prepared‚Äîwasting my time and misleading me into waiting!\n\nHonestly, if you don‚Äôt want to eat terrible fried chicken or if you don‚Äôt have time to waste, **there‚Äôs no need to queue at this store**. While waiting in line, a customer in front of me even farted loudly at the people behind her! The world is truly full of bizarre things! No matter how much marketing they do to attract customers, their counter service aunties will ruin everything!\n\nThe dining environment here is extremely noisy. The cleaning staff always drag the chairs so loudly that it reaches a level harmful to hearing health!",
