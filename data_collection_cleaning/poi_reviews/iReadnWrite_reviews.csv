Is Chua,5,"Thank you to the teachers for creating an ever positive learning environment for my son. He started off on quite an uneventful note, but as the months (and terms) passed, I noticed he developed an interest in writing. He loved expressing his quirky ideas, reflective of his child-like world perhaps, through writing stories. IReadnWrite provided that avenue for him to learn, improve and express himself that way.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111286020917560530735/reviews
Gek,5,My child has been going to ireadandwrite for 1 year and I have seen the improvement in his reading and writing. He enjoys going to class and interacting with the teachers and his peers alike. Best of all he has becoming more confident in learning the English language. Thank you teachers! I recommend this place for your child especially if he/she struggles with the language or dreads going to class.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102443028074416661531/reviews

Adeline Sim,5,"Teacher Sook Wai is simply amazing. My son was just not interested in reading, he always said “the end” when he saw me pick up a book!
