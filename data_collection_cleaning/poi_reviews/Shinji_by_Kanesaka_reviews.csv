Daniel Hua,5,"Omakase dining experience at Shinji is always so good! The quality of ingredients used, skills and talents of the chefs to make such exquisite Edo style sushi is out of this world.
Went for the Chef's special omakase on Christmas Day and we really enjoyed the food that was prepared for us by the wonderful chefs.
We were especially impressed by the long spined sea urchin uni from Hokkaido. Extremely buttery, sweet tasting with a nice hint of the sea at the end. Best uni we've ever had.
Specially for Christmas, the restaurant had also prepared a special strawberry and red bean covered by mochi dessert. The strawberry and red bean merged together in a beautiful marriage without any of them overpowering the other. The mochi wrapping everything together was perfectly made and offered a nice texture to the outer layer.
Overall enjoyed our Christmas Day lunch at Shinji very much. Thank you to all chefs and staffs of Shinji for the memorable experience.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111059478761499159795/reviews
