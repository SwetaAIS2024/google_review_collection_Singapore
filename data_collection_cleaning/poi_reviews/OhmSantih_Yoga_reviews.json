One of the best benefits of OhmSantih Yoga is this feature, small class size taught by caring staff like Ms Tammie, who is an amazing Yoga instructor. OhmSantih is a great place for yoga and for individualized attention.I will highly recommend OhmSantih Yoga to anyone who‚Äôs looking to learn and practice yoga.",

Teacher War War is extremely friendly, approachable and always takes time to fully understand my problem areas before recommending a series of yoga poses that can help manage my symptoms. She also focuses on ways I can easily incorporate yoga into my everyday life with photos and simple instructions. I‚Äôve recommended her classes to friends and relatives who also agree that she‚Äôs professional and knowledgeable. Thank you, Teacher War War for the enjoyable yoga sessions!",

The studio is great for students who want to learn and practise yoga with it‚Äôs true essence; great for those who want to feel better in their body and mind (or have an injury / condition). Also highly recommend the prenatal yoga and kids yoga here.",

      "text": "I found Ohmsantih 2 years ago as I was looking for a nearby cozy boutique studio to get away from home and work during COVID. As a newbie, I started with their drop in flow classes and eventually move to Ashtanga Beginner then Ashtanga Intermediate & Advance. In the past 2.5 years, I've seen myself improve significantly, unlocking new poses and still learning about myself on every practice with them. I have to say I fell in love with yoga because of all the teachers I've practice with through my journey here and not to forget - the small class size where you get the attention from the teachers to help you push through your practice each time. Teachers in Ohmsantih are super friendly, humble & knowledgeable! If you're looking for a non-commercial yoga studio, strongly recommending you to try out Ohmsantih!",
