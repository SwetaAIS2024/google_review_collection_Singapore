tricia lee,5,"came here to celebrate a friendâ€™s bday & iâ€™m so glad we did :) thereâ€™s a special offer for a steak during birthday months & the staff were kind enough to give us a free AND delicious brownie!

the chicken tenders + bread were good & deserves the hype on tiktok. the lasagna was done right & cheesy as well. atmosphere was good & the staff were really friendly as well.

apart from the steep price point for their steaks, will definitely consider coming back here next time!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106219755749806403276/reviews
Qiu Hui,5,"Dined here twice and both were happy experiences!
The guy serving us was helpful, friendly while keeping it professional. Regrettably my introvert personality didnâ€™t let me get his name. Iâ€™m sorry ðŸ«£
As for the food! Delicious!!! And pricing were affordable too!! Tho Iâ€™d say the size of the chicken for the Kings 2pc combo was kinda small but yooooooooo I really loved it!!! Although my hubby prefers KFCâ€™s ðŸ¤­ well, to each their own! Iâ€™d order it again during my next visit!! Actually Iâ€™m not sure if I would??? Cos I had the steak and it was delicious too :( and not to mention their a5 wagyu Hamburg, promise it was so good!!! But hor, not really a fan of their aglio olio, I find it rather bland to my liking for aglio olio. If youâ€™re coming for dinner, might wanna make a table reservation in advance!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113903563371118355191/reviews
CT Zue,5,"Good food, great customer service!
Staff was helpful in recommending the good stuff in the menu. Meats were great! But the pastas were okay. Wish there's more variety to pair up the meats with. I love the sauces too!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101214431281085760887/reviews
morpheus horacio,5,"Tomahawk steak was well cooked, medium-rare which was what we asked for! Though i would order the ribeye the next time since they are the same cuts with a big price difference.

Fried chicken was the overall favourite, sauce was good but did not exceed expectations when we realised it was mayo-based and the mayo flavour was quite prominent.

Blooming onion stayed crispy throughout our meal which lasted almost 1.5h which was really satisfying!

Remarked that it was a date and the staff served us a cake on the house, super sweet staff, very good service.

Ordered:
Tomahawk steak solo
2 piece chicken meal but changed the fries to the mozzarella dipper
Blooming onion
Ice water
Coke zero
