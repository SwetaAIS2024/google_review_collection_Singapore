Pj Book,1,Eh what is this school if someone punches you first and you punch back for self defense your in the wrong?and also give so much homework that will pressure your children and if they don't complete the FIVE pieces of homework they get scolding and also so much poop in this school(like there are pieces of poop everywhere in this school) when I was walking I almost stepped on one and there is still a piece that hasn't been cleaned yet for 3 days so therefore I'll give this school 2/5 it's mostly bad but some teachers are nice like (ms ang(王老师)) but if you want my opinion if you should go to this school or no for me it's no,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116125933669554656948/reviews

Hihi,1,"I love the memories but I hate remembering how I cried everyday because of the stress my teacher gave me during my P6 year. It was too much for a 11/12 year old to handle. I cried for hours just because of the amount of homework I was given. I felt very tired during that time, my mental health was drained.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106970980376637883788/reviews
Nur Layla,4,I love it but my ss teacher scolded me just for having a tiktok account at P3. I cried in the classroom throwing my stuff on the floor. I can have a tiktok account because my mother lets me have a tiktok account. Another I dont like is THE KIDS. Some of them bully me for fun. A kid came up to me and showed the middle finger and said “This is your food!” Like what. But I still love the school!:),a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113823739844864545323/reviews
Alex yan,5,"School lead by good leader - Ms Tabitha Wong and steer with right value. She is very motivated leader which has play impacted role as compared to old TWPS. Good and motivated leader make a big impact. MOE should not shuffle her for next decade as it take time to root and if MOE seriously want to have every school a good school. The spirit take time to build, just like kampung spirit, not about the structure but about human interaction which take years to root.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113560838902342314304/reviews
