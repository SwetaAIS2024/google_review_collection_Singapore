Snoop Ee,5,"Had a really nice time here with friends. Ordered the Lamb Shank and Shepherd's Pie, crispy nutty hazel chocolate cake and apple crumple for dessert.

Lamb Shank was so well cooked, with meat so tender and tasty. Served on a bed of finely mashed potatoes. Yumz! Highly recommended.

The Shepherd's pie was ok, a little dry inside but still tasty. Love that both mains came with loads of greens with tangy dressing. So appetising.

The hazel nut chocolate cake was delicious. The crispy biscuit at the base and taste of hazelnut chocolate was well put together. Not overly sweet so I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think I forgot to taste the apple crumble though... ðŸ˜‚

Had a really good time here. Staff was nice and polite, even as they helped us clear our cups at the end.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117540808388622978655/reviews
Ong Zhi Yuan,5,"I stopped by for dessert and was blown away by the flavours. We tried the fudge brownie with salted caramel ice cream, and it was divine. The brownie had a perfect balanceâ€”crunchy on the outside, rich and chocolatey without being overly sweet. Paired with the creamy, subtly flavoured ice cream, it created a delightful contrast that felt truly gourmet.

The restaurant itself is a feast for the eyesâ€”beautifully decorated, airy, and spacious, with plenty of seating. The lively atmosphere adds a sense of community to the dining experience.

The staff were warm and attentive, and the food arrived quickly. This spot is a must-visit if youâ€™re in the area!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104417804420531473764/reviews
Dylan Li,4,"One of the more bougie places in UTown. I've tried the burgers and pasta and wasn't a big fan of the miso burger, but the others were great. The sweet potato fries are solid. They blast the AC, so it gets quite cold inside. Overall, it's a good place for western food in UTown.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227455027475284936/reviews
SeungJun Kim,3,"Visited here the 2nd time, and the quality of their burgers and sweet potato fries have dropped quite badly. I recall earlier this year, their burger patties were soft, and their sweet potato fries were crunchy and tasted very good. But now, their burger patties are tough and chewy, and their sweet potato fries were soft and mushy. I couldn't finish their sweet potato fries cos it was just not that good anymore

As The Royals Bistro is probably one of the most expensive restaurants in NUS, I expect a better standard in the taste of their food",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100958975977925692266/reviews
paulneo,4,"My first time here and Iâ€™m blown away! Thereâ€™re so many highlights in this eatery! Generous portions of food that is hard to find in SG these days. Love the generous amount of side salad for the fish n chips because I love my veggies. I cannot stop eating the laksa pasta! Itâ€™s so good! However, the sweet potato fries are not as good. Iâ€™ve eaten better ones. The ondeh ondeh sliced cake (sponge) is also a tad dry.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102498170516500903894/reviews
