Flavors were still good but the crab itself wasn’t easy to eat because of how overcooked it was. Got the fried squid which was disappointing because it was over crunchy and didn’t have the greatest of flavors. Got some greens which was pretty good. Prob won’t come back here again but also maybe just didn’t order good options.",

The auntie staff kept asking us whether we can add some more dishes as we have limited time for our dinner but actually there are still quite some empty tables around.... While she kept telling us we had only half an hour for our dinner at 8:30pm !!!\nSounds like someone in the long queue waiting outside. After we settled the bill, there was actually no one outside.... Bad experience.",

She went above and beyond in suggesting dishes, checking in on us throughout our meal to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. I’ve never felt so welcomed in a restaurant before; if I could give more than five stars for her service, I certainly would.\n\nThe food was incredible, and I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Singapore who wants to experience authentic Singaporean cuisine.",

      "text": "Brought my family of eight, who were visiting from abroad, to New Ubin Seafood for lunch, and we had a fantastic experience.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious. We tried their Instagram-famous Heart Attack Fried Rice with Angus beef—the meat was incredibly tender and succulent. The Hokkien noodles had an amazing wok hei, while the Boss Beehoon reminded us of San Lou Beehoon. The kailan was cooked just right—crunchy but not chewy. The pork jowl paired wonderfully with the sauce, the har cheong kai was crispy and well-marinated, and the salted egg crab was packed with flavor. Every dish was cooked to our preference (no garlic, non-spicy), which we truly appreciated.\n\nA special shoutout to Bara, who took our order—he was knowledgeable, customer-centric, and accommodating, making us feel right at home. Our assigned server, Himanshu, was also attentive and polite, adding to the great service.\n\nIt was an amazing dining experience that left us with wonderful memories. We'll definitely be back!",
