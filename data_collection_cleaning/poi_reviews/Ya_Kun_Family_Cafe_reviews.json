      "text": "Had been patronising them since day 1 they opened at JP. Service is not consistent at this branch, depending on who the cashier was, who the drink maker was on that day. Today, the cashier seemed lost and needed to keep on repeating my order as if she was not listening and unsure. The service overall was on most occasions NOT friendly, no smiles but only black faces. I ever encountered very lousy customer service from the kopi auntie who assumed the drink I ordered, added more hot water into my kopi C when I requested for more evaporated milk due to the bitterness. She even showed bad attitude and argued with me when I asked for more milk instead of water. That staff needed training very badly! Today, the ikan bilis and crackers served in the nasi lemak were chewy and not crispy. The staff should maintain their freshness in airtight containers. Prawn thick bee hoon was kinda tasteless though the prawns were pretty fresh. The kaya toast were not well toasted, looked unappetising and not crispy too. Can the HQ take a good look and find out what is going on with your HQ branch's standards???",

Is it reali work that way? They also never check for order and just gave me my incomplete order after i waited, i told them my order is nt complete then one of the aunty sounds very unfriendly like i did sth wrong? Such unprofessional service and unsystematic management",
