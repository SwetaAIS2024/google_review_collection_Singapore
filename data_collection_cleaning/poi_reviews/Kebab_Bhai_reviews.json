Plus, the prices were really reasonable.\n\nIâ€™m especially grateful to them for being able to accommodate my order with such short notice, as I only placed it the day before.\n\nHighly recommend!",

      "text": "Was pretty good! The portion was generous although a tad pricey, similar to stuffd!\n\nHad the chicken with butter rice salad bowl, and I was really full! Struggled to finish, probably could share with another person or try the salad itself.\n\nChicken was not as shiok as stuffd, but does give the more original feel. The bbq sauce and hot sauce were great combo! Spicy sauce not as spicy as the habanero sauce so all good for those who just want a bit of spice.\n\nRecommend to try! The shop is located beside Nam Kee Pau, previously tenanted by Shilin snack bar.",
