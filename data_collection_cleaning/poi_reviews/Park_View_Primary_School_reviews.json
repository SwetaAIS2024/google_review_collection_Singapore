      "text": "Bad students. When there was a crowd and we were going to leave the school, there was a green collared pri1-3 himdu boy was fiddling with the keychains on my backpack. When I looked back, he was frowning at me like i did something. When i was walking back, i had noticed that the keychain ring was loose. My bag zip was open and multiple items were missing. What concerns me is that the students around him and me didnt even tell him to stop or anything. Students are also very noisy outside of school and many will disturb you. I dont recommend. Im glad im graduating next year.",
