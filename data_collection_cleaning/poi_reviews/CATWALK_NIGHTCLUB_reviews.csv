Peter Chan,1,"Don’t go there! Last month, I went there with my friend (2 pax).

We reached at 8 PM, and they didn’t tell us they had no girls. Once the beer tower was in front of us, they then told us that most girls were not here yet and that we would have to wait. They only had a few, and they were not up to standard.

My friend ordered one girl, and we waited until 9 PM, but still no girls came. We billed and decided to go to Leos. We paid for the beer tower and food, which was around $180, and my friend settled the tip of $100 for the girl.

After the girl left, the manager, Aloy, immediately blocked the door and requested a tip. He demanded $170. In the end, my friend settled with him at $150, and we went to another place happy.

This is the first time I have written a one-star review in my life, and even after a month, I still feel unhappy. I also run a business in SG and understand the importance of reputation. However, it’s wrong to block the door and demand a so-called papasan tip when we only sat there for around 40 minutes, without much service, and were unhappy when we left.

We go to night spots to enjoy ourselves, not to be forced to pay a tip when there is no service at all. The worst part was the manager and two waiters blocking the door and refusing to let us go.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111165040909538195932/reviews
