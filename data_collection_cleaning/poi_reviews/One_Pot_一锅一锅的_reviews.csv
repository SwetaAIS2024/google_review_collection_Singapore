Colin,4,"Very tasty. Chicken pot on its own is good value for 26.9 for half a chicken. Sides are a bit expensive.
Sauce is thick and full of flavour.

$6 for the fried egg, but tastes great in the sauce.
Sides range from 2.50 to 5.50.

Most people should be able to take medium spicy.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112477726864016792635/reviews
Ong Zhi Yuan,5,"I dropped by One Pot to try their signature chicken hotpot after hearing about the option to add an egg layer on top—it definitely lived up to the hype.

I ordered the chicken hotpot with the egg layer. If you’re dining solo, the pot is slightly smaller and cheaper, but you can still add the egg layer. The meal comes with either rice or, for an extra 50 cents, maggi noodles.

The chicken was served in generous, boneless chunks that were tender and soaked up the flavorful hotpot sauce beautifully. The egg layer was a pleasant surprise—it absorbed the sauce perfectly, adding an umami twist that paired so well with the chicken.

The staff were super friendly and offered helpful food recommendations. Plus, there was plenty of seating when I visited during dinner, making the experience smooth and enjoyable.

If you’re in the area, this is definitely worth checking out. 9/10!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104417804420531473764/reviews
tan adam,5,"I've tried Chicken Pot numerous times in Singapore, but this restaurant's version stands out with its distinct flavor profile.

The addition of fried egg elevates the dish remarkably! I also highly recommend their Herbal Chicken Hotpot - a delicious and healthier option. 5-star rating, highly recommended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109188017494978942959/reviews
Randomstuffsg,5,"As a repeated customer, I can confidently say this signature chicken pot in Ang Mo Kio never disappoints! The addition of their new fried egg into the pot is a game-changer, blending perfectly with the fragrant, umami-packed chicken pot. The flavors are rich and satisfying, making every bite a delight.

It's best enjoyed with a side of instant noodles or a bowl of rice, especially on a cold, rainy day—comfort food at its finest! The hearty broth and tender chicken pieces keep me coming back for more.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116551745132589748453/reviews
Ruel De Guzman,5,"We thoroughly enjoyed the piping hot chicken, which was expertly seasoned with a delicate blend of herbs, adding a refreshing aroma to each bite. The accompanying side dishes were diverse and thoughtfully prepared, enhancing the overall dining experience.

For an extra touch of indulgence, we topped our meal with a perfectly fried egg, which added a rich, savory flavor that complemented the main dish beautifully.

The restaurant is open Tuesday through Sunday from 5 PM to 10 PM, making it a great choice for an evening out. Highly recommended for anyone looking to savor a memorable meal.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845368500527509689/reviews
