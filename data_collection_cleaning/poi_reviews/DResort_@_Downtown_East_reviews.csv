"Chan Wai, 陈柃汐",5,"Celebrated my daughter birthday at D’resort. Finding the hotel lobby is difficult if you arrive the resort via public transport. It is a long walk from downtown east and there is no clear signage on how you can get to the main lobby. It’s very inconvenient and the shortest path require you to cut through the carpark. What make it worse is you might need to walk another long path to the room if you room happened to be at thr furthest area from the lobby (park view rooms).
The room is very spacious, the bed is comfortable. There is a fridge where you can store all the bbq food and drinks, so this is really good for us as we are having bbq. The bbq pit is just right outside the room, so it’s very convenient for us to run between the bbq and the room.
The room and bathroom is new and well maintained. The only downside for the stay is that there is only ONE chair in the room. I think they should have at least a few so that people can sit and chit chat.

Ramon Merola,3,They have a lot of facilities for families which is great and close to the airport. Major let down is the shower runs off an I instant system and runs out of hot water within a few short minutes. Also no fresh bottled water is supplied. It’s not 4 star it 3 at best,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111540360155945423574/reviews
Jack Wong,3,"An average place for some fine gathering for family/friends. Overall experience has been positive but somewhat the lacking of an amusement park like they have many years ago is a pity. If you love the sun, this is a good place for you to chill out.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118108570946860899987/reviews
Muhammad Eeqmal Hassim,5,"The room was spacious and clean, with easy access to the large bbq pit area. A great spot for family gatherings especially if you book adjoining rooms.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113126515504060051953/reviews
Rusty Gale,5,Good shuttle bus service to MRT .  Shame it’s not from lobby. Friendly reception team . Rooms are good .  Cooking facilities / fridge but only cups in room no utensils  . Nearby park and cycle rental very good.  Slides were closed onTuesday so did not use this .  Shopping centre and closeness to eateries / supermarkets and shuttle is a mature help to the experience . Good for airport stopovers,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793869522730334627/reviews
