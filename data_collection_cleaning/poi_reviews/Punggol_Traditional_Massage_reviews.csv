Elsa Syafiqah,5,"I had the pleasure of experiencing a 10-day postnatal massage, and it was truly a great experience from start to finish. She was incredibly patient and took the time to understand my specific needs, ensuring she focused on relieving pain points and tension from childbirth. She also provided invaluable tips for both me and my baby.

Overall, I am so grateful for her expertise and care. I feel so much better after these 10 days, both in body and mind. If you're a new mom looking for someone who is professional, knowledgeable, and compassionate, this postnatal massage is a must-try!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101991319997798949360/reviews

Mardhiah Noorshahid,5,"I was having a bad migraine episode 3 months into my pregnancy and was sceptical at first but I badly needed someone to massage me. Googled and found Julie online so decided to try my luck. It was fantastic! She knows which areas to massage even without me telling her. Since I’ve yet to get any postnatal masseuse, I decided to get her instead and I did not regret it one bit. Am planning to still continue engaging her as and when I needed a massage.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108362255721397316932/reviews
