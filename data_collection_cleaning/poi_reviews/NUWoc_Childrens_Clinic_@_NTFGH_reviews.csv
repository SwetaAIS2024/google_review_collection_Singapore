May Chua,2,Super long waiting time despite not many people. Would not recommend here if you needed attention right away. Reception staff was very nice and patient though,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102538899725781538194/reviews

Evgeniya Pod,1,"Needed to see doctor cause our kid suddenly had very bad coughing on Friday afternoon

Tried to make appointment on the app but takes 2 or 3 days to process. Had to walk in cause number was taking forever to reach them.

Walked in at the clinic and they didn’t give us a number straightaway as they needed to check with the doctor. Eventually was chased away to another clinic with the reason “I checked with my doctor, one has a meeting and the other one is quite packed, the waiting time is 2hours. Would you like to go to UCC at Bukit Panjang?”

I asked if they knew if the queue was shorter there and they told me they didn’t know. I called and check and the waiting time there was also 2 hours.

So basically they chased us away to another clinic that is equally long.

Didn’t expect such service by a public hospital.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100305618155619736172/reviews
