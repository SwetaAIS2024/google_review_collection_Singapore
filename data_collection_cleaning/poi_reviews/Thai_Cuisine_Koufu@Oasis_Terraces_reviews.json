Average pricing was about $7.\n\nWe each got our own mains and shared a tom yam soup. Everything tasted decent for its price point and however, the tom yam soup tastes slightly different (in a good way) to the usual ones. It has a slow burn effect, i.e you feel the warmth in your tummyüå∂Ô∏è\n\nHighly recommend if you‚Äôre around the area!",
