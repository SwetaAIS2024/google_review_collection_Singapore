Most of the shirt distance and low cost airlines operate from here, kind of hub for Air Asia in Singapore.\n\nTerminal attractions also look good, but only disadvantage is ita bit isolated from main terminals T1, T2 and T3.\n\nYet good connectivity from these terminals to T4. Free shuttle available, but frequency is bit less. Rest all look great.\n\nInternational food court have all kinds of restaurants and dining options",
