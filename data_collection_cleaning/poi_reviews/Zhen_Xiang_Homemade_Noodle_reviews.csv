Jason Lee,4,"My top pick is the Pork Liver Mee Sua, where the pork liver is cooked to perfection - tender, juicy, and not overcooked. I also appreciate their variety of noodle options, including Mee Hoon Kuey and Ban Mee. The Mee Hoon Kuey stands out for being handmade, giving it a delightfully chewy texture that surpasses those found in food courts.""",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117371894884760957562/reviews
Leon T,4,"A small stall tucked in a coffee shop at the ground floor of a HDB block. It offers usual noodle fare like ban mian, mee hoon kuey, u mian and dumpling noodles. It also offers dumplings and guo tie (pan fried dumplings) too.

The noodles were ok, the lady will add an egg for you for 50 cents more. I ordered a dumplings noodle to try and found the dumplings were more on the vege side (aka more chives). Not sure if you can ask can change to other versions of dumpling (or if available in the first place)

I‚Äôll still come back to try other dishes since it‚Äôs pretty affordable and good service too.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112055732544846425678/reviews
