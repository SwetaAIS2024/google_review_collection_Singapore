      "text": "It's a place u have to really find if one is specially looking for Indian food.\nHead to terminal 3 departure area. Go to level 3 using an escalator just over the security area. Then take another escalator to level 4, viewing mall area.\nThe area is not clearly defined in Google maps and if direction is taken it will lead you to someplace else.\nGetting vegetarian Food out of India is tough and at the airport it's especially hard since only a few outlets are there. Bikanerwala is a good and only second best option in T3. It offers all the food menu that's given in India.\nThough it's on expensive side, one time eating can be easily had. The taxes are extra so be careful when getting the food. It will become expensive as surcharge and gst is charged above menu prices.\nSince it's located out of the way you can easily get seating and food service without waiting so much.",

I also wanted the papdi chat without curd & they helped me with that too..\n\nChole bhature, Pav Bhaji, papdi chaat, Raj kachori is a big hit for me\nEach bite was a burst of flavors and texture üòã\n\nLip smacking food amazing vibes & taste.\nDon‚Äôt forget to try their ras malai & soda sikhanji to make it a perfect end to your meal.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Bikanervala for its lip-smacking food and wonderful vibes. It‚Äôs home away from home!üè†",

      "text": "We had a wonderful dining experience at Bikanervala Restaurant in Changi Airport, Terminal 3. Located on Level 4 in August last year. it‚Äôs a bit tucked away, so it might not be the easiest to spot, but we found it thanks to the information terminal‚Äîand we‚Äôre so glad we did!\n\nLooking for a quick vegetarian dinner before heading to our hotel, we were delighted by the peaceful and calm atmosphere of the restaurant, which was a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of the airport. We ordered naan with paneer curry, and both were absolutely delicious‚Äîflavorful and satisfying. The service was efficient and courteous, adding to the overall pleasant experience.\n\nWe‚Äôve bookmarked this place for future visits, and it‚Äôs definitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre in the area and looking for a calm spot with great vegetarian options. Highly recommended!",
