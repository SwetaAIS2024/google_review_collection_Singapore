dvnhzq,5,"very easy-going and straight forward instructors. won't rush you for cooldowns after completing your run, damn near bus interchange and can drive in and park at in-camp multi storey carpark. any NSmen not staying in the west just come here legit, only downside is no smoking corner for smokers post-ippt. this place is actually heaven after being in smelly Gedong for 2 years. üëçüèΩ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103693277494424310786/reviews
Loki,5,"Came here to take my annual IPPT. I must say I really applaud the FTs for their work ethic and professionalism, explaining the entire process in detail, with a very easy to follow structured flow from in-pro, briefing, warmup, static stations to the 2.4km run and finally cool down and outpro. Whole process took no more than 1.5hours.

FTs may seem strict but are very nice and approachable. Special mention to this female instructor Eugena who was very patient and helpful, giving us tips and encouragement while we did our static stations. Can tell that she loves her job and genuinely wants everyone to do well. The small actions she does really makes a difference and made my IPPT experience much more pleasant.

Those coming to take their IPPT, remember to bring your water bottle. Somehow SAF makes us do water parades between every activity. And try to book the 6pm slot so that when you start your 2.4km run it‚Äôs not so hot.

All the best!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101937176024039442948/reviews
