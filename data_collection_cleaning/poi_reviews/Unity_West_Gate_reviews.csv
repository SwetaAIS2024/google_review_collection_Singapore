risha Kaur,1,"I was at store today. Purchased a blood pressure machine. At the cashier, another customer behind me approached me to help add on her item on my card so that customer can pass her cash to counter. I was just being helpful by saying sure. However the attitude of the cashier Karen Yeo really shocked me, the full recipes with bonus she hide it (waiting for me to leave so she can pass all of it to the other customer) I continued to stand there & she had no choice but to pass me. She also told the other customer, it’s ok I will pass you more later. I’m not sure if this is some kind of internal scam going on or staff is just racist. I really hope the management will look at the cctv & review this case. I would want a formal explanation on this experience I have faced today.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105823251472138201606/reviews
