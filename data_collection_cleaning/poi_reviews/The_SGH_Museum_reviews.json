While the display of the tools is interesting, unfortunately, there is a lack of information about how these tools are used. The museum would greatly benefit from providing more context and explanations to enhance the visitor's understanding. Overall, it is a small museum that could be improved with better interpretation and educational materials.",

The meticulous curation unveiled a captivating journey through the historical instruments, offering profound insights into the early days of SGH. The exhibits not only showcased the evolution of medical tools but also painted a vivid picture of the hospital's humble beginnings. It was a journey that left me with a deep appreciation for the medical advancements and the dedicated individuals who shaped SGH's legacy. Do not miss it! #SGH #museum #SG #",
