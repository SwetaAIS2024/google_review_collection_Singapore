Qin Zhengquan,5,"Very old school bakery that opened since 1958 (according to uncle). This is the real deal. There aren't many of these traditional bakeries left in Singapore. Wide selection of pastries at very reasonable prices.

Interior preserved in its orginal state. Stepping in made me feel I was back in the 60s. Pay this a visit when you can!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116832318449768232431/reviews
