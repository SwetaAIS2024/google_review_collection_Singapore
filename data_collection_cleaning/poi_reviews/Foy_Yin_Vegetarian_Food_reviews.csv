Yun Xiang,4,"Breakfast: $3 for vegetarian noodle set.
Went at 630am weekday. Noodles are bland. Fried goose is not as crispy. Other ingredients are decent. Portion is also decent. Green chilli and chilli is not self service. Need to be requested.
Overall very average.

Dinner: $4 for duck rice and $1.50 for soup.
Duck mock meat is braised. The chilli is nice. Rice has hint of herbal taste. The soup has generous ingredients such as corn, fungus tofu, carrot etc. soup taste good.

Dinner:$4 for hokkien mee. The taste is Abit bland, taste more like ""seafood beehoon"". More bee Hoon than yellow noodle. Ingredients are generous.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100471045446290739173/reviews

Kevin,5,"My first visit to this stall. Ordered the beehoon for only $3. I really really love it! It's hard to find this taste nowadays! It's nostalgic! Plus the crispy beancurd skin is the traditional kind (not those machine cut rectangular shaped ones), which makes it even more delicious üòÅ
Will come and try the PM menu too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108741234092402570352/reviews
