Flo Yeow,4,"It's a very typical coffeeshop tse char. Nothing too fancy, nothing to scream and shout about. That said, amongst all neighboring tse char stalls, this is probably one of the more popular ones. Straightforward menu and items.

Queues do move, and the lady at the counter taking orders is quite friendly.

We got ourselves some Sambal Kang Kong, Malay Mee Goreng, Hor Fun, and Shrimp Paste Chicken. Good meal for the family.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
