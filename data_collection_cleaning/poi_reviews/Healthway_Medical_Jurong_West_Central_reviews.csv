Today from. 4pm the phone is engaged.  I have to call to bukit batik to enquiere re-open operation time.  Does not make sense.  Today consultation the Chinese ursher nurse raise his voice on me for asking what is my purpose of visit.  I told him I need medication, he asked me if I need to see a doctor.  He told me scan & wait for him in his rude manner when I told him I need to register.  Kindly advocate this disgraceful personnel on his proffesionalism, manner and communication skill.  He potrays the reputation of Healthway.  He is right now watching his movie on handphone loudly and we are in a clinic.  This disgraceful personnel need major advocation on his manners, communication skill and proffesionalism.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103246971304952430845/reviews
