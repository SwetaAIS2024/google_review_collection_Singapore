      "text": "It was a first for us to travel to Masjid Al-Huda and we were in awe at its simplicity.\n\nTo also add, this mosque is part of a trail and is marked as a trail of Kampung Life. We were amazed at how pretty and simple it looked and agreed that this would be the cleaner version of any Mosque in a Village. The layout of toilets, ablution area, entryway, the door placements and more, looked similar to those village mosques in rural areas, in other parts of the world.\n\nWe were glad we stopped by and had one of the daily prayers here. Ok, let's go slightly in detail on the mosque itself.\n\nLocation:\nOne of the inner roads, so parking is very limited. It is located along side with the bungalows and terraces that shield it away from tall housing units.\n\nAmenities:\nClean and very well maintained. So whoever is working on the mosque has done a very very excellent job. Fans make the place more cooling. There are also tentage set up, probably to accommodate the increased patronage. Not much public amenities but works sufficiently for a trail.\n\nHistory:\nMosque construction started from 1925 and the current year is 2024. So it is almost 100 years old! Imagine the background story the mosque has, from the transition from villages, to wars, to SG's independence and more.. this mosque has seen it all.\n\nWe definitely would mark this mosque and drop by if we are near the area, for it's serenity and calm feel that we got from praying here. Check out our images..\n\nCheers!!",

Al-huda is located in the Bukit timah area and is one of the oldest masjid of Singapore. Al-huda was built in 1966. At present the only limitation is it’s poor connectivity to public transport as the area is quite residential.",

It maybe a matter of time, anger may erupt from the other drivers.",
