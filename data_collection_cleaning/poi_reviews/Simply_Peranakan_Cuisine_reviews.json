      "text": "Simply peranakan cuisine offers an exceptional dining experience with truly authentic food. From the moment we arrive, the warm place made us feel like home. The interior beautifully reflects the rich heritage of peranakan culture, creating a cozy atmosphere.\n\nThe food is a true highlight, with dishes like ayam buah keluak, standing out for their deep flavors and perfect balance of spices. The beef rendang was incredibly tender. To top of it all, the desserts were the perfect sweet ending. We had an amazing time savoring the delicious food while soaking in the peranakan ambiance. The service making the experience even more memorable.\n\nassam fish head curry: very tender and delicate. The taste of the curry soup just topnotch! Not too strong, which is i like it very much\n\nsambal Kang Kong: very smoky taste and garlicky, once you eat, you will never stop eating that kangkung.\n\nBeef rendang : the meat very tender, and you can feel the coconut and the rich of ingredient just there.
