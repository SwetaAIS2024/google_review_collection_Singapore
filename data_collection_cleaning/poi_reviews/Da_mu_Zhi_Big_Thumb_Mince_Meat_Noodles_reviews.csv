LULU EVOX,4,"Fuuyooo. Pork liver my fav!! The colour can tell this liver is cook perfect. The portion is rather small for my size, but it’s $4 only. Can ask for much.. they topping with small grain size fry garlic to enhance the flavour, to me is a plus point.. Generous bits of pork lard.. nices…Soup is tasty too. 👍🏻👍🏻 Another hearty meal nearby my home . Will come back again..",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107012020161541736403/reviews
