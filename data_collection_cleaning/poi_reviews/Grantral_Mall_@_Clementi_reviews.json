Some low priced Chinese restaurants, a Chinese supermarket, some tuition centres, some beauty salons, and an Anytime Fitness gym.\n\nTo me it's the shops here, that draws the kind of crowds here, which makes the whole ambience feel messy and unexplainably stale.\n\nEven though it's right by Clementi Mall, if I have no business here, I don't think I'll want to come and hang out here. There's no reason to, anyways.",

Dr. Sim  adjusted my dosage from 5mg every other night to 5mg every night. Even in his letter to the polyclinic the dosage mentioned was still 5mg. Can you please clarify this discrepancy? I would appreciate a detailed explanation. Thank you.\"",
