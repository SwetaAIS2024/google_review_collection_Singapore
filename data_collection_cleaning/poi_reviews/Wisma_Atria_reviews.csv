sam Mariella,3,"BEAUTIFUL FOOD COURT

This is a rather small mall along the Orchard. Linked toward Orchard MRT and Takashimaya through underpass. The young  hype and crowd is along the pass. ISETAN is the anchor here.

I like the Foods Republic food court. Beautiful interior and good selection of food choices.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107208136672624210336/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,"Wisma Atria has been going strong since I was a child decades ago, glad to know it remains relevant and popular. Lots of retail and shopping available, with OCBC bank and a food court. Love how connected it is to public transportation especially Orchard MRT station, at the heart of Orchard Road. Will be back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Oliver Pe,3,"Small mall with a good food court.

A few interesting features:

Layout is pretty small with limited shops.  Foodcourt high mainly local cuisine.  A parking lot is at the top two floors which is not usual.  The OCBC branch which also has an English bookstore and gift store.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108482139427055811566/reviews
subwoofer,4,super clean toilets with many surface areas and mirrors. the vanity station is such a nice touch! however they don’t provide paper towels. hand dryer are by the sink makes so much sense. the lighting also is not glaring. 4/5 would take a poop here,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114149888416906096920/reviews
E,4,"Wisma Atria's a great mall on Orchard Road, you know, the fancy shopping street in Singapore.  It's got a cool glass front and you can walk right into it from the MRT station – super convenient!

Shopping there's easy:  It's got five floors, tons of stores – over 100! – with a mix of local and international brands.  You'll find familiar names like Charles & Keith and Isetan, but it's not as fancy as ION or Paragon, so it's less crowded and more relaxed.

Food's awesome too!  There's a huge food court on the fourth floor, plus some really nice sit-down restaurants and cafes.

It's easy to get around, and being connected to the MRT is a huge plus.  It's quieter than other malls, which is nice.

Overall, it might not be the fanciest, but it's a really good place to shop and eat, and it's not too hectic.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103665268796109855493/reviews
