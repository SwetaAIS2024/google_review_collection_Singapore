usman shaikh,5,"Not very massive and big but such a unique mosque perhaps the one specific in Singapore.
A must visit place for all Muslim visitors who go to Singapore.
You can say that it is mix of modern and orthodox Islamic values blended in modest way.
Proximity is easy n accessible, main downtown, very near walking distance from famous Ion mall.
If you would wish to see an established prayer place in the middle of Manhattan, NY, it's the simulation in Singapore.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112757541418460251428/reviews
Abu Faris,4,Nice masjid in the middle of orchard road Singapore. Very clean toilets and ablution facilities. Huge ceiling fans render coolness in the main prayer hall. Pleasant retreat to recharge and pray  after a hot and humid afternoon walking in downtown Singapore,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104578838964811390031/reviews
