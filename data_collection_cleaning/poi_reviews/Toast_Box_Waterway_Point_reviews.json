      "text": "Our family always enjoyed toastbox for their food and service, but this morning, one of their staff completely ruined our good mood with her impatient and rude attitude. I believe her name is called 碧芬. First, she impatiently hurried me to scan my credit card while I was getting ready my phone, then when I asked her to scan my Yuu points, she refused and told me that I should have told her before I order. Utter nonsense!!\n\nI dont usually write negative review and i dont think its fair to judge toastbox based on one staff’s poor attitude, but I hope the management can be more aware of such staff to not affect their good reputation and ruin other customer’s experience.",

However, the one who prepares the toast is so ignorant, I ordered Kaya toast bread with very little butter, but she purposely prepared it with full butter and she still denied it. I told her to show me and her face turned black. With the amount of butter that she puts, does she intentionally want to make people unhealthy? Perhaps HPB can take action on it.",
