jess x,5,"Lovely little gallery with beautiful and interesting art. Stumbled upon this place while wandering around and had the most wonderful time chatting to the director of the gallery about tea, history and art - wouldâ€™ve stayed for longer if not for an appointment. Very much worth a visit!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117965691185146432333/reviews
Timothy Chacko,5,"Beautiful gallery. I got the chance to talk to the people operating this place and found it so lovely! They explained to me the artists behind the work, the beautiful zisha pots, and the old tree puer they had on display. Would love to see more from them :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104229736759710835004/reviews
