M Mmm,4,"Went on Friday night, we are the 3rd group of customer waiting in line. There are table needed to be clean and empty seats available but waitress have no more bandwidth to bring customers in. waited for a good 15 mins and finally got in. Place is noisy, lots of echo. Need to raise voice to heard each other. The atmosphere and service wasn’t really pleasing. Roasted chicken was oos at 7 plus, didn’t managed to try and gotten the white chicken. It was good, the sauce is nice. Rice is fragrant and tasty. Traditional dumpling, a good mix of mushroom, prawn and pork. The beansprout was served piping hot and tasty delicious. Not a fan of their chili and ginger sauce but it was okay cause the food already taste good.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110088043357308799235/reviews
Julius Tan,5,"Best roasted chicken rice in Singapore hands down. Had their chicken rice for many years and the main branch is the best, their roasted chicken has crispy skin with flavourful meat. I had their roasted chicken at their now defunct Marina Square outlet and it wasn’t very good. I usually eat at their restaurant to ensure the chicken is at its tastiest. You can skip their tze char dishes and stick to just chicken rice because most of them are underwhelming. I have eaten their baby sotong, Thai style beancurd, dough fritters and sambal kangkong and all of them were below average.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113038098593710664705/reviews
A B C Traveller,5,"The best chicken rice in Singapore, ranked by chicken rice lovers. This is the main branch. If you do not arrive early, you may need to queue up. The boiled chicken and roasted chicken is the best. The sauces are superb. We enjoyed the meal so much. Highly recommended for tourists.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116585614877993483182/reviews
michael lin,4,"Ordered a roast chicken and a white chicken for Dabao with our own containers. Both with skin. Prefer the roasted one. Though the white was good too, just not the very best we’ve had. Chicken served cold, as it should. Veges served piping hot and were comparatively expensive. I asked for less oily, but still seemed oily, and was slightly over salted. But have to have a balanced meal right?!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101093200154303210000/reviews
Daniel,4,"Overall it’s not bad, I just found it a little bit pricy compared to similar places nearby. Would still recommend this place. We paid $31 for 2 combo sets.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110468385476911513294/reviews
