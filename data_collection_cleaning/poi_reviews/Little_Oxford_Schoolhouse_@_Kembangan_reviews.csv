Anjali Singh,5,"I highly recommend Little Oxford @kembanghan for its exceptional education and nurturing environment. The friendly and dedicated staff go the extra mile to ensure each child feels supported and cared for. Regular updates kept me well-informed, and the school's inclusive celebration of festivals fosters a harmonious community. Thanks to the dedicated teachers, my child has made remarkable progress in academics and acquired valuable life skills.

Thank you to all the teachers and support staff for being a part of my child‚Äôs learning journey.:)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104690703419112745500/reviews
Santiago Jiaxi Zhang,5,"My boy (2.5y old) joined the N1 class at Little Oxford Kembangan school from Jan to Apr 2022 (withdraw due to personal reasons). We rate the quality of Little Oxford 100/100. It was my son‚Äôs first school experience and he super enjoyed it. The teachers and the school principal were so nice and professional. My son was well taken care of and he learned a bunch of skills from the school that really surprised us. I can see my son‚Äôs development and progress every single day and sometimes he doesn‚Äôt even want to leave the school when we go pick him up in the evening. Overall, I fully recommend Little Oxford.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113536004604815804212/reviews
Anusha Dasari,5,"This play school is an amazing place!Very clean with great staff and very welcoming.
Management here is really committed providing a safe,fun, and loving environment. Amazing staff with so much heart and caring mindset. Teachers really make an effort to engage kids and develop them in very individualised way.
The facility is well thought of room seperated to keep ages apart and structured so that teachers are able to help each other out.
Teacher Sha is such a loving and understanding person. All teachers are awsome.
I can see the growth and learning every day .
Please keep on the great job that you ladies do... üëç
