They were very dry and I could taste that they were close to expired or even perhaps, already past their expiry dates.\n\nThe expiry date stickers on the boxes were deliberately torn off (I could still see a small bit of the sticker left on one of the Butter Cream Cake boxes), which I think is dishonest.\n\nPlease take extra care when purchasing from this store, especially if through a food delivery platform.",

She went beyond her call of duty and followed through to ensure that order was delivered on time. I was very touched when she messaged me to check whether the goodies were delivered. I found her hard working and passionate in her work. Thanks so much Miss Christine. You will make a good manager!",
