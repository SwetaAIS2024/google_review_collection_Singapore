edtayjb,5,"I bought today a chicken curry puff and a you tiao from this place, nestled in the quiet environs of Potong Pasir. Both were very good.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107467079327459015215/reviews
YY,5,"Truly is one of the best and unassuming curry puffs!

üí∞ got 2 for $3, as my wife and I bought this as a post lunch snack to eat on the way home.

The crust is super well layered and crispy, fillings were generous, and it was very warm still when we got it at around 1pm in the noon!

Manned by an old couple at those shops along the HDB block, I‚Äôm hoping the sales is enough for them to sustain a living and I will be back for more in future üëçüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
Sharon,5,"Consistent in flavour and texture over the years.
Filling is deliciously moist and nicely spiced.
Pastry is invitingly flakey and not oily.

The owners are accommodating and friendly. Their meticulous handmade puffs here are my personal preference over all the other bigger and famous brand names in Singapore, for both quality and value.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110413594339774113337/reviews
MNG,5,"Superb curry puff! The dough was  almost crispy rather than crusty. Beautiful folds and perfect even after air-fried.
The sardine version was flavoursome with onions added and a touch of spiciness.
I would love a slice of egg to complete the experience, together with a cuppa. But for $1.30, nothing to complain.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
L Tan,5,"Got the chicken curry puffs. So good.
Hard boiled egg was perfectly cooked, with the perfect level of mild spiciness and crispy crust.
Reheated a piece in the toaster the next day and tasted just as good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107239748810633917671/reviews
