Ani Nor,5,"I recently ordered a takeaway pizza from Hougang Green Pizza Hut, and overall, it was a satisfying experience. The ordering process was smooth and the estimated wait time was accurate. The staff were polite and efficient when I picked up my order, which was ready on time and still piping hot.

The pizza itself was delicious. The crust was perfectly baked—crispy on the outside yet soft and airy inside. The toppings were fresh and generously spread, and the cheese had that perfect gooey stretch. I especially appreciated the balance of flavors; the sauce had a nice tang, and the seasoning was just right.

One small downside was that the packaging could have been better. Some condensation built up inside the box, making a few slices slightly soggy. However, this didn’t take away too much from the overall taste and quality.

For the price, the portion size was fair, and the value for money was great. I would definitely order from here again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty and reliable pizza takeaway.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106221069877857236675/reviews

Aqmal Jasman,5,"I ordered from this store and had a great experience! This outlet is for takeaway and delivery only, so no dine-in. Ordered in-store, and the staff was friendly and efficient. My food was prepared quickly and packed well. The pizza was hot, fresh, and super tasty—crispy crust, cheesy, and loaded with toppings. A great place to grab a quick meal on the go or order for delivery. Will definitely be back!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106726916042324419322/reviews
