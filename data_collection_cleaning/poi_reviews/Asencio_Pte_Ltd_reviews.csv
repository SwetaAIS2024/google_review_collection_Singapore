acuppakopi,5,"Smooth purchasing experience. Staff were quick and helpful. I drop by to try on the uniforms for my girls, and it was better as compared to getting it online.

Getting there may not be as easy by public. There was also no signage as to how to go to the shop. We figured out somehow. Need to find the passenger lift which was allllll the way in but the shop was right at the exit of the lift at level 5. :)",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107328144598391394146/reviews

serene,1,"Horrible website still can indicate ""easy to use guide"" worst of all they don't even answer calls! If can rate 0 star I would have done so. Why set up online purchase when you have such a rubbish website. Please don't waste our time trying to purchase it online because its either getting locked or unable to find the item you need.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108617185422436483030/reviews
KK,1,"Visited on first Sat after school term started.

OBSERVATIONS:
- staff busy & frustrated,
- customers waiting & frustrated.

ISSUES:
- queues not clear,
- staff spent time going around to write orders & give out orders

SUGGESTIONS:
- extend opening hrs (compensate staff with time-off),
- queue labels at counter & at entrance,
- re-organise queues (1 for fitting, 1 for order/exchange placement),
- different sizes of worn-out uniforms in fitting rooms,
- give out order/exchange serial numbers to customers for staff to call out when order/exchange is ready for pickup & payment.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117389463959063348446/reviews
pang chengkeong,1,"I placed an online order at this bookstore over two weeks ago, I have received nothing. No tracking information, no updates—absolutely nothing. It’s as if my order fell into a black hole.

I tried reaching out to the contact information listed on their website multiple times, on different days and at different times, but they never responded. Their so-called ""customer service"" is nonexistent.
This has been a frustrating and disappointing experience. I do not recommend this shop to anyone. Avoid at all costs!

And finally after about 20days. I received. and then found out. 7 file missing.....",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100762964604578143778/reviews
