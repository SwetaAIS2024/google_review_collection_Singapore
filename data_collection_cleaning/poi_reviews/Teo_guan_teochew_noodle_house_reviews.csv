Leon T,4,"Visited this stall while in the vicinity. Ordered a lor mee for my dinner. Service was fast and it seems quite popular with the residents nearby.

The lor mee was not bad. There’s quite a lot of ingredients in it for $4 such as fried fish cake (the kind sold at yong tau foo stalls), strips of pork belly, half a braised egg and a thin cutlet. I’d say it’s a nice comfort food on a cold day.

The stall offers fish porridge / soup with rice and other noodle dishes like laksa, BCM etc. at pretty affordable prices too. Do pop in to try if you are in Bangkit.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112055732544846425678/reviews
