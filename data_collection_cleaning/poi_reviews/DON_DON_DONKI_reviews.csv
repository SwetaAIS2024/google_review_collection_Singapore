Pauline Yoong,4,The donki store in 100am occupies two floors. Like other stores they sell ready to eat hot and cold food. You can just buy and go to the eating corner to enjoy the food. They even have a microwave to warm the food up. Will be good if they can provide some napkins. The food was hit and miss. The fried stuff turn soggy after being displayed for a long time. Sushi was ok.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109959124710224590577/reviews
Flo G,2,"Utterly disappointed that DD Donki has gone downhills.

Used to be a choice outlet to get chilled Jap beef and pork for hotpots.

Today‚Äôs experience leaves little desire to be back.

Choices:- Not as great variety compared to previous times. most are premium range.

Check out:
First off, lines are long.
Staff directs most to self check outs where coupons, dmiles redemption are not accepted.
Back to long Q and when ask for dry ice for meat, it‚Äôs chargeable at 10cents each.
No more free.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews

Tot2travel WP,4,"Updated photos in 5/25 :

""Every burger"" confectionery is cheaper if buy in twos. Same for some other products. The bundle pricing may not be displayed for this outlet.

Occupying 2 floors with less crowd on weekdays morning. More food variety spotted.

With self check out counters, plastic bags are no longer sold instore, thus BYOB or pay for an eco bag.

Exchange/ Refund (within 30 days except for non-perishable, undergarments, etc) can only be done at your original place of purchase.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109058897885515300830/reviews
