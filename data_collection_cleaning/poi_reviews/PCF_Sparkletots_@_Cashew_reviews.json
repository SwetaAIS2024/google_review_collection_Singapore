      "text": "This is probably one of the best Sparkletots school in Singapore. They have a professional team of educators who will care for and provide regular updates on your childrenâ€™s well beings. The principal Ms Janice is hands-on, caring and approachable. This school at Hillion also has a spacious compound for the children to roam, explore and learn in various rooms. E.g. culinary, cinematic, water play. In terms of quality and convenience, there is no other school in Bukit panjang as comprehensive as this. I would recommend it.",
