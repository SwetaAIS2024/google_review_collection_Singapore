eynaa nurelynn,5,"MFS PR4 has a great team of teachers who are always friendly and always maintain close relationships with both parents and children. My kids enjoys going to school. The school has recently went through refurbishment. Its location is ideal especially with the upcoming Pasir Ris East Mrt which is abt 2 mins away! On top of that it is located just beside White Sands Primary School, convenient for school drop offs especially for parents who have a few children.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104582067700196737807/reviews

Azri Ali,5,"Both of my daughters were enrolled in My First School(MFS) at Blk 197 Pasir Ris St 12. Previously, due to no vacancy, my daughters had to be enrolled in other childcare centre. Transitioning into MFS at Blk 197 Pasir Ris St 12, it was easy as all the teachers are friendly and each has a unique way with the kids. Even the principal played a huge role in making the centre an enjoyable and memorable experience for both children and parents. The bond between children and teachers never stop even though the child has graduated from their class. Kudos to all staff of MFS at Blk 197 Pasir Ris St 12.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113890934816428650304/reviews
