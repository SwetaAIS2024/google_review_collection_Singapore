My first visit was actually when they were still located near Ayer Rajah market, and I made sporadic visits over the years.\n\nIt seemed as though they refreshed their menu recently, and we wanted something different for dinner, hence the visit.\n\nFood was generally okay. My only gripe was the extremely long menu which resulted in decision paralysis. It would be good if they could put together a set meal or tasting menu that would showcase the must eats and make it easier for customers who are new to Indian Cuisine.",

Chefs and staff work tirelessly, and rarely close on any holiday, so chances are you can come here any day!\nFood here is top notch and I‚Äôve never complained in the many years I have come. I‚Äôve always advocated for the butter chicken, dal and especially the naan here.\nPlace will be busier in the evening, make sure you come a bit early to miss that. A lot of people I have seen online complain about service when the place does not have too much staff. But I‚Äôve never had these issues, apart from big parties or birthdays being held there once or twice.",
