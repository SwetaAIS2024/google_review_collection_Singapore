      "text": "Killiney what happen to you? Plastic plate, bowls n cutleries for eating in? Thats ok. Worse was the quality and taste of the food. I ordered curry chicken with rice. I had such fond memories of eating it near Middle Rd in my twenties. Firstly, chicken was hard n stale, not fresh and so bland, like it was boiled and dunked right in before serving. 2ndly, the curry had no salt, taste-wise was yucks with a very raw chicken taste in it. Revolting! $9.30 for unsatisfactory lunch. Ate the potatoes n left the chicken, it was yucky! Please dont lose your standard left by your forerunners and cut corners like this. Thats hows business run aground!",

      "text": "A SOLID 5 STARS. PLEASE READ TO THE END.LOOK AT THE PHOTOS TOO! The owners were very friendly and nice. I had breakfast here with my mom and brother. Their Laksa and Ham and cheese sandwiches are to die for. Not only that, when I went to purchase a big pork pau, one of the owners gave me not only one big pork pau, but also a char siu pau! He said we can share among the three of us. My heart is melting as I write this. Their service is super good too, quick and easy. From my mother, she also praises the teh o peng that she ordered. I strongly recommend you patronising their stall!! There truly are amazing people here ðŸ’ž",

The coffee I ordered while sweet (and didnâ€™t taste sour like some reviews mentioned) did not taste like the typical Killiney coffee we grew to love. This corner eatery is still a nice place to stop by for a break, and the sandwiches displayed did look delicious.",
