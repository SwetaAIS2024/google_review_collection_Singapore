Place is very clean and airy and is not so packed even during lunch time.\n\nHighly recommended to come early as well as they have breakfast options.\n\nUpdate: went again a few times and has never disappointed us. I brought my friends and family to enjoy their food and live music. If you want a solid malay food experience, this is the place.",

Very clear the owner took out the tali using his bare hands. The owner rasa that is okay untuk ada  tali in my food. Sorry not sorry. You guys need to go for food hygiene class. Very very disappointed with the food & the owner. Maybe here just a place for orang office area situ lepak lepak.",
