Tian Min Teong,5,"Nice mechanics and shop. Prices are reasonable and the mechs at this shop are not pushy nor sales focus type. Paynow is available for convinence. Has been going there for the past 1 year and has changed tyres set, brake pads, battery, monthly basic oil change/servicing. This shop has been around for very long time judging from the signboard and hopefully longer.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107978823756746825453/reviews

Lee Bruce,5,"Called them and was ask to bring the bike down for a check instead of asking it through phone call, boss and mechanics were professional in diagnostic the problem. Workshop was pack and I understand why the boss insist on bringing the bike down instead of answering call.
