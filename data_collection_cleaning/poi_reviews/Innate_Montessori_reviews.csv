Rashmi Agrawal,5,"Teachers are very patient, good, hardworking and maintained disciplined. They are very focused on the each child need.
Teaching methods are so effective to build a strong foundation of a kid.
Apart from this, it is the best place to build good character of a child which is visible in a 2-3 months only in his behavior. This is highly recommended school.

A S,5,"Our son has only been at Innate Montessori for 3 months, but we have seen a marked difference in his behaviour and focus. When I came to view the school, I was blown away by the method and how well-behaved and concentrated the children were in their own work.

As a very active child, the school has tempered his exuberance with a sense of structure to still express himself yet conduct himself in a calm manner. He has always been a confident child, but he seems to be thriving at the school. The teachers are lovely and encouraging, and there is always an open communication regarding our son and his development.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117295918285401584667/reviews
