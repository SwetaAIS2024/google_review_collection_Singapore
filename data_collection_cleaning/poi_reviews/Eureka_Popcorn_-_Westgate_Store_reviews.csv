Saandeep Sreeharshan,4,"Eureka Popcorn is a true game-changer in the world of gourmet snacks. With an extensive range of meticulously crafted flavors, it’s clear that every kernel is designed to deliver a sensory experience that tantalizes the taste buds. Each bite is a perfect balance of bold and subtle notes, showcasing the brand’s expertise in blending flavors that are both unique and satisfying.

While the price in Singapore may be considered a bit steep, those in Malaysia, however can indulge in the same exquisite flavors at a more accessible price.

In short, Eureka Popcorn offers a premium, flavorful journey that’s well worth exploring. A must-try for those who appreciate the art of popcorn and crave a snack that’s as sophisticated as it is delicious.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115818683776774623192/reviews
Joker Ang,4,"Left one star out coz of the pricing.. well it's understandable but I rather go to Malaysia to get it.
Overall it's good depending what flavour you willing to go to.. Service staff on that day is good , pretty much know what you going to say or ask.. taste sample first before you pick..
