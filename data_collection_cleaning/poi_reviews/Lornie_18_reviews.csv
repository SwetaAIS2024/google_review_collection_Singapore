Vin Cui,1,"Current Managing Agent of this MCST 3425, Chambers Property Management Services Pte Ltd, is doing a very poor job of managing Lornie 18 Properties.

Will keep this review here until something is finally done.

So anyone doing your research can expect the following ongoing issues existing for years that are not fixed:
- no 24/7 security guard.
- security gate spoilt for long extended period of time and yet still not fixed.
- unauthorized personels and unauthorized cars parking freely in private estate.
- no weekly basement carpark cleaning, so pest control is a huge problem.
- landscape poorly managed with trees dying and falling anytime.
- Ponds still using old filter systems, so water is practically stagnant and filled with lots of green algae.
- Pipes are not regularly maintained, so this is the reason why every house cannot maintain a water feature. If you decide to use turn on the pipes, there is a high chance of pipe bursting.
- ceiling of basement carpark cracking and with lots of holes forming. Rain water seaping through all the time.
- NEA, SCDF officers have been here a few times already.

The above issues are facts that can be seen with your own eye on how poorly maintained all these common areas are, and Managing Agent can still lie, saying they are keeping high standards all these years. Just think for yourself, why money spent yearly from owners' monthly maintenance paid but still remained in such poor state.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113988704209151287951/reviews
