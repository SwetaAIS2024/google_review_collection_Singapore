Joshua Wong,2,"If you are the franchise manager please go check on your outlet. The soup base is rancid. Bought a pork gingko nut soup and couldn't stomach it. Changed for a lesser value soup (water cress) and refused the refund. Still rancid.

Threw it away after eating 2pcs of pork. Ate just plain pumpkin rice which was ok.

Service is good. Not complaining abt staff. But check your soup. The rancid pork smell is too strong. Eaten at other outlets before not like this.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108676446117164244954/reviews
"Heng Choon Yiak, Davidson",1,"Suggest stall soup to try before start selling the soup daily or every 3 hours.
The soup tasted very smelly, 10/7 evening which bought for dinner.
