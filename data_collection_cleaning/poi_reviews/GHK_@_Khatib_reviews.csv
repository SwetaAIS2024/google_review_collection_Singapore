Trotting Horse,4,Wanted a not so usual dinner and found this ngoh hiang stall. Not too bad considering this is not easily available nowadays. Just that the sauce doesn’t give it much kick.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114960726223703734828/reviews
JP Bautista,5,"Superb Teh and Kopi here. Though it's made by their machine, it guarantees consistency on the mixture--which is always rich and of the right sweetness.

Just wish they can have a way to manage it better or get the orders faster via online or qr code ordering. But then again, it's an old school coffeeshop so understandable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106132181362602172465/reviews
