Caesar Teh,5,"As a proud Malaysian with high prawn noodle standards, I was genuinely surprised to find my favourite bowl right here in Singapore — at the legendary Blanco Prawn Noodles. The broth is deep, rich, and full of umami, the prawns are succulent, and every spoonful feels like a warm hug on a rainy day. Truly a standout among all the prawn noodles I’ve tried!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117206743861643640775/reviews
Jowe Chu,3,"Ordered the jumbo prawn kway teoh soup, pork ribs prawn noodle and the ngoh hiang for breakfast. The servings were generous. Noodles and soup are nice with lots of vegetables, BUT the jumbo prawns were hard and over cooked. Disappointed coz I drove all the way from the west after the 2025 general elections to dine at jalan Kayu.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103686986101125387388/reviews
Michael Yap,5,"The prawn noodles is good and flavourful, a balance taste of good broth. The shrimp was alright. The staff is friendly and service was quick too.  A decent place for a warm and hearty breakfast.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103600919097928744192/reviews
Lisa T,5,Ordered two bowls of jumbo prawn noodles and take away two bowls. They separate the soup and noodles without you asking and you can pack chilli powder and cut chillis. Broth is not as thick as the beach road branch. But it’s still worth eating if Jalan kayu is nearer to your house. Price is higher compared to beach road.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101998729191684176802/reviews
Jerry Tang,4,"I've been here on numerous occasions when I am on my way back from the East. While their soup base is pretty flavourful, it is still not ""gao"" enough for me. I am more for the Loyang Way Prawn Mee type. Nonetheless, it is still a good eat, just not good enough to attract me to visit specifically just for this like Loyang Way one did. Service was good and prompt.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115888625563267924954/reviews
