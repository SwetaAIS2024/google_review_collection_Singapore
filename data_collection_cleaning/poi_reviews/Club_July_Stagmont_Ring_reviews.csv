Apple Teo,3,"Ambience is cozy but food is not to my preference. For stingray lovers who crave for spicy, you might enjoy it! Perhaps may try other food next timeâ€¦",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112556381798305815723/reviews
Blue Angel,3,One of the rare outdoor dining area left. Very limited parking lots so got to be early if you drive. Have a choice of indoor or outdoor dining. I ordered the beef hor fan with gravy and was tasty. Also tried their chicken chop with mushroom sauce and baked beans. Overall very decent food offering and some alcohol choices.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107945861603703795761/reviews
Shelia Lim,5,"Easily one of the best chicken chop we ever had. Pets-friendly, staff were super friendly and helpful (even taking the initiative to offer my dog water), and the food was consistently good (it was so good so we went back thrice).",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105468027631786544818/reviews
