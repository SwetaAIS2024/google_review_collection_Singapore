      "text": "Went here twice because is near my house, they got free pup cup for doggies!! Not sure if you have to buy in order to get the pup cup or not, but surely it will be nice if you have bought their drinks or food.\n\nLets dive in to the drinks\n\nIce french vanilla latte 4.7/5\nIs sweet yet worth the sweetest, coffee is creamy abit, milky and abit of vanilla coffee kinda taste. All blend well together. I would say is really good.\n\nBench signature iced cafe latte 4.85/5\nCoffee fragrant is good, sweetness adjustment is great too. When drink it, is quite smooth to me.\n\nMatcha\nFor Matcha wise, i think is pretty milky and come with the matcha taste, but it feels like the matcha powder is abit thicker than other place. I not gonna rate it as it will unfair that I am not really a Matcha fan. P.s this matcha is not bad, but i have tried better one for me before. (My opinion, so you all can try)\n\nFood\nDouble cheese cros is pretty crispy and the cheese is just right for the the cros.\nChoco banana cros is also great combo.\n\nService\nI would like to really praise their server attitude, they are so nice and kind. Very understanding and can feel their passion in it. Sometimes will explain on how they use the ingredient and stuff. 10/10. Please raise their pay!! Hahahah",

      "text": "Cafe is situated by the reservoir. We have visited the cafe on a weekend evening.\n\nThere was a barista and a lady sitting in the cafe, who I thought was likely a customer. Given that the interior of the cafe seemed small and there was a lady, we have decided to wait for our drinks outside of the cafe.\n\nThere was a wooden table with two portable small fans. Nice gesture because it gets really humid outside.\n\nI was seated only less than 10 minutes,  I was bitten by mosquitoes and had 8 itchy bites.\n\nIt was that itchy that I have decided to push the door and wait inside instead.\n\nTo my surprise, the cafe entrance's door was locked. I was confused and the lady said, \"Oh, I wonder who locked it\"\n\nTo me, it sounded like it was an excuse.\n\nWhen I sounded out to them about the mosquitoes, they were not surprised and sadly, they showed no concern. Oh well ~\n\nAnyway, to sum it all, the drinks were better than expected. I like it.",

      "text": "This is a cute hole-in-the-wall HDB cafe near Bedok Reservoir, with nice chill and cosy vibes!\n\nI went bougie with their Iced Hojicha Latte with Gelato (S$8.80), with oat milk (S$1.10). I liked the drink as the hojicha flavour was strong and prominent (the drink wasn‚Äôt too milky), and the drink also wasn‚Äôt too sweet. The sweetness came from the ice cream after it melted, and the ice cream was nice as well - made with Madagascar vanilla beans, it was pretty rich (definitely not like a standard Magnolia ice cream). I only wish there were a bigger scoop of the gelato!\n\nMy friend got their Bench Signature Iced Cafe Latte (S$6.20) which is actually a pecan praline coffee latte, she found it pretty interesting and tasty with the pecan flavour coming through (I tried it but it wasn‚Äôt as distinct for me, maybe because I didn‚Äôt drink much of it üòÜ)\n\nWe enjoyed their drinks - they have other interesting flavours as well, such as Matcha/Hojicha Affogato, Coconut Matcha Breeze, Matcha x Hojicha, Mixed Berries Cooler and more! The only thing is that the cafe is slightly small so it can get pretty crowded and noisy (it was pretty crowded when we were there, despite the incessant rain and despite it being a weekday afternoon), but I think Bench Barista‚Äôs charm comes from being a small hole-in-the-wall cafe!\n\nFor more food reviews, check out my IG @foodlesstravelled!",

      "text": "Great location! It's amid the tranquility and lush greenery of Bedok Reservoir. Although it is a hole-in-the-wall, their array of speciality coffee, artisan matcha beverages and pastries is not unbeaten. Love the Mixed Berries Cooler which helped to combat the heat! And their signature iced cafe latte is simply smooth and comforting. Will be back to try other drinks!",
