Peter Goh,5,"I can't praise Star Learners enough! My child has absolutely thrived since starting in PG class and continuing all the way to N2. The principal(Mrs Diana), teachers and aunties are incredibly warm, caring, and genuinely invested in my child's development. I've been so impressed with their patience and the creative ways they engage the children. My child comes home excited to tell me about the day's activities, especially the singing and reading they do! It's wonderful to see how they nurture my child's love for books and music.  I've also seen a real growth in his language and storytelling skills. It's clear that Star Learners provides a nurturing and stimulating environment, and I have complete peace of mind knowing my child is in such good hands.  Seeing his progress from PG to N2 has been truly remarkable. I highly recommend this childcare center to any parent looking for a place where their child will be loved, nurtured, and given the best possible start.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117928650525268747924/reviews

Peong,5,"As a dad, I couldn’t be happier with this preschool! From day one, my child has been welcomed with warmth and enthusiasm. The teachers are incredibly patient, caring, and truly understand how to make learning fun. I love how they incorporate hands-on activities, movement, and storytelling to keep the kids engaged. It’s amazing to see my little one come home excited to share what they’ve learned—whether it’s a new song, an art project, or even emotions they’ve explored through stories. The school also does a great job of connecting learning to real-world experiences, which I really appreciate. Seeing my child grow in confidence, make friends, and develop a love for learning makes me so grateful for this preschool. Highly recommend it to any parent looking for a nurturing and enriching environment!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108692218323730597444/reviews
