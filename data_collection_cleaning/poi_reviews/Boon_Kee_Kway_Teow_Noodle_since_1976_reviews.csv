S Kheong,3,"Above average Fish Ball Noodles. I had the $4 bowl.

Noodles - Nice bite
Fishballs - Not bad

Chilli mix is an unusual darkish brown in colour. Taste wise still ok.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112908559587282643563/reviews

Patrick Poh,4,Rustic coffeeshop nested amongst a landed enclave. Old school style fishball noodles. Note:  They added ketchup for the spicy version. Serving is quite huge too for the 4 dollars version.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107673184510491093624/reviews
DataDriven Foodie,4,"Very nice bak chor Mee hidden in a private estate area .

Soup was very savoury with pork essence and the sauce was savoury. The noodles was a tad bit overcooked and this didn't came with liver or sliced pork meat.

Portion came at $4 so it was still quite okay for this quality.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101052801776476610063/reviews
Di Di,5,"It warms the cockles of my heart to eat a hot bowl of laksa filled with thick coconut gravy and cockles on a morning. The stall uncle is nice and efficient. They now pass you a buzzer while you sit to wait for your food. There is no spring onions, I added them on my own to lie to myself that I had my greens for the day. The dry minced meat noodles taste good too and I always ask for additional chilli.

The teh in the same coffee stall has a rich aromatic tea leaves flavour. It was not diluted. The taste of the condensed milk was not overwhelming and it was also not too sweet. They sell kaya butter toast with half boiled eggs too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
