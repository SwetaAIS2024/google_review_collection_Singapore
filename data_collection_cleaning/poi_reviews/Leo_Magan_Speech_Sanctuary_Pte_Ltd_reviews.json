Teacher Megan can engage with her well, and she is looking forward to attending the lessons every time. Thank you Teacher Magan & Mr Leo and friendly teachers!",

I like how she tailors her advice to Singaporeans’ speech habits, which is different from what you usually see online. I’m an adult client and she has convinced me it’s never too late or difficult to improve.",

I once switched to another speech therapy centre due to transportation issues, but the teachers there couldn’t compare to teacher Magan, so I decided to bring my child back.\nTeacher Magan is truly experienced and friendly, providing a detailed explanation every week about the lesson content and areas where my child can improve. My child is always eager to come to class each week and leaves happy every time.",

      "text": "My son is diagnosed to be an individual with Autism. He is relatively high functioning but lacks the ability on how he should communicate and articulate his thoughts. I enrolled him to Leo Magan Speech for almost 3 yrs.  Kai has progressed well, he is more confident in his verbal communication with  his friends, coursemates, lecturers and presentations in polytechnic.  Magan has been patient and dedicated to guide and coach kai to be succint in his communication and sentencing.  Kai also gained more awareness of social awareness  and communication etiquette on how he should phrased his answers, speech and verbal presentation. Overall I am very satisfied with their services and support to Kai.",
