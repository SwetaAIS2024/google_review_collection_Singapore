kpop with lauren,5,"Excellent service at Lens Hub. Kellie, the optometrist, did a thorough and detailed check on my eye health to diagnose issues and then advised on an action plan for treatment. She was also clear and reassuring in her explanations. Another staff then helped in the selection of frames to enhance my facial features.
Excellent experience overall. Will be back and will bring my family to Lens Hub for our optical needs.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106651893124430389451/reviews
Mei Yu Hong,5,"Had a surprising good experience here in making a new pair of glasses. I wished more optical shops are like this, with a genuine attitude and patience. I also saw the staff helping an elderly woman with getting a new pair of glasses and offering them at a pocket friendly price. Way to go!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112162543532259292997/reviews

QINGQING LIU,1,"I've been a customer at this store for many years, even after moving. However, since the arrival of new staff, the service has plummeted. Particularly, this female employee is quick to blame others when issues arise, which is ironic considering she handles all the communication when I call.

Communication with her is an uphill battle. Initially, she made a mistake with the color of my contact lenses, and she attributed it to a previous employee or system errors.

After enduring three price hikes within a year, I expressed my dissatisfaction, stating that I'd rather purchase from a store just across the street. Suddenly, she claimed she'd speak to the boss, and the price would be reduced. However, when I showed her a screenshot of the same item at the previous price two months later, she informed me of yet another increase, insisting she needs to consult the boss again.

Dealing with her has become tiresome, and as a long-time customer, I've decided to switch eyeglass stores. The level of service and communication has reached an all-time low.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105536367543967474332/reviews
