It's run by two experienced owners who has been in the F&B industry for over 2 decades. Always innovating new or revamping existing dishes.\nThier mutton keema pizza is signature item. The commando is highly addictive. Food was so good we forgot to take pictures. Check it out folks.",

I ordered the mutton pizza recommended by the boss, which is full of spices.\n\nThen a regular French fries.\nThe boss is very nice. I asked him to get the ice cubes.\nHe gave me a small bucket of ice cubes. According to Singapore, a glass of water would not be provided for free.\nI thought it would be charged, but it turned out that there was no place.\nIt surprised me!\nIn this way, a meal by the seaside is 47sgd, and there is no service fee or tax.\nIt is excellent.",

We had the lamb kheema pizza, lamb chops and commando fries. The mojito is a perfect accompaniment to wash down the fiery spicy flavours. The service is attentive and friendly.\nWill definitely return for moreüòã",
