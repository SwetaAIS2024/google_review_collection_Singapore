Anne Lau,5,"Dr Loi is probably one of the best doctors we know. Very patient, humble, very into details pre and post op, very very passionate and professional. My mom flew to JB from Sarawak and went through a TKR with Dr Loi, she said it was the best decision she has made. The fact that he is already so successful yet still travels non-stop to learn from different professionals, we really appreciate to have met him.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104617899808659440891/reviews
