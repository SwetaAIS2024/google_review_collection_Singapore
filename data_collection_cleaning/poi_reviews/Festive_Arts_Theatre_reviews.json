Box office opens 30 mins before each show, and tickets are sold on the day. Decent sound, comfy seats with cup holders, clean venue, and discounts for seniors and students - what more could you ask for?",

Saw people bringing in food like KFC and encik tan as well. Went on a Thursday night and it was not crowded. Definitely would go again",
