CARROT PEK,4,"Had company D&D here. Can't choosy much as it was a restaurant Chinese set dinner. Standard taste. 1st cold & hot platter dishes, the crispy chicken, and mushroom fish maw chicken soup taste good. Overall, nice scenery at level 3. üçúü•¢üòã",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117264347329628725540/reviews
ÈòøÂÆù,3,"Attended a relative‚Äôs wedding at this place on a weekday night.

They were doing some work at the carpark so finding a slot was challenging but if not, they have quite a lot of parking lots.

Food wise, is nice but no surprise, just standard dishes similar to other restaurants.

Their service staff there are quite many elderly but they did their job well.

Decoration & set up need some revamp work ü§ì",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
Sugar Cane,4,"Went there for wedding lunch on Sat. Food was tasty in general, roast chicken was crispy, steam fish was nice. Salted egg prawns were de-shelled and the salted egg sauce was not strong enough.  Ceiling lights above my table seemed faulty as they shut off a few times for no reason, leading to false anticipation of the entrance of the wedding couple. My plate was replaced with clean ones 3 times for a 10 course meal.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102145075212317084728/reviews

GERALDINE PONCE,3,"We had 8 course CNY dinner here:

1. Lo Hei
2. Fish Maw Soup
3. Crispy Fried Chicken
4. Steamed Fish
5. Brocolli with Scallop
6. Fried Prawn with Salted Egg
7. Fried Rice in Lotus Leaf
8. Mango Sago

The food that i liked are the fish maw soup and brocolli with scallop.

Fried chicken was too salty, and the fried prawn with salted egg is bland - I can't really taste the salted egg.

Excellent customer service. Staff is attentive to guests' needs and refills the glasses promptly.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114081412658499724979/reviews
