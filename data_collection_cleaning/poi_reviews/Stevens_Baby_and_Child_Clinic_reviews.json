      "text": "We rushed our child to the clinic after he displayed a worrying symptom of being unable to turn his neck. Throughout the diagnosis, Dr Steven displayed an arrogant and condescending attitude. Prematurely (mis)diagnosing the symptoms as a very likely case of meningitis, he quickly recommended admission and the immediate use of a risky and invasive procedure that requires drawing spinal fluid. He dismissed us when we questioned further on the use of other assessments such as X-Ray. With courage, my husband and I took the decision of seeking a second opinion with another hospital.\n\nWhen we left the clinic, Steven's attitude was simply bad and unprofessional and did not display the slightest medical concern for the patient. Instead, like a pushy salesperson, he tried to use scare tactics to retain us and was highly agitated when we insisted on a second opinion elsewhere.\n\nFast forward. All's good. It turned out to be a case of a lymph node infection which was resolved through the use of antibiotics.\n\nIt was quite an ordeal which I hope other parents would not have to face.",

Dr Steven Ng was very patient and gentle in his explanations and thorough in his preliminary investigations, and does not recommended excessive investigations that are not necessary in his opinion. He deserve 5 stars.",

Putting us as first time parents at ease.\n\nWhen we go back for our son’s check-up and injections, Dr Ng always take time and make sure all our queries are answered. He is very thorough and patient.
