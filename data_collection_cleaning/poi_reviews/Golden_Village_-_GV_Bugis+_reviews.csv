Sharina Bynes,4,"Had a pleasant time watching a movie. Not too overcrowded; all was in order. Downside was the theatre only opens 5min before showtime; it used to be 10-15min prior.

Good seats; arm rests could be lifted up. Clean.

They should make movies a bit more affordable. $100 for a family of 4 with snacks for a weekend is not something everyone can afford.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112455686131891152322/reviews
Wesley Wong,4,"The GV cinema at Bugis + boasts modern cleanliness and comfort. Their provision of booster seats for kids shows considerate attention to customer needs. With an impressive Dolby sound system and comfortable temperature, the viewing experience is top-notch. However, the placement of a restaurant behind the ticket gate raises questions about accessibility for patrons who may not be purchasing movie tickets.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107433449088212182977/reviews
Chénet Lisa,3,"I'm visiting Singapore for 4 months and I really wanted to try a cinema. The room was clean, the film was good, but it was way too cold! And I don't know if it's normal here, but people were talking/shouting/reacting to the film throughout the entire session (we couldn't watch in peace).",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105625604764612126123/reviews
Chee Hwa Tang,4,"Nice environment for a movie, clean bathroom. The air conditioning, as usual, is quite cold, so remember to bring a jacket if you cannot handle it, just in case.

As I am someone who is very rarely buy food and drinks from the counter, I cannot comment on that. Just purely the movie experience, it is decent.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113046194866842315990/reviews
Rennie Lee,1,"Theatre was good, but giving 1 ⭐️ for the popcorn counter. Went to get a popcorn combo for the movie but the service was terrible.

The staff didn’t ask at all and just assumed we were getting a large popcorn combo. When we saw the price at $13, we were shocked as we were looking at the poster on the counter side for a $11+ combo (usual price). Cinema menus are all over the place so we didn’t see any large combo price near the counter or flashing on the screen. We tried clarifying but the staff just wasn’t able to explain properly to us, saying it’s a special promo but we kept explaining we are looking at the part which labeled $11+ as the usual price. Finally, we realized the $11+ price was for regular combo but he gave us the large combo without asking. It’s been some time since I visited the cinema so we wouldn’t know - even bbt shops ask every time if the customer want regular or large size?!

Also, we didn’t want ice in our drink as the cinema would be cold already. So we asked if we could have no ice (it’s normally chargeable at 30cents), less drink is fine. But the staff was not flexible at all. Didn’t even explain if it’s not allowed as a company policy (which if that’s the case, acceptable), he just repeated that no he had to charge 30 cent without further explanation.

Mood was slightly ruined even before the movie started… Didn’t really want to argue with the counter staff so we just took the combo he packed. Tbh, we are okay with paying $13 if we knew upfront. Just felt kinda cheated plus the staff counter assumed the order, didn’t explain clearly on everything and wasn’t flexible.

Bad experience…",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104896149882118051128/reviews
