Le Tian,5,"We had an amazing coffee brewing session at Compound Coffee Co. The team was incredibly friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. We went there for a friend’s birthday celebration, and they were so meticulous and thoughtful in making the experience special. Not only did we learn a lot about brewing and tasting coffee, but we also had a fantastic time with their super awesome team. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a fun and educational coffee experience!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103056323245167240397/reviews
