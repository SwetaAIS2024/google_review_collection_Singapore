Just like most Shine Korea outlets, this outlet is very well stocked and offers a very wide variety of products.\n\nGenerally, I would recommend this outlet as it is slightly quieter and lesser known as the outlet at Bugis Street is seemingly more popular.",

Imagine chronic illness person took it and lead to critical situation.",
