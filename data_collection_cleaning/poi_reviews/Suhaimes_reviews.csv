MuhammadHazri Junaidi,5,"We would like to recommend this place to eat and will come back for sure. Great place to chill over the weekends and holidays! Lots of food option. Read the feedback below:

Location: Very convenient as it is easy to access and there are plenty of parking lots, also near to Jalan Sultan Exp way/Tuas checkpoint/Sultan Abu Bakar immigration/Legoland/Sunway Bigbox/Puteri Harbour!

Food & Drink: Tasted their teh tarik and nasi lemak, looks simple but it was super nice. Not exaggerating, but its the fact! Can be the next top nasi lemak in JB!!

Price: Affordable and reasonable price!!

Service: The service is satisfactory! Seem like they just opened this shop. But, theres always a room of improvement!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106102130025311258337/reviews
noorsham mnoor,2,"Need to improve, really! Asam  pedas is not really Asam pedas, not the Johor nor Malacca type anyway. Had to  send back the fish head as it was undercooked. Other food so so, most of  us didn't finish what we ordered. Slow service even though only 2 tables were occupied. Agreed that taste is subjective but if the whole group thinks the same when everyone had a different dish then go figure.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109371238379317341929/reviews
