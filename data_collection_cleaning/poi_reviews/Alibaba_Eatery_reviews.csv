Jun Guan Tan,3,"Located in the industrial area of mandai

Came here at a 9pm on a weekday.
Ordered Chinese Food and had mala xiang Guo.
Slightly better than average food, but the Chinese man may not be as hygienic, not wearing gloves when receiving my mala xiang Guo order and using hands to bring the ingredients to the weighing scale.
Not bad for a late night dinner.
Can consider should you have a motorcycle 🏍️ 🏍️ 🏍️ 🏍️
