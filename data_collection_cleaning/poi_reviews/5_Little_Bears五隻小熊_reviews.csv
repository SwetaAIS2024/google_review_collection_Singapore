Clarence Ow,4,"They have quite a cute shop name. If you do not take a closer look, you might not know they are actually serving Taiwanese food.

Their food are actually very affordable and the portion is absolutely generous. The braised pork rice is a big portion. Very comforting to eat, slightly sweet, but it taste well.

Big chicken cutlet is great. Not too much flour and you could have a mouthful of chicken in every bite. The chicken is really big and alone can be a full meal for some.

However, i find the chicken can be quite salty and if you are eating the whole chicken by yourself, it can become quite Jelak. I strongly recommend sharing the chicken.

Overall, good place to go on a cheat day.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112234615480628100933/reviews
J Kwa,3,"Ordered a portion of tempura for takeaway. $3.50 for this is considered cheap given the current economy, but I was not expecting such a small portion. Tempura also had a slightly fishy taste to it. Comparing prices and quality, Shilin definitely does it better!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111043741228918832952/reviews
IsForGames Dude01,2,Looks good right? But is far from good. The most average. Honey chicken chop taste same from pasar malam just they added a lot more salt n spoil the taste. The veggie n tomato r cold. Y is it cold? No preheat? The winter gourd drink also from can which u can buy from ntuc duh... The cabbage is seriously overcook. The service from the crew is the worst. The aunty behave like we own them 1 million. The younger lady responded NAH ur chili. Wonder y so many supporters. 1st n last time.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114038492684096202223/reviews
Rio Wang,3,"Chicken Chop bento. Went past this Taiwanese food place a few times and finally tried it today. Fried chicken is crispy, slightly too salty, side dishes in bento weren't good. Should try the Mee Sua and braised pork next time.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103067140074042430707/reviews
nat reviews,4,"Food: 4/5
Everything was well done expect for the salted crispy chicken. Man, that dish needs to be taken off. The batter was sticky and not crispy and chicken was hard and dry. Funnily, they did the honey glazed chicken really well. I would’ve imagined that they used the same method but with the addition of either honey or salt.

Service: 4/5
Nothing out of the ordinary, but everything was smooth.

Atmosphere: 5/5
At the dining area, they have these cute light lanterns that really sets a playful mood. And on the sides, they’ll be selling some popular Taiwanese snacks from different parts of Taiwan.

I will be back!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105973186058375958042/reviews
