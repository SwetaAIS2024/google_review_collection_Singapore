Clarence,3,"Terriyaki burger was good, I rarely eat at MOS burger but that day we had no choice as other food outlets are jam pack. Went on a Saturday Breakfast, Food came out about 30 mins since we ordered. Hope to improve in service, put additional kitchen staff",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114551462450889770333/reviews

 ç…æ…¥,4,"Visited on a non-peak hour on a weekday. At around 4pm.

Had only few groups of patrons.

Had to wait awhile for my 2 items.

Clam chowder is good.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103383404265528637492/reviews
SM S,1,"For the management reading this, kindly inform your staff that if your outlet serves hot drinks, you're bound to have stirrers. I ordered an ice tea today and it came with 2 pods of creamer. Obviously i would have needed a stirrer. I asked your staff serving the food (pink shirt), for one, her response to me was, ""we don't have stirrers, you just open the cover, pour in the creamer and mix it by shaking your drink."" üò≥ really, MOS? this is your level of service? I've been here a couple of times, i've clearly asked for stirrers before and have gotten it each time. I then walked out to the front counter and asked a lady in green for a stirrer and she provided me with one. So why was it so difficult to provide your customers for one in the first place? Do better, MOS.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108002367464390864256/reviews
Donald Isaac,3,"Just popped in for a quick lunch. I have not had this for a while. The chicken teriyaki is still good. Beef burger was not great. I didn‚Äôt like the taste of the patty. The clam chowder was good for a fast food outlet.

The menu have evolved since MOS opened in Singapore. Some pork items are gone and the hot dog now is chicken which is not great.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111620843433357170307/reviews
