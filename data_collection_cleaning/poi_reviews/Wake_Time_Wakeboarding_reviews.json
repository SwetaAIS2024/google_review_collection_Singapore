We were initially afraid that we'll bring his \"passing rate\" of 95% down, but now we know why even first timers can do well on their first try!\n\nJim is a great coach especially for us beginners, giving cues and feedback for us to feel confident on the board. We really enjoyed ourselves and felt confident to try new things with his guidance.\n\nHaving Lexi with us on the boat was a great plus ðŸ™ŒðŸ’¯",

Jim was friendly and encouraging, and great with giving clear, structured and easy-to-understand tips and theory behind wakeboarding techniques. It being my first time, I felt assured that he was very experienced and knowledgeable, and mindful of safety. I could feel his passion for not just the sport, but teaching as well! 5/5 stars!
