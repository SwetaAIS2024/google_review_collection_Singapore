CK Cheong,3,"This eatery has three stalls - Kway Chap, Ampang Yong Tau Fu and drinks. Tried the Ampang Yong Tau Fu which was basically the normal Yong Tau Fu (assorted vegetables with minced meat) in gravy and no soup. The food tasted decent but not exceptional. Worth a try if you are in the area",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114524725497942089541/reviews
Mei Juan,1,"We specifically asked for small portions, but were served a huge plate instead. When we brought it up, the staff just told us to pack the leftovers. We're on the move. Who wants to carry food around while traveling?

It was our first time here, and definitely the last. The stuffed tofu and kway chap weren’t just bland, they were simply not good. There were no prices displayed anywhere, and the final bill was surprisingly high. It really felt like the owner was just trying to squeeze money out of customers.

This place isn’t even particularly popular, yet somehow people still go and eat there, we honestly can’t figure out why.

Totally not worth it. Never again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113950073382787580291/reviews
Weiii,3,"Went to buy for takeaway on Friday 6pm. Place was quite empty and I found out why.
The YTF was lacking of taste, not the MSG kind. All I taste was MSG. The FUCHOK would taste better if you wash them before frying. It is so tasty my hair dropped instantly.
I added brinjal YTF. Very disappointing, almost couldn’t find the fish paste..
The duck was alright. The sauce was quite salty, I can hardly taste any fragrance or herbalish taste..
It has definitely lost the fragrance they used to have 10+ years ago. I believe a lot of improvement needs to be done.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106778064464363662162/reviews
Zhanrong Liang,2,Can't mix the ingredients with the sauce as the sauce was so salty. The guy in spectacles was so inconsistent as he allowed another lady to select what she wanted and told me that i could only order for 1 or 2 pax set meal. This made me feel that the service level was bad.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102399910804636306936/reviews
tammy tan (tam2travel),4,"This restaurant is just beside the Kallang MRT. It's a big serving for 2 pax at reasonable price. The pig intestines were properly cleaned and cooked, and they tasted really good. The kuay chap was soft and smooth. The ambang yong tau foo was ok.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100528170319568539036/reviews
