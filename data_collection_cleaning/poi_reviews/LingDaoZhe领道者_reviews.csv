Gwen W,3,"Should have known when we saw no customers in the restaurant.

The tomato soup and Chengdu Mala soup base had a strange after taste. We thought they might have used the 牛油 to cook.. but server says it’s not. Would not recommend either broth.

Good thing is meat portions are generous.

Very filling meal but not satisfying.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110488977615879239891/reviews

钦伟,1,"Please, what kind of rotten store is this? Can you please not come out and harm people? Ordered something and waited 30 minutes for it to be served? Other people's hot pot didn't take as long as you did. What's the chef doing? Sleeping or dreaming? Are the waiters and clerks all foreign workers, not Chinese? Oh my God, the customers didn’t clean up their food after eating. They waited almost an hour after we finished eating before picking it up. There is only one private room in the store, and we also smelled smoke inside. Maybe the store allows customers to smoke inside🤷🏻‍♂️I don’t know, but! ! ! Please avoid this hotpot restaurant. Really, we waited for 1 hour for the pumpkin pie. We kept asking the counter staff how long we need to wait for our food. There was no response. We will never come here again, and we will not let our friends come over to suffer🙏🏻Store owner, if you see this comment, please contact me. I don’t mind telling you how miserable your hotpot restaurant is by your workers, or improve your store, thank you",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108113482974991404336/reviews
