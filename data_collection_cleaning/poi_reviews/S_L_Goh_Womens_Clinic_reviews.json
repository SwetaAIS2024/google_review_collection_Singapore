      "text": "This is my second pregnancy under the care of Dr. Goh. My first pregnancy with her was smooth and uncomplicated. However, this second pregnancy has been quite different from the first.\n\nI was diagnosed with preeclampsia, but Dr. Goh closely monitored my condition and made a firm, timely decision that we could not delay delivery any further. She emphasized the importance of delivering as soon as possible for the safety of both myself and my baby.\n\nThroughout the process, Dr. Goh has always been patient in answering all my questions. When it came to making critical decisions, she remained calm, firm, and reassuring, giving me great confidence that both my baby and I were in safe hands.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Goh to anyone looking for a dedicated and experienced obstetrician. You will definitely be in good hands. I also want to thanks the wonderful staff at Dr. Gohâ€™s clinic â€” they have always been attentive and helpful in addressing all my pregnancy-related queries.",

      "text": "A big thank you to Dr Goh and team - for all the care and support throughout the entire pregnancy journey! Dr Goh is very experienced and both her professionalism alongside with her calm demeanor had provided my husband and I so much comfort and assurance especially as first-time parents. We also had positive experiences throughout each consultation visit as all the staffs are also very helpful, highly efficient and very organized/ systematic! Delivery was very swift and smooth (no doubt we felt very assured that we will be in good hands with Dr Goh) and recovery was quick as well. Incredibly grateful to have Dr Goh and teamâ€™s care during my entire pregnancy journey, so much so that it was a smooth sailing one. Big thank you once again! ðŸ©µ",
