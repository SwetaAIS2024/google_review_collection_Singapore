Lenon Tan,4,"Table QR order and pay (has ApplePay!) Self-collect by pager system.

Coffee strong and aromatic, kaya not too sweet, carrot cake dry version was flavourful, french toasts were not bad. Half-boiled eggs were still watery, dark soy sauce was the sweet type.

Service was friendly and efficient. Bonus point for greeting every customer, even when returning tray.

Environment was clean and cosy.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108531854195491062188/reviews
averruncushd,4,"We really really liked the slow-cooked beef; it was our absolute favourite. I also really liked the coconut rice. We didnâ€™t enjoy the ribs, despite recommendations.

Warren Yap,5,"The place is quiet to sit down and chill. The food is good, ordered the toast set, eggs were well prepared at the right liquidity.

Benny Sng,1,"Review in March 2025:
Food: 0/5
Service: 3/5
Atmosphere: 4/5

The food here tastes awful now. It used to be good, but there's a change in management/staff and both the food and drinks are terribly disappointing now.

The fried white carrot cake went from being fragrant to becoming moist and bland. Chee cheong fun used to be smooth and silky, but is now a sticky and chewy mess.

The tea (iced teh si kosong) tasted weird too. There's no longer a fragrant tea and milk flavour; it tastes more pungent.

Not to mention that the trays now are all visibly wet. Previously, the trays were clean and dry. All in all, it's an awful and unsatisfactory experience to the extent that we did not finish the food.

Darren,1,"Very disappointed with the Black Carrot cake today from Killiney @ serene center. Ordered my usual black carrot cake which I love and it came burnt black without being cooked with the black sweet sauce. When I went to the counter and told the 2 counter assistant this is not black carrot cake but burnt white carrot cake. They said itâ€™s black what, it is black carrot cake. Ok that why I think they deserve this 1 star review. As I think they should not sell black carrot cake if they ran out of black sweet sauce and deny it saying it black when itâ€™s not! Really dissapointing coming from the place I visit almost every weekðŸ‘Ž",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102487992781914973590/reviews
