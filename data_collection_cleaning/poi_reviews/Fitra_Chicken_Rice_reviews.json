      "text": "I already tried many chicken rice shop in Singapore but I think Fitra is the best one in all of that. I like the rice, pineapples slices, pickled cucumber and their sauces are different from other shops. Chicken not much need to chew and it easily melting in my mouth. Mustard also cut my small pieces and it is very easy to eat. I give rating 10/10\nfor food and 9/10 for services",

Chicken is average without much sauce. Normally for this amount there will be a separated plate for the ingredient and rice but this is just honestly not worth the price and not worth coming back.",
