      "text": "#01-89 Somerset Fishball Noodle. In my opinion 4.9/5 for their fishball noodle. Simply amazing! Fishball, saito fishball, fishcake, you can taste the masterly handmade taste. Ive never really enjoy fishball noodles, be it dry or soup because of their lousy fishy fish balls that dont compliment the dish. This Thumbs up. i had the upsize $5 meepok dry. Loads of ingredients , ended up cant finish the meepok, but i whacked the fins! Beside a grumpy, angry stall owner, i think its worth your trip if you want to reignite your taste buds for fishball noodle.",
