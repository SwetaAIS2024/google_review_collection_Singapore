Eugene Lim,5,"Want to give a shoutout to the 2 male doctors on staff.

Went to 3 GPs before seeing them and they were able to diagnose me instantly. I was very ill and had to be hospitalised for a week.

Every other GP was saying I have ‚Äúflu‚Äù or ‚Äúfever‚Äù but the doctors here knew something was up and didn‚Äôt dismiss my concerns.

Most experiences I had with doctors in Singapore has been absolutely horrendous and honestly I could be a doctor myself at this point.

But the doctors here at Newest? Absolute lads!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110500550679529024209/reviews
Eddie Ow,5,"I had been their patient for years and have no issue with the receptionist. They are friendly and helpful with extended service to patients.
There was once while waiting in the clinic, I heard the receptionist asking if needed to write Chinese wording for the medicine as the patient is Chinese educated.
While I would says, respects are gained through actions and mutually. Treats others as per how you want to be treated. "" Customers is always right"" when u respects the service provider.

Eddie Wong,1,"I don‚Äôt even have the chance to give them business. Lucky me. Tried calling them many times over 2 days during operational hours but nobody pick up. Left message on their business WhatsApp also never reply. Finally they answered my call this morning. I asked her why it‚Äôs so difficult to get hold of them and why they never read their WhatsApp. She said unapologetically ‚Äúbusy‚Äù ‚Äúno time to answer calls‚Äù. So when I told them what I need and want to make an appointment. She just said that they don‚Äôt take appointments, come down before 11am. So I told her I can‚Äôt make it and might have to go other clinics then, she said ‚Äúok, thank you‚Äù üò°",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116758212857225843154/reviews
Mavis Lim,5,"I had an outstanding experience at Newest Medical & Laser Clinic and I want to specifically highlight the amazing work of both the receptionist and the doctor. The receptionist was efficient, and organized, making the check-in process smooth and quick. They answered all my questions with professionalism, setting a positive tone for my visit.
Dr Low Wymin was equally impressive, taking the time to thoroughly listen to my concerns and providing clear, thoughtful advice. I felt truly cared for by both the receptionist and the doctor. Their teamwork and commitment to patient care made my experience exceptional. Highly recommend this clinic!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117739204371119239483/reviews
Pine Ong,5,"I've been a patient at this clinic since 2022 and consistently received smooth service from the Receptionist. They demonstrate remarkable helpfulness, expertise, and organization.

Their systematic approach ensures seamless experiences for patients. I appreciate how they adhere to standard operating procedures (SOPs), maintaining clarity and consistency for all patients. This attention to detail prevents misunderstandings and fosters trust.

The Receptionists' professionalism and efficiency make a significant positive impact on my overall experience. I highly recommend this clinic for its exemplary patient care and administrative excellence.""",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110313662487272285907/reviews
