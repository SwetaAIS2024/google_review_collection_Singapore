Rachel CL,5,Love this international school based on Christian value. Teachers are very nurturing and class sizes are small so each student gets high individual attention. IB scores have been improving over the years. Kudos to the principal and teaching staff.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113941130747852800100/reviews
Suzanne Ng,5,The school has great pastoral care and wonderful responsible teachers. My daughter has challenges fitting in when she transfered in year 2. And her mentor and school counsellor helped to reach out to make her feel at ease.  Also the parent association is very united and supportive. They arrange occasional catch up in the mornings with the Principal to share updates and gather feedback. Would certainly recommend the school.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106118629407211005224/reviews
Emma Lee,5,"Such a normal school in all the right ways.  Small class sizes, welcoming staff, caring teachers, strong pastoral care system and values.  Opportunities to try and take part in lots of different CCAs without needing to be a world champion.  No huge fancy campus, but well equipped classrooms filled with student's work and colour. They get great academic results, without being too academically selective, because the children are empowered, happy, and taught well.  If only more schools could be like this, and the planet may be a happier place.  If you are looking at other top schools like SJI-I, think again and try out ACS-I too.  It's a pleasant change.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106581390893649590871/reviews
Suzanne Ho,5,"We went for the 3 Open houses for the local international school, SJI, HCI and ACSI. We loved the camderie and eloquent students at ACSI who took us through the school and explained the process. Once we decided to enroll. The process was seemless, with proactive follow up from school admin. We look forward to  good holistic experience. The results year on year has improved for the IB too, well done.
Next stop, University.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106324451545736437317/reviews
HT,1,Getting your child admitted to this school should be the last resort. Do it only if your childâ€™s results do not allow him or her to go somewhere else. This school is poorly run. Hopefully the new principal can make it better. The yearly IB results are poor when compared to other competing schools.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100841175532556589491/reviews
