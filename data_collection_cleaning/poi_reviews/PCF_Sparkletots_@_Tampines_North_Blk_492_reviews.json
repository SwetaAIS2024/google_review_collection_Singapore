      "text": "Was doing a flexi job in a new hdb flat and was quite late for the appointment. Taking bus, raining without umbrella and was confuse of the blocks which have lots of alphabet. But thankfully, 1 of the nursery teacher coincidencely alighting the bus with me to send items to 492a before going for her vacation. I was looking for 492E . She invites me to walk together as we are going to the same area.Both without umbrella, walking in a fast pace but the nice thing was that she really did led me on until we really find the block , and pointed out 492E right in front of us. It’s a fulfilling thoughts now to be sure that whoever child whom were send to this nursery, rest assure that child is in good hand and being well taken care of. Keep up the good work Teachers!",
