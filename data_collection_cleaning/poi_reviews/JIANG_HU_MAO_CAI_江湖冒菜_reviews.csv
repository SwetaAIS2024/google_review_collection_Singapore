Jason Lee,5,"Restaurant was not crowded during lunch time on Saturday.

Ordered 江湖辣子鸡. The chicken cubes were tasty and crispy, but too bad no peanuts were added.

麻辣烤鱼 was also good. Surprisingly the fish was not cooked throughly even after they deep fried. It's fine as it was cooked after we left it awhile inside the boiling soup. Will try their other dishes next round.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117371894884760957562/reviews
