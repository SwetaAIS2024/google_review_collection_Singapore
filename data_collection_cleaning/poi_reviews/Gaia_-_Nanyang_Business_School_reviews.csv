Aisha Jumari,4,"saw this sign at gaia building!

code choice and preference: words are written in all caps to index urgency! there are also no proper punctuation, it's just a block of text. there are symbols above the text so multiple modes are used. i'm guessing the arrow is to convey the direction... not sure about the arrows pointing towards the people sign?

inscription: the white font in caps is contrasted against a green background which is unusual because red usually indexes emergencies... design is simple and conveys the message. the arrow symbol is useful but not the other symbol.

Emplacement: placed at some random corridor at gaia, really missable. if this is an important sign, shouldn't it be highlighted more...? i dunno",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106489416134812464181/reviews
