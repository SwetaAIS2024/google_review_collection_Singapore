Leonard Chong,5,"5 stars for the price. Cheap and palatable mee hoon soto with 2 x bergedil at $4.50.
Nasi lemak, mee soto, mee siam and mee goreng each at $3.50 only. Weekends not open, very pity.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101585984216350252104/reviews
CK C,5,"Malay stall there sells typical fare such as Nasi padang, Mee rebus Mee siam and Lontong. The noodles cost $3.50 a plate. Food was above average and staff were all very friendly. E-payment available too.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Goo Bakmi,4,"Old nostalgic place for simple Malay food operating in the 90s when I was working in this area.  Used to be in an old coffeeshop along Margaret drive next to Queenstown library before moving to this location. Best eaten in the morning when they are freshly prepared, especially the small curry puff.  Reasonable pricing and generous portion for $3.50 for most dishes. Food is still good and service is prompt.  Only problem is the limited parking and seatings in the coffeeshop.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104071409397230107746/reviews
Feliz,4,"A great Malay nasi Padang to try .
Like really home cook type.

If you buy asam fish it will cost you more .

Look at my photo . The asam fish alone cost $5.50

Today, I spend in total $10.50 including $2 mini curry puff -4 pieces .

Overall ok lah.. inflation mah.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116157125905421525141/reviews
Mano Renjan,3,"Only the mee rebus was ok. Tahu goreng was disappointing. There are other stalls which give better food and dining experience.
