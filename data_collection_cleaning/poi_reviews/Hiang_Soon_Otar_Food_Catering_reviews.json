We could smell the fragrance from quite a distance away which lured us to this place. ðŸ˜‹\nOtah starts from 80 cents and I would say is a decent portion. Saw a few reviews saying it's too thin (maybe they improved?) and price increases need to consider real food costs money and labour. ðŸ˜…\n\nWill definitely come back for more!",

However, upon opening it for consumption, I discovered that it contained a disappointingly thin layer of fish meat. In comparison, otah I've bought from elsewhere has proven to be of better quality and cheaper. Additionally, the people at this place tend to be quite persistent in their attempts to upsell other products. Never gonna buy from them again.",
