      "text": "Tried this OK Chicken Rice at their other outlets before. Glad to see that it‚Äôs here in Punggol, so near to where I stay. Halal, so more options for Muslim neighbours. üëçüèº\n\nTried a few of the items on their menu since its opening and enjoyed some discounts. Such as the Lemon Cutlet Chicken, Roasted Chicken Rice, 1/2 Steamed Chicken and even chicken laksa for a few time.\n\nOverall strongly recommended. It‚Äôs nice. Just find their soup taste weird.. üòÖ and the service can be better as one time clear instruction given no bean sprout for chicken laksa but end up upon reaching home disappointed that there are bean sprout. üò•\n\nF&B is not easy. Other than good food, reasonable pricing, customer service also must be up to standard. If not consumer will support less and eventually due to low sales and high rental cost, will have to move out just like how previous western food stall didn‚Äôt survive long.\n\nSo, Keep it up! üí™üèª",

      "text": "I recently visited a new stall and tried their prawn laksa and hum laksa, and I was thoroughly impressed! The prawn laksa had a rich, aromatic broth that perfectly balanced spices and coconut milk, making each sip comforting and satisfying. The prawns were fresh and cooked to perfection, adding a delightful sweetness.\n\nThe hum laksa was equally amazing, featuring tender cockles that added a unique brininess to the dish. The broth was just as flavorful, and the combination of noodles and toppings made for a hearty meal.\n\nOverall, the stall offers a fantastic experience with generous portions and vibrant flavors. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes! Highly recommend for laksa lovers!",
