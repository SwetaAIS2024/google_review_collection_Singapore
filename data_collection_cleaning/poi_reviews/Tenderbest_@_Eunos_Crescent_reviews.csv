Edwin Teh,1,"Ordered the beef steak but was shock at the size and thickness of the beef steak. Its not worth the value of $11.90, I can get a decent 200gram beef steak at Char Grill for just $10.90. This is my first and will be my last to patronise this stall.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106656211683754149642/reviews
BB T,1,"Fries are over cooked, all are in dark brown colour and super hard to eat. Very disappointed in the food that they serve now, standard is not like before and the price is not cheap as a hawker western in the first place. Not going back ever.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109463208419613396407/reviews
