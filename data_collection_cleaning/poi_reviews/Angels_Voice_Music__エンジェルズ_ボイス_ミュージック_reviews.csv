Kanamin Channel,5,"I used to self learn how to sing but I felt I can‚Äôt improve anymore‚Ä¶ After singing a song in-front of Ryna-san, she gave me few advices and went through a simple practice.
When I sang the same song later on, it was a huge difference! (Should have recorded!)
It was easier to sing and sounded better!
Learned that it‚Äôs not how loud you can sing but need to understand how to control your voice!
A very fruitful 60min‚ù§Ô∏èüé§
Will bring my husband next time so that he can sing better in Karaoke HAHHAHAHA",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114304915584783053245/reviews
Angie Lim,5,"I really had a great experience in attending Ryna Sensei‚Äôs singing lessons. I had voice training from different mentors. So far she is one of my best mentors. I had been learning from her for more than 5 years for J pops songs to ensure the pronunciation is up to Japanese standard. I was one of the finalists in JAS NHK karaoke competition and performed 2 songs on her Angel live k on event with proper musician. Thanks to her I passed the audition. She always encourages her students to sing their favorite Japanese songs. She encouraged us to use our natural voice to sing the covers instead of copying the original singers. Until now I‚Äôm still her loyal students.

Mayuko,5,"Ms. Lina's voice training was a great experience for me.
The teacher's lessons are tailored to the student's needs, so you can enjoy every lesson.
