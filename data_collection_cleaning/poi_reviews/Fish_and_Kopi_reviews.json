There’s no service but staff was friendly and place is air conditioned.",

I am happy to find a place where I can have something healthy (fish soup with vegetable) and something sweet (peanut waffle). The soup was savoury and it helped to wash down the peanut from the waffle.\n\nI reached at around 2pm which was after work. I have found a new quiet place to dine at and chill after work.",

      "text": "$7 for a medium sized decent fish soup. Good broth. Fresh Batang fish used. You must add +++$$ for more ingredients like egg bomb. Not the most generous with ingredients but since it is located inside an aircon mall, you pay for the aircon and exclusive shop space dedicated to only Fish Soup, coffee and tea and homemade waffles. The signature chilli Belacan is a hit and miss and rather stale as it is bubbly and watery, sitting in the tube container for the longest time. The red cut chilli is barely available and swimming in a tub of soya sauce and chilli seeds. The service is cut and dry, take it or leave it. The tables are also often dirty and not cleaned, so you have to DIY.",
