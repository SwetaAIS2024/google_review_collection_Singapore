      "text": "+ The only coffeeshop in the Haw Par Villa area. There's a dearth of cheap eating options nearby (next nearest hawker centres are Pasir Panjang and West Coast HCs which are quite faraway).\n\n+ Food variety is decent. Unfortunately, the cheap and great Sin Thor Eunos BaKuTeh has moved away post-coffeeshop renovation/takeover, although there's now a new Hao Tian BKT but starting price is now $6.\n\n+ Airy due to the high ceiling.\n\n- EDITED: The SFA had announced in Feb 2024 the kiosk-based Visitor Management System (which requires online/ kiosk registration before entry), but yet to introduce it after complaints by tenants that it affects business.\n\n- Parking is problematic due to the limited lots for visitors, unless you park at the far end of the Wholesale Centre. Walking from car to coffeeshop can be a hazard due to the movement of many lorries and forklifts.",
