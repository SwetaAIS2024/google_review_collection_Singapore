Post-session, I felt an immediate lightness in my temples and a surprising clarity—my eyes felt less strained which helped diminish my fatigue I've been carrying for days. Highly recommended her.",

Dr Gabriel is friendly and knowledgeable, and his diagnosis is quick and accurate.\nIt was a good experience from the moment I entered the clinic, which has a calm and cosy atmosphere. The staff are very pleasant too.\nAlthough TCM isn't cheap, I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a long-term solution to their health issues.",

Dr. Judy was very kind and professional at curing my symptoms.  After getting acupuncture and taking medicine, I was getting better and then recover.  She told me that she can do facial acupuncture.  I’ll try it next time.",
