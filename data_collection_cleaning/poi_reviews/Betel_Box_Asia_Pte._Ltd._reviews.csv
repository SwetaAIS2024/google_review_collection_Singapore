Victoria Ortiz,5,"Tony will go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable. They send you a brochure with lots of information about what to do in Singapore and how to move around.
We stayed in the 5 bed female dorm which was very spacious and lovely.
The shared bathrooms were clean and equipped with the basics.
Also, the commo area was huge and they even sell drinks. Last but not least, breakfast was basic but very handy in such an expensive country.
Everything was pretty good. Some toilets on the third floor were tiny and I kept getting wet with the shower by mistake but it wasn't a big deal. Also, bear in mind that prices are usually high everywhere and although it was one of the cheapest options, still far more expensive than any other country in the area.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102771720936744132632/reviews
Hamish Sinclair,5,"Great time, friendly staff, good level of amenities + cleanliness for the cost. Common area is perfect if you want to chat, also air conditioning at night was amazing. Very welcoming atmosphere, felt very safe and staff were very attentive to my friends and I. One very minor complaint- check in could be faster, but even then, didn’t take too long and we happened to come at a busy time. Awesome hostel, highly recommend.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110482023631671265454/reviews
Shani Levi,2,"Pros
•	Affordable – One of the cheapest options in Singapore.
•	Free breakfast – Basic (just bread and tea/coffee), but a nice perk.
•	Facilities – Has a fridge for guests to use.
•	Convenient location – Close to a FairPrice grocery store, a hawker center, laundry services, and a night market.

Cons
•	WiFi issues – You have to reconnect every day, and the process is very tedious. If you have multiple devices, you’ll need to do it for each one.
•	No extra amenities – No towels provided, and you have to make your own bed.
•	Lack of social atmosphere – Not many events or opportunities to meet people.
•	Cramped facilities – The bathrooms are tiny, with the shower and toilet in the same stall, so the floor is always wet.
•	Poor bathroom conditions – No toiletries provided; the soap dispenser was filled with water, and there were no paper towels.
•	Inconvenient location – About 45 minutes from most major attractions by public transportation.
•	Noisy at night – Quiet hours are not enforced. In my experience, a guest in the women’s dorm ate strong-smelling food and talked loudly on the phone in the bathroom, and the staff didn’t intervene.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110898019882196614828/reviews
Michael Lindsay,4,"Pros
- cheapest option
- super friendly staff with local knowledge
- nice location
- steamy hot showers with solid pressure
- free breakfast
- free book exchange
- bike/scouter hire

Cons
- less sociable than other hostels I’ve been to; however this, from what I’ve heard, is very typical of backpacking through Singapore.

- the rooms feel small and overcrowded; however I could have opted for a smaller dorm for a marginally higher price.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100243657530213744594/reviews
Philipp Schlick,4,"Its a good hostel for that price. I stayed several nights in the same room, which was cleaned every day. There are lockers which are a little too small for a big travelling backpack, but you can def. store your most important things in there In general it was a very clean hostel. The location is ok. 15min walk to a MRT (subway) and several bus stops are close by. Would go there again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100867112105107340201/reviews
