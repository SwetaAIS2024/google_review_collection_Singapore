Evelyn Eve,1,"Been calling the school, recorded the noise level and emailed the principal and MOE regards to their morning assembly, mid day concert and rehearsal.

None of them take action. Very inconsiderate school management!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101049475398465257186/reviews
Ana Johan,1,"School front desk lady not helpful. We were not clear on what document to photocopy. So we went there with the document we have, and proceed to collect our FAS books. Then the bookshop and uniform needs 2 copies of the same document. My husband asked the office lady nicely, she just told to my husband rudely, why u don’t bring extra copy? And CONTINUE playing with her hp. Then an Indian  admin lady helped my hubby to do it instead. If we need to pay, pls say so. But don’t treat us like a dog just because we are FAS parents. It’s not ur money we ask for. Thank you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110767525871682070100/reviews
