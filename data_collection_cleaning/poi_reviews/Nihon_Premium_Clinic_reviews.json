All the doctors are Japanese.\nAll the doctors are kind and listen to me with compassion. I felt that the examinations and treatment were better than those at hospitals in Japan. At the end of the examination, they always ask me if there is anything else I'm concerned about, so it's easy to ask. I'm relieved to have found such a good hospital since coming to Singapore.\nThey are also very good at dealing with children, which is helpful.\n\nThe pharmacist explains things in English, but the doctor explains the medicine thoroughly during the examination, so it's not a problem even if you don't understand.\nThere are both Japanese and local people at the reception, and they are all very nice.",
