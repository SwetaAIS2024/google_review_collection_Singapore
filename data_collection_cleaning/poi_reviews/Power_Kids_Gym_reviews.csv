Jan Chan,4,"Hosted a kid‚Äôs birthday party at the gym and I Scream Cafe, the ‚Äúall in package‚Äù is a drop off the kids, adults can relax and socialize. The kids enjoyed the activities planned. Price is slightly higher but given that hosting families can rest and socialize, it is still worth it. * Kudos to the team to help put up the decoration!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114105489189999222252/reviews
