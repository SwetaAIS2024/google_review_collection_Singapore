And an entire fridge full of various different pickles and kimchi! Really need to take your time to browse. The supermarket is clean and well organised, and shopping here is comfortable. The staff seems to be foreign but he was courteous and had a smile. If you love Korean products you should come and spend some time looking thru here. Really great and unique stuff that you can't find in any other supermarkets",
