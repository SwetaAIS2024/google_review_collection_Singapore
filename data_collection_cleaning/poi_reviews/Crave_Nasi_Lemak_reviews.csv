Sharon,1,"No STAR for all!!!

I have unpleasant experience with your foods and staffs. Firstly, I have encountered few times that I need to wait for longer time after payment made at kiosk.Hence this time,I ordered thru foodpanda as pick up order cos I have bad experience on waiting.

I have arrived 11:20 after ordering as the app stated 11:12 for pick up time.
To my horror, I didn't see a trace of my order. I asked the counter staff when will my order be ready, she shouted oh Foodpanda order.  Coming coming.... I sat quietly and waited awhile n approached them again the lady said 10mins so I walked out and get my other stuffs.
When I went bk,the order still not ready, with no choice as I already paid for the food so I waited another 10mins. After good 15mins, I went to ask again they replied unhappily not ready not ready !! Pardon me,I should be the one who feel unhappy cos I waited far too long!!!
Your staffs seem not organized and take a longer time for preparation.
Once opened the box, the fried chicken skin is burnt and hard due to high heat!!

Hope the management can help to educate your staffs with time management and effectiency.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110949640288924731113/reviews

Jr Lim,2,"They charge 30c for extra chilli. Otherwise a good plate of nasilemak.

Edited: charging 30c for chilli on a $6.9 nasi lemak is quite a turnoff. Portion is pretty small, rice is little, and chicken isn't great. But still overall a good plate.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116730822572936862131/reviews

Ricky KH,4,The kiosk had a credit card function but didn’t accept any cards — I was forced to use PayNow instead. Ended up wasting a lot of time and had to re-enter my entire order.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116769386981173000604/reviews
