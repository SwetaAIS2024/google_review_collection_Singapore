      "text": "I ran from Bedok Reservoir to check out the newly opened Tampines Boulevard Park, which just launched last week. The place has a great vibe—open spaces, plenty of shaded spots, and a nice mix of greenery. I saw kids having fun at the playground, and some were even trying to fly kites, which added to the lively atmosphere.\n\nHalfway through, I stopped by the ice cream shop in the middle of the park and grabbed a sea salt cone. It was just the right treat to cool down after the run. The park is a great addition to the area—perfect for a casual day out or just to relax.",
