Muhammad Fahrurrazi Jumahat,1,"This clinic has a very rude Clinic Assistant. It was my first time here and she held my IC for a good 30 minutes but still got my name wrong on the medical cert and receipt. When I highlighted to her, she put the blame on me saying that I didn't checked it properly. Doctor was okay but the wait was rather long. I was the 6th patient but only managed to leave the clinic at 10am considering they are open by 8.30am.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115520984111385467199/reviews
Joshua Chua,5,"It is sad and disappointed to know that the clinic is no longer operate during night from 7pm to 9pm. For people like us who can only visit the clinic after the office hour, this changes is definitely affect us greatly.

Hence, for the sake of those working people who are your patients for many years, I sincerely hope doctor can consider perhaps to operate one or two nights in the week to accommodate those only can visit the clinic at night.

Thank You",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112412902052163459572/reviews
mazikeen x,1,"The doctor is amazing, always have been since i was young but the receptionists are just horrible. They talk bad about patients right in front of us as if we can’t hear them. Imo just come for the doctor and ignore the receptionists unless you’re looking to pick a fight that day.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101712872950150393442/reviews
Nur Alisha,1,"I arrived 4 minutes late and didn't realize registration closed at 12pm. I had an emergency with a patient experiencing an allergic reaction. Now I have to find another clinic.

En Tan,4,"End of the day, the most important thing is that the doctor is good and gives proper medication. They are affordable as well.

They get crowded quickly, so go early to avoid waiting too long. Doctor takes time to check and discuss your health issue, which also means the wait can be long.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111168954088066621633/reviews
