      "text": "Came by on New Yearâ€™s Day for lunch with our dog after making a reservation. Upon arrival, we waited outside while the staffâ€”busy wiping cutlery for a restaurant that was, at best, 30% filledâ€”did his best to ignore us.\n\nAfter signalling to him twice, he finally responded and got another colleague to show us to our seat.\n\nAs the place is pet-friendly (with a reservation option to indicate if youâ€™re bringing a dog), I was surprised to be shown to a high table, even though the al fresco area was, at best- less than 30% filled. After requesting couch seating, they accommodated my request but reminded me that pets arenâ€™t allowed on the couchâ€”fair enough.\n\nThe food's flavors were on pointâ€”very good overall, except for the steak, which was cooked medium well instead of the medium rare we ordered. When requesting payment, I asked for the rest of my burrito to be packed. However, it wasnâ€™t delivered back to our table. My companion thought the restaurant might be busy, but after noticing the chef out chatting and snacking, I decided to check in with the staff on our way out. I approached the very same staff member who is still dedicated to wiping the cutleries and discovered my food sitting forgotten on the bar counter.\n\nThroughout the meal, no one checked in on our dining experience or asked about the food. While this particular outlet was disappointing in terms of service, I appreciate the flavors and the good reviews of other locations. Iâ€™ll likely give another outlet a try next time instead.",

All of us ordered the tacos, beef and chicken.\n\nI must say that this is one of the better tacos I have had. Beef were well marinaded, flavourful and tender. The avocado is generous, and topped with diced tomatoes and onions, yums! The wrap is chewy and not overly dry. The way I like.\n\nService is fast, and atmosphere is quiet and chill for a workday lunch.",
