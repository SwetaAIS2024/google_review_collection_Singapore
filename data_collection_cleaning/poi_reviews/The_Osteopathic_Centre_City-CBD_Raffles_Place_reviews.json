      "text": "I am a professional tennis player and have worked with many therapists around the world.  I have struggled to find a fitting osteopath to work with since my previous practitioner left Singapore during Covid.\n\nThat is, until I met Irqa.\n\nThere are some clinicians who can be technical in their work, and others who do magic. Irqa is a miracle worker and every session with her unlocks a deeper level of healing, and subsequently performance in my body. I think most impressively, was an injury I was working through. I  was so sore, I couldn't even lift a car boot! Irqa worked her magic on me and in three weeks, I was able reach the finals of the nationals, and most importantly, play pain free.\n\nI could not recommend her enough.\n\nP.S. I also appreciate how cost efficient and simple the clinic is. No frills, just pure, straight up treatment.",

These ladies  brought their individual skill set to help me with my neck issues, working tirelessly week after week and I certainly can feel a big improvement. Iâ€™m so grateful for them. Thank you for your healing touch.",

Iqra worked wonders in just two sessions. Her expertise and gentle approach made a world of difference, and I left feeling so much better. The care and attention I received were exceptional. If you're struggling with any kind of pain, I highly recommend booking an appointment with Iqra.",

Not only did she accurately diagnose the problem but her treatment plan was effective and tailored to my needs. After a few sessions, I felt significant improvement in mobility and pain relief and very happy to be able to squat again!",
