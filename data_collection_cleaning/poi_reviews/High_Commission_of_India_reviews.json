      "text": "It is a pity when one's first impression of a place is marred by the security. I arrived early and checked again and again with security if I needed an appointment even to enter at 4.15 pm because I had been told I could walk in then but the guard insisted that I did. How strange I thought. Overall experience was very unpleasant. I understand you are doing your job, but still I don't think it is too much to ask to be pleasant. Gate was closed on us and paper for taking photo of link to make appointment was squeezed through the gate as we stood outside where it was too bright to see anything on a phone let alone take a photo. Seriously? I am hoping this message will be read by someone who will have a word with security and advise them to understand where others are coming from and treat others the way they wish to be treated. Not asking much here, just some basic human decency. Seek to understand. We returned at 420 pm and it was as I was told, we walked in along with others. Same security, letting people in. Did I miss something?!",

Security staff were polite and guided me to the proper counter and and explained that I need not take Q.no for life certificate attestation.\n2. The staff at the counter was also very helpful to our queries.\nSuggestion: Since the counters open at 9:30am, the security may start allowing the visitors from 8:30am into the compound, finish the checks, and provide some chairs to sit in the lawn area and cover the area with umbrella shelters. This will avoid people waiting on the road at the mercy of nature. If it rains, it will be a lot of trouble for the public.",
