      "text": "Good location, that's good and happy to find some food affordable in ecp area\n\nHowever the service was not good , no proper system for ordering and payment , people all wait near counter for their food to be ready .\n\nFood if u order like dosa Prata still ok.\n\nI ordered chicken Tikka masala and naans .\n\nSadly very poor. The masala is full of colors and I still can't get rid ree color after so many washes using soaps , never had this happened in SG. Surely above permitted level of colors . Super unhealthy and tasteless\n\nGarlic naan and cheese Naan feels like papadam just crispy not soft . No garlic or cheese .. probably worst naans tried in SG\n\nPrata and nasi goreng still ok .. drinks also fine .\n\nOverall not going back again .\n\nNo receipts so no transparency, be careful else end up pay more",

The only problem is the service, but it is no different in any KNS restaurant, you as along as you manage your own expectations, you will feel happy. It is a place to go as parking is easy, the crowd is not there.",

      "text": "Update: took this ball like thosai, simply love the taste and the slight crisp on the outside, softness within. I can never spell it but it was on one of food decal on the glass panel.\n\nThere is a lot of Indian food variety. The prata is quite good but not the maggi goreng.  The best food I loved is the briyani vegetarian set meal. The portion is too huge for 1 person, pair with a buddy and buy a chix as separate. The briyani rice itself is good to eat on its own. Though the vegetable dishes are different daily, I liked the fried cauliflower the best. I had this briyani veg rice set for few times and it never disappoints. Service staff are friendly. It can be quite packed during weekends but weekday is quite empty. You should also try the vadai with daal. One of my fav tea halia place.",

It wasnâ€™t crowded at all, but unfortunately, the staff forgot our order.\n\nThankfully, the food was ok and made up for the wait.\n\nPrice was above average but made sense because of the location.",
