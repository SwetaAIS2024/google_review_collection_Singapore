Yourtie Sun,5,"Been going here for 1year plus.. we bought goldfish, catfish and aro there.. been a place to go to buy feeder fish and prawn... the staff are all friendly. We even knew all the staff names.  They even can recognise our names when we call in to ask if there is any prawn/ fish. Hao and ken been a good help to also tell us tips to take care of our fishes and if the fishes there is a good fit for my tank..

All this fishes we bought is from THAT Aquarium tampines. We bought it from small and look how healthy the fishes  NOW! ☺️",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116674911833344509413/reviews
Gan Da,4,I don’t think they pay the best attention to their fishes health as it’s common to see dead fishes still in the tank. But definitely one of the best varieties available. Prices are decent too!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105290130871409009167/reviews

Lynxly,5,"Definitely one of the best - if not the best aquarium/fish shop in the east! Went there this afternoon to buy the tank set for $32 since I signed up as a member, and there was a huge variety of fishes and other marine life. Many different kinds of food, tanks, and pumps/filters available!  Staff were laid back and friendly, and assisted us in signing up to be a member for cheaper prices. Will definitely go there again if I need anything for my terrapin and betta.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117609101297955639696/reviews
Wilson T,2,Come here often. But the fish i buy from here seldom survive. Just recently got 14 fishes from here and now left with 2. All my other fish of the same species from elsewhere still thriving for more than 1 year. They sometimes have unique fish so I enjoy going there to check them out. But the fish health isn't the best. Maybe want to change supplier or learn to take care of fish better.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100763716261886408491/reviews
