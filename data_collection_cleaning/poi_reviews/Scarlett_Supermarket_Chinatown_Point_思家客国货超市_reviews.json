      "text": "Scarlett Supermarket offered a lot of products range from snacks, chocolates, biscuits, instant noodles, sweets, seasoning, choices of beverages, canned products, even watches, local souvenirs like bag, keychains, etc. If you were looking for China made foods and snacks, this store would be a good place. Tourists might also look for cheap yet good quality souvenirs to bring back home at this store. Goods were offered at reasonable pricing.\n\nThe store's floor space wss  not that big but it was quite comfortable for fast shopping. The payment could be made by cash and electronic modes. They provided free plastic bags for customers. Location wss easy to be accessed. From the MRT Chinatown exit, visitors might just walk straight to Chinatown Point on the left hand side of the same floor.",

It has affordable alcohol, chips, instant noodles and fans of Hadilao will find many many more flavours that’s not available locally.\n\nThe only challenge is the language. I wished it had more English write up so that you know what you are eating - or want to eat.",

      "text": "This supermarket was bigger than the other branches I had been to. There's a very clever optical illusion/trick that they did up, which was to put a big mirror at the back of the supermarket. It makes it look as if the supermarket is twice the original size.\n\nThere was a large variety of food and brands. Some had a one for one sale too. It was pretty crowded when we went there. The queue to pay can be quite long because there are only around 7 counters.\n\nWhile I was there, I happened to see something that made my hair stand on end (). I happened to look up and saw a rat (not a mouse okay, it was a big rat) scurrying happily across the ceiling beams. Dust came flying down and I was temporarily traumatised.",

This has a range quite similar to the flagship and original stores, less the fresh produce.\n\nSimilar to the Bedok outlet, this outlet has the mix and match section which is great for those who don’t wish to commit to consumer a box of snacks they have not tried before.",
