I knew the next patient had appointment time after mine because I was there earlier than her and overheard her conversation with receptionist when she arrived.  The receptionist then let the patient go in to see the doctor before me.  When I questioned the receptionist about it, she claims it was because it’s doctor’s policy to always serve patient that is early for appointment rather than admitting she made a mistake n apologise.\n\nI waited till 1125am to see the doctor eventually.  When I question doctor when I went in for my appointment, again the doctor evaded my question on his weird policy and says he would investigate.  I decided to give the doctor a chance since he claim he would investigate but I have yet to hear back from the clinic.\n\nThis shows a lack of integrity and accountability to their patients and how the entire medical profession seem to expect all patients to just wait however long it takes.  They put their own profits and benefits ahead of patient’s time.  It is a very disappointing experience for me at this clinic.",
