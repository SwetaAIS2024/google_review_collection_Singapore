We eat less spice and prefer more lighter preparations and she makes food super tasty with these constraints at hand. I have catered from her small dishes sometimes but also food catering for party and the quality is not compromised at all! She will be my go to person from now on!",

She truly puts a lot of effort and makes sure the food is customised to our taste. She’s also the reason why we have managed to actually stay on course with our fitness as we don’t crave restaurant food at all and are more than content with the homemade food delivered!!",

She cooks fresh food and the food tastes so good.\nI have had the fortune to eat food cooked by her even as a friend and I'm glad she's into the catering business and it's a blessing for so many people. We had ordered for our festive parties as well from her.  She uses the best ingredients and her kitchen is super clean, she practices excellent hygiene standards.\nThe food is packed so well. Fresh and steaming hot. Snacks are perfect. Her Dhoklas soft and spongy, Dahi vadas melt in the mouth, khandvi, samosas all so good. You can order online via Urban tummy or can order via Grab food as well.\nMust Try Swati's Recipes.",

The food is made fresh, tastes absolutely delicious and is always delivered on time.\nSpecial mentions to Navratna daal, palak paneer, kadhai paneer, aloo gobhi. Among the snacks, samosas and vada pav were excellent.  Laddoos and shakar para were lovely too. For home food that is fresh,  tasty and good portion size, highly recommend Swati's Recipes !",
