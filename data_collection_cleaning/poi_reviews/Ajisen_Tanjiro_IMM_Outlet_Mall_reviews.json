See pictures taken. Never have I had squid of this nature. Looks, feels, and tastes fake.\n\nThe fried chicken was soft and slimy. Some parts are okay, but some parts are feels weird eating it. See picture taken. Simple fried chicken, yet it doesn’t taste and feel right.\n\nUsed to patronise Ajisen here in IMM before the renovation. But now, it is far from decent food expectations.",

      "text": "On a busy Friday night, we chanced upon this restaurant that was fairly empty and decided to give it a shot\n\nService was rather slow and the website crashed while we were trying to place an order, appreciate the staff for finally helping to place the order manually\n\nFood took about 25 mins to arrive which was borderline too long for us…but it’s okay maybe Friday night things\n\nWe ordered 5 pcs of regular gyoza, 5 pcs of crispy gyoza, pork chop maze soba, chicken cutlet maze soba\n\nGyoza was pretty good and fit the price, but we were really disappointed with the maze soba that were clumped together, with small portion sizes. Pork chop was overcooked, resulting in a very tough texture. Chicken was nothing to shout about but honestly we were pretty sad about the meal\n\nTable beside us was getting grumpy about the food coming out slow as they waited for about 30 minutes\n\nUnlikely to return :(",

      "text": "During my visit to Ajisen Ramen at IMM Outlet Mall, I found the overall experience to be satisfactory. While the service was acceptable, there is room for improvement as it did not stand out. Despite varying reviews, I personally found the ramen I ordered to be tasty and satisfying. The price point for the weekday set lunch, coupled with the available promo, was reasonable. The ambience of the restaurant was okay.\n\nAlthough Ajisen Ramen may not offer the best ramen I have ever tasted, taking into account the price point, service, and ambience, I believe it deserves a 4-star rating. The combination of tasty dishes, reasonable pricing, and acceptable service makes it a commendable choice for a casual dining experience.",
