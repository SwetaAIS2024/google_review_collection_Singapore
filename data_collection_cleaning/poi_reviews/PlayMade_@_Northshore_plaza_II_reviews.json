      "text": "Was there on Sunday, waited for more than 30mins as the staff go for toilet break. Understandable as only 1 staff is working on a busy Sunday evening. Somehow, her attitude is not acceptable. No greeting like other outlets never mind. I asked if she accepted cash. As I'm afraid it is a cashless payment mode. Here is the reply from her, “how much u gonna pay?” I haven't even ordered and I don't even know how much my orders cost. Followed by, a frustrating mood if you going to pay $50 I have no changes for you-.-! Then I said okay, I can pay by paywave or smaller changes. She then *rolled her eyes*! Omg! This kind of service can meh? After that, I tried to order, and she replied wait! I still have an order that needs to be keyed in. Jolly Well has to wait right? She takes her own sweet time to key in all the orders-.- while my kids and I discuss what to order. She said again! Wait! I got orders-.-! Hello! I'm just discussing with my kids not ordering. Does she need to be so frustrated? Worst experience.",
