But I think their skin it’s a little bit too thick for the kueh, probably need to hold the amount of bamboo shoots. As for the Black Kueh, it’s black sesame sweet filling inside. Both kueh I tried are decent and although the skin is thick, it’s enjoyable chewy at the same time. You may wan to try their mini version for tasting.",
