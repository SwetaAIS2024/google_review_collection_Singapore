For public dishes expect a 20-40% difference in prices.\n\nFood was good and even with the difference, cheaper than inside the main airport. So if you are on a tight budget, itâ€™s a good place to go.\n\nReally clean and quiet  when we went. There is a bar if you want to grab a drink. To get there walk to the end of Terminal 1 and follow the signs to Car Park 2. Once in the car park take the lifts to level 2.",

This canteen serves Changi employees and army staff because there's a military base nearby. I've been coming to this food court for over a decade, whenever I can clear Customs during stopovers at Changi Airport, and it has excellent hawker food if that's what you're after!",

For 2 decades or more, this pakcik often sells out after lunch.\n.\nHe fries each order individually, so there's usually a queue waiting patiently.\n.\nThe soft chewy yellow noodles carry a smoky savoury salty spice flavour, conrrasted by crisp bean sprouts and juicy cucumbers, both lending a vegetal sweet flavour. Bits of wispy whisked chicken egg lend a slight eggy sweet savoury note.\n.\nYou can opt to add several ingredients, which most do - from springy fish cake, tender boiled potatoes, soft overeasy chicken egg, to crispy battered chicken cutlet.",
