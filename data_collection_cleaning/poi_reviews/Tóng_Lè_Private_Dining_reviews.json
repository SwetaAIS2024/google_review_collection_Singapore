      "text": "The breathtaking panoramic views from Tóng Lè Private Dining, situated on the 10th floor of OUE Tower, are undeniable, particularly the night view of Marina Bay. As a revolving waterfront restaurant, the experience is memorable. However, the 'Sawn' set menu at SGD 198++ per person didn't quite meet expectations in terms of food quality. The lobster salad was a standout dish, but other courses were average. Service was also a concern, as it was challenging to find staff when needed.\"",

The restaurant overlooks the Marina Bay Sands and the Central Business District and provides stunning sunset and night view. Environment is not noisy and conclusive to have a nice chat with friend.\n\nService is top notch with staff making sure that we are well taken care of. We ordered the Dawn set dinner and portion is just right and delicious.\n\nOverall, it was pleasant dining experience, whether it is the environment, food or service provided, it deserves a 5-star rating.",
