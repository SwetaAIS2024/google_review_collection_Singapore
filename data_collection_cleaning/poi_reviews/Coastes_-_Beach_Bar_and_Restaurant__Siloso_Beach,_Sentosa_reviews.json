Always enjoyed the  perfectly made calamari combined with the chilli crab dip every trip. Big portions, free drinking water & great view. The staffs are polite and helpful. Self service ordering and pay at counter before they serve the food. Wide variety of drinks but no beer for this trip. Trying not to get drunk on a weekday.",

I replied, I can finish my drinks first since just a bit remaining. Then, he suddenly proceed to tell me rudely, \"need to pay sgd30 per person to stay\". And I confirm with other girl staff. And asked, if that fee is for staying only or consumable for food purchase. And she just nod, like no mood to talk more. I know they are looking down at us. Like we are not capable to pay it, so no need to answer our questions properly. They just entertain nicely those western customers.",

The girl that came to our table to take our order instead of us having to order via a QR code was really nice and she was very helpful in helping us order some of our items. The food came quickly, though it wasn't that busy at that time but it was still nice and it was very tasty. It is very nice and relaxing sitting there looking out across the beach while you eat even though the weather wasn't that great today. It is a little on the expensive side but all up it was very good. Highly recommended.",
