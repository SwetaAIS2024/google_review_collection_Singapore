Sharon Michelle,5,An amazing school. Never had even one thing to complain about since my kids started with them. Every teacher would go all out for the children. My only regret was withdrawing my child from this school since we have to move. Love everything about this school. ❤️,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101427310967019372907/reviews
