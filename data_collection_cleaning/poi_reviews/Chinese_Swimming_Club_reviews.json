A special shout-out goes to Edmund Lee and Andy Lam, whose outstanding assistance made the event a success. From the setup to accommodating special requests and providing excellent banquet support on the day itself, their hospitality was truly exceptional. The service was fast, efficient, and they went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. The food was delicious, with generous portions and a wide range of options to choose from. I highly recommend their services and look forward to working with them again!",

And not forgetting the swim there, big and small pool available, adults can also book the badminton court there for a game or two and bowling available. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed our half a day there at CSC üëçüèª",

The ballroom was wonderful but I understand it is about to go through renovation. Ample parking lots available here always a huge plus.",

Unchewable bits in every bite.  Struggled to finish.  Jaw marathon through 200g.\n\nExtremely crowded.  Busier than public  community centres.  Couldn't get a parking spot.  Had to queue for table.",
