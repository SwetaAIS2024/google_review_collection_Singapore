But due to most of store owner is elderly their daily operating is not consistent that need to be noted. Respect them in maintaining good food at a reasonable price. They deserve the rest.",

One of my personal favorites is the Mee Hoon â€“ it's always cooked to perfection with the right balance of flavors. The Nasi Lemak stalls are also worth a mention, consistently serving up delicious and satisfying meals. Prices are very reasonable, making it a great spot for affordable and tasty dining.\n\nThe food centre is clean and well-maintained, typical of a good hawker centre, yet it still retains a friendly, neighborhood vibe.",
