Belvern Tan T S,1,"On 3rd August 2022 (1127hrs), I had a very seriously bad experience with one of the Indian security man who is extremely rude and notorious. I was delivering to the warehouse as I told him and without a simple basic manners as a security, he replied very rudely that the warehouse is closed at 1130am to 1pm for lunch. But I told him nicely that already arrange with the staff Ms Tan Chin Fang and the warehouse staff. But he ignore me n ordered me to come back at 1pm which is really unreasonable as I came all the way to Tuas for the delivery. He even challenge me and ask me to get out of the gate even after the delivery which was conducted only when Ma Tan Chin Fang came and assist. He was also very rude to Ms Tan Chin Fang. As I can see Ms Tan Chin Fang was shocked n frighten by his indecent attitude. Kindly will the Management of Abbvie do something about it as it will be a very bad reputation for AbbVie to have such notorious security guards. I Belvern Tan driver will urge this complaint seriously to the right authority of AbbVie guardhouse at 23 Tuas South Avenue 6. Appreciate if you can look into this matter very seriously.
