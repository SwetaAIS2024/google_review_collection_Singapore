Cheiko's Channel,5,"This place is very good to visit and it is very quiet. In the early morning and in the evening you can come here for biking, jogging or just relaxing walks. There is also a canal connecting from the Kalang river, where you can fish and see the wildlife found in this river such as herons, storks and if you are lucky you will see a family of wild otters looking for fish in the canal.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104291754801058938647/reviews
