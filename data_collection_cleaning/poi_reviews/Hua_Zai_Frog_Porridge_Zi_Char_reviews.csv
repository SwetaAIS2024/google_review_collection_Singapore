J T (MeJTime),4,"The frog meat is tender, while the gooey porridge is best drenched with the spicy black sauce from the 宫保田鸡 (𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐠 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐃𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐢), making it smooth and creamy. There is also a non-spicy version, 姜葱田鸡 (𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐠 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐒𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐎𝐧𝐢𝐨𝐧), good for the kids!

Emily Lim,5,"We choose Gong bao flavour frog porridge
and order 1 small baby kailan for sides.

I love that the porridge is thick and still can taste the rice texture.
The porridge is still thick despite we eating super slow, haha! It didn't turn watery.

The main - gong bao sauce with 3 frogs.
The sauce is not salty at all, but it is still very flavourful! It's not very spicy and you can choose a different level of spiciness!
Perfect if you have young kids! The frog meat is tender and has no fishy taste. There is an extra spicy level if you want to try!
The sauce selection: frog with spring onion, with dried chilli, with dried chilli extra spicy.

Some other unique flavour: salt and pepper, salted egg, chicken essence!

If you don't like porridge, you can also opt for white rice!

The portion of the porridge is huge for 2 person! It's best to eat at the stall! Piping hot and shiok!!! Overall happy tummy! 😊",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101517886044595109039/reviews
Felicia Seet,5,"Had their frog porridge on a cool rainy day and it was the best way to keep warm. The thick porridge mixed with the fragrant sauce of the Claypot Kung Po Chilli Frog legs goes perfectly well together.

Sauce is thick, savory and full of umami with just the right amount of spice. It’s one of the best combo in my opinion but you can also opt for the non spicy choice.

Ordered an additional Sweet and Sour Fish for the kids and it was also quite crisp and delicious.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114471626032284546245/reviews
