Leigh Gorospe,1,"I am very disappointed , we came here with my partner and it takes so long the order , not much customers but why they missed our orders. It took 25 mints to wait.  When I asked the counter where is our order ...and the guy was surprised.  And ask the malay lady.. what is our order. As a customer they must be aware and  attentive to all customers.. Please inform them be more attentive and don't give excuses that they throw the receipt.  It's not acceptable as a customer.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107915517127080528136/reviews
Matthew Tan,5,"Apart from the usual expectations of a Starbucks outlet, I will describe this outlet as quaint and laid back with friendly staff, certainly a nice place to chill over breakfast on a Saturday morning. Interior decor is simple, nothing spectacular likely due to its neighborhood location.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105755998562028556886/reviews
Dhananjay Garg,5,"An excellent place to catch up with friends over a coffee and some light desserts. It is a quiet place with minimal crowd as the area is mostly less crowded. The baristas are helpful and maintain a pretty calm demeanor towards the guests. I can spend time in meetings and discussions, too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105192542383225533490/reviews
Jasmin Pek,5,"Visited this outlet 3rd time and sad to say that I sympathise with the staff here. Only one staff to handle the ordering, prepare the drinks and clear the tables.  This is too stressful for them. Hope Starbucks could improve and add on at least another staff at this outlet to help out the poor guy out.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109023308335236001934/reviews
Abraham Lee,4,Pretty consistent offering with other Starbucks. I like this outlet for its location and pretty spacious seating. Itâ€™s also not as crowded as other Starbucks. This outlet has a massively powerful Aircon which is great.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
