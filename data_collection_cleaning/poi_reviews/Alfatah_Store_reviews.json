      "text": "Located at 161 Bukit Batok Street 11, in the middle of St Luke's Hospital and Bukit Batok West Shopping Mall. You can take buses 990 or 187 to get here and walk about 5 to 10 mins.\n\nThey are a convenient store located under a HDB estate which locals call it a mama shop. It's somewhat a mini 7-Eleven. They operate as a Shopee collection point for your parcels and unless you stay around their neighborhood, I would highly recommend to not choose your pick up point to be here. There are other simpler and easier pick up locations by automated machines from Pick Lockers or PopStations which are accessible 24hrs. The people in this store aren't the most efficient and they do prioritize their business selling stuff than helping you to get your parcel when you personally head over for collection. Most important factor is their operational hours aren't fixed and it would be frustrating if they aren't open.",
