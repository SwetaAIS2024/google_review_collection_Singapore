Popeye The baby,1,This is the 2nd time I've ordered from this branch and I'm utterly disappointed. The first time I ordered the cup corn and it was sourish (after which I had food poisoning) and today the kani mayo sushi turned bad... I won't order from them ever again,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100946084676459140433/reviews
Cher Lyn,2,service staff were nice but the sushi is terrible.... the rice is so soggy it's like the wet glue used for craft..... not worth the price for a convenient sushi takeout,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101440424825207886048/reviews
