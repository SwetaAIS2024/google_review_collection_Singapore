Adam Gazari,4,"The Nasi Rawon is a delightful fusion of flavors that perfectly showcases the depth of Javanese cuisine. The tender pieces of beef, steeped in a rich, black keluak broth, are incredibly flavorful and melt in your mouth. The fragrant rice serves as a perfect base, soaking up the savory, slightly tangy broth. Each bite is an explosion of spices balanced with subtle sweetness from the serundeng (fried coconut flakes) and the fresh crunch of vegetables. The accompanying sambal adds just the right amount of heat, while the tempeh, tofu, and half-boiled egg round off the meal, offering a variety of textures and tastes. It‚Äôs a hearty and satisfying dish that truly captures the essence of traditional Southeast Asian comfort food. Highly recommended for anyone craving a bold, comforting, and authentic taste of Indonesia!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100331608463018382443/reviews
