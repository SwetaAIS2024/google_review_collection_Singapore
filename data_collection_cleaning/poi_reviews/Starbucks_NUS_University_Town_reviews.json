The atmosphere is great, with a pretty view of utown green, is very spacious, and has many comfortable and clean tables of different types. Perfect for someone to both spend time with friends as well as come to study! Has many plugs in case you need to recharge your devices. Would for sure recommend to come.",

They would chope seats, and attend classes elsewhere.\n\nPeople who genuinely want to sit and work do not get spaces. It is very annoying that such people with such mentality exist and staff is unable to manage them.",

And if you are planning to study here during exam period, do try to come early as the place will be swarmed by students!",

      "text": "The best place to hangout in NUS, especially after the latest renovation. Another addition to the limited edition Starbucks nitro cold brew at this outlet. Very sure to meet friends and mutual friends (if you are a student) when you are hanging around this area. Aircon and non-aircon areas for studying and just relaxing. Expect students to just simply “reserve” their seats by placing their bags/books/papers on the table nearing the exam period. But do not be shy to chuck them aside if you are sure that they have been gone for more than half an hour (although the official time is only 15mins). It will be fully packed during exam periods so you will need to go earlier to get a seat. The best part is that this place is open 24H during the school term and it’s just perfect to hang till late, especially for students staying in halls. Loads of power points here, unlike how stingy it can be at the Starbucks outlets off campus, and the staff here are generally nice.",
