Fairy,4,"The stir-fried cabbage with pork was well-seasoned. I requested no MSG, and it was prepared just as I liked: quite spicy, not too salty, and not oily. Iâ€™ll return to try other dishes.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110707374703256523409/reviews
daishukiy,5,"I've been a frequent customer for this specific chinese restaurant, the chef was so nice to cook me my favourite dish of their previous å¹²ç…¸è‚¥è‚  ( now they change into a different menu as they are launching like a new $8+ dish) Their potato and eggplant i believe is nice also!

This shop never disappoints with their dishes tbh, a bit pricy but honestly worth it to support ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I hope they'll open for a long time and that theres constant customer to support!

They dont open 24/7 but i vaguely remember they told me they open basically everyday ( best to confirm again) Their worker also quite nice and friendly.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104795644302402786924/reviews

Joey C.,5,"Mala! I think this hawker might have another location somewhere else. Whatever they are doing , they are doing well. One of my favorite dishes whenever I go to a mala place is to try their tomato egg dish (haha I know itâ€™s lame) cause I like the simplicity of the dish. Well they did that great and also this pork with quail egg, so fatty and heavenly melt in your mouth haha. They have all your favorite mala dishes (see the photo). I plan to try their other dishes but the if the ones we tried are any indication it will be the bomb ðŸ˜‹!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117248916812976885999/reviews
