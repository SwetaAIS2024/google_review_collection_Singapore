However, my 4 kids still love them, as my kids can feel that teachers genuinely care for them. Also, the lessons r ALWAYS fun and engaging.\n\nTeachers are responsive, and often give insightful feedback to parents to aid developing each unique kid to their fullness potential.\n\nCouldn't have ask for a better school for my kiddos. Thank you Teacher Su, Teacher Mel and all the other BB teachers for the past 6 years of partnership!",

Effective communication and easy atmosphere has brought many families back, from early learning childcare, to tuition. We have always enjoyed the personal care and guidance from the teachers. Such great memories. Do check out the centre if you like a smaller personal childcare kindergarten.",

The centre has a very warm family environment and it revolves around a culture of care for the children. They provide regular updates on my son’s progress and the activities that he took part in during the day.\n\nI have seen an exceptional amount of progress in my son’s learning. He was a timid boy in the beginning but his teachers opened up the world for him to learn. His speech improved dramatically, became more creative, confident and has a greater understanding of the world.\n\nIt is indeed a bright beginning!",
