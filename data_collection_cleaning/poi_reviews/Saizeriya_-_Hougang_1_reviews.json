We normally will order focaccia bread, soup, some of the pastas which my children love it, grill pepper chicken, lala, etc...Those are the only things that are worth it....wait time was also reasonable. Definitely not the best but the price you paid is reasonable.",

      "text": "Taste is definitely not at the top of oneâ€™s mind when going to Saizeriya, but the place certainly serves value-for-money pizzas and pastas.\n\nDeviated from our usual Hougang Mall outlet to this one at Hougang 1 instead. Queues are definitely shorter here, but manpower seems very stretched here. Made the mistake of ordering deserts to be served later, and had difficulty getting help to serve them. However, kitchen was churning out food at great speed despite the place being nearly full - kudos to the system they have going on.",

Their grilled items and appetisers are tasty too. We love their foccacia, but skip the desserts - don't ask why.\n\nIt's actually value for money considering you get a meal that's better than hawker/food court standard at much less than restaurant pricing.",
