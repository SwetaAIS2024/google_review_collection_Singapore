Kaye Sanchez,5,"It is one of the best team building experiences! Regardless of our team having a few number of people, 7 of us exactly, it was fun with all of the activities organized. We booked the gardens by the bay activity and participated in the evening. Post videos and photos are hilarious.  Definitely will recommend it to a bigger group!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112426960938979395949/reviews
Celine Le Cotonnec,5,"We had an amazing team-building experience playing together on a very well-designed game. It brought colleagues from all over the world together, helping us quickly bond and develop strategies to work better as a team. Bertrand was incredibly flexible — we had originally planned an outdoor activity, but due to unexpected weather, he adapted quickly and seamlessly. I highly recommend the team for any team-building activities you’re considering!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104788573204193178055/reviews
x,5,"Our company got SingExperience for our ~50pax team bonding (we chose Bank Escape). Event was a massive success with many participants enjoying themselves and giving great reviews! Thank you Bertrand and Vince for guiding us ☺️

We had to change our event dates multiple times but SingExperience was still very kind and accommodating to us. Many thanks to Lovely, who was prompt in her replies and coordination with us ☺️

Highly recommended!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103497553943554272025/reviews
