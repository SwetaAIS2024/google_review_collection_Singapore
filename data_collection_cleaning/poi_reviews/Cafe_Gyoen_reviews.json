Liked the presentation or else if mixed together it become a donburiüòÜ but the taste of each portion on the plate taken on its own is tasty.\nDecor on the wall is bare minimum however corridor outside the toilet is unique it‚Äôs like a train üöä cabin",

It will definitely fill your tummy, all the little sides just add up so well together.\n\nThe waffle is crispy and fluffy inside, it has a little citrusy flavour in it, making it a good dessert after a heavy meal.\n\nWill definitely be back for more",

      "text": "Guess Serangoon always have many good foodie places just that parking is always a hassle even when u go early. Was here at 1040am for early brunch (sat) and have to wait a while to get carpark (but when I left at 1145am seems like the breakfast crowd leaving). Food presentation is good and food taste good as well, just that the portion is a little small for me and ended up have to order more. Spent about $80+ when usually only costs $50+ for 3 of us (two adults and one child). Think everything is good just the portion and the parking (for those far away), if u live near I think no problem. Deco quite nice but also have sparse empty walls (which was a pity).",

      "text": "We visited Cafe Gyoen on a weekday for lunch and the place was cozy and bustling. Despite the crowd, the food arrived promptly with minimal waiting time. We opted for their teishoku, which was not only visually appealing with its adorable little dish plates but also incredibly appetizing. Each dish was packed with flavor and exceeded our expectations!\n\nWe made sure to leave room for their waffle, which was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I highly recommend pairing it with their yuzu and matcha ice cream, both tasted exceptionally rich and creamy!\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our visit and their portions were generous without any hint of compromise for quality. We‚Äôll definitely be returning to explore more of their menu!",
