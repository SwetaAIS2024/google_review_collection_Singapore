J Siow,2,"Thosai and dal gravy were fine but nothing extraordinary. Had to ask for bread to go with mutton soup. Unfortunately the mutton soup was less than satisfactory,  as it was mostly all soup with a few miserable small pieces of meat. Can improve on process of order and pay management as it was unruly with more customers.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110015603970905830819/reviews
