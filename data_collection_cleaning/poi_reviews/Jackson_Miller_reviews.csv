Ashley Liew,5,"Been coming to Jackson Miller at Singapore Swimming Club for special occasions since I was a kid, and have good memories with my parents here especially my late mother who enjoyed the Western food here. This remains a lovely restaurant for food and dining. The beef as part of the set dinner was especially sumptuous last night. The service is always excellent here, and so is the wine. Thank you for making our celebration night yesterday a wonderful one üôèüèª",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Eileen Wee,5,"Serves fairly standard high end fare executed well. The 4 star rating for food was to recognise that whilst food was good , it was not creative but is at a price point where one might have higher expectations. Service is excellent and atmosphere is adequate.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115629808604054379359/reviews
Anurag Srivastava,4,"Outstanding service, great food and good wine selection. We took the dinner set and it was more than filling. The dessert was not the best though and hence not giving it 5 stars. The US oysters were good as well at 30 per half doz. Overall great place for a nice fine dining meal.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110828282648042584315/reviews
John Tango,3,"Date of visit. Saturday April 17th 2021 for dinner.

The service was relatively good. 9/10

Assorted bread rolls (rasin, plain white, walnut grain) with butter was good. 9/10.

Mushroom soup was good, 9/10.

Escargots was lacking in garlic and so was the toasted garlic bread. Add more garlic and it should be perfect. Rating 7/10.

The Tomahawk steak 1.4kg was a tad too tough - too chewy. The mushroom, kale and small whole potatoes were very good. Overal it did not impress. Do not think we will order this again. Tasted better ones else where. Rating 7/10 at best.

The Prime Roasted beef was better, soften than the tomahawk. However still too chewy. 7/10 rating at best.  The days of The Harbour Grill (predecessor to Jackson Miller) roasted prime rib was much better.

Sides : Caesar salad was so-so 6/10. Corn on the cob 9/10.  Asparagus was okay 7/10 rating.

Appetizers : French oysters 7/10. We prefer the Canadian or Japanese ones that are fuller & creamery. So 7/10 rating.

One critical feedback, the waitress in black suit Ms Tran packed the left over steak as requested and retrieve the remaining bread rolls (2 of 3) saying no take aways and apparently to be ‚Äòrecycled‚Äô into the bread roll plastic bin. That is a hygiene issue especially during this on going pandemic. The club need to explain this odd service. What is wrong having to pack 2 remaining bread rolls (1 was consumed) that was served already, exposed for a good 45 mins though partially wrapped in cloth towel. Strange.

Another odd observation. Ms Tran upon receiving the oysters from the kitchen proper, started shifting the oysters with her bare fingers to make room to place the two dips on the bowl of ice along side the oysters. Perhaps to save an additional trip to our table? SMH.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117082529878868496412/reviews
Ronald Hee,5,"Impeccable service. A step back in time, to when you dressed up for meals, yes they have a dress code. Food was very good. Don't think I'll be back though as I'm not a member!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108882484691409740583/reviews
