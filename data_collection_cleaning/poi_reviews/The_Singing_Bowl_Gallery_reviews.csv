Flo G,5,"Located in an office building, the Singing Bowl Gallery offers sound bath sessions, workshops and sale of singing bowls etc. A clean, safe & serene environment especially on weekends when building is empty. Professional teachers and staff: done Haruka and Maeâ€™s sound bath/meditation sessions and absolutely love the therapeutic effects. Highly recommend this place.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews
Halfeti Rose,5,"Me & friend attended our first breath work & sound session with Haruka last night. She plays the flute beautifully. It was a calming & peaceful session and the space was relaxing & cozy. Haruka's very friendly & approachable , she makes you feel so welcomed. Don't be surprised to find yourself falling asleep for awhile during her session ,that's normal and i meant in a good way :)  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to learn some breathing techniques and apply in your daily life.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118090628331455217636/reviews
