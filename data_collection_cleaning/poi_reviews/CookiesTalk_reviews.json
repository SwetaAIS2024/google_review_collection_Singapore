      "text": "This place is a trap!! Albeit in a good way. Haha. You will be pampered to the enormous variety of biscuits and crackers you can find here and at truly affordable prices (Yes they are cheaper than outside retail). Sometimes they carry specialty biscuits and its really nice. The lady (I think the lady boss?) is really friendly and helpful if you’re stuck on what to choose. Recently bought the salted egg roll and its super. Its 鸡丝咸豆沙饼 is really good too. I never leave this place empty handed cos it has everything (a kid to a adult) one loved to eat.",

Plus you can take time to have a look around the store for the prices.\nThe biscuits aren't prepacked, so you can have flexibility of buying just a tiny amount or a larger amount, all according to how much of the biscuits you want, they are then packed on the spot.",
