Vivian Yeo,4,Service is top notch. Generous to top up soup. My son n daughter love the taste of soup. You tiao is freshly fried. Ingredients are fresh too. Price is reasonably affordable.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102492585290902204833/reviews
Chelzia Ping,1,"Came for the 2nd time but the pig vinegar trotter is getting worst as there is no meat at all. Mostly 90% is bone, some with the skin and the jelly jelly things or we call it the fats?

We order a big pot for 2 pax. When we can't find any meat. We order one small pot asking for more meat and told the guy that we don't eat the skin and fat. End up the small pot only have 2pcs of meat 😅

Should have some meat for us who don't eat fats 😅

Never recommend. Not worth it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102842006654864340499/reviews
