      "text": "T-Junction staff are unfriendly. They did not let my bro play the Wii U even though he is already a student registered in the system. They never bothered to fix broken equipment or add more software for better enjoyment.\n\nFacilities are so limited that they always get overbooked. A lot of places there we cannot go to. Even though we are students they treat us like outsiders. Not enough charging sockets for me to charge my laptop. So disappointed in my own school for treating us like this (facepalms and shakes head disapprovingly). SG businesses really need to learn from the Japs who are more hospitable",
