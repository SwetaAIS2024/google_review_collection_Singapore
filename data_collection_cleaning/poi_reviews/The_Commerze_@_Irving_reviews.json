Situated within 3 mins walk to Tai Seng MRT, commuting is a breeze, ensuring seamless connectivity for employees and clients alike. With TOP in 2011, it remains clean and modern, the corridors are neat - suitable for business clientsâ€™ visits. What sets the light industrial units apart are those with north / south -facing orientation, allowing abundant natural light to flood the space, fostering a productive and vibrant work environment. You find a good mix of creative tenants from tailor, dance studio, to events company here.\nTenants appreciate the attached bathroom in every unit.",
