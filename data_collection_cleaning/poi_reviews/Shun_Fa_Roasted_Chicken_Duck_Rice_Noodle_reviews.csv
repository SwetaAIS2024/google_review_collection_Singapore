Wee Xiang Kun,5,"Ordered this roasted duck rice for $5. Taste is above average, maybe they can give duck meat that with skin. Feeling like eating normal duck instead of roast duck. But I really love their chicken rice tbh.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113392699261265732674/reviews

Zatarie Hoe,5,This plate only $4. If only normal chicken rice $3. Where to find this type of price. It‚Äôs cheap good and fast! Their duck noodle or kway teow also very nice. Definitely recommended. Locals would form a long queue during meal times but their service always very fast. Recommended :),2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115063186209477778569/reviews

Desmond Lim,5,"This is the BEST chicken rice I have tried in CCK area! Chicken is tender and cooked to the right texture, rice is very fragrance and not too oily with nice blend of garlic fragrance. The chicken rice is especially tasty when eaten with the well-loved self-made chilli sauce üëçüëçüëç The price is very reasonable at $2.80 only.. very honest and down-to-earth hawker preparing very tasty and affordable food for all! Highly recommended to all!!!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102400484891733905614/reviews
