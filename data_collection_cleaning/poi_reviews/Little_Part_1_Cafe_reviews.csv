Andy Chua,5,"Hidden away from the usual  buzzing, this is a nice place where you can chill with family and friends. Though the place maybe a bit small, and if you need a bigger venue, you can try the one at Sunse way which can hold a bigger group.

The place wide selection of nice food, good service, drinks, and a  comfortable atmosphere to  relax or wind down. If you are a stout lover,  I personally would recommend that you try the ""100 years"" that is a milk stout which is smooth and  creamy, it has coffee, chocolate notes which is something different from the normal stout.  If you ou happen to be around, do give it a try.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110739422020409270733/reviews
Cyndi Poh,5,Charming little cafe on the far end of Blair road on the corner. Quite an extensive menu. Latte was nice. Service was great and friendly. Love the vibe. Insta worthy. Read that they actually have quite a long history but shifted location over the years. Will be back to try their other stuff.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117806932922343587190/reviews
Sam Liew,5,"I came here for a cup of flat white in late afternoon while waiting to go for my next appointment.
The coffee has a rich aroma and a robust flavor, and I truly enjoyed the peaceful, inviting atmosphere in this small cafe.
I only wish the cafe provide small bite, cake or pastry to go with the coffee.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101928544135913893508/reviews
