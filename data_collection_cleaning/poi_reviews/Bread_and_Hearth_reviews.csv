Di Di,5,"The scent of nice, strong coffee attracted me to the place and the cappuccino did not fail me. The almond croissant was topped generously with almond and there was almond cream in the middle. I love the atmosphere, and will be back to try the mains one day.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews

MinGyeol Kim,4,"Whether it’s a cup of coffee, or a piece of cake, even a plate of fries, it’s a good idea to try any dish from Bread & Hearth once.

I normally eat the truffle fries, which may be a little pricey but then, the amount is matches the price.

Overall, it’s a pretty good place to eat, as it provides a good café atmosphere with dim lights",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106126571306122657934/reviews

HC L,3,First time trying. Ordered the egg mayonnaise sandwich. Didn’t really like the bread used nor the crackers served. Service was fast and friendly though. May try the avocado toast next time.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
