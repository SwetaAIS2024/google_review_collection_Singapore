      "text": "I stayed at Rucksack Inn at Temple Street for 15 days and I loved it. I enjoyed the atmosphere, helpful service, clean common area, and the constant cleaning of bathrooms. The rooms were a bit small but that didn't create any problems. Everyone over there was willing to help each other. The location is extremely good for tourists. However, the location is Chinatown so Halal food is a bit difficult to get but nearby 7-Elevens came in clutch for that. Loved everything about my stay. Will stay with them again in the future.",

The room was spotless, the bed was firm yet cozy, and everything worked perfectly—from the air conditioning to the Wi-Fi.\n\nCheck-in was quick, and the staff were friendly (Specially Ate Chris) and helpful from start to end.\n\nThis motel might not have luxury frills, but it delivers exactly what you need: a safe, clean, quiet place to rest—at a great price. I’d definitely stay here again.",

It is conveniently located in Chinatown, a haven for gastronomic adventure.\n\nI had stayed a room with two bunk beds with my friends.\nThe room had no windows but has good ventilation. There are individual lockers which you can tuck your important belongings.\n\nThe shower and bathroom are separate. The space is just enough to do your business.\nThe pantry and working lounge close to the reception is great. You can do some personal work there with an ease.\n\nThe surrounding area is safe at night and very close to MRT station.\nThe staffs are helpful and accommodating.\nOverall, a decent place to stay in Singapore.",
