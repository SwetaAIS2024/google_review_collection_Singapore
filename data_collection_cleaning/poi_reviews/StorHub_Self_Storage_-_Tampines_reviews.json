You can drive to their loading/unloading bay and unload using their trolleys and access to their lift via access code given to you. On the appropriate floors, you just need to find the room you rented and move all items yourself. The service staff mentioned customers can borrow ladders but I see none there. Will be good to place it at a common area at each floor for customers to borrow . Hope this info helps those renting self storage for the first time .",
