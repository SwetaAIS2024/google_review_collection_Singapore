Cloris Ng,4,Auntie Irene is a kind and helpful person. All of the nurses are polite and helpful. I just want to mention that an X-ray staff shouted at a lady who didn't understand English. Better care for the migrant workers—no shouting at patients. Do you think you know all the languages in the country?,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107619944964736439852/reviews
Nicholias Phoenix,1,"Registration is sooooo slow. Feels like a joke.

At this day and age, no IT Tools to register walk in like QR code registration.

Some of the patients here are just here to do simple screening.

Which can be automated without having to register manually.

With only 1 staff and long queue outside clinic.

Staff seems to be taking own sweet time to do other things. No sense of urgency.

Ridiculous clinic! Inefficiency to the max! Hope it shuts down.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116168246079897360880/reviews
Dionne MA,1,"Went to see doctor when i injured my foot. No X-ray advised. I still feel painful after 2 weeks so I went back to ask for an xray. Next day to get the report and the doctor wrote me a referral letter to hospital. I asked for an X-ray image they said they can’t provide. I asked them do you expect me to do another X-ray in the hospital within 2 days ? They finally said they can provide it with a charge. From the 1st and  2nd consultation and the review of the X-ray plus the referral letter and get an image for my X-ray copy, they kept charging me every time. First consultation why didn’t ask me for an X-ray ? 2nd consultation charged me consultation fee without any consultation. I told the doctor I need an X-ray and he said yes, you need an X-ray. I stayed in the doctor room about 1minute. 3rd time to review my X-ray, charge me again. Write a referral letter charge again.  Ask me to go hospital immediately but didn’t give me the X-ray image. Ask for an image, charge again !!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105948531083249953668/reviews

Angeline Chua,1,Staffs talked to me professionally however this outlet has a lot of foreign workers. Admins were seen shouting at them. Talking to them impolitely. They are also humans and should be treated with respect despite their race. Very unprofessional because of the discrimination.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107848593796904511790/reviews
