Zann Loo,5,"1st time having dinner to celebrate birthday with family. Placed wasnâ€™t crowded during weekdays. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Ordered chili crab, black pepper crab, pork ribs, prawns roll, yam ring, pan-fried beehoon all were great, except yam paste not very suite our taste as it added some sweet corn which we donâ€™t like corn and not the authentic taste of oh nee. Overall dishes were above average, crab very fresh. Hope they can keep up the quality and standard. Lastly thanks for their promotion dine free for birthday baby. Will recommend more birthday babyðŸ˜….",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117576178053754062287/reviews
Liew Weng Lok,4,"Overall the food was delicious and the seafood was fresh, the crabs were decent and just one would have been enough for 6 people, the rest of the dishes were delightful as well. The pepper crab sauce was fine and spicy, and if the chilli crab sauce could be spicier that be great. There were a lack of waiters that could take orders that evening, so had to exercise some patience.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105541988882949864979/reviews

All the food we ordered were excellent and very delicious. Fresh and if we could eat more, we wouldnâ€™t hesitate. Crab with butter sauce was very very good. Glad we discovered this place. Weâ€™ll be back!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112577673118398449195/reviews
