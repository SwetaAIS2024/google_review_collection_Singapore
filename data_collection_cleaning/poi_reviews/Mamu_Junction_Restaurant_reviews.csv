Aminuddin Jamil,1,"DISGUSTING..!!! This restaurant CONFIRM using recycled straw & probably plastic cup too. It supposed to be single use only. Food taste also average. If you don't care using other people straw, this restaurant is for you. Had to cut it to prevent other people experiencing the same as me.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115039571020774789979/reviews
Jd L,3,"Came here for the food as they opened late. Think they are understaffed. The 3 waiters serving are really almost running around. Longer then usual waiting times for food. Although food is tasty, not the usual flavour. Masala tea a little weak for my liking.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115003699534688199669/reviews

Gator,4,"I had always drove past this restaurant late at night after my massages but never really stopped to eat or drink anything. Tonight, decided to try them out.

By the way, it’s the only eatery around the area opened till late. I visited at 2am plus and there was still a crowd in the restaurant. Saw many people having shisha here as well. Ample seating space though and right beside the parking lot. There’s loud music playing at the background which we found it rather annoying as we needed to scream to simply talk to each other. There was also a large tv screen featuring football matches. Would have preferred the background music to be softer.

Ordered the roti John chicken and my friend ordered the teh Tarik. Honestly the roti John was pretty good, oozing with sauce and mayo and the dish came with serving of fries and coleslaw, not your typical roti John serving but we appreciate it. Understand from my friend that the teh Tarik was fragrant and tasty but I only had the teh o kosong ice which was standard.

Prices were reasonable and I believed we would visit again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
