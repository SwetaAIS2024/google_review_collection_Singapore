I even got to see a family of wild boars!\nThere are toilets and water fountains available at the ranger station.",

The monkeys will come for your food.\n🦨The MacRitchie Nature Trail offers hikers a raw, rugged hike through the wilderness.\n🦫Hike the Trail, break some sweats and immerse in the great mother nature. 🍂🍁🌿",
