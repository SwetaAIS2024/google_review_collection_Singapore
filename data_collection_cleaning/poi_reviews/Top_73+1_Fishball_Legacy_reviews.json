The noodle is just nice.. All perfect. No wonder they get Singapore Best Food! I will come back to try others in the menu.\n\nLove it!",

      "text": "Was in search for a quick dinner on a weekday and walked into this empty stall. Surprising, this is one of the best fishball noodle I tried for awhile! The big fishball told me that it is homemade without even trying. Upon the first bite, it was heavenly good with its chewy and tenderness! It was fresh and awesome, worth that $5.50 I paid. The noodle was chewy and spice to the perfection! A halal certified stall that sells fried rice and other sides like fried wanton too. During that 20 min of dining in, I was proven wrong that it was a quiet looking stall. Many people walked it to collect their takeaway and seems like it is a popular go to for residents of the estate. Surely will be back and with my family soon!",

I liked the paste, just about a nice amount of taste that will bring me back to try their other menus.\n\nNothing fantastic about the dining area, just enough for you to enjoy your bowl of noodles.\n\nVery nostalgic area for me as I grew up there and came back years later to find this gem.\n\nWhat's more important to me is that it is halal certified.",

I would say taste was average but serving size for $6.50 was well below average. Flavor was alright. I think EAT chili ban mian was much better.",
