Gabriel Lo,5,"We were recommended to Dr Ooi to check on my Mum's varicose vein. Really glad that we came across such a patience and responsible doctor.
Dr Ooi made sure that he clearly explained the condition my mum is probably suffering and proposed the possible treatments to her on the first visit.
On our subsequent visit in December 2024, it shows that the condition worsen, but Dr. Ooi was due for his overseas leave on the following week.
I asked for his help if we could get the surgery done within the next few days and he quickly got his team to check on the available slots. We are thankful that it was done prior his leave or it could have been much worst.

Even when he was on his overseas leave, occasionally he would text to ensure that things are in the right order.

Once again, thank you Doctor!

Highly recommended!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100401268057391859927/reviews
