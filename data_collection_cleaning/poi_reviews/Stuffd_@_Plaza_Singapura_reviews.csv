deani e,5,"super super grateful for the staffs from this outlet for tanking my huge order this noon üôè

was looking to get meals for 25 pax and ordered from deliveroo to order for later. i was honestly expecting the order to be rejected, assuming that this branch may attract quite a physical crowd but they nailed the order! (ordered vegan and vegetarian bowls and wraps as well)

Hani Razali,1,i ordered deli bowl on the 19/04/25 around 2:38pm-2:42pm. i ordered from plaza sing before but idk what is wrong with this indian staff today. i told the staff only cucumber no lettuce but she still grabbing the lettuce to put it in until i had to literally stop her. then i told her roasted sesame sauce she look genuinely confused. the portion she gave was also very little. usually it's a scoop of ingredients but i'm giving such puny portions literally less than a scoop and i'm still paying full price for it. i love the deli bowl but this experience made me really disappointed and honestly quite frustrating,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116832470221259896708/reviews
