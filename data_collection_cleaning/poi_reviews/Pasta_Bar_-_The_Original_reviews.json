The chefs were great too, and I ordered scallops for starters and Truffle pasta as mains which was very tasty, well cooked to perfection and the pasta was generously topped with sliced truffle chunks. Honourable mention is the scallops starters, tastes exactly to my liking.\n\nWill definitely come back and will also definitely recommend to give this place a try",

      "text": "I finally tried Pasta Bar after hearing so much about it — and I have to say, I get the hype… sort of.\n\nWe had the appetizer which is the soft shell crab tacos, nice flavours but only two pieces. The pasta itself? Fantastic. You can tell it’s handmade and cooked perfectly al dente, with rich, flavourful sauces that actually make you slow down to savour every bite. I had the Tagliatelle beef ragu ($34), and it was easily one of the best I’ve had in Singapore. My friend’s sea urchin tagliolini pasta was also beautifully done, with just the right brininess and kick.\n\nBut here’s the catch: for the price we paid, the portions felt a little small. The ingredients, while high quality, were minimal too. The Japanese bafun uni only 3-4 pieces while the rest of the pasta was soaked up in the sea urchin broth. ($42) They gave us tongs to take the pasta and also advised us to eat this dish first. I left feeling like 70% full.\n\nAnd the service? I don’t understand why the waiter had to be in a hurry to clear the plates. We were sitting at the bar counter and having a conversation, so he had to go in the middle of both of us to clear the plates, doing it twice and interrupting our convo.",

      "text": "Pasta Bar’s Kaya Tiramisu is a must try. I need to have a proper shout out for it as it completely blew my mind. It’s light, creamy and topped off with a kick of sweetness as a closing really perfected this dish\n\nI also ordered their Braised Ribs. The meat melts in your mouth and I didn’t need much effort cutting down the beef into bitable pieces. If you come with some friends, be sure to get the burrata as well! Nice balance, nice portion to start your dish!\n\nLoved the hospitality as well of the team! Would definitely come back trying their other Signature pastas",

      "text": "My Lovely Solo Lunch in Tanjong Pagar\n\nYou know that feeling when you’ve been eyeing a restaurant for ages, constantly checking their Instagram, drooling over every post? Well, I finally made it happen!\n\nJumping straight to the verdict—HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\nFrom their warm hospitality to the pristine cleanliness and top-notch food quality, everything was just perfect. Whether you're dining solo, on a date, or catching up with friends, this place fits every occasion effortlessly.\n\nThey keep things exciting by switching up their menu seasonally, so there’s always something new to look forward to. And guess what? They’ve just launched their Spring menu—you don’t want to miss this!\n\nOriginally, I planned to have just one glass of wine with my lunch set, but the food and service were so inviting that I couldn’t resist another. A crisp Sauvignon Blanc led to a smooth Port Wine, perfectly paired with their divine tiramisu. What can I say? It was pure indulgence!\n\nGood food, kind-hearted service, and an atmosphere that makes you want to linger—this is the kind of place that makes wine taste even better. I’m already planning to return with my daughter and husband soon.\n\nA special shoutout to the team for welcoming me without a reservation and giving me a fantastic counter seat. Even dining alone, I was fully entertained, watching the chefs craft their beautiful dishes with such artistry. I have nothing but admiration for their work!\n\nSee you soon!",
