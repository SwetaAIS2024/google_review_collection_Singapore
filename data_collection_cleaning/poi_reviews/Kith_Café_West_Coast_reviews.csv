Eliz Tan,5,"Amazing cafe, amazing food, amazing atmosphere. Love this place so much! The food is of such high quality. Totally worth the price we paid for. Excellent service too. Good place to do work too as they have power plugs. The playlist they have is an extra bonus too.

J C,5,"Cozy space in SeaHill/ Oasia Residences, West Coast. Easy carpark just downstairs.
It‚Äôs connected to Oasia Residences Lobby.

Very clean, quiet on a Sunday morning. Perfect for a Sunday morning brunch. Best part is the small indoor play area for toddlers. That kept my toddler happy while i happily enjoyed a quiet coffee. Win win!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110738079466624911906/reviews
