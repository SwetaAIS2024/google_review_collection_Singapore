Randy Ong,5,"I was just exploring the mall after having my coffee, and was attracted by the playful decor and gelato display. I ordered two tubs of premium gelato for takeaway which was carefully packed. I swear I saw the cafe owner did a little skip when she handed me my gelato - that's how enthusiastic (and genuine) she was in selling her ice cream, I guess. Anyway, both Belgium chocolate and mint chocolate were fantastic - my family members enjoyed them. It did melt a little on my way home but that also meant that no emulsifiers or preservatives were used. No complaints; I'll visit again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103272174259363846589/reviews
