The teachers are patient and ensure that the child fully understands the concepts. Ms.Hilda, the center in charge, is very helpful and accommodating to my daughter's frequent changes in lesson timings.

Bryan Teng,5,"A very good tuition centre with great teachers. I have joined Nanyang Educational Consultancy a little late as preparations for my N-Levels, however, with their help, I managed to go from just passing my subjects, to scoring grade 1s and 2s. With the release of N-Levels results, I am now applicable to go PFP which is a great accomplishment that I never knew I could achieve. All of this was thanks to Nanyang Educational Consultancy.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104458180788649624134/reviews

Sebastian,5,"I enrolled my son, Ethan, to Nanyang Educational Consultancy ever since he was in secondary 1. The tutors are patient and meticulous in their teaching. When he was unable to attend some lessons, the staff was also very helpful to adjust to a favourable timing. Fast forward to today, he is awarded the Edusave scholarship for the top 10% within his level. A big thanks to his tutors Louis and Ben!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101522001818530446352/reviews
