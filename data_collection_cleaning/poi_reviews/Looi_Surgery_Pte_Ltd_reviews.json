      "text": "It’s a Saturday and the clinic opens till 12pm. I called to double check if the clinic is open.\n\nThe nurse told me yes it’s open and when I told her I’m coming before 1130am, she discouraged me to come by saying : ahh you want to come ahh ? The doctor is not here yet.\n\nThen I replied : so how I’m not feeling well I have very bad gastric (I always go to Dr Lui for gastric).\n\nThen she replied in a very unwilling tone : Ok lor.\n\nThen I asked her again : so can I come? I’m not feeling well.\n\nAnd she replied : can but you have to wait lor.\n\nSuch a bad attitude! I know the clinic operating hours is until 12pm on sat so  if more patients come the nurse can’t knock off at 12pm sharp.\n\nIf someone rushes to see a doctor before the operating hour esp on Sat half day, it shows that she must be feeling very sick. Isn’t it the duty of the nurse to still attend to the patient and not discourage the patient to come ??\n\nProbably the nurse has been working in the clinic for decades (I know a few of them been working there for their entire life), she shouldn’t throw her weights around by calling the shots and discouraging patients to come.\n\nWhen I reached the clinic, it is not crowded. Only one patient. So I dun understand why is she discouraging patients to come? Or prob because she has been discouraging patients to come when they called thus the clinic has no crowd.\n\nThat is so unprofessional and very bad attitude of the nurse!\n\nDr Lui is a very nice and softspoken doctor. He ddnt know that his nurse is indirectly spoiling the reputation of his clinic. He should look into this issue.",

      "text": "Based on Google search and the medical card, the clinic opens at 9am. So I visited the clinic at 9:15am just now, only to have the nurse tell me that the doctor only comes at 10:30am. This was the conversation between the nurse and I.\n\nMe: The doctor only comes at 10:30am? (Turns to look at the opening hours on the clinic signage) But it says there that you open at 9am. Isn’t he suppose to be here at 9am?\n\nNurse: He’s the doctor. He decides what time he wants to come in. If you want to see him, you need to wait till 10:30am. But let me tell you first, he may come later than that. We can’t guarantee.\n\nWhat kind of irresponsible doctor is this? Also, during my previous appointments with Dr Alan Lui, the appointments are usually 45mins long. 10% of the time is spent on the actual medical issue, while 90% of the time is spent listening to him talk about his younger days. It’s so painful to hear and I sometimes have to pretend to laugh in order not to seem rude.\n\nVisit this clinic if you have plenty of time to waste.",
