Jason Goh,5,"Dr Wong Kutt Sing is the best doctor my mom and I know. We have known Dr Wong for more than 15 years. He practically saved my mom's life and we are forever grateful. His surgical skills are second to none and his bedside mannerism is truly examplary. It reminds me of the quote from the movie Patch Adams. When you treat the disease, you win some, you lose some. But when you treat the patient, you always win. Dr Wong treats his patients, and not only the disease ðŸ˜Š",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114549533851003423480/reviews
chinhong tan,5,I had a surgery conducted by Dr Wong Kutt Sing. He is very professional throughout the treatment and the outcome was very successful. I was discharged on the same day and recovered earlier than expected. Highly recommended.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107117081025845328641/reviews
