Otak otak texture is light unlike normal ones are firm and chewy which is what I personally preferred. Ikan fish is the outstanding one and I love the Nogh Hiang\n\nDef give it a try when you are at that area.",

      "text": "Firstly, the standard isn’t that great. Being a Peranakan myself, I know how the taste of these dishes should be. The otak otak and hee peow soup including the fish ball are way too salty! Brought it up to the service staff but no service recovery whatsoever. The asam fish is too sour and not much taste. We were surprised that the hee peow soup ($20.80++) was served in 3 small bowls and where was the balance?! The price totalled to $203.35 for 3 pax and that’s too expensive for this kind of standard. Very disappointed.\n\nI don’t think I’ll recommend this place to anyone in future. My HK friends didn’t quite enjoy it.",

Place has a nicer and more cosy feel compared to previously.\n\nItems on the menu look pretty much the same. We'd otak otak, ayam buah keluak and sambal terung. Dishes tastes good although the portions seem to have shrunk.\n\nNonethless still a nice place to visit for peranakan food. Overall a pleasant dining experience and looking forward to the next visit.",

Ngoh hiang was great. Cendol good. Ayan bua keluak best. Overall, too expensive. Spend about $60+ per pax, but that's also because of the fish. Atmosphere is too noisy and no network connection and wifi.",

While it's been around for a long time, and the recipes might be traditional, the overall quality is just average.\n\nDishes like the Nyonya chap chye, Hainanese pork chop, and fish maw soup tasted as if they had been pre-prepared and assembled upon ordering.\n\nIf you happen to be in the area, or are dining with elderly family members, this could be a reasonable choice – a safe bet, if not a particularly exciting one.",
