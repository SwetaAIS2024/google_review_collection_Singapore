      "text": "Simplified fine dining in the west. This place is a pleasant surprise. An almost exclusive dinning restaurant with only 4 tables. This means you get carefully curated menu, food quality and a nice environment to dine & chill in. Reservations highly recommended. Would liked to have taken more photos but it was a business lunch. 3 course meal on a weekday was the best choice. The mushroom soup starter is so exquisite and creamy, a must to try. Kudos to the Chef.",

Every dish was so fresh, balanced and delicious, it's so hard to pinpoint a favorite! Even the mango sorbet was so good? But the highlight was definitely the pesto gnocchi pasta for me cos it tastes so different from what I was used to. I'll definitely be back again! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòã",

      "text": "For the price (about 90 per pax after tax), i thought the food was quite mediocre.\n\nTuna Tartare - the truffle oil didn't quite go with the rest of the dish and the pistachios didn't add anything either.\nZuppa - a bit too tart, but a good amount of seafood.\nPomfret - I felt the sauce was also too tart and a bit too thick.\nBeef - this was cooked well\nPistachio ice cream cake - this is just ice cream with  a very thin sponge at the bottom. The ice cream has a nice buttery flavour but the pistachio flavour was weak.\nTiramisu - too much cocoa powder, and the coffee flavour was too strong.\n\nIt's quite a small place, but the ambience is ok. Quiet and peaceful.",
