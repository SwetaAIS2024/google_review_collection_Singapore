Has many seats along this platform for resting as well as to catch sunrise and potentially some sunset views.\n\nGood placement in front of Starbucks that you can take a break there if you’re tired or thirsty as well!",

The area is easily accessible with a short walking distance from MRT comparing to the rest of lakeside garden. The only downside is the area locates directly under sunshine without shades, so bring sunscreen or umbrella to avoid sunburnt.",
