The location is relatively close to nearby metro stations, making the journey to downtown and airport seamless. The nearby restaurants were also great. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Singapore!",

The air-conditioning is wonderfully cold, and clean drinking water is provided in-room, with unlimited refills from the tap.

      "text": "Horrible and terrible experience. I’m a local booking this hotel to stay close to my office as I am having several back to back packed meetings and working days. Arrived at Hotel 81 Gold around 8:30pm. Exhausted, and have night work calls incoming.\n\nThe receptionist said must have physical passport or IC to check in. NO WHERE on Trip.com when I booked stated it needed physical passport or IC to check in, and that popular online identifications like Singpass won’t be allowed. On Hotel 81 website they stated to check in will need either “valid government issued identification or passport”. Singpass is a valid government issued identification. So, it is NOT clear (I have screenshot to prove).\n\nThe receptionist said this need for physical passport and IC to check in rule was enforced since LAST WEEK 29 March 2025, so no choice I won’t be able to check in. Only one week of enforcement, absolutely nowhere in Trip.com, the third party partners they use, stated this SUPER IMPORTANT information??? Even if the rules have changed, their third party partners AND website OUGHT to have clear instructions stated on the BOOKING PAGE when their customers have done the payment for the stay.\n\nThen never mind. Receptionist asked me to speak to Trip.com to ask for modification or refund for this night that’s unused. Because there is nothing she can do. Took several hours just for Trip.com to come back and say Hotel 81 declined any modification or refund, despite their ultra LACK of communication across all platforms they receive customer bookings. Their hotel 81 customer service email isn’t even valid when I tried writing in. Just horrible terrible experience smacked on a crazy evening I have from work.",
