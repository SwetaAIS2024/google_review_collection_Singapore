Dawn Chew,5,"Usually more of a roast chicken kind of person but this salted chicken had me as a convert!

The meat was falling off the bone, super tender n succulent. My kids who didn't want to eat chicken rice for dinner initially have no complains afterwards. The sauce from the chicken was flavourful and I was slurping it up! Will be ordering for my father's birthday!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116390476804224620029/reviews

Jean Tay,5,"Ordered the steam chicken set for dinner last week, it was so delicious. The chicken was so flavorful and tender that the meat just falls off the bone. The green chili was tangy and spicy enough... superb pairing with the chicken. The rice was also not the standard white rice but very fragrant ginger rice. Overall super value for money and super yummy. Shall try their fried chicken set soon.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108128190318400269216/reviews
Bryanne Liao,5,"The food was amazing! Such tender chicken, crispy (but not oily) begedil and flavourful beef rendang! The nuggets and mozzarella cheese sticks were also a big hit with my kid. Thanks again!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102116313279098867018/reviews
