Suzita Selamat,5,"A wonderful catering experience. Superb communication from the very beginning. Spread provided were more than sufficient for all guest. Lady Boss gave extra quail eggs sambal.
Serving portion was huge. We even manage to tapao home for everyone.
Definitely will recommend to fam & friends!
Thank you Lady Boss Lawa Bintang..üíú",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117316051476926107320/reviews
Yas,3,"The coconut flavour in the rice is a bit too subtle for me. The sambal leans towards the sweeter side, with a pleasant prawn taste. I'm a fan of basic nasi lemak but for those who enjoys variety of side dishes, then it's worth a try",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102657535738100004870/reviews
Helmi Zainal,4,"Nasi lemak is very tasty, no doubt about it. But $25 nasi lemak for a small lobster seems overpriced but that is just my opinion.

Service is very slow. Ordered 1st round for dine in, it took some time but we thought maybe because the lobster need a longer time.

Then ordered again 2 additional rice only for dine-in (all the rice we ate as I said it was tasty) and 4 packets of takeaways of chicken nasi lemak. They instead prepared all for takeaway.

When we ask for the rice as we need it for dine-in, the young female order-taker wearing tudung rolled her eyes and said it‚Äôs not ready. Quality product indeed but service need to be much better.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109183946001642289908/reviews

Xiankai Heng,5,"best nasi lemak around! the chilli is fantastic too. owner is friendly as well. they always sell out early so must come earlier to avoid disappointment!

p.s. don't park at red lots...URA won't hesitate to clamp your car with the slightest infringement.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106651514884563559394/reviews
