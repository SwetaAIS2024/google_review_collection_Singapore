Parkavi Venkateshwaran,4,"This shop offers excellent customer service. They will assist you in setting up your tank without pushing unnecessary products. For the initial setup, they recommend only the essentials. Their prices are also competitive compared to other stores. Even if you're not making a purchase, they patiently answer all your questions about aquarium setup.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111413628663325688693/reviews

Theodore Tedo,3,"Mixed experiences due to two different staff.
The guy with no specs is friendly and helpful. He was patient in answering questions. He also demonstrated sincerity in helping me to set up my tank well by sharing many tips and advice. It was always a great experience with him around, whether I buy anything or not.

The bespectacled guy, on the other hand, is unfriendly and arrogant. He seems to be more helpful towards customers that he thinks will spend big and carries a condescending attitude towards the others. An unpleasant experience when he is around, perhaps because I usually tend not to spend so much at the shop.

Tanks are generally well maintained and the fishes look healthy. Wide range of accessories available although some tend to be on the high side. Maybe due to them being of high quality. The plants are beautiful and great.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103671712544144171146/reviews
Joel Teh,5,"Niche aquarium store with a focus on aquascaping.

Clean with really beautiful planted tanks. Tanks here really look much better maintained than most other shops.

I started my planted tank journey here thanks to Gabriel.

When not too busy, he was very helpful and willing to share knowledge without being very pushy in his products. Gabriel recommended only the most essential and even helped advise which should be prioritized for a successful tank.

Will definitely return once tank is cycled to browse further.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103676622537853512169/reviews
Demi Bear,1,"I made my way to the shop today because they had something i needed. On google it had stated that the shop will be open at 11AM. So tell me why i had to wait till 11:15AM and still no signs of any staff setting up the shop. The shop is just CLOSED. It got me thinking, does this happen everyday? What time does it actually open? I eventually decided to leave and have to make a detour to another place. Truly inconvenienced and disappointed. No closure notice was put up anywhere so i assume the shop is operating normally. Lateness is such a turn off.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113300462499411232656/reviews
