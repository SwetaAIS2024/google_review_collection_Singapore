L X,3,"It's a hit or miss really. I had pretty decent bibimbap here before and I quite like the fried dumpling and rice cake. However, today I had a lunch set with sad looking veg noodles and grossly soggy rice cake. I wasn't even asked what sides I would like for my set and the staff was rather curt throughout the communication we had. When I was here a year or 2 ago, service was pretty good!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108331100723775684644/reviews
Benson,5,I am a Paik Bibim fan and had visited every Paul Bibim branch in Singapore. NTU branch is always the best one to visit. It is so much better than many other branch. The food is very nice and so fresh! The staff are all very friendly and always provide very good service!,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113444581489001907132/reviews
moe by,5,"I have a great experience with Paik's Bibim@NTU.
I had 26 guests to visit NTU from Korea and ordered set meal for them from Paik's Bibim@NTU.
Manager Mr Mike and a lady( didn't get name) delivered the food from shop to venue even though the distance is far and weather is hot.
We had a great meal !!!
Thanks Mike and aunty.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115131074069731406740/reviews
Kok Yiong Lam,1,"I am surprised by all the 4 or 5 stars reviews here . I had the spicy pork bibimbap today  and it must be the worst bibimbap I ever had, compare even to hawker stalls . I can’t taste any red gochujang sauce at all …",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100235648509202385147/reviews
Nobita C,4,"Reasonable food quality, noting how I can see food preparation being monotonous and standardised across orders. I liked their iced coffee, though I find their fried chicken a tad too hard.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115632465584200727905/reviews
