      "text": "After the scenic cable car ride, we headed to the Skyline Luge Sentosa, which took the excitement to the next level. At first, riding the Skyride chairlift to the top felt a little scary as we went upward, but the view was incredible. It was so exciting to see people riding the luge carts down the hill right beneath us.\n\nWhen we reached the top, we queued for our turn and hopped onto the luge carts. The moment we started racing down the hill, the adrenaline kicked in! The fast pace and winding tracks made the experience absolutely thrilling. My wife and I were both so happy, laughing and enjoying every moment together. We even had tickets for three rides, and each trip down felt as exciting as the first!\n\nThe combination of the scenic cable car ride and the exhilarating luge adventure made this day truly special. If you‚Äôre visiting Singapore, I highly recommend starting your tour at Mount Faber with the Singapore Cable Car, followed by the Skyline Luge Sentosa for an action-packed experience. It‚Äôs the perfect way to create unforgettable memories with your loved ones.",

      "text": "On 26th April - me and my kids decided to visit the Luge for some fun weekend activity. Unfortunately, my eldest had a black out due to anemia and we didn‚Äôt managed to take the luge down. I would like to thank Asaaf for his job dedication and help in getting us back to the main entrance.\nHe reached out to me when i was trying to get out of the luge area and offered us a safe space to rest. While resting, I observed that operating the entire luge ride was not an easy job. It takes a lot of manpower, coordination and physical strength to get things moving. Every staff needs to ensure the ride is safe and operating in a proper manner and when some of the tourist do not adhere to simple instructions, that makes their job even tougher.\nLastly, thank you Asaaf for retrieving my shoe that got lost in transit. I appreciate that he personally saw us to the main entrance, offered drinks and help when we were lost and not sure what to do when they were already down on manpower.\nKudos to the entire team at the luge! The amount of dedication and hard work is being seen and it makes me proud as a Singaporean. Please keep it up and thank you for ensuring everyone had a safe and enjoyable ride.\nI am coming back again!",
