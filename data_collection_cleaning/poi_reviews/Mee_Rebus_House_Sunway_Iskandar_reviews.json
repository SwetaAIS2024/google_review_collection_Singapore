Even the fried burung puyuh is cold & not crispy and you know it is not fresh from the stove. Infm the staff and she claimed that all the food from hq and they only pre heat. But even if its pre heat it was not hot. Infm the 2 staffs and they claim ignorant.\nI will only gv credit to the ambience but bcos of the food not serve hot & the service of the staff ..i can only grade 2 star for this. Staff need to go for training. Its a waste when the food is nice but serve cold.",
