vivek sojitra,5,"Unique arrangement of flowers in midair to maintain the shape of the flowers even as they wilt and to keep people from touching. There are not only amazing flowers but are arranged in beautiful pots or around some deco! The place is smaller than the other domes but there are so many flowers in such a small space you can easily spend hours in it. Not to mention there are waterfalls where waterfalls with patterns, photo locations to take photos.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104860831525608090471/reviews
Angelina Angle,4,"Walked quite far from Ethnobotany Garden to reach here. And also next to Healing Garden.
The Fragrant Garden showcases many species of plants that have evolved to emit fragrances. The blooms attract butterflies and visitors will be able to spot these and other insects fluttering amongst the plants in the day. An ideal spot for night time visits as many of the plants give off their scents in the evenings.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100373202779329959919/reviews
