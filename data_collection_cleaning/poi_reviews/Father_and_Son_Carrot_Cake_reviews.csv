Silverwave,2,"Nothing like what the Ad & Media had advertised.

I ordered the Yuan Yang version ( black & white ) for $4.00. The back one carrot is non-sliced to smaller piece like the old school style. Hence, bigger piece means less effort, means taste is not up to expectation. The person who cooked this dish is a middle-age auntie. Maybe she is a freshie in cooking this dish.

In short, theres is no wok hey at all. it's not worth the visit to this Carrot cake stall.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101993143865397767139/reviews
R L,1,"From the picture, can tell that the fish cakes seems to be added as an afterthought, was not fried together with the noodles as they are still white in colour. Taste wise sub-par, no wok hey since the fish cakes donâ€™t have any char kuay teow taste.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105531240214074678307/reviews
CW,2,The fried carrot cake is very dry & not tasty. There are char bits on the eggs like charcoal. I think it stays in the wok far too long & lost all the flavours & softness of a typical plate of chye tow kway.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113626212339632338435/reviews
Sherman Bok (IG shermeenator),5,"Tried the black carrot cake, white carrot cake and fried kway teow. Personally love the black carrot cake best as there is a great amount of chye poh that complements the sweet sauce, although all dishes are great too. Me and my other family members gobbled up everything within 10-15 minutes haha.

In general across all 3 dishes, all were surprisingly not too oily, sweet nor salty and there is a rather good balance of flavours. My elderly grandma also loves it!

All in all, hope to try it again (on-site)! Cheers!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111026212192685966904/reviews
Benito Linus,5,Ordered their YY carrot cake at $5. Black one was sweet and radish was soft and nice. White one was spicy and the radish was a bit crisper with many eggs! I enjoyed them. ðŸ˜‰,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114106152376985360330/reviews
