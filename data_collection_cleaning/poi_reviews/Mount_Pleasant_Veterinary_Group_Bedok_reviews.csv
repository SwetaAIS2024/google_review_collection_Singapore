JSYJ,5,"Dr Jane who saw my cat  was incredibly knowledgeable and took the time to answer all of my questions, making sure I fully understood the treatment plan and any necessary medications. I was impressed with their ability to communicate complex medical information in a way that was easy to understand but still thorough.
Throughout the appointment, I felt like my cat was in good hands, and I was grateful for the care and attention given to their needs.

Overall, I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for top care for their pets. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the clinic is clean and welcoming, and the quality of care is second to none. Thank you for an excellent experience!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109017015254817920427/reviews

Jennifer Lee,5,"We would like to say A Big THANK YOU for your patience, compassion and professionalism in taking care of our beloved Rocky (15) & beloved Candy (16).

A special mention to our furkids awesome regular senior vet - Dr Chan Mun Ling. She is very caring, friendly, knowledgeable and conscientious. She always provided me with detailed information on rocky and candy during each visit. She also shared with me a lot of good advice. She took very good care of them for the past 15-16 years since they were just puppies.

Big thanks to Dr Jane Teo, Dr Lee yanyi and Dr Michelle Low who took care of them when Dr Chan was not on duty. All the vets had provided appropriate treatments and stabilised their condition everytime. They always strive to treat our furkids to the best of their abilities so that they are well again.

I always feel at ease as the Vet technician Rodarick and Tricia, vet nurses Shuyin,Jia En and Yiping were always
gentle and careful when handling them for bloodtest, skin scrape, x-ray, injection, medication and treatments.

Dedication and excellent customer service is also seen from the receptionist staff Jasmine, Portia and selina who will calls 1 day in advance to inform me of their upcoming appointments. Staff were also very detailed to go through the prescription everytime when I am back to replenish the long term medications or any necessary visit at the clinic for my furkids.

** especially grateful to Dr Chan and vet technician Rodarick for assisting Dr Chan in the emergency dental procedure for candy on 5th March '22 when her decayed teeths erupted and she bleeded till anemia which was life-threatening to her - Due to her old age with nine existing
illnesses since 2008 and the high risk of the surgery.

We are still very thankful to her regular vet Dr Chan Mun Ling,Rodarick and the whole team of staff of Mount Pleasant Animal Medical Centre (Bedok) who took great care of candy during her post dental surgery hospitalisation at the clinic till she was stable and fit enough to be discharged on 6th March '22.

She celebrated her sweet 16 with us on 16th March '22 (no more regrets.) Our little Candy passed on peacefully at home on 3rd April '22.

ANOTHER BIG BIG HUG AND THANK YOU to all the vets, vet technicians,nurses and staffs. You all made a great and dedicated team!ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111280881461932566884/reviews

Nur Tan,1,"I wrote a WhatsApp message to Bedok branch on 28/12 at 7pm, passed operation hours. Stated in the whatsapp my cat is sick and request for a reply to give me a slit on Sunday.. No reply. Called them today 29/12, 11am, answered by Leong a male receptionist. He read the message but did not call me back. When i called he said appointment for Kiwi? Had the cheeks to said no walk-in when this is already making prior appointment on 28/12 @ 7pm.
Not even apologetic but said will check with doctors. I am still waiting for his reply.
Not empathetic and do not care about the urgency of the animals condition. Not fit to be in this line. This person will indirectly caused serious condition to animals seeking treatment.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118109969765818865280/reviews
