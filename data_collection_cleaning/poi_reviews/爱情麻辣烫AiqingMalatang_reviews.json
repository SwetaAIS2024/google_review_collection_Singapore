      "text": "13 Apr 2024\n\nThis shop just opened a few weeks ago. We continue to believe that  every new shop having one chance to impress us, ðŸ˜„ and tried the foods in this store.\n\nFirst we did not see the price tags so we just selected a few ingredients for the mala ban (dry mala sauce and peanut taste in it). Once we tasted the food, we decided to go with another bowl and this time with bone broth. Also have peanut taste. Interesting favor.\n\nThe lady boss came to check on us for the taste of their food. During our conversation, she realized by herself that some people may be allergic to peanuts.\n\nMSG level ok.\n\nCan revisit.",
