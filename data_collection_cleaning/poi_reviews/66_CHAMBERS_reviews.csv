Russell Tay,5,"Great Vibes at 66 Chambers – A New Favorite Spot!

I recently visited 66 Chambers, and I’m so glad I did! The place has such a chill atmosphere, perfect for winding down after a busy day. While they don’t serve cocktails, they have a solid selection of drinks that more than made up for it. I tried a few of their craft beers, and they were top-notch.

The space itself is warm and welcoming, with a cool, laid-back vibe that made it easy to settle in and enjoy the night. The staff were super friendly and attentive, making sure we were well taken care of the whole time.

If you’re looking for a relaxed bar in Singapore to hang out with friends and enjoy good drinks, 66 Chambers is definitely worth a visit. I’ll be back for sure!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105233115420738168086/reviews
Beverley Boo,5,"Can’t miss it although the entrance may be a little easy to miss, look out for the neon signs.

Great drinks and interesting menu - definitely a different vibe and ambience from the other bars and places in the area. Kim & Ash were really friendly and exceptional service!

Plus points for the music and decorations 😉",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107954309574320381557/reviews
Dares Ashlar,5,"Nice Techno Lounge.

Good place to pre before going to Headquarters for more techno.

Bartenders are so nice and recommend drinks. The drinks are free flow and charged hourly. Recommend this place 10/10.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110423027126453472968/reviews
