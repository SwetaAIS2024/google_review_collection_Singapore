I ordered their best-selling Red Grouper Collagen Fish Soup (S$10) plus a bowl of rice($0.50). They are slightly different from regular fish soup and the queue can be a bit long during meal time.\nUpdate on Dec 2023, they have change the menu and the price has increased slightly.",

Soup has no umami, is kinda like carton collagen broth that‚Äôs poorly seasoned. definitely not like what the initial reviews, seems like it‚Äôs taken over by a Chinese lady. Ordered 2 of the same bowls but one clearly had a lot less soup.\nQuality of the fish and soup is disappointing for this price.",
