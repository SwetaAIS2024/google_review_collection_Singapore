All the dishes we ordered were full of complex flavours and special touches of the chef in the sauce was unmistakable.",

      "text": "This restaurant is situated in a previous chapel and has a nice ambience. The seating may not be ideal as they have couples sitting in the corners. The butter served with the bread was nice. The onion tart is very good and recommended. The cod fish is also recommended. For desert, try the crepe suzette. Service was good. Unfortunately, though we had stated it was an anniversary celebration, nothing special was offered which would have made things more special.",

The most memorable dishes are the complementary bread and the 2 desserts (especially the exotic gourmandise which was sublime). The mains were done very well  but the appetisers pate and the onion tart did not quite impress. Great atmosphere for lunch and service was warm.\n\nWould definitely love to go back and try the other dishes especially the desserts.",

The food was excellent, with the Exotic Gourmandise and Seabream being particularly memorable and delicious. While the steak and chicken thighs were decent options, the staff's attentiveness and thoughtful gestures were truly remarkable. To celebrate my wife's birthday, they even presented us with a commemorative picture, which was a lovely and much-appreciated touch.",

Service is fantastic, food matches the price point, and a wide selection of wines. They even print a proper photo for birthday celebrations, my mom was delighted! We had the steak cooked table side, mushroom ravioli, sea bass, and foie gras starter. Finished with a refreshing dessert, my mom liked the caramel sweets they gave with our check too. Our server, Vnod, was very polished and friendly. For our photo print out, he gave me the option of airdropping photos we took there to him, better than the Polaroid! Would highly recommend!",
