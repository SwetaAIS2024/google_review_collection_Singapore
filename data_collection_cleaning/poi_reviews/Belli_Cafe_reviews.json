      "text": "Directions - Right side of level 1 lifts. I started from the left and had to walk 1 round lol\n\nEnvironment - Small but cosy when seated indoors. There are seats outside the eatery too but I preferred sitting inside. They even played my favorite jpop girl group song... Speed!! Feels like I've transported back to the late 90s early 20s before kpop started trending (in a feel-good manner no less).\n\nOrdered - At the recommendation of the lady boss - Herbal chicken koka noodles and iced coffee latte (50% sugar level).\n\nNot overly herbal and not too salty either. The chicken thigh was like m&ms, melted right off my mouth. The softbones could be eaten as well. The carrots infused with the broth was nice. Overall a comfort food dish worth recommending.\n\nLatte was a surprise find actually. Not too strong but good enough to get some kick out of it.\n\nOverall verdict - Will definitely drop by again if I'm around for decent comfort food at quite affordable prices.",

The wide range of hot and cold beverages menu would excite you with no procastination on decision making. The main food menu would be limited, and seating is limited, too, so avoid busy hours like lunchtime. I usually park at City Gate and walk over for coffee.",

Drinks were $4 on average which I thought could deter the crowd in this area, thought some old school kopi and tea would help draw some folk here.",

The Herbal Chicken had a light herbal taste and wasn‚Äôt as outstanding as I had expected. However, the Fish Soup was on another level‚Äî the soup was superb, and the fish slices were thick and fresh. Coffee was normal. Overall, I‚Äôd give this about 4.5 stars.",
