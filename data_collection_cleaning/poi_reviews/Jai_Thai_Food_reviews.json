Honestly, it is a nice amount of ingredients as I do have a bad experience of having pineapple fried rice with pathetic pineapple bits only. Moreover, this was shared between 2 pax.\n\n>> Tom Yum Soup ($6.50)\nGood portion of seafood, which personally I felt worth the price, do try it! The herbs used are not stingy at all~ Aroy~",
