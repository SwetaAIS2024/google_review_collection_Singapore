Wei Tan,5,"First try and it was a good one. The noodles were nicely cooked and the flavours were wonderful; the onsen egg was a real bonus and elevated the overall taste for me. The fish cake and meatballs were tender and nicely marinated, and I enjoyed the sliced mushrooms too which had a strong vinegary taste. Good value at 5.50 I feel. Definitely worth recommending.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113727367121706943852/reviews
Chee Wee,5,"First time trying the mazesoba from Mr Meepok. Thoroughly impressed by it's taste. Noodles are cooked perfectly and drenched in a really flavourful sauce. The onsen egg is a great addition as once stirred in, gave the noodles a creamy texture. The aburi pork slices while thin is packed full of flavour too. For $6.50, this is a must try.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109066499176948242778/reviews

John L,3,tried the maze soba...wish bigger portion n wish they torched the pork belly slices more n remove the bones fir better eating experience.  Tasted better after added in the belachan chilli as the acidity cut thru the richness,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111561812539689988968/reviews
Chunwen Huang,4,"Came on a Tuesday morning, lots of seats available in the coffeeshop. Queue was also fast and service was great; they sent the food to my table.

Ordered the signature minced meat noodle with Meepok (plus chilli and vinegar). Texture of the noodles were great, ingredients were generous. I love the lard’s flavour in it too. Albeit the ingredients being really good, I somehow feel that something is lacking from this bowl (not sure if it’s because the flavour is towards the sweeter side rather than savoury).

Nonetheless, still enjoyed this bowl of meepok!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636541114526759357/reviews
