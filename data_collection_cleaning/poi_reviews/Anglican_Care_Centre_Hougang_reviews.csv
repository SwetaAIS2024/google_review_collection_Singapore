Divine X,1,"Not even worth a star. The place is so bad every1 stays there hates the place, staffs, food, management, the resident there. The Philippine staffs are heartless & have no empathy for the patients there working here just for the money not caring for patients at all. The residents have extremely bad psychiatric issues that are worse than institute of mental health patients always shouting insulting & scolding the residents here. Residents here harrass & beg for food & money too. When asked for help The staffs say theyâ€™re not maid and deny of help. The staffs kicks bed to wake patient up & is vicious & uncaring in many ways & controlling too.  Pls do not end up in this place. Is really a bad place to be in. Extreme corruption & Low vibrational depressing dumpster. People here r desperate to get outta here. Everyoneâ€™s lunatic including the staffs. Went there expecting to get better but I got worse even suicidal people here make me wanna kill myself. Iâ€™m supposed to come here to rehab but instead I got harassed & bullied by the staffs and people here. They keep accusing me of doing things I didnâ€™t do making me a scapegoat of other peoples wrongdoings. Staffs keeps controlling me taking advantage of my vulnerabilities. When I wear my long dress they scold me & tell me I canâ€™t wear my dress keep controlling what I wear or do. Evil sick people. Staffs & residents wanna see me do worser. Itâ€™s that bad.
