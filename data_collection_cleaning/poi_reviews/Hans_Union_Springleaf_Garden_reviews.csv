Doris Teo,4,"I ordered the sweet and sour pork rice. The dish had a strong oily taste, likely due to the wok not being thoroughly cleaned. The sauce was also a bit too sweet for my preference. Otherwise, it was enjoyable. The other dish that I ordered was herbal chicken with rice which was quite tasty.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111865996352668089029/reviews

CS Pang,3,"Posting review as a regular diner here, food quality and staff attitude is excellent.
Recommend their plant based cuisine and western menu.
