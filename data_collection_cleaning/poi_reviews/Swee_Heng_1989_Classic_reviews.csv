Dylan Li,4,"The pineapple bun egg tart fusion was a bit of a miss as I didn't like the ratio (too much egg tart filling). The pandan bun and  cranberry muffin were pleasant though, and the bakery is certainly good quality.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227455027475284936/reviews
Eric Ang,5,"Bought a mango cake at clementi mall. First time buying from swee heng.

Swee Heng also halal certified.

Staffs very friendly and fast. I was surprised that store also provided paper plates and fork (6) beside the knife. So far this is the first time I saw such service provided.

Kudos.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104331774780307520616/reviews
Ciel Shum,4,"I like the mini four flavors bread the most, it was just soft and tasty.
The salty egg machi one was ok the salty egg inside was nice, but the machi and the whole bread was a bit too sweet for me.
Pandan soya milk chiffon melted in my mouth and was fragrant.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103294628827085751223/reviews
Kuku Bu,4,"I tried my chocolate bun from this chain but not as good as I expected. Still think that the chocolate bun from the other brand is better. Reason being its custard base chocolate filling and I was expecting teal chocolate (read: nutella etc)

Tried their Swiss roll which is decent, love the fact that it comes with peanut coating. Very tradition!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100862256026468517024/reviews
Em woo,4,Really like the buns from swee heng 1989 especially the ones with the mochi. Tried the taro mochi and the sweet pumpkin mochi bun! Super soft and chewy. Perfect for breakfast or tea!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106219834003454494418/reviews
