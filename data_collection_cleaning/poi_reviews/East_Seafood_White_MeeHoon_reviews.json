Thick & not salty can‚Äôt taste MSG. There is no shao xing wine & ginger shreds added meaning the  lala, prawn & crayfish are all fresh that  no need to use extra ÂéªËÖ• ingredients to cover the taste!\n\nMost importantly , the bee hoon has wok hey! Unlike most of the shops  which only give u plain white bee hoon! This is an extra star given for this shop! We will definitely eat again!",

      "text": "Last Saturday,  I came across this White Mee Hoon at Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre, managed by Foodfare. It means there is at least one dish selling at $2.80. White Meehoon (Veg/Lala) at $2.80. My wife and I went for Crayfish Lala Prawn Meehoon $15. The portion was large, enough for 3 adults. The stock of meehoon was deliciously rich with flavours. The crayfish, prawn and lala (clams) were very fresh. The stall holders were friendly and honest.  I initially ordered $20 , but he said $15 is more than sufficient for 2 adults. The meehoon was dry fried to give the smokiness aroma before adding the stock. Heavenly taste. They have pure fish version for those who have prawn or crayfish or clam allergies.  Value for money. I like the white meehoon so much that I went back in the evening to buy another two tubs of $20 each for my whole family to try. üëçüëçüëçüòã",
