Sera // IG: diningwithsera,4,"Using only the freshest, premium ingredients, this artisanal bakery offers an exciting range of cakes that cater to all kinds of flavour cravings. Originally a humble bakery from China, they are shaking up the cake scene in SG with its intriguing creations.

I tried their mala cake ($5.80) which consists of Fiery Sichuan peppercorn & chilli, rich pumpkin purée & a crunchy chocolate-sesame finish. This savoury creation was giving a solid 中辣 kick. Also if you conquer their mala challenge, you win return vouchers !!

I also managed to try their Thai Milk Tea Millefeuille ($11.80) which uses traditional Thai tea leaves layered with a fragrant Thai milk tea jelly. This was mildly sweet while hitting all the right notes.

Their Magnum Chocolate Cake ($13.80) features a 70% Callebaut cocoa shell & layers of chocolate cake, cream, oreo bits & crunchy choco balls, I enjoyed how the textures were well juxtaposed, without being overly sweet.

Their pandan yam cake ($11.80) is creamy, non-artificial yam paste paired perfectly with fragrant pandan-infused sponge cake, making this the perfect Southeast Asian twist.

We also had their Basque Burnt Cheesecake ($11.50) which while was not a notable dish, it was still an enjoyable classic that’s soft & dense on the inside.

Finally, we also had their Chocolate Pistachio ($13) which consists of rich chocolate paste blended with freshly extracted pistachio oils & a satisfying crunch. My expectations sadly fell a little flat as I was hoping for a stronger pistachio flavour :(

Tried their peach lemon tea ($5.50) and mango fruit tea ($5.50) and I enjoyed the refreshing konjac jelly in both drinks. Albeit on the sweeter side, these were satisfying with strong flavours. Would return for these!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118301436723641326928/reviews
