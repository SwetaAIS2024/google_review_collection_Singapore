Timothy Timuari,5,Fantastic selection of Indonesian goodies. Seriously all the good stuff is here at very reasonable prices too,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104450296048174420786/reviews
LT Wong,5,"Went there to check out the shop. It's not big, but there is a good selection of Indonesian food products. Noodles, bottled and packet sauces for fishes, keropok, cordials. I found my Bango kicap manis (500g pack), but the pedas version was only the small bottle. Hard to find larger sizes except on Shopee for that. Definitely worth checking out if you live in the vicinity. No need to venture out east to Geylang Serai.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107487527261532013673/reviews
