Why would the restaurant choose to use cheap-tasting cheese sauce for their burgers? With the aioli sauce the burger tasted way too creamy and jelat.",

Wife thought the schnitzel tasted like chicken. Buns were fluffy and toasted also. And the fries were amazing - still crispy when delivered!\n\nSo 5 stars to show some love.ðŸ¤—",

After three bites, I was advised it tasted realistic because it was real chicken and not vegetarian! I contacted Grab who advised me that the kitchen was actually aware prior to delivery that the food was incorrect, but failed to advise us. I have attempted to contact them numerous times, and have been promised follow up, but this has never happened. Obviously a company that does not care about its clientele, but more importantly is negligent and careless with no remorse.",
