Kwok Amanda,5,"4 years ago, when I was searching for a childcare around the vicinity, Masterminds Montessori Hillview was the most ideal choice for my family. 4 years down the road, I have all my 3 kids still attending the same childcare.

Masterminds Montessori is a great place to be in and the environment is lively and welcoming. The teachers and principal are all dedicated to their job and treat every child with love and care. They are approachable too should we have any concerns.

I like that we receive regular updates on our childrenâ€™s progress and I look forward to seeing their learning and growth through their Biannual portfolios. In addition, the teachers will also share monthly curriculum web, so that we are aware what the kids are learning in school.

In November 2024, Masterminds also had a year end graduation concert performance and all the kids had put up a good show! Thank you to the wonderful teachers for guiding and teaching them patiently. We enjoyed it very much!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109687514411917564172/reviews
Sandra Bozic Koduru,5,"Our daughter started last January 24 in N1. After a year in the school, we made the right decision. She is happy every single day to be with her friends and teachers.

The director, the principal and the teachers, who are working at Masterminds for many years, are so dedicated to provide a loving, welcoming, safe, caring and fun environment for our children. They are very approachable and open to discussion about our concerns.

The curriculum is well communicated to the parents every months to help and continue the learning at home. Each festivals, organised with lots of efforts, are celebrated with a lot of care and joy.

The environment is clean, well organised, safe. The facilities, learning material and toys are great and well maintained to spend a beautiful day in school. The meals are cooked in the school and healthy (and delicious according to my daughter).

The highlight this year was the graduation show. A fantastic concert was organised by the team. From the costumes to the songs, dances, decor, everything was magical and my daughter enjoyed it so much. I was impressed by the performances and the dedication of the children, even at a young age.

I highly recommend the school for your little one.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114012538219963691598/reviews
