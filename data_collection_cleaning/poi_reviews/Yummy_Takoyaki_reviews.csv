Shirin S,3,"Ordered takoyaki and while it arrived on time, it was ice-cold and quite flat, suggesting that it had been prepared quite some time ago and was not fresh. Was not even sure if it was safe for consumption at that point, since it probably had been sitting in the sauce for a while. Pls be more careful with food prep time.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101658903811130925740/reviews
Mohd Taufik,5,"To the Owner of Yummy Takoyaki,

Today i had a chance to order your takoyaki, and was impressed by the generous toppings – nothing was skimped on, which made for a delicious experience overall!

Even when I had a small issue with my order, the owner was very responsive and handled the situation with great care, offering a refund without hesitation. This level of customer service is rare and much appreciated.

Overall, the food was great, and the service was exceptional. I look forward to ordering again and try the seaweed topping if available.

Thank you",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118405206309380900219/reviews
The Wayfarer,5,"The takoyaki were all sitting in the glass counter, at first I was hesitant to buy cos my overthinking started wondering how long since they were made. Since I was already there I thought I should just buy. And buy I did. It was a family favourite (sans the Dad cos he only eats healthy food). Not saying takoyaki is unhealthy but I suspect the sauce contains sugar and flavorings (eat in moderation, then its okay).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100733714231368593518/reviews
