James A,4,Its a 4 compared to most places to eat in North American airports but a 3 at best for Asia which has great food. This place is ok. I liked it. For the price at the airport I was happy. Not great but fast and pretty cheap for an airport.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107462499074142707055/reviews
Sopagna CHAN - SINGAPORE HEADQUARTERS,1,"Such waste of money, this used to be my to go meal place before my flight, ended up now lower their quality, flavor and quantity, such a fake Vietnamese flavor I had this time. Somethingâ€™s wrong here. I hope this should be improved.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117793601953228163282/reviews
Daryll Kaan,2,"Donâ€™t waste time or money. Got combo pho for $12+ and it was not even worth $6. No beef slices, 2-3 pieces of tripe, 2 pc tendons. No honey comb stomach like the picture. Soup salty. Meatballs were grossly soft and mushy which means not just frozen and not fresh but poor frozen quality balls. Should have just gotten Burger King! ðŸ¤ª",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106832017568129272539/reviews
Sander Veraar,2,"Dropped in for a quick bite, left unfulfilled. The food disappointed, the saving grace being that it was better than what Scoot served us afterwards ðŸ˜†",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114258196809211153751/reviews
Ashley Teo,1,"The food quality is quite disappointing. The beef balls lack flavor, the noodles are hard. The dish as a whole feels bland and lacks any character. And to top it off, it costs a whopping SGD11.90 for this beef ball noodle.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106716166550977020052/reviews
