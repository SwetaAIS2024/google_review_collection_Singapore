A good place to catch the breeze on a hot day.  The winding plank walkway down below add to the picturesque photo against the green water backdrop and the red Lor Halus Red Bridge.",

      "text": "We love this red bridge and quiet often pass through this. However, I recently took my 7-year-old daughter to this new playground which was opened recently quiet near to the red bridge and sunrise bridge. I was really impressed with the design and thoughtfulness that went into it. The playground is suitable for children of all ages, from toddlers to school-age kids. There are several rope-based climbs, spinning wheels, and tunnels, as well as slides and a sand pit. My daughter had a blast exploring all the different structures. She especially loved the rope based climbing structures. Families visiting the bridge can take a small detour if kids want some fun.\n\nI was also impressed with the safety features of the playground. There are soft fall surfaces under all the equipment, and the playground is fenced in to keep children safe. I felt very comfortable letting my daughter play although I supervise her.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with this playground. It's a great place for kids of all ages to have fun and get some exercise. I would definitely recommend it to other parents.\n\nHere are some of the things I liked about the playground:\n\n* It's well-designed and safe for children of all ages.\n* There are a variety of activities to choose from, so kids of all interests can find something to enjoy.\n* The playground is clean and well-maintained.\n* It's located in a convenient location (next to the sunrise bridge), making it easy for families to get to.",
