It was horrible. They finished the procedure in less than 10 minutes! It was an 'anyhow' cleaning like they can't be bothered and the doctor was in a rush to complete it. It was painful at some time too. Never going back to this clinic again. Terrible service rendered!",

Go at your risk, prefered Q&M just that no slot fully booked. But well. Last min thing. I was told that i need to pay certain percentage & i agreed.\nThe counter lady told me an amount. Afterward the session end another amount. It alright though.... just not standard.",
