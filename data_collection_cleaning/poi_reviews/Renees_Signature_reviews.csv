Shu Wen Yang,2,"Portion size was good. Carbonara was very creamy. Corn was juicy. Steak was very very bad. Huge part of it was so tough and overcooked that I had to shred it to eat it yet spit out quite a bit, while there was one part that was so rare as you can see in the photo. There was also a large chunk of fat.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112355157285840569002/reviews
Yit Leng Ho,5,"Not sure why people gave bad review. But maybe it's the steak that was bad.
We had chicken chop with cabonara.
The nuggets and fries are very nice. Not oily and they were crispy even after awhile.

The chocken chop was so good my 7 years old son finished it all.
Didn't manage to take the picture before they eat so here's the finished look.

I would come back again for this 😀",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106166210832446948478/reviews
Kerine Lam,3,"I usually enjoy dining at Renee’s for their western food, but unfortunately, today’s experience fell short. I ordered the carbonara and was quite disappointed, it was extremely salty, and the sauce had visibly curdled, likely due to being cooked at too high a temperature. The overall dish felt rushed and lacking in care.

When I provided my feedback to the lady at the counter, I was told that the pasta wasn’t salty and that previous customers hadn’t mentioned anything. While I appreciate that taste is subjective, I felt dismissed and somewhat invalidated when I was told that I just couldn’t take salty food, rather than acknowledging that something may have gone wrong in the preparation.

To be fair, they did replace my pasta with an aglio olio, which I appreciated. However, as I collected the food, she reiterated that she felt that I couldn’t take salty food. The way the feedback was handled left a sour note. I hope the team can take customer input more openly in the future, as I’ve had better meals and experiences here before.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105328743358367373931/reviews

HP Tan,2,A very sad plate of Premium Ribeye steak. Doesn't look like the stall or the chef is bothered to make an effort. The veg is watery and only plain lettuce (the picture show a whole different presentation of salad). The steak was so thinly cut it didn't matter how you want your steak to be done because it's overcooked and hard (i asked for medium).,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110934298946011370634/reviews
