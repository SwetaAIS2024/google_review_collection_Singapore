Dora Cheok,5,"My sisters and I did the Gin Distillery tour and it was fantastic! We got to make our own Singapore Slings and brought them with us for the very educational distillery tour. After which, we had the tasting session with 8 different kinds of gin. Let me just say that we left the Brass Lion in very good cheer ðŸ˜Š. Please make sure you eat carbs before your tour. They serve food at the bar too - you'll need both. Special shout out to Aileen our gin expert who navigated her way through our increasingly boisterous group. YOU ROCK ALIEEN!!!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108059376733520460070/reviews
Joyce Liong,5,"The cocktail class, distillery tour + tasting was great fun. Would recommend if you are looking for a fun activity to do on a weekend or as part of your trip in Singapore. Itâ€™s great to see how small businesses like these are born from the founderâ€™s passion.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105591870226459037686/reviews
Pam Chicandard-Tan,5,"Took part in the distillery tour and Singapore sling cocktail making lesson. Both experiences were excellent and fun. So proud of this home grown mirco distillery and to learn how they have grown.

The instructions to the cocktail lesson from our guide was very clear with hands on chance to make your own Singapore Sling.

Our guide to the distillery tour was very knowledgeable. Her communication style was really clear, friendly and candid. The content of the tour was very interesting.

Overall, plenty of gin tasting opportunity for a Saturday afternoon. So pace yourself nicely ðŸ˜Š",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117007487318010463680/reviews
Barry Goh,5,Had a great time at the Brass Lion Distillery today! Wasnâ€™t too sure what to expect tbh but was pleasantly surprised and delighted with the overall experience. Aileen (hope i spelt this right) took us through the Sling class which was then followed by the distillery tour and then a 3-flight taster (which ended being 8). Enjoyed the tour presentation and great service! Thank you - recommended!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108087599281568083215/reviews
Sarah Siah,5,"A very nice experience, Aileen was super nice and even topped up a few drinks from our gin tasting. On top of that their tea series gin was really good.  Lastly you also get to choose a cocktail of your choice and I chose the boozy hot chocolate which was perfect for the Christmas vibes! Overall I think itâ€™s worth the visit if you are a gin lover:)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104363530915018498183/reviews
