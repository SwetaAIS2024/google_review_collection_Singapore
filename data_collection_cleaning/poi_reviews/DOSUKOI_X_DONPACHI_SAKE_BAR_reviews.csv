PF Wern,5,"This Japanese restaurant serves authentic Japanese cuisine in an ambiance that truly feels like dining in Japan. I particularly enjoy the fresh sashimi and cold soba, which capture the original flavors of the dishes. If you are a lover of Japanese food, you should definitely give this place a try. üëÖ",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104795800049377208676/reviews
Cue Chin,3,"Authentic restaurant with good variety of unique dishes. However, absurdly high prices for absolutely no reason while also providing tiny portions. For example, their gyu tan steak for $30 was just a small yakiniku piece cut up into even morr thin, tiny slices. No doubt ingredients and overall taste was good but common dishes at izakaya like this should not even cost half at these portions. Some of the items such as the ebi tempura was charged at $8++ per piece. Sashimi selection for. $68++ and $88++ provided mediocre selection such as salmon and maguro.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106982370953978881064/reviews
Es Wee,5,"Authentic izakaya in the middle of town. The tempura is excellent and u can get pork ribs oden too. And if you are lucky, or stay late enough, u can enjoy their kakigori. Do try their homemade umeshu too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116429387907906558348/reviews
V. H.,4,"B1 of Cuppage plaza is pretty damn sleazy but don‚Äôt let it deter you from having an authentic Japanese experience. They have some great grilled stingray fin to go with beer, food is good but not out of this world, can tell that they are being prepared meticulously. Must try their ume sake/shochu. They have a wide variety of ume drinks, those are very good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109398868789939950513/reviews
Î¶¨ybboÎπÑÏùç,2,"Wanted to have decent Japanese food around the area. Saw the high rating and decided to give it a try. Greeted by the service staff/owner and bring us to the counter as we did not make any reservation. Very congested restaurant. The other table of 8 were chatting loudly as I guess they had lots of drinks. Ordered out food as there isn‚Äôt any picture, this is quite a Japanese restaurant in Japan. Oysters are very good. The Sashimi is decent, very thin slices. Tonkatsu is a let down. Pork not fresh, probably from frozen. Likewise for the Karage. The rest are very normal. And a bottle of 720ml sake. Total damaged -  $400 plus. Value for money??
