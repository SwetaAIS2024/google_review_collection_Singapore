Coconut milk all frozen and cogulated.\n\nLast time, even takeaways are freshly prepared.\n\nSave your calories for something else.",

      "text": "Chendol is an absolute delight for anyone with a sweet tooth! The perfect combination of shaved ice, sweet coconut milk, and palm sugar syrup creates a refreshing and indulgent treat. The chewy green pandan jelly adds the ideal texture contrast, making each bite a little burst of joy. It's a comforting dessert, especially on a hot day, but also perfect for any occasion. The layers of flavors—sweet, creamy, and just a hint of salty—come together so harmoniously. If you’ve never tried Chendol, it’s a must-try!",

Traditional chendol has a couple of atap seed. This one at $2.50 had none. Hence, I don’t think it deserve to be called chendol, let alone king of chendol.",
