Albert Sim,5,I was at the stall at 6.15 am since its opening hours is stated as 6.30am. The stall owners arrived at 6.45 am to open its shutters and started preparations. The ingredients and gravy were ready first while the bed Hoon was finally closer to 7.15 am and sales started. I waited till 7.30 am for the noodle to be ready as I preferred a mix of bee hoon mee. Credit must be given for the teamwork during the preparations & the quick time they got their act together to serve the simple but delicious vegetarian bee hoon mee.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113438721987197757113/reviews
