Chan Doris,5,"Chanced upon this bakery and bought a chicken pie to try it out.  Wow!  The pastry was buttery and fillings tasty too!
Went back for few others including another chicken pie.  Son had the apple pie and he commented that it is good!  His usual comment is always ""Not bad"" so I believe the apple pie must be really good!
Will go back for more soon!
The lady who served me is friendly and polite and I noticed that the baker is actually a young man in his twenties.
Do check them out if you are around the area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110690292914454660390/reviews
Jason Wong,5,The dao sa piah is yummy. Especially like the sweet one. The mini chicken pie pastry is rich in butter and filling is generous.  The roasted char siew bun is good too. Worth to patronize again and again.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113218531848789406106/reviews
