I say aunty tall prob in your 30 plus …\n\nThe order was already done in a carrier and yet it’s not passed on the pick up table and yet you serve another customer walk so slow like you own the establishment , then I thought once you done serving you pass the order to the table and yet you went off and go somewhere then return back and place at the table . Why not just handle my order then get back to the front of the people of the eyes . It was there for some unnecessary minutes .\n\nAnd because of that my order was wrong delivered . Lose some walk more that way can be faster",
