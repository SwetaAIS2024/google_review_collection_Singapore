      "text": "I recently got takeout and ordered the Chicken Karaage Udon with Chawamushi, all for just $8.50.\n\nThe staff were friendly, the waiting time was quick, and everything was well-packed.\n\nThe Karaage chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It would have been perfect with some dipping sauce, though.\n\nThe udon was exceptionally tasty, but the portion was a bit small.\n\nThe Chawamushi was flavorful, although it felt a bit dry compared to those at Japanese restaurants. Considering it costs only $1.50, it’s still a great deal.\n\nI’ll definitely be visiting again to try more dishes!l",
