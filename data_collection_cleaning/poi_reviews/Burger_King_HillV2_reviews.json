It‚Äôs a quiet and great place to relax.\n\nMeat lovers can have their Whopper, animal lovers can have their juicy Plant-based Whopper. Burger King keeps everyone happy.\n\nFor Plant-Based Whopper, vegans can opt not to have the mayonnaise and religious Vegans/ vegetarians can opt not to have the onions and mayonnaise.",
