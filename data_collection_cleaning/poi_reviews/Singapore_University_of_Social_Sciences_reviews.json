Most employers will not care if SUSS is a “local” university (as long as it’s not NTU, NUS or SMU, it means nothing), and you’ll be better off at SIM.\n\nWhile I have graduated, I relate to many of the commenters here that the professors are less than helpful especially when marking our papers and assignments. They plug a score in with no further explanation on why or how it’s being derived. How are we supposed to learn from our mistakes when it’s not clearly identified?\n\nSchool execs including HOPs are non-sympathetic figureheads who offer little to no help to struggling students. I’ve even had a friend who was diagnosed with a learning disability be told by their HOP that they don’t believe in these learning difficulties. What happened to helping and guiding your students? For a school known for its social service courses, it’s laughable that people who believe in these outdated values are hired, and even promoted. Maybe you should focus on educating your own staff instead of making the process so painful for these students.\n\nStudent help desk is also completely useless. All they know how to do is: ask you to email them and they will redirect you to the next person which results in you going back and forth with no actual resolution. The limited information they do know are also usually inaccurate which leads me to wonder why even provide a number.\n\n10/10 do NOT recommend. Absolute filth of a place.",

      "text": "I can only comment about SUSS based on my own experience in SHBS after graduating. I think there’s good faculty for sure, they don’t spoon-feed students (nor should they be expected to… this is a university, not primary school) but they’re enthusiastic about imparting knowledge from what I’ve experienced. I honestly enjoyed a majority of my lectures and found most of the lecturers engaging and friendly with all sorts of interesting backgrounds.\n\nTraits like self-reliance and resourcefulness have always been a prerequisite for higher learning so I’m not sure why people are complaining about “self-study” at a university level, and it’s quite telling that a number of these bad reviews come from dropouts… I also wonder if complaints about “dubious” marking schema come from students who did not bother to look for a rubrics (which was always provided for all the assignments in my experience).\n\nThat being said, the school is not without its shortcomings. The campus space (or lack thereof) is frustrating; at some point you might find yourself having to make the trip next door to NP for lectures because of the lack of space. The canvas system is fine but there is a somewhat outdated looking services portal that can be quite an eyesore to deal with. Though student services has always been speedy with their replies to me for numerous issues. I have no complaints there. With regards to the campus, as of 2024, at the latest convocation there was an announcement made that they are currently looking at a new building and location entirely so future students may no longer have to share campuses with SIM and NP,  lucky for them.",

      "text": "Despite several bad reviews, I still think SUSS is a decent school. It is more suited for part-time students who do not have a lot of time to attend seminars. 6 seminars per module is just nice for me. I really appreciate how most of the learning syllabus for each module is structured into a study guide (SG) and how they are divided into 6 equal study units (SU) that were from textbook. They really helped streamline our education so that we are able to have work/study balance. For example while attempting the exam questions we can immediately recognise from which of the 6 SU the question have to be referred to. All-in-all, I guess SUSS is not for everyone. It really truly catered to part-timers hence they brand themselves as lifelong learning.\n\nSteve Job from Apple once said:\n\"Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish\"\nWater cooler at SUSS said:\n\"Stay Thirsty, Stay Foolish\"\n(refer to the last image)",
