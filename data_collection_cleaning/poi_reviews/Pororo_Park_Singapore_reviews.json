Very generous portions!\n\nThe only down downside is the walk to the toilet is very far away.\n\nThey only have diaper changing stations available inside. No restrooms for parents.\n\nI appreciate how they have QR codes for entry/exit only for parents to manage the child's activity.",

Then what’s the point of buying tickets online?\n\nSecondly, 0 crowd control. Yes there were signage to state that there should parental supervision at all times. But the older kids were running here and there with ZERO supervision and there was no staff around. Even at places where the play area is more suitable for SMALLER kids.\n\nThirdly, which although was the part my LO enjoyed the most but also the most disappointing one — the show. Once again, there was no other staff around, only the poor crew who was donning the costumes (Poporo, Crong and Loopy). NO other staff was there to control the crowd, kids were running up the stage area, pushing the trio around. This is not even about disrupting the show anymore. This is a legit safety issue. The kid just kept on pushing and hitting and weaving in between the characters and even almost fell.\n\nHonestly you can get your money spent better elsewhere.",
