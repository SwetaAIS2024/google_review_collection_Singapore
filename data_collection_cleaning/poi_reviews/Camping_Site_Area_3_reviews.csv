Irsyad,4,"Camped alone here during weekdays at the very corner of the campsite nearby a play area with sand for 3 days.

Some tips and info.

üëçüèΩ
Place is quiet half the time
Windy depending on the weather
3-5 mins away from Toilet
Toilet has vending machines and water cooler with snacks and drinks ( Only cash or coins accepted)
Playground is nearby for kids to play
There are 2 shelters where you can place your mats there for picnics

üëé
Construction is still here and it starts as early as 9am until about 5-6pm (Quite loud)
Humid temps all the time (Worse during peak sunlight)
Whole campsite area is muddy due to recent downpours
Toilet showers smell like pee with stain marks all over the wall

Advice & Tips
Bring at least 2 portable fans (as big as possible) to combat the heat.
Mosquito repellent is needed here got home with about 10+ bites/stings all over my body
If planning to cook, discreetly does it as it is not legal.
Wear covered shoes ( grass is tall and muddy)
Ear plugs are necessary especially if you plan to sleep during the construction hours.
The water cooler only has a mouth part and you aren‚Äôt able to fill into bottles that easily.
Bring a trolley to push your camping gears.

Overall opinion

Would come here again to camp just dislike the toilet cleanliness. It‚Äôs hard to access here by public transport with carrying all the gear.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107043866943982612425/reviews
A V,5,"Nice area for camping.
Last time we were at West coast park for camping but the experience isn't as good as in Pasir Ris campsite.
It was too noisy until 2-3 am with children still playing at the playground when they should be deep sleeping already.

Today at Pasir Ris, there were people at the barbecue pit so it was also noisy but until 00:30.

Next time we will find a place to too near any bbq pit but wifey wanted to have a good view on the beach.

There is also too much light so I couldn't sleep after 00:30 and took some videos of the lightning in Malaysia. Just wondering what time it will reach our campsite üòÖ",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116768699501663000789/reviews
ken koay,4,"Considered very clean camp site and peaceful except during busy festive seasons there could be rowdy families or company events. Company events are there for bbq but not camping. Families could be there to camp and that's when you hope they're the courteous type who know when to pipe down.

Lots of joggers and fast e-scooters (not sure if it's legal) around so cross the jogging/bicycle tracks with caution.

Has public washroom nearby and a pub, food & drinks are not far away. The beach is... not really clean. hardly see anybody swim there.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105736268783668724455/reviews
