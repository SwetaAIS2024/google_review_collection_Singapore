Kyp Teh,3,"Ordered soup small added enoki and peanuts with rice.

Soup consists of some pork belly meat, some meatballs, taukee, veggies and mushrooms. But sadly ribs only 2-3 which is quite little.

Service is good and food served fast.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106202687367627804376/reviews
