M. Avicenna Naradipa,4,"Convenient mosque near Alexandara road. Good if you're travelling to IKEA or any nearby places. The mosque is a bit small, but is usually not crowded (I went for Asr, haven't tried praying Friday prayers here).

Cat with soft fur also hangs around. Good for de-stressing. Public rented bikes are sometimes available parked in front.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108496617590210380886/reviews
