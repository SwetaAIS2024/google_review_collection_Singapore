Miss Lee,4,"~ Posted on 20250427 ~
I ordered the black pepper chicken chop for $8 from a stall near my house. It felt a little pricey. The dish came with sides like fries, baked beans, coleslaw and a small bread. The taste was average â€” nothing particularly impressive, but decent for a quick meal.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102297421925031477578/reviews
Alfen Neo,5,"Awesome fried chicken. Better than Arnold's.

Revisit on 21 Apr 2025.
Stall just open, the way they fry the chicken and the yummy oil bun still remain it's standard. Yummy.

Probably best fried chicken in North",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109474920214386070491/reviews
kelvin tan,5,"food served really fast despite non stop order. Chicken cutlet is soft tender and juicy. Fries are crispy and nice too. The bun are deep fried and good.
Price not really cheap as its 8 dollars for a Chicken cutlet at a coffee shop.
But I would rate it as worth it though.. the food feels traditional enough unlike many western food with modern name and cooked my Malaysian workers instead of the owner themselves. This simple food are cooked with passion and despite the price, its good food and will enjoy eating.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100510162110919413186/reviews
Kelvin Chen,5,"Old school western. Its has been there for a long long time.

Large portion, generous serving and value for money.

Chicken cutlet was huge, crispy, tasty and not oily at all. The downside was that the Coleslaw was quite bland.

Happiness plate (3pcs) was delicious.

Worth going!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100494436418162510248/reviews
Desmond Tung,5,"The hawker was hidden in plain sight, we were drawn by the fragant of fried bread and ended up at Do & Me. There are queue when we arrived, quickly secure a table and head to order.

We have ordered the fried spring chicken and cutlet. The portion is really huge, we barely finished both plates. The fried spring chicken is huge and crispy, serve along with fries, coleslaw and fried bread while the chicken cutlet is crispy outside, soft inside with same sides. They are quite valued for money!

Though we can't finish the spring chicken in the end, we left the place happily and looking forward to the next visit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110777050171632054952/reviews
