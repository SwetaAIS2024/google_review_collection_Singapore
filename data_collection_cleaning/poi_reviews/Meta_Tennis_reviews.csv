Ariel Soh,5,"I’ve been learning tennis with Meta Tennis since 2023 as a total beginner and it’s been such a positive experience! Coach Anthony is super patient and encouraging - he breaks down the basics in a way that’s easy to understand, which really helped me build a good foundation.

Over time, I’ve improved my basic tennis skills like my swing, footwork and overall coordination. The sessions are well-paced and I always leave feeling like I’ve learned something new.

Booking is also super convenient and fuss-free, which makes it easy to stay consistent. Highly recommend Meta Tennis to anyone looking to pick up tennis in a fun and supportive environment!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113032514310080138863/reviews
