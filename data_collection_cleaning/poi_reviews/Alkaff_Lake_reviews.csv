Cherie,5,"Came here during the evening and clocked a 1 hour trail here.. Nice lake with some nature trails if you walk away from the lake. Trail was great and it did not feel like it was nestled among the residential area. For a moment , I thought I was in a hiking trail haha.

Great way to destress and glad we came by. Second time here and still enjoyed the walks. Inside repellent is a must. Toilets are available too!! Plus point.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113853230443245909681/reviews

Keng Cheong Tan,5,Very pretty lake with a nice breeze. Good for a walk any time of the day. Just note that the park is still in the final stages of construction so not all is accessible yet. Many young families frequent this place so watch out for the kids tooâ€¦,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102762619432424724330/reviews
