Linda Tan,2,"Came down for a medical check-up request by Employer. However, I felt a bad experience, especially for urine tests. The toilet hygiene needs to improve or separate the ladies and gents. The ECG room was terrible too. Don't know how many people are lying on the ""black"" pillow. Is the ECG device sterilized before use? Anyway, I have no choice because it was arranged by Employer. I hope the improvement can be done.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117398381539665222749/reviews
SEM,5,"I had the privilege of visiting this clinic for a health check while applying for a position as an Auxiliary Police Officer with AETOS. The professionalism and dedication of Dr. Saiful Nizam and his team were nothing short of exceptional. Recently, after sustaining an injury from a fall, I sought Dr. Saiful's expertise once again. His meticulous care and skillful stitching accelerated my recovery beyond expectations. Dr. Saiful's unwavering commitment to his patients is truly inspiring. I am deeply impressed and wholeheartedly recommend this extraordinary doctor to anyone seeking top-notch medical care. Thank you Dr Saiful! Thank you!❤️",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112132853560268426128/reviews
