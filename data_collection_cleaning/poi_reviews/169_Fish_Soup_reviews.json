      "text": "Hit up 169 May Fish Soup at Bukit Panjang for a satisfying early Sunday lunch. There was a short queue that moved quickly. I opted for the double fish soup with rice ($4.50 + $0.50), adding bitter gourd ($0.50) and extra fried egg floss ($0.50) for a bit more texture.\n\nThe batang fish was fresh, though the slicing was a little irregular. The dory, which I usually avoid, surprised me. It was lightly battered and completely free of any fishy odor. The true highlight, though, was the chili sauce! It had a perfect balance of tang and spice, complementing both the fried and sliced fish beautifully. ¬†The broth itself was a bit lighter than I expected, but luckily, I had the foresight to ask for extra milk, which added a nice richness.\n\nOverall, a decent and satisfying meal. I'll definitely be back to try more items on their menu!",

      "text": "Just simple fish soup. It is decent for the original price however i do find the owner method of up-selling is not as tasteful.\n\nI have encountered owner trying to upsell by advertising that they run out of prawn in the seafood soup and offer replacement with Sliced Fish. (At additional Cost).\nI felt if you have ran out of ingredient, you could replace it with fair cost value instead of up-selling replacement ingredient. The original soup was suppose to be $4 ended up like a $5.5 with the replaced ingredient.\n\nI hope this is not a regular affair. there are better price and friendly hawkers among the competitions.",

That's the owners imagination of double fish soup. One of the worse I've ever had. When asked, he confirmed yes that's how it should be... well ok, I have another place to never go again",
