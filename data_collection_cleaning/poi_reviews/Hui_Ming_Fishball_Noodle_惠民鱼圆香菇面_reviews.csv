WilsonW,5,"When you see the bowl prepared, it immediately reminds you how an old school type looks like. And it didn't disappoint. Well balanced, love the slight stickiness to the well-oiled noodles, shiok fishballs and all. $4 for the one I ordered. Will visit here more often :) Closes on Monday.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113833197345189466261/reviews
Jennifer Kok,5,"Old customer to this stall. Auntie and uncle has been giving quality fishball noodle for ages. You will not feel thirsty after the food. Meaning no msg added.
Love the noodle, the combination is very uniform and tasty. Soup is clear which is good, not salty. Very authentic. Now the price is at $4 but still it is worth it. Good food deserves its calling price. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113130918747238238172/reviews
Joves,4,"Best meepok/fishball noodles in the area and quite possibly in Singapore (in terms of their chili and noodles texture/quality)

2 years later update: Sadly, the prices have increased in 2025, at $4.5 for normal and $6 for the big bowl - ingredients remains the same and much lesser than the usual/average bowl of meepok ‚Ä¶",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106551996393888082568/reviews

Goo Bakmi,4,"Nice old school bcm that brings back memories.  Tasty fish cakes and bouncy fish balls though noodle is a bit too soft for my liking.  Will request for more al dente the next time. Sauce mix is flavourful well mixed and not too vinegary or salty.  Can understand why customers are non stop, craving for that familiar taste.  Come here if you want to know how bcm taste like in the 80s and 90s.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104071409397230107746/reviews
