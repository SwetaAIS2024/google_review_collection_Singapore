marc,5,"When i first joined Potter’s Clay, it was a small class size and hence my teachers were able to quickly find my weaknesses and help me to focus and learn more efficiently, especially during the O level period. They were also very patient when explaining topics and concepts i didn’t understand well and made lessons very engaging and fun :3",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106590848766486593242/reviews

Janet Lee,5,"My boy is PSLE this year and he actually have a big drop during P5 last year. Other than giving more work to practise, I decided to let him go  Dunn Dunn learning style consultation by Dr Darren Chua. From here, I will get to know what actually suit him, example like environment, the best attitude of learning etc. Together with this, easier as a parent to guide too. Will get my younger so to do the same soon. I really hope that I can know this much earlier, this can be start as early as P1. Thank you Dr Darren Chua!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101852843285020584197/reviews
