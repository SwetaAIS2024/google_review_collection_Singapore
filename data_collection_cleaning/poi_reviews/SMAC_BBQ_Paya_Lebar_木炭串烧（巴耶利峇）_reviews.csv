MC,5,"This place is always my go-to when I‚Äôm craving BBQ skewers. The meat is cooked perfectly and well-seasoned. The prices are very reasonable, offering great value for the quality. They also provided free ice cream after the meal, which we thought was a nice and thoughtful touch.

The service is consistently good and I love that they offer both indoor and outdoor seating. Lately, I‚Äôve been leaning toward the outdoor seating‚Äîit‚Äôs pet-friendly, so our furry boy gets to join us while we dine. It‚Äôs an excellent place for a relaxing weekend! Ideal for unwinding and savoring some quality time in a peaceful, quiet neighborhood.

Favourites : Grilled Pomfret, Grilled Chicken , potato slice, lamb, and bacon wrapped enoki skewers, bean curd strips, eggplant with garlic and minced pork.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115334096318221690239/reviews
Skye Cai,2,"Tried the barbecue but was quite disappointing.
The barbecue sticks are not charcoal barbecued. It‚Äôs more like electrical barbecued.
Items are fresh. But they are spreader with yellow ginger oil and it has a strong curry taste, which is not original Chinese style.
The small lamb meat looks portioning small, but the meat are crispy at the outer, soft at the inner.
The best is the fried cabbage, very soft and juicy.
Love the environment, it‚Äôs amazing and very fashion.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Kim Jun Hong,4,"First time trying out this hidden gem located in a small mall at a quiet corner of Upper Paya Lebar Road.

‚≠êÔ∏è Service: The service here is excellent‚Äîpolite, friendly, and welcoming. Staff greeted me with smiles upon entering, which gave a warm and pleasant first impression.

üçΩÔ∏è Ambience: The restaurant is open until 2 am and offers both indoor and outdoor seating. While the place isn‚Äôt very big (about 12 tables in total), the indoor seating was particularly nice with strong air conditioning and clean tables. It‚Äôs perfect for a late-night dining experience in a cozy setting.

üí≤ Prices: The prices are reasonable considering the quality of food served. It felt like great value for the taste and portion sizes.

üßëüèª‚Äçüç≥ Food: The food here is fantastic! I enjoyed every single item I ordered. My personal favorites were the Grilled Lotus Root, Grilled Potato Chips, Edamame, Grilled Eggplant, every other grilled meats, and Enoki Mushroom in tin foil. But the real standout was the Grilled Beef with Soy Sauce‚Äîtender, flavorful, and almost like eating sirloin steak! Every dish was well-seasoned and fresh, making it a delight for my taste buds.

‚úÖ Areas for Improvement:
- The food takes a while to be served, although it‚Äôs cooked fresh, which is a plus.

- Only chopsticks were provided. Having forks and spoons available would be more convenient.

- It would be great if they offered both Spicy and Non-Spicy options for the dishes. Currently, everything I ordered was spicy, and a bit more flexibility would cater to different taste preferences.

Overall, it‚Äôs a highly recommended spot for late-night eats. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115322490341831324881/reviews
Lai Kuan,5,"Our 2nd time here. The food here is delicious, and so far, those we have tried, we are delighted with the taste and sauce.

We chose CNY Eve; come by here for your New Year's Eve dinner is a wise choice. Get to choose what we like, and no need to go to the usual Chinese Restaurants to force ourselves to take set meal.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113420734450615215661/reviews
