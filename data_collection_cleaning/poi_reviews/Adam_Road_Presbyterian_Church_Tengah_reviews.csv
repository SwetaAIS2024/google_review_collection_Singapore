Santo Thie,5,"A very biblical teaching with pastors emphasising on reference to bible verse and contexts. Structural teaching too that covers 4 books of scripture within a year and 2 topical themes in between. Strong discipleship group too for bible study for adults, and children church for kids. They also have a program for youth (secondary schools, poly and university students).",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106867379645545465974/reviews
T. C,1,"Strange time we are living in....True Christianity is diminishing in Singapore. Contact this church 6 months ago and gave indepth introduction of my Christian background and none got back to me. Love, Christlike acceptance no longer displayed in Singapore.

Benjamin Yam,5,"Nice new building. A lot of space and comfortable on Sundays. During weekdays, the space is used by school children to hangout and study. There is also a coffee ministry where trained baristas can serve coffee at certain times.

Need to park next door at public multi story carpark which is free on Sunday. If coming other times, there might be carpark in the building",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109350349739357696303/reviews
