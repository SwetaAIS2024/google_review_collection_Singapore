This is one of my favourite “Cai Fan” food stall within Bukit Batok, freshly cook, lots of choices, online payment by PayLah.

Location in Eightways Coffeeshop, within Good View estates, direct access from shelter multi storey car park.

Walking distance to HometeamNS Bukit Batok & Bukit Batok Driving Center, opposite Swiss Cottage Secondly School.

Passed by & came here for lunch.
The stall operator was raising his voice to an elderly folk because of hearing problem, i guessed he can be more patient towards elderly folk who is trying to select low budget item, indecisive of his choice of dishes.

This is poor in selling, because most of the “Cai Fan” stalls are not equipped with pricing of each dishes, and they like to “push “ the customer by saying “ what’s next “, pressing customer to decide what they wanted.

Do hope the consumer association can do something about it: ensure all items had price indicator, so that customer can make their budget choices .",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104017026296774707444/reviews
