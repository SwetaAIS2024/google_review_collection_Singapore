The aunties working there was very friendly and nice and they helped me when i was lost cos idk what to do and i also made many many mistakes. But the toilet there cannot make it. The toilet very dirty and only have like 1 sitting toilet. It also is very tiring and boring because u have to do the same thing everyday, for 8 hours, and my back now very pain.  But i ok with the job.\nAbout toilet breaks or what, some said tat cannot go toilet but not true leh the ppl keep going toilet and no one scold. Also there is a 15min break in the morning.",

      "text": "If youre a part timer, your time here is gonna be hell. The full timers are very rude, they dont even explain instructions to u properly and will scold u for not knowing how to work even if its your first day.\n\nSafety is also not taken seriously at all. Full timers wearing slippers, no proper PPE issued when handling hot items and guess what, i burnt my hand as the glove they gave me wasnt even meant for heat protection lol.\n\nWorked for 3 days only and I have decided to serve my 3 days notice period. I witnessed many part timers quitting after the first few days here lol. If youre a student like me aged between 16-22, they gonna make u do their jobs.",
