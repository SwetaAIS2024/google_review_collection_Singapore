Went there this afternoon to buy the tank set for $32 since I signed up as a member, and there was a huge variety of fishes and other marine life. Many different kinds of food, tanks, and pumps/filters available!  Staff were laid back and friendly, and assisted us in signing up to be a member for cheaper prices. Will definitely go there again if I need anything for my terrapin and betta.",

All my other fish of the same species from elsewhere still thriving for more than 1 year. They sometimes have unique fish so I enjoy going there to check them out. But the fish health isn't the best. Maybe want to change supplier or learn to take care of fish better.",
