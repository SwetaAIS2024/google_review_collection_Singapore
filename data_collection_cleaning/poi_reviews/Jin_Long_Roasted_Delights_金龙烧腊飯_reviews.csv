Wilson Foo,4,"A decent roast meat stall located in Taman Jurong Shopping Center’s 399 food court. The stall splits into two sections selling both rice, congee and noodles. Protein wise they have roast duck, roast pork, char siew, steam chicken and braised duck.

Ordered roast duck drumstick rice with added roast pork. Portion was decent. The roast pork crackling was still crispy and their fat to lean meat ratio was perfect. Roast duck  was a tad dry for me.

Overall a decent roast meat stall given it’s a one stop shop for all your roast meat, chicken and braised duck cravings.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263857328212431619/reviews
