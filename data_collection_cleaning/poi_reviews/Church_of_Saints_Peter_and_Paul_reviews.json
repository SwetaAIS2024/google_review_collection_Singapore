The lay ministers were incredibly kind and welcoming, especially toward my restless toddler, who was running around before the service began. The priest delivered a meaningful and heartfelt homily. Overall, the church had a warm and inviting atmosphere, making us feel truly welcome.",

It is easily accessible with the Bras Basah MRT station just a stone's throw away.\nThe altar is amazing to behold and a such a holy place to celebrate the Eucharist.\nThe Priests and Altar boys celebrated the Mass reverently and the choir sang with angelic voices, both in English and Latin hymns.\nAbundant use of myrrh and frankincense helped to create a most serene and holistic ambience as we worshipped and lifted our prayers & petitions up to heaven.\n\nHighly recommended to anyone who seeks peace, serenity and calm in their lives. Come and let Jesus share in your burdens and offer you rest, for his yoke is light.",
