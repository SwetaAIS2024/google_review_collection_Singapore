I requested for breast meat but it was sold out so I was told to wait about 10+ minutes for them to fry a new batch of chicken breast for me. The wait wasn't too long and the buzzer start ringing at around 10-12 minutes time.\nFried chicken was very good, very old-school taste! Rice has a bit of garlicky taste and it's very fragrant!",

Situated just beside Alexandra food village, it’s their first outlet serving chickens in delicious batter made by their own recipe. Went on their first day and it’s agreeable that the queue was long. But buzz word do travel very fast. Purchased their promo $3 for 4 piece chickens. Their batter is very nice and moist, not greasy and can last long when take away. The menu is very simple and easy to order. Definitely worth the visit to dine in or takeaway. But do factor the waiting time.",

Agree with the tag line on the signboard - deliciously succulent crunchy and crispy fried chicken.\n\nPrice is a little steep if you opt to get the individual pieces. It would have been great if they could have a bundle/bucket/party set price of x number of pieces.",
