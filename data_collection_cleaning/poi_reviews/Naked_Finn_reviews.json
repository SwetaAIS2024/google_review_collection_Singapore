Had the default dinner set which at first I thought was a little short but ended up very full.\n\nReally enjoy the donabe and squid pancake tho! All the rest was very pleasant too, think for the price range defo a visit. Will wanna try their ala carte next time, saw fish being served and looks really good.",

In summary, food is deliciously crafted.\n• my favourite dish was the Dungeness crab with chwee kueh.\n• the deep fried soon hock with curry is also a very good second. The meet was tender and juicy, with a crispy exterior.",

      "text": "The food at Naked Finn was generally enjoyable, though the lunch menu felt somewhat limited with only about four main course options. I opted for the claypot rice, which was expertly cooked with a delightful crispy rice layer and flavorful fish.\n\nThe sharing plate of squid pancake was a delicious and flavorful choice. However, I found the prawn cakes to have an overly sweet flavor that wasn't to my liking.\n\nThe restaurant itself seemed rather empty during my lunch visit, creating a slightly cold and echoey atmosphere.",
