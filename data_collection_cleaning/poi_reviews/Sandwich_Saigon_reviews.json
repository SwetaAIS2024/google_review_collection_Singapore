My first order was the cold noodles with mushrooms, worth trying. And then had sticky rice the day after. Never go wrong with these options. Perfect for even non-vegetarians. Sandwich Saigon is now becoming my fav place.",

Even my meat loving husband enjoyed his vegan meat burger here.\n\nOrdered their standard chicken bahnmi which was great! The bread was nicely toasted, crunchy yet still soft and nicely balanced with the vegetables.\n\nTheir spring rolls are also really good!!\n\nDefinitely recommend this place.",

      "text": "Hole in the wall outlet that dishes out affordable Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi), coffees and noodle dishes.\n\nThis is a great option if you are a vegan too as they have a separate vegan menu.\n\nWe were looking for a quick bite when we were in the area and decided to head down here. There are 2 outdoor tables whilst the inside seating area was around 70% full on a Friday evening.\n\nYou go to the counter, collect your order number/QR and place your order through the QR. Then, collect the order and pay when your number is up.\n\nWe ordered the following -\n\n1) Pork meatball banh mi - Ordered this with extra omelette and cheese. Love how crunchy the bread is, not soft and cold like some versions we found in Hanoi. The quantity of meat is just ok, adding the omelette and cheese makes a big difference.\n\n2) Drip coffee (hot) - Strong Vietnamese coffee. However, they served the condensed milk separately. I prefer the condensed milk at the bottom of the mug, so it mixes better with the coffee.\n\n3) Lychee Yogurt Drink - Cool drink for a warm evening.",

The summer roll is fresh but it’s dipping sauce failed me a little . There are too much fresh greens in the mixed noodle .\n\nOverall nice place but abit expensive.",
