Sihan Goi,4,"Had dinner and drinks here on a Friday night. It started out not so crowded during dinner time, and we were able to get a seat. Had the Katsu sand and a burger. Both were pretty decent. Drinks were OK as well. Service was very good, and atmosphere was quite chill, at least while we were there.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101606206460809087168/reviews
Joyce Lim,5,"Love their What Side cocktail, burger and fries. Was there twice recently, first time was Wednesday ladies night with a female friend. The female service staff kept a lookout for us and came over to ask if we were ok a few times, esp when there was a group of folks that shared our table and was standing quite close to us 2 ladies. What Side tasted better the first time I ordered it. Love the vibe at 10+pm. At 7pm it's dining patrons. Vibe gets better at 9pm. Wonder why people don't party earlier. Easy to get Grab right outside at midnight.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114306834103372851451/reviews
Wedda Dumadag,5,"If you‚Äôre looking for good vibes, great food, and solid drinks, Employees Only is definitely the place to be.

I‚Äôve been here a few times and the music, the crowd, and yes‚Äîeven the free soup‚Äînever disappoint. On my most recent visit, we were lucky to be assisted by Trisha, who was incredibly warm and accommodating. Despite the place being packed, she managed to get us a table and took care of us with a smile.

Service was top-notch. Highly recommend EO to anyone visiting Singapore who‚Äôs looking for a great night out!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109526815581907220965/reviews
Raymund Cee,5,"It‚Äôs a must-go-to bar in SG. The atmosphere and the drinks are superb. (I so love the mysterious entrance door) üòÖ

What truly made the night memorable, however, was the warm welcome and attentive service from Trisha. From the moment we arrived, she made us feel right at home with her genuine smile and thoughtful hospitality.

A huge shoutout to Trisha for setting the tone and making the evening feel special. She‚Äôs a true asset to the team. The experience was great because of her.ü©∑ü•∞ Will surely recommend Employees Only to my friends visiting SG. üòÅ‚ò∫Ô∏è",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108567900475914677195/reviews
Shanru,5,"Visited a while ago and just got around to posting my review. Went on Fourth of July accidentally (I‚Äôm American) and they had fun USA-themed drinks/dishes as well as decor and dress code (employees were wearing flip flops, wifebeaters, etc.) I thought their decoration was, at the time, very funny (see pictures). Unfortunately, considering current circumstances, they did not age well. Overall super fun experience ‚Äî would definitely visit again, especially for special events.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114376781286826259183/reviews
