Overall: 5/5 Stars

Paradise Classic at Punggol Coast Mall exceeded expectations! Donkey & I, initially planned to dine at Aston due to a promotional offer, the long queue steered us towards Paradise Classic, and we're so glad it did. We ordered a delightful selection: Carlsberg beer, crispy prawn rolls, braised prawn broth hor fun, and prawn-infused ebiko fried rice. The hor fun was a standout, boasting a delicious ""wok hei"" flavour that I thoroughly enjoyed. Donkey's fried rice was also a hit, particularly when mixed with the provided sambal belacan chili. The overall dining experience was enhanced by the top-notch service provided by the restaurant staff.

The ambiance at Paradise Classic is warm and inviting, with a design that blends modern comfort with a nod to traditional Singaporean aesthetics. The restaurant's décor incorporates nostalgic imagery of old Singapore, creating a charming and familiar atmosphere. Comfortable seating adds to the overall pleasant dining experience. It's a nice balance of modern and traditional, making it suitable for a wide range of diners.

While slightly pricier than average, the quality of the food and service at Paradise Classic makes it a worthwhile dining destination. Highly recommended!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews
