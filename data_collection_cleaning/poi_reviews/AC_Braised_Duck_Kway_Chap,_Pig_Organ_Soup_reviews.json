The small intestines are clean, no strong smell or taste quite shiok actually. The broth is slightly dark with a nice savoury kick, and the duck is solid and goes super well with the kway chap. Prices still quite\nreasonable, nothing to complain. Got plenty of parking just beside the coffeeshop, so very convenient. But seating really very limited, so better come early if you don‚Äôt want to wait long.",

      "text": "Enjoyed a comforting Kway Chap ($5.70) featuring silky rice sheets in a herby, savoury dark soup with braised pork belly, intestine, beancurd, and a boiled egg.\n\nThe pork belly was tender, though slightly porky, and the intestine was well-cleaned with no smell. The braised items had a balanced flavour, not too sweet or salty. Generous kway portion, with fragrant garlic oil enhancing the dish. Still as delicious as remembered!",

The duck has the right texture, the intestine is well prepared without stripping away the taste intestine has.\nSoup is flavourful to fill with the right hint of herbs and soy making it a wonderful side!\nChilli offering has an array and it compliment the food nicely.\nSat together with another customer eating Kway Chap and notice that the Kway is well prepared and affirm on its springiness. üëçüëç\nWill Definately return if around the neighbourhood!",
