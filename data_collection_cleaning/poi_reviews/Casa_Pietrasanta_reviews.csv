Mervyn Phea,5,"Simplified fine dining in the west. This place is a pleasant surprise. An almost exclusive dinning restaurant with only 4 tables. This means you get carefully curated menu, food quality and a nice environment to dine & chill in. Reservations highly recommended. Would liked to have taken more photos but it was a business lunch. 3 course meal on a weekday was the best choice. The mushroom soup starter is so exquisite and creamy, a must to try. Kudos to the Chef.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116896247741921212083/reviews

Yan Ting Hee,5,"Had my anniversary dinner with my husband on a Monday night. Small restaurant with a nice homely and cozy feel. Every dish was so fresh, balanced and delicious, it's so hard to pinpoint a favorite! Even the mango sorbet was so good? But the highlight was definitely the pesto gnocchi pasta for me cos it tastes so different from what I was used to. I'll definitely be back again! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòã",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104437880682433863636/reviews

Colette Tan,3,"For the price (about 90 per pax after tax), i thought the food was quite mediocre.

Tuna Tartare - the truffle oil didn't quite go with the rest of the dish and the pistachios didn't add anything either.
Zuppa - a bit too tart, but a good amount of seafood.
Pomfret - I felt the sauce was also too tart and a bit too thick.
Beef - this was cooked well
Pistachio ice cream cake - this is just ice cream with  a very thin sponge at the bottom. The ice cream has a nice buttery flavour but the pistachio flavour was weak.
Tiramisu - too much cocoa powder, and the coffee flavour was too strong.

It's quite a small place, but the ambience is ok. Quiet and peaceful.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112297245669411174670/reviews
