      "text": "We finally made it to Gink-Go after some early morning trail running at  MacRitchie Reservoir. Opening at 7.30am this cozy little cafe serves up nice kopi and for vegans the cup of humus with carrot and cucumber sticks is a good treat. We also got the Japanese curry with veggies and rice and that was delicious. Next time we will try some of the pasta dishes.\n\nThere is a small air-conditioned room that can accommodate about ten people, if that is full there are many nearby benches etc. to sit and enjoy the food.\n\nService is very good and friendly",

We had the curry, banana muffin and the brownie and all of it was delicious! I like how they say they only use olive oil and no added sugar - great little place, definitely recommend for a little food break.",

For those who like the unadulterated life, the mild flavours pair really well with nature's beauty.\n\nThe intentionality and care taken to formulate the menu and compose the ingredients is evident.\n\nThanks for looking after your customers",
