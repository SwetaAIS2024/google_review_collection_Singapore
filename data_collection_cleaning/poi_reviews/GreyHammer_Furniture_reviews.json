      "text": "Kris is really great at customer service :) She was very patient and meticulous in explaining while we were browsing. My mum and I came back to her after a month of browsing other stores, largely because of her. We felt comfortable making our purchase through her with the advice she gave from our first visit üëçüèª We faced a delay with the delivery of our murlo quartz table top but Kris was assuring and responsive to our questions, which helped allay frustration. They kindly loaned a beautiful oak table top too, while we waited.\n\nThe delivery guys were also some of the best I‚Äôve seen :) They were really tested to figure out how to orientate the table legs to get through our narrower-than-usual front door. But they were quite patient and didn‚Äôt get visibly frustrated. They were also respectful of the house and brought protective mats.\n\nWe‚Äôre happy with our table. The chosen veining of the quartz is lovely. The table fits just right in the space, which in part was due to the detailed discussions with Kris regarding making the right colour choices and design. Thank you so much :)",

Her product range is often unique here in Singapore and always well made with great attention to detail in the craftsmanship. The prices are very modest too for the quality which makes her an excellent place to go to when fitting out a house be it owned! The furniture will be items I will keep as their style is timeless.",
