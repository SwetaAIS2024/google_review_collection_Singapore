The soup was surprisingly light and flavourful! Cabbage was nicely stir fry while retaining crunch! Acha was nice and tangy. ‚ÄúSteam chicken‚Äù was tender, smooth and savoury to bite. Rice was nicely cooked and firm! I enjoyed my meal a lot and it was really a decent vegetarian chicken rice! Stall lady was polite and friendly!",

Fear of a stomach upset due to the vendor unclean way of treating food.\n(It was a china lady)\n\nBut if it was a different vendor making it.  I would probably come again.\n\nThe auntie was cooking 2 hardboil eggs with their shell in the water that was meant to cook my wanton noodles. I don know if she washed the egg shell before dumping into the boiling water. Eggs are not exactly clean and sometimes with faeces.",

The mock chicken tasted so real that I had to check the sign to make sure it was actually vegetarian! Really close to the real thing. Highly recommend this place for a solid veggie curry fix!",

For the nasi lemak do give their deluxe version a try, good review from non-veg friend.",
