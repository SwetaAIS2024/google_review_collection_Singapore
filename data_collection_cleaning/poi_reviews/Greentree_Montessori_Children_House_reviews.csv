Amitanand Aiyer,5,"We are very happy with our son's experience at PMI ! The caring and dedicated teachers create a nurturing environment where each child feels valued and supported. It's a joy to see the children so happy and engaged in their activities, which are thoughtfully designed to promote all-around development. Thanks a lot to Dr. Khoo for leading this!

One of the standout features of PMI-Westlake is its wonderful location in the midst of nature. The children go on delightful walks to the nearby McRitchie Reservoir, allowing them to explore and appreciate the outdoors while learning about the natural world. School also plans events and other trips to farms/parks within Singapore few times a year. This truly enriches their educational experience.

We are grateful for the positive and holistic approach taken by PMI, and happy to recommend it to parents looking for a place where their children can thrive holistically.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103619976776050322911/reviews
