Well stocked and conveniently located next to the Clementi MRT station. The place has one counter manned by a staff and two self checkout out counters, for checking out your purchases.",

Absolutely worse customer experience I've had in a while, the shop at the front selling the 生煎包 literally shouted at me for a good minute just because I was no longer buying anything from their store. Such uncouth and gangster actions from the male employee. Will never buy from them again. Absolutely disgusting behavior.\n\nThe food from the image comes from the other shop deeper  into Scarlett market. Highly recommend them , friendly service staff, and even provided additional service to ask & pack everything nicely. The food is really good, bigger portion as well and more affordable.",

This is the Chinese version of Don Don Donki where you literally can find most food items that’s manufactured in China. There was a live station as well selling cooked food like dumplings and Chinese dishes. We bought a number of these to try at home as there was no seatings within.",
