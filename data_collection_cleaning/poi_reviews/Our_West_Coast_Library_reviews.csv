Clay,1,"WASTE ELECTRICITY! GRC is too rich

Visited on 27 Aug 24, the air con was blasting in the library even though no passioncard library members were inside.

Even if a resident wanted to enter the underutilised library, you must be a paying Passioncard member, and wait for weeks for the membership to be processed before you can enter the library.

This kind of wasteful and exclusive pattern should be discouraged, and more of us should write in to complain to our MP for added effect.

The CC should either publicise the library to all to make the electricity usage worth, or switch off until some resident signs in.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106576289478338243997/reviews
Feng Yi,5,"Small, cozy community library! Facilities are new , desktops are 100% touchscreens, resources are all online, overall a conducive place to do some reading! There is also an area for children to read/play/chill, there is also quite a big selection of kids's books! Remember to register for library membership using your PAssion card! Processing time for me, took 7 seven days. After which just tap your PAssion card to enter the library! If you don't have a PAssion card, you can easily register at the CC counter, but processing time for the card would take some time though.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101556457243283101548/reviews
YT Lee,1,"On Saturday of May 21, I tried to visit the library the first time.  It was not accessible to the public unless a person has gone to the adjacent community centre to submit an application to gain entry using Passion card, and wait for 2 weeks to process.  Such requirement is unique as far as I know on libraries in Sgp.  Such requirement was not found in its FB or web portal for the public.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107228443867556619295/reviews
Alvin Wong,1,"Only passion card holders can use the ‚Äònlb‚Äô library, and thats after you registered in person at the office. The bummer is that the bespectacled guy in office claim I can only use it when they have ‚Äòapprove‚Äô my application after 2 weeks üëèüèªüòûtotally defeated the purpose of a community center to serve residents living nearby",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108593570260575105953/reviews
