      "text": "Review is about Mc Donald condiment change. Ever since they change the butter packaging, the quality and recipe seems to deteriorated. I won't even think of paying 50 cents extra for such poor quality tasting whipped butter.  The taste of butter is artificial and fat content reduced tremendously,  feels like ingesting synthetic butter. The look of the butter also feels weird. Overall experience affected if the butter quality do not improve.  Cost cutting is essential but not to the extend of affecting the quality so much. I doubt Mc Donald will take out reviews seriously given so many people still patronise them despite drop in standard.",

Luckily dinner service was not too crowded.\n\nOrdered the Smoky BBQ Chicken set and the potato pops are scattered everywhere. We were also given only 2 napkins / serviettes. Wonder why they are so stingy with it.\n\nThe fries are also only lukewarm at best. Might be slow moving due to the low traffic hence they didn’t make fresh fries.",

Breakfast food is decent but buns could have been hotter. Table service is very quick. Cleanliness can be better tho. Also Ezlink at self ordering kiosk not working",

      "text": "Ordered at 1230. Table service. Finally collected instead at 110pm. Food really takes a bit of time. But maybe it's new and not as efficient yet. Food is the same as all other McDonald's. Seems like a bit of a power trip issue here. It happened while we were waiting for food so we were worried that our food would be overlooked. Reminded the counter staff. If in a rush, not a place to go to until they sort things out.\nBeautifully designed and nice place if service can keep up.",
