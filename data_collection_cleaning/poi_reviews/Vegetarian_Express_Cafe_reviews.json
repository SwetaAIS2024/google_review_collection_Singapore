      "text": "Update 8 Nov 24\nBrightened atmosphere now with new lighting. Food just as good. Staff seem happier too.\n\nBought some snacks from the counter - the Pumpkin Cracker from Malaysia is superb $4 and the Monkey Head Mushroom floss from Taiwan $7 is good too (but I couldn‚Äôt see the use by date on the packaging)\n\nUpdate 2 Jan 24\nFantastic dinner with ‚Äúfish‚Äùcurry and ‚Äúchicken‚Äù rice (they ran out of the chicken rice but we totally enjoyed the unpolished rice option!)\n\nThere was a notice to seek support for price increase due to rental increase. The shop lease expires Nov 24. Support! Support!! I hope they will endure and  stay on!\n\nCash, nets and paylah accepted!\n\nUpdate 28 Aug 23\n\nMonday 530pm. Called to order for self pick up. When I arrived after 10 min, it was ready!!!\nThe food is still as reliable as ever.\n\nWe had for $31.60:\n1. fish curry is 5/5 looks fierce but not that spicy, just spicy enough!\n2. Luo Han Zhai - think it‚Äôs the best 5/5. Vege is adequately crunchy yet cooked to soak jn the delicious sauce.\n3. Olive fried rice - the rice was slightly lumpy and could be dryer.\n\nPaid by pay now on-site (other options: nets or cash)\n\n2 years ago:\nCan‚Äôt believe I haven‚Äôt reviews this cafe! Probably cos I don‚Äôt want people crowding the already crowded space. These guys are simply great!!!!\n\nSuper reliable in quality and can eat in Aircon comfort. But there is limited seating so if u are late u can wait.\n\nVery popular dishes which run out early - chicken rice, vegetable curry (all the curry dishes are popular!)",
