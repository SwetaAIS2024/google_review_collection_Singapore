Chan “Toffees” Allen,3,"Ordered the $7 sambal petal with minced meat rice. (as shown in the display photos)
However, there was no egg when the food was served.. The staff said no eggs after 5pm. This was cheating!
It was not mentioned when I placed the orders and it was not stated in the display as well. It stated ""add egg for $1 after 5pm"" My first and last time eating here.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110097176985965725951/reviews
