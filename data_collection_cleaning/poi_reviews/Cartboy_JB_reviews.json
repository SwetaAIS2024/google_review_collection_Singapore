Not many choices for drinks or snacks. They only had fries and pasta when I went. Would be great if they could add more side dishes like cakes or curry puffs.\n\nIf they had shisha, it’d be even better! Definitely a nice spot to relax, just hoping to see more variety in the future.",

They serve food too, though it would be helpful to have a display showing what’s available. I wanted to order something, but the staff mentioned there would be a bit of a wait not advisable. so I ended up just having coffee. Would I return? Possibly not, if it only for the ambiance.\n\nReplying to Cartboy:\nHi Cartboy, thank you for responding to my review! I really appreciate it. I hope you’ll be able to keep improving and be well-prepared for more customers in the future. It’s such a great spot to relax, and look forward to seeing more positive reviews in future.",
