      "text": "Used to visit the old Clementi outlet back in schooling days. Was appalled at the service we received on 2/5/25. Chinese lady staff at the counter was rude and arrogant, and downright malicious to customers. She ignored my group initially and subsequently talked down to us, even barking orders as though we were her employees. I am puzzled as to why such a great establishment would leave a customer-facing role to an employee with such an unseemly attitude. Sad to see how this place has changed, will definitely not be visiting again.",

      "text": "Pros: This billard room has a very interesting atmosphere with a small little restaurant complimenting the multiple pool and snooker tables that they have. The center also includes multiple restaurants a bowling alley and a gaming cafe if you want to mix it up.\n\nCons: Sometimes when I have told my friends about this place they would have a hard time finding the building and the billard room itself. So remember to describe specifically the location of the place when recommending the place.",
