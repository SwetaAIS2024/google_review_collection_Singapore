Chee Sergi Junn Yeow,5,"Ordered nasi lemak with crispy chicken wing and tofu with chyepoh. Flavourful, good portion. Service was alright but the philipino cashier like woke up on the wrong side of her bed this morning ðŸ˜‚ nice deco, very old school kopitiam style.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113577747866543961404/reviews
Lyn Cai,4,"The traditional curry chicken was tender and well seasoned while the curry sauce was thick and creamy. Definitely recommended if you were to visit curry times. Thereâ€™s an option to get noodles or rice with the curry. The type of noodles used was similar to instant noodles which was a comforting choice when paired with the curry. But personally, rice might suit the curry better as it can absorb the sauce and bring out the spices from the curry better.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107853084419005618803/reviews
Botak,3,"The good thing about the cafe was that it was air-conditioned and not too crowded, though the food was not too unusual, it was not that bad in taste

The signature bread was slightly sweet, so it was a bit different when I used it as the bread to dip with the curry.

Would recommend only if u can't think of anything else to eat or wish to eat light.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100060791396189603978/reviews
L L,3,"I dined here during dinner and ordered through the QR code. Unfortunately, there wasn't an option to select iced drinks. The food arrived quickly, but I wasn't a fan of the fried tofu skin in the curry or the accompanying bread. However, the curry chicken and teh o peng were both delicious. I appreciate the service provided by the staff!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112783414876414905670/reviews
Lydia W,5,"I eaten here many times since 2018 and their food is consistently good. Had the curry beef with rice set for $15.5 which came with a drink and side. The portions are generous and the beef is tender. The curry is the best. Incredibly tasty and very drinkable. The fried bean curd skin and curry leaves add a delightful texture.

I've also tried their prata, nasi lemak and fried noodles before. All good. I especially love thier curry buns. There is a reason why this restaurant always has a long queue at lunchtime. Quality food at reasonable prices and fast service.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114298584666245829355/reviews
