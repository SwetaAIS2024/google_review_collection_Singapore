The ordering and payment processes were smooth and seamless via emails and electronic payments. The deliveries were always on time. The food was tasty with ample portions based on the number of people to be fed and the price has been reasonable. Will surely be going back to them again. Well done Kate's Catering!",

My boss and colleagues liked the food quality, they even asked for the website to consider for their future personal gatherings.\n\nDelivery is on time. Always 30mins before eating time. Communication is fast both by email and WhatsApp. Everything was smooth.",

Portion is generous and packed tidily and the guests enjoyed the vegetarian prawn fritters and sweet sour fish dish.\nOnly problem we encountered is that the fried tofu in the braised tofu dish tastes sour and spoilt, so most of us avoided that dish and spit out the tofu on the first bite.\nOther than that unfortunate dish, it was a pleasant experience overall.",
