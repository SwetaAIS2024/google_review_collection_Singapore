D,3,"The auntie manning this outlet is very friendly.

Sadly, the food is a disappointment.

Broth is ehhh.
80% is noodles (large quantity)
10% is soup (not that flavourful tbh)
10% is beef meatball and random bits of meat

Spiciness is decent. Tom yam doesnâ€™t taste like tom yam sadly.

Spring rolls are good though, can recommend that.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109582372637282122769/reviews
Andy,5,"I enjoyed the Beef Soup Noodle (#4) here very much. Kway teow was nicely cooked and springy. Broth was flavourful, had garlic oil in it, and there was a slight acidity which delightfully cut through the richness of the broth. Noodles very generously and vibrantly topped with fresh kangkong & parsley. Good portion of beef as well.

For just $5.30, this is a steal. I'd gladly pay $10 for a bowl like this. Recommended. Favepay available.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107570888514767745893/reviews
Vinz Beans,4,Nice Tom yum noodles with pork .soup base is quite close to the taste of boat noodle vendors in the victory monument area in Bangkok. Add some chili powder to the springy noodles for a bit of spiciness .the deep fried chicken were average.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100638889270323418843/reviews
Benji T,2,"Taste was normal if you craves for a bobian situation to travel out.
Price could not be justified on the amount of food I'm getting.
Look at the pictures.
Beef balls was halved.
Beef meat was soooo thin.
Chicken wings without the drum.

Beef noodles $6.50
Chicken wings x 4 $5.80
Spring Roll x 4 $3.80",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112371515100976068000/reviews
Atul Bade,4,"Tried Tom yum beef dry noodles. It was flavourful.""chilli"" element had pronounced existence. I asked for it and aunty made sure that I can fathom that much hot food. Recommended in Rivervale Plaza and nearby areas. Won't disappoint you if you looking for for some hot meal.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115693446222296549444/reviews
