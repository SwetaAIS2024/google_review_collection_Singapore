Lei Gan,5,"I been eating this stall 30 yearrs +++ ago when it was at Kembangan. It has recently moved from a nearby coffeeshop to Marine terrace hawker centre.

The food got better! The price got cheaper from $4 and bigger portion!  Super happy

Yea the boss is a little slow. And I got my noodles faster cos I am the first in queue.
He has always been this speed since I can remember.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114783208714918205127/reviews

Zayden Teo,2,"We saw a queue of about 5 pax so decided to give this stall a shot (we should have read the reviews first). It took us about 25 minutes to reach the front of the queue and have our orders taken. That would have been fine if the food was good, however, the standard of the mee pok noodles here are way below average. Noodles were stiff, bland and there was close to no ingredients in the bowl. Highly disappointing experience. Safe to say this would be my first and last time waiting in line for this stall.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117207982971169050764/reviews
Gh Wu,2,"Downright slow, downright normal. I queued about 30mins with 3 customers in front of me. The boss really took his own sweet time with the noodles and everything. If you are in a rush for time, stay away. If you want something better look elsewhere",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115354235833917181188/reviews
Leonard Wee,1,Ridiculously bad. Really really not edible. Madness. Slightly better when it was at the coffee shop nearby that they burned down some years ago now just terrible. Avoid!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116841518027778345489/reviews
