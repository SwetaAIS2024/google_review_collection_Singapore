      "text": "This mall is a rebuilt version of the original Great Eastern Hotel which was at the same location for many years.\n\nAfter redevelopment, it became a mall with lots of hope. Units were sold to individual buyers and the take up was good.\n\nI remember one anchor tenant was a supermarket Ntuc Fairprice. The other is ibis hotel. The supermarket is gone though.\n\nBut the rest of the mall is sparsely tenanted. It's still the same after so many years. Hardly anything there except for some pubs.\n\nThink the rent must be very high perhaps coz the units were sold at very high price.",

      "text": "MacPherson Mall is a small shopping center in Singapore with a mix of shops, food outlets, and services. Visitors appreciate its convenient location near Mattar MRT, ample parking, and air-conditioned environment, making it a pleasant escape from the heat. Some food establishments, like Le ‘Tart, receive praise for their offerings, though the mall’s overall dining options are limited. Many units remain unoccupied, which affects the mall’s vibrancy. Despite its quieter atmosphere, it serves as a local spot for essentials and casual dining. The mall has potential for improvement as new tenants join .",

Everywhere you turn its empty units or business that look like theyve shut down.\n\nRent here is cheap cos the building looks like it was used as a red light district. Dingy atmosphere, stale cigarette smelling air, toilets smell like urine, glass windows caked with dust.\n\nGo here if you want to appreciate what little good you have in your life. Going here made me appreciate my life a whole lot more.",
