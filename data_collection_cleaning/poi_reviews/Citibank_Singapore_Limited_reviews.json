I have 6 banks and they were they only bank who do that to me. They also update the cancellation to the credit bureau resulting me unable to get any loans from any bank forcing me to almost going into bankruptcy.\n\nThankfully i have relative that bail me out of the situation. Otherwise i might lose my job which i am the sole bread winner of. Please dont do any banking with them.",

      "text": "Continue the Citi credit card at your own risk!\n\nIf I can give -5 star review I would go do so!!\nHorrible bank service and customer service! It‚Äôs act like a scammed banker to me!\n\nMy Citi credit card is expired and I do not wish to continue nee Citibank credit card with them, so I wanted to pay for my last statement! However, I have problem log in to the Citi app due to my Citi bank card expired and need to activated the new card to log in.\n\nI had called them a months ago for the last statement and the customer service ask me to activate the new card so that I can view my statement, I express to them I do not wish to continue with  Citi credit card anymore cause of their bad service and irritated by keep calling me ask me turn my statement to loans service with some interest on top of that which I told them I do wish to do so, but they can keep calling a few times although i already expressed I do not want it. The customer service say okay then they will send me the last statement thru mailing to my new address only in 3 to 7 days because they cannot send thru email which is very ridiculous, other bank can send a pdf statement but they cannot to do that! So fine, I waited a month they did not send me.\n\nAfter a month later, they send me email and sms regarding my latest statement without any statement in pdf attached and amount! Hello! I ask me pay for my statement without telling how much? how can I pay? Due to their very irritating phone call customer service that wasting my a lots of time I decide to write in to their email, their email customer service WORSE ask me to activated my new card again or otherwise calling their 6225 5225 customer service and repeating the same things situation again!\n\nThey ask me to activated the new card which I do not want to do so! Cause if I activated it I had to call their customer service to deactivate again!\nI do not want to activated cause this is like hassle for me when comes to deactivating the card! I had a bad experience do not successfully deactivated the card last year which is why I give up and waited for the card expiring! This is sound like a scammed service from their credit card service! So simple things just tell me how much I need to pay and statement send thru email or mailing to me but they cannot to do so, only can do and view on apps! But comes to deactivated the card service they make it like a scam cannot do thru apps need call to their customer service again to wasting my time and vet thru and transfer multiple the calls  to the right customer service which wasting my precious time to do it again! Super frustrated till I really had to express again and again I do not wish to do so and last they agreed to tell me the amount for my last statement with additional late payment charge! So I think they purposely to do so so that they can pile up the late statement or make me forget about it to earn the money from the late payment charge!\nAfter some argument they agreed to waive the charge, but in the meantime they ask me pay full amount and they refund me after that to my new card! Which is sound like they forced me to activated their card! So, to all please sign up Citi credit with your own risk!\n\nWrong story cut short, they agreed they will notify me the arrangement amount thru sms and 2 days later the customer service will call again to tell me the exact amount for the last statement! I shall see and waited what stun they will to do after 2 days!\n\nUpdated: this bank scammer declined my waived cause they still want me activated the card to reflect on the next statement instead, see photos! U guys can continue with them  at your risk!",

      "text": "I had a terrible experience with Citibank when applying for a new credit card. Upon receiving the card, it was immediately hit with fraudulent charges. I followed Citibank's advice to hold off on using it as they issued a replacement card and assured me the fraudulent charges would be reversed. However, this caused me to miss the minimum spend requirement to qualify for the free signup gift. When I reached out to them, they denied the free gift altogether. This is absolutely unacceptable. I trusted their process, and it ended up costing me. Very disappointed with their lack of accountability and poor customer service.",

      "text": "If there are negative stars rating I shall do so!!!!\nThis is the worst credit card company i have worked with despite using their card for more than 2-3 decades! Bank services and support are horrible.\nThere were multiple fradulent charges which i had to call repeatedly months after months.\nAs i have giro, there are excess payments, they never come back on the dispute. Eventually i decided to cancel all 3 cards as every card has overpaid amount. They happily never come back for more than 2 weeks, called again and was told I did not give instructions to refund after cancellation(card cancelled 2nd Sept, today is 16th Sept)???? zzz.. the one disputed transaction card since March with almost $400 excess payment was not cancelled despite instructions to cancel all. Called again and they hold me ransom saying dispute not cleared and I am liable if dispute is not cleared for the fradulent charges. Absolutely disgusted with such services. Pls go to other local banks and even Amex has better services. The cancellation is a pain.. mention Citibank may cancel.... then put you on hold to listen to some messages and repeated same message.. the process of cancellation will take up some time. Only bank that has such time consuming process. While I type this review and completed this , i am still on the call for the cancellation! total 38 mins today excluding all other calls on 28th Aug, 29th Aug, 2nd Sept...zzzz. CS/cancellation team \" Marc, Meg, Car all a pain to speak to.",
