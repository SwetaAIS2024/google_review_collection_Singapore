"Yong Hui, Ronny Tan",4,"+ Good taste.

+ The stall sells both breakfast food (mee rebus), and lunch/ dinner food (nasi padang).

+ Located in quiet hidden corner of the estate. Less hot and expensive compared to the other nearby coffeeshop at 209B Clementi Ave 6.

+ Ample sheltered MSCP parking next door.

- Prices not low with mee rebus starting at $4 but that's unfortunately standard for coffeeshops in new HDB estates nowadays.

- Few other stall options in this coffeeshop if your companions want to try something else.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103854866816776797/reviews
Router,5,"It's a nasi padang eatery but hot d@mn - they have 4 kinds of chili !  (check out my photos)
From nasi lemak sambal type to super hot limey sambal belachan.

The ayam penyet is nice enough (the fried batter is just not as crispy as i would expect), but when u add in the lemak padi gravy, begedil and all 4 types of sambal, the dish is VERY satisfying.

Chili-heads, give this place a try if you are in the neighbourhood.  While i mourn the passing of Ayam Taliwang, this place is an acceptable substitute for a chili fix :)

Update 2024 : they seem to have moved from owning an entire unit at the junction of west coast & clementi road to a hawker stall in clementi ave 6.  Ah well, good while it was nearby :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111110207852418416847/reviews
Brown Potato,5,"Now this is the place where I will compare to, for how good Malay cuisine should be done!

Dishes are distinct from one another in taste, they all compliment each other. Each and every dish also has good depth of flavour, nothing is remotely one-dimensional in taste. The chicken breast was even still moist inside, really surprised me, it was perfect.

Confirm will be coming back again, and maybe again after that also!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109677339078871983256/reviews
JR,5,It’s been a long time since I eat Malay cai fan. It’s so damn good. Aunties gave big portion of ingredients. The clams were spicy and addictive.

C. Tan,4,3 type of chillies self help.  The nasi rice is cooked with fragrance and everything else was almost perfectly done with the chicken lacking a bit of seasoning more. The ikan bilis with fried peanuts was nice.  Our lotong was cooked well with good flavours so was the mee robus.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107094114994477290249/reviews
