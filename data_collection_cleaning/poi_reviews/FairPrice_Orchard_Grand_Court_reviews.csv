Ezekiel Tanjutco,1,"17.10.2024  : 7:32am THURSDAY MORNING

For a morning rush, when everyone is busy doing their weekly grocery shopping, FairPrice Killiney managed it poorly. They closed all self-checkout kiosks and only had one cashier open. This was unacceptable, inconvenient, and a very bad way of managing the store. I urge the top management to please address this issue with the store's floor management.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117152486391144208278/reviews
Wen Dee,5,"MEGA GOOD JOB TO FLORENCE SOO! The one lady mending all automated counters. She is amazing and extremely helpful. Thank you Aunty Florence for your kindness. Fairprice Killiney Road must be lucky have you! There are 5 supermarkets within walking distance, Iâ€™ve always choose to buy from this outlet. Their newly reno is sparkling clean, cozy and spoil for choice. Look forward to my next visit!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108895691353121915191/reviews

K,1,"Extremely disappointing experience at this FairPrice outlet.

The older skinny Asian lady staff is consistently rude and disrespectful towards customers. On multiple visits, I encountered pricing errors, and instead of helping, she reacted with impatience and aggressively yelled to us. This level of poor attitude is hilarious and far below the service standards of other FairPrice locations.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104494290784532414445/reviews
Willennium 2k,3,"Temporary close from 13 March to 5 May 2024 for renovations.
Reopen on 6 May. See notice in photos.
24 hours service. Sometime you may find some unique produce here that other branches don't not stock.
It is also seldom that you will see one other Fairprice from the entrance across, albeit t that one is a Fairprice Finest. 180m away.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110060552833264793514/reviews
