min weiah,5,"Doctors are experienced and receptionist is friendly! Unlike other clinics which require extensive treatments, the doctors here promised a few treatments only would heal my knees. I went a few times only for knee injuries treatments and have seen big improvements! Had sore neck due to tension and sore neck was treated right away in a session. Worth every visits. Would revisit again. Thank you Kanji Physical!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106087122587190404006/reviews

Sanae Ishii,5,"God hands to cure pains and numbness by fixing the alignment of the bones and joints. My back stiffness form scoliosis has been eased as he places my spine in the right alignment.
