Daughter was on the half way line in POA/English but after attending IQ&EQ, she was able to cope and most importantly understand what the tutor was explaining where the others couldn't.  KUDOS to IQ&EQ team !!!  You guys made a big difference and we sincerely thank you for it.  For others considering, don't wait !  IQ&EQ can make the difference (provided your child is willing)",
