D D,2,"I changed 2 screws and let out some air for my brakes. I chose there as its near my office compared to my usual repair shop at Ubi, however honestly I think I got taken for a ride. Total price is 20 over bucks when it's honestly something very simple. Then they mentioned that my fork has some issues, it would cost 200 over dollars. My usual repair shop would be 120. Would nt recommend unless ur in urgent need.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110163247501774483712/reviews
Edd Ong,5,"Needed a quick fix to pass my inspection... I wasn't expecting much but the dude just went into his shop, took out a spare mud guard and started attaching it to my bike... done and pass my re-inspection. S$25 bucks to solve an issue is really worth the price!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117070497186702834898/reviews
thenesh nesh,1,"Went there to change my engine oil and oil filter, mechanic poured the engine oil so full, more than the required amount even after I told him twice. The engine oil was filled to the brim of my motorcycle engine. Mechanic should known that over filling engine oil can cause seizure of water pump and gasket failures.

Never going there again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103968162786935877117/reviews
Samsung Note Edge,1,"This workshop charged me $30 for just a new metallic black rear bike plate but with incorrect / improper alignment and spacing..I requested for acrylic type but they said they didnt have availability for this type and they just simply proceeded to make the metallic plate without confirming with me.
I found out that the other workshops charged $15 for the replacement yet they got it sorted and right. You can try Wing Yap Motor for good services if you are looking for bike rectification nearby.

Also, they did not fix my original headlight properly when it had a missing screw after changing back from the modded headlight which did not pass the inspection at VICOM sin Ming. probably because they asked me if i was going tO VICOM sin Ming so that they could change back to my modded headlight but I ended up going to VICOM kaki Bukit. they said they couldnâ€™t do anything about the missing screw.

Not so Deaf-friendly. They seem to be lacking of knowledge about bike rectification for re-inspection.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107081104572876788231/reviews
M.Aidil.R,5,"Needed a quick fix for my front and rear headlights as I couldn't pass inspection due to rot eating into the plastic.
Came here and they helped, didn't even want to charge me after that.
Will definitely go back there to give them business.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100157625162122129380/reviews
