I came they asked if I had reservation, I said no and they seem to ignore me until I asked where I could sit for drinks. Then they directed me to a high table. The sake was pleasant the food was alright but the tower of asahi was flat. Probably wouldn't come again.",

      "text": "This gem is situated in Koven, and I love how this neighbourhood has quite a few interesting food places, including this cozy izakaya and bar! I love the vibes of this place, been here before, though previously it was for drinks and their salmon sashimi which I find is very reasonably priced, and served in relatively thick slices too! This time round, we were here for dinner and so I ordered a rice bowl with some sides and drinks.\n\nSalmon Chirashi Bowl + Miso Soup ($16)\nMy first time trying their rice bowl. This was substantial (for me), with rather generous portions of salmon and ebiko. Overall, a decent meal!\n\nMiyakanbai Ichigo Strawberry (on the rocks) ($12)\nI've had this before and I fell in love with it, so I'm so glad to have it again! This was so refreshing, sweet and sour, and easy to drink. Really can't taste the alcohol taste (to me), and I love the fruity taste so much!\n\nCheese Mentaiko Scallop ($6.80 per piece)\nThis was some cheesy goodness, and the scallop was big and rather juicy too. Enjoyed this!\n\nShishamo Karaage ($6.50 for 4 pieces)\nCrisp, and warm. I love this. Really a treat for people who love fish roe, I feel? Adding a touch of lemon made it less jelat and lighter.\n\nOverall I love this place, it is really cozy, and I find it nice to  chill and catch up with friends, especially after a long week! The staff are friendly too! Please note though, that it is best to book in advance as the place is rather small and so it might be rather challenging to get a place if you walk in and it happens to be fully booked!",

      "text": "Random find as we were thinking of just having a random walk at Kovan to find food, we were supposed to go to Claypot valley but ended up at Tachinomiya. Translated it means standing drinking bar in Japanese.\n\nThere were already a few groups there while we visited, having some merry drinking sessions, alcohol wise, it was priced quite okay compare to other restaurants.\n\nFood wise, we ordered a skewer of bacon wrapped with asparagus, we didnâ€™t really enjoy that too much because it was really tiny so lack of the asparagus taste in it.\n\nThe salmon chirashi don was okay for us, generous amount of salmon and tobiko, but it comes with some salad greens in it, so I was not really used to it.\n\nMy makan partner had the hamburger curry rice, I thought the hamburger serving was much smaller than other restaurant, but given the price we paid, I do thing at neighbourhood price, it is still a place worth going if you want to have a Japanese food fix that is above hawker or food court standard.\n\nTom Pallette ice cream is just a few steps down which I did a review on, that one is a must try.",
