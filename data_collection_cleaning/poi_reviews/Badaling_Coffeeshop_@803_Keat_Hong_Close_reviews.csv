E NKH,1,"Worst service ever provided by the plumper size chinese aunty that brew the coffee or tea. The way she talk to customer is very rude and impolite. Such staff will only spoiled the company reputation. Your salary came from every customer that spent in this coffeeshop and your company cam success is because all this customer as well. Don't talk rude and impolite to the customer when customer didn't even offend you!!!

Please be more hygiene also to wash your hand with soap when every time you do your other task.

Lee Kok Meng,1,"A very good location with lots of blocks in area and bus stop is right in front with 1 and only coffee shop. But Less food choice with inconsistent food quality at economical rice which beginning was good with the right chef. bad attitude staff in HK Roast. I would rather go Keat Hong Market for better food quality. Good part only lots of seats avaliable with good zi char, malay food, tender fresh and king of fried rice.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114274601918611751085/reviews
