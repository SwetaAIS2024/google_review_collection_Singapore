jianhao lee,2,"First time trying this stall and i regret my choice. I ordered fried fish soup with milk and the soup is blend. Not tasty and no taste of milk. To be fair, the fish and ingredient is ok but imo the most important component of a fish soup is the soup. I have check if the shop indicate any healthy choice signs that states less salt less everything but no. While writing this review, i seen other good and bad comments too, and 1 user commented the inconsistency. I guess im the unfortunate one today that get the not good version. Wont try again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107431589322877158256/reviews

Cedric Seet,4,"Great tasting fish soup, fish are fresh although recently the standard has dropped a little, they sometimes mix older fish with fresher fish. But overall still a delectable bowl with a lot of fresh ingredients.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116120424406667932678/reviews
Melissa Ng,4,My favourite fish soup stall in Bishan. Fish is nicely sliced and fresh. Soup can be a little inconsistent as there were times when the soup was blend. Stall holder quite sulky too but I am not there for the service.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114156651934422776392/reviews
San San Chue,2,"Used to be our frequent stall for breakfast and lunch. But the standard has dropped with the price increase by 50 cents. Slice fish is not as fresh, soup not as tasty. It could be a change in the people manning the stall and have not see the usual uncle who will kick start the preparations in the morning.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114840815709530761660/reviews
