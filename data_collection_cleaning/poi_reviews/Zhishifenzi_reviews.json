The aroma of the soup and food is appetising. The seafood and meat are fresh. I would strongly recommend everyone try their marinated meat and seafood because they are tender and delicious. Lastly , the pricing is reasonable due to the excellent food quality and customer service.",

They're super chill and friendly, literally made me feel like the main character from the moment I walked in.\nOverall vibe? 11/10, would happily pull up to a mookata sesh just for this fish. Legit, no crumbs left. Big W.",
