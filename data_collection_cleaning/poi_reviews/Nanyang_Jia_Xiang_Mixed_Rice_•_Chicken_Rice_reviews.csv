Scolistica Sigol,1,I think this shop is not clean. I bought food here for 7 dollars until I got home and ate and was very surprised I saw what looked like a cockroach with the side dish with a cut up condition. It was so dirty I immediately threw it away.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103879880565770473448/reviews
AA 21 011 Lim Mei Qi,1,"The hawker selling chicken rice had a very very bad attitude and blur minded. The total was $5.60 and I gave $10.70. I should have received $5.10 in change, but he only gave me $1.10. When I pointed out the mistake, he acted aggressively as if he wanted to argue. In the end, he only gave me $4.40 and quickly walked away. He still own me $0.7 (I realised after finish eating and walking away)

I advise any tourists who are at this stall or planning to visitâ€”please avoid it.

I hope that CASE can investigate this kind of stall.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112996690105268848567/reviews
angellove Angellove,1,"Is this Vietnamese woman at the stall really desperate for men? She's very polite to older men, but when it comes to women, her face turns sour. She even tricked me into paying more money. I'm a regular customer and know the prices. She gave a discount to the man before me and then charged me the extra, thinking I wouldn't notice. But customers aren't fools.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111138276484995451318/reviews
