Orange,2,"$12.10 for this. Portion is ok, ordered big spicy but not super spicy. Not fragrant. But ok to eat.

Meat and veg all weigh tgt same price.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
Gabrielle Teng,1,"Worst mala I've ever eaten. No sichuan peppercorn fragrance at all, in place was a ""curry instant noodles flavour packet"" taste. Plain salty with no other flavours, I threw the whole serving away. Waiting time was long as well. Hope they improve.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101465964457276514163/reviews
purple taste,4,"Been ordering from this stall for delivery. Get from medium spicy onwards. This was $20 worth but lately, the portion seemed to be dwindling. My orders are always intestine, bamboo shoot, 3 types of vege and two meats. All 100 gms each.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102668978906728306586/reviews

Joshua Kang,5,"Recently got a takeaway from IMM. firstly the staffs were very friendly and helpful when i was choosing my dishes, the food was also cooked just right especially the potato which i find is very different from the others i have tried so far.
