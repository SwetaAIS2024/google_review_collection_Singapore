Farrhan Nyong,4,"Product or Service Quality
The food here is good. I usually have their noodles at night, as that's the only option available-curry rice isn't served during these hours. The noodles are generally well-prepared and satisfying.

Customer Service
Service is fast and polite, making for a smooth and efficient experience.

Value for Money
The value is good, and the basic meals are considered cheap compared to other options at the mall. Menu prices for noodles and rice dishes are reasonable, with many options under S$10.

Cleanliness and Environment
It's not crowded at night, so finding a seat is easy. However, during lunch, it may be hard to get a table. Cleanliness could be improved, especially during peak hours.

Consistency and Reliability
The outlet is quite consistent in food quality and service.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100618397564321501047/reviews
Mong Ong,1,"Stupid q system

oXRYSTALo Ong,4,"Alright, folks, after a disappointing encounter with a sold-out of the signature noodles at Paik's Noodle, Donkey and I decided to explore Waterway Point for a different culinary adventure. Encik Tan, with its inviting aroma and bustling atmosphere, quickly caught our attention.

The Good:

• The Food:  Donkey, opted for the Curry Chicken Drumstick Rice, while I went for the Chicken Wonton Noodles Set. The highlight for Donkey was definitely the piping hot rice, a perfect match for him. He thoroughly enjoyed the flavorful curry and tender chicken drumstick. My Chicken Wonton Noodles set was equally satisfying. The noodles were cooked perfectly, and the broth was light and flavorful. The attentive service staff who happily provided extra garnish made the experience even better.

• The Atmosphere: The cozy ambiance, especially when the restaurant wasn't packed, added to the overall pleasant experience.

The Quirks:

• Nothing really stood out as a “quirk” in this review.

Donkey's Note:  The Curry Chicken Drumstick Rice was amazing! The curry was so flavorful!

My Note: I loved the Chicken Wonton Noodles! They were so tasty and the service was great!

Rating:

• Food: 4/5 (Delicious and satisfying)

• Atmosphere: 4/5 (Cozy and inviting)

• Service: 4/5 (Attentive and friendly)

• Overall: 4/5

Overall, Encik Tan proved to be a delightful detour from our initial plan. The delicious food, attentive service, and comfortable atmosphere made it a perfect choice for a satisfying meal.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews

LP Pua,4,"Ordered their Curry Chicken Cutlet Set at $5. Chicken Cutlet was smaller than previous orders. Taste was average. Overall, average food at average price and good for a quick meal.

Update: I was looking for a place to have a quick meal and decided to try this eatery again. This time, I tried their signature noodles, and it was surprisingly good. No wonder there was always a queue for the noodles. I am upgrading my review from 3 stars to 4 stars.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
