Afiqah Rashid,5,"I had the pleasure of being assisted by Rosalina during my recent visit to this branch, and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. From the moment I approached her counter, she greeted me with a warm smile and a professional demeanor that immediately put me at ease.

Rosalina was incredibly efficient, handling my transactions quickly while ensuring everything was accurate and properly explained. She took the time to answer my questions with patience and clarity, demonstrating both deep knowledge and a genuine willingness to help. What stood out the most was her attentiveness‚Äîshe made sure I felt valued as a customer rather than just another transaction in the queue.

It‚Äôs rare to come across someone who balances professionalism with such a friendly approach, and Rosalina does it effortlessly. Her excellent customer service truly reflects the bank‚Äôs commitment to customer satisfaction. I highly recommend her to anyone visiting this branch, and I hope to be served by her again in the future!

Thank you, Rosalina, for making banking a pleasant experience!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114520873863977611505/reviews
Melissa Ng,5,"Had a great banking experience with staff, Roslina Rozali on 27 Mar 2025. I was in a rush for an appointment but also needed to go to the branch to close off my account urgently before the end of the month. When I reached the branch, Roslina was very quick in serving me by asking what was my needs. She noted my request and directed me immediately to a partition to begin the procedures. She was very observate as she asked if I ran to the branch. When handling my request, she was detailed and explained all the reasons why I need to sign the forms needed. It was overall a wonderful experience banking with her.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116359807619603823073/reviews

Vincent Tan,5,"Had a wonderful experience with Jasmine just now as I needed assistance with a Giro application. Jasmine is attentive, friendly and very professional. Waiting time is minimal and everything was done so efficiently as she made sure I completely understood the procedures.

5 Stars, easy. There‚Äôs actually another UOB nearer to my house but I don‚Äôt mind travelling further to this outlet instead because of the great service. Cheers üëç",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113451332040119183581/reviews
