Justin Hoyo,3,"The most affordable pool area in bugis. Tables, sticks, and staff were all mediocre. I usually just come here because it‚Äôs relatively cheap.

However, they do require a $50 refundable deposit in order to get a table (CASH ONLY). So do take note and bring $50 cash before coming here. Overall my experience here was so-so.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116594589844831001227/reviews
Wookie Ang,5,"Still the best place to go. üòç
I will go there for my own training almost every week and bring family and friends along once in awhile..
One of the staff recognises me as a weekly regular customer and automatically gives me the table that I would always use unless it is super crowded.
Thank you for your great service to this staff.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113330886614581381899/reviews
Apple 30,1,The female staff member at the counter with red hair was extremely rude. I highly do not recommend this place. No surprise that it was nearly empty on a Sunday afternoon‚Äî the service was terrible!,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103698696324797040606/reviews
Darius wong,1,"Service is terrible.
Firstly, the female staff member with the red hair at the counter was rude and passive aggressive. (I saw in a previous review a month ago about a complaint about this person and it looks like she has not changed)
Secondly, a male staff member used language that also came off as rude saying words like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù have some respect for yourself and the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù you ‚Äúrun‚Äù.
They are only interested in charging you and squeezing your wallets dry, for example they have a policy where if you come in a big group you are required to buy a beverage from their bar (what nonsense, my first time hearing of such a rule at a  place to play pool)
I have never felt more scammed and unwelcomed at a pool place. Went there once and never going there ever again there are much better pool places charge significantly less and the service is better.
1h can charge almost 20+ dollars, the bottle water we bought was 3.80 SGD crazy!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114778932260625421754/reviews
Jonathan Ha,5,"Smooth table (well, the cleaner ones anyway), love it if you need to practise positioning. Probably not too good if you are practising your stroke (since you'll probably not do as well on a table less fast). People say the pockets are wider than other pool halls (I wouldn't know, yet)
Service was fine. Didn't order food/drinks.

Update: Some tables roll. But generally still ok. Lovely and honest staff. Left my stuff there a few times, they've kept it both times. ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105083343639912953526/reviews
