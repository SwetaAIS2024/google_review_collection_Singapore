Alan Tan,4,"A football bar type of concept, and located in a more ulu corner of Singapore. A very nice place to chill, have a drink, and watch football. Food is not too bad, but not overly fantastic either. Parking is available just at the side road beside, but park at your own risk.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103801214611209064283/reviews

Sylar Burns,5,"What I find ideal of this place is just the ambiance... Relaxing and enjoyable to be at. In the menu, our table ordered chicken wings, club sandwich & fish & chips... The chicken wings texture: crunchy skin, aromatic and tender meat. Club sandwich bread was toasted well with butter, followed by homemade beef patty. It wasn't the typical club sandwich that was done anyhow in clubs or hotels. The beer battered fish & chips: fish batter was fried till super crispy, yet the fish meat still moistðŸ˜Š. Although it may get crowded during the weekends, but due to the spaciousness, neighbouring chattering didn't bother us much. Lastly, the staff were kind and friendly... In particular, Mae. She's quick to take orders attentive, and friendly! Definitely a thumbs up!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113446848821272550655/reviews

Koh Cuiwen,2,Was not given a big table despite ordering many plates of food in an empty restaurant. 30 mins in we were given a bigger table after making noise. Then 1/4 through our meal a baby cockroach crawled past under the glass panel of the table. 1/2 through our meal another cockroach climbed onto my plate. We quickly paid and left. Server was informed of the infestation but no apologies or corrective action done. Please do not patronise this place. Very unhygienic even when place is empty.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113716734606179634825/reviews
