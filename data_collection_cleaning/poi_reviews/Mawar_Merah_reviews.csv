Md Imran,2,"Clean atmosphere, easy accessible by carpark. Friendly service. Food was disappointing. Rice was warm , egg n chicken is cold. Ordered Nasi lemak . Rice doesn’t taste n smell like Nasi lemak, chilli paste is not Nasi lemak chilli. Price was at $5 . Would consider a steep price compare to average at $3.50.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105260310271547304227/reviews

Muhd Irfan,4,"I think the other reviewers really got to chill abit. To me the food is good, yes on the pricey side but come on, look at where its situated.

For me the dishes are reminiscent to homecooked authentic padang dishes that is hard to find nowdays.

Hey, if you want your michellin star nasi padang then by all means head somewhere else. But if you want the nostalgic home cooked padang dishes, then give it a try.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107095750247183991758/reviews
Gopi Bala,4,"I happened to pass by this stall 3 days ago, and decided to have lunch here today.

I had a plate of rice with black squid, vegetable, begedil and sambal belachan.

The squid was tasty and not too chewy, while the veg was crunchy as tasty too. The begedil was also soft, tender and tasty. The belachan was spicy and great to eat.

I also ordered gado gado and took it home to eat. The gado gado was also good, but the sauce or gravy could have been thicker and this would have made it even better.

Definitely worth going back again to sample the other food.

There are also chai png, western and Vietnamese food stalls in the main coffeeshop.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114775727475904526433/reviews
Aaron Chng,1,"Food is just not nice. We ordered the fried garlic chicken with rice and the fried Maggi Mee with egg.
The garlic chips didn’t taste fresh. The seasoning for the noodles were salty in some parts and tasteless in others. We just couldn’t finish the food.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112158347997474722769/reviews
