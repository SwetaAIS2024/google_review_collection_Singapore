Even though there were a lot of people at the time the food was unlimited. Sides were fresh and tasted great. Meats were seasoned well and the even had squid! Staff were attentive to our table when we needed the plates to be cleared. Dinner for 4 including a 20% discount was $110+. Will come again!!",

The food selection is really wide and quality is good.\nEverything was marinated nicely.the honey chicken and short ribs were my favorite.\nThe fried chicken was also tasty, and the cheese fries surprisingly good! The kimchi soup we had was flavorful too.\nAs for that pandan dessert everyone was raving about? Yes..it is indeed as delicious as everyone said üëçüèª\nThe service was pretty good..very fast in clearing dishes. Not the most polite but they are efficient.",

The chicken wings are also a highlight, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Plus, it's Halal certified, so you can enjoy with peace of mind. Service is efficient, and the atmosphere is cozy. Don't miss out on this hidden gem! 5/5 stars.",
