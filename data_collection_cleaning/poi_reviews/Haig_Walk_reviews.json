It connects Dunman Road to East Coast Road, passing through some road lanes.\nðŸŒ¿On both sides of the walkway are mostly private residences.\nðŸŒ¿Several fitness corners and children play areas are dotted along the walkway.\nðŸŒ¿There are lots of plants and trees along the clean walkway making the walk a pleasant one.\nðŸŒ¿Should it rains unexpectedly, you could take cover at one of the several shelters located at the walkway.\nðŸŒ¿Nice walkway without Road traffic.",

They're not in the way, so if you don't like plants, you've got nothing to complain about. Would I take a detour to get there? Not really. Would I walk it if it was the shortest route from where I am to where I'm going? Definitely! Deserves every one of the three stars. Especially the first two.",
