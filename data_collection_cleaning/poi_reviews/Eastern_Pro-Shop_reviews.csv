MC SM,5,Very experienced and polite Uncle! Redrilled my old ball because he noticed the span was too long and subsequently upgraded my ball to the new 900 Global Reality Solid! Uncle James even took the effort to see me bowl with it and gave me pointers. Looking forward to my second arsenal from him!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110245550123443528486/reviews
