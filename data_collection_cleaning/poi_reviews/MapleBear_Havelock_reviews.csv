A K,5,"Weâ€™ve had a fantastic experience at Maplebear Childcare, and I couldnâ€™t be more grateful for the care my daughter has received. The huge indoor playground keeps kids active regardless of the weather, and the classrooms are bright and inviting with plenty of natural light. âœ¨

The facilities are always clean and well-maintained, which gives me peace of mind knowing my daughter is in a safe environment.

Maplebear also offers an option for swimming lessons at the Furama Hotel pool, which is connected to the school. The outdoor garden at the hotel is another favorite. The music classes are professionally taught, and we look forward to see those cute music videos edited by Ms. Pam. ðŸ˜†

A huge shoutout to the wonderful teachers: Yan Lao Shi, Ms. Denissa, Ms. Roselle, Ms. Pam, Zhang Lao Shi, Ms. Pearlyn, Ms. Siti, and Ms. Audrey. ðŸ’¯ They put so much effort into preparing engaging lessons, creating fun materials, and decorating for every holiday eventâ€”making the learning experience both nurturing and exciting.

Thank you to the entire Maplebear team for everything you do. We are so appreciative of the warm, creative, and safe environment you have created for our daughter! ðŸ¥°",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108862832903069389554/reviews
Vincent Tham,5,"We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to MapleBear, Havelock and the dedicated team of teachers for the incredible care and guidance they have provided to our son over the past two years.

Our journey to find the right childcare was not an easy one, as our son had previously attended two centres that underwent management changes which did not align with our expectations. As he was about to start K1, we knew we had to find a stable and nurturing environment for him, especially with primary school on the horizon. A trusted friend, whose three children attended MapleBear, Havelock highly recommended the centre to usâ€”and it turned out to be one of the best decisions weâ€™ve made.

The teachers at MapleBear, Havelock are attentive and patient, helping our son work through some areas of delayed growth while ensuring he feels supported and encouraged. They kept us updated on his progress, and it was heartwarming to see how he quickly grew to like and interact well with his teachers. The principal and centre director are hands-on, actively involved in teaching and shaping the childrenâ€™s development, which speaks volumes about their dedication.

While our son initially was afraid of one of the teachers due to her strict approach, we came to appreciate the importance of instilling discipline and preparing him for the transition to primary school. That balance of care and discipline has been invaluable in helping him grow into a confident and capable child, ready to take on the next stage of his education.

As our son graduates from K2, we look back with immense gratitude for the schoolâ€™s unwavering efforts in nurturing him and providing such a positive experience. Thank you, MapleBear, Havelock for your exceptional work in shaping young minds and giving our child a strong foundation for his future! ðŸ˜Š",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110814913782768097373/reviews
