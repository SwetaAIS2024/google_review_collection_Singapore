M *,3,"The menu offers a diverse selection of Asian and Western dishes, and the portions are quite generous. The lamb shank is normal, quite a big portion. The meat is tender and surprisingly served quickly. The chicken parmigiana is average, using chicken thighs that aren’t ideal for this dish, but the tomato and cheese combination is fine. The spaghetti in tomato sauce and chicken meat balls is presented nicely and tastes quite good. The pasta olio oglio came last, with a seafood seasoning that was a bit too salty, but otherwise it was decent.

The ordering system using QR codes isn’t very smooth and doesn’t load properly. This could be improved.

Overall, it’s a good place for a normal, average meal. However, the cake seems to be quite popular at secret recipe.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103330821176864508073/reviews

Cool Dragon,3,"We had the seafood marinara & Bolognese pasta... Both were warmed... (Seemed and felt like they were microwaved)...

For the price we paid, not quite worth the value!

The place was warm due to the sun and the glass ceiling... Can consider to propose installing a canopy to block out some UV...",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111581562324190364285/reviews
Jechtto,3,"Ita been a over 5 years since I dined at SR, can't remember what my impressions were back then so I decided to give it a shot again. Food wise I would say there are probably at about the same level as Swensen's. The mushroom soup and garlic bread were serviceable but nothing to write home about, the nasi Goreng with fried chicken though was elevated to pretty good thanks to its tangy and spicy sambal paste. The rice and chicken were pretty average, portions were adequate but thats about all the positives i can think of. The ice lemon tea was average as well. Will I come back again? Maybe if I wanna try someone their other dishes, would be good if they sold that sambal in a jar, I would definitely buy that.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106407471320614893952/reviews
Drew Esa,4,"My spouse and I just wanted to sip coffee while shopping. But we didn't realize there would be such a wide selection. It's great to have such a wide selection. By the way, the lunch menu is also very good. Convenient system of entering the order office via qr code and paying by card or cash. Coffee was very tasty. Now every time we go shopping in Plaza Singapura we will drink coffee here.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100231074350729929090/reviews
