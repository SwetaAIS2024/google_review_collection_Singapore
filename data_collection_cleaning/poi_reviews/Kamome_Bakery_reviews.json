And there seems to be a wonderful varieties of breads to choose from.\nDecided to try their set meal which was a quite a good deal - Ham & cheese sandwich with long black.\nCoffee was light and easy to drink. Only bummer was, although I’m dining in, it was served in a takeaway cup.\nSandwich was served with a side salad.",

It's still an average to above average croissant, just for that price tag I find it not worth it.\n\nService is good and they can reheat for you. Staff are also very friendly.",

My mushroom bacon cheese croissant was crispy and savoury and even the side salad was delicious!!! I bought the famous red bean bun and pan Au chocolate home. Both were lovely. The atmosphere was also chill and relaxing. Really rare to find such places in SG nowadays!",

The red bean with butter bun was honestly pretty nice! Got a bacon tomato pizza as well and it was nice when toasted.\nHonestly a good place to sit and chill in the middle of the day.",

Would have been better if some of the food didn’t taste so soggy - like the crab croquette bun - after being warmed up (maybe they used microwave instead of toaster oven). Flat white was good even though the coffee is machine-made.",
