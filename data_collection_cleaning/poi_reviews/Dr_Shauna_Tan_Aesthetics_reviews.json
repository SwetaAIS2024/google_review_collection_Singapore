      "text": "Great and pleasant experience under the skilful hands of Dr Shauna Tan. Dr Shauna is not only attentive to details but her suggested treatment protocol using fillers worked wonders on my face. The hollows on my face look plump and naturally lifted. My fine lines were also erased as a result. What i see and have now is a subtle yet youthful v-shaped face and appearance. Really happy with the results, and yes! A big thank you and shoutout to Dr Shauna Tan for her expert advice and treatment plan.",

She also administered Profhilo injections for me on three occasions - the procedure was fast with minimal pain thanks to her quick hands.\n\nWill definitely recommend if you're looking for a knowledgeable and skilled doctor to address your skincare concerns!",
