Clarence,5,"Good location and conveniently so. One thing, too cramped sometimes, the billiard boards shorten my space, and seats are placed so that I have to always ask for space which is tedious to my own nerve-wracking system and approach.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108721898472113765758/reviews

Siti Nur Aisyah Salehhudin,5,"The place was awesome!
Really enjoyed the quiet but bustling place despite the heightened measures.
Price was affordable, and a Kakak was super kind enough to let us utilize her cash after we  transferred her the amount.
Will be going again soon!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117761919390764041247/reviews
Aakash A,4,"You get what you pay, we went on a weekday paid 12 dollars for an hour. It’s not super fancy place but tons of pool tables to pick and play from. They only take cash and ask you to keep deposit as well  which means if you are planning paynow, PayLah! or paywave or ang credit card service forget it, there is no atm nearby so better to keep cash before you go there. There are some lockers and most we saw regulars coming be practicing, there is room for improvement but I feel it’s pretty much you get what you pay.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106519798782716225030/reviews
