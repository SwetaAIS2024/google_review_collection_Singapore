Rob and Jan Burns McCubbin,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed our late breakfast at Killiney, scrambled eggs and ham on toast with local coffee (Kopi). A bit hard to find as it's on an upper level of the shopping centre, but well worth searching out. Great value compared to all the overpriced western style coffee shops which have sprung up in the area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111941788618411539281/reviews
