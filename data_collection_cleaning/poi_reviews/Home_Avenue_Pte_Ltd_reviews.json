      "text": "Got my vinyl flooring from these guys 3+ years ago and it supposedly came with 10 years’  BC warranty. Everything was good, installation went well and all.\n\nNow, it’s 3 years later and I need them to do something for me. I called the same number and it was COWAY; yes, the water filter company. It’s okay. The COWAY people were kind enough to give me the new contact number.\n\nI called the contact number and someone picked up confirming that it’s Home Avenue. I told them about the vinyl floors and what I needed from them. They said, “oh, this is Home Avenue, but we only sell air conditioners now.”\n\nI asked, “So… what does this mean? What about my 10 years warranty?” The lady said she will check and get back to me.\n\nIt’s been 2 weeks. I’ve sent multiple follow-up texts and made many calls that don’t get answered.\n\nYup, they ghosted me.\n\nSigh.",
