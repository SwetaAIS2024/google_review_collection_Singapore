Ivar,5,"One of the hidden gems in jb, a lovely home based cafe with very pleasant and aromatic coffee hidden right behind Lotus shopping center. Great for working or studying away from home.

zac,3,"The cafe, situated in an unusual spot surrounded by car workshops, disappoints with a limited menu and several items out of stock. The drinks, especially the RM10 Thai tea lacking its expected flavor, come with a hefty price tag. On a positive note, the fresh tauhu bakar is good, but the peanut sauce is lacking and not abundant.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114982396111701305513/reviews
