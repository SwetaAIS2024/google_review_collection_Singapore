The Macdonaldâ€™s nearby is always crowded during weekends as well due to its convenience and proximity to West Coast park.  The big grass field in West Coast Park allows for many sport events such as soccer, frisbee, softball, etc to be played by many participants and also attracts kite flyers.  Cyclists are a plenty here too",
