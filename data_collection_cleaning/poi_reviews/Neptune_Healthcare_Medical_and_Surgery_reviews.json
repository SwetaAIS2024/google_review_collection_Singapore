Doctor said i could jump queue and when I came back, the receptionist ask me to join in the queue for afternoon slot when actually i was in the morning slot. Pls educate your receptionist on how to maintain customer service cause they are rude to the patient. I demand an apology!",

The doctor will only start seeing patients at 10.30am. The google details should be updated from 9am to 10.30am to ensure accuracy and prompt service.",

      "text": "One star is only for the doctor. The doctor is good and experienced which is why despite having to wait for 1hr, I am ok. However, the receptionists were unprofessional and not observant to patient needs despite having so many receptionist there.\n\nLast week, I was having fever and flu. At 5.30, I registered for evening session and I was asked to come back at 6.30pm and call to check. So I waited outside and went back at 620pm, I sat there till 7pm and I was the last patient. Then I heard the receptionist calling someone and said that the doctor will only start at 8pm. I was so shocked and asked why did they ask me to come back at 6.30pm then? She denied that her staff mentioned that and asked me to have dinner and come back at 8pm, and i’m the eighth in queue.\n\nThey saw me sitting there alone and they know that they are not accepting patients already so why didn’t they informed me earlier that I was registered for the night session, why did they say evening session?? I went back home and called back 845pm, guess what? They are still at number 1…i gave up. This clinic is really the worst. I will never go back again.",
