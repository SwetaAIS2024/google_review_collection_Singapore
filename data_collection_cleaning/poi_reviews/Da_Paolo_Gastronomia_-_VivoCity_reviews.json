Coffee was okay, but seems they have changed to the smaller cup now for the regular size. Bread was okay and got reheated too, served with butter and jam.\nOn the other day I came and ordered their Cranberry Cornflakes Scone and Hot Skinny Cappuccino. But this time the scone served was not warm, I would say it was still cold even though I‚Äôve asked it to be reheated. It didn‚Äôt taste as good, because it‚Äôs cold.\nEnvironment and service is okay. They provided plain water too.",
