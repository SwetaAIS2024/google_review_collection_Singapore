Some lecturers are biased and unhelpful.\n\nOne of the worst moments was when a lecturer was inattentive during my presentation despite my disability—either staring blankly into space or using her phone. And it didn’t just happen once. It happened more than twice.\n\nBias and favoritism are very real here, so choose your diploma wisely.",
