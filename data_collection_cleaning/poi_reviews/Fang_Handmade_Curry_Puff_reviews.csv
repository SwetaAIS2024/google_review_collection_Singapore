C Lau,5,"5 stars purely for the puff, and how delicious it is. The pastry is adequately savoury and crispy. The curry filling is aromatic and just the right level of spice for me. Great pastry to filling ratio. Yum! One of the best curry puffs in SG, in my opinion.

Service felt a little disinterested.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111709618871776121851/reviews
Xi Min Ong,5,"Highly recommend this curry puff stall!

The puffs are always fresh, with a generous amount of quality ingredients inside.

Frequently order the sardine and tuna mayo varieties, and they never disappoint. The egg tarts are also fantasticâ€”super soft and delicious. Even when kept in the fridge and served the next day, the taste remains great! Plus, the prices are very reasonable for the quality.

Definitely worth a visit for anyone craving tasty and affordable treats!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117443955874871704198/reviews
Kok Meixuan,4,"Its near the cdc driving centre, so very easy to check out after lessons.

Wanted to see if the hype was true, and yeah the puffs are pretty good. I got chicken mushroom, lava cheese and lava salted egg. The curry chicken sold out and its only 12.30pm.

The lava cheese is sweet, the lava salted egg is very nice, reminds me of liu sha bao. The mushroom chicken is fragrant",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113338357339345752705/reviews
Andy Quek,5,Very very delicious curry puff! Flakey and not so spicy. Salted egg was good too. My son loved the lava cheese puff! Will definitely be back again!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100264582370959478951/reviews
Linus S,5,"You can taste the freshness of the ingredients (chicken, egg) in the curry puff. Fresh handmade is truly a way to describe. Bought 13 pieces, my family love it. Will come back",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107197039324302769059/reviews
