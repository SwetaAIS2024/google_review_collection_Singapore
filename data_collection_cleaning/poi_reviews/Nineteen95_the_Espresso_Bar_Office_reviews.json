Julian was a very very patient trainer and also very determine to find out our pouring mistakes during latte art. He constantly keep finding out what are the root causes in our pouring and gave us various solutions and alternatives to improve our pouring motions. We highly recommend Basic Barista and latte art course and kudos to both the guys at Nineteen95 the Espresso Bar!",
