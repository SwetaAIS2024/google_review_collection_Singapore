Rakesh Tomar,5,"Dr Divya Singh deserves kudos for her efficiency & good nature. Overall atmosphere in the clinic is very cordial, friendly & helpful. Besides, ever smiling Ms Vinna at the reception is not only affable but knows her job well.

Min Say,5,Iâ€™ve been visiting Dr Divya at Newport Dental for the past 3 years for all my dental-related appointments. I feel very comfortable and at ease because of her top-notch skills - and this is coming from someone who used to be so afraid of dentist visits when I was a kid. Highly recommended!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101793440853170835735/reviews
Farah Weers,5,"Doctor Divya may look scary at first (just like any other dentists) but sheâ€™s super professional and she actually took the time to go the extra mile for some of my appointments (as I forgot to mention that I want to do filling on top of scaling and polishing). She explains what sheâ€™s going to do and why she has to do it so that I have some clarity in my concerns (Iâ€™m pretty scared of the dentist cos of very bad experiences). She ensures that thereâ€™s little-to-no-pain in my visits and always does her job efficiently. Some visits still hurts but itâ€™s worth it if extra care and attention was given by the doctor. Pricing wise, Iâ€™m not that experienced but as a newly-working adult, I think itâ€™s still pricey. But I guess itâ€™s manageable after awhile. Depends on what service you opt for. The doctorâ€™s assistant and the clerk at the desk is always friendly too! They ensure that Iâ€™m comfortable and always patient when I had to reschedule my appointments for the umpteenth time ðŸ˜­ thank you for your professionalism and patience!!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107865611799778394910/reviews
