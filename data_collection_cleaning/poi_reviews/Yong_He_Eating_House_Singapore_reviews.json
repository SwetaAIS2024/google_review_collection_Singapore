Few pieces of intestines in it and considered expensive.\nThe fried meat dumplings were deep fried to the extent inside was dried.\nSoy bean drink was the only one I liked as well as the spicy chili.\nI believe the standard had dropped since I knew the shop.",

If you are a small eater, it should fill you up.\n\nAs for the taste, mee sua was not starchy enough, pancake was very oily. However, the porridge was thick enough, and chilled soy milk was perfect in this weather.\n\nAs for the vibe, do not expect a restaurant style. It is just for a quick bite and not a place where you would sit to chat and chill. I am sure you get what I mean.",

Very bad fried spring onion cake 蔥油餅 and carrot cake 蘿蔔糕. 蔥油餅 is dried and can’t be chewed like plastic. 蘿蔔糕 taste sour and not fresh, hard and dry too. Not worth the price, totally! $8.20 spent.",

The soy milk is tasty and can adjust your own sugar level. The scallion oil pancake with egg is on the oily side as well and we'd prefer a crispier dough.",

Now it’s just kinda sad, and I think just like the crowd, the food has also dropped in standard. However their bean curd and soy milk is still good. Hope they bounce back.",
