      "text": "Absolutely love the Christmas setup here every time if the year with its elaborate but not overly done Christmas decor, as well as Christmas carols. Lots of shopping available here all year round. The car park is easily accessible too, I could quite easily get a lot over the weekend too; slow down to look for the car park directions especially turning from the main road. Otherwise it‚Äôs easily accessible by MRT train or bus too. Long history with its first store opening back in 1932!",

      "text": "TANGS at Tang Plaza is one of the most iconic department stores located on Orchard Road, and my recent visit confirmed its esteemed reputation within Singapore's retail sector.  It offers a diverse selection of goods suitable for both residents and tourists, with a particularly extensive range for those interested in fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products.\n\nLocation and Accessibility\nIts central location on Orchard Road, directly connected to the Orchard MRT station via underground passageways, is exceptionally convenient, particularly for those visiting multiple shopping malls. The Scotts Road entrance is impressive and welcoming, retaining a touch of classic Singaporean architecture.\n\nStore Layout and Offerings\nTANGS surpasses the typical department store experience; it's a thoughtfully curated environment. The well-organized layout allows for leisurely exploration without feeling overwhelming. The ground floor showcases an extensive array of beauty products and luxury skincare brands, including La Mer, SK-II, and Est√©e Lauder.  The staff at these counters are knowledgeable and provided helpful service without being overly insistent.\n\nOn the upper floors, a stylish selection of fashion items is available, ranging from high-end international brands to local Singaporean designers.  The store's unique offerings distinguish it from other department stores and malls.  The menswear section also presents a noteworthy collection with a contemporary and understated style.\n\nFood and Facilities\nA delightful surprise at TANGS is the food area in the basement.  It features various takeaway counters and a small food court offering high-quality local cuisine.",
