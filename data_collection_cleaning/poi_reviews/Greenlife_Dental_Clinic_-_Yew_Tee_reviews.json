She cleaned my teeth thoroughly, and I could feel the difference in how deep the cleaning was. She took the time to explain my dental situation in detail, making sure I fully understood and offering helpful advice. Her assistant Angeline was also very attentive and kind, which made the visit even more comfortable. The reception staffs were warm, friendly, and polite, completing the overall positive experience.",

Before my surgery, he took the extra step to read up on similar cases to better prepare and ensure everything went smoothly‚Äîsomething I truly appreciated.\nMs. Jamie was equally impressive. She was meticulous with the prescriptions and even followed up to check how I was feeling. The assistant was also very friendly and made me feel comfortable throughout the visit. Overall, I felt well cared for by a professional and kind team. Highly recommend!",
