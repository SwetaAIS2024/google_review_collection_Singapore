The accompanying rice is fragrant and perfectly cooked, having absorbed the rich chicken broth. The dipping sauce is a fantastic complement, offering a tangy and slightly spicy kick that elevates the entire dish. For a taste of authentic and comforting Thai cuisine, this chicken rice is a must-try.",
