Ramya Thulasiraman,5,"Life's most important phases, just happen. Enrolling our son at Milagros was one such for us. We sent him in as a nursery child at Yew tee center with the usual tears of fear and anxiety.

The teachers there did a  tremendous job with so much love and care that the school felt as our extended home. Learning and development were holistic and kids were happy, confident and becoming independent. The curriculum and study materials were curated carefully. 'Magic' happened through the years and our son bloomed so beautifully in the safe hands of Milagros teachers.

They also prepared the kids for primary schooling during the last semester of Kindergarten which I've never seen in other schools. Their Annual/Graduation day is a big day that's been looked forward by both, kids and parents. Overall we as parents, very highly recommend this school. Thank you Milagros and team for doing one of the most beautiful jobs in the world!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115410516834653247173/reviews
Sugandha Pandia,5,"We could not have asked for a better school for our son. He started here when he was 18 months old... over the years we have seen him blossom and grow and learn so much.
The stand out part about Milagros are the teachers. The teachers are extremely atttentive and loving. When I see them interact with my son, I feel a huge sense of relief and joy .... because it feels he is safe, cared for, loved and has a lot of fun. They know every little detail about him, including his food preferences (which even I miss sometimes)
His confidence and vocabulary has improved remarkably. I cannot recommend this school enough - esp. for a tender age, where imparting values and life skills are so important. It is a home away from home.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105033813813405392057/reviews
Simin Low,5,"""Play is the work of a child,"" and learning through play is truly one of the most enriching experiences for kids! At Milagros, children are always excited to go to school, eager to explore and discover something new every day.

There are no limits to what a child can dream, learn, or achieve! The hands-on activities and creative approaches, like becoming ""multilingual"" through music, inspire creativity, curiosity, and a lifelong love for learning.

A heartfelt thank you to all the amazing teachers at Milagros for your patience, dedication, and guidance toward Rebecca and Isaac. You‚Äôve made deep footprints on their journey, shaping their growth and inspiring their potential!

We are absolutely thrilled with our  experience at Milagros de Montessori.  Since joining, my child has become so much more independent ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è and confident. We‚Äôve noticed remarkable improvements in their social skills, learning abilities, and overall development.
