      "text": "Holland Green Linear Park is a stretch of narrow green space running parallel to Bukit Timah Diversion Canal.\nThis Diversion canal was constructed to divert rainwater away from Bukit Timah into Pandan River to alleviate flood condition at Bukit Timah area.\nThe Park can be access from Garlick Ave, and from Blackmore Drive.\nAt the eastern end of the Park is a Playground. Next to it along Holland Plain is an exercise corner.\nOn the western end is the Bukit Timah Diversion Canal Wetlands with sediment pool and vegetation to cleanse the water.\nA man-made Cascading waterfall can be seen at the Diversion Canal.\nThe Holland Green Linear Park western end connect up to the Rail Corridor.\nThere is a very big field parallel to this Linear Park where people are seen flying drones, run their dogs.\nThe big field was a former Hakka burial ground called Fung Yun Thai Cemetery (丰永大坟山) that was exhumed in the early eighties.\nThis serene Park is a great place to walk, jog, cycle, walk the dog; or just simply enjoy its tranquility.",

Even though this park can lead to the rail green corridor, there are not much people that will take the side track to come here. Hope that it will stay this way and not become rowdy if more people discovered this place.",
