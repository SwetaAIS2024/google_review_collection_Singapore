Michael Goh,1,"Super bad service. Damaged my tin of paint, dented the tin, spilled the paint all over. Did not want to give new tin nor any discount for the damage. After he spilled and damaged the tin, he blamed me that this was the result of me not buying the more expensive brand. ðŸ˜¡",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110420911210765186744/reviews

nur aisah,1,"not very helpful. You go in with photos of the angles and corners that need parts. nevermind if cannot get same parts, at least provide alternatives la. how can you ask people bring the cupboard to your shop?! take taxi arh? then ask the item send back china. wah. easy say hor. All three times i go there, same treatment. discrimination siol.

Don't know which part of his expertise and experience are the rest of the reviewers raving about. It's one thing that a customer is helpless in naming the exactly types of nails/screws, but it's totally an insult that uncle assumes we don't know what we're talking about. An make it our fault for buying items that happened to have missing parts/tools.

We go your shop hoping you have the items so we can buy and fix ourselves le. We provide you measurements of the holes that the rivets/screw etc ok.

Eh sudah la. Role your mat up uh.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108294087803369997267/reviews
Max Chan,5,"Just had my keys made, the boss is experience and willing to refine the key until it fits, the Duro keys fabricated for only $10 (each) which u canâ€™t find this price else where. In fact this is the 2nd time I went, the first time I bought a higher quality long extension cable which not many heartland shops carry. They do carry some mid- good quality stuff, but have to prepare to pay a bit more which I donâ€™t mind at all. Lastly, get your Nippon paint there, they have the machine to give u any color u want.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104504817180475363150/reviews
