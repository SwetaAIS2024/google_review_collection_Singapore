And the recomendation that I received was good ! The mala fried rice was incredible and the fried chicken was also amazing. Surely will comeback. Reasonable price. The only thing is when it comes to lunch time it was pack since there is quite a few seats available. However, overall satisfied my craving of hot food. üòä Please open more branch in Johor area.",

      "text": "Absolutely love their fried rice, particularly, Tom Yam & sambal flavours. The type of rice they use is Calrose rice, which has a great texture that takes the dish to another level. Also, I'm a fan of their cute takeaway box that looks like those used for Chinese takeaway seen in American TV shows. Service is generally fast; restaurant is clean and air-conditioned. The only take is, they only start operating at noon time.",
