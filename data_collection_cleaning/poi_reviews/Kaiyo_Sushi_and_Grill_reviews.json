      "text": "I really have to put it in a very diplomatic way but it is difficult. The tempura batter reminded me of goreng pisang. Grilled shiitake tasted raw and only the charred bits hinted that the 2 skewers with 8 SLICES of mushroom was actually cooked partially. By the way it was priced at 6 dollars and i think that is the most profitable, by percentage, dish for the restaurant!\n\nThankfully we ordered sashimi that need not be cooked and so ate something that resembles Japanese cuisine.\n\nOnly saving grace is there are enough tables and space in the restaurant so you can hang out for hours if you don't mind sub-standard stuff.",

Udon is not my usual thicc texture either but simple and satisfying. Chawanmushi came at the end but was a warming finishing touch to a very nice meal. Will be back again to try their other dishes!",
