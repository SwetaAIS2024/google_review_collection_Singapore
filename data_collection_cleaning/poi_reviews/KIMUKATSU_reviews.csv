Denise Ong,4,"Gave this place a try on Good Friday with my friends. Ordered 2 pax of the original tonkatsu (there‚Äôs a discount on this meal now costing $14.90 each).

The rice came in a big Japanese rice container for us. Scoop the rice into the bowl provided. The rice portion was filling for us.

The tonkatsu was tasty. There‚Äôs also 1 sweet and 1 salty sauce provided to dip the meat into.

Miso soup was also nice, I finished the whole bowl of it üòÇ

Enjoyed the meal with good company overall.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105885270396733702572/reviews
Bill,4,"Had a great dinner after shopping. We tried pork katsu set, both original and black pepper. I personally like the original, the black pepper is very suitable for pepper lovers.

Meat is tender and portion is just nice (not too much). Sauce also good, but i feel like better giving a salt for dipping is better than soy sauce.
Free flow cabbage. I could easily eat at least 2 servings of cabbage at one go.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107909107247114958513/reviews
Taste ‚ÄúTasteNomNomz‚Äù Traveler,4,"Garlic flavored pork katsu tastes good but somehow, the layered pork meat texture is too dry and tough. Kinda difficult to chew.

They served each portion with miso soup, side dishes, and a decent amount of dips. I personally feel the rice was a bit of a waste as they served too much of it in the bucket.

It was very crowded during the weekend's lunchtime, so it‚Äôs better to visit a bit early.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109334009489910031119/reviews

Steven Soo,5,"It's like food court concept when allocated seats for the individual stall/restuarants. It's order first and they will assign seats. Recommend their beef cutlet and was cook in perfection at medium rare. Although only one person, they provide a standard rice container for you to scoop. Price already include gst hence total cost $31.30 (include drink), value for money",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102309295159637658350/reviews
