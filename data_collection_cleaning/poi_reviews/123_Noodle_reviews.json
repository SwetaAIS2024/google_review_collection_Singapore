The food taste fantastic especially the mince meat noodles and the special add on meatballs which taste superb.\n\nTheir prawn noodles use fresh prawns and not frozen prawns. The stall owners spend an hour plus to peel the shells of over 1000 prawns. üí™üí™\n\nüëçüëçüëçüòãüòãüòãü•∞ü•∞ü•∞",
