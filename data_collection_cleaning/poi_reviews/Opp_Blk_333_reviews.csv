Ho Robert,5,"""Chinatown to Chinatown"": At a bus stop on a one-way road, only route 80 and 145 buses pass by. However, this is a long and long road with a long history - ""Car Street"". In those days, when there was no running water supply, bullock carts used to carry buckets of well water through this road, and ""Chinatown"" was named after this. Chinatown People's Theater and Chinatown Community Club are on Vanner Hill along this road, and Keong Sik Street is not far away. ． ． ． ．",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105753813256061140265/reviews
