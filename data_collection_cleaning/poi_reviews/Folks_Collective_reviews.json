It‚Äôs a little bit sweet and not spicy at all.\nThe yellow curry with prawns is a small portion with 4 prawns üç§ but enough to share with 2-3, a little bit spicy but I think with rice will be better with noodles.\nI didn‚Äôt try the salmon but they said it‚Äôs ok.\nThe papaya was not sour and spicy enough it‚Äôs mildly sweet.\nOverall the food is ok.",

Loved the dishes like the green curry and Omelette, of high standard.\nPrice point wasn‚Äôt the best, main reason why you would come here is probably because of the drinks. The portions were small yet cost was high. Dishes like kangkong and Tom Yum was a little disappointing and not spicy or tasty enough.\n\nSERVICE\nFriendly and efficient service, they even took the effort to clean the seats when we felt it wasn‚Äôt too clean.\n\nATMOSPHERE\nVery nicely designed and not too cramped, with a comfortable exterior and interior.",
