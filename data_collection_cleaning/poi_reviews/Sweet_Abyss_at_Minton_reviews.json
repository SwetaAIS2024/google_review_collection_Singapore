      "text": "I dropped by to pick up a coffee. This lady staff on duty was friendly but as a coffee lover, I was disappointed when I saw her pressing buttons and realised that my flat white was going to be fully machine made, like those you get from hotel buffets. The coffee was freshly grounded so the smell was lovely. Unfortunately, coffee is a complex beverage to get right and for $5-$6, I was expecting more. I didnt get any other items so this review is solely for a takeaway flat white.",

      "text": "Review is for coffee, banana cake and brownie only as pictured.\n\nPlus: desserts were excellent. Brownie wasn't too hard or dry as it looked, and banana cake wasn't too sweet. Coffee was alright, nothing stella and a little weak but at a great price point. Ample parking for non residents at visitor lots. Was responsive on whatsapp.\n\nMinuses: despite rave reviews, we found the service lacking. After much pondering, perhaps the owner/server/barista wasn't rude, he was just of a very quiet nature. Menu wasn't intuitive with no pictures, and when asked which desserts were available that day (as there were none displayed except a chalk board with muffins written on it), he simply remarked \"which dessert you want?\". When the food was ready, he did not call out to us to collect and left it on the counter on top of the single menu in the coffee shop while others were browsing and talking over our food. we did not expect that it was self service since it was such a small shop, and frankly it should've have been told to us when we ordered. Also noticed that despite it being a hot day and having two air-conditioners in the shop, only one above the cashier was turned on. Finally, no water was served, not uncommon but still a minus for us. There were a decent number of tables and seats, but the tables were rickety and unstable. Not being fussy, but important to share feedback for improvement.\n\nConclusion: just come for the desserts, and ignore the service since you're not there to socialise. Great place for residents nonetheless, and might return for their bakes if in the area.",

Also quite a good selection of desserts as well as mains that are ever expanding cos they are always experimenting w new things. Sometimes items not in stock though, can check on delivery platforms or via their WhatsApp number. Can bring your own tumble for a discount.",
