Serene Tan,4,"Tried the Roasted Duck Noodles ($4.50) and Char Siew Roast Pork Rice ($4.50). Comes with soup. Reasonable prices.

Both dishes taste not bad. Meats were nice, not tough, and the sauce tasty. Roast pork skin crunchy. Good option for roast meats if you're in the area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107538103583075098533/reviews

Iggy Chng,1,The better shop in the same block closed due to CNY. Had no choice but to order from here. The Worker here Very very bad attitude. Taunted and replying in a very rude manner in every question we asked . We are there to give him business not see his black face and bad attitude. I will give it a miss at all cost.

Consume Less Life,4,"Ordered the steamed chicken rice @ $3.50. Reasonable prices, fragrant rice and juicy chicken breast slices. The soup is also very tasty.

The chilli is not your typical chicken rice chilli. It is more of a garlic chili which does not really match with the chicken rice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110552173397165649305/reviews
