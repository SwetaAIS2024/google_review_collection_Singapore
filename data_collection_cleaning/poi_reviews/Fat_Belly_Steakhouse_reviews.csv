JATHL,5,"Surprisingly, it wasnâ€™t the steak that made the meal so memorable but rather the side dish and the dessert. Not that the steak wasnâ€™t good.
I had their hanger steak, which had a decent crust and was a bit under done but was perfectly fine to me. Iâ€™d rather under than over. It was served with coarse salt and roasted garlic, which is more than you need with good beef.
The Brussels sprouts though, were outstanding! I think they were the best Iâ€™ve ever had, so far! Perfectly crispy and tossed in their sauce mix that balanced the bitterness superbly.
The tiramisu was quite a delight as well! Creamy yet airy, with a hint of bitterness that was mitigated by the drizzle of chocolate sauce. It was like an ebb and flow of gentle sweetness and bitterness throughout.
Shout out to the waitress for the recommendations! Her knowledge of the menu, passion and friendliness added to the whole experience!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110357299060106350854/reviews
Nicholas Ho,4,"Steak was at the correct doneness level
Good flavour
Decadent bowl was just right for a taster platter of the Denver beef and Brussels sprouts

Burger was wholesome and tasted complete w the pickles and fillers. Good for a big eater

Atmosphere wise had to get outdoor seats. Ongoing Reno and so not a fair call to comment.

Service staff were knowledgeable, helpful, attentive. Well done",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101542378483037351001/reviews
Kai,4,"The steak was average in terms of tenderness, but a smokey flavour was imparted during the cooking and it paired well with the mustard. The dishes were visually appealing and service was decent. I heard that the view was good, but currently renovations are obstructing it.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108614985895685442854/reviews
Dominic Neo,5,"Excellent value. The Denver in medium rare is the steak to go for. Sides were very decent; the brussel sprouts were sweet and crunchy but a tad oily. Service was great - not pushy, knowledgeable, brisk and polite. Ambiance leaned towards the casual side especially with the ongoing renovation in the mall but we had a good time. Will be back!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115989681501664683988/reviews
Chew Jin Cheng,3,"Flat Iron, Brussel Sprouts, Sourdoughâœ…âœ…
Sourdough was yummy w the butter, do not need to get the raclette cheese.
Comparing the flat iron and the ribeye, I think the flat iron is good enough, need not pay $8 more for ribeye.
The brussel sprouts pricey for $14 as portion is small but its v good!

Service can be much friendlier, esp how people without reservations are treated.

Errr atmosphere ig will get better after the renovations!

The Chef's Cut (188 for 400g) looked damn gooood though, esp the crust. If only all steaks were as well crusted. Will come back when Im feeling richer to try thatðŸ¤©",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111891452873567874519/reviews
