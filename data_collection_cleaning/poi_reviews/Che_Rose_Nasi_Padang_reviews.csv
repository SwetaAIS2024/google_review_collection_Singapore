FRan,3,"The dishes taste normal. Nothing special. But price on the high side. The chicken size was rather small, small serving with their vegetables plus one potato, charging at $7.80. My first and last time. eating here.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114274074411845672874/reviews
IVAN LIM,3,"Tried this stall for the first time. Food was tasty & not bad. But the main downside is their high (food) prices for a heartland coffee shop stall. Ordered fried chicken wing, an egg, sambal goreng and Lady's fingers. Portions were quite small, considering the price that I paid. Don't be mistaken by my photo, the plate looks full cos there was a lot of curry on it :)

Damage was $9.50.

Usually I would be paying max $7 - $8 for such a combi elsewhere, with some places even charging closer to $6.

Definitely way above many similar stalls in coffee shops.

Will be my first & last visit there.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116819297520299525204/reviews
Melvin L.,2,"2 plates for $19! One with chicken n 2 veg, the other chicken, sotong n veg.. the portion of each was small as pic. Definitely overpriced!

Even the more expensive Kopitiam nasi Padang has bigger portion and more atas to demand this price!

Food was tasty and was cooked hours ago.. not even warm!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110421645909471120923/reviews
cys edi,5,Nice nasi padang. The beef rendang is good and traditional. Rempah of the rendang is great and fresh. Ask for extra gravy for rendang as it is more traditional dry style. Other dishes is good too. They are generous with the gravies so that added complexity to the dish. I think firstly the dishes are traditional and what dish we choose to balance with each other is important. It is almost the same for all nasi padang too. Overall it is a great gem for authentic nasi padang. Well done!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107131397450451441290/reviews
Wong S Y,1,"Food is delicious. My fave Nasi Padang since i was a little boy.
But recently prices have seem to increase every few months by $0.50-$1 and now itâ€™s a luxury food for me.
Rice, Beef Rendang and Sambal Goreng $7 now as compared to few months back with same dish and 1 Begedil $7.20 ðŸ˜Œ",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114813024284928952892/reviews
