stamp stamp,5,"I tried ordering from this boss pizza because my friend recommended it. It was very delicious. It's the thin crust type that I like. If you don't like thin crust, you can skip it. But the taste is fresh and made pizza. Highly recommended üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100700920003031110657/reviews
HY F,4,"No pork/lard used. They get creative with duck and chicken pepperoni etc in the absence of pork ingredients. Thin ‚Äúbiscuit‚Äù like dough is not my preference for thin crust pizza. The spicy chicken wings is delicious and the star of my takeaway.

Extra * - the lady on duty is lovely, warm and friendly. The offer of 20% off the whole menu for walk ins as well as buy 2, 1 free is wallet friendly.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112791788110149101774/reviews
Mad Mumbles,5,"I stopped in for a very warm welcome and pizza with The Boss at The Boss Pizza on the weekend and had a great time and a great feed üòã. The spicy beef pepperoni was cooked to perfection with crispy base and crust, and lashings of tasty melted mozzarella.

The new owner is super friendly and helpful and told me all about the exciting changes he's made to the shop and the new menu which has something for everyone including some very exciting pizzas like crab meat, and floss!

All the ingredients are fresh and the sauce is handmade authentic style. While I was there The Boss kept busy preparing orders and chatting with me despite being so busy. I saw several other pizzas go out for orders and had food envy even though I'd already enjoyed my pepperoni pizza! ü§§ I'm looking forward to trying all the other pizzas and sides!

Thanks Boss - see you again soon!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108904523230632311139/reviews
