      "text": "Tried the crispy chicken with ciabatta bread at Hans’ Café for the first time and was quite disappointed. The chicken was extremely dry, and the ciabatta bread didn’t seem freshly baked—it looked and tasted more like it was pan-fried. Instead of proper cooked potato chips, they served packaged chips that were overly salty and felt out of place with the dish. For the price, I expected much better quality. Unfortunately, I don’t recommend this dish and won’t be ordering it again.",

Pork chop looks dull but meat is actually v tender n juicy 5*. \"Never judge a book by its cover.\" Beef stew is v fatty. 2 big chunks of fats to be discarded as there's nothing to eat... omelette is forever cold. Salad/Coleslaw by d side of omelette tastes raw n dull -1*. I'd rather be served d baked beans, like my pork chop.\n\nOutlet is v v warm. There's a lot of heat felt even though we weren't seated close to d kitchen.",

There many other F&B at Novena which has way better customer service than Han's.\n\nCake is not tasty at all.\n\nVery bad.... In all aspect.",
