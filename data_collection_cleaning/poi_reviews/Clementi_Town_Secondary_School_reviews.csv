Bettyboop,2,"The badminton CCA teacher and coach tend to use a harsh, punitive approach rather than encouragement, which makes students feel very stressed. No wonder the badminton team hasn't been performing well in the NSG, even after recruiting many DSA students.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111974646928612847079/reviews

Gerrard Kwek,5,"Most in fact ALL teachers here are amazing, please consider this school. As a student graduating this year from this school, I can confirm that the school includes many holistic development activities. One of which stands out to me is the ""end of term cohort activities"" like ""CT got talent"" at the end of terms 1,2 and 4, which shapes a child, by providing them with knowledge on the arts and understanding of things outside of academic lesson. I am the 2nd generation of my family to be in this school (Clementi Town Secondary School is a pretty new school), and I definitely feel very blessed to have spent my past 4 years of education here.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100996407967097485790/reviews
Kok Kum Fai,1,"Several incidents of students behaving badly around and inside Clementi Mall.

Many potty mouthed as well as loud mouth.

Schools have a duty to inculcate in students an ability to articulate unpleasant matters in a direct yet civil and polite manner. It's about developing good communication skills.

Because they may grow up to be cowards who are unable to voice frustrations directly, and so resort to dropping sly hints to harass people.

Even worse, they may get children to drop sly hints on their behalf.  And pass on this negative character trait.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114333752803125042296/reviews
