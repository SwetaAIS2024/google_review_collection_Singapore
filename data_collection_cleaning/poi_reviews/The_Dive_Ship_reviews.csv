Ryan Soh,5,"Massive thank you to The Diveship, especially to Instructor and Divemaster Jason. Great organiser, teacher and leader who not only possesses a great depth of knowledge regarding Diving but experience within the diving community and familiarity with foreign dive sites.

In particular during our Bali Trip, he displayed not only remarkable knowledge on scuba diving and free diving, but also on the local wildlife, navigation, depth tables and the such. His leadership and expertise gave my friends and I a sense of security in unfamiliar waters

Definitely a one-of-a-kind instructor",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112492365899642443658/reviews

kangyu koh,5,"I recently had the pleasure of diving with dive instructor Jason, and I can confidently say it was one of the most well-organized and enjoyable dive trips I've experienced. From the start, everything was meticulously planned, including a detailed itinerary that covered the entire trip, comfortable accommodations, and great dining options.

Jason is both professional and highly competent, with extensive knowledge of the underwater terrain. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned diver, Jason teaches essential techniques, especially for freediving like how to hold your breath, in a way thatâ€™s easy to understand. Heâ€™s also extremely observant, pointing out creatures as tiny as a shrimp, sometimes no bigger than a tenth of a finger segment. This keen eye helps divers notice more marine life, making each dive even more enjoyable.

Every dive with Jason feels like both an adventure and a learning experience. I highly recommend diving with him, youâ€™ll come away feeling confident and already looking forward to your next trip!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107108103539914780533/reviews
Isaac Heng,5,"I took the PADI Rescue, Divemaster and Assistant Instructor course under the Dive Ship this year. The training was fun and  professionally conducted. When undergoing the different courses, I learnt a lot from Course Director Jason who was helpful and able to answer the queries I had. The Bali dive trip I had was also fuss-free and well planned! I am pleased to say I trusted the right Dive Centre to do my professional scuba diving courses!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104678313311245988139/reviews
