Celestine Low,2,"No doctor but it was not stated on the website or in google. Called them but no answer, only found out got no doctor after walking all the way there. When i told them they never answer their call, they said they have been answering.

Shawn Ng,5,Doctor Sukvinder Singh is an excellent and patient doctor! He also educated me in what was happening with clarity. I would come here again if I had any medical issue. Receptionists are patient and nice too!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105508784688630305700/reviews
Kim Jin,1,"Please do not come to this clinic for GP if u have any other options !!! 🤦🏽‍♀️😡😡😡😡😡

2nd time here for me out of no choice, as it’s open early 8:30 am and near my place. Need medicine urgently.

I arrived 8:30 am, the doc is out for toilet break, I didn’t to see the doc until the moment I left the clinic 9:09am, very professional !

Reception is rude and arrogant ! No empathy towards that you are sick, very cold, plus long waiting period, the doc is good. Overall don’t recommend this place.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107714610201186461484/reviews
Anmol Jain,4,"Dr. Singh is a very friendly and professional doctor!
Not giving 5 stars just because while registering i was told there were 2 patients ahead of me, ended up being 4 instead of 2 and the reason given to me was the other patients made an ""appointment"". I ended up waiting 1+ hour (friday morning which is not even peak hour) when i badly needed the pain meds. Clinic seems to have provision for maintaining a queue system, would recommend them to use the system for more transparency. If i ever visit again, it surely will not be without an appointment",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116282388177873499415/reviews
xiaowei shi,1,"One star for the patient and helpful reception girl and Dr Singh and the deduction of stars is for the rude relief dr I have ever met during my visit in 8 November afternoon. Firstly after I went in and said hi, i was abruptly asked “ your name” and the doctor’s tone was cold and dismissive throughout the consultation. His comments about my condition and my presence at work came across as judgmental and accusatory. No effort was made to establish personal connection, furthermore he ended the consultation with “Go home and do not spread the virus to others!” Anyway seriously concern the quality, professionalism this clinic group selecting their relief doctors given how disrespectful experience I have gone through. Suggest call first to avoid the suffer.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112150237539958759515/reviews
