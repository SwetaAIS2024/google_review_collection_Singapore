Andy Tamlin,5,"I bought a pair of Nevada's from Krushers about a month ago. So far they have been amazing. I have worked in damp, muddy and flooded areas. So having complete waterproofing, yet remarkably comfortable for this price range is unheard of. And they're pretty stylish too. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a pair of work boots.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101227749280228178968/reviews
