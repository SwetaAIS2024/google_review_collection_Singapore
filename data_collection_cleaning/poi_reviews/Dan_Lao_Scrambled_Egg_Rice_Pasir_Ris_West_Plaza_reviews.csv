A C,2,"2.5 stars at best. Chicken cutlet was pre prepared and it was cold to eat. Fried egg was too oily and greasy. Overall taste was nothing out of the ordinary.

Sorry for the ""negative"" or over critical review. But since it was marketed quite well in terms of its visuals, i thought it was important to let others know how the food taste",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113592239400547470392/reviews

Jacob TAN,3,"New stall at this NTUC Foodcourt. So decided to give it a try after reading good review for it's Maxwell original stall. Ordered the fried chicken egg rice dish. The fried chicken is nice with good har cheong taste and is crispy on the outside. However, the chicken is a little dry. The rice is too soft for me. The egg is done right but is super oily. Service person is unfriendly. Won't be patronising the stall again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
Meng Huat Ho,4,"Ordered the Chicken Cutlet Scrambled Egg Rice. Just nice, not too salty or cold. The chicken meat has a taste of Har Cheong flavour. Wish they could add more variety.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107377942872865451027/reviews
