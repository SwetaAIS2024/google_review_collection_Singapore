Gijs van Seggelen,5,"While the physical space isn't the most comfortable, my first visit to Mr. Youtiao was quite positive. The food was tasty and well-prepared, including the curry. The standout, however, was the friendly and efficient service provided by the counter staff. Considering the quality of the food and service, the prices were very fair.

Addition for the owner: The staff who served us is in the picture. It was on 4 Dec '24 around 18.30",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115096189213265221456/reviews
Elaine Quek,1,"This place is overpriced. The youtiao is only so so....I mean what can go wrong with fried youtiao. We ordered a sets. The century egg porridge was very mediore. The tomyum noodles were poor quality,  are probably straight out of an instant noodle pack but each set is $10.50.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103201350123704289751/reviews
timothy lee,5,"Taken lots of curry from different places, but the curry chicken here is excellent and nice. The chicken is not over cooked. Surprise you tiao had different kinds - normal, sesame, almond...not bad at all. You tiao not too hard, it is tasty and good. Appreciate the staff to check how sweet I would like my bean curd. Definitely recommend this place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104322212189177084410/reviews
X,5,Have been a regular customer for the past 4 months and really enjoyed my time there. The auntie always remembers my order and never fail to greet me in the morning. Assam fish can be a little sour at times and the space can be tight during lunch hours but other than that it's alright. Will definitely miss the auntie when I'm no longer working nearby to patronise the shop,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108051621443972734979/reviews
Wendy L,1,"This serving guy very rude and careless, He dropped the banana twice on the table. I said I don't want, then he rolls his eyes and said it's clean. Thanks female staff Who told him to give me a new one. But the guy in the end gives me the cold banana.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100696694923370864528/reviews
