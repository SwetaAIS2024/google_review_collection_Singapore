Tsoi Ka Man,5,"Tried the ANW Japanese Korean cuisine. Ordered Kimchi Soup with pork.
It's really nice.
Will come back again.

Anne Hui Ni,2,"Hard to find table. Asked for Char Siew noodles 2 plates + 2dollars chicken meat total 12.60? But look at the portions of chicken, I think they are chop 5 dollars ya?",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104503315007400994006/reviews
Jun Kai,2,"Overpriced eggs. Order 3 eggs and it costs $4.10. the water wasn't hot enough for the eggs, and still came out 90% raw, despite being in it for 10 mins.

The China noodles stall was generous with portion size, but tastes very mediocre - great for filling but is only something to eat to save money when passing through and in a rush.

Otherwise, there's nothing good about this place.

Final verdict: Skip this hawker centre.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116988250543618787949/reviews
Vivian,4,"The red oil wanton from the la mian store is nice and juicy and the sauce is super good üòç the chicken chop la mian was not bad but the chicken was cold. Noodles are handmade and nice and chewy. The portion sizes are incredibly generous too. The yong tau foo stall seems very popular, will try that next time.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100236846615197197324/reviews
