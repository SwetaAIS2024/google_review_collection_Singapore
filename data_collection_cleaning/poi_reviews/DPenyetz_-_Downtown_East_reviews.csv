atrina lim,4,I took lvl 3 normal chilli spice and it was way above my limit. I find mc spicy spicy so u shld be able to gauge my spice lvl. Probably taking lvl 2 green chili the next round. Lvl 1 tastes like some nasi lemak chilli. Anyway the cheesy chicken was so tough n dry but we finished it. IWould come again for the promfrets! Its about 9+ to 11+ per meal.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101392772516196143940/reviews
Ritz Bitz,3,"Tucked in the corner of Downtown East basement, D Penyetz has a very good ans accessible location. The menu options seem very exciting and varied and I like that there are spice level options too.

Unfortunately the dish I ordered was disappointing. The beef rib was completely dry and overcooked. Making it very difficult and unpleasant to eat. Big regret especially since I also consider it a very expensive option.

However I will return and try on other items in the menu. Perhaps  hopefully the meat will be juicier compared to the terrible beef rib.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110358387947738376597/reviews
Xling Tang,4,"Serve authentic Indonesian food just like what we ate in Indonesia. Sometime ago, we visited and ordered two sets of D’Penyetz smashed chicken (ayam penyet D’Penyetz), which were authentic and flavorful. The sambal at normal spicy (level 3 premium shrimp paste chili sauce) was spicier than the normal spicy level at other places. If you can't handle spicy food, consider choosing mild (mild chili sauce) or medium spicy (minang green chili sauce).

We also ordered Javanese chicken soto (soto ayam lamongan) for my kids, and they loved it.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103954248798037993511/reviews
