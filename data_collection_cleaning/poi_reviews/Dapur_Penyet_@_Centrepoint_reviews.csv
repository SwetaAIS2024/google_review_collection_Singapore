penny,3,"the dancing fish was very nicely fried and crispy! but it lacked in the flavour department. there was no sauce so it was a bit challenging to finish :( the chilli sauce was way more spicy than i could tolerate 😭 so i couldn’t eat much of it

the star of the show was definitely the brinjal 🍆🤩 full of flavour and not overly mushy! by itself, it bumped up my rating by .5!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104198052626816980862/reviews
usman shaikh,4,"A bit inside in the mall but perfect location if you want to have some food with great ambiance and peace.
Very neat and clean, tables n chairs have decent space in between each other.
Service staff was very welcoming and served everyone with professional behaviour and a smiling face.
The food is awesome, tasty, good quantity and specially presentation is great.
A lady worker was constantly cleaning the floor and tables. Some of the desperate tourists purposely used their rare gate to pass through the walk way from the mall to the adjoining street, and left the door open but staff did not say them any thing and politely went n close the door.
A must visit and highly recommended place to taste halal food in the downtown Singapore.
You will not find easily such a budget food with high ambiance, taste and Halal in Downtown area.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112757541418460251428/reviews
M *,4,"Kangkung belachan, freshly made, is incredibly delicious. The grilled chicken is also good, although the chili sauce could be spicier. It’s not self-serve, but the staff is attentive and maybe will happily provide more",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103330821176864508073/reviews
jessie lee,1,"Today, I went to this restaurant with my son and my helper; our number was 3. We ordered 2 ayam penyet and 1 gado-gado . The service is very bad because they missed our order and were very late in preparing it. The staff is not good because, even though they prepared our food very late, they never apologized or said ""sorry."" What's more, one of the staff shouted at me when the food were ready , ""Kaka, take your order, number 3.""

The gado-gado tastes okay, but the ayam penyet is really salty. I am not sure if the ayam is fresh or overcooked . Most drinks are out of stock; they just offered me canned drinks or mineral water.
Very Disappointed 😔",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108583146065047607174/reviews
