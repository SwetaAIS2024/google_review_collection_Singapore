Martin Yeo,5,"One of the better tasting fried chicken wings in SG, and to be dipped in their great tasting chilli sauce. Eat them plain or together with the fried Bee Hoon noodles for a tasty and delicious meal. Anytime of the day.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107217464996017596553/reviews
AC Chan,3,"It looks yum but sadly it isn’t. So what went wrong? Alas, the regular size chicken wing was not crunchy at all and the meat just lacked flavour.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Pinky,5,Underrated fried chicken wing and bee hoon. Economical pricing. 3 chickW and 1 bee hon cost $6 only. This stall really look simple like any other econ beehon stall but I promise the bee hon is much much more tasty than it looks. FCW is like the homely tasty taste. Highly recommended.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116491115016562593422/reviews
Daniel Sin,4,This coffee shop has safe entry so more than 2 pax can be seated together. There is a famous economic bee hoon stall that sells chicken wing that taste good. Price is reasonable too.

gav l,1,"I placed an order at this store earlier in the afternoon, requesting to pick it up at 5 PM. I arrived at 5:10 PM, expecting the order to be ready as agreed. However, upon arrival, I was told to wait a “short while,” with no clear indication of how long it would actually take. After sitting there and waiting without updates, I eventually realized that the preparation time would take 1.5 hours — a discovery that could have been avoided with proper communication.

When I called earlier to place the order, I was not informed that payment was required in person before the food could be prepared. This key detail was only revealed when I asked the staff at the counter, long after I had already arrived. Had I known this policy upfront, I could have made alternative arrangements or adjusted my plans accordingly.

The lack of communication and transparency created significant frustration and led to a wasted trip, as I had driven 45 minutes to collect an order that should have been ready. Instead, I was left waiting for 1.5 hours without any indication of this delay beforehand. I hope the store reviews its communication process to provide customers with accurate expectations and avoid similar inconveniences in the future.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103392845227437331427/reviews
