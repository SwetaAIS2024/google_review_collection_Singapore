Simon Yeo,5,Dr Johnathan Chong is professional and knowledgeable. He gives good advice and you feel at ease talking to him. He talks to you and care like a friend.

Lynnie F,5,"Dr Jonathan Chong is an excellent doctor. His bedside manners? Impeccable. So nice & polite, non-judgmental, respectful.
In fact I don’t think I’ve ever seen a GP who is this nice in my life.

He’s also extremely gentle & careful when drawing blood & doing other examinations. Due to my chronic illness I have to get my blood test every few months, and it’s always a pleasant and painless experience.

How I wish all doctors were like this!

This is clearly a doctor who loves & takes pride in his work.

Even though DTAP is a bit more pricey than the typical GP clinic, but honestly I’d happily pay more for this level of healthcare.

Only downside is sometimes the clinic counter staff can be rather curt & unfriendly. So there’s certainly room for improvement there.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102482080247285975295/reviews
