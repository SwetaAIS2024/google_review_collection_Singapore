Frederick Tan,4,"Zi Jia Yong Tau Foo: A Satisfying & Customizable Meal at Singapore Expo

Zi Jia Yong Tau Foo at Singapore Expo offers a welcome respite from the usual fast-food options, providing a customizable and generally satisfying meal experience. During a recent visit, I appreciated the variety of fresh ingredients on display, allowing for a tailored bowl of this local favourite.

The selection at Zi Jia is quite extensive, featuring a colourful array of stuffed tofu, vegetables, fishballs, and various other delectable morsels. The ingredients looked fresh and well-maintained, which is always a good sign. The process of choosing your preferred items and watching them be cooked in the clear, flavourful broth is part of the Yong Tau Foo charm, and Zi Jia delivers on this front.

The broth itself was alright. It wasn't overly salty or MSG-laden, which I appreciated. The cooking was done well, with each piece cooked just right – the tofu remained tender, the vegetables still had a slight bite, and the fishpaste were bouncy.

I opted for a mix of the classic stuffed tofu (both the fried and the soft versions), some bitter gourd, lady's fingers, and beancurd.

The accompanying chilli sauce provided a nice kick, adding a layer of heat and complexity to the otherwise mild flavours. The sweet sauce option was also available for those who prefer a sweeter profile.

While I enjoyed my bowl of Yong Tau Foo, I couldn't help but think of a couple of additions that would have elevated the experience even further. It would have been particularly nice to have the option of adding a small serving of boiled soya beans on the side. The subtle nuttiness and slightly firm texture of boiled soya beans often complement the various Yong Tau Foo ingredients beautifully, adding another dimension to the meal.

Similarly, a sprinkle of freshly chopped spring onions as a garnish would have been a welcome touch. The fresh, mild onion flavour and vibrant green colour would not only enhance the visual appeal but also add a refreshing element to the overall taste. These simple additions, I believe, would cater to a wider range of preferences and further enhance the authenticity of the Yong Tau Foo experience.

Despite these minor suggestions, Zi Jia Yong Tau Foo offers a satisfying and relatively healthy meal option within the bustling environment of Singapore Expo. The freshness of the ingredients, the flavourful broth, and the ability to customize your bowl make it a worthwhile choice. It's a reliable spot for a quick and fulfilling meal, especially if you're looking for something beyond the typical Expo fare.

I look forward to my next visit and hope that perhaps, in the future, we might see the addition of boiled soya beans and fresh spring onions to further enhance the already enjoyable Yong Tau Foo experience at Zi Jia.

steven lim,3,"Not the best YTF I have had, and certainly not the worst. But it could be better, as one of the tofu tasted slightly stale, though the fish paste was okay.

The fried stuff were okay, but the display did attract quite a number of flies.  They need to figure out how to keep the flies away, perhaps by having an electric zapper mounted at the stall.

The lady staff was friendly, and the noodles were cooked al dente, which was good.;",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117434407303387249783/reviews
Aura N,1,"The food here is actually good. We have been eating at this stall since the food court was under Timbre. However, after our two recent visits, I ended up with stomachache after eating the YTF here. Service was horrible as well. Lady at the stall gave us an irritated look on her face for asking the food to be taken away when it was already mentioned right from the start and she probably didn’t hear. Not that hard to transfer the food from a bowl to a takeaway container right? We were the only customers at that time as well.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115299986745709627079/reviews
Joe Lim,2,Laksa taste was decent. But the rest of the ingredients were quite bad. Fishball was so hard and didn't taste fresh. Fried ingredients all didn't taste fresh.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114287126716864695617/reviews
