Rebecca Wiener,5,"Chose Dr. Priya several years ago for my Accutane treatment, and I couldn't be more grateful for her expertise. Thanks to her guidance, my acne is now under control, and my skin looks the best it ever has. New friends are often surprised when I show them photos of my skin before treatment‚Äîit's hard to believe how much it‚Äôs improved!

Most recently, Dr. Priya helped me with a cyst that developed on my body. As always, she was professional and provided effective treatment that brought me relief quickly. The cyst has now healed fully and is no longer on my mind.

I have also used her face moisturiser as well ever since my first visit. It works well for my skin!

I highly recommend Dr. Priya to anyone struggling with skin issues. She‚Äôs someone you can trust to provide personalised, effective care.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106398159422788314025/reviews
Shivani Retnam,5,"Dr P has helped me with a number of skin issues, but most recently I have been so amazed by the tablets for hair loss that Dr P collaborated with Moom on. I have struggled with hair loss for some time and tried so many things. After I started taking these tablets, it‚Äôs the first time that my hair has actually stopped dropping. I don‚Äôt know how those pills worked their magic, but I am so very grateful!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104945635376216287487/reviews
Kaoru Fujiwara,5,"I've been a patient of Dr. Priya Sen for many years now, seeking her care whenever I have skin concerns.

ruby gaba,5,"My experience with Dr Priya Sen has been extremely fruitful.
I thank God that I found her.
She is one of the best doctors I have come across. She is one extremely experienced , knowledgeable, polite, sympathetic and understanding dermatologist.
I had severe facial acne with blood and pus in it  ..it was really bad... but Dr Priya gave me a new refreshing skin with her high-quality products and treatment.
She helped me gain my confidence back, which I was losing before consulting her.
She followed all the protocols and measures before starting her treatment and understood the problem well and then prescribed the medicines and products required depending strictly upon the condition of my skin.
And now my skin is shiny and smooth  with zero acne...I am smiling again.

I have total faith in her treatment so much so that I took my teenager to her without an iota of doubt for his severe acne problem.
And the results are amazing....hands down...as expected!!
His acne is gone, and the skin is beautiful and smooth again!
I am happy to see him happy and confident again.

I am really thankful to her for giving me and my son a new beginning .....she is simply amazing.

I truly highly, highly recommend her to all those who are looking for a genuine, knowledgeable dermatologist with excellent treatment,  products, and the results!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116256442110233008507/reviews
