Gerald Cox II,5,"The Raintree dental clinic saved my trip! My veneer came off while eating and I was fortunate to find this clinic within walking distance from my hotel! The staff was incredibly professional, understanding, and accommodating, and they got me in to immediately place my veneer back in an emergency procedure looking better than before. I highly recommend them to anyone seeking exceptional dental care. Thank you so much for taking care of me during my stay in Singapore!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103189877353216095597/reviews

YS L,5,"Clinic is clean, well equipped and comfortable. There's even TV playing movie in front of the chair + on the ceiling to keep u occupied and distracted. Toilet is clean and nice. Dentists are skilled, detail oriented, and gentle. They did a good job. So are the assistants and other staffs. Reception staffs are friendly and personalized, made efforts to remember your face, name and background. During first consultation, dentist did detailed & thorough check & teeth cleaning. For my teeth cavity filling, i was surprised that the anaesthesia injection doesn't hurt much compared to my previous experiences. The injection + drilling+  filling process is generally painless & quite smooth. Pleasant with the results too.

Bala Krishnan,5,"From the time I was given an emergency dental appointment personally by Dr Carol 2 years ago (when no other dentist in the area could accommodate), she and raintree have never failed to WOW me in their pre, post and dental care / treatment.

Ally who manages the front counter with calls, bills and coordinating with the dentists, is always patient and tries hard to accommodate our appointment needs each and every time ..

keep up the good work !",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106001616483168859503/reviews
