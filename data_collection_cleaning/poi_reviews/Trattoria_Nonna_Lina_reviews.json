A restaurant with minimalistic decor but serving food bursting with flavors.\nThe fresh salad, lasagna, crab pasta and Tiramisu were outstanding. Enjoyed a nice quiet evening and also got some food tips from Simone, their chef üòÄ",

      "text": "Service - 5 stars\nStaff were very friendly and attentive. Thank you!\n\nComplimentary bruschetta\nCame with a rye bread.\n\nSoup of the day - seafood bouillabaisse ($30) - 3.5 stars\nSlightly on the fishy side for me.\n\nPappardelle al Ragu Toscani ($46) - 5 stars\nThe star of the night and simply the best ragu I've had. To be fair I don't eat much ragu and often choose seafood over meat dishes as I find meat too gamey. The sauce was on point - it had the perfect balance of umami, acidity and sweetness that made me keep wanting to eat more. The handmade pappardelle was on the softer side.\n\nPenne al Granchio ($48) - 4.25 stars\nI've had a lot of crab pasta and this was one of the better ones. They were so generous with the crab meat there was practically more meat than pasta. The crab didn't taste fishy at all and the sauce was flavourful. My only gripe is the penne - it tasted almost wholemeal and was on the harder end of al dente. I'm not a big fan of penne as well and would personally have preferred a linguine or their handmade pappardelle. The pink cream sauce did get a little jelak towards the end.\n\nTiramisu ($21) - 3.75 stars\nWe loved that they gave a Real Slice. I haven't had tiramisu in a while - this wasn't too sweet for me throw my husband thought it was a little too sweet. Could barely taste the alcohol. Tasted more like whipped cream than mascarpone.",
