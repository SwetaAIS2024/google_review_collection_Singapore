The egg is cooked perfectly , just nice with a sunny egg yolk on top of rice. So shiok! And it blend well with the rice and meat.\nAnd don‚Äôt miss the moo ping!  Juicy, smoky, super fragrant. It goes really well with the sauce and lime on the side ok.  If you love Thai food, you must try this stall. Confirm plus chop, you‚Äôll come back again and again! Don‚Äôt think Liao guys. üòèüòèüòç Even my younger brother also love it u know!",

      "text": "First time having ngam ngiao, Northern Thai Laksa. Tangy soupy broth, fresh toothsome coarse ground meatballs, very interesting and neutral flavoured red cotton tree flower aka dok ngio and fresh, crunchy AF pork rinds. Vermicelli is more to coarse mee suah texture vs stringy bee hoon. Very much like the ones used in Burmese mohinga. I'll do this anytime.\n\nPad krapow is good, would prefer it a little spicier and saucier but that's just me.\n\nMoo ping is a standout. There are good moo ping and this one is great. Was told that it's a mixed of 80:20 meat to vege ratio. Juicy and perfectly caramelised. I'll order this for parties man.\n\nPork rinds so good I dabao'ed a bag home.",
