Yeo Shin,5,"The tutors are not only knowledgeable but also approachable, often taking the time to greet students individually and create a relaxed learning environment. For instance, I struggled alot in secondary school with science and english. One of my tutors, Mr Tan, patiently explained it multiple times until I understood it. He also made himself available outside of class hours for additional guidance, which greatly improved my grasp of the subjects and gave me the confidence to do well in my O levels. His support has significantly enhanced my learning experience, making me feel valued and encouraged as a student.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110875750561539672014/reviews
Noel Wong,5,"My son is having his tuition here. Adrian shows great patience for slower learners like my son who has just come from a foreign country. Engages parents to do home work together with son, ensuring a total learning experience. My son now speaks basic English fluently, and I hope he can continue to learn from Adrian.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115505132394689214632/reviews
Maggie Wong,5,"I have sent my three children here for about 7-8 years already. I’ve seen their grades skyrocket from a few lessons! My youngest, 12, who took her PSLE this year told me that the strategies and techniques taught were really useful in her exams! I recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a fun learning experience, all while able to learn something new.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114154345276085093058/reviews
