Izham Sham,5,"Spacious units... Mine is a 2 bedroom and 2.5 washrooms unit. Serviceable kitchen, laundry area and storeroom. Gated area with smart tag-type entry, large-ish swimming pool and gymnasium. Quite well kept maintenance-wise, though covered parking area gets quite dark i.e. Could use more lighting.. Mydin shopping just a stone's throw away (but driving there entails a lengthy u-turn). Next to it is a Subway and 23hr mamak restaurant. All in all a very pleasant place to live in.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113456048345480086677/reviews
