Wei Xin,5,The Mala xiang guo stall in this coffee shop is fantastic. We purchased stir fry pork slices and mala xiang guo. Both taste great and ingredients are all very fresh. They are currently having lunch set promotion from $6.50. They comes with free bowl of rice and soup.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109559116655681018940/reviews

William Lu,5,"Newly opened coffee shop it seems. I just recently moved around this area and first time visited here with many flowers for opening.

I tried kolo mie here and it was ok. Will try other shops as well at here. It was still clean as it is new.

It wasn't that crowded for lunch, I think it is due to many coffee shops around here as well.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
Jane,1,"The thosai from the prata and briyani stall is one of the worst I've tried. It's paper thin, lacks any fragrance and just tastes sour. They don't provide the usual dipping sauce for thosai either. It's just prata curry.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110058648348592408638/reviews
