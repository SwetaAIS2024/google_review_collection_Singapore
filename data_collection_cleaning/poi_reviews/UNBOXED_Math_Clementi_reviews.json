They are also very friendly, so their students won‚Äôt be afraid to text or ask them enquiries. The teachers at Unboxed even keep track of their students‚Äô test dates so that they can fully prepare them for the exam. I am super grateful to my math tutor, Teacher Faith. She‚Äôs an absolutely dedicated and amazing teacher. Through her guidance, I was able to pull my hopeless math grades up to an A2!!! It‚Äôs a great tuition Centre, and I would recommend it :)",

      "text": "My daughter enrolled in UNBOXED math (Clementi Branch) when she was primary 5 after term 2 after she scored badly for her math weighted assesment 1 and got AL5. After since, she joined UNBOXED, she improved significantly and got AL1 for her weighted assesment 2! After seeing her amazing results and improvement, I was immediately impressed by UNBOXED teaching! After that, my daughter continued to ace her exams, she even got AL1 for her end of year exams! Even though this is partly because of her effort, i know UNBOXED teacher Lovey has also helped her in improving, thank you so much UNBOXED for helping my daughter improve!",
