Service staff are patient and will teach you how to eat certain snacks should you require. Atmosphere clean and definitely a good place to chill.",

      "text": "Absolutely recommend people staying nearby to visit!\n\nFood tastes great, place is air conditioned, and price is reasonable.\n\nThe briyani portion is quite big and always comes with an egg. Mee goreng was average and bit oily. Roti prata (w & w/o egg) tastes great. Teh tarik was good too, you can ask for less sweet if you like but the normal sugar level feels alright for me. Blueberry drink feels like blueberry syrup and yogurt (not sure), nice too.\n\nThey are having some promotion now based on their flyer. Come and have a try! Will definitely visit more often.",

Atmosphere is alright, considering thereâ€™s always families with young children making noise in an enclosed air conditioned space\n\nBought the same dishes and can say the taste is not consistent. First visit the naan was crispy even after 20min, visit after was a big difference. Less than a few minutes after and the naan was already soft. Mutton was much spicier, curry was a lot oilier and there was 50% more rice too",
