Jennifer,4,"Splurged for breakfast! Ordered this in via Grabfood because their croffles looked so good and they also offered a variety of drinks. There were so many options I had a hard time narrowing it down to two. In the end, I went with Banana Caramel Crumble and Nutella Marshmallows.

The croffles were priced at about $5 each. They were smaller than expected and rather soft. Would have been nicer if they were more crisp and flaky. That said, I loved the toppings and they matched up well with the iced chocolate. I do think I will try more flavours down the road.

By the way, it’s a home-based business, open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Also, they don’t use pork or lard.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110520605084204408119/reviews
