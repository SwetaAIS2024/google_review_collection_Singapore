The char siew and roasted pork belly were both excellent. While the char siew sauce remained consistent with the main restaurant, the meat was slightly less fatty. The roasted pork was particularly impressive, showcasing a distinct herbal flavour profile. The accompanying chilli sauce was also exceptional.",

Chanced upon Char Express - they claimed to be one-of-a-kind cha siew - and piqued my curiosity. It didn’t disappoint. The cha siew was really the best I’ve ever had. Soft, juicy, flavourful and not eekily sweet. The roast pork was also tender on the inside and crispy on the surface. It came paired with a special mustard sauce and chilli sauce; lethal combination. Overall I had a satisfied hearty meal. The staff there told me Char is opening a full restaurant at Race Course Road soon.",

      "text": "Understand that they just newly opened and today’s their second day. Just find the coordination can be enhanced and their instructions to be provided to chef simply. I ordered double meats and top up w o Sen egg and a drink. The rice was either uncooked or was cooked long time ago and may have left in open as it was hard. I asked for sauces over the rice they said the mustard and chilli suffice. Maybe they did not enjoy their char siew rice w lots of gravy but I think if you were to order pls ask them to put sauce on rice. Is hard. I do find that the amount of meat provided was unable to justify the cost of $8.80.",
