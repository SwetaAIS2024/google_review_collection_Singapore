Black Widow,1,"I would like to create awareness on human behaviour here.

When I walked in as a customer, the shop assistant/ owner treats me nicely and politely. However, when I walked in asking if I can get some recycled boxes. She ignored me somewhat, and told me she can not put aside for me to collect even within 1-2days. She would rather throw them away.

I would really hope the shop assistant/ owner is more aware of ESG and the act of kindness.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109219089222641092178/reviews
