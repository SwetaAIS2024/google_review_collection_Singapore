Gayan Chathuranga,4,"Labrador Park MRT Station is a calm and peaceful station that serves as a gateway to some of Singapore’s hidden gems. It’s conveniently located near the scenic Labrador Nature Reserve, making it perfect for nature lovers and those looking to enjoy a serene walk by the sea.

The station is clean and well-maintained, like most MRT stations in Singapore. It’s not as crowded as the more central stations, which makes it a pleasant stop. However, there aren’t many amenities directly within the station, so it’s best to plan ahead if you’re heading to the park.

The station connects smoothly to key locations via the Circle Line, and the surrounding area has its charm. A great station for anyone exploring the quieter side of Singapore!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115580882753025627106/reviews
Samuel Edyson,4,Fairly new MRT serving the Circle Line. Has standard interior design but walkways and exits on the outside (not too confusing). Small park by the exit so not too hot on sunny day. There is also a connecting bridge to pass through multiple main roads.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108333055052140661429/reviews
Buren,2,Nothing. No amenities as far as I know. Named after a park but situated far away from my experience trying to go there. Outdated map that mentions feeder bus but there was none. Staff was friendly but gave us wrong direction.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103975090698079167241/reviews
