Tan,1,"Ngl Seat conditions quite dirty. Bus timings are quite infrequent for campus rider. Distance from pioneer mrt to the admin building will now need an avg addtional 15 mins of travel time. With Tong Tar the morning buses were much more frequent :/

Update in 2024. Comfort delgro cant seem to deal with peak periods lol. They simply cant. Had to wait close to 40 mins for the green campus rider. You cannot imagine waiting 30 mins for the bus to come and then 1 minute later see 2 buses behind. Real bad planning.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109218786892749779878/reviews
Jane Tan,5,"Coming to 2months, operator have definitely adapted or trying to adapt to the new environment. More buses are deployed during peak hours as compared to day1. Accessibility to the bus stopping buttons may not be easy for most buses, but understand they will be replaced soon. Bunching still occurs but I believe if students were to utilise the bus stopping buttons, situation may improve.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101963791206043342126/reviews
Timoteus,4,"They have been doing better than previous operator in NTU. I see less bunching of buses these days, although it still occurs.
Buses are newer, and more of them are city buses with wider coridoor, though they still deploy a number of coaches. Hopefully it will be better in the coming months.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109908283267038764784/reviews
Jean KW,1,"Service is consistent but slow, wasted a lot of time waiting for the bus, better off walking than wasting your time. CDG should increase the bus frequency, tong tar is better lol. The reason I give 1 star is because of weekend bus service, only 1 bus with snail speed that is serving the whole school and a bunch of students waited 30mins just for a bus that ends service. What a joke.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113423793695724601909/reviews
Pamela Webb,3,"I take the shuttle bus from Hume Park 1 to Bt Batok MRT occasionally usually around 11am. There is one driver who is very grumpy and rude. On one occasion he was texting while driving. Yesterday morning at 11am I waited for the bus. I was the only passenger boarding and greeted him.  No response. And while I was trying to tap my card he was already starting to move off and very angrily he raised his voice at me ""Sit down!  Sit down!"" Why could he have not waited for me to finish tapping my card before driving off?
However, the driver on the next shift when I took the bus from Bt Batok MRT at around 1-45pm is always pleasant and courteous and never in a rush. Nice to be driven and served by such a nice man.
I hope the morning driver can be counseled on his attitude, rudeness and impatience. He should not be doing this job if he is not happy doing it!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111007325389612039787/reviews
