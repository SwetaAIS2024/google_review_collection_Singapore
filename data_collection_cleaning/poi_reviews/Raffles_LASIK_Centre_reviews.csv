Keane Lim,5,"I had a great experience with Dr. Johnson and his wonderful clinic staff when I did LASIK in Dec last year. Dr. Johnson was professional and took the time to explain everything, which made me feel at ease. The staff were kind and caring, ensuring I was comfortable throughout the entire process. Thanks to their excellent care, my LASIK procedure was smooth and successful.
