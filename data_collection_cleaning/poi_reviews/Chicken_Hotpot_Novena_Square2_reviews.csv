Tan Cheng Har,4,"I always use Eatigo to make reservations and enjoy discounts at the same time. They used to have an outlet in Bedok a long time ago, and I really hope they open one in the East again. In my opinion, their chicken hotpot is one of the best in Singapore!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107028620650629758330/reviews
Sandra,4,"Wait staff suggested we order set meal for 2 which include 2 regular pots + 2 rice + 2 drinks. We chose chicken n beef. Hotpot is spicy ü•µüî•üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº Restaurant shd serve iced water foc. We took 2 extra plates fr fridge.

Note d curb. I almost fell when walking to cashier then wait staff reminded me there's a curb. Wait staff like to hurdle n chit chat (or gossip) but they forgot they r in full view of staff. We had to put on our earpods to eat in peace.

Actually I don't know why I m paying service charge when I refilled soup into d pot myself, took d dishes fr fridge myself n walked to cashier myself. I even had to tolerate their gossip coz I was seated at d entrance, also d seat closest to d cashier.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108444186723547263962/reviews
Cindy Tan,4,"Used eatigo for suggestion since I am at square 2. Top notch service from an uncle with great hospitality.
Eatigo discount only applies to 5 types. So I choose their signature chicken hotpot.  It's already cooked in black sauce so it's like braise chicken in Claypot. And the constant cooking thicken the sauce till a point I was grasping for water. Maybe I should added a side item from the fridge and it's not so over power with too much chicken meat.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116706705506549813871/reviews
Wani Madelina,5,Large hotpot is good for 2-3ppl. You can take side dishes from a nearby fridge display. Clean and simple. Soup was thick and slightly salted at first. They offered to add more broth as time flies and it was better. The chicken hot pot was very comforting and it was a great dinner session with my friends.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107589740043131175135/reviews
