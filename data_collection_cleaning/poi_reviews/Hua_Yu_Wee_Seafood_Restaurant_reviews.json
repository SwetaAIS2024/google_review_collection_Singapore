The chilli crab was a standout, and the hot and sour soup was equally scrumptious.  What really impressed me was seeing the owner personally collecting the dishes from the tables. It was a lovely touch and added to the overall warmth of the place.  The complimentary dessert was a delightful surprise, and it perfectly capped off the meal.  I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be returning on my next visit to Singapore.",

Was just boiled and then fried quickly with the black pepper sauce. Sauce did not penetrate in the crab. So when the sauce slides out, seems like it’s tasteless and just eating boiled crabs. Not worth the trip there",

The 10-course menu was thoughtfully curated, and every dish was well-prepared. Our bosses generously hosted the dinner, so I can’t comment on the price, but the overall dining experience was excellent.\n\nThe evening started with the traditional Lo Hei, setting a festive tone. Then came the standout dishes—Lobster with Italian Sauce was absolutely superb, and the Chili Crab was rich and flavorful. One of the highlights for me was the Kurubuta Pork with Romaine Lettuce and Dip—so delicious that I’d definitely come back just for that!\n\nThe service was also commendable. One of the staff members went out of her way to offer various vegetarian options for a colleague, which was greatly appreciated.\n\nWith great food, excellent service, and a lively atmosphere, everyone enjoyed both the meal and the camaraderie. Overall, a memorable experience, and I’d highly recommend this place for group gatherings and special occasions. Looking forward to dining here again!",

Didn't disappoint after so many years. Parking is a challenge; had dinner on a Sun, it was really packed. I think they are understaffed for weekend.",
