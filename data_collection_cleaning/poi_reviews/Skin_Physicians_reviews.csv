Andrea Chew,2,"Just a PSA: I had an appt at 10:30 am, and was not seen until 11:30. I had to wait an HOUR, and they don't tell you this when you start the consultation, but each dermatology appt is scheduled for 15 mins.

Ren Koh,1,"Horrible place. Only come here if you are willing to spend 1+ hour of your life waiting (even if you have an appointment and arrive early).
