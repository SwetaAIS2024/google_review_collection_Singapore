SuperShy Gel,5,"Ice cream cafe with comfort food actually done right.
The egg-drop soup with the signature noodle is amazing and a visual treat. Home-style cooking, simple yet flavourful.
Did not try the ice cream. Will be back.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104772022056749613637/reviews
Patrick Poh,5,Fantastic noodles. My favourite is their soup base. Nice and sweet. Everything just blends so well together. The spicy chilli elevates everything to the next level. Tried their tomato soup which is not bad too. Everything is very valuable for money. It's just $5.8 for the noodles with soup that comes with generous amount of ingredients.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107673184510491093624/reviews

Sze Wee Tan,4,"Found the review of this restaurant from an online review on CNA. They started initially selling Bak Chor noodles in the Tanglin Halt hawker centre before they decide to take over this unit

Located along roll of shophouses, it is a nice stop for coffee and food. There are lots of anime and marvel comics decorated. Cosy and pleasant music in the background. We tried the signature noodle, which have choice of yellow noodle, hor fan or bee hoon with side bowl of soup with egg drop with red spinach. Meat balls, her kiaw and minced meat in very sweet soup. We also ordered a half waffles with triple chocolate ice cream to finish up.

Good experience and recommend to return",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101592249541154985921/reviews
Kok S Lim,5,"Had the signature noodles both dry and soup. A lot of ingredients and it’s was good. Soup can be a bit “clear” compared to what you get in hawkers but that because it’s not over salted so you don’t have a thirsty aftertaste at all.

Also had their ice-cream for dessert and they were good as well. Again not over sweetened so it’s was what we liked.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111085893043935596373/reviews
