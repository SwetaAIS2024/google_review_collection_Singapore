Jon Peng,2,"The kitchen exhaust is quite insufficient.
The dining place is filled with the food smell which stain yr clothes.

Food quality is average.
Mushroom soup is a little lumpy, cream chicken linguinne is watery.

French fries come with the fish and chips is a little dry.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112666739737001299012/reviews
Ef Si,2,"First time to dine. Place is conveniently located in connection one building. Price is on the high side. We have tried the set meal that comes with drinks and soup.

Mushroom soup was bland with mushroom taste. Just a thick, creamy soup with Chopped Mushroom. It was hot, though, which is good. The garlic  bread, I supposed, was so thin and hard.

Rice was undercooked, as can be seen in the photo. It was harder than it's supposed to. The hainanese pork chop was bland and dry. The sauce was more of like sweet and sour. Chicken curry was very ordinary.

The exhaust in the place was not so good either. The smell in the kitchen is all over the place, which stick to our clothes after.

Overall, nothing was good. Price is on the high end for its quality. Except maybe the service. It was kinda assertive and good.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114058229333573288258/reviews
Miklos,4,"Though price is a little on the high side, the food are good and the varieties are aplenty, (chinese, western and pasta) and would make you spoilt for choice!

The fish and chip gave a old school comfort food feel, chicken patty in the chicken burger seems to be handmade and is delicious.

There are lots of seating and the whole area gives a spacious feel!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102392172058235258162/reviews
Monica Seah Jie Ling,5,Coming here really brings back the nostalgia. The place is really clean even though it has been here for a really long time. Props to the staff for scrubbing the chairs during down time. Food is decent and satisfying.

William Lu,4,"Bacon ðŸ¥“ carbonara was good. I liked how creamy and crispy the bacon was. It wasn't crowded at lunch hour and preparation was ok. Didn't take too long from order to collect. Price was reasonable.

Take own cutlery from the collection counter and condiments are from there as well.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
