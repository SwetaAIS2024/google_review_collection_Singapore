SUSAN DANIEL,1,"I was in the shop looking for some things to take home , i was going to buy quite a bit of the products there but as I picked up one of the smallest snow globes on the shelf one fell off and broke and I was made to pay for it , it was only $5.90 but I should not have been made to pay for the product as I clearly did not do it on purpose it fell off as they were close to the edge of the shelf,there is no advertising up saying that if something broke  that it would have to be payed for,needless to say I did not buy anything and neither did my sister in law,we were both quite shocked about the whole incident,I work in retail and the store I work for would not treat the customer as I was treated I am very upset and disappointed about the whole incident, and I sincerely hope that it gets looked into .
