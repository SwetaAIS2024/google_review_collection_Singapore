Don't why the foods here tasted less marinated, cumin or the spice powder? Even the slice beancurd skin also tasted blend, you can even taste the doughy raw beancurd skin taste. The butter on the toast was very spare minimum, in fact it wasted more like a white bread with sugar on it.",

Pro move: Add hand-pulled noodles to soak up that addictive soup – TOTAL GAME CHANGER! 🍜\n\nSkewers? 🔥PERFECTION! Juicy lamb kebabs with crispy edges, smokey charred corn... everything's grilled to order and tastes stupid fresh. Staff even taught me a secret noodle-dipping hack! Spice addicts, this place is your happy place. RUN DON'T WALK! 🦐🍢",
