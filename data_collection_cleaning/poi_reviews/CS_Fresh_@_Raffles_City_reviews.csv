Bruce Aleo,5,"We just had a great shopping experience here at this large supermarket on level one in Raffles City. The store is very clean and well-organized, making it easy to find what we were  looking for.

They had a wide variety of fresh foods, ready-to-eat meals, and delicious snacks and treats The deals they offered were appealing as well.
Definitely worth the visit and considering they have so international food from around the globe there is something for everyone.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109026460475613792164/reviews

식신胖妹-在新加坡,1,"This brand water is disgusting. I bought two bottles, drank half of one, and threw it away. The other bottle is still unopened.
I often drink mineral water, but this is the first time I've bought this brand. I was in a hurry at the time, so just grab it and go.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115584197119085428024/reviews
Flo Yeow,5,"Used to be Jason's Marketplace a long while ago, but the Dairy Farm Group have since consolidated their brands to be much more coherent and consistent. This CS Fresh is large, convenient, and holistic. This outlet does have the core things that most other CS Fresh outlets would carry (fresh produce, groceries, etc), including fresh food stands (salads, sushi, ham and cheese, grilled meats).

Located on the basement of Raffles City, it's connected to City Hall MRT and all the transportation options around; you really can't complain.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
