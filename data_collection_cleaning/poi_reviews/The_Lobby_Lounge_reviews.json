      "text": "If you‚Äôre looking for a whimsical yet elegant high tea experience in Singapore, The Lobby Lounge at Bugis delivers something truly special. The moment the afternoon tea set arrived, I was blown away! It looked like a miniature enchanted forest served in a wooden tray, complete with moss, wooden platforms, and playful details like ladybird chocolates and egg-shaped cups nestled in a bird‚Äôs nest. The presentation was absolutely stunning and clearly crafted with artistry and intention.\n\nEach bite felt like a small masterpiece. The scones were perfectly golden and fluffy, with both plain and raisin options accompanied by rich butter. Savoury selections like the caramelised onion tart and layered potato bites were flavourful and had great textural contrast‚Äîcrispy, smooth, and creamy all at once. The sweet treats were equally delightful: the red velvet mushroom-shaped mousse was both playful and rich, and the macaron was light yet satisfying. The level of detail in every component showed that the chef took real pride in plating and flavour development.\n\nTo top it all off, I had a cold mocha that was so good‚Äîsmooth, chilled, and the perfect balance of coffee and chocolate. It complemented the high tea set beautifully without overpowering the delicate flavours.\n\nOverall, The Lobby Lounge offers more than just a meal; it‚Äôs a full sensory experience. With refined flavours, unique textures, and a fairytale-worthy presentation, this is a spot I‚Äôd absolutely return to for a special treat or a memorable afternoon.",

      "text": "Brought my mom to The Lobby Lounge for a high tea treat ü´ñ and what an experience it was! The Golden Nectar Afternoon Tea was such a luxurious yet relaxing way to spend the afternoon. The space itself was gorgeous ‚ú® super elegant, spacious seating that made us feel comfortable.\n\nWhat stood out most to us was how the whole tea set was infused with the natural richness of Comvita‚Äôs premium New Zealand MƒÅnuka and Gourmet Honeys. It added this subtle, golden sweetness that made each bite feel extra special.\n\nOur top savoury picks? Definitely the Foie Gras and Duck Rillettes on Brioche so rich and perfectly balanced. My mom love the Quiche Lorraine warm, cheesy, with a lovely touch of multifloral honey.\n\nOn the sweet side, we LOVED the Chrysanthemum Honey Pavlova topped with the prettiest meringue honeycomb and chocolate butterfly. And the Pistachio MƒÅnuka Honey Choux Puff? Dreamy\n\nHighly recommended",

Extremely impressed by the service standards, ambience and food quality!\nAppreciate that we were allowed to mix vegetarian and non vegetarian sets to cater to our dining requirements. Was lucky to be assisted by Mr John and Mr Jason who attended to us with excellence and attentiveness. Price is steep, but for the quality of food and service, it is very worth it! Definitely will be back!!",

I wish their coffee was free slow, it was so delicious üòã Preferred their range of savory options as their desserts tended to be too sweet for me and my mum‚Äôs palette. Pastries were also a tad dry. Pleasantly surprised by the birthday cake slice, was not expecting it at all!",
