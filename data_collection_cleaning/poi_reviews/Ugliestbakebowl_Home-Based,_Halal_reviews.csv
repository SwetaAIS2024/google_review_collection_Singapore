ML Choo,5,"I ordered the rice bowls and a burnt cheesecake and i wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The rice bowl had a great balance of flavours and the portion size was incredibly generous. As for the cheesecake, the crispy, slightly bitter char pair perfectly with the cream cheese filing that keeps you coming back bite after bite. Another bonus, it wasn‚Äôt too sweet, which made it even more enjoyable.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116531435330307653035/reviews
alicia chua,5,Do not mistook home based business as being less professional. This home based business produced one of the best burned cheese cake we ever tried. The banana loaf is also a great choice.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288271383785436453/reviews

Whaley Tan,5,"Ordered 9 rice bowls for a gathering. Very kind and sweet lady boss who personally delivered my orders. She is also very meticulous when it comes to vegetarian option, checking with me on the egg or furikake toppings. The portion of each rice bowl was very generous!
