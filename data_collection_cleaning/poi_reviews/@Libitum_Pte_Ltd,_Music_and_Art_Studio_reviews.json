She has also attended their art classes too which were fantastic.  If you want to inculcate your child with the love of classical music, then I can't recommend Libitum more highly.",

The termination of classes was followed by discriminative and insulting messages in private chat.\nAs no apologies instead the teacher of children(!) wrote such answer on my review. I think it's obvious now what kind of place it is. If someone needs approval of my words please don't hesitate to contact me I will provide evidence. Be careful when you choose the right place your children to be taught",
