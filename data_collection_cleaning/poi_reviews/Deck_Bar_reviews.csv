Max S.,5,"Super chill ambience, very relaxing with a good crowd. Drinks are reasonably priced with Guinness and Heineken on tap.

The band that i saw that day was amazing! They were great on soft rock which I absolutely loved!

Will definitely be back again someday to chill out!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101834880193042109600/reviews
cai me,5,"Just somewhere northwestern part from downtown area, you'll see this cozy place right beside the main entance of CT Hub.

If you want to relax, chill, chitchat and catch up with friends, get soothe with a glass or bottle of wine or beer while listening to heart-warming acoustic tunes, this is the place you wouldn't want to miss.

Grunge Ranger,3,"Staff were friendly but they messed up the orders and food was downright horrible. Spaghetti seems like cut into half and not cooked thoroughly thus very hard to chew. Cheese stick taste plain. Nothing interesting when it comes to food. Overall, the food could hv been better. Other than that, drinks were alright.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109208621568062285740/reviews
