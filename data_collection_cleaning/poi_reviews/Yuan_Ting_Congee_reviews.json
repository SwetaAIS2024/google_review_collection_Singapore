      "text": "I had a really unpleasant experience at this porridge stall recently. What happened was after I ordered my food, I asked the elderly man who was preparing the porridge how much it would cost. He didn’t respond, so I asked again, this time a bit louder, thinking he hadn’t heard me. To my surprise, he responded in a loud, rude and sarcastic manner, “Hey miss! I am cooking! can you wait!”\n\nHis tone was uncalled for and left me feeling uncomfortable and unwelcome. While the food might have been decent, the way I was treated completely ruined my experience. It’s unfortunate because good service can really make a difference, but I won’t be returning due to the rude behavior I’ve encountered.",
