Patricia Ou Yong,5,"Nice place to dine in. Good and affordable. We love the tuna tataki salad and garlic bread. The mushroom soup and the tenderloin steak are good, too. Wide range of wine selection that you can either take away or dine in with. Reservation is recommended.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108461173587635219388/reviews
Gasper Chan,4,"Had the cheese platter, clams and pasta. Food was not too bad for the price.

Good place to have a nice dinner, although tables are quite close to each other which means there is a lack of privacy when having dinner - you can easily hear the conversation from the next table.

Overall still a good place for dinner.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116187504655013802323/reviews
Gen P,5,Food was well-executed and came quickly. The salmon was cooked perfectly such that it was moist and not dry. The truffle mushroom pasta was also delicious. They went well with the wine. The apple crumble was nice as always. I was very impressed!,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109369774567397203689/reviews
E,5,"Excellent place for lunch or dinner, especially if you like wine with your food. Great service from the staff. Ordered the fish and chips. The fries were nicely salted,unlike a lot of places where they put so little salt and it's like eating plain fried potato. The fish batter was crispy and deep fried to a nice golden brown.

The apple crumble was 1 of the best I've ever eaten, the crumbs were so crunchy and you can tell everything is all handmade and not commercial type of food",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103665268796109855493/reviews
