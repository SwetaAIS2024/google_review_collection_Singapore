The CNY mini buffet set has 8 dishes, 1 dessert, packet drinks and cutlery was also provided. Favourite dishes are golden salted egg prawn and prawn paste chicken. It's our first time ordering from foodline and this vendor for CNY, overall it's a thumbs up for the whole ordering till delivery process.\n\n{Ordered from FoodLine.sg for 27 Jan 2025} foodline",
