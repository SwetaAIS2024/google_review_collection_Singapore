As with all Chinese skewers, the seasoning is pretty strong and if you‚Äôre here for dinner, you‚Äôd feel thirsty in the middle of the night. But nonetheless, it felt great eating this and pairing it with beer üçª\n\nMy recommendations are the chicken, mushrooms, French beans, pork belly!",

Almost everything is overcooked. Fungus salad $8 for about 10 pieces. Wondered how this shop survived until now. It's obviously a hit and run kinda restaurant. If anyone going to order or eat at this restaurant will be eating at your own risk. There is absolutely no standard at all. Utterly disappointed.",
