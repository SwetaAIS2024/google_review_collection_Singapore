Tracy Zhang,4,"My friends want to try their salmon üç£ so we chose this Thai restaurant.
Beef curry which has a very special name, it‚Äôs flavorful but the beef is too soft, it seems stewed for a long time. It‚Äôs a little bit sweet and not spicy at all.
The yellow curry with prawns is a small portion with 4 prawns üç§ but enough to share with 2-3, a little bit spicy but I think with rice will be better with noodles.
I didn‚Äôt try the salmon but they said it‚Äôs ok.
The papaya was not sour and spicy enough it‚Äôs mildly sweet.
Overall the food is ok.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115734578140137125670/reviews
Javier Tan,4,"FOOD
Great food, most of the dishes were fresh and high quality. Loved the dishes like the green curry and Omelette, of high standard.
Price point wasn‚Äôt the best, main reason why you would come here is probably because of the drinks. The portions were small yet cost was high. Dishes like kangkong and Tom Yum was a little disappointing and not spicy or tasty enough.

SERVICE
Friendly and efficient service, they even took the effort to clean the seats when we felt it wasn‚Äôt too clean.

ATMOSPHERE
Very nicely designed and not too cramped, with a comfortable exterior and interior.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106617631020704357051/reviews
