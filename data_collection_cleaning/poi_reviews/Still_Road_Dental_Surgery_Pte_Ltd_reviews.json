Notify Dr Lee and he just brush it off. Final session ended... I now have a crooked jaw line. Told Dr Lee and he say there is nothing he can do. He is the most irresponsible dentist I have ever encountered. If there is a negative star rating, I would definitely give -100.. üëéüëéüëé",

      "text": "Convinced me that extracting premolars were necessary for my braces so went ahead to do that. Went to another dentist few months after the extractions, and the first comment was ‚Äúwhy did you extract your premolars?‚Äù Apparently there was a way to do proceed with braces without extracting premolars and i was furious upon hearing that. Times have changed, there are definitely more skilful, updated dentists/orthodontists out there. Thank you Dr Lee for the irreversible procedure i will probably regret for many years to come",
