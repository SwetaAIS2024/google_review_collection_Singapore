Smitha K Punugu,5,I have used this service multiple times and for something as important as my husbandâ€™s 40th. It was the best thing I could have done as the entire process was smooth and professionally managed. The team went beyond my expectations and joined in to make sure the celebrations went as per planned. I would highly recommend the party bus and the company simply because they manage it all for you and let you focus on the important part which is creating memories. FYI - I have had 3 other friends book this service after our party.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103117584995336061574/reviews
