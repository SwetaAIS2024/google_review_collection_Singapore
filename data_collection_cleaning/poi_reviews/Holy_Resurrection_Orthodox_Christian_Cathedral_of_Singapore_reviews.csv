Scott Brightwell,5,"Lovely parish. To the other reviewer, all I can say is ""seek and you shall find.""  Holy Resurrection is in the education building of the Catholic facility there. Beware of a lack of parking on Sunday morning. Uber was easy.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106259597702027680588/reviews
Irvin Cheung,5,"I have had one of the most astounding and amazing understanding of the Eastern Orthodox worship by accidentally stumbling into this church! I was warmly welcomed and hosted by the parishioners and deacons even though I was just a curious Bible College student.
I would gladly visit them again and perhaps spend more time after their service to understand more about their ways of worshipping of God! Hallelujah!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116889286474236012479/reviews
Nikolay Ryabkov,5,"It's inside the catholic premises. Follow directions on the right side. Vending machine outside the ""cathedral"" makes it the most unusual orthodox church I've ever seen.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104052856650033771087/reviews
Nick Anargyros,1,"How  disappointing when there is no contact telephone number for people who have travelled from overseas and want to enquire about services etc. Not very welcoming......maybe you want it that way.
But that is not Christ's way.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110226430511060151578/reviews
