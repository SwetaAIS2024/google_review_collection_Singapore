Jason Lee,3,"Price a bit higher than mala bao bao but still alright. Taste is decent for medium spicy, not watered down like some stalls. There is ""ma"" taste to it but no Sichuan pepper in the bowl so probably use the powder type. My only gripe is the meat do not taste very fresh.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103026301809587742390/reviews

Tanya,1,"Chinese girl with bleached hair is extremely rude. Doesn't acknowledge you when you speak and responds rudely when you repeat yourself. She once shoved my mala pot and almost spilt it over. Talks back, and has a rude attitude 24/7. No manners or customer service whatsoever. Everyone who comes here with me doesnt like to deal with her. Food's good, slightly overpriced tho.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118215635271052205021/reviews
