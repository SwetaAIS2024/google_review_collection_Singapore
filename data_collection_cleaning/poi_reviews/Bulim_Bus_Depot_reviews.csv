Efsgt EcoArt,1,"Emailed to Australia HQ Transit Systems, I wish to complain your Singapore bus service poor quality recently. I will explain more when you have replied email. I suspect corruption in your Singapore office management! I'm a Singaporean, have complained to your Singapore office but useless. Since my complains, the service is getting real bad.👀🙏👎👎👎😕",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105629745617562316721/reviews
Nat Beam,1,"Bus 969 - SG6136R

Boarded the bus in the morning at tampines interchange. The bus was filled with cigarette smoke!!

Either your driver was smoking in the bus before he docked at the berth
Or he failed to ask an errant passenger to put out the cigarette

Very terrible experience",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113493595251332161843/reviews
Zhixiang Chee Siong,1,Started off reasonably well with prompt bus timing but has become just like the other main bus service providers. Bus timings have become erratic; with buses departing from bus interchange being late for almost 10 minutes. Thumbs down.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101494858664707763825/reviews
Ridhuan Sofian,1,"Rude bus driver. Open the bus back door at delfi for passenger to get down. Whereas the bus infront had went off. Wanted to take the bus number but he sped off.

Location: Delfi bus stop
Timing: 4.45pm
Bus number: 106

Please into it since there is a cctv in the bus. Also we tried not to be rude and waste other passengers time. Therefore kindly teach teach the bus driver. Its a vice versa things to be polite.

Shreesha Bhat,1,"Never know when the bus will come. Just now LTA app is showing 15mins for 106 bus, but surprisingly the bus is coming. This is not the first time. Daily it's a surprise for me on the way to office. Moreover the bus goes so slow, I feel I can run faster than the bus. Because of the slowness now a days am forced to start early to office. Very sad. Completely disappointed.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103232407710377514738/reviews
