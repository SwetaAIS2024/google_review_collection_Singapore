Not only did Sam gave us a personal guided tour of the watches on showcase (which we didn't expect), he was generous in sharing what he knows and patiently entertained all the questions that we had. Thank you Sam! :)\n\nWill recommend anyone keen to be acquainted more knowledge on luxury watches to pay a visit to FutureGrail, it's free after all!",
