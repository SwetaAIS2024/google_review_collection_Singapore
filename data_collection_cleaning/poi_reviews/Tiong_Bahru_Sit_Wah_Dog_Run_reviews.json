      "text": "Itâ€™s one of the most beautiful small natural forested parks in Singapore. It has awesome lush trees and their foliage is simply gorgeous, itâ€™s incredible. You can see blue kingfishers here and other exotic birds. Its a good place to practice the art of shinrin yoku , waldbaden. I have two suggestions: flowers can be grown on the fence line to beautify the park more. And, to help ameliorate the muddy conditions during the wet season, french drains can be dug into the ground to assist with drainage.",
