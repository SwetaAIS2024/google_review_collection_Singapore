Gabriel Seah,5,Fish porridge was smooth yet not blended into oblivion (I prefer it this way). It was really tasty. There was a good amount of ginger & the fish was quite fresh.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107859662951742168090/reviews
Carrie Tan,5,"My parents have been eating this since 30+ years ago and they’ve brought me here to eat since I was young. Same great taste as ever, this has to be my favourite porridge spot in SG. Clean tasting but flavourful, not jelat at all. The pork balls are very very very very very nice!!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116401423554610611506/reviews
