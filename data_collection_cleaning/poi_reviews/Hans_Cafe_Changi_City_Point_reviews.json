      "text": "Nice Singapore style Tea and Breakfast.\n\nI like fried Egg and Spanish style Tomato üçÖ Omelette, Juicy and delicious.\n\nIt's open at 7am and very helpful for who comes to CBP early.\n\nService is excellent. I must give seven star rating for the staff here. Very patient, polite and hard working.\n\nUsually Indians drink Tea or Coffee in less volume and this share the Tea like one by two and two by three.\n\nStaff pretty much understand this requirement and share the Tea or Coffee accordingly and prepare so nicely.\n\nI suggest to have tray  return area so that it will help to optimise seating and timing during lunch time and save time for staff as well.",

Very much like any order = Bothering them.\n\nHowever, this is not their business but their company instead. They still get paid for their slack of service which directly impact the co. Business of Han‚Äôs Cafe.\n\nWill recommend to spend your money at other outlet instead for much better service & food quality standard.",
