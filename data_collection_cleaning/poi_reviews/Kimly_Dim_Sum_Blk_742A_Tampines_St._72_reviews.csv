Nichole Yee,1,Kimly almost all outlet have this issue. This is not the first time. Order barley or chrysanthemum tea the ice the half of the cup and you hardly can enjoy the drink for $2.50. Nowadays ‘robbing’ patrons money is so easy.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108428121303220983605/reviews
shanna koh,1,"Dimsum was great! and service was good, what i want to talk about is the drink stall aunty! she was wearing the kimly shirt so here i am.

I stood there for about 3mins waiting for her to take my order, she couldnt be bothered to ask me, so i told her my order. (one ice lemon tea, one ice milo, drink here) she came towards me and asked me to repeat. i said the same thing. she asked me “ice milo big or small” i said small. she proceeded to say “weird, how come udk how to say it all in one line: ice milo small, make me ask again”

it immediately ruined my mood. she then asked me again if drink here or take away. I HELD IT IN and chose to be nice.

this is not the first time either. when my bf wanted to get ice milo, he said “milo” so she made hot milo. then he asked if he could change it to ice milo, she said “sorry i alrd made it you never say just now right? so you get hot milo” i dont think its thats hard to pour the drink into a cup of ice… or at least reject nicely….

PLEASE if shes so unhappy to work then dont work. pretty sure the other reviews are about her too. pls do smth abt this, management!!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113894407192736368355/reviews
JH Lee,1,"The dim sum aunty has a really bad attitude. Early in the morning, we have to deal with her unpleasant expression, as if we owe her money or have wronged her entire family. Will definitely avoid this shop in the future",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106734622638796351916/reviews
thu tran,1,I ordered grab. And they gave me the wrong food. They said grab took the food themselves and couldn't call grab. Why did they let grab take the wrong food??? Was it intentional? And they blamed grab. Grab blamed the restaurant. In the end I didn't get to eat my dinner.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110943852803882280589/reviews
Ming L,1,"I visited Kimly Dim Sum this morning and was very disappointed with the service. I bought two of their bak kwa bao, and the aunty at the counter made an unnecessary and rude comment to my child, saying, “Your dad is so niao (stingy), buying 2 instead of 5.” Excuse me, aunty, why would I buy more if I can’t finish them? Such remarks are uncalled for.

Her attitude was really poor. I also overheard her telling another customer, who asked for more chili, that he had already taken a lot earlier. It’s frustrating to deal with this kind of rude behavior, especially when we’re just trying to enjoy our meal.

If she continues working with this lousy attitude and making aimless remarks, I doubt anyone will want to patronize your stall again, including me and my family. Kimly, please train your staff to treat customers with respect!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115836132536140816090/reviews
