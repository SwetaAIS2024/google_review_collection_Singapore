Edwin Petrus,4,"Bendemeer Shopping Mall is just a straight covered pedestrian mall between Block 25 and Block 27. It is located just next to Boon Keng MRT Station. It is non air conditioned shopping alley. It offers choices of products for shoppers like fruit, pastry, saloon, chinese herbs, banking, pawnshop. It is also next to Bendemeer Market. It is a convenient place to shop for daily needs. It was crowded during lunch time.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114785935323023325370/reviews
Nissiel Yu,3,"It‚Äôs a hustling and bustling shopping center especially over lunch and dinner! So watch out for that!
Their food is hit or miss! For me it‚Äôs always a hit if you know what you like and you‚Äôre not a food snob you will find comfort food here!
Groceries and errands can all be done here
Value dolllar bubble teas nails hair bakeries phone fixers etc
And considerably more affordable then if you went to an actually Mall/ city (despite boon Jeng being so close to the city)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100087945417652081498/reviews
