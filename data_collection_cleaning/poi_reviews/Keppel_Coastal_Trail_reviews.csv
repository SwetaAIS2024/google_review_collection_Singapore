JuzChris L.,2,"Extension to Labrador Park & Nature Reserves. A short 90m-long elevated boardwalk along the coastal walk. Newly planted trees and shrubs could be seen along the trail in effort to revive the native coastal species that increase sources of food and places for animals to seek shelter.
Better nature hiking trails are at the Labrador Nature Reserve.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100442615697378152802/reviews
Damcho Tshering,5,"Today, I ventured along the Keppel Coastal Trail at Labrador Park, and it was an unforgettable experience! This scenic trail meanders along the coastline, offering breathtaking views of the sea, lush greenery, and a refreshing sea breeze.

Walking along the boardwalk, surrounded by mangroves and rocky shores, I felt completely immersed in nature. The trail beautifully combines coastal serenity with rich biodiversity, making it a perfect escape from the city‚Äôs hustle and bustle.

If you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful walk with stunning coastal views, the Keppel Coastal Trail is a must-visit!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833702802756994837/reviews
Edeline Tan,2,"Disappointed with the new additions. We live nearby and come to Labrador Park and do the walk to Harbourfront regularly, and we were excited when we heard about the ""boardwalk"", hoping it would link Labrador park to Pasir Panjang via the wild  rocky coastline (see photo). Instead, they just built a short, raised walkway at the centre of the park itself and joined it to the existing network of paths Labrador has always had. After all those months of construction, this is all they could do?
The nearby walk along the coast from Harbourfront Ave to the Labrador Park Jetty is beautiful and well worth doing especially since the reopening of the Bukit Chermin Boardwalk a year back. But the recent ""opening"" of the Keppel Coastal Trail is something of a misnomer if the only enhancement is this underwhelming short, elevated walkway.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105348966795083851800/reviews
Boon Leong,4,"The coastal trail with whole lebrador park is good place to relax & exercise minus the view of the nearby portü§£
Place is clean & well maintained
From the trail to the nearby marina where you get to yachts üõ•Ô∏è is a good break from the bustling office",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118439101019407877742/reviews
Yvonne Lee,4,"A short but breezy seaside stretch. Lots of diverse ethnobotanical mangrove species to appreciate, such as mentigi, jambu kera, and mengkudu laut. Was introduced to the term ‚Äúswale‚Äù and its clever purpose of assisting with drainage through one of the informational signboards, although it would be cool to include a simple conceptual explanation/diagram of how swales worked and the design process.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112131738209053568347/reviews
