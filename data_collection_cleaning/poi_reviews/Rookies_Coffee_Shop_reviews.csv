Caleb Cheah,5,"one of the best coffees in town!

the iced white ($6.50) was silky and rich, and i could taste the nuttiness through the milk, which made it very delectable for me!

baristas were knowledgeable and friendly, and their recommendations were spot on :)

place could be slightly noisier at times and is rather small, so it‚Äôs more like a grab and go coffee store. would love to try the filters next time üòãü§§",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113550379597608370516/reviews
Teresa Tan,5,"Located in the heartland of Bukit Merah, this cafe offers a cozy atmosphere for visitors. The service is efficient, with a knowledgeable barista ready to assist. A highlight is the cafe latte, which is noted for its creamy texture and delicious flavor. Even those who are not typically coffee enthusiasts may appreciate the lack of bitterness in the coffee, making it a pleasant surprise for many.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104946335434193065173/reviews
Danial Muhd Tan,5,"Was in the area and saw Rookie's, decided to get my fix of caffeine and got the ‚ÄúWhoop Whoop‚Äù (espresso and a piccolo). Didn‚Äôt expect too much but the coffee was actually really solid. Smooth, strong, and really really enjoyable. Overheard the guys talking to other customers about coffee and can really tell they're knowledgeable of their craft.  Place has a chill vibe, not too crowded on a Tuesday afternoon. This joint is worth checking out.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100023599169466741248/reviews
Tan Li Ling,5,"One of the best coffees I've had. YOU CANNOT TRY if you dislike a creamy and smooth white. Might be too milky for some to like but works perfectly for me. The distinct notes elevated the whole experience (Is there tangerine ??)

Very unassuming place, glad I made a trip specially for this coffee. Totally no regrets!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111364657862336976539/reviews
Veronica Ong,5,"These guys roast their own beans, and it shows ‚Äî every cup is a little love letter to coffee. The owner, Junior, is an absolute legend! You can tell he‚Äôs completely mad (in the best way) about coffee and genuinely cares about giving you a great experience. The kind of person who‚Äôll make you a brew and a believer.

Highly recommend trying their single origin ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a flavour burst for your tastebuds. And if you‚Äôre feeling a bit cheeky, go for the latte with coffee jelly. Sounds odd, tastes brilliant. Honestly, I‚Äôd come back just for that wobbly little surprise in a cup.

If you‚Äôre anywhere nearby, pop in. If you‚Äôre not, travel there anyway ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth the pilgrimage!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105006880730838150071/reviews
