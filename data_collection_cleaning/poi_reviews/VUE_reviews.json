Highly recommend the oysters, mushroom risotto and lamb rack üòã Special mention to the Smoke and Whisper cocktail - I loved the smoky and deep flavours of it\n\nIt was our first time, but Mikk was very welcoming and was eager to provide us with recommendations. He constantly checked in with us, making us feel comfortable throughout the meal.\n\nThe food was a highlight, but the immaculate service and lovely atmosphere was what made our experience there so memorable. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back here!",

Chef Jin Wei warmly shared his inspiration behind the dish and is proficient in his craft. We had a great time. Coupled with the enchanting view the restaurant has to offer, Vue has become one of our favourite places to dine at! Thank you for having us!",
