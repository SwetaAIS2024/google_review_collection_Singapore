K,5,"What's great?
Prawns are big and fresh and cheap!!! OMG!
Service is great and fast. Boss is so nice and greets you! Prawn paste is delicious. Fish is chunky and nice. Fish ball with roe is good. Marinated meat is good. Environment is windy, clean and comfortable.

What's to improve?
Very thirsty for whole night.

Visit again?
Yes, but would probably skipped those with more salt/ msg.

*HOKKIEN MEE seems to have stopped*
This stall primary business is mookata. At the side, there is a small opening where you can order Hokkien mee (4.50/ 6.50). First time ordering this, and what's a surprise. Well cooked Hokkien prawn mee with 2 of the largest and freshest prawns I ever got for my Hokkien mee anywhere in Singapore. Generous with their chilli, this is a must add.

Would try their mookata next.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109386738253826668143/reviews

Victor,5,"Portions were decent and the ingredients were fresh. We ordered a variety of different food, from pork belly to bacon and also mushrooms and other vegetables.
Prawn paste was really good.

Soup a bit salty though, we were very thirsty after the meal.
Courteous and friendly staff enhanced our dining experience.

We spent $30 for two people.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117236758220742584078/reviews
James L,5,"Visited this mookata shop for a few years since covid until now. Food here is tasty and fresh. I love their pork belly and fish the most. Their pricing is relatively affordable too!

The boss always greet us with a big smile and ensure that we are well taken care of during the meal.

I‚Äôd recommend people to travel here just to try it out.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100784429729354288375/reviews
ting -,5,"Visited the stall N times and it‚Äôs always a very delightful experience from start to finish. The stall offers a fantastic array of fresh ingredients that made our meal truly memorable. Prawn paste is a must order and the soup is full of umami! Not forgetting how reasonable the price is too!

What stood out the most was the service by the boss himself. He would greet you with a genuine smile, hold small talks with their customers and tries to remember your name so that he can greet you by your name the next time you visit. It‚Äôs so rare to find such personal connection in a dining establishment.

If you're looking for not only delicious mookata but also a dining experience with a personal touch, Mookata Eating House is the perfect choice. A big shoutout to the boss for making our visit memorable, and we can't wait to be back for another round of delightful flavors and warm hospitality!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117584227304818194390/reviews
