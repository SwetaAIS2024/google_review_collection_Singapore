      "text": "I’ve only been going for guitar lessons there for 2 months but I can already see such an improvement. His approach to learning and teaching us is making us the musician, not the learner which is the best way to do it. In schools they teach you to make you the student but it’s not as good and fun as it is with Mr Rajiv. I’ve been getting cello lessons at my school for almost 7 years, and the way she teaches me is so different and not as helpful as the way Mr Rajiv teaches. The atmosphere of it is so calming and feels like you are in a music studio (you basically are). He also teaches you how to record music and make your own songs, if you’re into that sort of stuff. It’s right next to the bus stop which is very convenient for most learners. I highly recommend coming here if you want to learn an instrument or song write. Thank you so much Mr Rajiv!!",

I wasn’t sure if it was just going to be another short-lived interest that would slowly die off but Jiv really inspires and makes learning the drums fun.",
