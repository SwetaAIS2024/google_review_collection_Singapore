Kris Tan,5,The prawn noodles here 7/10 as graded by my husband. I tried the pork ribs and they gave big ribs and big portion of noodles. Soup was flavourful and thick. The soup was the winning combo.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113045172442983765686/reviews

Hatsune Miku,4,"Fengshan Hawker Centre is one my favourite hawker centres in the east. The variety of food here is amazing, and some of these stalls open till late night, making this a very viable supper place. One of the more notable mentions here is probably Chai Chee Pork Porridge which serves really good pork balls in their porridge. Strongly recommend anyone who has not patronise this place to come at least once.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109198790780321411397/reviews
Martin Yeo,5,"This is THE place for suckers of local Singapore hawkers' food. Such a wide and varied variety of local food, spread across 7-8 rows of stalls, with many hawkers selling similar local food. So you will be spoilt for choices of both your favourite hawkers and favourite food.
The is a rare find in Singapore, with most hawkers stalls closing on Mondays as the hawkers sort to rest their tired bodies after all the hectic weekends of whipping up their local delights. As this place houses a wide varieties of local food and hawkers, you can most certainly find a stall serving your favourite food open for business, and this place never disappoints every Monday. Best to come in the evening, as this place comes alive when the sun goes down.
Again, the place is rather unique, in the sense of food ordering. You basically approach the food stall of your choice, order the food that you want from their menu, pay up front for your choice, and collect a buzzer device which you can then proceed back to your table to wait, or proceed to order another dish or food from another stall. When your food is ready, the buzzer sounds, and you return to the stall to collect your food.
In this way, you or your family, or your group of friends, can have a choice of individually prefer food, or share some common dishes, or have a combination of individual or shared food. Builds friendship and family bonding when food is shared together.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107217464996017596553/reviews
