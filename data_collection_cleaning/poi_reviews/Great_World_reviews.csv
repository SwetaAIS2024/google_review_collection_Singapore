Flo Yeow,5,"This MRT station boasts an impressive network of underground walkways, providing convenient access throughout the River Valley area, including Great World City.

The station's modern design and feel, extending from the control rooms to the exits and bus stops, are particularly noteworthy.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews

Wee Gim Hong (Nbss),5,"This is one of my favorite stations to go to because I really loved the design they made for the interior of the MRT station! Quite convenient to go to Great World City and a nearby school from here. Unfortunately, some exits that are easily assessable to Great World City is still under renovation! I am fine with that‚Ä¶ Also this places is near Orchard but ironically it is far from Orchard. Before this station was opened, we have to get here by bus by far the best. I feel good that they opened this MRT station!!ü§™üòÅ Quite nearby some condominiums found in the vicinity!üòÉ",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105439552809381147212/reviews
Luke,5,"Train stations is quite nice and the design is attractive. There is a Cheers and an ijooz station where they serve orange juice. An exit to Great World has since opened for a while, but they are currently building an exit to a overhead bridge that enters great world shopping mall.
It is nearly complete at the time of posting. Could have opened an exit closer to the nearby River Valley Primary School. Otherwise very good. Also after school (1.30pm) please expect Cheers to be crowded with schoolchildren.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110051069223982775552/reviews
