      "text": "Such a wonderful zi char experience such that we went back the following day to try out the other menus. Assam fish at $28 was amazing, salted egg prawn is de-shelled, signature pork ribs is fantastic and it actually comes with bones, sweet potato leaves, nai bai veg were alright and not soaked in oil. 2nd day dinner minced meat tofu was great, tofu self made soft and crisp outer layer, broccoli well fried, baby squid sotong nothing to fault, 排骨王 was standard taste, 虾枣 is handmade but no prawn meat found. Will return to try out the fried rice/noodles/小炒 next. Price wise standard for a neighbourhood zi char, ample parking lots and it situated right beside eunos MRT station.",

      "text": "Ee mian have the wok hey taste, pork lard toppings was also cripsy(mostly soft at other tze char)l stores)which brings out the flavour.\nFried rice was bad, can tell by the look of it. Rice is hard and tasteless (no wok hey) at all. Ordered salted fish with chicken fried rice, it feels like they just fried the rice and dump the salted fish on it as the rice itself doesnt even have salted fish taste too.\nStaff wasnt that friendly when i ask for the rice/noodle menu, just somehow threw the 1 page laminate menu towards me when knowing im not ordering from the \"main book ala carte\" menu.",

Usually really packed during weekends and peak hours.\nVery generous portions. Affordable prices.\nTasted good too!\nThe pork ribs were boneless.\nSpinach soup was bigger than expected. Came with glass noodles.",
