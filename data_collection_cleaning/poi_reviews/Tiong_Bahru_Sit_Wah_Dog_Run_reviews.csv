Jimmy Ong,5,"We rarely come here, but happy to leave because there are ants on ground. Keep running, and bring your own repellent ðŸ˜¿ðŸ˜¹",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106751664242252877513/reviews
Yau Ming,5,"Itâ€™s one of the most beautiful small natural forested parks in Singapore. It has awesome lush trees and their foliage is simply gorgeous, itâ€™s incredible. You can see blue kingfishers here and other exotic birds. Its a good place to practice the art of shinrin yoku , waldbaden. I have two suggestions: flowers can be grown on the fence line to beautify the park more. And, to help ameliorate the muddy conditions during the wet season, french drains can be dug into the ground to assist with drainage.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110738597911237958015/reviews

Kendra Wong,1,"Checked it out since I was in the vicinity. Nothing much here, the forested area was fenced up, no proper footpath to walk on, no scenery/view to shout about. In fact, it was the back alley of some shops, and there were a few rubbish chutes around.

Would not recommend this place",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115971234197012484927/reviews
Nicky Arms,4,"Great place to take your dog. Other dogs and owners really nice, my dog had a blast running and playing. It's very shady so you don't need to worry about the heat. The only thing to improve would be a water fountain, we used all our water really quickly.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115975156209364274177/reviews
