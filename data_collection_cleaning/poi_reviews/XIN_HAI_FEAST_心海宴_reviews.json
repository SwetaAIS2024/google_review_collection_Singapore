      "text": "The taste of the food is acceptable. However, it is extremely pricey for a restaurant like this in a neighbourhood environment.\n\nVeggie itself costs $15.90 for such a small portion, and it doesn't look like what the picture shows. I attached the menu photo and what we got for both the HK Kailan Ginger Prawn Paste, it shows to have some fried seaweed on it and some floss, but all we got is just fried shallots. For the Prawn Paste Chicken Wing, it shows to have some sauce on the menu, but it's just the usual fried chicken wing. Taste wise is good, but just disappointed at the misleading photos.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't come back again. For the price we are paying (we spent 70++ for 5 pax), I could go to a better restaurant with a better atmosphere, and enjoy the food even more.",

They also give a generous amount of garlic crumbs!\n\nSteamed Crab: Very fresh, can taste the natural sweetness.\n\nSpinach with Trio Egg: The broth was rich and flavourful, and I love the texture from the century egg and salted egg.",

      "text": "â€œCanâ€™t believe we found a live seafood stall with full-on restaurant quality in the neighborhood! The plates and bowls are even chinaware instead of plastic.\nEach type of live seafood has a different living environment, each tank has its own specific temperature, oxygen level, and salinity to keep everything just right. And the prices? Super reasonable for the quality youâ€™re getting.\n\nThe staff were lovely â€” so friendly and even checked if we liked the food. They noticed we didnâ€™t finish the kailan and asked about it (we had just done some dental work and couldnâ€™t chew it ðŸ˜…).\n\nWe were honestly too blown away by the seafood to take photos, just got one of the oysters. But the soon hok was also amazing. Highly recommend checking this place out!",
