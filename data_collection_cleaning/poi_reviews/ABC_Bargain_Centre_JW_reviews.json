      "text": "There is one man who works at the store (the rest are women) who spends his time doing crossword puzzles instead of working. Meanwhile, the women are usually busy working hard. This man had the audacity to tell me not to knock things over, even though I wasn't touching anything. He was also blocking the aisle and still had the nerve to tell me to stop hitting things. The store has very narrow aisles by design, and on top of that, this worker was acting like he was in charge.\n\nI recommend that store management address his behavior",

      "text": "Very rude staff at ABC taman jurong. Especially one short hair pinoy old lady who was packing at detergent corner of shop abt 11.30 of 6 jan 2025. As the corner was crowded wt stock n blocked by the 2 staff , i accidentally brushed off a pack of blu toilet thing off the rack and wanted to pick up saying “oops drop alrdy” .  Old lady n another pinoy staff then proceeded to say yah drop off cos u spoil it . I think it is not right to start accusing customers immed as we are not even sure if packaging was already damaged before i walk past the rack . Will be glad to provide more details n photo of rude staff involved if mgt would like more details . Will be writing in to Main office too . When i was queuing up to make payment , the cashier staff n old lady were all talking loudly across the shop sarcastically abt me in both malay n filipino ..  is this the way ABC shop allows ur foreign staff to run your shop  ?",

While she manage to squeeze tightly all my purchases into the eventual bloated mid-size plastic bag, there was no way I could put my own stuff in without easily dropping out. Being a Valudollar regular, I know their bigger bag could be reuse as a trash bag which the mid-size one would be too small to fit into my home bin and ended up being truly a one time usage, something I guessed that smart Alec staff would find it hard to imagine.",
