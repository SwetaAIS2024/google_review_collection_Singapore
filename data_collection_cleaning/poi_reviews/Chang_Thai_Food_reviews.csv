VT,5,"Having just came back from Bangkok. I think it‚Äôs safe to say my rating for this eatery is definitely higher than its current level.

The fried egg, stir fried kangkong, Tom yum soup and Pad Kra Pow are all very tasty and close to what you can get from Thailand itself.

So do give them your support and be objective la, when reviewing hawker stalls.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115143786523664384667/reviews
Linda Ong,5,"We really enjoying this Thai food, and the value for money is impressive. The fact that it tastes like restaurant-standard food at a lower price point is a definite win.

Han Sin Chia,5,"They open for lunch n dinner.
So far tried their rice vermicelli, pineapple rice n green curry.

Their rice vermicelli is my favorite. Their pineapple rice is good too, full of flavor unlike many other places where they taste more like normal rice. Their green curry is good too, thick n milky",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100597066225087321607/reviews
Karen,1,"Green curry was all curry and have like very very very little amount of chicken (looks like maybe 1 gram or 2 grams of it in total), literally can‚Äôt really see any chicken at all. It‚Äôs rather pathetic.

The prawn omelette has ONE small shrimp that is cut into 15 pieces and spread across the egg, and it‚Äôs called prawn omelette.

Definitely not coming back, feels like a rip off in terms of their scrimping of ingredients.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104105746129161216120/reviews
