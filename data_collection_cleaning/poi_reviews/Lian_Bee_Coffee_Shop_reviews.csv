Kenny Eng,5,"One of the best fishball minced pork noodles is hidden in this coffee shop. Have been eating there for 6 years and they operate there for almost 15 years.

What so special is their chilli which is their own recipe. Freshly make every day for the soup and the ingredients. Very old school type of food.

Because of their popularity now, their shop closed very early like before 12pm. Their actual operating hours are 6 am to 2 pm. Highly recommended!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114251813794295819278/reviews
CK Tan,5,"Ya Halimm Malay Food Store. My colleague rated the Lontong dish 9/10. I agreed. Nested away from most food establishments is this unassuming little Malay food stall run by 2 cheerful ladies, serving dishes that are comparable to those at Haja Maimmunah but of lesser variety.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102797007706981476316/reviews
WT,3,"This is more like a food court, many vendors join together at this corner.
There were Vietnamese food, Halal, and Singaporean food.
I only tried the Banhmi, which was ok.  Reasonable price, and she was nice. But it’s all self serve.
Outdoor seating with many fans so it wasn’t that hot. But with many smokers, so if you are like me as a non smoker you’ll find that annoying.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116449724027779879036/reviews

Mark Tan,4,"For a tiny coffee shop, it houses 3 popular stalls, the bak chor/fishball noodles, malay food (mee rebus, mee siam) and authentic Vietnamese cuisine. The latter is being operated by Vietnamese. They are all worth a try.

Unfortunately, some of the stalls are moving elsewhere soon because of the higher rent.

There are very limited parking space by the road but one can park at the residential carpark nearby.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111684394902487136193/reviews
