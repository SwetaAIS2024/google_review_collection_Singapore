Eva Wong,2,"If you can't make it for one facial, they will deduct it without any excuses accepted, not even when you happened to have scars on your face or working late. What is the point of putting so much stress on your customer when they are the one paying for your services and intending to relax when they buy the facial. Highly not recommended.",12 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100445136995584069455/reviews
