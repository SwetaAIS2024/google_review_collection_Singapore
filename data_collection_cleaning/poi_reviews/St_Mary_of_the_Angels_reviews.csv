Benedict Correya,5,"St. Mary of the Angels in Bukit Batok is a strikingly beautiful and spiritually uplifting church. Its modern architecture and large windows allow natural light to fill the space, creating a serene and peaceful atmosphere. The moment I entered, I felt welcomed by the warm and friendly community.

Attending a service there was a deeply moving experience—conducted with solemnity and grace, it left a lasting impression. The church is more than a place of worship; it's a vibrant hub for religious, social, and charitable activities, reflecting its strong commitment to community service.

Nestled amidst lush greenery, the church offers a quiet space for reflection. Whether you’re a Catholic or someone seeking spiritual inspiration, St. Mary of the Angels is a must-visit for its architecture, atmosphere, and welcoming spirit.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292377967743781974/reviews
1106 tydkcr,5,"St Mary of the Angels church, very modern design church, wooden and glass type. Very artistic rugged type of crucifix from the ceiling. Well, It represents Jesus during his suffering towards the Crucifixion.

Church is open to pray before and after mass which is good and not get chased away. Peaceful and cooling just sitting in the church itself. Walking through the niches in columbarium give you peace, not scary like others in basement behind door.

Nearby there are neighborhood shops, markets, coffeeshops and ntuc, giant.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116686755872994624252/reviews
Yellow Bear,4,"A beautiful and peaceful Catholic Church near the Bukit Batok Nature Park. Definitely worth a visit, even if you are not a Catholic. I felt welcomed by the Catholics there, who simply greeted me with warm smiles and just left me to myself.
The Franciscan Columbarium is also worth a visit. It is bright, clean and peaceful, unlike others which are dim, gloomy and eerie.
Thanks, I felt so blessed to be here, even though I’m a nonbeliever.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
Elaine Caballero,5,"This church is a 25-minute bus ride from Jurong Library. This church is structured quite differently from other Catholic Churches I’ve been to. The one that would mostly catch 1st-time visitors is the hanging sculpture of the Christ. Aside from that, they have soundproof rooms for families with infants. They also have dedicated spaces for persons in wheelchairs. They have church community programs and are very welcoming. During my temporary stay in Singapore, I’d been coming to this church rather than trying out elsewhere.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108602107259656660238/reviews
