Ramesh M,3,"A year ago, there was only one common toilet, bathroom for the whole floor which had up to 28-30 rooms.... But now they have built them both inside every room...
The things here in the supermarkets are a bit costly when compared to other places...
Management and security people are behaving rudely most of the times...
Most of the sightseeing places/time spending common places/most urbanized areas are far from here...
Even though the bus availability is at a decent intervals, It will remain crowded or it will be fully occupied from the bus stop here.(By workers from this dormitory)...
Alcohol consumption permitted areas available... Food courts are also available...
Overall, an average dormitory.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111788552769776561529/reviews
