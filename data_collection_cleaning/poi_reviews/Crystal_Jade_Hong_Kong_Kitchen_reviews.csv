We have had a satisfying meal and positive dining experience here!

Our order included:
â–ªï¸Ž1 Crispy White Bait with Salt & Pepper
â–ªï¸Ž1 Deep-fried Mango Roll Prawn (3pcs)
â–ªï¸Ž1 Pan-fried Pork Dumpling Guo Tie (3pcs)
â–ªï¸Ž1 Crisp-fried Crystal Prawn with Salted Egg Yoke

â–ªï¸Ž1 Golden Kumquat with Lime (Hot)
â–ªï¸Ž2 Hong Kong Milk Tea (Iced)
â–ªï¸Ž1 Red Bean Soup with 30 Years Orange Peel & Mini Glutinous Rice Ball

Thoroughly enjoyed the dishes we ordered. Fresh, well-cooked, served piping hot and deliciously flavorful! Notably, the fried dishes were crispyliciousðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ The super crisp and crunchy exterior, flavorful and succulent interior were to our liking; thankfully no greasiness or overused oil smell & taste. The scrumptious white bait and well-balanced, savory pork dumpling guo tie (yay, no gamey pork!) were our top favorites!

The delightfully fabulous red bean soup was a sweet note that completed our meal. The chewy mini balls without (the usual peanut, sesame or red bean) filling complemented the light orange peel flavored soup well. It had the right fragrance, consistency and sweetness. Absolutely no conflict or overpowering of flavor/taste in each ingredient; very close to what we had tried in Hong Kong! Terrific service too - service staff were welcoming, attentive and prompt.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109562020139406369328/reviews
Isaac Sam,4,"This outlet is decent, offering a variety of classic dishes. The dim sum and roasted meats are tasty, but not particularly memorable. Service can be slow during peak hours, but the ambience is comfortable and clean. Overall, itâ€™s an okay spot if youâ€™re craving some familiar Hong Kong flavours catered to local tastes.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108426703400532001032/reviews
E L,1,The most dry and most tough Peking duck meat I have eaten. It was so dry that I had to spit it out. We left the rest of the inedible duck meat uneaten. The crepe skin was also as dry as a cardboard. Standards have definitely dropped! The only saving grace was the dim sum like the mango prawn and the salted egg custard bun. Such a disappointment!,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110214031963532751816/reviews
CS* Chia,5,"I had the pleasure of dining at Crystal Jade Dim Sum Restaurant with my family, including the kids, and we had a fantastic experience!

The food quality was outstanding, and I was pleasantly surprised by how reasonable the prices were for the generous portions we received. Each dish was thoughtfully prepared, showcasing the restaurant's commitment to authenticity and flavor.

We particularly enjoyed the **custard buns**, which were a delightful treatâ€”sweet and perfectly steamed. The **porridge** was comforting and rich, making it a hit with both the kids and adults. The **dumplings** were another highlight; they were delightfully chewy and each packed with a generous prawn, ensuring every bite was satisfying.

The **fried rice** was exceptional, boasting that coveted ""wok hei"" flavor that truly elevated the dish.

Service was attentive and friendly, making our dining experience even more enjoyable. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, perfect for a family outing. The kids were well accommodated, and the staff was patient and engaging, which made the experience even more enjoyable for everyone.

In addition to the dishes we tried, I noticed a variety of other options on the menu that looked equally enticing. I canâ€™t wait to return and explore more of their offerings.

Overall, Crystal Jade Dim Sum Restaurant is a fantastic spot for families looking to enjoy delicious dim sum. I highly recommend it! Whether you're a dim sum enthusiast or trying it for the first time, this restaurant is sure to impress.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108623615709050081392/reviews
Skye Cai,5,"Great experience of their porridge style hotpot.
The soup base is clear, like the rice water, so it really depends on the freshness of the ingredients.
The prawns are jumbo and huge. Very fresh and sweet.
Beef slices as add on are thin slices, traditional US beef slices.
Vegetables are very fresh.
Portioning is great for two persons, good enough for sharing.
Scallops are the frozen type.
Tofu and beancurd skins donâ€™t have strong taste as the soup base is clear.
Staff are very friendly, provided very good services during the whole dining experiences.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
