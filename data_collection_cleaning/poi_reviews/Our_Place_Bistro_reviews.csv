Ryan SH Son,5,"This place truly deserves a glowing review. Nestled within the condo complex, it offers delicious food, warm hospitality every single day with only one day off a week, and a constant presence that makes it a go-to spot whenever you don’t feel like cooking at home. The name “Our Place” couldn’t be more fitting—it’s where friends can gather in shorts and slippers, enjoy a cold draft beer in total comfort, and feel completely at home. It’s simply a restaurant you can’t help but love.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104401246233768538569/reviews
Jacob Lee,3,"The service and atmosphere are quite nice. Overall, the staff are very cheerful and are willing to help you. However, the food quality can be improved. Sometimes, the food can be a bit too salty. If you want a dish with less salt, you have to tell the waiter to ask the chef to put less salt in your food.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104545290524873128606/reviews
CWWSIM,3,"Breakfast at $6 with free coffee or tea.

Nasi lemak was the best of the 3 mains we ordered. Laksa doesn't taste like local laksa, more towards thai laksa taste. Roti prata was meh... Straight out of a frozen packet and was oily though the curry had quite a bit of kick to it.

Lunch and dinner options were better with a mix of local zhi char dishes and western food offered from their menu.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114353151014603210098/reviews

Darren K,1,"I wish the food is much better. For the food quality,  it is worse than cooking at home.

Fish is not fresh and tastes like it had been in the freezer for months.

Chicken chop was okay only but I rather eat elsewhere.

Cafe ambience is nice and decent but really wish they can improve the food quality.

Service is not bad. The staff are friendly and helpful.

Just need a change in menu and chefs before they close down!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110239023595520540807/reviews
