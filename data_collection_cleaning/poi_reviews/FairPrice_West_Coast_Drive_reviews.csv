Louis Chua,2,"Small outlet. Nothing much to rave about. Do not have full range for most categories. Out of stocks for some skus are normal. Price is just so so. Customer service is alright. And oh yes, the dumb checkout machine is a pain. It doesnâ€™t really speed up anything just help NTUC to save costs and create unemployment. Also full of clutter at the entrance of the store.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117782437474545961841/reviews
