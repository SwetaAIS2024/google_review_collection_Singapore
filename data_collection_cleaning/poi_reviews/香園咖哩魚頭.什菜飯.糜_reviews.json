      "text": "Good variety of dishes that are decent tasting. But the lady seller can be grumpy and unpleasant at times.\n\nHer shop has the CDC voucher sign displayed. When I asked to pay by CDC voucher she screamed at me saying in the morning she\nis always busy cooking and has no time for this payment mode and why didn’t I ask her beforehand?\n\nI told her it was not a problem I would go get cash from my car and return in 5 mins. She answered “Who knows if you will return”?\n\nI also heard her scolding the customer before me who requested for bee hoon - “can’t you see we are selling rice”?\n\nOn another occasion someone commented that her squid was expensive and she flew into a rage.\n\nSo just buy your food, talk less and leave. 😜",
