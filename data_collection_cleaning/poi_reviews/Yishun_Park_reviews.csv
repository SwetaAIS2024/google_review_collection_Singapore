C005_00,5,A beautiful park where wild chickens roam freely. It’s a bit sad to see trees being cut down today. I really hope the government preserves this park—it’s a joy to watch the chickens and listen to their crowing everyday.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113184718930112281050/reviews
