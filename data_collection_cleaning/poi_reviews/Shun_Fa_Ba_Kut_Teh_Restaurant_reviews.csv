Sze Yih Cheo,5,"actually I donâ€™t put high expectation but it came out quite good for me. Is not like Klang BkT those very dark soup, but it still has its herbs taste. I personally likes their salted vege. Seldom BKT place with aircond. Good that we can eat even is a hot sunny day .",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100673948222505052276/reviews
Jon Lee,5,"Good alternative for my wife and I as we use to go to Soon Huat BKT at Taman Sentosa [on the same row as Ah Koong Fishball noodle in JB]
Soup was good. Pig stomach pieces had the right texture. The sesame black chicken was very nice.
Prices were reasonable and affordable.
It's air-con but noise can be loud because of the hard floor and paneling. Service was prompt and efficient.
When requested, because I'd no cash on me, propiretor HUANG BIN consented to TnG transfer which was great",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102327234239929217296/reviews
Wilson Shum,5,"Tried the bak kut teh here which is as the name says what they are good at.  It came out sizzling hot, the soup broth was herby but not too strong flavour and just the right level of saltiness.  This was the first time I tried authentic bak kut teh as i have tried other versions too and now I know the difference and this was way better.

The place is also got comfortable seating and quite spacious.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101823991036389546579/reviews
Lilian Clk,4,"Soup is light and not herb based, just pork soup. Only take cash, very inconvenient. Hope the owner can start cashless payment soon, otherwise really will not want to go there.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107121773955559672132/reviews
Yap Hoe BENG,4,"There are many Ba Kut Teh around the area, decided to try Shun Fa. The BKT was good with mixing of all the pig organ and others. The soup was just peppery and nice. You have to order first before getting a table. It was crowded during lunch times.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116220693681278781294/reviews
