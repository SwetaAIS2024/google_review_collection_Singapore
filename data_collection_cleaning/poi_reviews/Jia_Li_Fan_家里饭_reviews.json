My kids who didn't want to eat chicken rice for dinner initially have no complains afterwards. The sauce from the chicken was flavourful and I was slurping it up! Will be ordering for my father's birthday!",

The green chili was tangy and spicy enough... superb pairing with the chicken. The rice was also not the standard white rice but very fragrant ginger rice. Overall super value for money and super yummy. Shall try their fried chicken set soon.",
