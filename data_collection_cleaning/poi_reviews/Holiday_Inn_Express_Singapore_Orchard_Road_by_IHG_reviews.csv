Ayda Maya,5,"I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Duty Manager Naqiah for her outstanding service during my 'staycaymoon.' From the moment I arrived, she went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was not only comfortable but truly special. Her warmth, attentiveness, and professionalism made a lasting impression, and I genuinely appreciated the personalized care she provided.

She was always ready to assist with any requests, making sure every detail of my stay was perfect. Her friendly demeanor and willingness to go the extra mile truly enhanced the overall experience. Itâ€™s rare to come across such dedicated service, and I am incredibly grateful for the effort she put into making my time there so memorable.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, and I cannot thank Naqiah and the team enough for their hospitality. It was an experience I will cherish, and I will certainly be recommending this place to family and friends. Thank you once again for making my 'staycaymoon' so wonderful!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100340448815898266230/reviews

The rooms were very clean, fresh and cool.  We arrived at 6:30 am and was able to get an early check in after breakfast which was perfect.  The breakfast buffet had a variety options.  I would definitely recommend and visit again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102034438469764198644/reviews

Rebecca Chiu,4,"The hotel is in a good location on Orchard Road. There are many places to eat and shop nearby. To get to the nearest subway station, just cross the intersection at the traffic lights; it's at Somerset station, below the 313 mall. The rooms are clean, and the staff are friendly. The prices are reasonable. I recommend it.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101364366152874927722/reviews
