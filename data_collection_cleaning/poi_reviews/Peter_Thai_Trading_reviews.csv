Yi Ling,4,"Lovely Thai convenience store snuggled in the corners of the hdb areas of beach road! Patrons and stall owners are Thai, and walking past this shop really made me feel I transcended to Thailand for a brief moment.

It was a one-stop shop provisional store that sells dry and wet goods! There is even a fridge that sells tofu and fresh greens, too. Also, I saw a few instant noodle packets that I only saw in Bangkok here!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115707001285123682601/reviews

Ëå∂Êü±„Çø„ÉÑÂ≠ê,5,"From the storefront, it looks like a Thai üáπüá≠ minimart. Overcoming the temptation of side dishes, I keep buying them. The dishes that also have vegetables are typical of Thai cuisine. That's good! ! Sometimes you can also hear Thai. It's small but has all the basic things.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104950464093711576018/reviews
