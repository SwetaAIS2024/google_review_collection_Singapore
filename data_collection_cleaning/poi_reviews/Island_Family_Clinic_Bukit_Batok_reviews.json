Checked again on 4 Feb 2025, but the record still showed as no record found, so I decided to submit the record myself.\n\nI am truly disappointed with the service, especially given that such important information was not properly updated.",

Two days ago, I contracted a stomach bug and was in so much pain that I was quite surprised I didn’t faint on the way to the clinic and let alone in the waiting room.\n\nWhen I got there, the clinic was rather small and looked like it was run by only a 2-person team. The seating area was a tad cramped and uncomfortable but when you’re sick everything feels (or is conspiring to be) uncomfortable.\n\nThe receptionist was very gentle and patient with me which I’m grateful for. I felt that she was genuinely concerned that I was in so much pain.\n\nThough the wait felt long, when I finally saw the attending physician, Dr John-Paul, he got straight to the point and did a thorough examination and diagnosed me accurately and was comprehensive with his prescription.\n\nLong story short: everything worked well and I made full recovery in just 3 days! I’ve had stomach bugs in the past and I’ve never had such a short recovery time such as this.\n\nJust want to say thank you to the team :)",
