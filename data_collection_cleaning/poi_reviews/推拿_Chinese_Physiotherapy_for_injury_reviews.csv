Joey Lim,5,"I called and found out that they have moved to Bishan st 11. Still went down anyway, and Mr Seah helped with my back pains that have persisted for a week. It didn‚Äôt hurt during the session so I was surprised the pain was alleviated immediately after the session. It was also really affordable, I don‚Äôt think you can find prices like this anywhere. Go give it a try!
