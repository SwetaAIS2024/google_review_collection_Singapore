The staff mostly volunteers are really nice and friendly and helpful especially Lin, Jean & Meghan they do go the extra mile with their service these volunteers do give and enjoyable experience when thrifting there. There are higher price items like gold and silver which you can ask to view definitely cheaper than outside and they do have good deals sometimes you can even find Tiffany & Co if you are lucky!",
