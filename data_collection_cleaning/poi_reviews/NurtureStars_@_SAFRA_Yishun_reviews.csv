Byeol-I Kim,1,"My child was here for slightly over a year. Their class sizes are huge, more than 20 in a class in K1 ams K2 classes and it is clear that their teachers are overwhelmed. They are unable to provide emotional support to each child due to the large size of their classes. There have been many occasions whereby they delayed bringing my child to the toilet, prioritising their own work first, and resulting in my child wetting her pants. After which, she gets reprimanded for it even though she asked to use the toilet multiple times. This caused my child to develop a fear of going to the toilet outside of home.

The teaching methods are also questionable because my child is way behind her developmental milestones for her age. We started seeking external help during the last 2 months of her duration in this school  and she improved tremendously. This was the final push for us to switch her to a school with better curriculum and teaching processes.

The management and their admin team is very slack in their day to day operations. The first time I ever spoke to the principal was the day I submitted the notice of withdrawal. I think that's very telling of how they operate their business - with minimum or zero engagement with parents. Which I suspect this school culture trickles down to the way teachers interact with the children as well. The operations person is also pretty clueless about organisation SOP as she was not familiar with the rules in the parents handbook disseminated to us. I had to pull out the handbook to point out to her the basis of my queries, before she realises what I mean. Admin processes are also cumbersome as things are not processed promptly.

Overall, this is the worst school I have ever come across. I strongly urge you to look elsewhere. Anywhere is better than here.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114856966588434962491/reviews
chin saw wah,5,"My daughter graduated from this preschool last year. She was in the school from 2019 to 2023. Although there were a few round of teacher turnover while she was there, I had no qualms as all the teachers were caring to my child and my child like going to school. The school also prepares the child well for primary school, having them do worksheet and learn spelling from K1 and also practising buying things with money in K2. I also like their sports day which is a really big event with all the branches coming together.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115299540727950040439/reviews
