      "text": "The premium beef set came with a good spread, including A5 Wagyu Tartare, A5 Wagyu Karubi, Beef Rib, and Beef Plate, all grilled to perfection. Alongside, we had a hearty bowl of Seafood Kimchi Soup and a comforting plate of Nira Tama, which is stir-fried garlic chive with soft scrambled eggs.\nâ€¢\nTo make the experience even more indulgent, we added a few more items â€” Iberico Collar, Chicken Thigh (shio), and some juicy scallops.\nâ€¢\nThese were grilled together with an assortment of vegetables like shiitake and eringi mushrooms, Japanese sweet potato, onion, pumpkin, carrot, and baby corn â€” a balanced touch to all the meat.\nâ€¢\nThe side dishes also deserve a shoutout. Cold tofu with sesame sauce, spinach namuru, kimchi, pickled lotus root, bean sprouts (kon namuru), chuka wakame (seaweed), ajitamago goma, and shio cabbage â€” each was flavourful, and we even went back for seconds for most of them.\nâ€¢\nWhat stood out was the quality of the beef â€” the marbling was stunning, and most cuts only needed a quick sear on the grill before they were ready.",

The ingredients were fresh, and there was a huge variety of food to choose fromâ€”including different cuts of meat and a wide selection of seafood.\n\nOne thing I really appreciated was the strong ventilation systemâ€”unlike many other BBQ places, you donâ€™t walk out smelling like smoke and grilled meat, which is a big plus.\n\nMy only small pet peeve is that they use an electric grill instead of charcoal. While I always wonder if this affects the taste, I have to say the food still turned out great, so it wasnâ€™t really an issue.\n\nOverall, Iâ€™d definitely visit againâ€”a solid spot for yakiniku with fresh ingredients and a comfortable dining environment!",

      "text": "Went for a walk along the rail corridor and stumbled upon this yakiniku restaurant with set lunch. One can order any 2 items to make this a set, ie free bowl of rice, miso soup and small dishes (refillable). The small dishes are not bad particularly like their fried luncheon meat slices and sesame tofu. The meat portions are a bit small if you order premium cuts like wagyu, eg wagyu tare (sliced like a lady's pinky finger) but the quality overall not bad. My mom and my favorite is the king hanami. Service is not bad either, the place pretty empty in Christmas eve afternoon.",
