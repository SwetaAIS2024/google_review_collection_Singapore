Viv薇薇安,5,"I recently visited the Tan Tock Seng Heritage Museum in Singapore, and it was a fascinating experience. The museum showcases the rich history and heritage of the TTSH, and I was impressed by the collection of artifacts and exhibits.

One highlight of my visit was the virtual tour offered by the museum. I scanned the QR codes, which led me to YouTube videos narrated by Mr. Dennis Yep, the museum coordinator. His narration was informative and engaging, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of the history of Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

The museum also had a diverse range of photographs and displays that showcased the hospital's evolution over the years. It was fascinating to see how it has transformed and played a crucial role in Singapore's healthcare system.

Overall, my visit to the Tan Tock Seng Heritage Museum was educational and enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in exploring the history and heritage of TTSH.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113019870660151627817/reviews
