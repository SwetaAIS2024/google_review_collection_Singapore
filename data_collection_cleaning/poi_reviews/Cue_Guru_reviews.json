So do take note and bring $50 cash before coming here. Overall my experience here was so-so.",

(I saw in a previous review a month ago about a complaint about this person and it looks like she has not changed)\nSecondly, a male staff member used language that also came off as rude saying words like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù have some respect for yourself and the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù you ‚Äúrun‚Äù.\nThey are only interested in charging you and squeezing your wallets dry, for example they have a policy where if you come in a big group you are required to buy a beverage from their bar (what nonsense, my first time hearing of such a rule at a  place to play pool)\nI have never felt more scammed and unwelcomed at a pool place. Went there once and never going there ever again there are much better pool places charge significantly less and the service is better.\n1h can charge almost 20+ dollars, the bottle water we bought was 3.80 SGD crazy!",
