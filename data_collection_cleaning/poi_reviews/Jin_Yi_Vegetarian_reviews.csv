Food is good
Very tasty and well done

Definitely better then the neighbouring stalls who are either rude or inconsistent standards",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109099582461689175620/reviews
Sunny M,3,"Date of visit : Tue 1st Sep 2024
Time : 8.45 pm

First time trying this stall.

Ordered the yam ring priced at $20 and 1 rice at $0.70.

The yam is over fried, slightly dry and taste slightly sourish.
The soya bean imitations of the meat aren’t tasty. Too many pieces.

This review is based only the yam ring dish.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116788322544213433170/reviews
Vallariaー,3,"A friend recommended this store and there's so many good reviews so decided to give it a try.
There was a long line so we waited some time for the food to be served.

Price:
$30++ for 2
Slightly expensive for hawker food

Taste:
It's relatively normal for all dishes and nothing spectacular.

There are so many better options out there with a fraction of the price.
If you do visit, I would recommend you to get one main course instead of zi char.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110668937344581043972/reviews

Food is also great and is one of those few wok hey style vegetarian cooking.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100121856768061827324/reviews
