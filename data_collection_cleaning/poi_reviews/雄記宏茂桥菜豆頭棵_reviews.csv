Tsin W61,4,"Operated by an old couple, fast serving but need to fried a bit longer to get  more crispy carrot cake. Reasonable price as there are more than 3 carrot cake stalls in Tampines Round market. Parking lots are available for visitors but need to wait for lot during weekend morning breakfast time but very quite during dinner time as most of the stall closed.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112246979209348273781/reviews
