Kelyn Lim,5,"We sent our adopted fur kid to Punggol Plaza Pets' Street for grooming. Nicky was a very timid and fearful boy, but QQ is both professional and gentle with him, making him feel comfortable. I feel very reassured knowing QQ will take great care of my fur kid.

I will definitely recommend her to my friends and will continue sending Nicky there for his grooming.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113224863067479674955/reviews
HuiXuan Chen,5,"Was recommended last year by a fellow dog lover to try out Pets‚Äô Street‚Äôs grooming services. Best decision ever. Decent pricing, responsible staffs and groomers.

There was once Baby had some minor irritation on her skin after a grooming session, Pet Street staffs continued to follow up with us after we feedback to them. ü´∂üèªüôå

Thank you Groomer QQ for the wonderful grooming sessions for Baby as always‚Ä¶ Baby has always been super active, but QQ has always been patient with her.

See you for the next session!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104314684717961011594/reviews
