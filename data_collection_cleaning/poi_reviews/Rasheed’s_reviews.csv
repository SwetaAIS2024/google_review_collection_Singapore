TCH,3,"Indian owner kopitiam here in Tuas Basin.  The Kopi O is Okay for me and the queue for beverages is rather long. This place is kept rather clean and provided with Round Marble Tables and good support chairs for patrons.

Tried the Economical Bee Hoo stall and I ordered the Kway Teow and Mee combi; the Kway Teow has the char Taste which is good on my opinion!

Many workers from the nearby offices popped in for breakfast. Many choices of Indian food here and the western grill and pasta which I would definitely like to try on my next trip here!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467592239988127131/reviews
