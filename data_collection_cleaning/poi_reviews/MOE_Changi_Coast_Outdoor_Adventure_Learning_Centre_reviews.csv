TSANG ZI HENG Student,3,"The overall experience was great. Toilets were very very dirty as itâ€™s filled with sand. Food served in buffet format. Desert was great and we had second servings. Instructor was kind and helpful.
Would want to visit again.

YONG LOK YAN Student,4,"Overall experience was really good. The toilets were not THAT dirty, just a lot of wet sand on the floor which isn't too bothering unless you drop something on the floor (which would be very unpleasant)
The dorms are clean, except for a bit of sand at the entrance (there's sand everywhere in the campsite)
The campsite is quite confusing for the first few days and I got lost multiple times.
Airplane noises were not too bad, just a few flyovers. Highly recommend bringing earplugs ESPECIALLY FOR LIGHT SLEEPERS
Sleeping in tents was ok, just a little stuffy and warm. Don't worry about wet clothes as there are wires outside the dorms to hang wet clothes. The food was quite bad but it should be bearable.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108569984472762171076/reviews
Yixuan Li,2,"It is very noisy at night because of the planes. The toilets are very dirty and filled with sand. Do not recommend going there. Very boring activities and must use recycled water* to clean our plates.
*they just use a very simple filter to filter the dirty water and reuse it.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102935634274972914896/reviews
