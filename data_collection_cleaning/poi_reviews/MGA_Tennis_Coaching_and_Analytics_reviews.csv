Shawn Koh,5,"Terence has been a patient and awesome coach!

Been with him for more than a year now, from 0 experience of playing tennis, to hitting the balls comfortably and confidently now.

What I really value so far is his instant feedback, and how he can spot the mistakes immediately and give you recommendations to correct it.

So if you need a patient coach, who reduces the learning curve in tennis greatly, Terence is definitely the person to go to! 10/10 will always recommend him.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110616082657268100804/reviews
Terence Tan,5,"An excellent coach with extensive knowledge of tennis, from the technical aspect of ground strokes to point construction in a match. Terence is also very patient when coaching, ensuring you understand and take away something beneficial every lesson.

Have been with him for the past year and he is fast to catch on any mistakes. He then uses different drills/equipments to help you correct your form to improve the quality of your strokes and prevent injuries.

Would totally recommend anyone from any level who is keen on learning tennis or hoping to improve their game.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103743655291744852612/reviews

Terence is a great coach who has a deep understanding of the game. He is patient and can give clear, useful, and reasoned instructions on how to improve your strokes. He has also helped me to identify my strengths and use them to construct points.
He is definitely the person to go to if you are serious about taking your tennis to the next level!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117356115063048801435/reviews
Coby Ang,5,Terence is really a great tennis coach. He is patient and doesn’t expect you to follow 100% the ‘correct’ method of every stroke. Your comfortability is more important. He tiers his knowledge to what u want to achieve during your sessions. Very recommendable coach for beginners or recreational players who want to better their strokes,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108055708678060843229/reviews
