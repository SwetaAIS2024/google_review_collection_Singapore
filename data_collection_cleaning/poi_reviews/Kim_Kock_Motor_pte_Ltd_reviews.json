In the end, quoted 3 times higher then what market has offer comparison with those much more bigger player...anyway my scooter major servcing belt replacement only cost 165 to 200 and this shop quoted me 450 and I did it at other shop at 185 sgd.. no integrity..",

      "text": "Very Very Expensive shop! Once I visited because of my motor break down. They diagnosed and found CID and starter rely were defective. And they quoted for those parts almost 3 times of actual price I could get it from parts dealer in Singapore, in addition to that they also imposed me labor charge for the parts.  I told them the pricing is too high!! but they informed that we don't like to repair and ask me take back the vehicle. Due to time constrain, i ended up in repairing my motor at high pricing. My motor was not able to start, they used the scenario to suck money from me. Before you go to this work shop think twice. Otherwise they will suck your money.",
