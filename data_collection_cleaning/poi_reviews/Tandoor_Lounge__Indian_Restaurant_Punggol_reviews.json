The outside sitting chair were uncomfortable though. Quite high and cramped also when Toddler sits they can reach table height, they don't hav booster seat as well. Food was good though, order from the app directly. I would say it was at pricy side. Lot of options to choose from. The plaza has many other food options. Also can have nice stroll after your food. Overall nice place to chill and njoi food.",
