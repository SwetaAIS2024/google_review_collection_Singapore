Natalia Tan,1,"Went there for dinner, not very crowded. Looked forward to the food but it was such a disapppointment. The sukiyaki hotpot set was SO sweet like we knew its supposed to be sweet, but this was over the top like candy kind of sweet and no other savoury nice taste...
It was hard to eat it honestly.
Since it was so sweet, i wanted some water to dilute it and explained to the staff but they said its chargable which i understand but im not drinking it i wanted to add in. Later, the staff came back after a while and said they can add water in the soup so they took my meal and added in thr kitchen. Still tasted bad but at least abit better.
We also ordered matcha brownie and honestly it was so small like miniature size, and worse for the price. tasted ok.
Definitely traumatised and will NOT come back.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113521220615615806152/reviews
Hau Wen Hui,3,the mentaiko udon and drinks was really good but the fries was a bit too salty. the desserts was a bit weird to because of the hot and cold mix  (personal preference) and the dorayaki was too dry inside. other than that had a pleasant experience here and the staff are very nice!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114241511237341226092/reviews
Ferdiantono Lim,4,"I was looking for Don Don Donki in Orchard Central but stumbled upon this matcha place that also serves Japanese meals: Maccha House. Since I’d been craving authentic Japanese matcha ever since my trip to Japan, I decided to give it a try.

I ordered their uji matcha tiramisu, which was amazing and came with complimentary tea. The only downside was the worn-down utensils and the overall interior—while unpretentious, it also felt a bit cheap for Singapore mall standard.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117289056511151480296/reviews
Wei Yuet Wong,4,"January 2025
- Had Kimchi hotpot, Carbonara pasta, oysters, and matcha tiramisu.
- Food was okay; it's difficult to get Kimchi hotpot wrong...
- Enjoyed the Matcha tiramisu.
- There was an on-going promotion of $10 discount if you order 2 main courses, and dessert. It was not applied in the final bill, but was rectified after I informed the service staff.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115813794678746190258/reviews
Sharon Stone,3,"Having tried their Kyoto stores I was excited to give Maccha house at Orchard road a shot.

We ordered the following:
Vanilla/ matcha soft serve;
Kyoto matcha tiramisu;
Matcha brownie;
Iced matcha latte.

The matcha/vanilla soft serve is actually not bad and a good soft serve for on-the-go.

Their matcha tiramisu lacked the matcha punch that we were expecting and left us quite underwhelmed.

The matcha brownie is a definite no-order. The brownie was too dense, too fatty and the flavours did not match. The dish might have been theatrical, yet do not recommend ordering it.

Last but not least, the iced matcha latte. The latte tasted of matcha sugar milk without it actually having the proper smoothness.

I am unsure if this maccha house is unfiliated to the ones in Japan, yet in quality they are definitely not the same. (Nor can be compared)

As a matcha lover this left me underwhelmed and will not come again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105991329076805258323/reviews
