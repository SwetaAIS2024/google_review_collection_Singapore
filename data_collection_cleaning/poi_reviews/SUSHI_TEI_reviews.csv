I W,3,"My lunch kaki and I felt like eating Japanese food and decided to give Sushi Tei a try.  The restaurant was well patronised at lunchtime on a weekday, and we were seated at the counter instead of at a table.  We were hungry and quite excited about our meal.

We ordered our dishes based on the pictures in the menu.  Both of us couldn't help feeling disappointed when our orders arrived.

I ordered UnaBara Chirashi Don ($22.80), whilst my lunch kaki ordered Ringo Madai Bara Don ($17.80), a seasonal dish.  Please compare the menu pictures with what was served.  You can't see any rice in the menu picture because each bowl is so full of ingredients.  But the dishes we were served looked noticeably different.  My lunch kaki exclaimed:  ""My dish looks pathetic!""

No complaints about freshness of the ingredients.  I felt the rice was on the hard side whereas my lunch kaki was ok with the rice.

Service could have been improved.  There were times when we had difficulty attracting the attention of the restaurant's staff even though we were seated right in front of them at the counter.

It takes a special skill not to be able to see me, as I am quite big size and I was frantically waving hands over my head to catch their attention.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107686746966044708528/reviews

Chinee Loh,5,"Food here is fantastic with a nice view! Got the nabeiyaki udon which is always consistently good ü´∂. Love the mango crab maki as well, the mango was so sweet! Look at that deep yellow / orange color ü•∞üß°.
