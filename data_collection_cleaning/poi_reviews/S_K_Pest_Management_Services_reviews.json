      "text": "I engage SK PEST MANAGEMENT SERVICES  on the on the 5 Aug 2021 to carried out Bedbug services at my place after speaking to three other PCO I decided to engage SK pest Mr rajesh to carried the.services .He arrived on time ,after inspection he explained in details  what he is doing and the.level of infestations I was having. Worried he  won\nT be able to solve my problem as many bigger company Pest control had  also make promising promise but did not solve my problem.After treatment, all the adult Bedbug was dead ,was happy with the treatment. As what he told me after 5days ,I won,t see anymore adults bedbugs and arranged another round of treatment earlier in 11days ,based on my feedback .After second treatment all my bedbug was gone .I was so happy, I even got him to do my roaches infestations that too he done an excellent job with all the roaches dead after treatment. He was even so alert ,and was able to detect a drywood problem at my place ..and explained me the procedure. Got him to do it ,if not more damaged would had happened at my wooden flooring .\nI highly recommend S K Pest management services. Although they are medium size local company they are very efficient and even better then bigger company or foreign company ,who did not solve my problem\nThumb up S K pest management services for your  excellent worked and service  Thanks for solving all my problems. üòÅ",
