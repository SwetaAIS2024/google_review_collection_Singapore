      "text": "We visited this vet clinic today with my beloved dog and I cannot speak highly enough of our experience. Receptionists were very welcoming! Everyone was friendly & service was good! They ensured that both our pet and we felt comfortable throughout our visit. They handled my dog with care and gentleness which instantly reassured us that my dog will be in good hands. My dog usually shivers when she visits the clinic but this time she was pretty well behaved because of the staffs!\n\nDoctor Anise is highly skilled and knowledgeable. She also took time to explain my dog’s condition and treatment options after the blood test. Patiently answering all of our questions and addressing any concerns we had.\n\nWhat truly sets this vet clinic apart is the level of compassion and dedication they demonstrate towards their furry patients and their owners. If you’re looking for a vet clinic where your pet will receive top notch care in a welcoming and compassionate environment, this is the best place! We are incredibly grateful to have found a wonderful place & wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone in need of veterinary services!\n\nThank you Mag, Piya, Zuzu & Doctor Anise!",

On top of that, he is meticulous, patient and takes time to listen to our concerns.\n\nDr Melissa even went the extra mile to give me a call upon learning my puppy did not respond well to medication for kennel cough, although she was not my puppy’s attending doctor. She provided advice over the phone and my puppy got better.\n\nThe nurses/ receptionists are extremely efficient. I can simply book an appointment or ask questions via WhatsApp and get a response within minutes.\n\nThank you Dr Nicholas, Dr Melissa and Team!",

I was shocked to learn that I had to wait until all other customers had completed their appointments before being served.\n\nThe lack of communication and poor customer service was appalling. I feel sorry for the doctor, who deserves better support staff. Based on my experience, I would strongly advise against visiting this place.",

Apex was quick with picking up my calls, finding a time slot for me & also allowing me to drop down earlier if my cat’s symptoms got worse which is comforting. Front desk receptionist is super sweet, the vet was detailed and quick with diagnosis. They were thorough and overall very pleasant experience. Would come again.",
