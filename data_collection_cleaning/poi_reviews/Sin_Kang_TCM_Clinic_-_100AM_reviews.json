      "text": "Went to see the TCM at this clinic, wanting to treat my thyroid condition. My chinese is not very proficient and I requested for English as the main communication language, which they said they can do. I can understand basic Chinese but nothing further. Consultation was done in a mix of languages but the doctor could only explain the basics in English.\n\nDoctor said medication + acupuncture for the treatment. I wasn't aware that the acupuncture done is a \"slimming\" acupuncture which is not what I was looking for. It was only reflected in my bill afterwards.\n\nAfter treatment, the area of acupuncture was sore and the physician said it was normal and should fade within 2 days. My pain lasted a week and was still painful. I visited a GP, had xray done to ensure no foreign body. The GP thinks the needles caused infection, and that infection is causing the pain.\n\nSeriously, never again, and at $291 for the TCM alone, it is very costly and time-consuming, for a treatment that I'm not even sure is accurate or effective. Costs were also not transparent from the beginning\n\nAlso counted 25 needles and only one single swab was used to disinfect the insertion areas. Probably should have used more swabs.",

      "text": "Visited for a consultation with doctor followed by tuina.\n\n1. Not much comments about the consultation and doctor except that price point is very high. $40 for consult and $110 for medication.\n\n2. The main issue is tuina. Both receptionist and tuina therapist was so keen to hardsell me. I rejected multiple times and was still asked again and again and again. Many comments about how the normal tuina (which cost $80!) is not useful and you should upgrade to the pain therapy which costs something like $138. Tuina is already supposed to achieve pain relief, isn't it? Why is there need to upgrade? Extremely annoying and unprofessional. They deliberately hold back on service to convince you that not upgrading was the wrong choice.\n\nWill not be going back.",
