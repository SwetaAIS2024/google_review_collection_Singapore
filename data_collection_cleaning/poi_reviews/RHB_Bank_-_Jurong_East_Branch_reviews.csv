Philip Chew,5,I cane to Jurong East branch on 8th May at around 3.15pm to do a FD deposit served by a female lady staff of counter 2. Her efficiency and caring for the clients is of excellent performance. She managed to process my FD in a very short period of time in order to meet the cut off time of clearing. Strongly recommend a compliment and keep up in her good work.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114630537971524317329/reviews

Sky Bluemoody,5,I don‚Äôt normally post any reviews but today visit at RHB bank is a wonderful experience for me. Edmund Ong has been very helpful and professional in helping me open up a FD account. He guided me step by step and the whole process has been quick and thorough. I would like to give him a thumb up for the good job and hope he will continue such good work and get recognised.üëçüëçüëç,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107794511653134597329/reviews
