      "text": "Avenue Lounge Singapore: Where you pay $50 to relive the worst parts of 2016—without even the courtesy of a free drink.\n\nThe DJ? Completely checked out, possibly operating on autopilot or just Googling “how to look busy.”\n\nThe music? A tragic time capsule of outdated tracks butchered by mixes so bad they should come with a trigger warning.\n\nThe crowd? Practically non-existent. They closed off sections like they were embarrassed too—which, honestly, they should be. The vibe is so dead even a funeral would feel insulted.\n\nSave your money, your night, and your ears, this place is a hard pass.",

      "text": "I want to share some feedback about a really disappointing experience I had at Avenue. As a long time customer, I’ve always enjoyed coming here, but this time things went terribly wrong. I went to the bar to order a Negroni and a these waiter took my credit card to process the payment but never gave it back. When I politely asked GABRIEL (Chinese waiter) for help, he became aggressive, slammed his hand on the table, and started shouting at me. It was completely unprofessional and shocking. I’m planning to file a police report, and I really hope Avenue management takes this seriously and addresses the situation, as it reflects poorly on the entire establishment. I trust this won’t happen to anyone else.",

They said the minimum spend is 1k and we are unable to just buy 1 bottle of gin!\n\nWe stayed there for awhile and left shortly after at 11pm and head off to another night establishment!\n\nService staff was rude and not flexible! If you’re broke AF, enter at your own risk!",
