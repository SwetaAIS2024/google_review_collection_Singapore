Kai,5,"This elegant lounge is out of the world!

The service and food is impeccable! The service staffs are friendly and attentive. I love how they serve the food directly to table after you ordered.

Next, this lounge serves various entrees and appetisers which is very different from usual buffet style business class lounge. Not to mentioned the food are definitely of a high quality üëçüèª

This lounge is definitely on par or even better than many first class lounge I had been to.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117612273412230021726/reviews

LG Tan,5,"I have been using Asia Treasure Lounge for many years. It may be a small lounge but it is definitely a  nice and quiet lounge to be in before boarding. The variety of food may be limited, but they are tasty. The service staff are generally attentive and prompt in serving the food and drinks.

About the new look‚Ä¶ it is looking like a cafeteria but the ambient is still pleasure.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112355057829299616323/reviews
