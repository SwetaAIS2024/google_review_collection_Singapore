      "text": "üå∏ Beautiful Products with a Heart üå∏\nSense Of Arts creates stunning Singapore-inspired pressed flower products, souvenirs, and gifts. Their workshops with recycled real pressed flowers are fun for both kids and adults!\n\nWhat I love most is their Community Pressed Flowers Project, which supports mothers, needy families, and individuals with disabilities by providing income opportunities through handicrafts. Such a meaningful cause!\n\nTheir outlets at Gardens by the Bay and Singapore Botanic Gardens are easy to find, and the website is super user-friendly. Highly recommend checking them out for unique gifts or a creative workshop!\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",
