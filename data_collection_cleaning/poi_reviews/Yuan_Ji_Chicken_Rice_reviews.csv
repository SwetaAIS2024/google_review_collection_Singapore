Sheng,1,"Had ordered roast duck and charsiew rice. Portion of the duck was miniscule, which made me wonder if it was a one-off or if it was a different person behind the counter. Because every other time I've eaten here, they serve a good of meat. And at $5.50, you'd expect a decent amount of meat. So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered a second plate of duck and roast pork rice. To my horror, the portion was the same; measly. If you look at the picture, you can see the amount of duck they gave me in my second plate; more skin than meat, and the slices are small and flattened to absolute smithereens. A travesty.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106087228995573038993/reviews
Bob Lu,4,"Wanton noodles reasonably priced at S$3.50, char siu is pretty good with char edges and equal amount of fats and lean meat. Quite generous with the lard bits and sambal chilli and the chilli is quite decent for wanton mee. I added some ginger into the wanton noodles and it tasted decently acceptable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102417187419000284994/reviews
CBP,5,The best old school type of chicken rice in paper wrapping. I've been buying from this stall for many years and chicken portion is generous and yummy. They gave achar instead of cucumbers. Price is reasonable. Roast chicken +roast pork rice is only $5.50.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103691610785974721152/reviews
