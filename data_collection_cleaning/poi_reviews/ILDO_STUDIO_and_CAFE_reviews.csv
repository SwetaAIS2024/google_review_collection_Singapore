Sasi Em≈ëke,5,"It's a perfect place to occupy your little one with arts and krafts. The conductors are super nice and little ones love them.
I have seen there are more krafty projects available for older kids. That must be fun too. When my girl gets older I will bring her for those as well.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106448815331374947316/reviews

DR. ALVIN TUNG,5,"Honestly, the best bingsu that I have ever had! The ice was shaved so incredibly fine and the portion was humongous! The ice cream on top was very rich and creamy. The mango was very ripe and fresh and the portions were very generous! It took four of us to finish the one bowl! A very well-kept local secret in the basement of this modest looking Mall.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104044951295366590832/reviews
Koh Qi Cheng,5,Had the Injeolmi Bingsu. Average tasting. Bought Bingsu because craving for it. Really friendly staff and quaint place to chill at. Next to a studio rental and also there are taekwondo classes just next to it. Good for parents waiting for their kids. They also have some seats for work. There's charging stations and also free WiFi.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118211129222775025718/reviews
