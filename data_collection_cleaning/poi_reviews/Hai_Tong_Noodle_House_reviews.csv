Alvin Choo,2,Ordered their large wanton mee with additional dumplings ($6.50). The soup was rather bland and both the wanton and dumplings didn't taste very seasoned. The noodles were also rather average. It's likely that this will be my first and last purchase here.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews

Rather meh - at best
