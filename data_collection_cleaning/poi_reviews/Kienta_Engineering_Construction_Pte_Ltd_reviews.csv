Penny Tham,1,"Kienta under HIP is disappointing! Poor quality and workmanship, and lacking in good customer service.
Had a leak issue, which Kienta supervisor in charge said easy fix. After done, the leak was worse than ever! Tried to get them to rectify and was told a number of lies! In the end, they just totally stop replying, and I’m guessing it’s because they received payment for HIP so they don’t care anymore! Totally horrible!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101092604429785690187/reviews
