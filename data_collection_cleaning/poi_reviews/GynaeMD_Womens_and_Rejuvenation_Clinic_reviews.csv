Becky Song,5,"I recently had a consultation regarding abnormal bleeding, and I couldn’t be more pleased with the care and professionalism I received. Dr Ng took the time to listen to my concerns, explain possible causes clearly, and walk me through the next steps.

He recommended a hysteroscope procedure to get a better look inside the uterus, and I felt completely reassured by how thoroughly everything was explained. Their calm and compassionate approach really helped ease my anxiety. I truly appreciate the thoughtful and attentive care—it made a stressful situation much easier to manage.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101472831836978961272/reviews
