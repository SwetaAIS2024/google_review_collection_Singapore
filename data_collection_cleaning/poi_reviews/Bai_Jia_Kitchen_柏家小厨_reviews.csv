Zhixiang Chee Siong,4,"Beef Fried Rice was fairly well done, the portion of beef was quite generous too. Most of it were hidden under the rice and hence can't be seen. Worth visiting again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101494858664707763825/reviews
X Lou,1,"super small portion size. Worst hor fun and e mian I have ever eaten. Tasteless. My home cooked noodles are way better. prawn paste chicken is a strange colour and doesn't taste as it should. Bad, bad and bad",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118337726175097318213/reviews
Zheng Whye Hui,5,"One of the only stores open at the food center at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon.

Ordered seafood hor fun (wet means with gravy). Would say its a healthier option if you give no instructions. Prawns are surprisingly fresh and springy. Sauce is light in taste and easy to slurp.

If you prefer a more traditional option, recommend for them to fry the hor fun ""blacker"" and ask for gravy to be ""heavier"" in taste.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113428268467885703547/reviews
