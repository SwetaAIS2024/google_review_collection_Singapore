Annette Kang,5,"I would like to express my most sincere thanks to Miss Melly and Dr. Andrea. Their dedication to patient care truly stands out.

Melly’s dedication and genuine care make an incredible difference in ensuring patients feel supported during their visits. Her great dedication to both her job and to the patients is simply amazing. She is always patient, understanding, and genuinely cares about everyone she interacts with. She seems to be very well-liked by most of the patients when I was there for my appointment.

Similarly, Dr. Andrea’s compassion and her efforts to ease patient stress showcase her commitment not only to physical health but also to emotional well-being. It's a privilege to share the experience of healthcare professionals who are so devoted to improving the patient journey.

Once again, thank you so much, Melly and Dr Andrea.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112209724711862605150/reviews
