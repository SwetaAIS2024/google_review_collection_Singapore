      "text": "Underrated health screening center. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at their service! It took 3 hours in total for the premier package. All the staff were very nice and friendly even at 8:45 in the morning. The place was big, clean and peaceful. The nurse taking blood is clearly skilled. Both of us didn't feel much and had our blood drawn easily with no issues. The other nurse and doctor doing basic checks are friendly and gave us good advice. The counter staff advised us on the appropriate package without upselling on unneeded tests for our age group. We received voucher for coffee and sandwich or porridge at the cafe inside the hospital. The only quibble is the long wait for the ultrasound but again the technician who did is extremely detailed. Overall, very good experience, better compared to Mount Elizabeth and Fullerton.",

      "text": "Was interested in pursuing a health screening package with MA. When choosing the date of preference on its website, it misled that Sundays is an option as there were no footnote to indicate otherwise and that the dates are actually selectable. Upon submission, an officer followed up informing they do not operate on Sundays. Even as the officer’s follow up email was very prompt, it was short and didn’t even offered any alternative slots or solutions. That is, until I enquirer further with another email back. Needless to say, was underwhelmed by the entire consumer experience and thought this might serve as prelude should I pursue further with them. In short, I took my business somewhere else after this unfortunate experience.",

When the test results was out in the afternoon on the day of screening, they immediately called my brother to tell him about the abnormality found in the blood test of my dad so that we can take immediate action. And on the day of review, she nudged us again that we should see a GP for a re-test. I want to thank her for her nudging and luckily I managed to send my dad to the A&E in a private hospital and my dad was found to have cancer after various scans .",

      "text": "Called the health screening centre, and was put on hold, i would be attended to shortly bythe next available officer. Or press 1 for a call back. Just to test the system, i decided to hold and put the call on speakerphone. 1 hr 30  minutes later, still no answer! So at the next prompt, i pressed 1 for a callback. Failed to work. The  message kept repeating. So I try again, calling on the landline. 35 minutes now, no answer both lines. So now what? At the end of the day, it is clear that these lines are not manned which then forces us to visit in person to get some personal service. Terrible, for such a supposedly upmarket facility. So far not impressed.",
