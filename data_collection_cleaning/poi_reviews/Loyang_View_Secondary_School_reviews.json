They’ve taught me valuable skills, built my confidence and shaped how I approach real world challenges. These opportunities have definitely left a huge impact on me whether it is learning new skills I could apply for the future I can uphold or the bond I make with friends and I will forever remember them.",

This helped me gain resilience and helped me grow to be more willing and enthusiastic to learn and understand. This would have not been possible without the support of the school and teachers and all the memories and learnings with my friends will not be forgotten and will help me to strive in the future.",
