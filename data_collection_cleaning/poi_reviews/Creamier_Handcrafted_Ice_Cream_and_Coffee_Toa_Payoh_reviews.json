      "text": "Creamier is the place to go to place for waffles and ice cream. The waffles are the best in the market so far. The flavours are thick and flavourful. The usual favourites are the earl grey lavender, pistachio and strawberries. For those who love the king of fruit, they have 3 variation flavours...tried one but am not too impressed. I like it that there is a constant push for innovation and there are new flavours being pushed out constantly. Creamier folks, if you are reading this, please bring back the 'old' flavours like cranberry volka and other flavours with alcohol...rum and raisin is just too basic. Those good old ones in my opinion were the best flavours that you had to offer. I constantly bought the pints for myself and as gifts.",

      "text": "Walking into Creamier Handcrafted Ice Cream and Coffee in Toa Payoh is an experience. The enticing aroma of freshly made waffles envelops you, immediately tempting your taste buds to indulge a little more than planned. I opted for two scoops of ice cream, and they did not disappoint. The flavours were rich and delightful, elevating my experience to a creamy delight. While the waffles may be somewhat bland, they provide the perfect balance when combined with the sweet ice cream. This harmonious pairing showcased the ice cream's vibrant flavours beautifully. The signature sauce added was the cherry on top, expertly drizzled to enhance the overall dish without overwhelming it. It was made with care, complementing the waffles and ice cream wonderfully. Overall, Creamier offers a cosy ambience with delicious treats that are hard to resist. Whether you’re a waffle lover or an ice cream aficionado, this place is worth a visit – just be prepared to leave with more than you originally intended!",
