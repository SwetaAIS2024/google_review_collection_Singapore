The total cost was about $300, reasonable price as tooth fillings are higher priced anyway. Minimal discomfort during the procedure and also got clear explanations from the dentist. Can use cashless methods such as credit card PayWave. There's a water cooler available. I plan to come back for regular checks and cleanings.",

      "text": "Would highly recommend Dr Richard!\n\nHe did my wisdom teeth extraction, he explained all the options I could have, such as doing all 4 in one go or do 1 side at a time, and the pros and cons of each option. He lets me know I can raise my hand if I feel pain. The discomfort during procedure was bearable, his easy going nature and jokes make the exp more comfortable. Recovery was quite smooth, swelling was not noticeable at all if there was even any. The recovery pain was so bearable I didn't even use any painkillers.\n\nFor routine cleaning, he spots signs of teeth weakening, he is very good at educating on proper teeth and gum care, and how tooth decay happens, all this without any form of shame at all. Using shame and embarrassment is an awful and hurtful tactic used during school dentist visits in my childhood, I didn't dare to visit dentists for years, so I'm thankful now I always come back routinely thanks to Dr Richard!\n\nReceptionist is also handles admin stuff and payment in a friendly manner!",

I think Dr. Teo (Jian Kiat), was fantastic at explaining everything and making sure I felt super comfortable at every step! I’ll definitely come back here for more treatment. I think Dr. Teo and BoBo make a fantastic team! Regards, Zephyr",
