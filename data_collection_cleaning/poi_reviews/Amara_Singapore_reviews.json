      "text": "Rooms\n-You might want to check the water temperature at R1420. I experienced the water temperature switched from cold to hot, and from hot to cold several times when I showered.\n-Love how the hotel provides water dispenser in the room.\n-Can tell the hotel room are renovated recently (still have the newly smell)\n-Love the layout and the design of the room. Super spacious\n\nStaff\n-Friendly staff overall. We booked 2 rooms (family + deluxe king), the first FD staff told us they could not arrange both rooms at the same floor in the beginning due to high occupancy but the other FD staff assisted us to arranged both rooms at the same floor, super helpful!\n\nFood\n-Definitely not a \"5-star level\" breakfast. Could have more choices if the hotel considers itself as a \"5-star\" hotel. The breakfast could only count as \"continental breakfast\" but with \"few hot dishes provided\". I have stayed at other 5 star hotels in SG and I can tell the breakfast choices of a 5-star hotel could be more than this.",

      "text": "Pros: Great hotel, loved the room! It felt very clean, modern and spacious. We had to do some work remotely and there was plenty of room for two of us to work in the hotel room. Breakfast was good, but avoid going on the busy hours. Great location, many restaurants and cafes near by.\n\nCons:\nI wish the reception was located better - now it feels like it‚Äôs blocking the way\nGym needs a renovation- perhaps this is already being planned(?)",
