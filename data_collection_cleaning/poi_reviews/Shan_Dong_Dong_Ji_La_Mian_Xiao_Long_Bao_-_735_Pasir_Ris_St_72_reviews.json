Beef tripe was soft and tender, noodles was evenly cooked and easily coated with the sauce.\n\nLarge amount of veggie was also appreciated.\n\nWill come again.\n\nSorry for the photo, I finished it ðŸ¤£",

The chicken feet were not fresh and poorly cleaned, making the whole experience even more underwhelming. This felt like a complete mismatch between expectations and reality. I hope they improve both the quality and consistency of their dishes.",

Run by a mainland Chinese couple, we ordered both the fried dumplings and the chill oil dumplings were both tasty and such value for money $5/ 10 PCs. Tried the mince meat noodles ( Jjajangmyeon) and pickled cucumber and our bill came up to only $18! Very delicious and ambience in this new coffee shop is very clean and pleasant.",

I like the beef which is tender and yummy. However, I would prefer if the beef were of bigger chunks.\nService is quick and orderly.",
