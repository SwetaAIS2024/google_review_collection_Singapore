Their Guinness is on draft (I hate the can one). 1 pint is 17$, tax and service included, which is the most affordable one in the area or even Singapore. They play catchy music. The owner, Michael is very welcoming. He talked to almost every guest and even gave us a half pint on the house because it was his birthday. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAN!ü•≥üòéüç∫",
