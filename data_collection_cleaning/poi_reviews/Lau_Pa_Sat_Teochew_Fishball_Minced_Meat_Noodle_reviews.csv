Ivan Teh,4,"Bak Chor Mee (SGD $4) @ Lau Pa Sat Teochew Fishball Minced Meat Noodle.
.
What stands out here is the old-school blend of gravy with a decently enticing flavour, the chewy noodles, and the thick yet tender pork slices with a meaty bite.
.
The dumplings are hand made, bursting with meaty salty sweet savoury flavour.
.
Also like the unique addition of bean sprouts, which lend a fresh crisp texture.

Fish Ball Noodles (SGD $4) @ Lau Pa Sat Teochew Fishball Minced Meat Noodle.
.
The old-school gravy blends coats the chewy noodles well, lending enticing savoury sour spicy flavours.
.
A literal handful of bean sprouts and crisp spring onions lend vegetal sweet herbal notes, and a satisfying crunch.
.
The fish balls and fish cake are lightly bouncy with mild sweet savoury flavour, sized a tad larger than most.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114332345573544911646/reviews
Sean Goh,4,"Chance upon this stall selling fishball noodle sometime back while running some errands around this area, they were already closed for that day. Came back the following day at a much earlier time. There wasn’t any queue when I came back, managed to order upon reaching the stall. Price for the minced meat noodle starts from SGD$4 onwards,

The bowl of noodle came with a variety of ingredients likefishcake, pork slices, dumpling, minced pork , fish paste dumpling, fishball and meatball. Noodle were nicely cooked, texture of the noodle was springy. Sauce was well balanced too. Portion was quite generous, as it was a filling meal.

Overall, I think that this is an above average bowl of noodle and wouldn’t mind eating it again.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Aertsa L,5,"I love the BCM here, especially when ordered with extra chilli. I usually get the $4 bowl. It doesn’t get dry or soggy when it’s dabao-ed home, unlike some other stalls. PLUS, there is fresh liver. The auntie’s friendly too and the queue doesn’t take long.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109919050302342272403/reviews
