TN Boey,5,"Good food, friendly staff, big portions and at a fair price! This restaurant provides a great deal for those who are looking to get their fill of mediterranian cuisine. Ordered 2 servings of their butter chicken burrito bowls, with extra protein, which came heaped with loads of fresh veggies and meat. On the side, greek ranch and a spicy sauce was also provided.

As an appetizer, we got the 5 pc of falafel with hummus, which was well balanced with flavour and piping hot.

Although this restaurant may be listed as a delivery spot, they have a decent sitting area on their second floor, accessible via a stairway.

Definitely drop by if you are hungry and in the area! They are currently running a dine in promo with eatigo, and you can get up to 50% off at selected dining times.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105375668338316247264/reviews

K K,5,"This restaurant-cafe's food speaks loud itself for its mouthwatering taste, generous portion size, healthy-balanced concept with less oil, less salt, & less chilli.
Amazing variety of options for vegetarians, vegans, eggetarians, & non-vegetarians too at cost-effective rates. Staff is very humble, polite, & takes your feedback very honestly. It has become a go-to-go place for me.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114072508112530511154/reviews
Diana Plent,4,"I've ordered multiple times via Foodpanda and Deliveroo, always leaving positive reviews. However, todayâ€™s order was a bit disappointing. While the delivery was 25 minutes faster than usual, the food arrived cold, and the portion of chicken shawarma was noticeably smaller than usual. I also found it odd that the item was marked as ""not available"" on Foodpanda but was still selectable on Deliverooâ€”perhaps due to low stock? I hope the quality and portion sizes remain consistent in the future.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114943205192358128403/reviews
