I have been there quite a number of times, and they are just SLOW. waiting time is super long, they have four counters, but not all are fully operational. Even if they are, you will still wonder why they are so slow. when I went there today, the security officer said the waiting time is 2 hours and suggest me to go try other branch...... I was speechless.",

I entered the same PIN, but she said it failed 3 times. Instead of guiding me through the process, she gave me an unfriendly expression, as if I didn’t understand it. As customer I didn’t appreciate her attitude, so I raised my voice that made other attention. Please ensure better customer service and treat customers with respect.",
