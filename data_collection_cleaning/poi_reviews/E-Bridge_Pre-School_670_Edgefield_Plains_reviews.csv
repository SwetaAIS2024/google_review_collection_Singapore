Vivian K,1,"Very Terrible service . Called to enquired regarding fees however was told to source it on website.
Tried to arrange for viewing and visit however was rejected and was infrom that they will only arrange for confirm registration.
How are we going to confirm when we don't see the environment, hygiene and their teaching method.
So far the Worst school I came across In punggol. Pushing everything away.
I don't expect excellent or exception service but they don't even meet the BASIC !",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108460529175275248387/reviews
Wanying Fu,1,"There are many mosquitoes in the weeds in front of the school. I get bitten every day. The wounds are red, swollen, hard and itchy, and it takes more than a week to heal. There are also many wild dogs gathered under the bridge leading to the bus station outside. They will attack people and bark very loudly, which is very scary. Wild dogs appear at playgrounds and school gates every day, making it very dangerous to pick up and drop off children‼ ️Today I also saw a child being chased by a wild dog. It’s very dangerous⚠️Children in kindergartens will also encounter wild dogs when playing outdoors at school. I don’t know how the school handles it. What if the wild dogs hurt the teachers or children? Why can't it be improved after so long? ? ?",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108920940231789656839/reviews
