      "text": "Mr Ang is a very patient teacher which is clear and concise with his delivery of concepts. Undoubtedly, Mr Ang is a very capable teacher that taught me to love Math more. Before he taught me, I used to think of Math as an obstacle and something that I would not want to study in future. However, he has made Math so much easier and digestible for me. With him as my teacher, my grades have improved significantly. I would definitely recommend him as a teacher.",

I personally could easily absorb what the lesson is about and apply the knowledge in the worksheets that she gives and the worksheets in school. She also provides notes to all her students and the content is concise and easy to understand. A wonderful tuition center indeed, helpful and effective.",

He always aims to explain concepts thoroughly, provide substantial practice and revision as well as respond  to studentsâ€™ queries outside of lessons. Above that he also keeps lessons as casual and fun as possible, and I enjoyed my time at Numberskill!",

The recorded lessons are also super helpful in ensuring that we do not miss out any lesson even when we cant make it for that day:)",

He covers a variety of practice questions in his bi-weekly 2-hour lessons. I can understand Maths concepts better under his tutelage. I still have some way to go in my Maths journey, but I am confident of making it a success with Mr Ang's help and with my own diligence.ðŸ˜„",
