      "text": "Great service from Sunny at Maybank Jurong Point! She was very helpful and proactive in suggesting a way for me to avoid a $15 service charge when withdrawing money. Instead of doing it over the counter, she advised me to use the ATM and then exchange the cash for smaller denominations inside. Really appreciate her patience and initiative—small gestures like this make a big difference. Thank you, Sunny!",

The staff member at the booth made me feel like I was being passed around unnecessarily, as he directed me to the front desk without explaining that the issue wasn’t within his expertise. However, the front desk staff were excellent, helpful, friendly, and very patient in assisting me.",

      "text": "I'm a mybank customer for the past 15yrs. All the counter staff are friendly,but on sat 13oct 2024 I done a transaction , I want to  closed my account for personal reason. When I reached the jurong point branch at around 12/12.30 pm . The front staff were busy helping the customer to do transaction. Since nobody in the front counter I did go to one of the cleaning lady, I did ask her nicely but she answer in a loud voice ask me to wait at the front counter since the staff was busy, I was in a bad mood that day but I still can control my anger. After finish doing my transaction ,I go and approached her. I talk to her nicely in a soft voice but she answer  in a loud voice, she said her tone is like that. And told me that it's my problem that ,that day I was in a bad mood. I told her next  time try to lower her tone when talk to customer. She keep on talking and don't let me talk. She was rude, I did not dishonor her as a cleaner as I'm also a cleaner at SP,but she should learn her manners when talking to the customer. I wanna complain to one of the staff there but I dont want her to be more aggresive since it sat and there alot of customer that day. I hope the manager can talk and educate her . Thank you",
