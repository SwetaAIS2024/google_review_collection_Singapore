Soke Ting Ng,5,"My husband and I are so very pleased that we found Tadika Xaris Medini for our daughter. Tadika Xaris Medini is a wonderful learning environment for children to learn as the Montessori method is a more natural way for them to learn. The activities are very broad, making the experience fun and educational as well. When you walk into Tadika Xaris Medini, can see that it's very open, it's inviting, and extremely interactive. The curriculm at Tadika Xaris is much more focused on the individual child. My daughter is excited to go to school and becoming more social and educated each day. The teachers are so warm and loving. I highly recommend Tadika Xaris Medini for anyone looking for the perfect place for your child to start pre-school!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116532736014964322436/reviews
