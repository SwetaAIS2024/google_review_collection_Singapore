Dhananjay Garg,5,"Sentosa Sensoryscape feels like walking through a dream built for the senses. The entire experience is calm, magical, and full of small surprises. It doesn’t feel like a regular walkway or a place you rush through—it actually makes you want to slow down and take everything in.

The structures around you are creatively designed, and you can sense a lot of thought went into combining nature with modern art and technology. At night, the entire area lights up with colors, patterns, and sounds that react to your movement, which makes the walk even more exciting. It’s like the environment is responding to you, guiding you forward gently.

There’s also this peaceful feeling throughout the place. The plants, the light shows, and even the sounds work together to create something very relaxing and enjoyable. It’s a great place to go with friends or family, or even just on your own if you need a break from the usual busy city life.

Overall, Sentosa Sensoryscape is more than just a park or installation. It’s a space designed to help you reconnect with your surroundings and feel present. It reminded me of how art and nature can come together to create something really memorable.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105192542383225533490/reviews
Veronica Ika,5,"Sensoryscape features six sensory gardens, each offering a different perspective of the exhibits. Admission is free, but to fully experience Symphony Streams and Scented Sphere, you’ll need to install the ImagiNite app and scan the QR code.

Don’t miss the breathtaking views from Lookout Loop, the immersive light story show at Tactile Trellis, and the mesmerizing mist show at Palate Playground. It’s a fantastic place to bring kids—or to simply let your inner child run free!

There are staircases in Glow Garden if you need to rest your legs.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107431808285133248063/reviews

Vincent Lee,4,"A fairly new and currently free attraction featuring a multisensory walkway stretching between Beach and Imbiah stations.

There are various interactive zones, with two with augmented reality that can be experienced via an app ImagiNite.

Sentosa provides free wifi and so, visitor can install the app without using their own cell data and be guided through the various installations by the app.

The upper deck was closed due to weather on our visit and so, we did not get to explore the whole area.

Consider visiting after sunset for a more vibrant AR experience along with the light installation.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111417065994620089449/reviews
karthick s,5,"A lovely spot to enjoy the evening! The area is well-designed and offers great photo opportunities. The best part? It’s completely free! For the most picturesque experience, visit just after sunset when the lights turn on—the golden hour glow adds a magical touch",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108392026626486317573/reviews
