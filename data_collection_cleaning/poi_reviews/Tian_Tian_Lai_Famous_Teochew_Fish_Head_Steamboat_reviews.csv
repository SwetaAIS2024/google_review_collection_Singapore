Di Soong Loh,1,"Messed up place what’s the point of a reservation here? Made a 7:00pm reservation. Arrived early at 6:30pm big mistake thinking that would help. After waiting over TWO HOURS, we left without ever seeing a single dish. Meanwhile, walk-in guests (yes, without reservations!) were happily eating while we sat there invisible.

Tried to get the attention of the staff, which felt like chasing unicorns. When we finally spoke to someone who seemed remotely in charge, we were told brace yourself that there were still 7 tables ahead of us. So much for the idea of reservations meaning anything.

The staff had the energy of people being forced to be there. Approachable? Not unless you enjoy being ignored. The entire system was a masterclass in how NOT to run a restaurant.

If you’re into hunger games-style dining where the only thing you’re served is disappointment, this place is for you. Otherwise, save your time, your appetite, and your dignity go literally anywhere else.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101870707263222276275/reviews
ET Home,3,The rest of the dishes other than Fish head steamboat are flavorful with wok hey stir fry taste. Kids friendly and I would say may not be the best but yet worth a try for people living nearby in Bedok.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102578398032035454582/reviews
Wahbiang Joe,5,Fast serving. Good generous portion for the small steamboat. Nice place to chill out and dine on the roof top with lots of parking spot. Reasonable pricing for the food.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100542623735974431207/reviews
TAN BN,2,"Came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We were the only customer. Ordered 3 dishes n they were pretty alright. Hot plate tofu was what I thought to be the best dish, but to my horror when I was finishing the dish, I found the eggs to be stained with black stuff. Asked the server what was that n she answered probably is the soot formed when heating up the hot plate. Is that supposed to be normal?",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112490905826124027599/reviews
