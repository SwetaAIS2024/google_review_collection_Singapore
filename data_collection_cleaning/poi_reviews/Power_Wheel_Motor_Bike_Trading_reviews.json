Didn't even have a booking, I was just given their name by a good friend of mine. I showed up at 4:30pm and it was all done and dusted in about an hour. They even put new terminals on the battery connections for free. They also welded a cracked bracket on my top box. I was so impressed as it saved me a lot of money... I will definitely go back.",
