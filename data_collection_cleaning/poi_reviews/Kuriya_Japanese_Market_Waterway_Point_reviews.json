      "text": "First came to this restaurant together with my wife since last year. I always like to order their Curry Udon with beef, chicken or prawn, and some others like fried ebi, miso soup and chawanmushi, my wife like their Unagi Don. Initially I like their curry, which is mid thickness. But few months ago, the curry became very watery especially if I come around 8.30pm, which only mean this Waterway Point branch chef, doesn't care about the quality at all.\n\nNow the last 3 visits, I have stopped ordering my favorite Curry Udon and opt for other food. Then about our another favorite, Jumbo Ebi Fry, 2 times it does not serve with the sauce that advertised in their menu picture (see attachment pics) and the staffs don't bother to inform unless I went back to the counter ask the staffs, and all they can say \"oh today don't have\".\n\nMe and my wife is getting more and more unsatisfactory with this Kuriya Japanese Market Waterway Point branch on the food and service quality. Talk to lead staff auntie about food quality, she's seem like doesn't bother as like not to her concern, probably she already tired of customers complaint.",

      "text": "I love visiting Kuriya. It's one of my favourite eateries in Waterway Point. The staff is always so warm and friendly. Food is great and has good prices.\n\nOne particularly memorable encounter was during christmas where we ordered a few bundles and a special strawberry log cake weeks beforehand. During collection day, i went early, even before they opened. But the staff (manager?), immediately served me even when he was still setting up the tables.\n\nOnce he saw my invoice, he recognised it strsight away and apologized by saying when he entered the system the day before, he realised that the log cake delivery to the branch had a different delivery time slot than the other bundles.\n\nWhen i mentioned that my logcake was for a birthday celebration in the morning and cant wait for the afternoon, he offered to pay for another log cake from another different brand/stall, as a gift to us out of his own accord.\n\nThat was super impressive and sincere. I didnt bear to take his offer. In the end, he gave us free drinks and got the log cake hand delivered to us the moment he recieved it.\n\nThis is top level service recovery that is rare in singapore. Kudos to how train your staff üëèüèª üëç üòÄ",
