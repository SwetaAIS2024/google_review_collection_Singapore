Joaye Ong,5,"Service is great as I can text and enquire about price & stocks available. The customer service even took the time to also explain the promotion for each product that I asked. Environment is clean and they are doing grooming too. Looking at the dogs there, itâ€™s obvious they are doing a great job.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116751747736116541129/reviews

Rafael Hermes,2,"Terrible experience on the hotel and grooming. We left our pom with them and she came back with no fur.
