Gator,4,"This new tea cafe keeps things simple: fast service, no pretension, and decent quality for the price. While it won‚Äôt wow serious tea connoisseurs, it‚Äôs a practical pitstop for casual drinks.

The Standout:
üçµ Oolong Tea ‚Äì Fragrant and well-brewed (the missus approved!)
‚òÄÔ∏è Outdoor Seating ‚Äì Pleasant for people-watching on nice days

The Average:
‚òï Coffee ‚Äì Forgettable. Stick to tea here.

The Vibe:
‚úì Efficient ‚Äì Order-at-counter style, good for quick breaks
‚úì Unfussy ‚Äì No elaborate decor, just basic tables and chairs",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
jyl,5,"I tried the Strawberry Mochi drink here, it‚Äôs so good! The strawberry yogurt part is creamy and just the right amount of sweet, that‚Äôs super refreshing. But the best part? The mochi! Those little chewy pieces mixed in make every sip fun and satisfying. It‚Äôs like a dessert and a drink in one, and the combo just works.
They‚Äôve got these cool camping chairs and tables outside, so you can just kick back, relax, and enjoy your drink like you‚Äôre on a mini getaway. Super chill spot for hanging out , 10/10 would recommend!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110884459446579641453/reviews
Tang Jie Jie,5,"Lovely ambience with a charming traditional Chinese interior‚Äîperfect spot for tea and desserts. Tried the Jasmine Coffee, Ceylon Black Milk Tea, snow ice, and black sesame walnut dessert. Everything was well-balanced and not overly sweet. A great place to unwind after a meal. Will definitely return to try more!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108206966132141010839/reviews
xy,5,"Charkuu at Eco Botanic has a cozy, MUJI-inspired vibe. The drinks and desserts are delicious with the right balance of sweetness. I loved the Spring Jasmine tea the most! Definitely worth a visit!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102806183583302740365/reviews
Ryson Gan,5,"Craving for milk tea and dessert in the same time? This is the best place to go!

My favourite roasted oolong milk tea bingsu in JB.

Best part is the bingsu last for very long in room temperature. Usually ordered bingsu in other stores have to finish it in a short period of time. At this shop you can slowly enjoy it and chilling with your loved one.

Strongly recommended bingsu!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104956906072792450269/reviews
