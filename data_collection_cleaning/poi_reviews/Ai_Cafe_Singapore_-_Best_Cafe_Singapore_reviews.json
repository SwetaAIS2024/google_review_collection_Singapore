But, it is not although I would say that it can be one of the cafes which you may visit for a decent meal.\nLocated along Horne Road, the owner is friendly and accomodating.\nThe menu served mostly Western fare with a \"out-of-the-blue\" inclusion of Asian dish.\nWe had Mushroom soup which tasted as if they made it using mushrooms and not from powder nor cream.\nThe fried crab cakes and french fries were good although we all know they were frozen.\nThe chicken chop was sizeable and tasty.\nThe star, for this dinner, was the waffles which we topped with Belgian Dark Chocolate and Osmanthus ice-cream. The waffles was crispy, on the outside and soft inside, with a whiff of vanilla fragrance to  the batter.\nUnfortunately, the lobster pow fun was a miss. We had a hard time getting the lobster flesh out of its shell. Also, the broth was not flavourful. Guess the broth was made when ordered and did not come from a labourous process of brewing the stock.\nThis cafe does not have the vibe of younger and newer ones in town. But if you are looking for a comfortable place, for gathering with old friends, where it's comfortable and can sit long, this is the place. Also good for family dinners as its menu can cater to many differing taste buds.",
