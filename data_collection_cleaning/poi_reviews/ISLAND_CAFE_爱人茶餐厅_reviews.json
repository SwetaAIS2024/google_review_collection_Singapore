      "text": "The cozy, retro-inspired vibe at ISLAND CAFE Áà±‰∫∫Ëå∂È§êÂéÖ is a nice change of pace from the usual busy kopitiams ‚Äî cleaner, more comfortable, and a bit more relaxed. The menu‚Äôs interesting and has a good selection. I dropped by for dinner and tried the Pig Skin Curry Rice Noodle Roll, which was decent, though it didn‚Äôt leave much of an impression. Service was fine, nothing to rave or complain about. The place had a few customers but wasn‚Äôt particularly busy. I‚Äôd put it down as a decent option if you‚Äôre nearby and want something casual without the usual hustle, but not a must-visit.",

The food is of high standard, and the interior is lovely decorated.\n\nThe coffee is a bit darker in color and quite thick compared to other local coffee. But Chenmian is so nice to help me adjust the milk level, smoothen it so nicely!",

      "text": "Nice little cafe. The curry chee chong fun was tasty, very lemak and full of various ingredients. The ginger nasi lemak was kinda unique, not quite as lemak but it paired very nicely with the belachan chilli and old school ikan bilis; the fried chicken cutlet was really nice (love the crispy batter) and came in generous portions. Last but not least, their iced kopi was pretty solid - definitely coming back for more. üòã",

They are so polite and well mannered. They are numerous decorations there that really enhanced the atmosphere. I truly enjoyed dining there. Will definitely go again to try everything else.",

Sauce to combined is great, chilli is separate, super spicy. They even have melon in their soup. Service was great too.",
