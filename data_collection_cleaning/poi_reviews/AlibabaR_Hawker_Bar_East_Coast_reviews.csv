jayden,4,"This place has been opened more than a decade ago and over the years it manage to keep it's customers coming in, even survive through the covid crisis which definitely tells about this place.
The hokkien mee has always been my favourite since so many years ago and the taste and standard is always the same. Nice broth with a strong taste of prawn heads, noodles are soft and not those doughy kind simmered in it's tasty prawn broth. The chilli is just nice, not too spicy, nice to go with the noodles. One of my favourite hokkien mee places to go, it's rich in its flavour and definitely has its own unique recipe.
The waitress selling the beers are also friendly, many varieties of beers from draft to bottled beers to cocktails etc, good place for a hangout. (4 stars for the hokkien mee and drinks stall)

However,  recently I tried the western stall beside the hokkien mee, the fries is ok though kind of pricey for it's portion of truffle, however what got me irritated was that when I ask for chilli or tomato sauce, the person just told me ""don't have, ran out of both"" which is ridiculous of how can you operate a western stall without the basic tomato or chilli sauce, what if I were to ordered a plain fries, does it means I will have to eat without any sauce? Any for goodness sake you could have told us before we order.  The truffle and cheese also wasnt mixed property, it's just chunks of it on the top layer of the fries with middle and bottom just purely plain fries(*2 stars for the attitude and service*)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews

Devane Sharma,5,"Tried a burger from the burger stall, kebabs from the Turkish one, and their craft beers. All were great and they have a nice selection of craft beers- the staff are great and happy to give recommendations for the beers. This place is set up like a food court and is a relatively cheap option in the otherwise pricey East Coast dining belt.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110960017867590746601/reviews
chu xuan,4,"Good vibes and good food! 4.5/5 stars!

The hokkien mee is okok. Wet kind and the sauce was not bad. We shared $8 for 2 pax.

The pizza stall sells REALLY GOOD sourdough truffle pizza for $16! Omg cheesy and rich and hot. They gave so much truffles I got sick of it towards the end!

Place also has huuuge selection of craft beers! My red by Petrus (fruity beer) for $14++ was so expensive but tastyyyy. ""Like wine and beer had sex and made a sweet baby"" yeah tastes damn classy.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900991350615107188/reviews
Jeffrey Cecilio A. Araña,5,"Hence Busog! Sarap! Ubos!

If you're looking for a winning dinner experience, Pete's is the place to be! Their skewers of grilled chicken are cooked to perfection, juicy and flavorful, and paired beautifully with a fresh and vibrant salad. To top it off, a cold Paulaner beer is the perfect complement to the meal. The atmosphere is another highlight—on a Thursday dinner time, the crowd is all professional, creating a lively yet relaxed vibe. Pete's truly nails it with great food, quality drinks, and an inviting ambiance. Highly recommended!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105439833466567962925/reviews
