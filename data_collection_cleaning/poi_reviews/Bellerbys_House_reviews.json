      "text": "It's a great gem find! Nestled in back of Dempsey,  very near to the museum of ice cream.\n\nNice cosy place.  Nearby have pilates, dance studio for children.  A few seats outside.  Would have wanted a seat outdoor but were all occupied.  It's simple but nice place.\n\nThere's car park space and also clean nice toilets nearby.  There's also shuttle bus to this place.\n\nIt's a great find.  Didn't have a Chance to have coffee this time but will try at my return! Had tea.\n\nLimited food choices,  so don't think would be a choice for me for lunch, more for a coffee,  snack,  break time place.\n\nPrice wise,  definitely not a coffee shop range but would say it's reasonable for the location.",

Ordered the kaya toast and muesli this time. The bread was toasty and there was a good even spread of kaya and butter throughout the bread.\n\nThis muesli was cold but good as well. I like that you can customize the toppings to your muesli.\n\nOverall, a very nice chill place to come to!",

From accommodating me and my baby with warmth and kindness to serving up delicious food and drinks, every visit here has been a delight. The prices are reasonable, especially given its prime location in Dempsey. The serene atmosphere, surrounded by boutique gyms, adds to the charm. Plus, the convenience of a shuttle bus stop right outside makes it even more appealing. Highly recommend this gem of a café!",
