This is unacceptable and very rude...the staff in the one I showed in the picture\n1 Jan 2025\nAround 6:40pm",

Informing us the night's price for the seafood, since the price is per kg and changes every day. Food was not so special, just that the crab was big and filled us up really well. Total came up to be $196 for 2 pieces of 800g of crab ($136), soup, sambal kangkong $8, 6 pieces of mantou, 2 bowls of plain white rice ... one canned drink, jasmine chinese tea and coffee.",

Salted egg yolk sotong is nice, so is the butter prawn. Chili crab needless to say ! And sour sop drink which I rarely see anywhere serving üòç Will be back for more seafoooood üíì",

All the dishes are delicious and homemade style, not overly oily/ salty. The must-try dish is the grilled sotong. It's not listed on the menu, you need to ask for it. The sambal chilli served with the grilled sotong elevates the slightly charred taste to another level.",
