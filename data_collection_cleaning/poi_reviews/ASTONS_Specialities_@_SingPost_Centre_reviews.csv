Hiang Ar,4,"The fiery chicken is adequately spicy and tender. The herb grilled fish is well grilled at the edges and tender on the inside. It can be a bit dry. The herb gravy has no taste, the texture is similar mushroom soup. The addition of BBQ sauce to the baked beans at Astons is indeed a thoughtful touchâ€”it adds a rich, smoky-sweet flavor that elevates whatâ€™s usually a simple side dish. The baked potato, potato wedges and corn were all tasty too.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101185220797498251612/reviews
Ars 3276,4,"Chicken remains good as always.
Fresh thick juicy...shiok...

However the fish...tis time round was dry and hard. Not nice at all. I know because this is the only dish i'm using having besides the steak.
Bad ðŸ‘Ž for the fish.

The rest is good.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114029124935079806014/reviews
Piriyanga Simon,2,"Sadly to say the quality of food is horrible ! The side dishes  Mac and cheese & baked potato that I use to eat when I was young now taste super horrible !
So upsetting the standard and consistency isnt there .

Chicken has been re fried that can be seen clearly
The only food that is consistent is the chargrilled chicken",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115511008326025392340/reviews
Jesline Chong,5,"Although I used Great Eastern Birthday voucher, the food did not turn out to be awful. On top of that, the portion was generous. Cos I ever ate at Swenson many years ago which my set was free and the food was not nice at all hence I always wondered is it free means they just anyhow cook? I am super particular on fish but todayâ€™s fish is an awe for me. Keep it up.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114123236998613107997/reviews
