      "text": "Dr Lim was recommended by a PD friend of mine and I'm so glad to have been referred to him! He is now our preferred PD for all 3 kids. His accurate diagnosis, clear explanations and heart for the children and caregivers is very evident. I love that he also takes the time to explain the trajectory the illness is likely to take and what timelines to keep in mind so I can manage my own anxiety and know what to look out for the next time.\n\nI will always remember him as the PD who gently told me we need to send my baby to the hospital in an ambulance and whose diagnosis was spot on. I was a mess but his calmness & quiet confidence helped me feel assured and well supported. Baby ended up being warded for a week but seeing you first was the best call we made. Thank you Dr Lim!! Can't thank you enough!",

The online booking system is quite convenient, but it might be better not to repeatedly send messages about late charges, as parents with sick children are already under a lot of stress.",

      "text": "It was my first time going to Thomson paeds centre at JEM. Came quite early but was told waiting time is 3 hours. It was my mistake for not checking the queue status. Hence I went back home to wait.  Received a text to make my way and once I reached, i was called in. Dr Lim was a very nice and friendly doctor. My son normally tends to cry during Dr visit. But Dr Lim knows how to make a child calm down and feel comfortable. Really glad I met Dr lim, he really assess my son properly and gave me advice on what to monitor. Some GP tends to rush the consultation but Dr Lim really listen to your worries and advice you accordingly. Gave my son a tidbits afterward. Thank you so much, I have found a permanent paeds Dr for my son. Also, the nurses are very friendly too. Thank you (:  god bless you all.",

I would say Dr Lim is the most patient and caring doctor that I ever met. His consultation always gave me assurance in my daughter condition and how long it took for her to recover.\n\nHope to see more of such good doctors around in Singapore. Only downside is the queue over at the clinic due to popularity of the doctor.",
