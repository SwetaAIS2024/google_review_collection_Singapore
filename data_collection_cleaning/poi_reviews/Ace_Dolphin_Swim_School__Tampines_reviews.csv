Nur Azieyan Rosli,5,"I enrolled my children into Ace Dolphin swim school about a month ago after withdrawing from their previous school. They went for a trial class under Coach Gary, and they enjoyed the class so much that they told me to enrol them straightaway.
The admin was really nice and patient when I enquired about Ace Dolphin swim school. The process of signing up for trial class and enrolling my children into Ace Dolphin was seamless.
My children always have a great time during their class with Coach Gary. My kids said that Coach Gary is a fun and nice coach. Coach Gary is also good at building rapport with children that my kids were sold on attending Coach Gary’s class after their trial lesson. They are always looking forward to their swimming lessons. I’m glad that my kids are enjoying their class. Thank you Coach Gary!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103215853314235138140/reviews
Nur Faezah,5,"My 7 year old daughter joined Ace Dolphin early 2024 after being with Happy Fish for 4 years. Within the same year, Coach Gary recommended her to go for swimming test Bronze level, something we waited very long for previously. My daughter can be reserved and quiet but Coach Gary managed to make her feel safe with his kind personality and calm demeanour. He is good with children and caring towards them. This shows when he teaches them. My daughter enjoys going to swimming class. Thank you Coach Gary!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109380700748756237568/reviews
Chen Yinghui,5,"My kids caleb and Caleigh really like coach Gary. He is nice and fun to the kids and his teachings are effective too. Initially my kids are scared of swimming if they cannot reach the floor, now they are independent and love swimming. My kids refuse to be taught by other coaches now but I am glad we found coach Gary and will stay with Ace Dolphins with coach Gary.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101305660540119132806/reviews
Michell Chong,5,"Coach Gary is a very patience and funny coach (quoted by my son). He is also very good at handling young kids, without hard approach. He will also emphasise on right swimming strokes and Aidan able to learnt somersault in Bronze within 3 lessons! Coach Gary also very flexible, for any make up lesson etc.

Thank you Coach Gary!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111997915179260344774/reviews
Angel Huang,5,"Coach Gary does an excellent job in teaching the kids. I can see progress in my son's swimming skill, even though we have missed quite a few lessons. There is also no more water anxiety but more confidence. Thanks a lot Coach Gary!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117327438095869853442/reviews
