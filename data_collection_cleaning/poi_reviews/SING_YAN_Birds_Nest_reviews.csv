Belle Akx,5,"I am beyond impressed with the quality and attention to detail they deliver. From the moment the package arrived, I was struck by the elegance of the packaging.

The taste of the bird‚Äôs nest is exceptional, embodying the delicate preparation and nutritional focus Sing Yan promises.

Their customer service is equally remarkable‚Äîresponsive, attentive, and clearly dedicated to ensuring an excellent experience for their clients. Delivery was prompt and seamless, further elevating my satisfaction with the brand.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111232256872287437465/reviews
Yu Shan Tay,5,"First time trying out Singyan, other than the vacuum packs, i bought 3 other cooked flavours, rose, golden osmanthus and wild ginseng. Ivy (from singyan) contacted me to inform me about the delivery, and also when there was slight delay in the delivery due to rain. She is also very nice to advise me which flavour is better/nicer to eat warm and which for chill as i cant possibly consume all flavours in one day. Very impressed with their service especially when i buy through a groupbuy.

Also can see from the photos, each of their birdnest serving is very generous. Each flavours are also very nice and unique. Would definitely recommend others to give it a try!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101676929124440096985/reviews

Katherine Tan,5,"The delivery was quick, and the bird's nest came in a ceramic bowl with a spoon, making it incredibly easy and convenient to consume. The texture of the bird's nest is wonderfully smooth, and the red dates add a delightful savory flavor. My son loves it too! It's the perfect gift for moms who are pregnant or have recently given birth!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103710028027607703750/reviews
Rachael Lam,5,"I‚Äôve ordered the S$86 Promo Bundle bird next to try last Saturday morning and it arrived before¬†3pm¬†the same dayüëçüèº The smart boiler that comes with the bundle is good¬†and¬†useful.  The bird nest though only 3gm, was pretty thick and makes good portion¬†for¬†one¬†pax.  The texture of the bird nest  was smooth and soothing too.  I will order more.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100189719374906003001/reviews
