Jeremy Nguee,5,"Absolutely delicious. Love it that their platters come with grilled broccoli. So indulgent , I can’t believe it’s healthier too.

The place is super chic, clean and no grease smell. The food is tops and the sodas are not sweet either. I usually order online but visiting the outlet is certainly worth the trek if you’re in the area.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116648536487424381113/reviews
Leonard Tan,5,"Delicious Vegan Fast Food That Hits the Spot!
Just had a fantastic lunch at VeganBurg! Whoever said that vegetarian/vegan food is boring should come here!

Ordered the ""Chilli Krab"" and it was absolutely juicy, delicious and packed with flavor. The Chilli crab sauce was also spot on tasty!

The service was also quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was casual and welcoming. It's a great spot for a quick and satisfying meal, whether you're vegan or just looking to try something different. I'll definitely be back to explore more of their menu! Highly recommend!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104840712622734034993/reviews
Pranati Rajagopal,4,"Glad to see the space and menu revamped since my last visit many years ago! I had the seasonal special Lemak Burger meal and it was amazing! The tempeh-tofu patty was so tender. The sauce was gingery and umami. And the cucumbers were refreshing. The tempeh chips were great too! Price is a little steep but if you’re a student, the student meal is great! Also tried the new tofu-brócoli patty",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107696167670271536002/reviews
Vidya Mohan,4,"Food - Was delicious & was ready quickly. Very flavoursome even though vegan. All the sauces on the burgers were very good. Only broccoli was a bit bland. I would say price is a little steep. But given that vegan patties are really expensive in the supermarket, guess can’t complain.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107574834363047306690/reviews
Rufat Rassulov,5,"One of my favorite vegan eateries in the world! Their atmosphere is so unique, the branding is on point! The burgers are super yummy too, with a giant selection of classic and local flavors. Would love to see some vegan desserts tho!!
