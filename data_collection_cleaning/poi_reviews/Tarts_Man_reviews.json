The wrap is soft and easy to eat, my older parents was also able to eat the taco wraps, the size is just nice to bite. The combination of sauces and seasoning also brings out the flavours and isn't over powering.",

It served as appetizers before out main food arrives. The staff too were friendly and recommended us the popular choice.",

      "text": "I recently tried the cheeseburger spring roll dish, and I was extremely disappointed. Not only was it overpriced, but the taste was far from what I expected. The flavors were bland, and the texture was off, definitely not worth the money.\n\nTo make matters worse, when I brought my concerns to the staff, their response was simply “ok and sorry.” No effort was made to address the issue or offer a solution. For the price they charge, I expected much better quality and maybe better customer service. Unfortunately, I won't be buying from their stall anymore until improvements are made, and I wouldn’t recommend this dish to anyone.",

Among the food stalls, I find this one rather exquisite and tasty, and goes very well with a glass of Prosecco, while admiring the sunset the planes taking off just a stone’s throw away.",
