Hrmgr,4,"Tried the Bak Chor Mee here and amongst the many stalls selling similar dish, this stall is closer to the dish we knew. The seasoning had strong black vinegar taste with livers, minced pork, pork slices, pork balls and black mushrooms. Soup was also tasteful as well. For just $4, considered worth it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews

Karen Cheng,5,"Just want to try from a new stall and it exceeds my expectations. Taste wise on par or even exceeds some other popular ones. Value.
Last but not least friendly vendor. Many stalls lost my biz perpetually due to their bad attitude.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109746695433014478106/reviews
