Min HL,4,"pretty fast getting seats. there was a long queue during lunch which moves quickly

got 3 items and got them in this sequence: laksa first, popiah then the nasi lemak last. all within 10 minutes, as per stated by them 10-15 minutes during lunch time.

Enjoyed the nasi lemak, anchovies were really crispy and the rice has a nice fragrance

popiah - the ends had quite abit sugar in them, first taste was the sugar after biting in, the middle pieces were okay",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103965869018673563240/reviews
just Wai,5,"I do not know about the other that give low stars because I come at the none busy period, 4pm for their popiah.
I bought the prawn filling popiah at 3.30. Portion is big, is worthy if you want healthy snack. Their popiah is healthy yet nice, crunchy and crispy veg and ingredient( that is the closest texture i can describe) Is a must try to me.
Staff is fast to me too, popiah is fresh. Kopi is classic kopi.
Atmosphere is great too
Will be back for more.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113857140644341643606/reviews
Joanne Cheng,5,"Quite fast and easy to find seat, but usually will have long queue during meal time. We manage to get seat. The mee siam was nice and served hot. I ordered the mee siam special which have extra ingredients. The nasi lemak goes well with the chilli. The portion of the food is a bit too much for me so was super full. The laksa was so so and I still prefer the mee siam. The popian was normal and still not so bad. Overall this outlet food is served hot and we like it.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110408957347137900620/reviews
Haruka184,2,Curry chicken cutlet was extremely salty even without the curry gravy on top. They gave me nasi lemak rice bec normal rice is sold out even though it is only 7pm dinner crowd. Laksa egg noodle is literally maggie mee with clam. I wish they give the traditional cockles instead. The only thing nice is the popiah. We had to clear our own tray but the table is dirty and seat is oily.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112952189898086261454/reviews
Whispering Lilies,1,"Probably the WORST nasi lemak we had, ever! ðŸ˜«
Everything was served COLD and rice was totally blandâ€¦ need to drop the â€˜Lemakâ€™ in the dish description. Rice was also not thoroughly cooked, the first 2 spoonful felt like eating sand..
No hot drinks served even before 8.30pm which was a major turn off.

Standard dropped tremendously since the last time we stepped into Qiji.
Hope this is a one-off bad experience but after seeing other reviews, it seems that this outlet definitely need to step up a little.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103692882547505074134/reviews
