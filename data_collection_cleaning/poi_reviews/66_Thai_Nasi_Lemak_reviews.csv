dixon fong,5,"Superb Nasi Lemak nestled in the corner of AMK industrial estate!

Moo-ping is definitely a standout, super tender meat.

Blue pea rice is fragrant and the egg perfectly cooked.

Will definitely return again!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107277830612375832120/reviews
