Mohamed Nazri Yusop,1,I hate to give one star reviews but the Principal and teachers last year were simply not good enough. My son couldn't even read effectively in his one year there. He missed a performance and the teacher didn't even call us to ask where he is. My wife pulled him out of the class and we did homeschooling and Alhamdulillah he can start to read now. A wasted year.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116773209907085511490/reviews
JamieLah MoHamEd,1,"Sent our kids in this school. Came back with dried up poop in their pants. Told the teacher about it, their remark was they dont give them lunch at school! Subhana Allah, not only were they lazy to change their diapers they dont even bothered to give them a proper meal.

Send them at tour own risk. Both principal and teachers are those cant be bothered .",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104852805083629279334/reviews
