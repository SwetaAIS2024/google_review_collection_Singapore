The younger lady was polite and attentive. It was hard to get any attention. Especially an older lady wand she didn’t bother to provide us with an additional side plate we asked for.\n\nThe restaurant was really warm too we had to fan ourselves constantly to keep cool.",

      "text": "I should have ordered the mushroom pasta. I tried some from my partner, and that pasta tasted delicious. The mushrooms were cooked and seasoned perfectly as well. The shish meat in my Aleppo Pesto pasta dish was great, but the pasta itself was not great. The Hummus and roti is amazing, we devoured it all. Another friend ordered the fish and chips, and we were pleasantly surprised at how massive it was.\n\nThe service was alright, I felt like some servers were purposely looking away from our table when we had our hand raised so that they didn't have to serve us. My friend had to approach one of them to ask for service. Not all of them, a couple of them were very nice.\n\nThe atmosphere was quite nice.",

      "text": "A Hidden Gem with Stunning Views and Delicious Food!\n\nSumac at Temasek Club is truly a hidden gem nestled at one of the highest points in Singapore. From the moment you step in, you’re greeted by a breathtaking view of the lush greenery of the nature reserve. It’s a serene escape from the city’s hustle and bustle, and the warm, inviting ambience makes it the perfect spot for a relaxing meal.\n\nThe food? Absolutely lip-smacking! The menu is a delightful fusion of East meets West, offering a unique combination of flavors that will leave your taste buds dancing with joy. We ordered seafood hor fun, pasta with kebabs (can’t recall the name of the dish), meat kebab platter and some crab dish. Every dish was crafted with care, and the portions were incredibly generous—such a refreshing change from the smaller servings you often find in other restaurants in Singapore. You’ll leave Sumac not just satisfied but truly full and happy.\n\nThe service is nice too, and the overall experience feels like a well-kept secret waiting to be discovered. Whether you’re here for a casual meal or a special occasion, Sumac delivers on all fronts. It’s a must-visit for anyone looking for great food, stunning views, and a cozy atmosphere. Highly recommended!",
