Barbette Strauss,5,"Our second time eating Thai food from this food stall because we liked the service.  The staff was very nice to try to accommodate to our request for less oil, low salt & low sugar food.  We will be back to try other dishes recommended by the staff.  Highly recommended!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116995110127835257886/reviews
Venny Juliana,5,"One thai food stall inside a food court at tampines north.

Ordered the tom yum fried rice as first time, turns out very nice, flavorful and shiok.

There are some hidden fishball under the mount of fried rice, and the squid is soft but still have some chewiness.

The thai chilli sauce that i took was quite spicy and lemongrass fragrance if im not wrong.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114070569380434404874/reviews

Phyllis Ng,3,Had the tom yum and the food tasted nice but itâ€™s pretty pricey for a coffeeshop. The portion was also super small as can be seen from photo.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110618123912311350759/reviews
Nivlac,1,"This stall gives Thai food a bad name. The Thai basil meat was neither tasty nor spicy. The omelette egg does not have any Thai taste at all.

The tom yum soup tasted more like ginger soup, the two prawns inside were mushy, the soup was not spicy and it came with crab stick and fish balls.

The pad Thai was terrible. Tasteless and also came with crab stick.

It is unfortunate, but please avoid ordering delivery from here as there is a high chance of disappointment. It was so bad, my wife and I had to eat ice cream to lift our moods. It is so bad that it gave me as much trauma as Venom gave to Spider-Man.

Hopefully they change recipe, but until then, steer clear friends.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108617131181214278824/reviews
