N T,3,"Good:
Dr William Yip is experienced and professional. That is why we go to this clinic. The ultrasound professional is good and explains things well. They tend to be pretty flexible with appointments - but the trade off is a busy waiting room with lots of kids and waiting.

Bad:
The front desk staff is a bit brusk and seems disorganized.

Ugly:
The nutritionist adds no value. One doesn’t need to pay $1K for sometime to tell them to eat vegetables and low fat foods…",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116736755047837525318/reviews
Y Liu,1,"Staff called Rita SUPER rude. Called in to enquire whether Dr Ngiam do standby for newborn, she asked for my Gynae name but I think it’s not necessary at this point of time. She forced me to said who is my gynaecologist. After I told her, she told me they was not closed in relationship, so will not do standby. WOW!  I didn’t know paediatrician can choose which gynaecologist  to work with. Good luck  to whoever who choose to send their kids here.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112902320464165734594/reviews

Elizabeth Chen,1,"Doctors may be good but the clinic is so
Poorly managed. 2 hour wait time even with an appointment. Unacceptable especially at those
Prices. Will never go back",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105881281730727800964/reviews
