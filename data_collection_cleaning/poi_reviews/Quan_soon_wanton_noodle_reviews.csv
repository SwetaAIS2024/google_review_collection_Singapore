Freddy,5,"Superb shui jiao with lots meats and big prawn. Ate here since 2008s when I'm around the area. Till date, the noodles never fails. Yum Yum. Recommend! Medium size at $4 is reasonable.

Garry Lew Your Estate Advisory Realtor,4,"Visited 02/06/2024 cloudy Sunday morning. The following sharing are based on our unbiased personal opinion and experience

Ordered the $4 portion wanton noodle. Noodle was spring and chewy. Cooked almost to perfection. The black sauce and chilli compliment the noodle really well. The wanton was soft and ingredients was fresh and generous.

Just the old school type of breakfast to start off my day.

Gopi Bala,4,"I came across this stall today, and decided to give it a shot.

I ordered the $4 portion. At first glance, after the noodles were prepared, the noodles didn't look exciting.

However, after tossing and mixing the noodles, they appeared to look better.

The noodles were done just right and they had that springy chew when bitten into.

The sauce and chilli in the noodles were excellent. The char siew was nicely done, but perhaps it could have some fat on it.

The wantons were also of good quality. Service staff were polite and efficient.

Definitely worth another try when I am next in TGFC.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114775727475904526433/reviews
Ryan Fernandez,3,"Always see a long queue at this stall so I decided to try their Dry Prawn Noodles. Settled for a mid size bowl of mee pok @ $4.50.  Portion was decent.

The soup was pretty good however the taste of the noodles wasnâ€™t what I expected. I found the noodles pretty bland, I thought maybe not enough salt so added some soya sauce but still bland. The texture of the noodles was good though, springy and nice. Chili abit spicy but the pork lard, disappointingly chewy and not crispy. Overall I find the dish lacked the umph.

I guess probably their wanton noodles will be better. Will try and update.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106982280176042399585/reviews
Cello Febrian,4,"For $3 a plate, I seriously think is very value for $$$.

Taste actually not bad. I am not a fan of old sch char siew, But if u donâ€™t mind, itâ€™s really worth your stomach space.

Thereâ€™s this super popular wanton mee in pek Kio market at $3.50 per plate, super long queue. So, if this stall is also in pekio market, without any doubt, I will buy this to avoid the queue and yet feeling satisfied.

In fact, this stall is way better than the other 2 wanton mee stalls in pekio.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106655270297873073853/reviews
