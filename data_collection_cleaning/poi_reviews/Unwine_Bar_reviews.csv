Stephanie Loi-Watson,4,"Came here for lunch, there is a set lunch menu serving chicken mains (roasted or fried) and choice of 2 sides + choice of dipping sauce.

Generous serving of chicken and sides. They are also serving free flow cold brew green tea.

Overall good value for money and would recommend for a casual lunch if you are looking for a place to eat in IOI.

Post 2nd visit review: second time ordering fried chicken and both times inside of the chicken was red and looked unappetizing. Provided feedback to management the first time and they did not really action upon it apparently. I would suggest to avoid the fried chicken.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110443174175998708230/reviews
Bryan Tan,5,"New and clean bistro to dine in! Has comfortable ambience and unique fusion food that is perfect match with their plethora selection of wine!

Most commendable would be the mackerel fish cakes and pesto linguine.

Do give it a try!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112618895024196424877/reviews
Natasha Tan,5,"i recently visited this new wine bar near asia square and was quite impressed! the ambiance is quite cozy. i ordered the pesto pasta from their dinner menu (they also have a lunch special menu)  as well as the happy hour drinks. the pesto pasta is really rich in flavour and taste really good! the prosecco, champagne and wine for happy hour is also super worth!!! highly recommend visiting for the food and drinks!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104272281161789161651/reviews
Y. Aaron,5,Came here with a group of 3 for lunch. The  roast chicken breast was nice and tender. The fried chicken is a signature item on menu. The mash potato side dish is delicious too.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104741511344021521665/reviews
