Ivan Goh,5,"I have been bringing my wife to AcuFem Women's Specialist Services for over a decade, and I cannot recommend them highly enough. Dr. John Yam is a man of few words, but his actions speak volumes. Over the years, he has provided top-quality care, guiding us through two successful deliveries and completing our family. He is incredibly patient, always taking the time to address all our questions, and his empathy shines through in every interaction—he truly wears his heart on his sleeve.

That said, AcuFem can be quite packed during peak hours, so patience is required while the backlog clears. However, the nurses and assistants are always kind, professional, and ready to help, making the wait more manageable.

A special mention goes to Jackie, whose role in the clinic is often overlooked but absolutely crucial. She is the taskmaster behind the scenes, ensuring the clinic runs smoothly and efficiently. When you need an urgent blood test, clinical scan, or any other critical procedure, Jackie will move mountains to make it happen—left, right, and center—to ensure you receive the top-quality care you deserve.

Overall, I highly recommend AcuFem and will personally vouch for the exceptional level of care provided by Dr. Yam and his incredible team.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103181928351407267247/reviews
Christine Yeo,5,"Highly recommend Dr John Yam. Man of few words, but answer all of our questions patiently. He is very chill but very skilled ;) it is very easy to get through to him on questions through his nurses, and responses are quick.

I mainly see Dr Yam at the Sincere clinic but once I went to Acufem and the nurses there are very attentive and friendly as well.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108622199969111312416/reviews

Jina,1,"Nurses are pretty rude and despite I waited for like an hour, no apology but annoyed that I asked about number of patients in front of me.
Told me that my Cigna isn’t covering without checking properly.
Speaking out loud about my weight in front of room full of patients.

Please learn the basic manner for patients",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113230391686801829290/reviews
