Angela Ann,1,"If I can choose zero star for review, I would. PRC shop worker has really bad attitude. I have directed lazada delivery to have their shop as collection point. She asked me to check the pin number for collection in SMS. I told her I do not receive any sms from ninja van. She said she cannot pass the delivery to me in a rude manner.
As i checked, she snatched  my phone away and search. I was stunned and took it back. So I said why she has to be so rude.  She said in that case, do not send any delivery to the shop and said if I am not happy I can complain and yet refused to give me her name. Although it is not necessary as she is the only worker there. I was really stunned by her ill mannered behaviour .
It was not my first encounter with her bad attitude that I feel she needs to be told off by her employer. I  will never patronise that shop forever.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117215166846946435630/reviews
Tee Yee Yang,1,"This place does not accept parcels for ninjavan drop off, based on an interaction I had with a male staff on 25 Oct 2023.
That is not as per what is indicated on the ninjavan website. Please remove this store from the PUDO list!

The nearest PUDO point for ninjavan is at siren printing lab.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116718106070101622785/reviews

Charley,1,"There shouldn't even be a 1 star. The lady working there is extremely disrespectful and rude. Will mock locals who cannot speak her China language and all around unhelpful if you cannot speak Mandarin at all.

Don't bother supporting this local business. Owners don't go down to the stores anymore and just focus on expanding and hiring all these cbf with anybody that is not from China workers. Outlets are in punggol and 2 in jurong west",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104145877408345055732/reviews
フーデレック,1,"The most horrible shop staff i ever come across in the WORLD. And guess what? You got it right is from Cheena! Super bad attitude and rude, don’t know who is the owner, but such staff means owner also sama sama. First and last to use this collection point.
