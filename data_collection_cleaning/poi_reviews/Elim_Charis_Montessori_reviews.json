      "text": "I couldn't be happier with my daughter's experience at Elim Charis Montessori. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warmth and enthusiasm from the staff. The environment is bright, cheerful, and filled with stimulating activities that keep the children engaged and excited to learn.\n\nAll staff and teachers are very detailed, attentioned and taking care of children since day one. My daughter adapted really well (her first experience) in a very short timeframe thanks to the guidance and caring during the first days of her teachers and staff.\n\nAs a parent it gave me also a lot of calm and comfort the follow up provided by the teachers through their app so we knew on a daily basis how my daughter was doing and her adaptation and activities she carried out. Also teachers and staff were very responsive to our questions and queries on how she evolved.\n\nOverall, I wholeheartedly recommend Elim Charis Montessori to any parent looking for a nurturing and enriching early childhood education program. My daughter is now looking forward to going to school every day, and as a parent, that peace of mind is priceless.",
