Delicious food as always. Only gripe is the honey milk latte didn’t taste as expected, not milky not honeyed, just quite strong coffee! A staff helped to bring it for more milk and honey to be added, though still can’t really be tasted.\n\nThank you, will be back!",

She and her team were friendly, attentive, and helpful. We will definitely return for the wonderful service, which truly elevated the taste of the food and coffee for us diners. Thank you, Bernie and team!",

Shoutout especially to Bernie, who asked if we needed anything and made dining here a pleasant experience.\n\nThe truffle fries' portion were huge - we got a half portion and it fed the two of us well. They were still crunchy in the right way even when the fries got cold, which is a big plus. The stew wasn't too bad either; the calamari's texture was nice and easy to chew :)\n\nAnd finally the double chocolate blackout cake - it was HUGE. The portion is certainly generous; get this if you like chocolate cakes with lots of sponge.\n\nAll in all a good dining experience, will come again next time!",

Kacy was very thoughtful, she split the tomato bisque into 2 portions for our convenient sharing, without us having to request it.\n\nService by all staff was prompt, food was served quickly and was delicious. Compliments to the chef! Had the barramundi with risotto and East Coast exclusive Southern buttermilk fish burger. Barramundi risotto sauce/gravy was slightly spicy but quenched with Wild Berry cooler drink :)\n\nWarmly lit ambience with good use of cove lighting. We will be back!",
