Kael Yeh,1,"Ordered at 13:32. Order supposed to be done by 13:36 displayed in the app. However they don't seem to follow order numbers. Waited by the store just to see no. 706, 707 being picked up before I got mine (705) at 13:41. Yes it's a 5mins wait. Don't display (order ready by 13:36 if you can't adhere to. Poor service. Doesn't accept cash, meaning the elderly who do not have mobile payments services cannot buy their Coffee Coffee is not bad.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101304222860661686208/reviews
S. H.,1,"Went to get a coffee today and it’s my first time trying luckin coffee. Politely asked the counter how much the tiramisu latte costs, she curtly told me to order through the app and it’s also not available. How does it make sense a physical store doesn’t allow f2f purchase but insists on people ordering through an app? Anyway, I downloaded the app, finagled with it for a good five minutes where I have to navigate through a sea of pop-ups on their discount-collections if you do so-so and so, and then finally the 99cents offer popped up. I clicked on it, and it direct me to sign up. And having signed up, there is NO 99cents offer voucher etc in my account and there’s only a random 30% off. Also the UI of the app is just really information and pop up overload and I have never been so irritated trying to get a coffee. Starbucks, CBTL, literally any normal coffee place allows for a quick purchase of a much needed caffeine shot. Anyway, the curt service staff with the confusing app just makes the experience not worth it imo.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103223471750671596627/reviews
