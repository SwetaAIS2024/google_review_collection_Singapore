      "text": "Spacious and quiet environment that reminds me a lot of the traditional Chinese restaurant I used to enjoy when I was a kid. We tried the $48 dollars ala carte buffet ---  every dish was tasty, fresh and well-presented. Excellent, prompt and warm service from the waiters, in particular, the waiters name Ice and Obama. The place is a bit difficult to locate, probably due to closure of various entrances due to Covid. And yes, the serving is not as small as we thought, so one needs to be careful not to order too much, as takeaways is not allowed.",

In times of climate change, it might be advisable to either close all doors or switch of the ACs.\nOverall, good dinner experience. E&E",

Good pricing for zichar in a hotel poolside setting in the orchard area (10+ for veggie, 20+ for meats). Do note that the entire restaurant is not air conditioned, but there is ample fan and ventilation.",

The dishes are really worth it; set meal for 2 pax was of relatively big portion. Loved the ginger chicken and their seafood fried rice. Ingredients used were fresh and generous in each and every dish.",
