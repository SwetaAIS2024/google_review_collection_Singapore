Wendy Koh,1,Today I was at the bank. The queue dispenser was obscure. So I ask the policeman on guard duty. He just point with his eyes. He must be a very lethargic man. I think a robot will do a better job.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103511519917198340814/reviews

Chris Heng,1,"This is the worst bank I always come. Service is bad. 5counter only 1counter is doing service. Open at 11am. How can only 1 service person , the rest siting down just keep counting money. After been waiting for 15mins 5 of the service person still sitting with their head down. OMG",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105477211154719868865/reviews
K Jacelyn,1,Literally THE SLOWEST bank I ever encountered. I would have given it a zero star if there is an option. Came here to withdraw a fixed account and to open another account. There was no one at the information counter to advise which service ticket to request for. Waited more than an hour for my turn and only to be told that I actually needed two different tickets for the different services. WOW! Such inefficiency is almost unheard of in Sg banks. So never mind I will withdraw and close all my accounts instead. Choose this bank if you have plenty of time to wait and plenty of patience for inefficiency.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115558505114010013086/reviews
Anne M,4,"I'm impressed by the AETOS security guard who is able to handle basic walk-in queries and direct customer to right queue tickets. He's very helpful all the time from my observations.
Probably it's the bank's outdated SOP  that brings down impact the customer experience n hence lower the ratings.  E.g. Having to go down to Branch twice just for opening an account is too much a hassle.  Staff follow SOP and I can see they're multi taskings while attend to random queries from ""cut -in"" customers ( that's  unfair to customers waiting patiently at the hall ).  Staff are definitely not rude „ÄÇ
