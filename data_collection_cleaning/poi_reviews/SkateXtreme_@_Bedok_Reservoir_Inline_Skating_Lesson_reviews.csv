Alvin Foo,5,"I have been sending my 2 boys, age 6 and 10, for their roller blade class for the last 2 years. I must say, it has been a fantastic experience for the boys. The instructors were incredibly patient and understanding, catering to each childâ€™s individual skill level. They also knew how to keep the class entertaining, making it enjoyable for the children.

What impressed me the most was the structured approach of the class. Each session focused on picking up a specific skill, which helped my child progress and feel accomplished. The class design made it fun and exciting, and my child eagerly looked forward to each session.

Overall, I strongly recommend this roller blade class. The instructorsâ€™ patience and ability to cater to different skill levels, combined with the structured and enjoyable format, make it a wonderful experience for children.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116183391368252974411/reviews
