Adele,5,"Chanced upon the currently Christmas themed shop today. Owner Cindy was friendly and provided samples of her self-baked goodies. They serve drinks too, and there's currently a promo running where you get free biscotti with a drink purchase. I followed her on social media and received the free biscotti, and purchased the cake. Muslim friendly bakery too! Small business that's worth supporting.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101728410969830404892/reviews
V,5,My family loves the original almond biscotti and caramel butter cookies! Even the random bakes of the day like caramel bar and almond cream croissant are super good! Definitely worth the price and calories! This place is such a gem üòç,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101915772664776657584/reviews
Maria Christine Asuncion,5,"Quaint cafe specialising in biscotti. The owners are lovely, they even gave me free samples. The store is all decked for Christmas and has a lovely vibe.

Kathleen Lau,5,"Lovely bakery hidden in a CSC club!

Biscotti is goooood!!
They have a great variety of flavours and the nuts are very fresh.

Auntie is also very hospitable and even gave us free samples for other flavours.

Absolute gem!

They have samples and I got 2 cranberry and pistachio. It‚Äôs so good and I‚Äôm so scared that I‚Äôll eat this whole bottle in 1 sitting! Gonna order as gifts soon",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106392388372297151397/reviews
