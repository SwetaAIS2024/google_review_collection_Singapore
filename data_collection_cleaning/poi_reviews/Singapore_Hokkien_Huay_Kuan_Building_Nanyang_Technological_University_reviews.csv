Gabrielle Nadia Li Effendy,4,"The photo is of shhk signboard. Code choice: mostly in English, two advertisements almost completely in mandarin simplified Chinese. I can presume that is for the Chinese studies majors. One has a slightly more calligraphic font. The ads consist of recreational activities by the school clubs, career or academic advancement advice, and volunteering opportunities. They do not seem to be organised in any particular way.
