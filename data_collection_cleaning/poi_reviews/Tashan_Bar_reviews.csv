Mashel Gill,5,"Came here with my husband for their live band event and it was definitely the best decision! We were warmly greeted by the owner, Manjit Kaur, who is a sweetheart. The live band was awesome and the selection of songs was perfect. We ordered fish tikka, chicken tikka & seekh kebab, the food was super tasty and left us craving for more! Shared my experience with family & friends, and they can't wait to experience it themselves. Looking forward to the next trip! :))",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114578071177219359600/reviews
CT,5,"I’m not one to review restaurants, but this is a very ambient and atmospheric environment. The chicken tikka is a must try, and if you have any drinks you’re considering to buy, the staff will offer you a sample to try. The drink prices are also affordable especially given the prime location. This restaurant is definitely worth your visit.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104297531821830705191/reviews
Wilbert Ting,5,The food is great! They're actually very very reasonably priced. went there the other day with my buddies and got a bottle of Glenlivet 18 and fell in love with  the Lagavulin whiskey the bartenders let me try. Definitely a very underrated place. would 100% go back for their fresh naans.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118426442787054045609/reviews
