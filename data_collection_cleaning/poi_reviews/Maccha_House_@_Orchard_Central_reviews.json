      "text": "Went there for dinner, not very crowded. Looked forward to the food but it was such a disapppointment. The sukiyaki hotpot set was SO sweet like we knew its supposed to be sweet, but this was over the top like candy kind of sweet and no other savoury nice taste...\nIt was hard to eat it honestly.\nSince it was so sweet, i wanted some water to dilute it and explained to the staff but they said its chargable which i understand but im not drinking it i wanted to add in. Later, the staff came back after a while and said they can add water in the soup so they took my meal and added in thr kitchen. Still tasted bad but at least abit better.\nWe also ordered matcha brownie and honestly it was so small like miniature size, and worse for the price. tasted ok.\nDefinitely traumatised and will NOT come back.",

      "text": "I was looking for Don Don Donki in Orchard Central but stumbled upon this matcha place that also serves Japanese meals: Maccha House. Since I’d been craving authentic Japanese matcha ever since my trip to Japan, I decided to give it a try.\n\nI ordered their uji matcha tiramisu, which was amazing and came with complimentary tea. The only downside was the worn-down utensils and the overall interior—while unpretentious, it also felt a bit cheap for Singapore mall standard.",

It was not applied in the final bill, but was rectified after I informed the service staff.",

      "text": "Having tried their Kyoto stores I was excited to give Maccha house at Orchard road a shot.\n\nWe ordered the following:\nVanilla/ matcha soft serve;\nKyoto matcha tiramisu;\nMatcha brownie;\nIced matcha latte.\n\nThe matcha/vanilla soft serve is actually not bad and a good soft serve for on-the-go.\n\nTheir matcha tiramisu lacked the matcha punch that we were expecting and left us quite underwhelmed.\n\nThe matcha brownie is a definite no-order. The brownie was too dense, too fatty and the flavours did not match. The dish might have been theatrical, yet do not recommend ordering it.\n\nLast but not least, the iced matcha latte. The latte tasted of matcha sugar milk without it actually having the proper smoothness.\n\nI am unsure if this maccha house is unfiliated to the ones in Japan, yet in quality they are definitely not the same. (Nor can be compared)\n\nAs a matcha lover this left me underwhelmed and will not come again.",
