      "text": "My experience:\n- Mixed vegetable rice is pretty good (nice variety of dishes, and delicious) and affordable. They occasionally even experiment with new dishes!\n- Fishball noodles has good soup (used to be a bit too salty, but they have improved ever since) and nice flavour for its dry version, and is generous with their amount of noodles given:\n- Fried Kway Teow and Fried Prawn Noodles are tasty, especially when the person preparing it is the guy. Sometimes a lady prepares that and certain customers (including myself) tend to not like it, since she makes the fried prawn noodles a little too soupy, whereas the guy is able to stir fry it to a more dry and roasted extent.\n- Porridge is decent but slightly overpriced for what it offers.\n- The staff selling and serving drinks are always prompt and attentive.\n- The staff clearing tables are also attentive and efficient, which makes it a super clean and inviting environment to dine in.\n- The location of this coffeeshop makes it ideal for people watching since there's lots of traffic passing by all day and night.\n\nThis is actually one of my top favourite coffeeshops in the area.",
