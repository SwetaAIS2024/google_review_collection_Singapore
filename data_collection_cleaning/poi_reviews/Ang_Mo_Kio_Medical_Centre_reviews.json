      "text": "Arrived clinic at around 10am, standing in front of the receptionist to wait for registration and the staffs were just rude, ignoring me, just let me stand there for a few minutes. The clinic closed at 1230pm, but until 1215pm I still not managed to see the doctor. I have waited for two hours. During registration the staffs had never told me that I have to wait for such a long time because I saw inside the clinic there were less than ten patients, shouldn’t be that long probably? If expected there will be a long wait time, you should inform the patients. The patients were already feeling uncomfortable waiting for treatment and medicine, still need to wait for more than two hours which is ridiculous. Will never visit anymore.",

I felt even glad to have Dr Paul professional checks and advice.\nThis is one of the few clinics where patients are treated with much care and with mutual respect.\n\nUnlike some  other clinics, the nurse assistants can be rude just because of 'work pressure'.\n\nMy thanks & kudos to Ang Mo Kio Medical Centre team . ♡",

Not great if you are feeling ok but worse if you are already ill. Avoided going here unless I have to.",
