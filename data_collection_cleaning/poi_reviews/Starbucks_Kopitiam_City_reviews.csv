Stan Su,1,"Out of Jam. Service personnel doesn't care to inform their out of stock situation when serving, Doesn't apologize too. Just replace jam with butter and ""that's my job done"". Poor service attitude.

Pooh Bear,3,"It's my third time here so far so good. The staff are friendly. However, seats are limited although quite spacious.
****I visited during the off peak hours***.
Latest was visiting on 7th May place pretty dirty. And spotted stains on the floor, hair on the surrounding seats area and table with crumbs etc. So far, this is my first time come across so dirty Starbucks which newly opened. The staff really didn't clean up. :( I had spoken with the staff but they simply ignored üôÅ",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116708239884491660895/reviews

DR DAVY GOH,5,"A newly opened Starbucks.
Close to the mrt station and is opposite of Sengkang Grand Mall. Surprised to see this Starbucks outlet to be situated in a non-shopping mall area.
The layout of the store was well-designed. The seats were sufficient for the crowd.
There were wide range of merchandise available for purchase.
Staff was friend and very patient- since I took a long time to finalise my purchase.
Good dining experience in this store.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100178836333366849641/reviews
Vincent Loh,1,"20/12/2024 around 8.40pm
1. Stand at cashier and waited close to 5 minutes with no serving.
2. Order for 2 cups of venti mocha frappuccino. Cashier key in 3 cups. Display on cashier was faulty so I could not counter check my order.After marking payment via paywave I noticed the mistake and informed the cashier. Told me to wait cos she not in-charge of the cashier so cannot do the refund. I agreed to wait and she also did not inform me of the wait time.
3. After my cups of order was done. The one in-charge of the cashier still have not turn up. Told me to wait a while.
4. After waiting close to 10 minutes after collecting my drinks. The cashier that mess up my order came and told me the in-change would not be back so early as went for prayer.
5. Took my 2 cups of drinks by paying the price of 3 cups.
6. Visited this Starbucks so many times as it just beside my house. This is the worst service I ever get and I wasted my money without any refund due to faulty cashier machine display and incompetence staff managing the store front. Very disappointed.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116209958797574772767/reviews
