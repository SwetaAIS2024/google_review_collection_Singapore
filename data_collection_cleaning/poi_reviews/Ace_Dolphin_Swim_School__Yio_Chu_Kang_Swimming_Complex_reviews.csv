Madeline Lim,5,"My children has been attending swimming lesson with Ace Dolphin since 2018 with the youngest joining their lesson in 2023.

The Coaches has their way to build water confidence and safety with the toddlers/ preschoolers, sustaining their interest to attend their class every week.  Special shout-out to Coach WeiJie for his patient, fun, gentle yet firm way of conducting his classes.

The Coaches are experienced, have a standardized method and focus on strokes and stamina, thus children have good progress and  completed their Silver/ Gold SwimSafer exams progressively.

My children love attending swimming class with Ace Dolphin and I recommend parents to try them out.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114148763970109074188/reviews

elisa wong,5,I have enrolled my kid 6 year old and the coach is Wei Jie at Yiu Chu Kang Swimming pool. The coach is very patience and at the beginning my kid she doesn’t know how to swim at all. After 8 lessons now she can swim very well without floaties and now she knows freestyle and breaststroke  … it’s amazing to see her improved so much !,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116042583422608848386/reviews
