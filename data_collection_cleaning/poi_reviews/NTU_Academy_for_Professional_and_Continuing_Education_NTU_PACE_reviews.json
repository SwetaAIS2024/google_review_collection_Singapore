We were trained to be independent while getting help and care from the instructors. Our instructors still managed to squeeze in slots of time for us despite their busy schedule. We were also taught what was currently out in the market and it was a great place to learn and upskill ourselves.",

Students made to figure things out on their own even without tech background. Instructors too busy to offer help, usually don’t even reply. Doesn’t have what it takes to be an instructor. Don’t waste your money. There are other programs out there that are much better, like Trent.",
