      "text": "Wow this place is as amazing as it is massive.. I was blissfully lost in a Labyrinth of beautiful paintings and sculptures..  There are 2 sections to visit and I highly recommend spending at least an hour or 2 to visit both..    This place definitely deserves a bigger following. I can't say I minded having the whole place to myself though ;)   If you appreciate fine art in a beautifully curated pristine gallery, then be sure to make your way there. I felt privileged to have had the opportunity to do so.\n\nI am editing this review because I just read someone else's review saying that it was humid and had no Air Conditioning. When I just went 3 days ago there was definitely A/C and it was not Humid at all.. very comfortable.  Enjoy",
