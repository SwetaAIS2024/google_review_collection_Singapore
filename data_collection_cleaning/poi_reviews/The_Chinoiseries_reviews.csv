Angie,5,"A very, very, very cosy place for high-quality private dining dinner in a neighbourhood HDB! Chef and family were very welcoming and took good pride in ensuring that patrons had a very nice and relaxing time over at their restaurant (in this case, in their home ü•∞).

Was invited by my sister's boss for a gathering session with her colleagues and all of their loved ones. It was my 1st and definitely not the last time to join/visit a private dining dinner at the comfort of ones' home.

Every single dish was nicely plated, and of course, the camera had to be the 1st to 'eat'. No doubt, not only was the dishes very beautifully plated, but the taste was also of high standard.

Even though private dining can be time-consuming  but everything was worth the wait! As what we are experiencing is not solely on the food, but what matters the most also includes the atmosphere, people we are engaging with, and food that was presented to us!

Overall, the experience is superb! Thank you ü•∞",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101785911835463892296/reviews
Franck,5,"I was surprised initially of the place in a HDB. Amazing food, amazing host. Then we got inside a house and we feel as we are invited by friends. And when the food come, I felt like I was in a Michelin starred restaurant.
Highly recommended if you want to experience amazing food at a very decent price. Only regret is there was not enough chairs for everyone. I guess it will be easily fixed. I will go again for sure, as I think it is the best value in Singapore for food experience. Thanks to the amazing hosts.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115445588457017410817/reviews
Vitadeals Singapore,5,"""A delightful fine-dining experience in the charming home of husband-and-wife team Lionel and Karyn""
The experience started the moment we were warmly welcomed by French expatriate Lionel and Singaporean Karyn into their cosy apartment in the leafy enclave of Bukit Batok. Our regular group of seven wine-loving cyclist friends had come well prepared with a variety of good bottles, and by the time we had sipped some bubbles and chatted with our hosts, the first course, a delicious brouillade of silky egg and smoked salmon topped with caviar, was served. From here, each course flowed effortlessly to the next, surprising us at each turn.
A perfectly balanced red snapper ceviche was up next; ceviche can often be mouth-puckeringly sour, but this was refreshing and zingy without being too tart. All the textures played together beautifully, as did the fusion of latin and asian flavours.
The third course, a luxurious risotto topped with foie gras and morel mushrooms, really hit the spot for me.
Timing and pacing of the dishes was spot on, as we had time to savour each one without feeling rushed, and allowing plenty of time to enjoy the wine and animated conversation. As we moved from the whites to reds, the main course arrived; for me, a perfectly judged lamb loin with a pea & mint puree, accompanied by one of my all-time favourite sides, potato dauphinois. Lastly, dessert was a splendidly wobbly panacotta lightly touched with yuzu. At each point in the meal, portion sizes had been just right; by the end we were full but not in danger of falling into a food coma.
As a private dining experience, I have to give Chinoiseries 5 stars as they hit all of the right notes: warm and friendly hosts, a lovely atmosphere, delicious food, wonderful service. I think I can speak on behalf of all of my friends and say that this was an evening we will never forget.
A very big thank you to Lionel, Karyn, and their lovely daughter, who served us with such finesse and care.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109348396229055470009/reviews
Carmen Kelly,5,"If there was a Michelin star for HDB restaurants, these guys should get one!

Once the entire group (8pax) finally reached a consensus of the set menu for each course, we were very enthusiastic to try this unique style of dining. On arrival, it was a beautiful set-up in a renovated HDB home. Our hosts were extremely friendly, yet unassuming around our table of good friends for a night out together. There were five delectable courses, all detailed in presentation, great quality and most importantly, each tasting wonderful. We took multiple bottles of wine along with us (no corkage fee) to enjoy with each course. For my next visit, I will ask for a cheese option for non-dessert eaters.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114238174219550780255/reviews
