Gayan Chathuranga,5,"Maxwell MRT Station (T18) is a fantastic stop on the Thomson-East Coast Line, offering easy access to Chinatown and other popular tourist spots. The station is modern, clean, and well-maintained, with ATMs available for added convenience.

Its proximity to Chinatown makes it an excellent starting point for exploring local culture, food, and attractions. The signage is clear, and the station is designed for smooth navigation, even for first-time visitors.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115580882753025627106/reviews
Flo Yeow,5,"Clean, new, quiet, and very conveniently located in the middle of everything. If you're in the area for some nightlife, this station will likely be able to bring you in and out of the area.

I personally take the train to Orchard MRT, before switching out to other train lines.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews

Wee Gim Hong (Nbss),5,"This place is really cool! Really convenient for people who lives around here nearby like the Buddha Tooth Relic temple there which there are houses beside it! So these people who live nearby can get to Marina Bay easily with the help of the new opening of phrase 3!

Also quite a nice design of MRT station which one platform is on the top while other at the bottom so its similar types like other stations like Promenade, Stevens, City Hall, Raffles Place and other stations that have the same design as these! Quite useful for this because if I of the platform the train has broken down but the other wasn‚Äôt so the platform for one side won‚Äôt be so crowded!!‚ò∫Ô∏èüíï",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105439552809381147212/reviews
