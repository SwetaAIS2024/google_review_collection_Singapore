Jaya B,5,"Dr. Narendra is an extemely knowledgable Homeopathy doctor and is detailed in his diagnosis.

He has helped me treat the acute rhinitis for my son to a large extent.
He made the consultations seamless and even arranged for the medicines to be delivered to us. I like how he also suggested some practical solutions to relieve the symtoms. He is a pleasure to interacr with and is extremely patient.

Indeed, we are relieved to see our son respond to his medication and will continue to seek his advise on other matters as well.

Atit Divecha,5,"I suffered with hives for over 6 months with no allopathy Doctor able to detect the cause. I visited Wellness in December '16 and was treated by Doctor Narendar, he was able to correctly identify the issue and treat me. Over a month of me visiting Narendar weekly I have seen a remarkable improvement, I have moved from having anti allergy daily to avoid hives to now being completely off medicines. Thanks to doctor Narendar.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100062958367478896659/reviews
