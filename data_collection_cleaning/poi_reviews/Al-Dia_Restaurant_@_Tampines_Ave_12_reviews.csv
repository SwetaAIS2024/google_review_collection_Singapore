Kelvin Wee,2,"Dodgy eatery. No price menu. Have to ask every time you order.

J Koh,1,Edible dosai. One ( looks/acts like the owner) of the Indians working there was extremely hostile and arrogant . He acted like as tho I am getting free food from him or trying to steal from him. What a mean person. Terrible experience.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107905117712032157695/reviews
Tsin W61,4,The roti parata is not oily and good to eat when hot. Come with different curry but spicy and hot. Outside the coffee shop still under renovation but well covered up.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112246979209348273781/reviews
