Flo Yeow,5,"If you walk one round starting from the carpark, you'll definitely come across this within the first 5 minutes. Read the sign boards, come have a look, then you could zoom right by or choose to immerse yourself in the history of the place. You'll also pass by the 1892 storeroom, which has interesting stories behind it. Watch out for these things on your hike here!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
