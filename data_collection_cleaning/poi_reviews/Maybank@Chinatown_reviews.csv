Mona Hum,1,"Maybank Chinatown, please remove your number if there is no intention to take calls. Been calling even the 1800 number, no one will pick up. They pick up n drop the call. Have to listen to the prerecorded message and then the phone will ring and thats 4-5 min of your time wasted. Terrible. They prefer customer visit the branches.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110963259690659350207/reviews

A C (Harmony),4,"The male officer at counter 5 (didn't get his name) on 13 Aug 24 between 12.30 to 12.40pm, is courteous and fast in handling my renewal of FD.  When I took out my passbook, he even offered to update for me before I asked for it. All done within 10 minutes. Keep up the good work!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104859071375776359653/reviews
Pher Pher,5,The warm and friendly service from Shufen at reception and the efficiency of Christine at the counter was amazing. This branch gets really busy at peak hour but I have never had delays in getting my requests processed. The team here are very helpful and detailed in making sure I understand how to login or troubleshoot online banking matters.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104207221394675720609/reviews
