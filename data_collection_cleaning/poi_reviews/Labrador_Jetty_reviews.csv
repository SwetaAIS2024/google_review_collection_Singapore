Damcho Tshering,5,"Spent a peaceful moment at Labrador Jetty today, surrounded by the gentle sea breeze and the calming sound of waves. This spot offers stunning views of the coastline, with ships dotting the horizon and a beautiful sunset painting the sky.

It’s the perfect place to relax, reflect, or simply enjoy the scenic beauty. Whether you’re taking a leisurely stroll along the boardwalk or just soaking in the views, Labrador Jetty is a hidden gem worth visiting!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833702802756994837/reviews
D S,5,It’s stunning both in the day and night. The breeze at night is wonderful and calming with stars in the skies :’) for joggers - the trail from the bukit chermin broadwalk > labrador jetty > harbourfront center is around 5km!

JOcean,4,"This is a nice spot to take sunset photos with backdrop of the sea, ships and cranes from the ports. From the jetty, you can also see the view of the cliffs/forests/rocky beaches of labrador park.

A stroll along the jetty will show you how popular this place is as a fishing spot. On the weekends, it is very common to see the fishing enthusiasts dotted around the jetty with their fishing gear, tackle box and even cooler boxes to store their catches from late afternoons all the way to the wee hours of the morning.

This is a good place to drop by for sea breeze and sunset view.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108329577068431544730/reviews
Halcyon CPE 1,5,"Love the breeze and open space under the sky. Can see lots of stars at night if not cloudy. Lots of people fishing and relaxing in at the jetty. Nice to look into their styrofoam boxes and pails to see what has been caught. Families, couples, exercising people - all love this open jetty.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111567912246828088820/reviews
CheongHwa Tan,5,Sunset was beautiful yesterday. A try nice breezy day to go take pictures at dusk. Fishing is allowed in designated areas. It takes 1 minute to walk from the car park area to the entrance and 15 minutes from there to the jetty.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115458814733161117261/reviews
