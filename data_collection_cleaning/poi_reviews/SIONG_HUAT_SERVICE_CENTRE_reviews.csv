Hilo,5,"Uncle here super nice.
We were driving half way, just happened that I wanna go washroom, and just happened that my hubby decide to park at the esso instead of nearby Thomson Plaza, just happened that when waiting for me my hubby decide to pump the wheels and found out that there is a nail in the tyre. And just happened that there is this service center at this petrol station. Else so dangerous to drive with a nail in the tyre on highway.
Friendly uncle and fix the issue very fast. Hassle free.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113979234724850405097/reviews
