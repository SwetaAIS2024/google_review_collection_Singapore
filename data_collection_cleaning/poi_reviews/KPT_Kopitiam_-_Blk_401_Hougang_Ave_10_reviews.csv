Choon Kit Leong,3,"This is a very vibrant 24 hour Kopitiam aka coffee shop in the heartland. It is located across ponggol park and next to the park connector.

This coffee shop has many stalls offering a huge variety of food and cuisine. Mostly reasonably but not cheaply priced.

It can get very very busy most of the time and it can be difficult to get a seat.

The crowd can get a bit rowdy especially with those who drink or when the groups of folks who came in after their cycling or exercising sessions. All very safe yet have a good vibe.

Good place for supper. Highly recommended.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105403566482999279179/reviews

Saint Ong,1,"Requested chilli and more seared and crispy when I placed my oyster omelette order.
But end up a very horrible fried oyster omelette that i ever had, very disappointed. I patron this stall at mid night 12am, i was totally not busy at all. the per person who Fried this omelette really don't bother what customer had requested. And she really did not fried with heart and don't know what is the authentic nice oyster omelette is. What I ate the photo can tell.
the omelette they served me was 100% different from their signage one, and also very bad compared with their omelette before renovation.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102507589286953081585/reviews

CK Liew,5,"Very good fish soup. But customers must be careful, if you’re allergic to prawns, they add in dried shrimps by default. Need to ask to exclude. I was quite shocked when I first ate it. But otherwise, all good! Fish is fresh! Wouldn’t say there’s a lot of fish, I always add $3 for more fish. Quality > Quantity!

If you dine in, and are feeling broke, you can’t save 50 cents even if you don’t want the rice! It’s a set! The uncle told me.

Hopefully you’re rich and abundant when eating this delicious fish soup!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112208548260500016209/reviews
