Peter,5,"Hidden Indian stall at Serangoon Garden Market. The roti prata is light and not oily, just how I like it. The fish curry is rich and flavorful. The friendly owner even serves the food to your table when itâ€™s not too busy. Definitely worth a try!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101186173999273020853/reviews

Toni Tan,5,"Yumzz! One of the best fried mee goreng we had in a long time. Fried the old school,old fashioned way,with crispy fried tau kwa & potato cubes. A long lost taste that me & my wife missed from our childhood. And a price friendly $3.5. Please give it a try!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107632336872053855655/reviews
Christopher Koh,5,"Unassuming place but with tasty food.

The masala dosai - the dough could be crispier, but it had lovely tangy flavor and the filling was well apportioned and the potatoes were nice and soft and good flavor steeped in.

Also tried the pepper chicken - tender and not dried out. Flavorful and spicy! The vadai was a rather boring though.

Bought two masala dosais, one portion of pepper chicken and one vadai for $12. Really nice price point!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104262271032362286480/reviews
Angela Ng,5,"Really tasty thosai and prata! I especially like that the thosai is nicely fermented, giving it that lovely tang and umami flavour. Prata is crispy and served with a delicious fish curry. Yums.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104787939210519628682/reviews
