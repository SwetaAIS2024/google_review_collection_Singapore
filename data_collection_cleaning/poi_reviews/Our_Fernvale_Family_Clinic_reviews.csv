Aly Tan,5,"Fuss free registration, friendly receptionist and doctor. Consulted with Dr Wendy who was patient to hear my symptoms and offer advice.

Clinic is clean and seems like they offer many services including health checks.

Only gripe is that there is not many waiting seats in the clinic so might need to sit outside which can be quite warm.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114128420561771430867/reviews
Scott Khoo,5,"I can't express enough how grateful I am to have found Dr. Nicole Chan.

From the moment I walked into the consultation room, she took the time to listen to all my concerns and explained everything in detail, making sure I felt comfortable and confident moving forward with treatment. I felt very welcomed, heard and understood. Her expertise and genuine care was very evident and I would highly recommend her to anyone in need of top-notch care!

Thank you so much Dr. Nicole! It is truly rare to find a doctor who prioritizes her patients in the way that you do!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105964600293537400026/reviews
