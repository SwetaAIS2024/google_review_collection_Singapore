      "text": "Visited Mel‚Äôs Drive-In on a Saturday just before noon. The diner had a great retro vibe, and to our surprise, there was no queue at that time. Service was quick, and the food was served promptly. The tandoori chicken burger was a delightful twist‚Äîflavorful and satisfying. The sweet potato fries were crispy and paired well with the meal. Overall, a fun dining experience with a nostalgic atmosphere, perfect for a quick bite during your Universal Studios visit. Would recommend stopping by!",

The chicken nuggets and milkshake were good but I wouldn't recommend eating there. There are better options in the Park such as the pizza for the same money.",
