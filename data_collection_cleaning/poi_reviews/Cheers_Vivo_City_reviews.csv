Rupam Das,5,"Pretty good place to go shopping (or window shopping). If you feel like chilling, go to the top floor - it has a sensational view of the rest of the city. There‚Äôs also a pool.

Flo Yeow,5,"I've always enjoyed some quiet time here at the waterfront promenade, in front of Vivocity. It's a good directional indicator, especially if you tell people to just walk towards the river, face the river on the left, etc. Night times can be chill and quiet, great for dates and walks. Also, you get to see glimpses of Sentosa from here.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
