      "text": "Ordered the bigger portion of grilled fish as we were hungry and it came with 2 fishes which was quite a lot. It would have been great if the service staff advised us against it. There was quite little soup as well, which was a pity as the soup was nice to drink albeit oily, which is pretty normal. Service staff were friendly and offered us the private room, although a bit cold. The century egg tofu was had a refreshing taste. Dumpling skin was a bit thick and wouldn't recommend. Overall still a pleasant experience.\n\nUpdate 15.09.2026\nService still as great\n\nUpdate 09.01.2025\nTried the black fungus side dish today as well - worth ordering! Service still great :)",
