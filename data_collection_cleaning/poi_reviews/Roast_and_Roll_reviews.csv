jo,5,Tried this yong tau foo place earlier today and I enjoyed the laksa broth. A gentleman (presumably the boss) brought us a cup of water to accompany our spicy meal. They‚Äôre also receptive to feedback and are trying to move towards less plastic waste when dining in. Would recommend to my peers! :),a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105534989983196060934/reviews
Sharon Low,5,"I‚Äôm not usually a fan of yong tau fu, but this place won me over. The soup is flavorful despite being MSG-free, and it doesn‚Äôt leave a salty aftertaste. The fried items are perfectly crisp, and all the ingredients look and taste fresh and clean. There‚Äôs also a great selection of condiments, including various sauces, peanuts, coriander, and spring onions. The only downside is that the waiting time can be quite long after ordering",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110763902249717088053/reviews
Angel Tan,5,"Admittedly feeling a tad reluctant to post about this place lest it becomes too crowded and I need to queue up‚Ä¶ but I guess good things must be shared üò©

Got introduced to this place recently and I‚Äôm a convert! Cheap, good, quick and yummy. Not only that, free-flow condiments and they have such a huge variety as well ü•≤ Recommend for folks working at MBFC, where there‚Äôs a lack of such eateries!

c lex,5,"Probably one of the more affordable options in the area, the base soup was clean and tasty. The owner says there‚Äôs no msg added which is a plus in my book. There‚Äôs also a sauce station hdl-self service style which is unique!

It‚Äôs meant to be a takeaway joint so there‚Äôs no tableware besides takeaway boxes even if you choose to dine in at their little booth seats. So bring your own lunch box and cutlery to save on the waste.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117982194656701556655/reviews
