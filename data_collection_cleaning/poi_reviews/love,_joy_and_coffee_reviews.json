Was impressed with the scrambled eggs as it were nicely scrambled soft and not overly cooked. The vanilla latte a tag too sweet but nonetheless the aroma was inspiring.  Have not tried other items on the menu but it's worth while going there to experience the food and drinks!  Most of the time u can find table to sit at non peak lunch hours.",

Got the recommended sourdough Grilled p&p, flat white, iced German coffee (?) with cream (Einspaner) and banana bread. $38.50 with service charge. No service charge on weekdays. The one taking our order was not awake and I think really too tired out",

Sometimes depend on lucks if the cafe are not specialised in coffee but surprisingly their coffee is good, I always go for the white ($5.5)üëçüèª desserts wise I recommend hojicha (the green colour cream on top ), not too sweet , goes well with coffee , the other one that has the same look but different colour I think is espresso banana cake. My friend would recommend the muscat soda too. Overall is my recommended cafe ü•∞",
