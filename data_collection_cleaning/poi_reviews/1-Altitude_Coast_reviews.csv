Bryan Fang,5,"A really nice and cosy rooftop bar area with a swimming pool with adults-only access.

Bar's menu has food offerings from the restaurant next to it. Alcohol offerings is extensive. Beer, wine, cocktails, mocktails and juices.

Has an amazing view of the entire beach line and the sea.

A very good place to get a free show of Wings Of Time at Siloso beach.

Staff here are friendly and service is quick.

Great place to hangout at night.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114490699769830179262/reviews

WHOLESOME EE HEALTHY FASTFOOD,4,"I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was inviting, and the service provided by Jack was top-notch. One suggestion for improvement would be to update the glassware. Using newer, more polished glassware would enhance the presentation and overall quality of the beverages. Otherwise, everything was great!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106800893781775542828/reviews

The food was delightful, and the service was outstanding. The views and ambiance added to the overall experience, making it a truly enjoyable meal.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111446563580895157804/reviews
