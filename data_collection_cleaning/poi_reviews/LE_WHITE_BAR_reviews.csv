Amber Deux,4,"If you want food, can ask them for bar bite menu or slightly marked up zi char menu. There is a zi char shop just behind the bar. The sound system is good with a very big tv screen, the bar is very spacious. Good place to chill at Orto. They have a few rooms also, and a big one with a mini stage.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103937834318495304089/reviews
Kg Tan,5,"At last, a cool chill out place in the West, at Orto West Coast.

Le White, place w Pool (decently good players), darts, KTV, live band and igood food.  Can't ask for more.
- KTV sound system brings out the singer in you.
- Pool players push you to improve
- live band brings comfy entertainment
- friendly owners.

Their food range, a few self created bar bites, good thin crust pizza, cosy setting, friendly atmosphere.

Makes you want to return.

Thumbs up guys.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101653866876726623281/reviews
