Nicole Chu,5,"Pretty good deal. They are generous with the banchan and you can get extras of the ones that you like.

We ordered the pork, beef and chicken set to try a variety of meats. They were tasty enough, although we felt that the pork and chicken could‚Äôve had more flavour. The marinade for the beef was the best.

A staff member cooks for you at your table, allowing you to focus on eating, although it can feel a bit cramped. At the end of the meal, you can get a free potong ice cream from the freezer.

We‚Äôd be happy to come back.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100713739271430140501/reviews
Lynn Teo,4,"Staying at Almas Suites over the weekend and wanted to find somewhere near for a good dinner. Chanced upon this Korean restaurant in the area and decided to give it a try.

Ordered the beef set and it did not disappoint. The staff helped in cooking the food for us. What drew me to the restaurant when I walked past was the huge selection of side dishes I saw the patrons had on their table. The side dishes were good.

Food was fresh. And free ice cream (red bean, mango, coffee or durian) to choose from after dinner. Will consider coming back again if I‚Äôm in the area.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115585109953891091925/reviews
