Winnie Ng,1,"The worst dining experience ever! ðŸ¤¬

If I could give 0.5 stars instead of 1, I would! On Valentineâ€™s Day of all days, they completely ruined the experience by taking 30-minute intervals to serve each dishâ€”leaving everyone waiting endlessly. And the best part? They took a glass of water from another table, REFILLED it, and gave it to meâ€”while giving MY glass to someone else! ðŸ¤¢ How unhygienic and ridiculous is that?!

Despite having so many staff, they couldnâ€™t serve proper food, nor could they provide even the most basic service.

Absolute worst place! ðŸš¨ I DO NOT recommend coming here at all! Save your time, money, and sanity! ðŸ¤¬",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117446599457778007146/reviews

Donald Isaac,3,"The place was empty with not much people on newyears eve. We were a party of 5 that decided to have dinner there.

The food was  on the salty side. It was still pleasant and tasty. Service was good even when they only had 2 floor staff.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111620843433357170307/reviews
Irvin Woon,1,"Sat at 815pm for a 3 course meal. 915pm now. I only had my soup. After 1 hour. WHAT NONSENSE!?

930pm then I get my main course. Food is cold/light warm. Not hot servedâ€¦

And you close at 10pm. So what time will I get my dessert?

Close down please. Dont spoil peopleâ€™s mood to dine out please. Seevice staff are like blind camels walking around. Acting like they dont see you despite raising and waving your hand, and saying HELLO. Seriouslyâ€¦.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101616671085948072246/reviews
Philip Barr,5,"Arrived early at 7:15pm and knowing it would be a difficult night for the staff with all the V-Day couples wanting quick service, decided to eat at the Wharf before heading upstairs to the Beacon to enjoy the live music which we did at 8:15pm. Place was packed for the outside seating but not quite so indoors. We noticed a few couples needed to wait a while for their table to be ready, but they could have chosen to be seated inside. Having a live band in quite a small space would hardly be conducive to a quiet romantic dinner. Naturally with a restaurant like this itâ€™s reasonable to expect a relaxed dining experience not the quick service you get downstairs. Noticed quite a few grumpy couples, some wearing their cheapest Walmart outfits. Heart & Soul is a great band and of course they have an enthusiastic following that just love the mix of old and new favourites. Of course rock music can be loud and rock music patrons love to sing along. We had a wonderful time, as we always do with this venue and this band and feel sorry for the patrons that had expected a quiet romantic dinner where a live rock band is featured.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106294037425912872276/reviews
