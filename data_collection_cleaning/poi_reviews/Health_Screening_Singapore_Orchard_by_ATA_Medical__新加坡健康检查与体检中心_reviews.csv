Mavis Sum-Tsoi,5,"I wanted to express my thanks and compliment the team at ATA Medical Centre for the exceptional service and professionalism during the recent health screening for my helper, Helen, and the subsequent doctor review over Zoom.

From the thoroughness of the screening process to the insightful consultation with Dr. Joel, I was deeply impressed by the smooth and seamless experience. I especially appreciated the team’s thoughtful communication, keeping me informed about the slight delay in the consultation rather than leaving me in the dark.

Dr. Joel’s expertise, professionalism, attention to detail, and compassionate demeanor provided reassurance and confidence throughout the experience. Helen was also happy and at ease during the process.

Thank you once again for your outstanding service.

Matej Mejak,5,"Had a great experience at ATA Medical Orchard! The staff were incredibly kind and professional, and they even accommodated me despite arriving more than 30 minutes early. I have medical reasons that make it difficult to take my blood, but they handled it extremely well with great skill and care. Really appreciate their efficiency and warm service. Highly recommend!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106210268670407030511/reviews
Regine Lee,5,"I wanted to do a vitamin deficiency test and I tried googling and only saw this Clinic offering this kind of test. I have checked with Polyclinic. They also don’t provide this type of test. Therefore, I decided to do the comprehensive vitamin deficiency test with ATA. Price is affordable. They are conveniently located near Orchard Boulevard MRT station. The clinic looks like a hotel lobby, very atas and posh. I was in and out of the Clinic within 15 minutes. Service is friendly and efficient.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108466794852380842275/reviews
