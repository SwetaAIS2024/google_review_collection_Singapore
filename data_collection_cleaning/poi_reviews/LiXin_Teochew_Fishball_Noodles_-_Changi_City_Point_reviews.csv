Ems Huang,3,"for the price of $6, noodles can be a little bit more.  dry with chilli but chilli not mixed in properly as per image. a little too much tomato for my liking

fish balls are QQ, not too bad.
the noodles is ok also

but the soup is tasteless.

apparently can pay by visa, master, paylah but it is via Fave or smth.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104198526648239583979/reviews
JH Lee,5,"After a long trip, I came back to Singapore craving comfort food, and these fishball noodles hit the spot! The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the fishballs had a great texture and flavor. It was exactly what I needed to feel at home again. Definitely a must-try if you‚Äôre looking for something tasty and satisfying. Highly recommend!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106734622638796351916/reviews
Lim Zu Xian,1,"I used to eat Li Xin Fishball noodles at Viva Biz Park which was pretty good.

And this outlet gave me a surprise that different outlet can have such different standards.

The noodles sauce comes with chili and tomato. I just want to ask who in the right mind put tomato sauce in dry noodles. It was bad. My wife‚Äôs mee tai mak was super oily, call it oil noodles if you want.

Service just pure bad, they just serve you super slowly, make you queue, just hope you that you don‚Äôt patronize it. Good that they did that, so i hope this review helps you to avoid this store. üëç",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107800823644659329079/reviews
Di Di,5,"The noodles were cooked al dente. Even though I asked for the dried chilli version, it did not taste spicy which was alright for me as I realised that one is not able to stomach spicy food as one ages.

The wanton was crispy with just a nice amount of filling which was chewy. The chef mistook my order of favourites as special. I think it was due to a language barrier. He was nice enough to recook it for me though as I would really love the soft boiled egg. It added much umami flavour to the noodles.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
