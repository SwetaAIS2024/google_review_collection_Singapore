沈维聪（沈哥三少）,5,"One of the best place to eat western food inside SP campus. Always want to go but do not have the luck. Finally got the chance to visit during one of the personal training session.

Their chicken chop and fish n chips are great. Heard from the owner uncle he uses 7 different herbs to grill his chicken chop. Really taste nice. Recommend to all of you who studied there or got opportunities to visit there for self improvement courses

They are conveniently located near at a hill top near to FC3.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110231997565844347284/reviews
Enthony Lim,5,"had a pleasant dining experience at Cafe @ Moberly. I dined in for lunch and found the atmosphere to be cozy and welcoming. The food was decent, but what really stood out was the friendly and attentive service. The boss was incredibly friendly and kind, taking the time to share his experiences and stories with us, which added a personal touch to our visit. The overall experience was made memorable by the excellent service and warm atmosphere. I would recommend this cafe for a casual and friendly dining experience.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109163310210573465685/reviews

Juwy Lim,4,"Moberly Block was probably the only historic building from British colonial that you still can find within the premises of Singapore Polytechnic. Used to be rumoured as haunted building by the students, it is renovated and reopened in 2006.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108263561354255362060/reviews
