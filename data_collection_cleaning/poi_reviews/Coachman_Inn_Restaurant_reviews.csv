Poh Soh Lee,5,"Lovely lunch at this scenic spot. Ordered curry fish head, fragrant chicken, pork chop and ginger garlic venison meat. Every dish was spot onâ€¦ ok, maybe curry fishhead can be a tad saltier.
It was midday and really hot. Luckily restaurant has many standing fans to blow away the heat. Pretty breezy I would say.
Best to call ahead for reservations. Almost full house today.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107301070285258783270/reviews
HG Tan,5,"Restaurant had set menus on their house specials. I must say its really worth considering if you're going there with a good appetite.  We ordered a portion of the set, short of an appetizer, main, desserts and still had a filling meal since we ordered their fishhead curry which is highly recommended.    The final bill was reasonable and with a great seaview and sea breeze, it's worthy of 5 stars.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114042566224881242127/reviews
Janice Tan,5,"Like the food and the ambiance here. The beach is very near to the restaurant. Literally, dine by the sea. Quality of food is good and the price is very reasonable too. The fish head curry is a must try. Do make a reservation before you head out here. This restaurant is very popular especially during weekends.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101929610972626820123/reviews

Shella S,5,"We had an excellent lunch! Service was prompt and attentive, your water glass will constantly be topped up. Food came quickly and they were all really good!

We had the crispy lotus roots, dry fried kway teow, Kang kong belachan and grilled squid with their house mixed cincalok sauce. Portions were generous too, these 4 dishes could have fed 3, but since it was just us 2, we happily overate.

Props to the team esp Dayes, for a wonderful meal with a view of the sea :)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100220403049727034234/reviews
