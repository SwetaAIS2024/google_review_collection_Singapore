Iuh,1,"This was probably my 3rd or 4th time buying paper wrapped chicken from this outlet in the past 4 years  and I've been left disgusted.

3 yrs ago, received very slimy chicken that was definitely spoilt- it tasted like natto (see 3rd & 4th pic). Boycotted them for 2 yrs+ and decided to give them a try again. Got another slimy chicken on a weekend afternoon. üëè

Do be careful when you buy for your kids or seniors.

I have bought this item many times at other outlets before so I am certain the taste nor texture isnt normal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102160478429602087624/reviews

Charles Poiron,2,"I must admit I was a bit skeptical of so many bad reviews, but still wanted to try some of the dim sums. My take on it is the service is confirmed horrible, and yes by the same lady that most other reviewers mention. Of course we don't expect 5-star restaurant service with a smile, but there's also a bare minimum expected standard with this place doesn't hit, just too rude... And why?... I feel generous at 2-star because the food was ok, not amazing, but there are better dim sum places to go. (2-star is already higher than average of 1.7 stars at the time of this posting!)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107277345878369642371/reviews
creme creme,1,"Disgusted by their un-freshness of ingredients used, or even worse long kept frozen products. Billed me with lots of missing items as well. Refused to give me the stupid receipt upon request.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113598922209669099177/reviews
