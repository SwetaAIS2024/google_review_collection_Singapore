The chicken gizzard is chunky and nice to bite, the rice isn't that fragrance however will be perfect when you put a good decent amount of their homemade chilli and ginger on the rice.",

The chicken meat was tender and moist, however the jiggly gelatin-like texture layer under the skin was lacking.",

Veggie dish is tasty too and not salty with the sauce all over it.\n\nWill return again with all family members in full force to sample more dishes.",

      "text": "A Hidden Gem That Deserves a Michelin Star\n\nAt first glance, I thought this was just another chicken rice joint‚Äîhumble, unassuming, and like countless others I‚Äôve visited. But the moment I took my first bite, I knew I was wrong. Completely, utterly wrong.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just chicken rice. This is chicken rice redefined. The steamed chicken was so tender and flavorful that it felt like my taste buds were giving a standing ovation. Who knew something as simple as steamed chicken could taste this divine?\n\nNow, let me make a confession. I don‚Äôt eat chicken feet. Ever. In fact, I have a phobia of them. But their chicken feet? Game-changing. Life-altering. Paired with the sweet and sour sauce, it was an unexpected masterpiece‚Äîone I never thought I‚Äôd find myself raving about.\n\nComing from a chicken rice culture, I can confidently say this is the best steamed chicken rice I‚Äôve ever had. And the sides? Impeccable. Every dish was thoughtfully prepared, down to the smallest detail.\n\nBut what really blew me away was the atmosphere‚Äîmodest, down-to-earth, and yet serving food worthy of the Michelin Guide. Honestly, if this place doesn‚Äôt get a star soon, I might just start my own food awards and crown it myself.\n\nAnd just when I thought the experience couldn‚Äôt get any better, they handed out Christmas gifts. Gifts! Talk about going the extra mile. I sat there, stunned, taking a deep breath of amazement‚Äîand maybe even a moment of silence out of respect.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt make your way here, you‚Äôre robbing yourself of one of the most satisfying meals you‚Äôll ever have. Seriously. Don‚Äôt miss out.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just a restaurant. It‚Äôs an experience.",
