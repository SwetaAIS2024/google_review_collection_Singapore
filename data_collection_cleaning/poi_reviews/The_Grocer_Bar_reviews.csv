Martin Low,4,"We did not see any menu, but there were some promos on cocktails, specific brand beer and an oyster+wine set.

Food/Drinks: Oysters were kept live in a tank and shucked to order. Drinks are mostly canned or bottles, though there was stout beer on tap promo when we went. You can also bring in drinks from the supermarket at a corkage fee of $8.

Service: Friendly and there are promoters that let you sample different wines/beers. Non cash payment only.

Atmosphere: It is sort of like a secret spot where locals/CBD workers hang out for drinks after work. There are somewhat limited seats and seats are packed closely to one another.

Prices: slightly cheaper than average Bar prices.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113894121481913544527/reviews
Drew Esa,5,"A very unusual and pleasant place! It started raining outside when we were in Fair Price Finest, so my wife and I decided to just wait out the rain with a glass of wine in the bar, which is located right in the supermarket, between the wine and cheese departments! Great idea! I recommend it to everyone.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100231074350729929090/reviews
Ivan Loh,5,"One of the most underrated watering holes in the Orchard area! Located within the Fairprice Finest at The Centrepoint, this bar offers draft beers at $6.90, and you can purchase wines from the supermarket to enjoy there too. Corkage is $8 per bottle of wine, which is super reasonable. You can even get bottles of liquor (gin, whiskey, etc.) from the supermarket to drink there as well. The concept is great! Not only can you buy the cooked food, sushi, and cheeses from the counters, you can even buy steaks, and they will grill it to your desired doneness. It does get crowded, so expect to wait a little for a seat during peak hours.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114542374982525257775/reviews
The Chopsticks,4,Decided to check this place out with a friend on sunday afternoon. When we reach about 3.30pm it was almost full house.. so we are left to take the bar seat. Looking around the find the wine we want and we got a bottle $29 and a corkage fee $8. Good ambience and friendly staff behind the counter.. evryone is enjoying their drinks and so do we.. affordable place to get your wine fix with food available from the supermarket that you can purchase it. Will be back for more drinks! Cheap and enough selection of wines to enjoy.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114074037543764533929/reviews
Bernie Chin,4,"Quite surprised to see this bar in FairPrice Finest. Decided to give it a try. The price is really very reasonable. They served 3 tap beers, $7.90 nett for 330ml. You can also purchase any wine from FairPrice and pay $5 corkage to have your bottle of wine there. Cosy environment. One thing I donâ€™t quite like about this place, when you order, they expect you to make payment straightaway. It can be quite troublesome if you are planning to chill there for a bit, drinking a few rounds. You will be expected to get up from your seat, make payment for every round of beer that you order.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109214621085246958273/reviews
