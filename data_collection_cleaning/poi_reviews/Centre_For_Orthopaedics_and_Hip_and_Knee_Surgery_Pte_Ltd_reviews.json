The reviews you've read about him before this are true - he's not only a knowledgeable and experienced doctor (you can already tell from how he explains), he's also compassionate and kind. His nurse assistants (2 of them) are accommodating and helpful - apologies, I forgot their names.",

      "text": "I am a 62 year old English, Singaporean PR, having been fortunate to live in Singapore since 2001.  I consider myself as Singlish.\nIn my younger days I was an avid rugby player.  At 19 I played for the Yorkshire Colts and was selected for the national squad.  My club rugby was with Headingley, in Leeds.\nI have always enjoyed been physically active and maintained a reasonable level of fitness.  I consider not been able to enjoy physical challenges to be a serious deterioration in the quality of my life.\nI first met Dr Jeffery Chew when I slipped a disc in 2016.  I was on contract in KL at the time, but chose to struggle back to my home in Singapore, rather than seek local treatment.\nI went immediately from the airport, to what is today Parkway hospital.  Within the hour I had been x-rayed, scanned and admitted to the ward.  Shortly after arriving on the ward I met Dr Jeffery Chew.  It quickly became obvious that I had been fortunate in my hospital selection, as Dr Jeffery was an excellent physician and I was in the best of care.\nI received traction treatment and with in a week back walking around and two weeks back at work.\nA few years later my wife was running in the local park and fell whilst negotiating a flight of stairs, breaking her collar bone.\nI immediate sort out Dr Jeffery.  Her collar bone had two breaks and needed to have a metal support fitted.\nThe procedure was a complete success, my wife was back on her feet in a matter of days.\nIn 2019 there was an obvious deterioration in my right hip.  Pain was evident with any lateral hip movement or whilst climbing a number of stairs.  Dr. Jeffery recommend an immediate hip replacement.  I had the operation on the 15 August 2019.  On the 16 August I was walking using a zimmer frame and a week later, unaided. 6-weeks later my scars had all healed and I was back doing my normal exercise regime.\nOn the 30-June-2021, I circumnavigated Singapore on a mountain bicycle, covering a distance of 130km.",

      "text": "Dr Yegappan answered with 3 letters to all my questions posted - M R I. He responded simply yes or no to my questions, sniggered with his nurses when I probed in depth because there was nothing he could diagnose without an MRI. Review was done in 8 minutes and that was me asking as many questions I could to understand my problem. 0 Empathy nor care towards his patients. I had knee pain and not once did he bother LOOKING at the knee. Shrugged me off as that I’m still young. Complete waste of a visit, similar to other reviews posted.",
