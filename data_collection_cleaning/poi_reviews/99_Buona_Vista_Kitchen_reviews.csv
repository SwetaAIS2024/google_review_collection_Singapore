Jeffrey Ng,5,"This is a great spot for Tze Char dishes in the South Buona Vista area. The menu offers a wide variety of options, so there's something for everyone. We ordered the Hor Fun with egg and the Fried Rice with egg, both of which were delicious.

The service was efficient; our food arrived promptly not long after placing our order. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous, making it great value for money.

The taste was satisfyingâ€” the Hor Fun had a smooth, silky texture with a savory, rich gravy, and the Fried Rice was fragrant with a nice. Highly recommended!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114361573681952194788/reviews
Glenn Tan,5,"Ventured further out for lunch after church service today. Ordered the famous moonlight hor fun, prawn paste chicken, marmite ribs and other food...
The recommended dishes were awesome, especially the moonlight hor fun.
The venue is non air-conditioned and under the sweltering heat of the afternoon sun, be prepared to perspire. Yet this is well worth the food and nothing that an iced drink cannot solve.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102304578226313043857/reviews
