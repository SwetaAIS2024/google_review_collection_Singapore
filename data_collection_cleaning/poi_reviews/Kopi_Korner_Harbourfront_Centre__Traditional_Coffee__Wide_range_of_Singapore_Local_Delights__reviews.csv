Keng Cheong Tan,4,Great local food at reasonable prices. Got the chicken curry which is so on point and goes well with the crunch baguette bread. Mee Siam is also full of flavour. Pairs well with the tea and kopi,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102762619432424724330/reviews
SHAHRUNNIZAM AB MALIK,2,"Cashier Auntie with grey hair and green nail polish, $5.80 I got my half boiled egg yolks with spoon thrown on my yolk.Other places wonâ€™t even throw the spoon in. Not to mention broke my eggs with bare hands green nail polish. The other Chinese  staff much better helpful attitude. Only 1 more other customer besides me in the whole place - so place was still quite empty. Last time I will come here.
