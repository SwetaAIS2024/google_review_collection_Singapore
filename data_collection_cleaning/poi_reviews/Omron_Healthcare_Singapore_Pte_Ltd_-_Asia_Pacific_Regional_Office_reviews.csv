Patrick Lim,5,"I sent 2 sets of HEM 7600T BP monitor for service on 16/08/24. Although I didn’t make any prior appointment, service staff, Irene accepted my request with very sincere and cheerful attitude. She also took the time to explain the warranty policy clearly. At the same time she understood my predicament with empathy and gave very good advice to my reasons for having 2 similar devices. At the end of visit, I got an upgraded device for my immediate needs while my own devices are under service. It’s difficult these days to find such dedicated employees and I hope the company will take note of her sincerity and dedication in going beyond her call of duty in serving the customers. My deepest appreciation to Irene and best wishes for your future. I declare that I am not related to her in any way and we met for the first time on that day.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103600759653847128115/reviews
greenleaves,1,"Purchased a OMRON nebruliser via Shoppee but it wasn't working (cannot even turn it on) and the customer service team refused to accept returns/exchange as its a medical device, even though its a brand new unit.

Scheduling a date for servicing took time as their online calendar is quite packed. So eventually I made my way to their service center, east to west 2 way Grab cost additional $50 (its a far walk from main road)

After an hour of waiting, they found the unit to have a motherboard issue and assigned me another brand new unit.

A waste of time and money which I wasn't compensated for and no apologies.

OMRON CS team on Shoppee could have managed it better since the fault is not mine. For this I give 1 star.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101541310667508814877/reviews

Chelseagkx,5,"I was served by Irene Lee last Monday and I’m absolutely blown away by her attention to detail and excellent service!! Even though she clearly had a lot of work on her plate, she was so patient to explain everything to me step by step. Extremely knowledgeable in her products too!! She definitely deserves a raise, and is a star in Omron! I hope she is praised and rewarded by the company!! Please treasure a staff like her, it’s so hard to find such great service/sales staff!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102778082974422361169/reviews
