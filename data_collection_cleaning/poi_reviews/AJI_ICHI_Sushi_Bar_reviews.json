      "text": "Aji Ichi Sushi Bar is conveniently located on the second level of Changi Airportâ€™s Terminal 4 Hall, right next to the food court.\n\nWe just had an incredibly pleasant and mouth-watering dining experience here. The level of service, especially from Ms. Aiyun, was outstanding. She ensured we were well taken care of every step of the way!\n\nThe food presentation felt like something out of a Japanese Masterchef Competition and the flavors were just as impressive. The grilled fish head and uni lobster sushi were the star of the show, fresh, flavorful, and simply amazing, even included some fermented ginger and authentic wasabi to cleanse the palette.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone craving high-quality sushi and excellent service at Changi Airport!\n\nðŸ’¯",

We tried the soft shell crab maki, lobster maki, spicy salmon maki and salmon teriyaki donburi and every dish was 10/10. I would highly recommend all sushi lovers to stop here whilst waiting for your flight. Staff were very kind and helpful and located in an ideal quiet spot in the airport.",

Very reasonably priced (depending on what youâ€™re getting, of course).\nThe quality of sashimi was high and fresh with good flavour.\nLobster Truffle (cold) pasta was FABULOUS, what an incredibly indulgent experience.\n\nThe staff and service were delightful, friendly, funny and super accomodating and patient with our large group of 8 diners.\n\nOne of my favourite and one of the top dining experiences I had in my 3 weeks of Singapore.",
