JC,5,"I first met Dr. Ryan Lee at Fair during my pregnancy and was immediately impressed by his warmth and professionalism. After speaking with him, we felt completely at ease and knew he was the right doctor for us. Looking back, we couldn’t be happier with our decision.

The procedure went smoothly, and my recovery has been excellent—the incision healed beautifully with minimal discomfort.

Dr. Ryan is not only highly skilled but also genuinely caring. I’m incredibly grateful for his expertise and support and would highly recommend him to anyone looking for an exceptional OB-GYN!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104656847817193601624/reviews

Jessica Rhane Go,5,"Meeting Dr Ryan for the first time at a baby fair we attended last year left us with a good impression of how I would be cared for during my pregnancy - it also became one of the deciding factors how we finally chose Thomson Medical Centre.

From the very beginning, Dr Ryan made everything smooth and manageable - he was easy to reach, always responsive, and most especially flexible with appointments, which made a huge difference throughout my pregnancy. Dr Ryan combines professionalism with a warm, reassuring approach that put my husband and me at ease. His thorough and genuine care throughout - both for me and my baby - made me feel confident and made this second pregnancy stress-free.

My family is very grateful for the experience we had under his care, as well as the support of his entire team at Thomson Specialists Woodleigh.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111993112864215074983/reviews
Yos Liman,5,"I couldn’t be more grateful to have had Dr. Ryan Lee as my OB-GYN throughout my pregnancy journey. From the very first consultation, he was incredibly attentive, patient, and knowledgeable. He always took the time to answer our questions, explained everything clearly, and made sure both my husband and I felt informed and supported every step of the way.

One thing that really stood out to us was how approachable and responsive he was—Dr. Lee is contactable via WhatsApp, and he always replied to our questions, no matter how big or small, with clarity and reassurance. This made us feel truly cared for and gave us peace of mind during those moments of uncertainty.

Dr. Lee has a calm and reassuring presence, which helped ease our anxiety, especially during the more challenging moments of labor and delivery. When complications arose and we had to proceed with an emergency C-section, he acted swiftly and confidently, ensuring both my safety and my baby’s. Thanks to his expertise and care, we welcomed a healthy baby boy into the world.

I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Ryan Lee to anyone looking for a dedicated, compassionate, and skilled OB-GYN. We’re so thankful for his support during one of the most important times in our lives.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111856900133393390721/reviews
