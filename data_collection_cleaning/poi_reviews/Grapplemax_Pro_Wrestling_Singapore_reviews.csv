grace li,5,"The instructors were really friendly and empowering. It was truly a safe space for all females to try new things! If you are a female but feel uncertain about trying this new sport, going for an all female class definitely helps!

Jennifer Liepin,5,"Grapple MaX Review

Thoughtful, patient, encouraging, and supportive, I am honored and grateful for Grapple Max to guide me as I take my first into learning how to engage in professional wrestling. Across my multiple pro wrestling basics classes, I have learned an incredible amount. This is thanks to the incredibly patient, thorough, and welcoming staff and classmates of this dojo.

Now, I know that some of you might be nervous to start a new sport, especially if you’re a bit older as I am. You want to make sure that you can indulge in this practice safely. No worries. Their team is constantly watching and correcting to ensure safety. As I’m a newbie, they were generous to give me extra time and plenty of eyes to guide me so I felt confident in the moves that I was performing. Notably, the class size is also fairly compact, so everyone can take multiple turns performing different moves and sequences.

While safety and movement are of focus, they also added a lot of guidance in terms of how to amp up one’s performance. I also learned a lot, simply watching my more experienced colleagues as they all have different styles and personalities to their wrestling personas. Every class is dually entertaining as both a participant and a performer.

I recommend this to everyone, whether you are simply an appreciator or an aspiring performer. Don’t be shy. You will be welcomed and supported in this team like atmosphere. Special shoutout to Sarah Coldheart, Lahrvin, and Greg, my preeminent instructors.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107459204527494230825/reviews
