      "text": "This company actually sells Bluewater ferry tickets. Avoid Bluewater AT ALL COSTS! Got stranded in Mersing because they sold too many tickets and the original boat was full, and we had no information on if or when another boat will be coming. I called them and emailed them dozens of time but nobody answered. We finally departed 1,5 hours late. On further consideration they were aware of the situation well beforehand but never even emailed us to inform. The boat is old, dirty, and the seats are very narrow. Completely unprofessional and unreliable. Cataferry is incredibly better.",

To return 2 days earlier as planned we were forced to buy new, additional tickets on the ferry even if this is inappropriate according to terms and conditions published on website. We got a reciepe after request only. Our inital tickets booked online were not refunded st all. As tourist I did not feel welcome. Sorry to say: Never again with bluewater.",

However, the seats are not enough, we have to sit outside with no aircond. On the way to Tioman Island, the ferry broke down for more than 1 hour before reaching Kg Genting Jetty. Hoping for improvement in the future.",
