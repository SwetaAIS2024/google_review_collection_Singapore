Flo Yeow,2,"I really don't like the vibes behind this mall. It almost feels like mini-Chinatown, with their messy states and low quality high quantity activities. Some low priced Chinese restaurants, a Chinese supermarket, some tuition centres, some beauty salons, and an Anytime Fitness gym.

To me it's the shops here, that draws the kind of crowds here, which makes the whole ambience feel messy and unexplainably stale.

Even though it's right by Clementi Mall, if I have no business here, I don't think I'll want to come and hang out here. There's no reason to, anyways.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
奪月 優,3,"It's OK but building seems abit rundown.
Scarlett supermarket just opened there which is great as they had variety of Chinese cooked food and snacks like potato balls.
Toilets need an upgrade too cramped especially at sink area.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106229036625964621134/reviews
Penny Song,1,"""Thank you for your response. However, I would like further clarification regarding the medication issue. I was prescribed Rosuvastatin 10mg every night by the pharmacist. Dr. Sim  adjusted my dosage from 5mg every other night to 5mg every night. Even in his letter to the polyclinic the dosage mentioned was still 5mg. Can you please clarify this discrepancy? I would appreciate a detailed explanation. Thank you.""",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111581178562288297357/reviews
Saifu Angto,4,"A small mall next to Clementi Mall and has a mix of shops - from employment agencies, restaurants, ice cream/dessert shops, etc.  The recent addition is the Ayam Penyet President which is pretty good and nice to be conveniently available in Clementi area.

Bus and MRT stops are just a few minutes walk away.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews

Amazing place",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117279516290197236406/reviews
