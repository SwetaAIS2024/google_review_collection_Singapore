Hartono Harjono,5,"Very spacious Giant supermarket, a one-stop-shop for all our daily needs. The store is open 24/7 and offers a wide range of products. Keep an eye out for promotions, but double-check prices during checkout as the system may have errors. If you notice any discrepancies, the staff is responsive to corrections. The service is straightforward â€“ pick up, pay, and collect. Don't expect a 5-star experience from the cashier; it's a supermarket, not an airline. There's also a Mr DIY store on the side. Highly recommended!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102944719141464210600/reviews
Yeo Janet,5,"Always have a pleasant shopping experience at this Giant supermarket. So spacious, clean, neat and hygienic, plus spoilt for choices and varieties in the merchandise.
Even the self check-out payment machines are so user-friendly.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116907173909621992546/reviews
C.C Quah,1,"This is 1 of my usual supermarkets. I would go for my weekly groceries. Most of the staff there who I have met and encountered are all pretty friendly, smiley, and helpful till I met a new cashier named Eileen? A Chinese lady with short hair. I was totally flabbergasted by her way of handling and the tone she spoke to us.

How will the customer know they need to tell the cashier upfront on the discount items or HOW MANY discount item they have chosen?? The tone and the way she spoke as though it was our mistake for not telling her upfront?? And keep telling us to separate the wet and dry.  Hello! Is not our job, right? We would be very happy and love to help a new cashier to separate wat is and wat not as well the wet and dry if only she ask with a polite tone. Be it with any job, lacking the most basic manner is really unacceptable.
Thank you for giving me and my friend such a memorable shopping experience and yes is my 1st time in my life ever met a cashier like that and I would definitely avoid at all cost just to prevent her from spoiling my good shopping day.
Sometimes, just 1 bad egg is enough to spoil the image of a company.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116254700547999874013/reviews
