Husband and wife team cooking.\nHad kway teow wanton with additional chicken feet. Char siew was so so,  chicken feet was well braised,  not to salty just nice. Sauce for kway teow was just nice.  Worried if it is too salty.  Soup was hot and tasted good with the few scallion added.  Overall,  can still revisit again.",

The dumplings are well packed with minced meat, prawns and water chestnut.  This sized up meal is only $6 with good amount of proteins and carbs and vegetables.",

      "text": "For me, one of the best wanton mee in Toa Payoh. Definitely the best dumplings: fat, juicy, packed with meat & prawns and most importantly water chestnut, making it crunchy. The noodles were airy and light but I prefer their kway teow. I don’t really like their char siew as they were too lean for me. I prefer charred, chunky fat char siew Hong Kong style. But then, the sauce and noodle made up for the it. It’s healthier too…",
