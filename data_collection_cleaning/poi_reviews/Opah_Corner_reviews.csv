Agnes Francis,5,I was greeted by the older aunty sitting near her stall. So nice to feel welcome. I bought nasi lemak chicken chop today for $5. The tastiest I've ever had. It was so yummy. Sambal was also tasty. Love it.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107735218500147376038/reviews
N,5,"Ordered this on foodpanda and it's the most affordable option I've ever seen. Thank you! Where else can you find affordable nasi sambal goreng, lontong, mee rebus in Singapore?

Reviewers want to complain about the taste when they couldn't afford something better. I'm pretty sure the food was what you could only afford and the most convenient for you, hence you opted to buy it at that point of time.

You want high quality nasi lemak you go restaurant and spend more. You want cheapest nasi lemak you go and travel to ananas. Make your reviews make sense before you write.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100985347480806073484/reviews
Ember Shen,2,"Worse than ananas cafe.

The rice was clumpy, no coconut flavour, and too much.

Can use cdc vouchers

$5 for this is not worth it",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117465885711011307889/reviews
Rini Kartini,5,"Traditional nasi lemak comfort food in a heartland area! They have other varieties such as mee siam, mee soto, mee rebus. Also, they have super good chendol in a take-away cup which is a plus point. Open daily except on Sundays.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105373841660083087417/reviews
Oreoo Lover,1,"This could be the worst nasi lemak i have ever had. Tasteless and sticky rice, fish fillet that taste like flour with very gross texture, missed out ikan bilis, asked for a little more sambal but the makcik asked: “how much you want? Want extra need to pay hor”. I don’t usually give google review but i really have to do it for this.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114115335298726266327/reviews
