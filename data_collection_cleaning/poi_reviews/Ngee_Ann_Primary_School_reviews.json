      "text": "School has extremely strong emphasis on grades and PSLE. Therefore by sending your kids here, it would value add them to do well in PSLE.\n\nValues like hard work, discipline and perseverance is strongly reinforced in the curriculum, with a robust desire to push students to study, especially for P5 and P6 classes. This would be even more apparent if you are in the top 2 classes. Teachers allocated to graduating batches would also be of those who are immune to and have immense expertise in guiding graduating batches of students. All these academic values instilled in me from P5 to P6 at a super young age has helped me gone far in secondary school, where students will later face another set of challenges.\n\nApart from that, the school provides a lot of opportunity to help students grow holistically. However then again, your child must be expected to speak up and talk to teachers privately if he/she wants to find out more about events/leadership roles/ccas to grow holistically :).\n\nAll in all an extremely ideal school to put your child in if you strongly believe in academic excellence.",
