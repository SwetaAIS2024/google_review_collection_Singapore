Derine Tan,5,"Had a really great experience with Dr. Xiang Jun! The first time I saw her, I had a sprained neck, and it was completely cleared up after just one session. Super thankful to her for helping me get back to my normal routine so quickly.

Went back again today for a sprained back—was in so much pain I could barely walk, bend, or turn. Her acupuncture skills are amazing. After the session, I could actually move without pain! She advised me to take it easy and give it time to heal, so fingers crossed it’ll feel even better after some rest tomorrow. Really appreciate her care and expertise!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100714792686570068932/reviews
Lauren Yen,5,"I visited Dr Xiang Jun for my psoriasis. I’ve struggled with flair ups for almost 20 years and just after first few treatments flair ups have subsided and existing patches were already beginning to fade. She also addressed stress/sleep related issues, which I began feeling after just first session. Very knowledgeable and thorough. I would encourage others considering TCM to see her!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107740359871994327436/reviews

Derrence Lim,5,"Dr Xiang Jun did a great job. I’ve been suffering from Bell’s palsy years. He initial doctor did a great job balancing my face but there was remnants.

He tried to treat it but never went away so I gave up for 3 years. But January 2025 I decided to give it another chance. I found Dr Xiang on Google and went to try my luck.
