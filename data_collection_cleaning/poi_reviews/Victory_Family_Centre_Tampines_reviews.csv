Faith Sim,5,VFC is definitely a great church to be part of. A church that really spurs and helps one another to grow spiritually. A church which is chill and not very strict about a lot of things. Pastors and leaders who are very understanding. Definitely have my ups and down here but I have no regret joining this church but still very thankful to be part of the community.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113694738529048520753/reviews
