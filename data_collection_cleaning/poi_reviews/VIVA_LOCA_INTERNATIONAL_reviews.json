Still no proper calculations of happy hour and non happy hour orders. I saw no proper order management. Bit careful on what you order\n\nRest.. Spacious chill out space,Indo Chinese food,  drinks and live band to enjoy late night\n\nRecently again in 2024 Jan/Feb, ordered chicken tikka, buffalo wings.. not properly coocked, smelly and hard. Informed and replaced with something else... Be careful  food quality and bill",

I have never had this unpleasant experience as a customer willing to spend quality time with a friend. We ordered a bottle of wine and were served an unopened bottle with 2 glasses!! Yes, we both rolled our eyes and were surprised by the mistreatment here as a customer. We ordered 2 glasses of water, which wasn‚Äôt served after we reminded the same waiter after 30 mins. Well, without any surprises, yes, there isn‚Äôt any apology. I believe that the owner and the manager don‚Äôt believe in customer service. Otherwise, why were there so many posted unpleasant experiences here?",
