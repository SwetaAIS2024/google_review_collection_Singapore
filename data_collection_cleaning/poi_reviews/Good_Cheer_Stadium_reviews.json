I can notice a few little holes on the pool cloth and wearing off at the cushions. Please kindly request your boss for a table cloth change if possible Esther (manager). üôèüôèüôè.

But more than an hour before closing, about 1230, everyone in the room can smell the aroma of air-fried food. After asking the staff, it's their \"staff snack\" before closing apparently?? If its so easy to just air fry some snacks, why couldn't you do it for paying customers?",
