Ruby,5,"Repeated customer, have been coming here since last year, with sister and friends. Amazing massage and amazing people even though its like under block and not the high class end massage looking parlour. Favourite masseuse would be Lela, Baby and Julia, they listen to every concern you have in order to relieve pain and help body aches. Truly recommended. Did massage, foot reflexology and even cupping. Very affordable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116982280268995151906/reviews

batman roger,1,"I requested for someone who knows how to do a proper shoulder massage for me but ended up receiving one of the worst massages I had in my life. Had a very poor masseuse who knows nothing about removing knots from shoulders and did a sloppy job. Told the masseuse which part of my body needed more massage but she kept on pressing other areas. Unless you know the specific masseuse here, don‚Äôt waste your money here. There‚Äôs no proper ic here to attend to you and hear your feedback. Toilet is disgusting too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101329094102696871713/reviews
