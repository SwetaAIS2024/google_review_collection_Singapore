Parita Chitakasem,2,"I came here to browse but did not buy anything as the items are a little old, random and do not seem to be of great quality. The place is similar to Daiso, although the items are more expensive and probably not even as good quality and not as much choice as Daiso.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102356148454609478796/reviews
Mansi G,1,"Most items at this store are very old and in bad condition. It's a waste of a massive retail prime space. Has close to none visitors given the items are not even priced cheap. Competitors such as daisoband shoppee are selling far cheaper and better quality products. Owner should consider letting go of old inventory online (such as at shoppee / lazada) in bulk deal discounts and consider taking a franchise such as miniso, daiso .. etc",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108211924825390742934/reviews
Rose Atienza,1,Bought a cable here only for me to bring it home and realise it is not working at all. It is indeed cheap but buying unusable stuffs isn’t really worth it.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102211709121377250756/reviews
