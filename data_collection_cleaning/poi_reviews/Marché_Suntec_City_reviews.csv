Kai,3,"The prices have gone up tremendously. It was quite a heftly sum for dinner.

Food was alright. Remembered that portions used to be more value for money.

Taste:
Chicken schnitzel 4/5
Pork knuckle 4/5
Beef stew 3/5
Minced beef pizza 1/5 (Too plain and tasteless)
Rosti 4/5
Mushroom ragout 5/5",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103961412486889059100/reviews
Potato Head,3,"Very good place to go with small kids.
They have small kids play ground and monitor outside to watch them.
Some how always entrants staff were very unkind.
Hope they can work more happy face.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113658781384736931614/reviews
preba moodley,3,"Marché Mövenpick at Suntec City offers a unique dining experience with its European market-style concept, featuring live cooking stations and a diverse selection of fresh dishes. The restaurant provides a cozy and vegan friendly environment, making it a suitable choice for various dietary preferences.  ￼ ￼

While the ambiance and variety are commendable, some patrons have noted that the pricing can be on the higher side, which might limit the ability to sample multiple dishes.  ￼

Overall, Marché Mövenpick at Suntec City is a great spot for those seeking a relaxed atmosphere and a range of fresh, live-prepared meals, though it’s advisable to be mindful of the pricing.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115440708151553111297/reviews
Jacelyn,4,"Went on a weekend at 5.30pm and the services are so slow. Have to wait 15 min each for my drink, dessert and grilled salmon. I had to keep going back to the station to check if the drink and food are ready as it is really taking too long. The resturant is understaff as our table is full of finished dishes and piling up but no one came to clear it and there hardly any space for us. However the food especially the crepe wrap is very nice. Love there variety of food to choose from but will be better if there are pictures to show what do the dishes looks.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111010667983647437264/reviews
Lim Jaspar,1,"Aircon, mall. Comfortable and fancy looking, but definitely quality has dropped drastically. 1 star because food is the main, and is severely bad. Ordered beef steak. Took a long time before my order was called. My first bite was the beef is not even remotely warm. As if they had it done long ago, and forgot to inform. The meat is cooked to medium which is what I asked for. However the cut is poor and 1/4 of the entire steak is unchewable fats and nerves. If I had to swallow those, I choke. Mashed potato is dry and stiff, and inedible without the sauce. At this point, the 4 cherry tomatoes are tastiest on the plate. Never again am I going to Marche, not for this price, not for my calories. I would even think twice paying $12.90 rather than the actual $32.90 for this crap. If not for my proteins requirements for the day, I would not even finish the beef steak. Terrible",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115142463215299263560/reviews
