L. HF,1,"I am extremely dissatisfied with my experience attending a course with the training provider Hustle @ Somerset. The process has been frustrating and poorly managed. The course was supposed to be supported under the SFEC claims scheme, but Hustle only issued the invoice to our company on the first day of the class. Shockingly, by the second day, we were stopped at the counter and not allowed to attend the session due to non-payment.

To make matters worse, the submission for the SFEC claim took two full weeks to be processed. The delay and lack of clear communication with the salesperson caused unnecessary stress and disrupted the learning experience. This has left me feeling very disappointed with both their professionalism and service.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105186675478306229911/reviews
Steven Vakkali Tham,5,"Ideal location, comfortable learning spaces, easy to access... I enroll to take up an acrylic painting class over 3 Sundays. The experience has been fun, fruitful & memorable. Admin staff Jasmine & Josephine are most helpful to ensure learners are well informed of course commencement. Painting materials & tools are provided in class, with a specially curated tote bag with painting equipment presented on Day 1. I look forward to my final Sunday class this coming weekend",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100100613043871550189/reviews
