Clement Toh,3,"Ordered XO Fish Meat (fried) Bee Hoon Soup, Prawn Paste Crispy Chicken and Furong Omelette. The fish broth could be thicker and the XO taste could come through more. Personally prefer Holland Village XO Fish Head Bee Hoon (Dover).",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115238226850994285010/reviews
Tiong wee Wong,3,"I recently visited Holland Village XO Fish Head Bee Hoon and had a mixed experience. The sliced fish bee hoon soup was quite disappointing. The broth was bland, and the vegetables tasted raw, with only a slight hint of XO flavor. It lacked the richness and depth I was expecting.
On a brighter note, the sambal potato leaves were a highlight. They were well-cooked and flavorful, providing a nice contrast to the otherwise underwhelming soup. The prawn paste chicken was decent, with a good texture and taste, but nothing extraordinary.
Overall, while there were some enjoyable dishes, the experience was not particularly memorable. I hope they can improve the quality of their signature dishes",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102748965154843660001/reviews
Jeroemy,4,"Visited a couple of times. This place has been around for over 20 years. Their XO fish bee hoon is good, and you can indicate how many pax for a portion size.

They don’t have the biggest Zhi Char menu since they are more specialised, but as sides I believe the prawn paste chicken & prawn rolls are decent!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113002867544321957411/reviews
SJM,1,"I used to have their fish soup every now and then, but their consistently terrible service finally pushed me to write this review. If you order just one portion, expect to receive only one set of utensils and sauce - ask for more, and you’ll get scolded.

I get that they want to cut costs, but there’s a way to communicate it politely. Instead, they’re always rude, not just to me but to my whole family. We’ve had enough and won’t be returning.

To the shop owner - keep up the poor service, and it’s only a matter of time before your business shuts down. I won’t be surprised when it happens.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107121592848948017447/reviews
Daniel,3,"Takeaway meal for 5 pax.

The attached photos are partially eaten and does not represent the quantity of good when you order.

Ordered the following.

1. Sam Lo Horfun
2. Prawn Paste Chicken
3. Fried Prawn Roll (Hae Cho)
4. Broccoli with Prawns

Sam Lo Horfun had a little wok-hei. Tastes bland with almost no seasoning. This can be subjective as some people like it non-salty, this is it. For a Large, it is actually more like Medium at other Zichar stalls which I ate recently from Alexandra Village.

Prawn Paste Chicken. Only the mid wings, no drumetes or wing tips. Compared to other Zichar stalls, the number of midwings is a little underwhelming for a Medium.

Fried Prawn Roll (Hae Cho)
Tasted very commerical with a lot of flour just like those Ngo Hiang stalls. Skip this dish.

Broccoli with Prawns. The prawns tasted fresh and crunchy.

Portions here are smaller compared to other zichar stalls.

Not really recommended unless you are very hungry and have no other options.

I recommend cheap and good across the road...Johnson Duck. New stall and very different from other Johnson Duck stalls.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100196593170329614557/reviews
