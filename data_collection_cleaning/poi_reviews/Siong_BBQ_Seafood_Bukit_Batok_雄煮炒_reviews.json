There are blocks of residential coming up, so I do expect the dining crowd to increase with time.\n\nThe salted egg calamari was nice- flavourful and fried to golden crisp. Stingray was alright, the sambal lacked a punch. Portion of rice was good.\n\nOverall, if you live nearby, this would be an option for family meals.",

I also enjoyed their fresh fried fish options, which were a great accompaniment to rice.\n\nThe classic Cai Po Beancurd and the flavorful Prawn Paste Fried Chicken were delicious additions to my meal.",
