Dr Florence is very professional and friendly, and the casual chat with her fully eased my anxiety before we start the procedure. The whole process was fast and smooth, and I‚Äôm not feeling painful at all. Also want to say thanks the staffs I met today receptionist Laura and nurse Diyannah for their kind assistances and patient explanations. Will definitely revisit here in future!",
