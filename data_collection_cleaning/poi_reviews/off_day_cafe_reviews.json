We tried the English Breakfast and Strawberry Bubble Waffle ‚Äî both were delicious! Their other desserts also looked really cute and tempting.\n\nDo support this lovely place!",

      "text": "Lovely, tranquil cafe. Food was tasty and portions were pretty big. Very interesting and creative menu too!\n\nTried the Hainanese chicken risotto which was really good! Lots of textures and flavour in the dish. If there‚Äôs any feedback, it‚Äôll only be that it was slightly on the saltier side. But still yummy nonetheless!\n\nOD breakfast was HUGE and delicious. Hash brown was cooked nice and crispy! Again, food was on the saltier side but it might just be a personal preference.\n\nShashouka‚Äôs taste and visual was more towards a thicker version of minestrone soup.",

The strawberry egglet looks good and that's it. For the price point, I would have expected better quality cream and more strawberries. Egglet was crispy but it lacked aroma and taste.\n\nTiramisu slaps. Cream was light, not overtly sweet and hint of savoury (from the Mascarpone), coffee was good. Texture can be better if they can consider layering the cake with a bit more cream in between.\n\nCoffee is decent.",

We enjoyed the avocado bagel, please kindly try it if you plan to eat there. The matcha was just nice. However, we felt that the service was lacking a bit. Example, they forgot to serve us the burnt cheesecake until we reminded them. Hopefully the service is better the next time we go. Environment is pretty chill. You can definitely get some work done here.",

Between the Black Forest cake and the burnt cheesecake we much enjoyed the latter.\n\nThey offered a special latte for Christmas and it was one of the better coffees I‚Äôve had.",
