Matt Yazer,5,"1 one the best outlet, spacious space, very clean floor, fast service. I tried level 5 spiceness and it's burning me inside n outside, very best experience to ate level 5. Once on a lifetime go try the level 5 spice I dare you",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100348811894655993780/reviews
Din Saint,5,"Clean and spacious air-conditioned fast food outlet. Food tastes about average for any fast food chains. Their speciality would be the Fire Chicken. It has 5 levels of spiciness that can be requested upon order. For reference, the level 2 for those that dislike spicy food, is way off the charts. Their beef burger tastes exactly the same as Macdonald's cheese burger. The buns are soft and Patty tender. Their drinks of pink guava and yogurt tea are quite refreshing and not too sweet.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111695026081785780047/reviews

ani mahadi,4,This branch just open 2 days ago and they got aome combo promotion. We tried the hot chicken (level 2) and non spicy one. They have level 0-5 for the spiciness. If you dont eat spicy food please just try level 0 or 1. For level 2 its already makes my mouth full of fire üòÇ We also try the air bandung drinks and ice cream.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117016235871556295112/reviews
