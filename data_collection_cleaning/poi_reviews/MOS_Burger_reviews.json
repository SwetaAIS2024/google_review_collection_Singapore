I ordered an ice tea today and it came with 2 pods of creamer. Obviously i would have needed a stirrer. I asked your staff serving the food (pink shirt), for one, her response to me was, \"we don't have stirrers, you just open the cover, pour in the creamer and mix it by shaking your drink.\" üò≥ really, MOS? this is your level of service? I've been here a couple of times, i've clearly asked for stirrers before and have gotten it each time. I then walked out to the front counter and asked a lady in green for a stirrer and she provided me with one. So why was it so difficult to provide your customers for one in the first place? Do better, MOS.",
