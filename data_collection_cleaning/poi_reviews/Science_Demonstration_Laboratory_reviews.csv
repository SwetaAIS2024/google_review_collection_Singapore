Ivan Tan,5,"Great place to destress, make new friends and science communicators. Enjoy partaking in meaningful co curriculum activities here while studying and researching. This is a homely environment with a large family of science communicators and alumnis who will give you opportunities to try out facilitating and planning workshop contents from the various disciplines of science. Lots of constructive feedbacks exchanged among us. Great opportunities to explore my creative talents by getting my hands dirty in them. Primary and secondary Schools come to the science museum too for learning journey under the most experienced science communicators.

Less one star coz there is limited opportunities to visit science center to enjoy science better. Nay I just kidding. Will rate it 5 stars for the most homely, supportive and forgiving environment. They forgive me for the many mistakes I make in school

No interview and selection is required to join this awesome family",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116315853954232917392/reviews
