Darren Cheong,4,"Nasi Briyani Mutton $7sgd

The mutton cuts are good, making it easy to chew and not too tough.

The bastamit rice isnâ€™t very flavorful and fragrance  but the portion size is generous. The salad could use some improvement.

The sauce was okay, and there was no egg included. Overall, the price and portion are the deciding factor for 4stars

making it an economical option for mutton biryani in the Punggol area, in my opinion",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136407063098297690/reviews
KKT,4,"Biryani rice not bad.
Fried prawn not just fried so, as it is..
Curry sauce salty but tasty, strong taster like me ok.
Rojak also nice, I guess usually fresh fried won't go wrong.

Came all the way here to try tulang but no stock. Staff is friendly when letting me know.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews

Stephen Kagawa,5,Most of the Roti canai is nice! fried rice also worth to try. Food price is reasonable. The only stall that open until 11pm. A place for supper if you hungry at night :),a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116888108318387454461/reviews
Maria Katarina,4,"I odered GRAB for a Saturday  dinner-  roti pisang with fish curry and biryani with chicken masala. Haven't been moved to put up a review for some time but for this, I will.
The roti pisang was not fluffy and a bit hard, but the fish curry was thick and flavourful. I also like the tasty and  flavourful biryani rice and masala chicken.
Definitely a keeper and a gem!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111999981457472659328/reviews
