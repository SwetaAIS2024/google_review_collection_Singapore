Sushis were fresh and steak was on the chewier side.\n\nService was a little slow, with an item being missed out, but the servers were quite friendly, which made up for the entire experience.\n\nOverall would recommend if around the area :)",

I understand that the restaurant may not have enough kitchen staff but what the manager should have done then is to not accept reservations past a certain number. Their staff were over whelmed and it wasn’t even 100% occupied. Some tables cancelled part of their orders and left.  The 2 waitresses were trying their best but unfortunately, they had to deal with the situation.",
