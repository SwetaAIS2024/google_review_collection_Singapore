Had the Whole snapper which was quite well cooked for most part except for certain portions which were just a tad bit overcooked; The sauce that went with it was nice as well.\n\nBeef was cooked to medium rare; Generally nice and juicy. Service was great and food didn‚Äôt take too long to come. Wouldn‚Äôt mind coming back here because of the ambience and the pretty good tasting grilled meats.",

      "text": "Overview: Grill restaurant serving steaks, seafood and other western mains located at Keppel Bay with both indoor and outdoor seating overlooking the harbour.\n\nPros‚úÖ: Lunch set menu is good value for money; 2-courses for $28 and 3-courses for $32. Service was also great by our server Rocky. Great ambience and location. Offered free bread at the beginning which was great added value and desserts stood out for me and the sea bass main.\n\nCons‚ùå: A-la-carte menu is much more expensive and i‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs not worth the price so highly recommend going for the lunch menu instead. The seafood pasta also was not the best as the tomato sauce didn‚Äôt seem cooked from scratch from fresh tomatoes and seafood didn‚Äôt seem that fresh and the dish was a bit watery in general.\n\nRecommended dishes:\nüêüPan fried seabass\nüç©Cinnamon doughnuts with coconut sorbet and grilled pineapple\nüçãPassionfruit tart",
