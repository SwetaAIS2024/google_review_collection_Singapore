      "text": "Jin Ming Noodle Stall sells a variety of noodles at Block 29.\n\nWent there in a Sunday morning and the queue for Bak Choe Mee was long. Took about 15 minutes before my order was taken and another 5 minutes for my noodles.\n\nOrdered a Bak Chor Mee with Mee Kia and the cheapest price was $4.50.\n\nThe Bak Chor Mee came al dente with chilli and the vinegar taste was slight. Could see the variety of ingredients making the noodles worth the price. Comes with 2 dumplings (one boiled and one fried), one large pig liver, minced meat, sliced pork, anchovies and one meat ball. A few pieces of flat fish was also added. The ingredients were not too over cooked and the pig liver was still tender.\n\nOverall, the taste of the noodles was slightly above average but nothing too fantastic. The wait time may be a put off as well.",

      "text": "Came to this coffeeshop quite a few time for dinner and always noticed this particular stall selling noodle which is closed in the evening. Happened to be around the neighborhood during lunchtime, decided to pop by to try my luck to see if they are operating.  Thank god i noticed that their signboard was lighted as I stepped into the coffeeshop. there was any queue when i reached there. The stall was operated by an elderly couple. Apart from the minced meat noodle, they also sell a variety of other noodle.\n\nOrdered their minced meat noodle which was SGD$5. Noodle was nicely cooked, texture of noodle was springy. Sauce was a little too watery and the ketchup taste might be too overpowering for some. The bowl of noodle came with ingredients like 2 kind of wantons, meatball, fried fishball, sliced liver and lean pork.  Quite value for money if you asked me.\n\nWould come back in the future to try their lasksa or lormee,",
