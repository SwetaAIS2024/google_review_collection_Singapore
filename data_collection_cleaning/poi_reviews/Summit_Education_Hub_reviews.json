We love the Personalised Q&A Support! She is always timely with her reply and clear in her written explanation. Her Science tips helped us to grasp the concept fast. Her handouts and notes are so easy to understand too. Irregardless of the end result, we would like to say a big THANK YOU for all your help, patience & guidance. We would definitely recommend you‚ò∫Ô∏è From: Mummy of AY",

Explanations and tips given were elaborated yet clear. The online videos gave us options to replay at our convenient time and our own pace. The Q&A support is amazing as teacher Kelle responds within the day and she is thorough in her explanation. I will definitely recommend students who are struggling with science to try out the online classes.",

Her lessons are to the point, tips are 5-‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê worth and easy to understand/absorb. Answering Science Paper open-ended questions has always been a struggle. But just after 3 hours of exam booster sessions with Teacher Kelle, my son now knows exactly how to answer different questions on condensation/evaporation questions, circuit questions w 4Cs, plants reproductive system to name a few....  with much more confidence. Wow! Impressive!! Thank you Teacher Kelle! üëèüèªüëçüèªüôèüèª\n\nWe are certainly going to enrol Tyler for P6 Science 2025 class with Kainetik.",
