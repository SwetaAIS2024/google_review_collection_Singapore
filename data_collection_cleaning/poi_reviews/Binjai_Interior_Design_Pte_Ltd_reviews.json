When confronted, she say give wrong price and after probing, she say we wasting her time when she could be doing her work.\n-Not a one time moment as she decided to tried to pull another stunt on me again for a chair with 65% markup from quote.\n(Just Imagine what she can do to you if you find her to do interior design)\n-Its a sale but when negotiation about price take place, she refuse to lower any price.",
