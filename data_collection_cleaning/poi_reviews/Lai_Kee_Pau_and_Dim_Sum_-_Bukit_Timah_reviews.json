      "text": "I always thought affordable neighborhood dim sum places don't exist anymore, and then I stumbled upon Lai Kee.\n\nIt's a small dim sum place (restaurant would be too grand a word) in Toh Yi HDB estate. The space is tight but tidy, and I admire them for providing such an extensive menu of dim sum items, noodles and drinks at such affordable prices while not being inside a hot crowded food court. Service was prompt and friendly. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Is this the best dim sum I've tried in my life? Clearly no! But for the price I paid and the neighborhood vibes (you see aunties catching up with friends, uncles reading Straits Times), I will gladly be back again.",

And she was talking with the guy next to her and touching a stationary next to her, all while pinching my kueh. This is totally unhygienic in my view and when i looked at her....she sheepishly stopped touching the stationary. Whey....how can you do that, even though i know the kueh will evebtually be boiled in water? Probably wouldnt patronise this shop moving forward. A pity.... hygiene issue",
