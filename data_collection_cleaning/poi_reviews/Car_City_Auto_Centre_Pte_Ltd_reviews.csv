ìž¥sonya,5,"When I applied for the service, I was impressed with the service of bringing a rental car to my house and taking the car .  It was a hassle to pay attention to car repairs in the midst of being busy, but it helped so much.  A person named Ninja was in charge, and he kindly explained and proceeded with each step.  Next time I have another repair job, I'll go to car city.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114786728797361453596/reviews
