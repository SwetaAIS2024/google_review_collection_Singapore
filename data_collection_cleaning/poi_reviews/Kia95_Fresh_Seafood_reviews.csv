Cheryl Lee,5,"The wanton soup is nice, rest of stalls were not open when i went there at 5+pm.
Had the western food as well, sausage was so so but fries was freshly cooked and crispy!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107813037784059923389/reviews
John Koh,5,"Found this gem of a hawker center. Good breakfast selection and good choice of drinks stalls like teh tarik and old school breakfast like Chee Cheong Fun, Economic bee hoon and famous “Only One -Laksa”. Next to the hawker there is a Tanglin Halt roti prata looking good too. Parking is limited. Was attracted here by the old school peanut cake but they only open selected day. Better luck next time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103447327229500686102/reviews
Matthew Lee,4,A true little gem of the west. A place to go for breakfast and be sure to be there early with lots of queuing if you wanna try the peanut pancake and the laksa. Pancake for me was really worth the queue but the laksa gravy was not thick enough for my liking. The lor mee has no queue and I think its pretty worth a try. Chee cheong fun was OK and average.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109397825257995094119/reviews
