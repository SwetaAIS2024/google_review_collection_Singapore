I shop here regularly because the quality is consistently outstanding. You can truly taste the difference, and it’s reassuring to know exactly where your food comes from.

The staff is fantastic too — always welcoming, knowledgeable, and happy to help. Whether you’re shopping for daily basics or special ingredients, they make the whole experience smooth and enjoyable.

Jill Tan,5,"I just want to say a very Big Thank you, to Miss Eva, Tanglin Mall Branch. She noted that I came down twice, (yesterday & today) to get the reusable Kegtop dispenser, but the stock had not been delivered yet. She called me, during her break & took the initiative to make delivery arrangements, for the items, to be delivered to my home, today. She told me ""I dont want to see you, being disappointed."" Thank you so much, Miss Eva! You made my birthday, extra special, this year! You are a gem!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105008376535412719989/reviews
LiV3 LiFe,3,"Little Farms Market at Tanglin Mall is not just any other grocery stores. It has imported many groceries from countries such as Australia, Italy - fresh, frozen, wine. It is very interesting but be prepared to pay a higher price than from the country itself. It would be a good indulgence from time to time no matter. Cashier Staff are average - they do their due diligence of asking if a plastic bag is required. Overall, it is ok.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112429413622143366667/reviews
