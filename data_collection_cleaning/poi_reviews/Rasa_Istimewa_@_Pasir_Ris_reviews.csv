Marc Singh,4,"not great but definitely decent food, with very good service! i feel the flavours could be stronger and bolder, but not really complaining because the portions are huge, we couldn’t finish our food and had to takeaway. at the price point, it’s definitely very worth it!

the nonya fish was the star dish, it
was very tasty! we ordered two different fried rice and both were pretty good. as someone who likes spicy, i definitely had to add sambal. would love to come back and try the other items!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111474566471418870196/reviews
jeanette sea,4,"We were there about 12pm on Mothers' Day.  After recent renovation the place is bright and spacious with generous aircon & al fresco seating.
A good crowd filled the place while waiting for our food, small & big families, and the noise became too loud for chatting.
Two of us ordered 2 plates of rice, a small plate of spicy assam sotong,  s small hotplate seafood tofu & a small kungpo chicken.
The sotong was overcooked though a good balance of sourness and spiciness. The seafood hotplate tofu came with the usual mushroom, peas and carrot.  However the sliced fish tasted too earthy, and sotong also too tough.  The few prawns were crunchy.  The kungpo chicken came with a few cashew nuts (which nowadays are usu. Left out).  The rice portion is small.

All in all the dishes taste okay and balanced.  Prices are reasonable and environment pleasant. There's ample parking available.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116123352848619554989/reviews
Clarence Ow,5,"Located near the entrance of Pasir Ris park, this Halal certified Zi Char restaurant is surprisingly good. The prices are also very much decent.

The restaurant is spacious with plenty of seats. The interior is well air conditioner, could be slightly cold.

Hotplate beef is delicious. Very comfortable style of cooking and authentic ingredients.

Sambal stingray is also pleasant. Alot of meat and the sambal is great.

Overall, could be a highly frequented place if you live near.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112234615480628100933/reviews
Rahul K,4,"We where riding in Pasir Ris Park and stopped for impromptu dinner for two. The sliced fish in ginger was fresh fish fillets. The veg kuay teow was yummy and generous.

We will be back!

PS. This place is on the MUIS website halal certification.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118130333702049544071/reviews
