      "text": "I have been seeing Dr. Dennis since end Dec 2023 mainly for persistent giddiness (due to upper cervical issues) and aches along my shoulders and upper back; and have seen both relief and alleviated symptoms following appropriate treatment on a weekly basis. Dr. Dennis uses integrated treatment methods, which incorporates acupuncture, TCM massage and oral medicine which works best in synergy. He also very kindly takes his time with his patients, I don’t feel rushed (which is  my pain point with other TCM clinics). Looking forward to feeling better under Dr. Dennis continued care!",

      "text": "I had been battling chronic back pain from years of office work, coupled with persistent numbness in my arm for months. Despite consulting a GP, the relief I sought remained elusive. Fortunately, I stumbled upon this TCM clinic and decided to give it a try, a decision that proved to be life-changing.\n\nAfter just a few acupuncture sessions, under the skilled hands of Dennis, the numbness in my arm disappeared, providing me with immense relief. Additionally, my chronic back pain, which had been a constant companion for years, significantly eased.\n\nDennis not only demonstrated profound expertise in acupuncture, spine manipulative therapy but also exhibited a compassionate and patient-centered approach. He took the time to understand my specific concerns and tailored the treatment accordingly.\n\nThe overall experience has been nothing short of exceptional. I am immensely grateful to Dennis for helping me regain a quality of life that I thought was lost to chronic pain. I highly recommend giving this clinic a try.",

Thankful and Very much appreciated for Dr Tay’s skills. Have been to another TCM before but wasn’t able to solve my husband’s issue and thus, Thankful to get to know Dr Tay from my mom. He may be young but he’s so knowledgeable and skilful and yes super friendly! Highly recommended to anyone who needs to find a TCM physician.",
