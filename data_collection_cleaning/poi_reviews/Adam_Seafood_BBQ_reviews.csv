YP Soo,4,"Repeated visit for their BBQ dishes. Would usually order their leather jacket grilled fish and their stir fry Kai Lan.

Love that dried shrimps are added in the stir fry Kai Lan elevating that umami-ness.

Ordered their sambal sotong - excellent doneness; sotong not overly cooked, nice bite to it.

Love their chinchalok which compliments the sambal seafood.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107739220722281476081/reviews

CK C,2,"Uncle was friendly and sent the order to our table. Unfortunately, the food was rather disappointing. The belachan of the stingray was too sweet, and tasted like it contained ketchup. The kangkong was well fried but was extremely salty. Everything served in disposables.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
