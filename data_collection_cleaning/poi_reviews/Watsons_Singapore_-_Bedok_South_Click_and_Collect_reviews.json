      "text": "This morning, I headed to my neighborhood watsons to refund a set of tissues(2 for 8.90) as they were defective(there were two boxes that were lighter than the others). When the cashier opened them, they were half filled. I did not want to refund for the same set of tissues as I was afraid that it would have the same defect and  asked to refund for a cheaper one(2 for 8.50). However, I was then requested to pay an extra 4.50 despite the decrease in value. Throughout the entire exchange, the cashier was extremely unpleasant and did not once apologize for the mistake on watsons part. Iâ€™ve been a consistent customer at this franchise for many years and have left a highly disappointed in their service and product quality. Would not recommend buying their tissues if you are given a choice.",
