Loki,5,"Quiet little cafe hidden deep within level 10 of Orchard Central. Nice place for some peace and quiet or to do some work. Do note that there are no windows here and lighting can be a bit dim/glum. Coffee is strong, power plugs available.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101937176024039442948/reviews
Michelle L,3,"A really quiet cafe located at level 10 of Orchard Central. Staff were attentive, however the food was really below average - we didnâ€™t finish it as it wasnâ€™t really nice. However for the price of $14.90 as a set - Main, Drink & Soup of the Day, located at Orchard, You canâ€™t really expect much. Although itâ€™s a great place for you to do your work!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118428053350836615628/reviews
Bryan Tay,5,"Food was great and portion sufficient. Meal includes a drink and soup. Service staff were very friendly. Thai- fusion food by authentic Thai chefs.

No service charge. Proceeds also go to a charity so itâ€™s for a good cause.

There were also event spaces around for rental, including an auditorium! Unique space. Will definitely come back",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117707930732872803746/reviews
Jolynn Sge,3,"Went with 3 friends on a Monday afternoon. The ambience was great and it was quiet enough for us to have a good catch up.
However, 3 out of 4 main courses that we've ordered....were pretty disappointing ðŸ˜” Item 06 on the menu, Stir-fried Minced Chicken with Basil Leaves, Fried Egg & Rice had better taste and portion as compared to the rest that we've ordered.
When making payment, the staff asked how was the food - I truthfully feedback that it can be better, so was the portion.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101233971912671513227/reviews
