Her kimchi fried rice and gimbap are unmatched. She also has a special dish each week so please follow her on Instagram! You can even place large orders through social media or WhatsApp.\n\nThe location is green, comfortable, and quiet. You can grab a coffee around the corner after you are done. May's smile is just as warm as her food! This is a most welcome spot in this neighborhood, please try for yourself!",
