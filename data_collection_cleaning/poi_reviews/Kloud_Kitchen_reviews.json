The hijab lady at the counter was inattentive, very arrogant, and showed lack of respect to me yesterday, despite the fact that I had been their frequent customer for almost about 1.5 years. The waiting time/queue is quite long (took almost an hour), the halal food is not nice, and the customer service is VERY BAD (well below average). Overall, I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone (even Malays and Muslims). I am very disappointed and will not bother to visit this restaurant again ever. It's not worth trying !!",
