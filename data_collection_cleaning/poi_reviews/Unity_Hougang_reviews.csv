Barbette Strauss,5,"This is a small unity outlet located within the premises of fair price finest at Hougang street 21.  Although there is no pharmacists available at the branch, the pharmacy has a good variety of supplements, over-the-counter medication and other peripherals.  An elderly aunty serves as a one-man-show in managing the pharmacy and she is doing a very decent job.  Very approachable, friendly, hardworking and professional.  She would always try to help customers with their inquiries on products and is always seen stocking up products and cleaning the shelves.  By far, all their products seemed to be fresh with expiry dates that are at least 2-3 years away from the current period.  Highly recommended!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116995110127835257886/reviews
