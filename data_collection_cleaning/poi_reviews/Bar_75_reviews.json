Singapore pricing is a bit steep but that’s … Singapore.\n\nFood options are limited late but available late which is better than the Jewel which closes too early.\n\nWould I come back? Probably only if required for late night drinks.",

      "text": "Took advantage of an eatigo 50% promotion.\n\nThere are better food alternatives elsewhere, to be honest. The overpriced food isnt worth it even with the 50% promo.\n\nMagherita pizza had a overpowering taste and smell of burnt herbs. “Wagyu” burger patty was hard and dry. Apparently the burger can only be cooked well done.\n\nThe truffle fries are actually plain fries with a side of truffle dip. The chicken wings were okay though, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside.\n\nDo come back here only if you have really do not have other options.",

For 28 dollars u get a welldone (as in cooked thoroughly), dry patty, served with fries and salad. Nonya satay was served colder than the fries, i mean it's a bar and they have an impressive selection of drinks. It has tourist price and should cater to the rich folks staying at the crowne plaza. Would not recommend to locals",

      "text": "First time there and the experience was horrible. I made a reservation and went there after work. Upon reaching, we were told that there’s no 50% discounts for that day because of RWC finals, which we understand, but then we got told no reservations can be made hence there’s no seats for us. It would be nice to have a heads-up so we wouldn’t have made our way down only to find out we can’t get a seat. To find out all these only when we’re at the bar itself makes it feel like a wasted trip.\n\nIn the end we stood along the corridor of Crowne Plaza, watching the finals from the corner outside the bar with no food or drinks (so I can’t comment on their food/drinks). I doubt I’ll be giving this place a second try.",
