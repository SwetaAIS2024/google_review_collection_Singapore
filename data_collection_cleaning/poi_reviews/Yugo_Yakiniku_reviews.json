The scallops were apparently something that was recently added and they did not disappoint! Given it’s location at a typical coffeeshop with the quality of food being presented, it’s definitely a gem.",

We also tried their bbq grill meat, beef is of very good quality, they serve USDA grade quality meat cuts. Heard the satay chicken and the meat sauce are all handmade, very yummy.\nWill be back again!",
