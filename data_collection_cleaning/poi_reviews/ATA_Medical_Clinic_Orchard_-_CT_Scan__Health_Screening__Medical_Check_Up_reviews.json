The nurse who drew my blood was experienced and the experience was painless. My experience with the other clinic staff who did my treadmill ECG and CT scan were also extremely positive and they were patient in explaining the procedure to me. I completed all my tests in 2.5h and the waiting time between each station was reasonable for a Saturday. Will highly recommend this clinic for health screening needs.",

I just didn‚Äôt got her name but 2 thumbs üëçüèº üëçüèº for her.\n\nThe lady who took my ECG is quite remarkable.

      "text": "Booking was seamless, I emailed and got an appointment 2 days later! They communicate through WhatsApp and email, and provide very clear pre check up instructions, if you have any questions, their WhatsApp respond time is very fast within the day during office hours.\n\nI did the Royal package health screening and I was done in 1.5 hours from check in to payment.\n\nThe clinic was busy for a Fri AM, but the staff were very efficient and patient to process the patients.\nThe nurse that drew my blood sample was super skilled, I barely felt anything!\nThe layout and lighting of the clinic also helped to make it feel less congested and comfortable.\n\nTIP:\n1. You can collect the stool/urine sample kit prior to your health screen.\n2. Parking is exorbitant, I think it was close to $6/hour. Orchard Boulevard MRT (brown line) is just around the corner.\n3. There is a Killiney cafe and Fat Cow restaurant on level 1 of the building.",
