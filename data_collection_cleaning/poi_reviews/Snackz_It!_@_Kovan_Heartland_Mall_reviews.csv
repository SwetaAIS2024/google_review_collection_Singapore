Renee Loke,5,"Nice! Crispy crunchy fried chicken! And the mee shua taste very nice. They will only fry the chicken upon order confirmed just to make sure freshness of the food. So, good food worth to wait for a while~ðŸ˜‹",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111861752263933431914/reviews

Pat,5,"I ordered crispy chicken bento set $8.50 but i was too hungry so I did not take photo. The food looked appealing. The chicken (I ordered no spicy) was nicely flavoured with the sour plum powder, I liked the pickles and all other ingredients were nice too. Unlike some of their competitors, they were not stingy about their chicken portion which made me feel that my $8.50 is worth and also gave me a surprise since I did not have high expectations. Plus the staff very good service, always polite and patient. Highly recommend!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116612441308980864130/reviews
Bryan Lee,5,"One of the tastiest fight with all the é¸¡æŽ’ in Singapore! To add on, the service from Heartland Mall was astoundingly awesomeness! Service crew on 26 June 1910H. I never felt so appreciative when he served us so cheerfully and understanding when we came back to ask for slightly more chilli. Keep up the awesome work! Will definitely visit again. 4/5 LEEKS",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108182261386821505896/reviews
