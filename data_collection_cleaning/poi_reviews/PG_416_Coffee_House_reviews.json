Seriously do your customers looks like FOOLS to you?!!",

      "text": "The 5 stars is for Pandan Gardens Fishball Noodles (PGFN). I find its dry sauce is very matching with its white/flat noodles whereby its a harmony of taste between the various ingredients. I started eating it about 6 years ago and I'm willing to travel from North East all the way just to have it. Its other branches though may use the same sauces but I find them different as compared to the original.\n\nAnyway this coffeeshop has a wide variety of food too. The prata in the morning, cheap chicken rice and sze char for the lunch and dinner. If you fancy drinking beer while eating ribs, you can also go next door to Ministry of Ribs. Nuff said.",
