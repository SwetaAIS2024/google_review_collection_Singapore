Sheerin Farhana,1,"The service here is abysmal, an absolute joke. I've experienced it firsthand and watched the staff shamelessly treat other customers like garbage right in front of me. Their atrocious attitudes completely ruined any chance of enjoying the meal. Speaking of which, the food is just as terrible. The Egg and Cheese Ramyeon was bland, lifeless, and a disgrace to anything resembling Korean cuisine. Chicken is raw? Helloo wake up the damn idea. The quality is laughable. Whoever was working at 12pm on 10th January 2025 should be fired or retrained because their 'customer service' is nothing short of pathetic. Avoid this place unless you enjoy being disrespected and eating tasteless slop.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115221430700051226742/reviews
Noelle Ann,1,"I thought NeNe is quite a reputable Korean fried chicken brand but this was just horrible.. chicken tenders obviously frozen, fine, but how did this end up with so much skin and batter that there is minimal meat in each piece? it was so tough to bite into, it made my jaw sore! ðŸ™„ (ordered via foodpanda)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116234446063314971391/reviews
A Rajamohan,1,"Had the 17.90 cheesy chicken hotplate. Just 4 chicken pieces and spiral fries with cheese for 17.90, totally not worth the money. The chicken was red inside moreover and fries was over fried. Only consolation the root beer was nice. Otherwise not getting this dish again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113112529834005197212/reviews
Yingying,5,The chicken was super crispy and juicy. I got the 2 piece meal chicken and selected soy flavour. It was slightly spicy for me even though i chose the soy one. The fries and corn salad was great. The restaurant is abit small so be sure to go earlier to get a seat.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117289079780130956871/reviews
Cloâ€™s Laobu,3,A very warm place to eat here. The spot light on top of you really can makes you sweat and perspire. Didnâ€™t enjoy the delicious food due to the lightings in this cozy place. Iâ€™ll only recommend take away. Chicken is tender and soft in the inside.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114142484779850595642/reviews
