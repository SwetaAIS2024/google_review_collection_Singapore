One is standard \"takeaway-concept\" stall u will commonly see outside. The other is a retro-designed restaurant. Service was efficient. Once you place the order, wait for your number and collect your own food. Please remember to clean up after you eat. Overall good experience. I wouldn't mind eating here again.",

And i really a blast from tge past.\n\nThere are 2 sides to this place. One is d standard \"takeaway-concept\" stall u will commonly see outside. D other, is a retro-designed restaurant. Lets talk more bout d restaurant since it is one of a kind.\n\nWhen u step, you will need to order via d self-service kiosk. Follow d instructions carefully ya.. next is to wait for ur food. We are actually amazed at how the old, current n past is incorporated into 1 place. Well, OCK has outdone itself again!\n\nCongrats and well done OCK!!\n\n#famwithsten #changiairport #oldchangkee #terminal4",
