The last time I came I don't recall having so many varieties, and it's getting more creative!\n\nOur favourite was the flat fish paste as well as the wontons with fish paste. The fishballs are super juicy, bouncy and so rich in fresh fish paste flavours! The price is also so cheap",

      "text": "Tiong Bahru Fried Fishball has been sprouting all over Singapore of late and I was surprised to find a stall at Kovan Market/Hawker Centre. I am especially fond of their otah fishcakes and beanskin fishcakes. It is one of my favourite go to fried fishballs/fishcakes stall since young at Tiong Bahru Market. This stall at Kovan, #01-60 opens from 730am to 700pm which is almost 12 hours. Support our local hawkers as F&B is a very tedious and laborious task. üí™üí™üí™",
