Richard Stephens,4,"Wish could give half points as would have been a 4 1/2,  the food was good but be warned the portions are large we ended up having to take out our deserts as were to full.

The food itself was good and enjoyable although spent a while trying to work out how to do the online ordering!

was walking past the next day and went for a coffee, was good again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116704380738269115108/reviews
Sim Jun Xun,5,"While the dishes may seem simple, one can trust that Real Food painstakingly prepares each ingredient with the intention of health and well-being. They have a variety of vegetarian food - Chinese, Western, and so on. If not for the costs, I will definitely frequent this place. But if it's within your budget, consider coming here more regularly to support their business!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116359336950711248804/reviews
