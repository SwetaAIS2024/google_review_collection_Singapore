Joseph,3,Quiet outlet tucked away at the basement of Waterway Point. The design of the place isn‚Äôt foolproof though. Address is actually at B2M rather than B2. Was a bit confusing to find the way down with no clear signboard even at level 1. Place was just the usual,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104504295951924131990/reviews
Bryan Bamboo Lee,1,"Combo meal cannot upsize drinks and forcing us to buy all in Ala Cart, this is how cinema getting lesser consumer. GV is still better as at least we able to upside the drinks worst ever service. Manager standing there play phone and our drinks already prepare and become deluded... Shaw should look into managing your combo and your STAFF.

Till date, Shaw doesn't care at all. (25Mar)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116193972195868292702/reviews
Enigmatic,5,"I visited the cinema on 26 April, after 6pm to redeem a pair of complementary passes for the movie, ""King of Kings"". Due to a phrasing  in one of the clauses stated within the terms & conditions, there was a minor hiccup during the redemption process. However,  I want to praise the evening duty manager and also the lady counter staff who were patient, professional and polite throughout the situation.  And thanks to them my husband and I were able to redeem our complementary passes and watch the movie in peace. Thank you both very much!üòä",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114075476194165254617/reviews

Besharps,5,"Nice cinema located at Waterway Point, it's great that there are kiosks outside the movie halls to buy tickets. The kiosk machine works well, I have not had any problems with the transactions. The counter service was good, the staff there were friendly. The movie halls I've been in have been clean and sound quality was good. üôÇüëç",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111020676081888304196/reviews
