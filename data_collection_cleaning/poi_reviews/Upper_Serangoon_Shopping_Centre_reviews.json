      "text": "Upper Serangoon Shopping Center is an old shopping center that was completed in 1980. The mall has certainly seen better days, and walking through it (pics below were taken on a weekday morning around 7.45 am) is like taking a trip back in time to the 1980s. A distinctive \"old shopping mall\" smell hits you in the nostrils along with the strong air-conditioning as you enter.\n\nUSSC's most enduring businesses are the vegetarian restaurant on level 3 and the Teochew restaurant in the basement. Yun Nam Kitchen on level 3 sees a healthy lunch crowd - try the teh ($1.20), prawn noodles ($5) and bak kut teh noodles (only available on Fridays).\n\nComing back in recent years made me realise how USSC has changed, and also remained stuck in time, since I first visited it two decades ago in the early 2000s. The school uniform supplier and Chinese art painting shop I remember from back then are no longer around. I like to pop in every now and then whenever I pass by the area - even if only to soak in the atmosphere and be reminded of my younger days.\n\nIn a country where the majority of shopping malls are managed by REITs and have the usual few tenants, to have a strata-titled mall like USSC is increasingly rare. If you are looking for a nostalgic throwback to the past, drop by USSC and support the old-timer businesses there.",

      "text": "Not the usual shopping centre in Singapore. I went there to observe the 1970s-early 1980s building interior. The ceiling is mouldy and most shops are closed for good. Not many people. Escalators are not working. Take the lift instead. Cargo lifts are slower, a bit scary in the atmosphere. Toilets are eye openers! Visit that. If you're from 1070s to 1980s, it's a great time travel for you! Nostalgic and can give a good idea on the architecture of that era.",
