Natalie lim,3,"I am reviewing only 2 stalls here, the Chinese Mixed Veg Rice stall (Lady Boss) and Indian cuisine stall (Khan Saab Restaurant PL). Both had good value for money servings and the food is nice tasting.
The veg and meat at the Chinese Mixed Veg Rice stall is fresh and not over cooked. Had the food here a couple of times and not disappointed.
I had the briyani at the Indian cuisine stall and it was good and not overly priced at $5.50 for plate of chicken briyani. The Indian rojak was okay too but the accompanying gravy was a bit too sweet.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115016144668800125447/reviews

Wayne tham,4,"I'm not a coffee guy. 40+ years Old friends gathering was a superb place. The ambient was good. As it was a week day afternoon, we took the longest table and sat for more than 3 hrs, though the time limit was 90 min. I had a Earl grey for $7.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106084388072929135930/reviews
KiM BooN LeE,1,"Please please do not try the worst fish ball noodles ever... Wondering how could the store sustained during this period... Totally not recommended, try to avoid it as much as u could... At least the 至尊宝药材鸭 is much better... Coffee shop itself charge coffee at $1.20, for that price, u could get a 100x better than this... then come to the ""self claimed"" rojak king, overpriced n kindly please help to remove the ""king"" to confuse consumer... Try avoid this coffee shop as much as possible when u r around this area...",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104527916285751902034/reviews
