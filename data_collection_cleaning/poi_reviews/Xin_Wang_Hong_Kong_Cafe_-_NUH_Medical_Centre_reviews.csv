Siew Yen Agnes Lau,4,"I come here once per week or per 2 weeks during night shift for dinner. Food is acceptable, but it will be better if can have more choices.

The environment is warm, not so cool. Good for those who cannot stand coldness.

I likes XW signature fried noodle or fried rice especially, and add on luncheon meat at affordable price. Taste is just nice and not salty.

Overall is good. Will still come for dinner during night shift.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105627526316780485533/reviews
Ayukawa Sukiyaki,1,"The food was mediocre at best, and there was absolutely no sense of service. When we arrived, there were only 3‚Äì4 tables occupied, yet the two of us were seated right next to another couple closely, even though plenty of other tables were available‚Äîand remained empty even after we finished our meal.

I really dislike this kind of waiter, acting as if everything is up to him. As a paying customer, the experience was extremely disappointing. All the guests were crammed together, making it unbearably noisy.

What was supposed to be a relaxing weekend brunch turned into an unpleasant experience, thanks to this restaurant. If you care about ambiance and service, do yourself a favor and skip this place. You‚Äôve been warned. Dear management, Kindly bring this matter to the attention of the restaurant high level of ur management.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108753260878088237946/reviews

Eileen Neo (Sgsohotleh),3,"A brand that has been around for a long time. I always enjoy your papaya soup since young, whereby you can choose you want it with luncheon meat or chicken chop. I would prefer to go with luncheon meat. The soup is a little salty. We ordered the ÁöÆËõãÁ≤• too, but portion looks miserable. This is abit too plain. Thankfully the dim sum didn‚Äôt disappoint. And giving its service a 5 stars because the service was prompt and the service crew was quite sharp. Oh yes and they have nice milk tea!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114986102670574642770/reviews
sweetmeltedkissez,5,"My daughter and mom frequent this shop whenever she's here for her medical appointments.

I would like to specially compliment Staff Mei Lan for her excellent customer service.
We know her ever since she's at Formal West Coast Plaza Xin Wang. As usual she never fail to greet us warmly whenever we visit.

Thank you for your warm service after so many years. ‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114777103441404567289/reviews
