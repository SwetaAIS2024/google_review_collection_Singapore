Stanley,3,"Decent comforting bowl of sliced fish soup. The clear broth was sweet and rich in flavour. Fish slices were fresh enough. Downside was their portion was really small, and more pricier then other fish soup stalls.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109779294020772182875/reviews
Lee Jerom,5,"this is a gem not to be missed. this stall was passed down to current owner from his father retaining the flavorsome soup like before. the soup while sweet and flavorful does not cloy up your taste buds but has a refreshing aftertaste. their fish slices servings much more generous than other fish soup stall oozes freshness and sweetness from the superb quality of fish used. enoughh said, u have to try it for yourself!!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808137315127099939/reviews
