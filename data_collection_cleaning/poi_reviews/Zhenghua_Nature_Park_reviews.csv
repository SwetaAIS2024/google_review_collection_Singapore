Michelle Schulz,5,"Our first visit having just moved into the area. We ended up cycling from our house which is close by. 7km round trip with 8yr and 4yr old. Great path for cycling with kids, quite shady too and 2 playgrounds on our route coming from Eco Sanctuary condo area. Large long hidden grass area used by mountain bikers kept the kids entertained for a long time. Great if you're looking for a good walk or cycle and live in the area not necessarily a destination park.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107859385814708725876/reviews
Peace-loving Cat,5,"Possible to cycle on the hilly area here but do note that it may result in faster wear and tear of your bicycle (eg. spokes). Be on the lookout for wildlife too so as to avoid running them over (eg. hens, roosters, chicks) or for your own personal safety (eg. occasional snakes). Also, because there have been wild boar encounters, you may want to take some precautions (eg. don't visit from 5pm-8am, make sure your bike isn't squeaky).",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111005175157637855597/reviews
