Nicholas Chia,5,Mee Siam is thick and flavourful. Better than Gloryâ€™s IMHO. My wife Nasi Lemak and fried chicken tasted great too. Menu items runs out so may need to come early and get the freshest items. Kueh kueh tastes sweet and savoury.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115123196928867955800/reviews
Jason Ong,4,"Brought here by a friend who was raving over Aunty Lily's food. My Nasi Lemak was great, I love the sambal chilli which went so well with the blue pea rice. The chicken was crispy and tasty too.
The Ayam Penyet was delicious, and the Tahu Goreng was very nice. Aunty Lily was very friendly, and even gave us a small bowl of Soto Ayam soup to try. If you're around the area, do drop by. But be prepared to queue as it's a popular stall!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews
A T,5,"First time here and was initially attracted to the blue pea rice - so many options and also the Tumpeng with Yellow Rice. Ended up ordering the Gado Gado $5.50 gravy was so good, lots of veg and fresh.  Auntie Lily is so friendly. Ordered another Nasi Liwet with Chicken  - so so good also.  We tasted the Belinjo - tasted to good too except anit too sweet for me but we still bought home 2 big tubs (each $18) coz too nice ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…. Have to come back to try other dishes and the otah, soto ayamâ€¦.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110290698573319690288/reviews
