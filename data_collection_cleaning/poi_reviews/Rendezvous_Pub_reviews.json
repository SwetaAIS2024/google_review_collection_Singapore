It's first location was in Lucky Plaza, then another one  it's a Bistro and there was an outlet then in Orchard Tower, before the management closure of  Orchard Tower and Lucky Plaza. Now, transferred at GOLDHILL PLAZA 01-01, Newton Road.\nWe, the regular customers, fully support. Except if there is jealousy happened between customer to customer on entertainment which causes misunderstandings. Nevertheless, \"Rendezvous Pub' serves better on entertainment, catering \" Local Live Band on Wednesdays and  Filipino Live Band on Saturdays, Billiard's  game table  and customers complimentary finger foods. It's management always friendly and it's management a law government law abiding.",
