I’m not usually a lontong person, but this one I would travel for & eat again!\n\nThis cost $5 after adding begedil! Friendly stall owners, with QR code cashless payment available.",

It’s priced friendly at $3! Their nasi padang is really delicious too! Also on sale are some nice home made snacks like peanut crackers and green bean crackers!",

      "text": "Read so much about the special lontong with jackfruit ($3.50 a portion) that I had to try it. The spices were well blended to give the gravy an overall fragrance and smoothness. It was creamy enough without being \"jelat\". The best part of the dish was the serunding. The sweetness of the coconut brought the taste to the next level. This is a must have. My biggest grouse was that it was too salty especially the jackfruit and the cabbage. The chef could go light on the salt.\nThe lovely surprise to our breakfast was the mee goreng. The mee goreng came with many big pieces of fish cake and lots of chye sim. We were surprised to dig up a fairly big prawn. For $3.50 a portion this was really unbelievable and pocket friendly. The mee goreng had the right level of sweetness and spiciness.",
