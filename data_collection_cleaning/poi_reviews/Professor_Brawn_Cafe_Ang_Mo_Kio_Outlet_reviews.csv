John Leow,5,"I like this place. Free parking in the school carpark. The restaurant is very well-decorated and thereâ€™s so many beautiful and practical merchandise being sold here. Their artwork are contributed by differently abled persons.

We tried the waffle double scoop here. It was excellent. Loved the experience.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116641880786684356476/reviews
CK,4,Recommended by a friend to come here. We had lunch on a weekday. The place is clean and the food is decent. We can add on to the main and make it into a set. Service is good too! It also has a retail section displaying artwork and products designed by Pathlight students. Come and support this social enterprise by Autism Resource Centre. Both cafe and retail shop accept CDC vouchers. There isn't parking within the premises at that time due to school buses. The cafe staff took the initiative to inform us when my friend made the reservation.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114418926781433919968/reviews
