sp khoo,5,"Excellent taste and the quantity was just nice for two of us as seniors. Staff provided good advice on what to order as we were not familiar with this cuisine. Though no warm water was in the menu, staff provided hot water with ice to meet our needs üëç If possible, provide better folks and spoons can be provided for dining in customers. The disposable wooden ones were difficult to handle. Will visit again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105104514585714829676/reviews

Ashley Tan,5,"Ordered the regular sized burrito bowl to-go, plenty of toppings and the salsa tasted juicy. Could be because I didn‚Äôt eat till 2h later, the tortilla chips were a little soggy hence would recommend eating it asap if possible for the crunch.

The lady that took my order today was very friendly and helpful, she guided me patiently on my order and thought it was so sweet of her to call me ‚Äúdear‚Äù, made the experience more warm! :)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108275406328977548659/reviews
