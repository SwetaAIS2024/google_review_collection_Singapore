Kannan Vijakumar,1,"Very rude service from the old aunty. She is very very racist to non Chinese customers. When we reach the shop, she doesn't acknowledge us and ONLY attends to the Chinese customers. The uncle in the shop who does the majority of the work anyway, attends to us with a smile despite being clogged in the smoke making the chicken wing and satay.

For this bias attitude and service, I am unsure how they are running the business. I hope the aunty reflects on her behaviour one day and changes before its too late to do anything.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114107581959359175443/reviews
