Charm McC,5,"Living in a foreign country comes with its own set of challenges, and being involved in a car accident only adds to the stress. Thankfully, we were fortunate to have been referred to a highly reliable repair shop by our insurance. Their coordination was excellent, and we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a smoother experience.

Joyce, in particular, stood out. She was a fantastic communicator‚Äîalways prompt, clear, and consistent with updates regarding the progress of our settlement after we were rear-ended by a company van. The repair work itself was seamless and completed much faster than we expected.

From start to finish‚Äîcoordination, payment processing, rental car arrangement, and the repair itself‚Äîthe entire process was handled professionally and efficiently. We are extremely satisfied with the service and highly recommend this shop, especially Joyce!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100114145512140725130/reviews

Alex Sua,5,"Had problem with my car battery that couldn't start the car properly.  Happened to chance upon Complete VMS where I met Darren, who is very helpful and knowledgable to explain the reason behind car battery drainage due to dash cam recording.  Drove off after battery replacement, but car vibrates.  He immediately knows where the problem lies and quickly solve it.   Very satisfied with his/his team service.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113674287466019583379/reviews
