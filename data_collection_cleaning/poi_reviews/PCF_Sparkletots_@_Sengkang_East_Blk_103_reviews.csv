sherlyn chua,5,"I cannot thank the Infant Care Team at Sparkletots 103 enough for the incredible love, care, and dedication they have shown my son, since he was just two months old. Entrusting him to their care was one of the biggest decisions I’ve made, and looking back, I know with absolute certainty that he was in the best possible hands.

Over the months, I’ve watched him grow from a tiny baby into a curious, cheerful, and independent little boy. His first time sitting up, his first crawls, first steps, and even his first words—all of these milestones have been nurtured and celebrated by the amazing teachers here. The warmth, patience, and encouragement they provide every day have created a safe and loving environment where children truly thrive.

A special shoutout to Teacher Lynn, who has built such a beautiful bond with him. It’s clear how much love and care she has given him, and I know that the joy, laughter, and lessons she has shared will always stay with him.

To the entire team, thank you for making Sparkletots 103 a second home for my son. Your dedication, kindness, and hard work mean the world to parents like me. Because of you, he steps into his next chapter with confidence and excitement. If you’re looking for a nurturing and supportive infant care center, I highly recommend Sparkletots 103!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101841147008802697519/reviews
