Additionally, the big person behind the bakery will constantly offer you the worst customer service experience in Singapore hands down. We go there only because it‚Äôs close to our house. Now we will go FAR to avoid it. So tired of their product and service.",

She was efficient and pleasant, making the checkout process very smooth.\n\nü©∑ Thank You Jumana for your kind hospitality earlier ( hope I spelt her name correctly)\n\nüü¶ I used my CDC vouchers to purchase some gourmet Japanese ( ‚úÖÔ∏è Bourbon brand Torte biscuits ) as birthday gifts.üü® I also bought other Western cookies, grapes, mushroom soups and sushi rolls from the deli.\n\nüü¢ The supermarket's location in Cluny Court, a hub for expats and affluent residents, seems to cater well to their needs.\n\nüü† Location =üî∂Ô∏è  Take the Circle Line to Botanical Gardens MRT station.\n\n‚úÖÔ∏è üü° Use Exit A. ‚û°Ô∏è Cross the small road ( Cluny Road) and Cluny Court is just there.\n\nüü¶14th May 2025 Wed",

      "text": "WORST possible service from poorly trained staff.\n\nProblem 1: They have no idea where to locate the products, directing your questions to their colleagues (to which you will be redirected to another colleague). I refuse to be treated like a caller making a phone call to a help centre.\n\nProblem 2: Why is a customer being asked to do the job of an employee? I waited in line for 10 minutes at the only cashier that was open at 7pm. When it was finally my turn, the cashier directed me to the self check out counter, and told me that she would assist me there. She then passed me two plastic bags and told me to scan the entire basket of products by myself.\n\nThis is appalling - if I intended to use the self check out counter, why would I bother to spend 10 minutes of my time to queue up at the counter? As a paying customer, why am I being instructed by an employee to do her job for her?\n\nP.S. Save yourself the headache and head to Fairprice Finest at Coronation Plaza - staff are highly competent and know all products at the back of their heads, they are also proactive and extremely polite.",

Mind you that's usually the place where people put the basket after paying. Clearly this auntie never been taught about manner and customer service. After telling me off, she continued berating a helper. The helper did not really understand what she said and she was super condescending to the helper.\n\nIt's good that CS Fresh is willing to employ old ppl but please lah.. \"atas\" grocery store needs to have \"atas\" customer service. The service here is below expectation.",
