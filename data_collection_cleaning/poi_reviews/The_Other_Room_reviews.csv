Lena Motley,5,"spent my birthday eve (and actual birthday, once the clock struck midnight!) at this wonderful location in Singapore! From the hostess to the bartenders, I had an amazing time and recommend this to anyone who likes a small intimate place with amazing drinks! Please note small and intimate is very serious, you may have to share space with others. But the vibe is very chill, and even if you have to share, Iâ€™m sure it would be an amazing time!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106448382015406937119/reviews
Empty Inspiration,5,"A well-hidden speakeasy with interesting drinks and great presentation! Daiquiri disguised as peanut sauce for satay. Negroni that smells like and has a hint of iced lemon tea, presented in a tea cup. The layered flavours of the ""Tang Sling"". Wonderful cocktails",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111617489574106543686/reviews
smolbelly,3,"This place was really quite hidden because there was no sign. We had to ask the hotel receptionist to find out that we had to knock the door to enterðŸ˜‚

Food-wise, it was okay but since they are a bar, their drinks might fare better (though I didnâ€™t drink).

Seems like quite a cosy place to hang out!

Saud Sultan,4,"Was invited to the other room . Enter via the lobby of the Marriot Tangs. It's is 'sa small non discriptive door in the main lobby which  opens into a dark room low lighting more like a place where negotiations between  parties where we don't want anybody to know .Cosy soaf setting and bar .
Fantastic service .

The Mixologist Bar tender suprised me with a Whisky based cocktail I am a pureist so a thumbs up not on the menu .So did a friend have a drink looks like served on a Dinosaur egg another on a Skull reminded me of Phantom comic as a child I surely would have ordered that drink .
Also Old Cuban The Fidel Castro and few gin based cocktail.
More for the dramatic entertainment one came in a lantern Full of smoke .
Drama never wins over a good drink .

Rini Ong,5,"Absolutely amazed with this place. As a fellow UIUX designer, I'm impressed with how User Experience is being delivered right from the start before you reach your table to when you foot the bill. It was my first time visiting this bar and I'm already arranging for future visits.

Awesome, great job to all attentive staffs who were always checking if we are alright with the drinks and food served.

I tried out Roa Ae today.
Looking forward to my next visit to try moreeeeee",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113409138975094650381/reviews
