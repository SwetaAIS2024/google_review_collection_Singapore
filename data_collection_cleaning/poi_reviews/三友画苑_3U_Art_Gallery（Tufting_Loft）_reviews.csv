Ryan CS Ng,5,"Exceptional Art Jamming Experience! We had an amazing time at 3u Art Gallery on April 1st! Our family's art jamming session was led by the incredibly talented and patient Chen Laoshi and Liu Laoshi.
Their professionalism and guidance helped us bring our creativity to life. I was particularly grateful for their support in completing my ""Jesus Empty Tomb"" painting, which holds special meaning to me.
The gallery's warm and inspiring atmosphere made our experience truly unforgettable. We can't wait to come back and create more art together!
Thank you, 3u Art Gallery, Chen Laoshi, and Liu Laoshi, for a fantastic experience!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101561596330227637409/reviews

Cindy Yang (Cindy),5,"It’s the first time to experience Tufting crafts with friends!
I discovered this workshop when I was passing by. The teacher in charge, Chen Chen, led us to visit and shared his works with us. After I decided to make an appointment for handicrafts, the teacher was very patient and careful in discussing the pattern, size, and whether the size was appropriate with me, and took the trouble to do so. confirmation and discussion.
The hand-made process on the day was also very pleasant and interesting. The teacher will first explain and let you try it, and then start to draw your own drawings. After the work is completed, he will also assist us in repairing and post-production, and he will also pay attention to every step. work!
This experience was really interesting and fun, and we were all very happy!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108608242315968941965/reviews
