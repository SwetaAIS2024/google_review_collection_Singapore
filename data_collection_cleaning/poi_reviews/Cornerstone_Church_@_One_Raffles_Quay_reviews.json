This is not a church that seeks to tickle your ears with what you want to hear. This is not a church that makes you feel comfortable in your sins, apathy and lukewarmness. After all, this is not a fast food restaurant or a Mac-Church. If you want to grow in your spiritual walk, then this church might be for you.",
