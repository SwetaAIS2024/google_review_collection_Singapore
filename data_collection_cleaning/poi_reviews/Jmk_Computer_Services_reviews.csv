Jyt Ong,1,I think any individual with some form of knowledge about pc can open a shop nearby and they would instantly go out of business and close down.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107076148278838872548/reviews
Amanda,1,"Feel a bit scammed. Charged me $26 for 22 sheets of black and white pages, saying it was because my papers had a lot of images (only a few) so they had to charge 60 cents a page. Came here a few days ago to ask and the uncle said 10 pages was about 50 cents. This pricing feels quite unreasonable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117766535616779306417/reviews
Owen Tan,1,"Owner appears to have restricted expertise on PC problems. Poor customer service, failure to inform me of the estimated time of completion of his evaluation. A fee of $29 for evaluation of my PC, with a verbal assurance that it would take 2-3 hours. No updates from him since I've left the shop. Not expecting much from this place, probably a wasted trip coming here. Even though the location is convenient, you are much better off making the trip down to Sim Lim for professional assistance.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109924511296373442258/reviews
Edwin A.,1,"A store that is obviously non-essential, but made themselves available for NinjaVan parcel dropoffs. Is this even legal?

Storeowners were equally rude and impolite, and took my parcels (before it was counted) and shut their shutters on me. Doesn't incite trust at all and I will not be surprised if any of my parcels have missing contents.

They took 15 minutes to scan 9 parcels and couldn't even successfully scan in 3 of them. Big waste of time. NinjaVan should stop allowing this store to do dropoff service.

To my fellow sellers, I advise you go elsewhere to get your parcels dropped off. I'm sure it wouldn't be as negative and poor of an experience as this.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107762746036499184271/reviews
