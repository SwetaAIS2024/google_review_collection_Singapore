Yellow Bear,4,"The Burger King at Hill View 2 is nice and cozy, unlike other branches with a lot of customers. It‚Äôs a quiet and great place to relax.

Meat lovers can have their Whopper, animal lovers can have their juicy Plant-based Whopper. Burger King keeps everyone happy.

For Plant-Based Whopper, vegans can opt not to have the mayonnaise and religious Vegans/ vegetarians can opt not to have the onions and mayonnaise.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
