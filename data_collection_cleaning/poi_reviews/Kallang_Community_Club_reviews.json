Madam Faisal from the CC (hope we have the correct spelling for her name) was extremely kind and helpful, both when we called to enquire and when we were at the CC. She came out to the car to sight and speak to my mother-in-law to verify details. She then promptly carried out the necessary to effect the Singpass access. Thank you! We are very grateful for the assistance.",

One minor downside, is the spot lighting above the courts can make it hard to see the shuttlecocks flying through the air. The toilets are passable, but not the best for changing in/out of sports wear.",
