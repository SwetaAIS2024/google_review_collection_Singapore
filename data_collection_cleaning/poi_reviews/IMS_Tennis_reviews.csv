lim amanda,5,"Ismael is an excellent coach for young kids. He teaches a group of about 5 children from 4-6yrs old at our condo and makes every lesson enjoyable. Whatâ€™s good about his teaching and personality is heâ€™s very patient and engaging, doesnâ€™t get phased if kids have meltdowns, just carries on and continues with the lesson and a light word (â€˜come on, champâ€™) to encourage them back in again. He makes lessons interesting by getting them to do various small exercises which eventually help shape them on how to play the game. For us, itâ€™s early stages and we are very happy to have Ismael teach our kids.
Thanks Ismael!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107027724818923998424/reviews

YIFANG HU,5,My kid is having a group tennis course with Coach Ismael. They are enjoying it. My kid said  coach Ismael's lessons are different with other coache's. He always allow them to play games during classes instead of learning skills in whole lesson. It's fun and interesting.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111675157942585802905/reviews
