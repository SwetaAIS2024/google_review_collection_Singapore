Donald Lim,4,Very cool air base with friendly and accommodating staff at the front desk. Entrance quite far from the main road so you can reenact that scene from Top Gun of Tom Cruise on a motorcycle every time you visit (please don't speed). However the base is kind of upgrading and is quite dusty from the construction.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115384141903851130368/reviews
SCP-049,5,"For those of you who think they should shut down this military base, you'd be regretting it. You people should be thankful to the RSAF for providing military assistance in case of foreign or even civil threats. If you think shutting one base down won't even quiet things down, think again. The many other air bases will soon cause an even bigger disturbance than before! Be thankful that you have protection from threats inside or out of the country we know as the Republic of Singapore.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102411513464021159154/reviews
