There were also small interesting stories behind the dishes, shared by the lovely female staff. They were very sweet to prepare a surprise birthday tart. We really enjoyed ourselves and definitely value for money!!",

      "text": "A unique experience! Celebrating my brother's birthday at Kioku was the best decision. My typically conservative Teochew brother loved the 2.5-hour dining experience. The fusion of modern French and Italian cuisines, with Hungarian-sourced foie gras, was extraordinary. Every dish was a delightful surprise in presentation and flavor. The white and red wine pairings complemented the dishes perfectly. The ambiance was elegant yet cozy, and the staff were exceptionally attentive and friendly. Thank you, Kioku, for a memorable evening. We will definitely be back!",
