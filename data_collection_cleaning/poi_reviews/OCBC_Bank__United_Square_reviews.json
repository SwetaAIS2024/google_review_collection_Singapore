But the lady at the counter was so kind and helpful in ensuring my transaction was done correctly despite my lack of familiarity. She even told me not to rush, and helped to fill in some forms. We were done in good time and the whole experience felt like privilege banking. The branch is full of books for adults and children which you can purchase, and has a relaxing feeling. Would definitely come here again if needed.",

She can do better by giving a number upfront . Was even told to go back office assuming same building. Only 2 person working at counter in peak period . Seriously not customer oriented .",
