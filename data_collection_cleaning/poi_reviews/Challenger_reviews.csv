JM V,5,"My wife and I have been on the hunt for an iPhone 15 Pro Max and visited 3 to 4 stores to compare prices.
After some searching, we finally stopped by Challenger at Jurong Point Mall, and Iâ€™m so glad we did! Their price for the iPhone 15 Pro Max was much cheaper than the others we had seen, making it a great deal.
The shopping experience was smooth, and the staff were helpful throughout the process.

Overall, very happy with our purchase.
Highly recommend checking out Challenger for tech products!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113607140413131397124/reviews
