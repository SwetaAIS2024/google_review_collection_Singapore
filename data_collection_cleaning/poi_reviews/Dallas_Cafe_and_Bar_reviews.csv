Anne Marie Kim,4,"I came here with friends, half of whom were vegetarians. So we had vegetarian pizza, salad and nachos (without meat). The only meat we ordered was BBQ wings! üòÇ

The food was delicious and the ambiance was nice. It would have been better if we could get a seat inside, with aircon.

I would like to send shoutout to a super friendly, helpful and smiley waitress call JOY! What an appropriate name, as she was definitely a joy to have!

The night view from here is fantastic! Nice place to take photos!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108954682555429603246/reviews
Rachel Yee,4,"We were fortunate to get a table fairly quickly during dinner time on the first day of Chinese New Year. The BBQ chicken pizza was delicious, with a perfect balance of toppings, and the buttermilk fried chicken was really tender and flavourful. The wings, though, were just average.

Our food took a little longer to arrive, but given the festive season, it was totally understandable. Staff were warm and welcoming, and the weather was perfect for dining outdoors. It was an enjoyable dining experience!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111562434976540372363/reviews

riya sinha,5,"If you are going for ‚ÄúSpectra - Light and Water Show‚Äù at Marina Bay Sands, don‚Äôt forget to grab Stella Artois beer from Dallas Bar and Cafe. Amazing and refreshing beer.
This bar has some good pizza and burgers and overall staffs are very friendly. You can sit here and enjoy the Spectra show and people cycling/skating. We were taken care by May (lovely lovely person and very jolly). We were so impressed by her personality that we visited Dallas Bar & Cafe twice. Will miss you May! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106009451433977585331/reviews
Craig Millan,5,Great pizza and awesome prices a pleasure to find in this premium venue. Our server Joy lived up to her name and nothing was too much trouble. The standard of the pizzas was quite a surprise and the chilli and Parmesan cheese a great addition. Daily happy hour until 8pm the perfect accompaniment.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114353641775092241109/reviews
