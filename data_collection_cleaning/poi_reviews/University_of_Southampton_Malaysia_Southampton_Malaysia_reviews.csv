Safia Athar,1,"Looking at all the reviews, it is clear that bribery or favours play a huge role in Malaysia. All the reviews are saying almost exactly the same thing as if they have been given a script. The reality is VERY DIFFERENT. There is NO university campus. These cheapskates have opened up a few rooms in –– wait for it –– a MALL! Yes, the students study in a MALL. That's your wonderful university experience. Their own website is deceiving potential students. POTENTIAL STUDENTS, BE WARNED!!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113080296547958798190/reviews
Gerard Pillai,5,"Great Ambience, Dynamic Team and All Round Progressive Academic and Corporate Environment. Superbly designed for both aesthetic and functionality, the University of Southampton Malaysia is definitely going places!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110416475361310133918/reviews
Ivan Ling,5,"Top tier university in a small package. The lecture halls and labs are equipped with world class facilities, imagine, lights on the lecture hall controlled by touchscreen panels, HD projectors, full coloured oscilloscopes, temperature controlled soldering stations for EVERY STUDENT just to name a few! It really blew my mind when I first visited! The entry requirements, however, is extremely high. This reflects the high ranking of the parent campus in UK (Where it is consistently in the top 3 for engineering). Of course, if you are looking for a degree in arts or business, this is not the place for you to go. But if you want the best Engineering degree in Malaysia and UK, you know where to go to!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112090517443781592747/reviews
