Angeline Soh,5,"Recently, we went to Plate & Palette for my son birthday brunch.
They love the cafe a lot as there are swing sitting area where my kids love it very much.
They also have varieties of food to choose from as well.
Most importantly, they are affordable & generous portion.

We enjoy our meal at Plate & Palette. We even celebrate my son birthday by ordering waffle with ice cream for him.
Highly recommend.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109979941846743924155/reviews
YeeTing Ang,5,"Stumbled upon this cozy spot and it turned out to be a real hidden gem! The swing table added such a fun and unique touch—definitely a hit with the kids. The kid’s meal was well-portioned and delicious, and judging from the happy giggles and clean plate, it was a winner.

Tried the fusion pasta and a couple of western dishes—everything was hearty, flavourful, and comforting. Great for both adults and little ones.

The gelato and waffle combo was absolutely divine. Warm, fluffy waffles paired with rich, creamy gelato—just perfect.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113682820127019633910/reviews
Jeanrin Loh,5,Very cosy and family friendly cafe. The chicken chop is on point and my girls love their kid meal pasta. Waffle ice cream is a must.

jaslyn chen,5,"savoury their rosti, western, pasta and waffles. They even have a unique swing table as well, my little's one love it so much~

If you are a tomyum lover's, recommend their tomyum cream for you, the fragrance of the spice and chewy spaghetti with blue swimmer crab meat, prawns, white clams and squid.

Their fried chicken was tender and savoury with waffles is good. Last, ended our meal with waffle chocolate :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110713683461154129798/reviews
