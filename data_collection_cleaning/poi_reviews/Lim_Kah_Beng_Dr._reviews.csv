Lee San Ang,5,"Best doctor for skin specialist. I had very strange skin issue after recovered from my covid. Doctor did blood test and provide special cream. About 3 weeks, fully recovered.

Yui San,5,"one of the best yet underrated derma in Singapore! i've been to other reputable derma clinics in Paragon but they would just get more money from you by doing ""exams"" and prescribe you with expensive pharma ointments. If ointments wont work, more aggressive treatment like injections is next option.
But for Doctor Lim, you can tell he knows his craft. At one look, he knows the problem. He issued a customised ointment which is not available on any pharma (seems their clinic mixed it), and its very effective. It a 1-2 months, thick huge eczema on leg has reduced by half and no more itching. and by nearing 1 year, eczema isnt itchy and flakes are gone!
IF YOU HAVE DERMA PROBLEMS, VISIT THIS DOCTOR! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114717380413864812527/reviews
