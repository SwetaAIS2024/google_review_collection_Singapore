However, prata was cold, very soggy and chewy, not much crisp on the outside.\n\nCurry was rather bland and watery. Environment was full of houseflies.",

      "text": "Happened to chance upon this place which is hidden from plain sight. The coffeeshop exudes an old school vibe, with limited number of stalls available (fish soup, fishball noodles, drinks and prata).\n\nTried the coin and was plain prata, and they were disappointing. The prata has no chew at all, leaning towards the mee huen kuih texture if you know what I mean. Coin prata was overly thick, and strangely, it was coated with sugar. The mismatched sweetness and thick dough with almost no crispness made it hard to take a second bite. The curry, while not bland, was watery. For the price, I would go elsewhere to have a more satisfying prata treat.",

      "text": "Today, Donkey and I went to Sri Murugan Hill Temple for a Ganesha blessing.  On our way out, we stumbled upon Ga-Hock Eating House 佳福餐馆, and a craving for a hearty breakfast led us to its doors. The moment I stepped inside, I was transported back in time—it felt like a true old-school eatery, radiating a nostalgic charm. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting.\n\nDonkey raved about their mushroom minced meat pork noodles, so I decided to give it a try. As per his recommendation, the noodles were indeed delicious, bursting with flavor. The crispy fried pork added a delightful crunch, taking the dish to another level.\n\nOverall, my first experience at Ga-Hock Eating House was fantastic. I'd definitely give it a 5-star rating!",
