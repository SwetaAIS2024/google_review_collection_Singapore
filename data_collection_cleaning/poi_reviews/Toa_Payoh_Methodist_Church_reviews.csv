Meng Foo Choo,4,"Decent church, the ground floor is a confusion with cars, pedestrian, event halls, food, and lifts to the second floor where the main praying hall is located. A small space that can contain hundreds of people. The Chapel is cozy. I came here to attend a nephew's wedding. Both very committed Christian. Wish they have wonderful children and complete the family.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118082395255459356366/reviews
