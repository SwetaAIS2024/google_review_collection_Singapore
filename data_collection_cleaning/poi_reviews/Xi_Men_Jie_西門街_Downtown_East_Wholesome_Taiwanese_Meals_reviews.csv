Cassandra,3,"I recently visited Xi Men Jie for dinner, and while the food was absolutely delicious, the overall experience was a bit of a mixed bag. The staff, mainly Vietnamese, were able to communicate in basic English and Mandarin, which was appreciated, but their service left something to be desired. They served us with a cold tone and monotonous voices, which didn‚Äôt really create a welcoming atmosphere.

What stood out as particularly odd was that even after paying the service charge, we were signaled to go to the counter ourselves to collect our drinks. This was especially strange because the restaurant was fairly quiet when we visited, and it just didn‚Äôt make sense for us to be asked to get our own drinks‚Äîespecially when they charge for service.

Food-wise, however, Xi Men Jie really delivered. The dishes were flavorful and well-prepared, and I truly enjoyed my meal.

The vibe was a bit average, too. The staff were chatting loudly i Vietnam language among themselves (two female staff and one male staff), which disrupted the atmosphere and made it feel less relaxing than it could have been. While the food was great, the service and overall experience didn‚Äôt quite live up to expectations, especially considering the price with the added service charge.

All in all, the food was definitely the highlight, but the service and ambiance could use some improvement. Would I go back for the food? Yes. But I‚Äôd hope for a more polished experience next time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117012786490278517792/reviews
Jerome Lim,5,"Pleasant experience - the salted chicken is personal favorite. Last order is 2115pm, they close at 2130pm. Service Is fast and friendly even though it‚Äôs near closing time.

Btw - the restaurant offers a free drink for a review. Doesn‚Äôt require it to be 5 stars - so it‚Äôs quite fair, but it also might explain the large number of reviews for this restaurant.

Boon Leng Teo,4,"23 Jan '25
Food was tasty and of adequate amount. Oyster meesuah was smooth on the tongue, and delightfully balanced in saltiness and sourness (vinegar is optional). The oysters were luscious and sizeable. Long beans were crunchy, with a bit of wok hey. Cheese onion egg pancake (chicken floss), oozed with cheesy goodness that contrasted nicely with the floss. Unfortunately, options for hot drinks are limited. Still, with reasonable pricing and only 1% service charge, it made our day.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101216731478850605752/reviews
Sophia,5,We visited for the first time and really enjoyed the food that we ordered. All the food was freshly made and tasty. The chicken cutlet was cripsy. The eggplant üçÜ pieces were juicy. Overall a great enjoyable meal. They offer a free drink with a review too.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111615675032637806889/reviews
