Ravi Panicker,1,"This Dr done one cystoscopy in his room and my prostate got severely infected

T O,1,"Great doctor but waiting time is either over 1 or 2 hours and that is just unacceptable in this day and age. No matter how good the doctor is, he or she needs to respect the patient’s time as well. On top of that, how can there receptionists be so unprofessional? Being super nosy and asking all these personal questions that doesn’t concern them at all.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100157492600428697208/reviews

Chicken Noodle,1,I think Dr Tan needs to change his staffs. They are all very rude. No empathy at all to the patients. The clinic are so crowded. You still have to wait for 2 hrs even though you have made an appt and come on time.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113613094546046373906/reviews
