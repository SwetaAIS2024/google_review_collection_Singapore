Sten (Piqued Wanderer),5,"Been here a couple of times before but keep forgetting to update here.

Finally we are back. Slight changes to the place but it still serves one of the best cakes around. Lets dive in!

Food:
Dessert and cakes....nothing can go wrong unless bakers cant make it.

Service:
Staff was always smiling, so yeah, keep it up ya!

Atmosphere:
The place is not big but sufficient for customers. There is actually a visible baking area but it may actually be for class setting..

In a nutshell, this would be one place we will recommend if you are near Sultan Mosque. It will be a waste if you are near but skipped this place..

So yeah, come on down!!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115011929186540431052/reviews
Jen T,4,"Went on a weekday, sad to know that thereâ€™s no dining in. Luckily managed to reach home without any issues with my 2 cakes and 1 cupcake.
Standard for cakes still there - I last ate their cakes and cookies 2-3 yrs ago.
Cupcake wise, I think the flavour is a bit mild even though the cupcake itself is sufficiently moist.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105399337499263120963/reviews

Linda Ipin,2,"Reason I give 1 star is for their delivery service, delivery was late by 40 mins expected del from (11.30am to 2.30pm) n also the cake arrived was not really in gd shape. However the taste of the cake was delicious and for that I gives 4 stars.. I hope Fluff Bakery can make some improvement the delivery service in future.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115813658513050385104/reviews
William,5,"Ordered cream donuts and cupcakes the next day from this Halal shop for my Muslim friends. Donut is good, cupcakes are tasty, cream didnt feel too heavy. Base cake was moist!
Very good! Location itself maybe not as convenient as it's not too near MRT station, but it's quite worth the travel.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114916696399917166666/reviews
