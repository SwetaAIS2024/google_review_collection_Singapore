The only time we had missing drinks (which we checked and rectified on the spot) was when I mass-bought for 20 people for a takeaway.\n\nToday, Jac kindly explained that the Table Number should be indicated for mobile orders instead of the Table Tent number.\n\nThis place is generally clean but can be really packed during meal hours.",

My number was called for collection; went up; counter staff said order not ready, pls go wait; I waited; until my number completely disappeared from the screen. Turned out the coconut ice cream machine is down and NOBODY bothered to even check with us and tell us. They simply SKIPPED our order. Hello?? Also, who does chocolate cone like this??? If you can’t be bothered to work there then don’t.",

Can only refund and waste our time waiting 1hr plus waiting for this meal when it’s just 0.3KM away. On top of that, only one of us gets to eat a whole meal. So is the other expected to reorder and wait another 1hr plus JUST for the wrap to come??",
