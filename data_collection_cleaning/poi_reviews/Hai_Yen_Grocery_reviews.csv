Low Lay Choo,4,"Well stocked place.  It is a bomb shelter so not easy to spot.     Authentic products from Vietnam.  Noodles I bought and cooked tasted very delicious.  Also, they have ready mix for Banh Xeo.  Prices are not VERY cheap but still acceptable.  Only issue is the difficulty in communication, but they are friendly. Hope the shop will be here for a long time. üôè",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107585676297557057519/reviews
