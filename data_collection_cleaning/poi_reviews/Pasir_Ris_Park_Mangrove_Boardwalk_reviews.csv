Christian Madonna,5,"A well managed park, where chickens abound. Managed to observe a cute mudskipper and a water monitor too.
This morning was cool and the walk heavily canopied. Perfect for a peaceful and relaxing morning stroll.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113671402234210991118/reviews
Florence Leow,5,"‚ú≥Ô∏èBeen here a few times to this Pasir Ris Mangrove Boardwalk for a stroll. It is a nice walk and you can view the ancient mangroves from the boardwalk.

üå≥üå≥‚òòÔ∏è There are lots of interesting tropical flora and fauna to be observed too. Here are some throwback photos over the years.

üå≥‚úÖÔ∏èüü®  It is best to come here either early morning or evening time. Because midday would be too hot and humid for a walk.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
Forest BK,5,"Pasir Ris Mangrove Boardwalk let visitors appreciate its mangrove swamp habitat without getting the feet dirty.
The elevated boardwalk network connects the entire mangrove swamp. It even connects to a Bird Watching Tower as well.
A section of the boardwalk lead to a viewing Jetty that overlook Sungei Tampines.
Bird Watch Huts and View Decks were strategically located along the Boardwalk.
Overall, a great experience.
Not too hot even in the late morning as the mangrove tree canopies provided the shade.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
