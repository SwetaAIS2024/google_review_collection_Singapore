Flo Yeow,4,"This izakaya is fairly average considering its price point. Given the competitive landscape in the area, it could benefit from being more distinctive.

Ordering was a bit cumbersome due to the digital menu and lack of images, which made it challenging to balance business conversations with our meal selection. Fortunately, the food turned out to be decent.

Based on my experience, I'd likely only return for after-work drinks rather than a full dining experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews

Zach Tay,4,"The shop is located in town. Quite convenient for a meet up after working hours.

Even though the sashimi are fresh, the portion itself doesnâ€™t match up to its price.

The grilled meat are delicious.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102095348869698977996/reviews
