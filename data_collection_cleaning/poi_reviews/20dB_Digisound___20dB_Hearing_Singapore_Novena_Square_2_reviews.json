      "text": "I recently visited this hearing aid center and had the pleasure of meeting their audiologist, Yee Ven and the staff, Esther. From the moment I walked in the door, I was impressed with the welcoming and professional atmosphere of the center. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the waiting area was clean and comfortable.\n\nDuring my appointment, the audiologist took the time to listen to my concerns and answer all of my questions. They were extremely knowledgeable and provided me with helpful information about my hearing loss and the different types of hearing aids available. They made sure I understood all of my options and helped me choose the best hearing aid for my needs and budget.\n\nThe fitting process was seamless, and the audiologist took the time to adjust my hearing aids to ensure they were comfortable and providing me with the best possible sound quality. They also provided me with tips on how to properly care for and maintain my new hearing aids.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this hearing aid center and their audiologist. They truly care about their patients and go above and beyond to ensure their hearing needs are met. If you're in need of a hearing aid, look no further than this center - you won't be disappointed!",
