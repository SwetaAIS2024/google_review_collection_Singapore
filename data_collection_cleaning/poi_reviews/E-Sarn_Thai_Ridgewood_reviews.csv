Anikaz Travel,1,"Vegetarian food availability: 2 stars.
There is vegetarian food available but it tastes sbad.

Horrendous food. Tastes very bland.
We visited this restaurant as there was numerous reviews stating its excellent service but we were incredibly disappointed. Its unauthentic flavour made us dislike this place along with its sky rocketed price. We ordered the tom yum soup which was incredibly bland. It was sweetish and really felt like dessert more than tom yum soup. The Thai Green Curry was incredibly thin in texture. It was bland and there was no spice. Exorbitant price was also charged for the small portion they gave. 14 dollars for that pile of unseasoned food was not worth it. The tempura was   not even seasoned well. The chendol was horrible and an insult to Thai cuisine. It did not even have shaved ice. There was just plain solid blocks of ice.
The servings is small, the service is inefficient, the taste is horrendous and the cost was exorbitant. They do not have much vegetarian options too.
I will never visit this place again for sure.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100371975357068365869/reviews
M L,5,"Been a patron for about 9 years since their 6th Ave days, they have been around. If you like wholesome family home cooked Thai food, this is for you. None of those Instagramable BS.

This is the only place where I like how the dish, ‚Äúbeef pad see ew‚Äù (fried kway teow) is done. No other place suffice. My staples are‚ù§Ô∏è: pomelo salad, homemade fried spring roll,  pandan chicken wings, Thai veg omelette, and beef pad see ew.

Dine with more people in order to share and try more dishes. They are all good and decent.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113588730686565510910/reviews

Shirlyn,1,Nothing fantastic about the food which lacked the taste of Thai which is suppose to be fragrant and spicy. Maybe to suit the ang mo taste bud.  Nevertheless the mango sticky rice was nice though.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111513535148537521519/reviews
