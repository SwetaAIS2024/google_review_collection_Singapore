Diogy,4,"Tried Volcano Ramen at Bukit Panjang Plaza, and it was a solid experience! I had the beef bowl, which tasted quite similar to Yoshinoya’s—flavorful and satisfying. My wife had ramen (forgot which one!), but she said it was good. A nice bonus: they offer free eggs! Overall, a decent place for a quick and tasty meal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102177092555705223660/reviews
Chong How,5,"Free hard boiled eggs. Sign up for member to gain benefit of 1 free drink (I CHOSE ORANGE JUICE) and Birthday -$5 discount! As it was my birthday Month, I paid only $11+ for this table of food.

Small but fit shop for a ramen gathering. I ordered the Karamiso ramen for $13.80+. After GST and Svc charge it became $16+.

The best is the chashu which gave me a wow! factor. Will come back if craving ramen again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116852952092019913610/reviews
AlexNicholas,3,"I didn't know the hot stone bowl has noodles in it, ordered regular and it also comes with rice(almost couldn't finish it).

price wise for hot stone is rather pricey as there isn't much meat inside just lots of veggies. the soup tasted average only... free flow hardboil eggs too. not the best tasting ramen but edible.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106023226129429339053/reviews
