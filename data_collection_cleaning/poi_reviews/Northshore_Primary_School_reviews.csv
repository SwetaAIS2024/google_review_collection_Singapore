Josephine Ong,5,"Teachers are fun, engaging, caring and inspiring. The school has a warm family vibe and their focus is on enjoyment of learning. Many leadership opportunities were carefully created for the students. My child truly enjoys learning in this school. The school has an interesting jazzy school bell music for dismissal which brings a smile to the face.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108443491222737055899/reviews
Amongus Boy,5,"Fantastic teachers, principal, admin and management. Teachers are very committed and concerned about every child's well-being (especially during HBL). My son loves school and always come home and share with me what he has learnt. Teachers are caring and teaches concepts very well. There are sufficient practices for grammar, chinese pinyin as well as math practice worksheets. I have noticed my son becoming more disciplined in completing daily tasks and takes pride in doing his work. Thank you to all the teachers of 1 Armstrong!!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116808930905774484297/reviews
