Martin Lee,3,"A Average Coffee
The Pasta isn’t the same anymore but still nice the spicy tuna, The Dark Chocolate ice blended isn’t bad",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114073048745821714183/reviews
Andrew XZ Lee,4,"Had a sandwich with Americano. Not bad for a lighter breakfast and not oily. Salad lightly seasoned.

Only issue was there was only 1 staff at counter serving and taking orders. Not unhelpful and unfriendly at all. When asking her where to out dirty dishes after I used, she told me to out it at the pick up food area. When asking her for confirmation, she snapped at me. Hmm... Oh well.. I guess we all have our days",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103214396992886699987/reviews
Xian You Lim,5,Love the laid back vibes of this branch. Super low traffic on weekend afternoons makes for a great study or work location. The cafe is elegantly designed with a natural wood tone. Lots of food options around after a hard day's work. Coffee is reliable as expected from CBTL.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103392631745003539210/reviews
