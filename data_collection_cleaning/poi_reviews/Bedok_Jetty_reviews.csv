vaibhav phapale,5,Best place to visit and wonderful location for peaceful smoothing air to enjoy. It's a different kind of experience to get yourself inside the sea at some distance to make you feel special.ðŸ˜‰,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111951047706477212103/reviews

Caleb Seo,5,"Very friendly location for beginner anglers . Great spot for salt water fishing . Best fish to catch here is the tamban. You can buy tamban hooks from the aunties and uncles there, they will be cycling around selling fishing gear. If you are looking to catch bigger fish do use the tamban as bait or buy sand worms from the uncle otherwise find the sand worms along the beach. Best alternative is to buy squid from any supermarket. common big fish to catch there are queenfish and barramundi. All the best for your next fishing trip!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112761597490462006955/reviews

Terence Tan,5,"Stayed in the eastern side for many decades and this is my favourite spot for fishing and watching sunrise.

Since school going time, me and my classmate would cycled to Bedok Jetty for fishing. Testing our patience for the fish to bite our baits.

The same for now, with so many anglers fishing, probably doing overnight fishing and came prepared with mat and tentage.

Today am here to catch a glimpse of sunrise at the jetty. Beautiful skylines memorizing rays of lights reflecting at the horizons.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107525131369857002446/reviews
