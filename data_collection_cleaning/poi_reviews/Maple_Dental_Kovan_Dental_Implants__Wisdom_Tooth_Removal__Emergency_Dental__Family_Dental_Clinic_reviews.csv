KL Koh,5,"I had my scaling and polishing done by Dr Colin Lam recently, and it was a great and smooth experience. The clinic called beforehand to confirm the appointment, and the online registration was simple without any filling up of forms. During the treatment itself, Dr Colin and his assistant were patient and professional, and handled the whole process delicately yet very detailed. Dr Colin was also able to point out to me my gum issues and other dental issues I need to take care of, and more importantly, give me targeted recommendations on how to take care of my teeth in the future, which is something that, in my experience, not all dentists would do. I would definitely recommend Dr Colin and his Maple Dental team to anyone who needs great dental care!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110885372606856038145/reviews
Adithi Menon,5,"I had an excellent experience with this clinic. The front desk staff were professional and proactive in providing clear details about charges and insurance. I’ve found the charges to be affordable in comparison to other dental clinics. I visited the doctor for a cleaning, and he ensured my teeth were sparkling clean. As a new mom dealing with recurring staining issues myself, I was especially worried when I noticed stains developing on my daughter’s first molars. The doctor was incredibly kind and reassuring, addressing my concerns without making me feel guilty. I truly appreciate the care and professionalism. Thank you, Doctor!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113920778523722405729/reviews

Gordon,5,Booked an appointment for Scaling and Polishing. Did not wait long even though I arrived half an hour early. Dr Colin Lam and the staff were very prompt and thorough the entire process. He was generous in terms of tips on better tooth and gum care and what we can do other than just brushing to advocate self efficacy in our dental health. Remember to bring your CHAS card for subsidies if you are eligible. Highly recommended!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107363602113588642096/reviews
