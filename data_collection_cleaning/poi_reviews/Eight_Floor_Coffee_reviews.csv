Calvin L,5,"Nice place to get a coffee to perk up after a good cycle by the Bishan park connector.  Very easy to find and drinks are quality and affordable.

Had the signature iced mocha and love it totally. Would highly recommend to come again. There are ample seats at the void deck to just chill with the drinks.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115091569085183111370/reviews
The Ultimate Fan,5,"A quiet quaint little place where the owners sell specialty drinks from their door. You'll have to order online through their website for their Instagram, which has the same name as the place, but the drinks are pretty worth for the quality. I ordered the Mocha and the Match Yakult and both were great, though i should have upsized the matcha Yakult as my family preferred it over the mocha :) Would come again",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106657282419769918229/reviews

Claire,5,"Ordered a white coffee which was fragrant and very comparable to those from cafes. Their matcha yakult was unique and both paired well together, also they were very generous with the matcha! Will return again‚ò∫Ô∏è",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105667002132620852490/reviews
