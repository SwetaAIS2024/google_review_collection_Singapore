June Soh,5,"I always enjoy coming to this outlet for my dinning. The staff is very friendly and approachable.. and the manager (Amy) will provide her best service to serve even when she is super busy.

Will come again",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106599398411470123127/reviews
Alicia Z,5,"Tried this spot based on parents’ recommendation, and it didn’t disappoint!
The set meals and sashimi were incredibly fresh for its value. The only hiccup was the pork steak, which was unexpectedly tough and chewy for dad (and even me). Lucy was attentive and suggested cutting it smaller and cooking further but it will not fix the texture. The real MVP was manager Peter who quickly replaced it with thinly sliced pork that won my parents over. Excellent service and customer care—highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115719203605219968668/reviews
Celine Lim,4,Food is nice. I feel that the time in serving the food should improve. We went after lunch period(close to 3pm) but still have to wait very long for our food to be served.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115973384357631043400/reviews
Kris Heng,5,Have been patronising this restaurant since I stayed here ever since it was opened.  Has also seen Staff Kim growth and development from part time staff to management trainee. Staff are overall friendy. Food taste good and quantities sometimes little inconsistent but overall palatable food. They have also just installed a portable AC in the store. Able to hear customer feedback of hotness.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116535593573392392519/reviews
Teh C Gao Siew Dai,1,"Sunday, 29 December 2024 update: The Sashimi Gozen dish took more than 30 minutes to prepare and arrive after ordering, which is unacceptable. Observed that the sashimi/sushi staff members were busy preparing takeaway/delivery orders. Staff should have the mentality to prioritise dine in orders first, instead of only preparing takeaway/delivery orders, if they are overwhelmed and can't cope.

20 October 2024 update: The Wafu Beef Wazen was rubbish today. Gravy was way too dark and too salty.

Although there was no queue when visited on 23 July 2023, the place was already crowded. Ordering was fuss free and easy via scanning the QR code on the table. Also managed to redeem the free Aka item by informing the server. There was a normal wait for the food to arrive. Part of the total bill was offset by eCapita Voucher. Overall a good experience.

28 May 2023 - No queue when arrived on weekend morning. Ordering was fuss free and easy via the QR code provided. Food and drink came shortly after we placed our order. Settling of bill afterwards was also simple and straightforward. Food and drink were good. Overall a pleasant experience.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102646679801920717610/reviews
