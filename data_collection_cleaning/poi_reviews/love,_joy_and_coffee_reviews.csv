Tiffany Avi,4,An open area coffee place at the walking pathway corridor between shop units. The staffs are friendly. Was impressed with the scrambled eggs as it were nicely scrambled soft and not overly cooked. The vanilla latte a tag too sweet but nonetheless the aroma was inspiring.  Have not tried other items on the menu but it's worth while going there to experience the food and drinks!  Most of the time u can find table to sit at non peak lunch hours.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114416877603095628031/reviews
Shirley Odelia,4,"The food is pretty good but not cheap. Got the recommended sourdough Grilled p&p, flat white, iced German coffee (?) with cream (Einspaner) and banana bread. $38.50 with service charge. No service charge on weekdays. The one taking our order was not awake and I think really too tired out",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109300779610049496461/reviews
Flo G,4,"Love the coffee here! Desserts are interesting and decent too.

There are just too many crowds in this area, this place gets full easily.

The tables are too closed to each other and chairs are uncomfortable.

Not ideal for private conversations and discussion.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews
Tracy Cheah,4,"Probably good place to chill if you have an appointment to wait as surrounding are all hospitals , medical centres and offices. Sometimes depend on lucks if the cafe are not specialised in coffee but surprisingly their coffee is good, I always go for the white ($5.5)üëçüèª desserts wise I recommend hojicha (the green colour cream on top ), not too sweet , goes well with coffee , the other one that has the same look but different colour I think is espresso banana cake. My friend would recommend the muscat soda too. Overall is my recommended cafe ü•∞",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103647774429113433277/reviews
Wei Yng Poon,5,This review is just for their Matcha Latte - they have the nicest and most consistent Matcha Latte. Beautiful latte art made by a young lady. It was reasonably priced and certainly a cup of love and joy for me. ‚ô•Ô∏é,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107352799616553023506/reviews
