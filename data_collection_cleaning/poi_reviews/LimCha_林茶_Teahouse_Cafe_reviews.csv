suzen,5,"I think this teahouse just newly opening only. As I had seen the kettle flowing out smoke with its bbt drink. Finally it has landed at this spot at our little red dot.

The staff were very nice to recommend their signature tea - Ya Shi Dancong in iced. Cos the outside weather was too hot for me. Tot requested for 100% sugar level, not as sweet to my own. The staff did explain not to have the tea sugar level too high in over powering to its tea brewing. Also ordered their cheesecake just nice yuzu flavour. Will come back again for their orh nee cake & perhaps brewing tea in hot üòã

P/S : be careful in climbing up & going down the stairs, quite steep & narrow.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110813622133166743966/reviews
Xuan,5,"I had a wonderful experience at this teahouse! They serve authentic Dancong Ya Shi tea, which was incredibly fragrant and full-bodied ‚Äî a real treat for tea lovers. The atmosphere is serene and traditional, making the tea-drinking experience feel truly immersive and cultural. Their desserts were just as impressive ‚Äî beautifully presented and perfectly paired with the tea.

What really stood out was the owner‚Äôs deep knowledge and passion for tea. They took the time to share the origins and brewing techniques of the Dancong tea, making the whole experience even more enriching. If you're looking for an authentic and relaxing tea experience, this is the place to go. Highly recommend!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104546913588623923365/reviews
