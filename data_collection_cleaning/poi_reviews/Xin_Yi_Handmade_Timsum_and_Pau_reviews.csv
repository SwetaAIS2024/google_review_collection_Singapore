Eugenie Yien,5,"Truly handmade baos and dimsum, will see the staff chopping ingredients and stuffing the buns everytime I go.

Must order from the stall are: Siew Mai, Fan Choy (superb unlike the types you get from coffeeshop drinks stall), the usual charsiu and daosa buns and their Pork Da Pao 大包 (filling to bun ratio is insane).",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111621384317791291931/reviews
