GRC is too rich\n\nVisited on 27 Aug 24, the air con was blasting in the library even though no passioncard library members were inside.\n\nEven if a resident wanted to enter the underutilised library, you must be a paying Passioncard member, and wait for weeks for the membership to be processed before you can enter the library.\n\nThis kind of wasteful and exclusive pattern should be discouraged, and more of us should write in to complain to our MP for added effect.\n\nThe CC should either publicise the library to all to make the electricity usage worth, or switch off until some resident signs in.",

There is also an area for children to read/play/chill, there is also quite a big selection of kids's books! Remember to register for library membership using your PAssion card! Processing time for me, took 7 seven days. After which just tap your PAssion card to enter the library! If you don't have a PAssion card, you can easily register at the CC counter, but processing time for the card would take some time though.",

Such requirement is unique as far as I know on libraries in Sgp.  Such requirement was not found in its FB or web portal for the public.",
