      "text": "My son recently had severe non stop vomiting and diarrhoea in the middle of the night and we rushed him to the A&E of Mt E Novena.\n\nThanks to the prompt care he received at the A&E, he was promptly treated for the vomiting before being warded.\n\nDr Desmond Wai so happened to be the Gastro on call that night and it served us well since he also happened to be the panel doctor of our Insurance Company.\n\nThe A&E nurse told us that Dr would see us in the room at 5am.  It was almost 4am by the time we got to the room.\n\nAnd true to his words, Dr arrived at 4.55am and from the first moment, I was very sure my son would be in good hands.\n\nOver the next few days, Dr proved to be a great doctor who knew exactly what the problem was and thanks to his great care and concern, my son recovered well and was discharged two days later.\n\nThank you Dr Wai for your professionalism and care shown to my son.  We were indeed very fortunate that you were the gastro on call that night.",

Dr Desmond Wai is really insightful about tips to manage different medical issues and his staff are patient people that are committed to serving their patients.\n\nThe clinic can get filled up pretty fast, so try to avoid bringing anyone who does not need the consultation.",

He would make sure you receive the best care and committed to checking on his patients when hospitalized. The nurses are very helpful and very strategic to find convenient approaches to help their patients when proceeding with other medical check ups and laps. I wish Dr Wai's Clinic the best for 2024 and years to come.",

He was detailed in his diagnosis and explained in layman terms which made things easier to digest. His clinic assistant Chris is the best as she was always very helpful and responsive. She coordinated well and promptly with the hospital arrangements and appointments. As a patient, I knew I was in good hands with this caring team.  Thank you, Doctor Wai and Chris!",
