Collin Ng,4,"An interesting neighbourhood. Rural looking houses lines the backdrop seen in between lanes in amongst aircon-ed shops. Opposite you can see the old railway track above the road.
Heard this place is tearing down soon.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100358502333657729087/reviews

DR DAVY GOH,5,"Rows of shophouse that housed many eateries, restaurants and cafes.
There is a wide variety of food available, local food to Italian food as well.
There is a cold storage at one end of the mall.
Ample parking space available and some are free parking, which allow customer to park at no cost.
During weekend, after a lot of people will pop by the mall after their leisure walk around the park.
Good location to stroll during the weekend.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100178836333366849641/reviews
ET Soosay,5,"To Rail Mall management: Observation about the new Burger King at Rail Mall, especially with the existing one so close by at HillV2. It does seem a little ""me too"" given the proximity. McDonald's, were they considered? Or rejected your invite?

Hoping Rail Mall will aim for a more diverse tenant mix in the future, something that complements rather than directly competes with what's already available just across the road at HillV2. That makes a lot of sense in terms of offering shoppers a wider range of options and making Rail Mall a more unique destination.

Another similarity: CS Fresh at HillV2 and Cold Storage at Rail Mall. Consider bringing in NTUC Fair Price when Cold Storage lease runs out.

Just my feedback into consideration for future tenant selections.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115970660408068283527/reviews
