Tan. W,3,"I asked the stall owner for a recommendation since it was my first time dining here. He suggested the pan-fried dumplings, so I went with that, choosing the pork and chives filling.

The dumplings were served with vinegar and chili on the side, and surprisingly, the chili paired really well with the pan-fried dumplings. I usually stick to vinegar, but this time I found myself reaching for the chili more often. The filling was also  the filling maximally stuffed. I’m definitely planning to try the boiled version next time.

Another plus: it's rare to find stalls at Maxwell Food Centre that accept credit cards, but this one does, along with cash, PayLah, and PayNow.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103022836553318535151/reviews
Eddie Loh,2,While the stall holder was friendly the dumplings were one of the worst I had. Had the boiled dumplings and the skin was mushy like wet dough. Fillings didn’t have much taste. Didn’t go for the panfried dumplings as they look deep fried instead.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103918495369995753833/reviews
Jen W,1,"The dumplings from this store used to taste good. I'm not sure if there is a changed of owner as it's been a long, long time since I visited.

Overcooked dumplings should not even be served to the customer!!

How to eat dumplings with meat that are burnt because the dumpling skin is peeled. Take 1 bite and the taste -- obviously cannot make it. Blend and chewy!

Didn't bother to change it anymore as I saw someone eating similar ""quality "" of dumplings.

$8 spent to buy an unpleasant experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109959343059209480603/reviews
