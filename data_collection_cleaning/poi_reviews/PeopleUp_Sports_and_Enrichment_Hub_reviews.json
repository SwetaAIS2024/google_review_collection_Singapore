      "text": "Easily accessible as there are bus stops in front.\n\nBoth children and adults will enjoy this place as learning and having fun has no age limit.\n\nLearn to dance, skate and act are offered here. Also, you can have fun working out or climbing high walls. No worries if you get hungry, there's a place to eat, so far only one restaurant.\n\nOn all the services offered, I am only familiar with Threeesteps Dance Studio (yes, 3 E's) as my daughter is a student there. Her development in dancing can be clearly seen. The teacher is very good and the teaching process does work.\n\nI also saw kids and some adults try the wall climbing. The coaches were very helpful, the reason you can see that those that were trying it are enjoying.",
