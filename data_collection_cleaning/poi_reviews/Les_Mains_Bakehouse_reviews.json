The coffee was fantastic, and the staff made the whole experience even better with their warm and friendly service.\nThey don't have a lot of options for drinks and main courses yet.\nParking is hard to find so you'll have to find roadside parking and walk here\nCan't wait to come back. Definitely one of my favorite spots in Singapore!",

      "text": "Along Jalan Tua Kong. There are some parking lots in front of the shophouse but can be tricky tp find an empty lot. There are indoor seats and a larger outdoor area. The fan is powerful and it does not feel overly hot outside. Waffle is great. There are many ice cream flavours to choose from. The watermelon flavour is good. Good coffee to go along as well.",

      "text": "Nice small cafe with outdoor seats if you have pets. Came on a weekend lunch time and it was almost fully packed, but fortunately we could still get a table. Lunch menu is considered rather limited (and item do not come with sides), but they do offer many pastries. Personally, I like the burger with its handmade patty, but the patty seems to break off too easily, but not really a big issue. Coffee was quite decent. Overall, price is slightly on the premium side considering the portion. Wouldn't mind going back to try the pastries or if I am looking for lighter bites with coffee.",

The Turkish Eggs are equally tasty.\n\nCold Brew coffee was delicately flavoured and Melon Oolong Tea exactly the right level of sweetness.\n\nHighly recommended.",
