J Lee (Jelly),3,Kinda mixed with this cafe. Maybe because it’s new. The curry tasted great with enough savouriness to it. My curry had many balls of flour clumps in it however so I wasn’t able to finish it all. Coffee is good as always and service was decent. It’s situated in the long corridor heading towards Marina Square so having a lively cafe helps the corridor space to gain some traffic. Decent decor,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105417002540148643455/reviews
Lina Lim,3,"Reopened in May 2025 at #B1-16 Marina Square. They used an old promo flyer (from another outlet) so a bit confusing. But its for opening special for May 2025. Also, the promo cannot be used together, so take note ya...

Mee siam $6.80 normal taste. Lime was not cut abit so had to bite into it to squeeze the lime juice out.

Penang char kuay teow has big pieces of prawns but are frozen ones. Have wok hey.

To avoid lunch crowd, go before 12pm.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107917244728844048910/reviews
Lee Chingli,2,"the opening promotion is misleading! it says free 1pc of nyonya kueh with every order, which we assumed every main course in one order is entitled to 1 nyonya kueh.However, we only got 1 nyonya kueh for our order, eventhough i ordered three main courses in the same. The cashier did not bother to clarify as well. Should consider to update the wording to avoid misunderstanding.

+ 1 of my order was missed.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105038087475935556547/reviews
J T,3,It's located just by the entrance to the linkway towards Millenia Walk. The indoor seating is quite hot and stuffy. Coffee is alright but service is quite slow. Disappointed at the quality of the so-called soft boiled eggs which came closer to being almost hard boiled.,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102136104763111141763/reviews
Stephen Chia,1,The marinara pasta is not a huge disappointment. Not a shred of seafood. Only chicken meat. 'Marinara means of the sea. Please charge more and put on some seafood if these cost more.,9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116306016170169383563/reviews
