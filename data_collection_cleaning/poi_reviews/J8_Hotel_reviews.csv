Heri Kurniawan,2,"If you’re looking for a budget-friendly hotel that includes breakfast, this place might fit the bill. Just keep in mind a few things.
First, the location is quite far from any MRT station, so you’ll likely need to rely on Grab to get around. The breakfast is very basic, which is understandable for a budget hotel. The room was okay overall, but the bed was too soft and made creaking noises, which affected sleep quality. What really stood out—in a negative way—was the front office service. The staff, particularly the Chinese man without glasses, came across as cold and dismissive. No name tags were worn, which might be for the best considering their lack of hospitality. I had an issue with the soap and shampoo being completely empty in my bathroom, so I approached one of the Chinese staff members at the front desk—the one wearing glasses, he acted like I didn’t exist. He wouldn’t make eye contact, barely responded, and completely shut down the conversation. It felt like I was talking to a wall.

Overall, the poor hospitality completely overshadowed the hotel’s budget-friendly perks. Definitely not a place I’d return to.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115369565883851225515/reviews
Amy Liew,3,"Toilet was dirty. Has mold around the bathroom floor.
Bed was clean but has stains on the couch infront of the bed.
Breakfast was okay, not bad. I woke up early for it.
Overall stay, 2.5/5.
Would recommend ibis instead for the same price. You are welcome.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110772218081572833428/reviews
Arun Stanley,4,We stayed for four nights at J8 hotel. The hotel was very good. They cleaned the room and gave fresh towels everyday. The breakfast buffet was exceptional. The nearest MRT station is about 600m only.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117990809333172396757/reviews
Mister PengU,3,"This is totally not a good hotel to stay if you love spacious spaces.

The rooms here are really small even for an average adult. Therefore, it is really difficult to move around in here if your family has 3 people or more.

The service here are acceptable. Employees are quite friendly and can speak your local language. The facilities around the hotel are quite delightful if not really convenient for tourists to buy food or necessities.

As for the location, this hotel is comfortably placed in an open street for tourists to find or travel around. But not quite easy to find the hotel if you got lost because the outside looks like a normal coffee shop.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106221141667734271961/reviews
Carlo Miranda,5,"A five star hotel in my family's mind. The food us very well presented. The staff are friendly and can understand English well. Free breakfast buffet! Wifi is strong enough to be used downstairs outside. Tables, floors, even the drain holes are clean! Very little outdoor noises as the neighborhood seems to have a slow traffic rule for less noise. A wonderful stay for the family or... For a honeymoon. Yes, the rooms are secure and soundproof.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114915238620575760104/reviews
