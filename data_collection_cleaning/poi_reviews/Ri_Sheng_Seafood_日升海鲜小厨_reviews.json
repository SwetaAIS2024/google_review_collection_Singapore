      "text": "Been frequent this stall for years. Most unique dish is their Hokkien Fried Prawn Mee 福建炒虾面, no other stall has such flavour and it tastes delicious especially with their sambal source. Other zi char dishes are really nice too. It’s not easy to find the original style of crispy beehoon 香底米粉 nowadays. We often order their Prawn Paste Chicken 虾酱鸡, but with the recent craze of salted egg dishes, their Salted Egg Chicken 咸蛋鸡 is also much better and not as deep fried as other stalls. Call them to preorder if you want to take away or reserve a table!",

Which I did for over three years since I moved into the neighborhood.\n\nYesterday, we finally gave them a tryout and realized what we've been missing. That is, honest to goodness Chinese Zi-char.\n\nTheir menu is impressive, ranging from a simple $6 rice set (sweet and sour fish is good) to fish head soup for family of four.\n\nWe will certainly be back to sample the rest of their menu.  And we just need to walk there (7 minutes) without the need to drive to Pandan Gardens.",

The hor fun has the wok hey that we love and the portions were pretty decent. Staff was friendly as well and gave you the family run business kind of vibes unlike other zi char places. Will patronize again.",
