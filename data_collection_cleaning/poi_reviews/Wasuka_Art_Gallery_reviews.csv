Zack,5,"A really nice place run by a nice owner! They sell a lot of affordable art pieces that are unique and high quality. The owner (Kenneth) is also really nice and hospitable. He even went to the trouble to  unwrap some of the paintings he had in storage. I don’t feel pressured in anyway. It was a genuinely inviting place run by a genuine and nice person. I don’t feel inadequate being someone from a common background.

There’s quite a lot of variety of artwork in addition to the traditional canvas paintings, including ceramics, fiberglass, wood pieces, and more! Highly recommend a visit! Also recommend to browse their social media and drop them a message if you find anything that interests you.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107451660702095806569/reviews
