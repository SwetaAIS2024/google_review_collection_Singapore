Shan Leong,1,"I ordered a plate of rice with Marmite chicken and a vegetable mix (bean sprouts and some leafy greens) for $3.60, while my husband had rice with beancurd skin, vegetables, and chopped fried chicken for $5.20.

After our meal, I walked past the stall and checked the menu again. It stated that a meal with one meat and one vegetable costs $3.20, so I asked the lady why I was charged $3.60. She explained that the Marmite chicken was considered 'special,' but there was no indication anywhere that special meats cost more.

What was even more ridiculous was my husband's charge. They claimed his meal was two meats and one vegetable because the beancurd skin contained meat. When we checked, we found ONLY ONE tiny 0.5cm piece of meat inside. According to the menu, two meats and one vegetable should cost $4.20, yet he was charged $5.20.

We suspect they were simply making up the prices.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112240173833972509206/reviews
Christine Lim,1,"Hiding tiny bits of meats inside veg, and counting those dishes as meat dish. Some dishes are considered ‚Äúpremium‚Äù and has extra charge. But none of these were communicated and extra charge is unclear. Rice was hard and cold. Dishes taste ok, but were quite cold too. Seems like they are just charging however much they want! 2 veg and 1 meat, I paid $5.20. Horribly expensive and rude service",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118024115778214547192/reviews

KyriaL C,2,"They have recently gotten into the bad practice of putting lots of vegetables into meat dishes and charging premium meat prices.

Very disappointing as it's not even economical",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106322363975381990708/reviews
