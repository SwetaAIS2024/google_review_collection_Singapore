CK C,4,"This old school complex has a mixture of residences, shops, offices related to textiles and eateries. It has became quite dead in the past few years but kind of resurrected by an evangelical church at the top floor. There is good view of the neighbourhood from the carpark.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews

Botak,4,"Many old offices are located here. Some have been here since the 70s, and likely bought and not rented.

2 anchor tenants are Maybank on level 1 and a Church on the 4th floor.

A few of the shops are owned by the same landlords since it was cheaper to buy back in those days.

Now, most of the textile shops are gone, even though the name stays. Many shops are rented by PRC nationals doing businesses to cater to the many KTVs or pub hostesses there.

Other common trades also include car dealers and credit and insurance firms with 1 or 2 cafeteria for the tenants as well.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100060791396189603978/reviews

William Lu,4,"Mall seemed to be deserted but surprisingly the toilet was cleaned.

Parking was supposed to fit 3 cars but it was too packed to fit 3 cars.

Lift didn't stop even it says serving the floor. Waited few times for the lift to stop at level 5 from parking lot. Wanted to take the escalators that time but I waited few moment then it was stopped.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
