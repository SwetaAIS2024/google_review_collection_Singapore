So far, I have seen many specialists and some I’ve met are quite skilful as well, but they are more business oriented. Dr Ho will try to explain what is causing your issues and will put your worries to rest. He still drops by my ward and see how I am doing so far and explain the findings and what I should do and eat to rectify the issues. Thanks to Dr Ho for performing my colonoscopy and I will definitely recommend any friends, relatives or colleagues whom might need his expertise.",
