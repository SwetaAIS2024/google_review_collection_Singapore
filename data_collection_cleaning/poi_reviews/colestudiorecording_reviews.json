I can see his heart in wanting us to reach our potential and sing better. He is my second vocal teacher (way better than my previous one). He has good knowledge of music theory and techniques of singing. 2.5 mths of learning and the friends around me commented on my great improvement! if you want to learn singing, definitely recommend him!",

I came with curiousity and guess what, Cai Laoshi was professional, sincere and understanding enough to answer all my questions!\n\nNever painful to give it a try! Who knows this 'try' is actually a forward stepping stone in your singing passion? :-)",
