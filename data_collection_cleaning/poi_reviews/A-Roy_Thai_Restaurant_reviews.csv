Chewielicious T,5,"Portions are a bit small but super flavourful. I love love love the prawn claypot vermicelli, and the coconut shake hit the spot. The stuffed chicken wing is hands down the best I’ve had in Singapore.

Can’t believe I only just found this place — I’m already planning to come back with my family to try the rest of the menu!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112973732117339181795/reviews

ERIC CHAN,5,"Consistently good and authentic Thai food. The BBQ Sotong is so nice, chewy and tender. The place doesn’t feel cramp. Ventilation is good. Great for a nice meal. Recommended",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113614902035973411013/reviews
Dry Gin,5,"First time trying I must said Good and Authentic Thai Food. Variety of food to choose from the menu. Grilled sliced pork -tastes flavourful, fats and meat is well balance pair well with the chili. Kaeng Jend Woosen - The soup was rich and satisfying was a true comfort food for me. Deep fried chicken wing - Not oily and taste perfect. Pineapple fried rice and Pad Thai both are scrumptious. Pad Ma-Keua Yao - Delicious. Mango sticky rice - Sweet and Savory. Will definitely be back to try on other dishes. Conclusion - Must Eat!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106957648674682049825/reviews
Goh Phoebe,4,Food five stars all tasted exactly like authentic thai. But cos’ we didn’t reserve a table for 2 and walked in at 5.45pm to an empty restaurant were given a faraway corner table. Even at 7pm when it left was not full house. Moral of the story: don’t walk in without a reservation!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105025019280262870270/reviews
