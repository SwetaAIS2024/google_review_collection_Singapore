John Miksic,5,"I've been a patient here ever since I had a bypass operation at Mt Elizabeth in 2000.  I have been going to Dr. Lim 4 times a year since then, making a total of over about 60 visits. I have always obtained the best possible care from Dr. Lim and his excellent staff.  He is always unhurried, always intent on listening to his patients, and does a very good job explaining his treatment to non-specialists. As a long-term survivor of bypass surgery, I am very grateful to Dr. C.H. Lim. I wholeheartedly (pun intended) recommend him in the highest terms possible.",10 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103868782603110748110/reviews
