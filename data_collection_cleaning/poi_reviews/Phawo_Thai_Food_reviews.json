      "text": "Erm.. Din't bother to read the reviews and went straight to order. Service from the ladies at the stalls was very good, keep on recommending dishes. Was kinda lost on what should I order, thus ordered quite alot ðŸ˜‚\n\nRemarkable dish shld be the Tom Yum creamy soup. There were seafood in the soup, hearty and okay for the price paid. Pad Thai was pleasant to my palate, kinda like it thou. The bbq chicken was not bad, tender and soft with a hint of lemongrass taste with smokey flavour, nice. Stirred fry qing long cai was not bad.\n\nAnyway, maybe it was during dinner time. The wait for like 10-20mins... I'm pretty fine with it, thou.",
