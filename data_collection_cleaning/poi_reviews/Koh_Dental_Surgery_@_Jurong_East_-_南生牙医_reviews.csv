Joelyn Khoo,5,First visit to Koh Dental for scaling and polishing. Dr Sven Ng and nurse were friendly and made sure I felt comfortable and relaxed. Dr Ng was also detailed in explaining what they were doing at each stage. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I would recommend Dr Ng.

IzaDora Pan,5,"Came here upon mum's recommendation as my regular dentist was on long vacation. Didn't ask for his name but would like to compliment for his assuring and calm personality.

WR,5,"Really the best dental experience of my life. For the first time I felt relaxed in the patient's chair. The dentist was extremely gentle and explained at each stage what she was doing during the scaling and polishing process, and asked me to let her know through raising my hand if I was experiencing discomfort at any point. Could not recommend this place more!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105376728103411501426/reviews
