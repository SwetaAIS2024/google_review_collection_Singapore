suanty tio,5,"My talent childcare is definetely a childcare of choice for pre-schoolers, its curriculum not only covers academically, but also social ,interacting  and motor skills. My 3 kids were with this childcare, they really indipendent and did not have any issue with their new school and environments after graduating from my talent. The teachers are skillfull and well trained in managing and attending each child needs. KUDOS to my talents childcare, my youngest daughter very enjoying her new primary school, her new friends, and teacher even now assigns her to take care a so call "" naughty boy"" at class, she has to wake him up should he falls asleep or loss his focus at class. MANAGING MONEY, during recess also not a problem as my talent taught her how to count and manage $$ at K2. Thank you my talent childcare for equipping Shirley with necessary skills before her new journey at primary school.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101745093178640907451/reviews
Chia lynn Goh,5,"My Talent has a good learning environment with a vast outdoor area that provides ample opportunities for kids to explore and have fun.

The management team is very approachable and understanding. They respond promptly to any concerns brought to their attention. Teachers are professional, enthusiastic and caring. They work closely with parents to support childrenâ€™s learning and development.

Most importantly, knowing that your child is safe and happy in school while you are at work brings a great sense of relief. Thanks to all educators and staff for providing children with a conductive learning environment. Their efforts are truly commendable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116418056714961000989/reviews
