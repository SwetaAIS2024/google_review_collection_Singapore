I usually go to the western and noodle store to enjoy my meals but sometimes also try economy rice and fish soup. I don't really like the price of the drinks I feel it is too expensive, but overall I like this place am often frequently eat here",

      "text": "Came specially for wanton Mee but was disappointed. First, stall only opens at 9am on Sun, had arrived earlier and thought it was closed so I ordered other food. Ordered dim sum from Kimly which I feel is expected taste and slightly below standard of other branches. Avoid the Lor Mai Kai, was dry and hard... Can have the Chee Cheong Fun and Har Gow, porridge and Siew was ok. Also had wanton Mee when it opened.Taste was ok? Sauce not too bad, char Siew is just char Siew...most appealing is the wantons (but note lotsa celery inside). Soup is veryyy anchovy for those who like it. $4.50 is too expensive for me. Would not come specially for this. Parking available at next door mscp. Coffee and tea not too bad. Note that no Muslim food here.",

Seriously if can I won't want to use their tray..\n\nTrust me if u see how that wipe their tray.. you won't use it also.. this applies to  many food centre, kopitiam, coffee shop and etc..",
