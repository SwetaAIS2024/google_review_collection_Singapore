Josiah,4,"Nice place to get your rocks!
Lava rock here is $2/kg which is about half of what others are selling.

They don‚Äôt provide plastic bags so do bring your own if you‚Äôre buying quite a lot.

Do note that the photo of the building is not the same.
I reached here looking for the building which I saw on Google maps but couldn‚Äôt find.

Turns out it‚Äôs inside this pee Huan trading co building.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102907636743760669809/reviews
Beh PangYoke,5,This place sells different kind of pebbles (small chips to larger rock 12cm length) by weight ( min. 1kg).  I think some people visited the place to buy the pebbles for landscaping projects but I was there to buy rock for paper weight painting.  Their office is on the 2nd floor and their staff very friendly.   I was very glad that I was able to buy small retail quantities.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114980034135746445684/reviews
