Cornelius Yeo,1,"Bad stall providing low quality meat. Can’t follow simple instructions and yet rice is uncooked, barely any taste.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102866429479795777424/reviews
Val Lim,1,"Ordered takeaway macaroni with added chicken and vegetable and one roasted chicken rice (btw the chicken rice packet was untouched, as seen from the picture). Paid $9.90 in total. And they barely gave any meat???? Omg mostly bones. And they are obviously breast meat as you could tell from the rib bones, despite requesting for ji wei and paying extra. This is the most ridiculous and worst chicken rice I’ve ever seen /tasted. The rice was also all clumped together and tasted like plain rice. Please avoid at all cost. Very very horrible.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117231858095589257810/reviews
