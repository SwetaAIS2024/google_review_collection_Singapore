Elaina Yeo,5,"Totally recommend Our Tampines Family Clinic. After trying from clinic to clinic, finally found the right one. Brought my children when they're ill and for vaccinations. Dr Tan is very professional, friendly and Dr Nic is precise attending to his patients. My children felt nervous at first but they felt at ease after. They were even given stickers. The staffs were professional and welcoming from the moment we walked in. The doctor and nurse took their time to explain everything clearly. One of our visits, we saw a small girl vomitted and the staffs were very attentive to her, comforting her.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117052744743612436853/reviews
