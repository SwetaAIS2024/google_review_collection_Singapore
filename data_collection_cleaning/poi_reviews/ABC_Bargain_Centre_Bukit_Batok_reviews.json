Is this a Singapore service nowadays. To the staff, if you not happy working, pls don’t spoilt the company reputation Don’t  throw your tantrum to the customers. You  don’t have to scare the little kid.. If this happened to my child, I would shout at her and make a scene.and demand for the apology. Shame to the company to have staff like that.",
