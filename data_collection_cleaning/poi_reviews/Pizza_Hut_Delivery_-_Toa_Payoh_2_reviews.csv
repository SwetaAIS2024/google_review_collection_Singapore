Mani Kalai,1,"This is how Pizza hut Blk 85 Toa Payoh Lorong 4 makes Shrimp Aglio Pizza! (This is Regular size!)

I ordered through Foodpanda. Receipt as Evidence is attached. (Image below)

Foodpanda REFUSED TO REFUND ME for this Poorly made pizza!

Even after SHOWING THE IMAGES OF THIS PIZZA on their live chat!

We Pay Money for our food! This is how Pizza hut and FoodPanda Treat Customers!

Samantha Tan,1,"Ordered via the website since 615PM. Payment went through, and email was received which stated delivery date and time being 5th April, Saturday, 655PM.

Current time: 853PM (when im typing this review)

This is ridiculous. I’ve been on the hotline since 715PM (one hour after ordering) but no one was available to even pick up the phone call…

This is the longest time i’ve waited for a delivery. And no help was given. Website says if you want a refund, please call the hotline. I am still on the hotline hoping for a CSO to answer and refuns the transaction… Current time, 855PM, still no answer.

Submitted 2 feedback on their website, not too sure if anyone will even get back to me on that. Because i demanded for an explanation and feedback from them.

Please, if you would. Avoid at all cost. If you really want to eat pizza hut, just order it via grabfood. At least CS is a lot better than this pizza hut one.

Time check: 857PM. Still waiting for an answer on the phone call. Ridiculous. Horrible CS.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113197576339336193658/reviews

Jessy Kyra,1,"I ordered through the delivery app...and redeemed a garlic bread as I got the  reward points...however I did not receive the garlic bread...then what's the point of creating reward points for ur customers when u did not even bother to double check the orders?!
It will be better if the reward points were not being created in the first place right???
This is not the first time I ordered from Toa payoh lorong 4.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110910579745633015630/reviews
