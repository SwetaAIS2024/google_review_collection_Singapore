Mariana Wijayanti,4,"This coffeeshop has a few gems. One is Collin's of course and the other is the pig organ soup stall.
The pig organ soup has a lot of ""liao"", soup is tasty too. Great buy.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108001174912079525778/reviews
jun liang Tan,5,Near my church and have seen many stall change owners time and time again because of high rental cost. But does not disappoint me. With the current stalls it is a place a frequent quite often.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109355570638759425356/reviews
Jasmine Loh,1,"Hong Kong Roast Stall is a horrible stall.

The chopper decided to yell at my father and he chose not to retaliate to prevent extra friction.

Food - disgusting. The noodles were absolutely tasteless and the soup was just as bland as the aforementioned man's service.

The auntie drink server was rude. Very certain this auntie has spotted us but chose to ignore us when we tried to order drinks from her. When she sees other customers taking their seats, she goes over quickly to serve them.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102867725816007147841/reviews
Henry Christian,1,"This review and rating are for Nanyang Seafood (Zhi Char stall).

I ordered fried rice ($5.50) and san lou hor fun ($6). They were beyond awful. Rice was way too dry and tasteless. Hor fun was insipid and there were only a few pathetic slices of fish. After a few bites, we had to throw away our food. Unfortunately the awful after taste lingered. Simply disgusting.

AVOID AT ALL COST.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115131263219786984291/reviews
