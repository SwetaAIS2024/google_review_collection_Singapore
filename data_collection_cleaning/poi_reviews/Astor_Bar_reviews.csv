Carl N Ricketts,5,"Good, secluded bar in the St. Regis Hotel, relocates within the building because of the ongoing refurbishment of a large part of the premises.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113631304837320392678/reviews
Holton Ramoin,5,"The Astro Bar was awesome. The drinks were great, staff were friendly, and the live music was a nice touch.

Something that we didn‚Äôt see discussed here was the Picasso‚Äôs on the wall. They have 8 Picasso pieces which made the ambiance even better.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100624200677012409879/reviews

üíú My friends and I went to Astor Bar years ago when St Regis Hotel first opened

‚óè I remember the soothing ambience and the excellent service.  ‚ú≥Ô∏èThis reminds me I should return to St Regis hotel again, and visit the bar once again. ü©∂ I had very good memories of the bar and hotel back then.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102381074513494763902/reviews
John Heckendorf,5,"Visited the Astor Bar late Dec 2023 to enjoy a couple of cocktails.

When we arrived I wasn‚Äôt sure how long we‚Äôd stay as the place seemed deserted but we persisted and the place became more lively over the next hour or so.

We chose to sit at the bar and enjoy the theatre of the various drinks being made. Sahil knows his stuff and is quite entertaining.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102807086769790004981/reviews

Seafood Buffet

- FOOD
Everything was fresh don‚Äôt get me wrong but most of them were cold dishes or on ice. The only hot dish which was tasty was the Barbequed King Prawn. Hope to see more effort in terms of how the seafood dishes were served e.g. the king crab legs in Chilli/Black Pepper sauce, Lobster Thermidor, etc. Lobster Claws on ice would have been better deshelled before serving with a simple strike & twist with a knife in the kitchen, as we weren‚Äôt given any tools to crack them open.

- SERVICE
Service was alright, just that I was approached one too many times by the servers that wanted to clear my plate while I was still eating. Butter plate on the buffet line was quite a small block which was emptied out quickly, and wasn‚Äôt replenished for the next 30 minutes even after requesting it from one of the managers.

- CONCLUSION
Overall the food standards in terms of freshness were high, but lacked creativity. Would definitely come back again after the menu improves.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102268392596213732988/reviews
