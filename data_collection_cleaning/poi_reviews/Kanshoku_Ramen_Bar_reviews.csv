Richard D Lee,2,"I was fortunate enough to try the ramen when this store was newly opened. The truffle ramen was so good and the truffle smell permenated across the seating area.

However, the recent time that I had the opportunity to try again, wasn't that good

Service- It was generally good. led to the table and told to order with QR code.
Our free water came after we ordered. Food came between five and ten minutes. Had to go to the cashier counter to make payment.

Food- ordered truffle broth ramen,Gyukotsu shoyu ramen (beef broth) and Charshu charhan. All were not up to expectations as I was sorely disappointed that the standards had dropped drastically.
All broth was like diluted and didn't give any satisfaction from drinking.

Location- orchard gateway mall level one.

Value- about 20 per pax after all the service charge 10% and 9% GST. There should be better ramen around at about the same pricing.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104510170228491104585/reviews
Wendy Mar,5,Love the soup base of the black garlic ramen. We also ordered truffle broth and tonkotsu ramen. They were simply delicious and can tell the broth is cooked from scratch because we do not feel thirsty after eating the ramen. Food was also served promptly...didn't have to wait too long. Can choose the texture of noodles that we prefer. The tonkotsu portion is generous and texture is soft and it simply melts in your mouth! ,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103748512269087148753/reviews
YT,4,"This restaurant in Somerset, is absolutely amazing. Their dry truffle ramen is my absolute favourite. Every time I visit, I always order it because the creamy texture and rich truffle flavor are just unmatched. It’s a ramen experience that you don’t find anywhere else, and it’s definitely a standout dish.

Their soup ramen is great too, but the dry truffle ramen takes the top spot for me. As for the service, it’s decent—nothing extraordinary, but nothing bad either.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116335289933602715039/reviews
LL MAH,2,"Negative feedback - Kanshoku Ramen Bar, Orchard Gateway, 11 April 2025, Friday, 20:23 hrs.

We are big fans of your restaurant chain and have been loyal customers since your first outlet at ION since Covid-19, followed by Orchard Gateway, and now your newest location at Raffles City.

We were extremely disappointed with the standard of our meal tonight. The Truffle Edamame was served with a sourish taste (which is unexpected). Furthermore, the signature Dried Truffle Ramen was tasteless beyond the truffle fragrance, and the noodles were tangled and lumpy.

We sincerely hope that the standard will improve after this review.

We will most likely skip this outlet for a while until it's back to its normal standard again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111633888863606742084/reviews
Sheue Lin Ng,3,"Tried their spicy ramen. Firstly, the broth lacked depth. The chayu  pork smell is a bit strong with a frozen food taste. So it's not too my liking.  The black fungus was a bit too hard.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100782595262033627690/reviews
