      "text": "The sign includes both English and Chinese text, reflecting Singapore’s multiculturalism and bilingual policy. English is the dominant language in Singapore, facilitating communication for locals and tourists, while the Chinese script acknowledges the heritage of the area, given Telok Ayer’s historical roots in the Chinese immigrant community. In terms of code preference, English is the dominant one her – being displayed at the top, while Chinese is inscribed below. This reflects Singapore’s language policies, where English is the First Language and the ethnic mother tongue being the second.\nThe sign is simple and functional, providing the name \"Telok Ayer St\" in both languages. Its green background and white text follow the typical colour scheme of Singaporean street signs, ensuring consistency and easy recognition. . The sign’s emplacement at a prominent crosswalk makes it easily visible to pedestrians, acting as both a directional aid and a cultural marker.\nPositioned in an area that is both full of heritage and near the Central Business District, the sign is a reminder of the area's cultural history amidst urban development. The choice to include Chinese characters helps remind people of the location’s past.",

So I approached the MRT service staff to ask if I could borrow an umbrella and they did not hesitate to lend it to me. I wanted to leave my contacts but they declined. The trust and service really far exceeded my expectations! Thank you Telok Ayer station staffs. You didn’t know how much this small act meant to me. May all of you be blessed with good karma (:",
