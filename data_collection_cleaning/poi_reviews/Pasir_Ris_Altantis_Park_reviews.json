Of course, it is full of ocean themes, blue, shells, starfish and other designs. The surrounding fitness equipment is divided into entry-level and advanced levels. It is a good place for exercise, but it can be seen that this is a relatively long park. The traces of direct sunlight all year round are obvious, and the green shade is slightly insufficient. It is better to come in the evening.",
