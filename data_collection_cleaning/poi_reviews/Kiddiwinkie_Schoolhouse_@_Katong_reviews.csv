Jolene Ng,5,"Today, I had the wonderful opportunity to be invited to my son’s class to read to the children. While my son has always been excited and happy to go to school, this visit truly confirmed for me that we made the right choice.

What struck me most wasn’t just seeing my own child engaged and joyful—it was seeing the other children, too. I know some of his classmates outside of school, and some of them tend to be quite shy. But in the classroom, I saw a different side of them—confident, expressive, and full of joy.

That’s when I realised what an incredibly safe and nurturing environment this school provides. The children feel free to be themselves, and they are clearly thriving because of it.

I am deeply grateful to the teachers and staff at Kiddiwinkie Katong. Thank you for creating such a safe, warm space for our children to grow.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116323210645218982990/reviews
