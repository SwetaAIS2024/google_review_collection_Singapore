war mane,1,"Please avoid this mart at all cost! This 2L knife brand oil cost $13. The price tag on the shelf is $8.70 but at the cashier she says its $13. Even when I explained to her the shelf price she refuse to budge. When it was scanned at the POS machine it reflects $13 for 3L of oil. She immediately manually edit the description to 2L. She mentioned that it comes with a free gift thats why its $13. Totally nonsensical!

I was in a rush of time as oil ran out cooking halfway and had no time to argue so I paid.

Checking the price on major supermarkets, 2L Knife brand cooking oil even with so called free gift is around $8. What a rip off for a neighbourhood shop. Please never ever visit them. Surrounding shops have way reasonable pricing.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103646760050268605095/reviews
D Lim,2,"The chinese guy and the ladies are so friendly and know their stuff. The other guy who was at the shop on 1 Oct 2024 let the other customer who came in later to jump the queue to handle his purchases and let who were there earlier to wait for so long. Asked him to handle our collection first as we were there first and he told us to wait. He was already handling the 1st lady collection half way then he turned to the customer to handle his purchases. C'mon do you know all customers no matter buying or collecting parcels need to queue and wait for their turn. Instead, you let us who were there earlier especially the 1st lady to wait for you to find a carton of cigarettes where you don't even know where it was at. Still told us to wait when we were there so much earlier than the customer. Though he was buying things from your shop, but we are also your customers who also often buy things from your shop. Only that this time round we were collecting parcels. Because of the staff, the service ratings of the shop dropped. Please educate the staff involved on customer service etiquette. If he is the owner of the shop, then he has done a bad service.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114038414505948086113/reviews
