RuiXuan Lim,1,"I regret to say that my experience at has not been positive. While the school places a heavy emphasis on its external image, it seems to overlook the more important aspects of education and student support. A significant portion of the school’s resources appears to be allocated toward organizing trips for certain students, which leaves the quality of academic instruction and the overall learning environment lacking.

In addition, frequent and often unnecessary changes to classes have caused confusion and frustration. This has made it difficult to maintain a consistent and focused learning experience. I also feel that the school does not prioritize creating a sense of community, as class compositions are frequently altered, making it harder to form meaningful connections with peers. It would be more beneficial for students to have classes with familiar faces, rather than being constantly mixed with different groups.

The layout of the school could also be improved. The distance between subjects often requires long walks across campus, which wastes valuable time and adds unnecessary stress to the school day.

Overall, I do not believe that this school can provide the supportive and enriching environment that students need. I would not highly recommend this school to others, as it seems to prioritize appearances over substance and student well-being.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115678013205596617823/reviews
peanutbutterwithbutter,4,"great, seniors are kind and friendly and on the first day teachers will give out snacks to everyone!! vice principal and principal are very humorous and fun to talk with. The reason why i didn't give it a 5 star is because the school is super strict with hairstyle, especially for people with bangs.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104432159258362568635/reviews
Jayden,1,As a student here Bendemeer has unreasonable attire check protocols  as they will pull down your hair to check if it’s touching your eyebrows not like we would be walking around with our hair pulled down and makes us cut our hair so short to the point we look bald and feel socially embarrassed,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101870258221046068660/reviews
Tqnjiro_kqmqdo 101,1,"This school does nothing to show care to the students. Strict rules and long useless talks. “Give us your feedbacks” they say, but when we do give feedbacks, none of our feedbacks are heard. Classes of 2024, majority of us wanted prom, the school ignored us, gave up a boring graduation ceremony where all of us must be in school uniform, and they provided us a buffet, the buffet was not enough for everyone. The school is gatekeeping their earnings instead of using it to make changes to the school and spend more on excursions. This school failed us all, they neglected the class of 2024, we were sent right to our national exams with no fun memories, no camps, nothing at all. Come on, the most the school can do is give us prom, but they did not want to, they gave us a stupid excuse and turned us down. This school is horrible, especially the principals and student counsellors",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107506879299545373650/reviews
Apple Tedd,1,"The vice principal is very unreasonable. He enjoys picking on students and one time a student was wearing jacket and he asked him to remove it, which in my opinion was quite unreasonable. In my personal experience, I was walking back to class from my PE class and he stopped me and he made a cruel joke to me but it wasn't funny to me at all. He joked with me to go to the detention room with the discipline master but I thought he was being serious. After that he said it was a joke and laughed it off but I didn't. I ran off crying because I was afraid of getting punished for no reason and he didn't apologize to me at all after seeing me cry.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111894245004139379068/reviews
