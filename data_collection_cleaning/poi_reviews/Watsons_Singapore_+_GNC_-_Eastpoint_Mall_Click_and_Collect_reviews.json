      "text": "SCAM. I was fooled by their 12.12 sale scam and wanted to share my personal experience. I placed my first online order (btw, first order code and other promo codes did not work as they advertised) for 135$ with 10 pieces in the order. They processed the order, payment went through, no alert for unavailability in stock of any of the items ordered. But they silently delivered 7 pieces worth 38$ and didnot deliver 3 items worth 82$. But they showed my order as ‘delivered’ in the app. Luckily I was wfh and checked the order. When contacted via chat, (no way we can call them, their customer care phone number is discontinued, this is an another pain to deal with) they were silent and hesitant to answer at first. When I insisted an answer, they started giving vague answers like we need to check, don’t have access to store, can’t access stock status, store is not responding, we will get back to you etc etc. when I insisted a proper answer by a manger, they asked me to wait and finally told me that they are ready to give a voucher for 82$ for my future purchases, without giving reason whey they didnot deliver the item inspite of accepting the order in full without any stock unavailability warning. As I don’t have intentions to deal with them again, I asked for a refund rather than accepting a voucher. They finally agreed and told me that it takes 6weeks to refund my money. But they refused to confirm this by email. When I asked for an email confirmation, they abruptly closed the chat window. What a shame. If I had not contacted them, they would have kept quiet and treated that my order as ‘delivered’. If people realise this and ask for refund, they hold your money for 6weeks or keep your money by issuing a voucher. Money is gone if you are not alert. Be vary of this new type of , I don’t know what to call, a scam or fast way of making money or pathetic internal systems & processes? No words. But very bad experience on my first order. I will never ever buy again from Watson. And btw, their prices are way higher compared to their competitors. Bye bye Watson. You will keep losing customers unless you address your core problems.",
