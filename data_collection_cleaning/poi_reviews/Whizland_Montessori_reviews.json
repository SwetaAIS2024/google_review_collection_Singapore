He's happy, looking forward to go to sch in the morning every day and I'm really glad that we don't have to struggle with him every morning just to drag him to school now. Too many schs in the area so its hard to find a good school. The teachers here (e.g. Tr Chua, Mdm Tan) are really patient with my child. Thank you!! (:",

They provide updates via newsletters and photos of my kid's learning process and are very responsive to my queries too.\n\nUpdate:\nMy kid learnt many things and was happy to go to school. She could tell me what she learnt during the Montessori period and what she could do (E.g. knowing how to button up). These are some life skills that I don't really realise that I have not taught my kid what or how to do in real life, unfortunately. ðŸ˜‚",
