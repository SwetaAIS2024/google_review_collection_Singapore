Eden Kew,2,"Bought 2 breakfast sets on a crowd-less rainy Saturday morning.

As I collected the toasted bread sets, I commented to the middle-aged Chinese lady that one set looks burnt and unlike the ones I have usually with kopifellas. Infact, the burnt set was just beside the 2nd unburnt set at the counter. A stark obvious comparison.

She turned defensive and said it would taste better.

I told her that the toasts were for my kids and I won't want them to eat burnt toast.  She continued to ""educate"" me that burnt toast taste better.

Refusing to jump into a spate with her over a couple of $, I told her I would just take the toasts and walked back to my table.

Approximately 10 minutes later, she walked to my table, took the burnt toast away and replaced it with another toast and walked off.

Understandably, good help is hard to find nowadays.  Most customers can well afford to sacrifice a couple of toast slices, however the business ultimately suffers when they lose customers with subpar service and product.

It would seem that the business could do better with more service training.

This is the 3rd time I had issues with the toast sets.

1st and 2nd time were with the Earl Grey jam toasts which turned sour, it was quite some time ago and it seemed like your staff knew about this issue.   Keeping in mind, both events happened in the morning so I assumed the jam were left overnight/ hopefully not over a couple of days for it to turn sour.

They simply just replaced it with the normal
cheaper toasts without any apology.   The earl grey toast has since been taken off the menu.

I'll give your toasts a miss and stick with just your aromatic kopi in the future.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100102763304538897928/reviews

Edwin Ting,5,"Unassuming little shop tucked away in Timbre+, Kopifellas has one of the best kopi (local coffee) I have tasted. The coffee roast is strong and fragrant, yet the coffee is not bitter or over-powering to the taste. I had mine with condensed milk, and it the milk was not too strong, but a good blend with the coffee. Thumbs up to the young fellas behind Kopifellas.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109835410526625976569/reviews
