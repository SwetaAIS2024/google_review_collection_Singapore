Soup dries up quite quickly but you can ask for 1x refill if you got the set, and hot water to add on after. We used out noodles as shimei and the texture was perfect.\n\nWhat we ordered\n1x beef set $85\n1x nanban chicken\n2x additional servings of Aus Beef",

      "text": "A very quaint and cozy place for dinner.\nThe collagen broth here is well balanced - not too salty and not too bland. The crab chawanmushi is a must try - the eggs were softer than tofu and it came with a nice layer of crab meat.\nService was impressive - they were shorthanded for the night but the sole-runner still did her best to fulfil all our requests rather quickly. She went the extra mile to drew my parents a chocolate artwork for their anniversary. Made them really happy.\nDefinitely a place to return to.",
