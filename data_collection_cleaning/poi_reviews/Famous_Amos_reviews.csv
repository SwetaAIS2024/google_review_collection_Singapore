Aneth Ng-Lim,5,"I make this sweet stop every time I am in Singapore, which is becoming more and more often.  I signed up as a member awhile back and had a lovely surprise when I bought a couple of cookie bags yesterday.  As a member, I was gifted a box with 200g cookies on my birthday month.  Thank you for this figuratively and literally sweet gesture!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104358988811633137000/reviews

Eugenia Lim,5,"Love the new soft serve concept!
The cookie sauce is so delish!!
Downside I experienced was that two out of three cookie crumbs were either empty or barely any left (like not even one table spoon left). It's an additional $2 for self service toppings and it'd be nice to check and replenish lacking ones.

Will go back for the cookie sauce üòÇ",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111947819787831067613/reviews
