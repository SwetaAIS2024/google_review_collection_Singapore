      "text": "Used to patron the bryani at 622D Punggol Central. However today when i visit them for my usual to go, i was asked if i can opt for chicken breast instead of leg for the bryani. Taken aback i insist on the leg as there were plenty of them on displayed in the glass rack.\nUpon payment, i was told each packet cost $7. Shocked but i paid nonetheless. I left and switched on Foodpanda and discovered in their app the bryani at the same stall selling for $6! Why such attitude and intentions to deceive? I went back to the stall but they have closed the shop for their afternoon break.",
