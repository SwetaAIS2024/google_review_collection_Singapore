M P,4,"My new fave Nasi lemak because of the chilli. It‚Äôs sweet and spicy like traditional malaysia simple Nasi lemak style.

The rice is also nice n fragrant. Chicken n ikan bill is was not bad

I‚Äôm any case the Nasi lemak in Malaysia also only rice n chilli with some sides. Chilli is supposed to be the star and it‚Äôs same w Istanbul restaurant.

Highly recommend to try.

Note the Nasi Padang was alright only although it‚Äôs not expensive.

2nd visit apr‚Äô25

Was missing the taste so I made a long trip to Tampines to eat this again. There‚Äôs queue on sat lunch time.

The chilli is still on point and really the star of the dish. Very shiok with right balance of flavour, sweet & spicy.

The fried anchovy also nice fried n crispy without it being too hard

Sadly the fried chicken taste very oily & greasy n I don‚Äôt like it.

Otherwise it would have been awesome nasi lemak. I will still eat it if I‚Äôm in area but I won‚Äôt travel too far coz of oily chicken wing",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112908652574347918174/reviews
fearrow,5,"I've been craving some delicious nasi lemak, and one of the best places to satisfy that craving in Tampines is Istanbul Coffeeshop. Their nasi lemak never disappoints - the rice texture, the sambal, and the fried chicken are all top-notch. My parents tried their mee rebus and absolutely loved it too.

If you plan on visiting by car, you can conveniently park at the multistorey carpark at blk 475.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114871863174076338408/reviews

Sean Yong,4,"On my to visit places for my nasi lemak fix.  There was a slight queue in front but there were quite fast.

Now onto the food review.  Honestly the nasi lemak did not look promising but boy was I WRONG!  The star of the dish as most commented was indeed the sweet savoury sambal.  We loved it!  This stall sambal closes resembles many Malaysian style nasi lemak chilli.

The ikan bilis was crispy and fresh!  Coupled with the fried eggs and fried chicken, it was a really good nasi lemak dish.

Recommended! üëç",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108535124596952191042/reviews
Ar√πndal St√§nisl√¢v,4,"Been coming here since around 20 years ago. But only in the last 10yrs  i frequent this place more regularly. If you came at the right time when rice is just prepared, it melts when you consume it, what joy !! Of course over the course of 20years, the standards flucutuates but always good, regardless weekdays or weekends anytime, you see a long queue, and the stall owners never fail to serve you with their best smiles on. They used to sell roti prata, thosai not sure what happen now they stopped, and a nationwide chain opens up next door selling similar. Hope they bring it back",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105130194568465171640/reviews
