The cashier is not efficient and hence always long queue.(especially in the afternoon, they will close 1 counter and the queue is so long that it blocks the entrance) The lanes between shelfs are so narrow that can only fit a single adult. Furthermore, because the shop is so damn small, you can't find a lot of things here. Peace.",

The Pasar brand 30s eggs per tray display on the outside of the store are not fresh, please check to see if there are expired dates sticker attached on each tray before buying. There are 2 cash counters only but often only 1 counter is open . Exceptionly long queue before 9am and from 5pm to closing.\nElderly customers do not stand 1 metre apart in the single queue line. Often customers jumped queue. Service cashier staff just ignored those customers that do not queue in line.\nBe extra careful about their Mailing can luncheon meat, there are no expired dates shown below the can, their small bottles of Maggi tomato ketcup does not show any expire dates also. Sheng Siong supermarket at bedok central, most can food have expired dates.",
