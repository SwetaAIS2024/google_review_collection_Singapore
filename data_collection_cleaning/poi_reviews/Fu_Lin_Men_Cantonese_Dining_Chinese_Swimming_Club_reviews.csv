Ron Yang,5,"Well made dim sum - you MUST try their Siew Mai. It‚Äôs a large portion, full of flavour. Another must try is their dumplings - full of broth.

The wet Hor Fun is also worth a try - the gravy is thick and the noodles are cooked just nice

Recommended place, but reservations are required. Within SSC. There‚Äôs parking for members of the public (non club members)",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104960568279362160422/reviews
Edmund Ho,5,Switched to this alternative FLM for family dinner after the one at NSRCC was closed. Food was very good and service was excellent. Tip: go ala-carte if you know your preferred dishes. Complimentary parking too.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110400657629395024917/reviews
Carolina Lee,4,"This restaurant is located on the third floor of Chinese Swimming Club. This is my first visit and was quite satisfied with the quality of food that they serve. As we were early, tim sum was available. We ordered almost everything on the menu to try! The hongkong style chee cheong fun had much ingredients inside and was nice and soft. The char siew bun was not too sweet in taste and flavourful. The carrot cake was quite a big portion and fried to perfection. The porridge was amazing! The texture was just so smooth and didn't need any sauces as it was already tasty. We also ordered the braised chicken feet but felt it would be nice if they were softer. All of us love the dumpling in vinegar and chilli oil! We had to order another two portions! It goes so well with some dishes. We also enjoyed the xiaolongbao. The soup is delicious! The fried food on the tim sum menu was also quite appetizing. Dont forget to try their dessert like mango pomelo and red bean pancake!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107633230426589548423/reviews
Germaine Lim,1,"We had ordered the course meal before the appointment date, however the food comes slower than a wedding, and when asked, they say kitchen closed at 9:30pm. It was 9:10pm and we still had 3 dishes for two tables left. The wait between each was at least half hour. Its 9:20pm now, and still 2 dishes to go. This is ridiculous! How is it possible that it is only 6min more to the kitchen closing but our 2 dishes are not here yet! Will not return again! There are so many other better chinese restaurants out there!! Horrified to say the least and this was for my grandma's 88th birthday",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103967000380983536884/reviews
LongEr,1,"A highly overrated and dishonest restaurant! Some diners experienced food poisoning!

Calling Guangzhou Roast Duck ""Peking Roast Duck"" is totally misleading. It lacks the genuine wood charcoal roasting, the crispy exterior, and the transparent wrapper of Peking Roast Duck! Placing the duck skin separately on a plate with cucumber and spring onion and claiming it's Peking Roast Duck is deceptive! This can mislead diners who haven't been to Beijing into thinking that Peking Roast Duck is similar to local roast duck! The rest of the duck meat served later, without the crispy skin, is comparable to regular hawker center roast duck‚Äîaverage in quality and seasoning. To make matters worse, it's accompanied by honey! Excuse me! Since when is honey a condiment for Peking Roast Duck?

If you want native Peking Roast Duck, definitely avoid this place!

ü¶êBoiled Shrimp ü¶ê
Decent. The tiger shrimp is firm, without any unfresh feeling.

ü¶êAbalone with Broccoli
Tastes strongly of canned abalone. You could achieve this level of dish by cooking canned abalone bought from the supermarket.

ü¶êShark Fin Soup
Surprisingly made with real shark fin, definitely better than the shark fin soup in pasar Malam. It's the standout dish in the entire set.

üêüSteamed Fish
Perfectly cooked, showcasing the skill of the Guangzhou chef.

Other cold dishes are supermarket level, something you could make at home. The fried noodles aren't tasty, with a strong pork flavor! Perhaps, due to considering the dietary habits of non-pork eaters, this set meal surprisingly lacks a main dish with pork!

For Halal diners looking for delicious options in Guangzhou cuisine, it's challenging, probably only seafood is eatable. No wonder Guangzhou cuisine leaves the impression of ""not much delicious."" Considering reports of some diners experiencing food poisoning, it indicates significant hygiene and cleanliness issues in this restaurant. A rating of 4.4 on Google Reviews is highly overrated; a rating of 3.3 on Dianping is more accurate!

But because some diners here lack food expertise, this rating is given to maintain balance, and it should realistically be a 3-star rating.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107257477085501290498/reviews
