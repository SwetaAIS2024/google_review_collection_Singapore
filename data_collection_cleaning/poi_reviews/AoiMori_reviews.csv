Sandee Goh,5,"We stumbled on this place while looking for Japanese food at Cuppage Plaza. It‚Äôs a cosy yet modern looking restaurant with excellent quality food at reasonable prices. The pork katsu set was well portioned with delicious side dishes. We also enjoyed their other dishes like aburi salmon maki rolls, and some other yakitori meats/veggies. Will be there there again soon!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112118915863724157585/reviews
