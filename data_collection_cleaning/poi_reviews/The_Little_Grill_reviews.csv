Hatsune Miku,4,"Whoops! I have over-rated The Little Grill. To be honest, this should have a rating of 3.8, but I just cant bring myself to give them a 3 star rating. Why? The food portions are generous, and they even brought the whole bottle of chilli sauce to my table. Lets talk about the gaping flaws first. I ordered the chicken wing fried rice set, and the fried rice was bland. It was fried with pieces of ham and eggs, and a little salty. Fried rice portions were generous. The almighty saviour of the dish was the chicken wing. Crispy and marinated well. Old school wing with that nostalgic fried chicken taste you love as a kid. Fried rice is a big no no, chicken wing is worthy. Eat enough wings and you just might have the strength to lift Thor's hammer.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109198790780321411397/reviews
Adrick Loh,4,Ordered grilled chicken fried rice. Grilled chicken alright. Fried rice bland. Chili sauce does not enhance taste at all. Serving is filling. $7.3 price is a bit high in a quiet neighborhood.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116967523325064503672/reviews
Wan Ling,4,"Affordable Western food & generous portions.

Chicken chops and pork chops are great, love their coleslaw. Fried rice's portion is a mountain - just wish they included more sauce as well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104885864721310344425/reviews
