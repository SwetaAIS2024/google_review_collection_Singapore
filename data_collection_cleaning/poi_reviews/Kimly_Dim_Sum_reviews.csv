Jaime Phua,5,"Went there to have breakfast w my family. Love their new menu — The Nanyang Curry Chee Cheong Fun was delicious, smooth rice rolls with rich, spicy curry and crispy toppings. And I like the Pork Ribs Curry Chee Cheong Fun, the Steamed Pork Ribs is super tender and hearty.
Another new dish is the Nanyang Otak Siew Mai — spicy otak filling in a black charcoal skin, so unique and flavour-packed! Price is very reasonable also, $3.20 for 3 pcs. Great dining option for anytime of the day since it’s open 24/7!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112223496890883053127/reviews
