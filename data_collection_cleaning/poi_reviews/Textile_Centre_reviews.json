Some have been here since the 70s, and likely bought and not rented.\n\n2 anchor tenants are Maybank on level 1 and a Church on the 4th floor.\n\nA few of the shops are owned by the same landlords since it was cheaper to buy back in those days.\n\nNow, most of the textile shops are gone, even though the name stays. Many shops are rented by PRC nationals doing businesses to cater to the many KTVs or pub hostesses there.\n\nOther common trades also include car dealers and credit and insurance firms with 1 or 2 cafeteria for the tenants as well.",
