      "text": "Stopped by on a hot day in Singapore and got an Iced Mocha and an Iced Matcha—both were super refreshing! The service was amazing, especially from Daniella, who welcomed with a big smile and was so warm and friendly and very hospitable which makes one feel at home.\n\nShe also recommended a special dessert called Blossom Bliss, which is only available at the Supertree Observatory. It’s inspired by pulut hitam and has black glutinous rice pudding, gula melaka, chocolate mousse, and a purple sweet potato sponge. Such a unique and delicious desert that I even finished it within minutes because it was too good\n\nGreat drinks, awesome service!",

She took the time to explain the available options, helping me make an informed choice. The dessert turned out to be excellent. Winnie was also very helpful in letting me know the location of the nearest supper spots. I had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back with my friends! :)",
