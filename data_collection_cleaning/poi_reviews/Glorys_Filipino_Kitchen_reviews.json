Purposely drive there to eat so the food will be freshly cooked but when we got there around 11:25am, they said we need to wait until 12pm as they are still close. (In their website, it shows open 11am for dine in) after waiting for few mins, auntie said that they are open for dine-in but they cannot accommodate us as they need to prioritize grab food orders first but they don't know what time it'll end. Just a waste of time going there. Just order from grab food.",

So, decided to order for a small celebration at home, a day in advance, still through foodpanda. On the delivery day however around 4:19PM (delivery sched was supposed to be at 5PM), I was notified that my order was cancelled. So disappointing. It would have been easier to accept if they cancelled in the morning, at least I had enough time to look for options. There's a refund of course, but then time was already wasted. Not sure if I will order again in the future. See how.",
