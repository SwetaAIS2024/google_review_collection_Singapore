Ordered four dishes from zhi char and one from the cai fan. The prawn paste prawn is very nice. We ordered it twice because each portion had four prawns and cost $13. The curry vegetables from the cai fan stall is also very good. The crispy fried prawn cake is super crispy and tasty. The other dishes were not up to par.\nOrder at the counter and when buzzer sounds, go collect the dishes.",

      "text": "I was surprised at how expensive cai fan was‚Äîalmost $10 per person! üòÇ Just because we ordered without rice, it turned out to be much pricier. They counted porridge as a separate order, so all the dishes were charged individually.\n\nGood to know! Next time, if anyone wants to order dishes, they should just order it with rice (even though you dont want the rice) since the servings are the same! They did not give more serving anyways! Definitely not worth the money. üëé\n\nThe service staff always looks like they‚Äôre having a rough day‚Ä¶ Every cai fan order comes with a side of attitude. Just hoping I catch them on a good day! üôè",

      "text": "I can finally understand why this eatery has extremely low rating. The shop has stated for mixed rice, meat is charged at $1.30 and vegetable at $0.80. However when I ordered mixed rice with no rice, instead of charging the above stated price, I was charged $2.5 for a meat and $1.5 for a vege. The Pic below was 2 meat and 2 vege without rice, costing $8. Do note, for a customer ordering 2 meat and 2 vege accompanied with rice it would be about $5 only as I have ordered before. Hence, basically a customer is penalized for excluding rice from the dish. Portion wise, trust me, there is no difference from one accompanied with rice. Do order at your own risk. All the best to their business.",
