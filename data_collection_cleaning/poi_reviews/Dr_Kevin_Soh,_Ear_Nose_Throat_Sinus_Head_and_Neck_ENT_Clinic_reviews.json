      "text": "I regretted not checking out the bad reviews of the clinic before making an appointment.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nThe doctor (not sure if he was Dr Kevin Soh or the radiologist) I met became agitated simply because I declined additional tests that were unrelated to the issue I had explained. He also made no effort to clarify the purpose of the test. While he mentioned that ‘everything could cause headaches,’ even knee pain, it seemed inconsistent that he did not order a test for my knee. It felt absurd and poorly handled. The doctor did not attempt or provide any reasonable medical advice (except to tell me to pick the tests I would like to perform) but claimed that he would charge a consultation fee.\n\nNurse was rude as well. Go if you have money to spend. If you have an urgent ailment, I am not too sure if this is the correct place to be at.\n\nSometimes I wonder why I would spend time and effort to write this but just to inform fellow Googlers of my experience.",

Very dismissive ..\n\nMy postnasal drip didn’t improve at all after said day surgery involving 3 procedures which was supposed to a “simple fix” to my problems.\n\nWouldn’t recommend this doctor/clinic",

He posted a video on preauricular sinus removal with 700k ++ view (one of the top search results).\n\nIt's important to engage a skilled doctor for preauricular sinus removal since the cyst might be pretty deep in the ear and partial removal would result in continuous infection.\n\nDecided to engage Dr Kevin for my preauricular sinus removal on both my ear since it was getting infected regularly (3- times a year recently). The surgery was a few months back. The wound healed and there was no problem afterwards. Would highly recommend Dr Kevin.",

      "text": "My experience with Dr Kevin Soh has shown to me he is truly a caring surgeon with vast knowledge,  experience, reliable and has a skillful pair of hands. I highly recommend Dr Kevin.\n\nMy first surgery for pre-auricular sinus 20 months ago has failed. I had endured recurring infections & pain regularly with the previous Dr at his wits’ end.\n\nDr Kevin identified the issue instantaneously after examining me. He was comforting me, assuring, explained in detailed yet with high standards of integrity & professionalism during my few visits. The surgery went well. The problematic area apparently was deep. I did not feel any pain post surgery.\n\nI am truly grateful to Dr Kevin for his dexterous surgery skills. 3 weeks post surgery now. The scar is almost invisible. I could go back to swimming & scuba dive very soon. Thank you so much Doc !",
