Alanna,5,"We've been here a few times, including for their CNY Hi Tea Buffet a few years ago.

This year's Ramadan Buffet had a good spread, including durian goreng, fresh durian (opened after 8.30pm), and Baskin Robbins ice cream. We also enjoyed dining by the poolside where you can bask in the night view and cool breeze.

For breakfast, they offer basic local and Western food choices.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109170802800041082215/reviews
Adrian Chua,5,"Managed to try this cafe's buffet breakfast as part of the hotel stay. The variety is awesome, including authentic Malaysian nasi lemak (with beef rendang and curry chicken for sides), porridge with condiments, western-style salad, fruits, toast, prata/roti with dhal, fuit juices, milk and coffee. It complements the hotel stay very nicely.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104805418112540145105/reviews
Chia Chiang Tan,5,Service led by Jay is excellent here. We dined here for the family fiesta set. This requires one day in advance booking notice. Food is on the heavy side of taste. To keep us occupied Jay started us with fresh cut fruits and French fries for the children.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103416289077744534273/reviews
Andy Hun,5,Enjoyable Father’s day High-tea. Live band music and don’t forget the kambing briyani at the back! Relaxing atmosphere and staff are friendly and helpful.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116860824083515624608/reviews
