mike pow,5,"Visited this church since 2014. It's a small, Chinese-speaking, Bible-centered-church, people are so welcoming and loving. The sermon from the pulpit has helped me in my spiritual growth. The small group fellowship has helped me to feel belonging. Thanks and Praise God for leading me to SBC.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105182700108281421466/reviews
