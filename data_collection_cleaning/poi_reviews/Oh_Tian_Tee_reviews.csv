Ojisan “Hiroshi”,4,"First of all, Oh Tain Tee is not the name of this coffeeshop. It’s name is actually Coffee Sense (咖啡鄉）initial post got it wrong.

Strange that such a small little ulu coffeeshop in AMK can gather so many reviews.

Non the less, I feel that this place is a hidden Jem. With good variety of food, clean and cooling natural wind even though it’s sunny right now.

The stalls mainly are: Indian food, porridge, carrot cake, roasted, fish soup, fish ball noodle, mix veg rice, seafood zhi char, claypot delights and western food. Not bad.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112623517876975514039/reviews
