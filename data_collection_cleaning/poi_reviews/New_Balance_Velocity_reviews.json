Nobody attended to me but when I waved to a young chap he came over immediately. He check out my feet and recommended me a neutral support (880). He helped me to decide between getting a pair of really nice looking shoes vs a pair of suitable one.  Thumbs up to him for his knowledge! Just came back from my run and this is really comfy especially around the ankle! Look for him when you are there:)",

From the moment we walked in, she greeted us with a warm and friendly smile, instantly making us feel welcomed. Not only did she provide excellent customer service, but she also went above and beyond by engaging in pleasant small talks, making the experience even more enjoyable. What stood out about Helen was her genuine approach; she never tried to force sell any products or services, which was truly refreshing. I highly recommend Helen for her exceptional service and commendable professionalism.",
