Elizabeth Toh,5,"Teacher Mandy is an exceptional educator who goes above and beyond for her students. My son attended her School Readiness Programme for over a year, and her dedication has been truly remarkable.

Her 3-hour sessions are structured to mimic a real primary school environment, complete with schoolwork periods and recess - preparing children perfectly for their transition to Primary 1.

The most impressive moment was how she handled my son's anxiety about taking the school bus. When I mentioned he was resistant to single-deck buses (because he wanted double-deck buses) and having emotional meltdowns, Teacher Mandy didn't just listen - she took immediate action. By the next class, she had prepared a custom social story to help him understand and cope by validating his needs, explanations and options. Her intervention was gentle, professional, and effective.

While I'm sad our partnership is ending now that my son has started Primary 1, I'm immensely grateful for her support during this transition period.

Highly recommended for parents seeking a compassionate and strategic approach to school readiness!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100131082989667417491/reviews

Her expertise and dedication have been instrumental in his progress.

In addition, we greatly appreciate the positive and nurturing environment of the center, which has significantly contributed to our overall experience.

genevieve,5,"Having found TLC has been one of the greatest blessings for my daughter. We’ve been to so many places in the past 2.5 years and none of them match up.
What I really love most about TLC is their careful selection of teachers. They have quality staff with years of experience.

I started my daughter with ST and then added on the full day classes. The classes are so well planned and executed. They incorporate cookery, sensory play along with OT and ST seasons for the kids in the full day programme.

Highly recommend TLC to anyone looking for quality services for their kid.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117792779864572253188/reviews
