      "text": "Takeaway their $5 value set of Herbal Drumstick & Braised Pork Belly and found them pretty well executed and rather value for money.\n\nHowever, having their Bak Kut Teh on site was a disappointment. Having meat balls and pork belly added to the mix doesn't made you a Klang style BKT, the broth was neither herbal nor thick, in no way resemble anything like those at Klang. And rather than providing multiple ingredients at such miserable portions(even the soup), would prefer to have just a decent portion of pork rib.",
