Kiran Chauhan,1,"Have stored with them for past more than 3 years. When I retrieved the box, the delivery guy expected me to pick 6 heavy box at lobby. Then when during delivery dropped my boxes twice on the street near my home. Few of the glass items broken.

When I call customer service then ask for the photos and said will investigate. After 4 days and 2 reminders, the answer was that I SHOULD HAVE NOT STORED FRAGILE in the box. Really????

I read the condition 4(d). Nothing mention about Fragile items.

Not even a apology from them. DO NOT STORE WITH THEM.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107350065508202229912/reviews
