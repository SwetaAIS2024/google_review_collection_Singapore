I had made an order for buns self-collection days prior to collection date and even sent them a few messages before heading over to collect but was made to wait 45mins just to collect some buns. The admin personnel attending to me was nonchalant too even after I told her I was in a rush. The sales personnel I contacted with via WhatsApp is very slow in replying and inefficient too.",

Accounts demand payment before delivery of goods and if accounts or admin fails to respond to our order in time, we are penalised and will not receive our order despite payment. Seriously ridiculous. And now, it’s Saturday 230pm. We ordered for delivery of goods on Thursday way before order cut off time and they informed that there were too much order for Friday delivery and we will receive order on Sat. Now, we do not receive any order and calls or messages were just ignored. Seriously, I hope the boss can read this and do something about your team.",

Was told to come here and collect document according to the app and later on I had to call the person contact thru the app and told me the location but  never say building name and came here to check the reception doesn’t know what I’m talking about. I walk rounds buildings to building just to find the location.\n\nNext day came again and the receptionist recognised my face again and before tat called the sender from the app told me the building\nwhen all along she could have atleast told me the day before the name of the building and I was making rounds alone around this place alone the day before\n\nAnd had to travel from my house come back again jus to collect document which is stupid thing to do, waste my time,energy and effort and money",
