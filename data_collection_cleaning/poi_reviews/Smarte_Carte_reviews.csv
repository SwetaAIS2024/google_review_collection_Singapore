Anni E,4,"They now cost $11.00 for hand carry bags weighing less than 10kls. Our big luggage weighing 23kls cost $16.00 and that’s good for 24hrs. A bit pricey because we had 5 hand carry luggage’s and I 23kl luggage but our flight isn’t until midnight, we wanted to explore Jewel and we’ve checked out of our hotel so this is the lesser of two evils kind of thing.

They take card and cash.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113279172452991418751/reviews
Roshni,2,"Quite expensive if you are storing for more than 1 or 2 days - it’s probably cheaper to just check your bag in with you, even for a short journey! The most frustrating thing was that they require the person whose passport was registered at the time of leaving the bag to be present at the time of collection. Fine, except the baggage receipt does not say the name of the collector, nor does it state this requirement. Difficult for a group to be expected to remember the person whose passport was handed over when it has been left for a week. The person at the desk showed us no compassion when handling this, despite the fact that our grandmother was in a wheelchair in the other terminal, and this was why the passport holder wasn’t present. Do better",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114773678240856356466/reviews
Jane Jane,1,"It’s not easy to find, you finally locate it and then the service is unattended with a phone to call for assistance and a warning that it will take minimum 20 mins for an attendant to come and receive your bag, and  another 20 min wait when you want to retrieve your bag.  This is not mentioned in any of the Smart Carte info.  Not a great experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114554742224744819066/reviews
