Ivan K,5,"First time trying. Didn't know Selera Rasa actually is a joint venture of Crave nasi lemak. Came on a Tuesday morning Ard 10.30 am and there are quite a number of patrons queuing up. It took around 15 mins of wait and I ordered royal flush set.

The Nasi Lemak is above average, I find it better than the crave, maybe becos of the freshly cook wings. The rice is light and fragrant, paired with the slightly sweet sambal is heavenly. Definitely a must try if you come to Adam road food center.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115562172613538213642/reviews
Wendy S,3,"Happened to be at the area and decided to join the long q with no context. On a public holiday at 10am, queued for about 45minutes. The fried chicken was great. The coconut rice lacks the coconut flavour. Can try if there’s no queue, otherwise give it a missed.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113025785465391964736/reviews
Ong Zhi Yuan,4,"Selera Nasi Lemak came highly recommended by colleagues, so I was excited to give it a try. While the meal was good, I felt that it didn’t quite live up to the hype.

I ordered the Royal Flush ($6.50), which came with basmati rice, ikan bilis, peanuts, a chicken wing, otah, bergedil, and a decent portion of sambal chilli.

To give credit where it’s due, the rice was fluffy, fragrant, and well-cooked, and the sambal was spicy with a nice umami kick. Unfortunately, the rest of the ingredients were pretty average. The biggest letdown was the chicken wing—it was crispy but lacked flavour, as if it hadn’t been marinated properly.

On the bright side, the staff were really friendly, and the food was served quickly, which made the experience smooth.

Overall, it wasn’t a bad meal, but I’ve had better nasi lemak elsewhere. If you’re already in the area, it’s worth a try, but I wouldn’t go out of my way for it. 7/10.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104417804420531473764/reviews
Caleb Lim,5,"I tried this Nasi Lemak 30 yrs ago & I think they retained much of their quality & standards, though I cannot say the same for their offshoot Crave. It is good to be back to savour this familiar taste & enjoy the friendly Adam Road hawker ambience in the morning.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114360608933061462525/reviews
Alia Hamdi,5,"My #1 nasi lemak place in Singapore! I love the begedil, otah and fried chicken paired together with the flavourful basmati rice.
The sambal has some kick to it too, not too spicy and not sweet making your breakfast a really satisfying one.
10/10 would recommend!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102883656833775864047/reviews
