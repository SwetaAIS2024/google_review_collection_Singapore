Niniyana Rohani,1,"I visited with my family of nine for drinks, and I must express my disappointment with the service we received. The attitude displayed by the management trainee, Cecelia, was entirely unacceptable. While it is possible she may have been having a difficult day, her body language, tone of voice, and the way she threw the scoop after serving a glass of ice reflected poor customer service.

Such behavior is especially disappointing given that this establishment is located at the prestigious Changi Airport Terminal 3, which is known for high standards of service. I sincerely hope that Cecelia is guided and trained on the importance of proper customer service, professionalism, and respectful conduct. After all, we are paying customers who deserve to be treated with courtesy.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115547944658437010019/reviews
Riz Khan,3,"A wide variety of cafe brunch options, although many options are lean to the sweet side. Most dishes come with fruit in the side salad and sweet fruit reduction. It's counter service but works well. The sitting area is a little tight, but the setup helps break things up. Eggs are normally served soft, so it's worth requesting your preference. Cakes are rich and sweet but big enough to share",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106698402559643276501/reviews
Jarred Pereira,2,"Ordered the ""I love you berry much"" and the chocolate pistachio cake and a drink.
They charged us for a coffee + cake combo and an a la carte cake. We didn't notice they gave us the Rocher cake + choc pistachio.
So I went back to the counter to say that we didn't order the Rocher cake. How come this cake was given and now the young looking staff was telling me I needed to pay another $3.80 without explaining properly and even ignoring me and the questions I was asking.
Eventually saving my breath, I just paid the $3.80.
This same young staff plated the correct cake this time, BUT she flung the plate unto the tray for me to take.
I was stunned and all I could tell her was ""I love her attention to Customer Service.""
I simply wanted to have a nice dessert and cup of tea with my wife. And this was such a spoiler to the night.
I do hope this staff will be taken to task.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111702821223058619782/reviews
Will,4,"Came through arrival early in the morning. There is still a fine selection of food.

Place is clean and comfortable. Food is great too.

A pity no charging point.

Handphone is near to flat after the flight.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118119525043286062929/reviews
