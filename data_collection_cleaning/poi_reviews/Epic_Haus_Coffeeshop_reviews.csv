Jen W.,3,Had western food.  Aglio Olio with chicken chop $8.90.  The chicken chop was alright but this is the first time I see noodles done this way using sambal chilli oil rather than olive oil.  So oily I couldn‚Äôt eat all the noodles.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101265945503153679685/reviews
Orla,5,"Mind blown by the pork noodle; its the traditional Teochew style. The pork liver was perfectly cooked. Good price, $4.80! I almost ordered a second bowl. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

The lok lok lived up to expectations. The broccoli could be crispier. The mantou remained crispy even when it wasn't warm!

This place feels like a hidden gem. I was surprised when I came at 7:30 pm Friday night for dinner; there were a lot of empty tables.

The only problem is there's always strong second-hand smokeüö¨, even though I'm seated indoors. Throughout my whole dinner, at least 30 minutes spent here, the second-hand smoke kept coming in almost non-stop. To the extent that after I left, the cigarette smell still lingered in my nostrils. üòë

The management should really do something about this. It's not so friendly for families with young children and people who can't tolerate cigarette smell.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100793047415504287130/reviews

Robin Lee,5,"They have mookota, hotpot, and chicken pot. Reasonable prices for a wide range of dishes including beef, lamb, pork, and a variety of vegetables. However, I prefer chicken pot because it is more to my liking. Also, the friendly staff that takes her time explaining to us. Will come back again for sure!! Jiayou!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113413536454304909902/reviews
Jonathan Koh,2,"In this coffee shop, so far I think only Fatty seafood and the mixed rice stall can make it, the rest are mediocre or even below average. This coffee shop was dead and miserable a year ago until Fatty Seafood starts its operation. Food from Fatty is excellent and economical, suitable for family and individuals. The only setback about this place is the lack of management, I guess. The fat drink woman who serves drinks in the evening is lazy and spent most of the time chitchatting. Toilet doesn't even have a mirror and run down compared to other brands of chain-stores.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110322417305771163637/reviews
