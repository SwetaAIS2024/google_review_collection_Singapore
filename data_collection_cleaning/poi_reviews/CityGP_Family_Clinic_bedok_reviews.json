He asked to see my E-card first?!\n\nAnd it feels like he‚Äôs just trying to sell me something like a salesperson and feels like the doctor is trying to scare me by saying my condition is so bad. End up taking the influenza /covid test and it was negative and I had to pay $40 more. Doctor even had to justify ‚Äúbecause he‚Äôs the one doing it‚Äù\n\nWill never come back again.",

      "text": "Unfortunately i cant leave a zero star review, if can i would put it as zero. Beware guys... Today is Saturday and its quite hard to find a GP that is open in the afternoon. Happen to google up and saw this clinic is open so we headed down.\n\nOn 29/01/22 at 1.36pm we visited CityGP Family Clinic (Blk 122 Bedok North st 2). They told us there were 4 patients ahead of us. They claimed they'd call us when our turn was next. So we didn't mind waiting and walked around the neighbourhood.\n\nAt about 3pm, no call was made and we decided to check on our queue status. The staff said our turn was next and told us to wait inside the clinic. One patient out, so our turn was next, right? We thought so but no, the doctor, Dr Kwok Chun Lin, came out of the consultation room and called for the lady who would be doing a pre departure test. I approached the staff to clarify that it was supposed to be our turn and she said the test was a quick one. Fine. As soon as she came out, Dr Kwok called the next patient who registered after us upon arrival.\n\nBy then, it was already 3.50pm and no more patients, just us! Only after we asked why they skipped us and brought the later patients in,  he then apologised and offered to take us in immediately which we turned him down. He could not even explained why it took 2 hours to consult 4 patients which was being told by the front staff earlier on.\n\nThe lame justifications he made were 'not enough doctor' and they had 'appointment based' patients.\n\nMy point of view, if you are not able to manage new cases (walk in) due to the shortage of manpower, you shouldn't be taking in more registrations and give empty promises making patients wait for 2hrs. This is just a GP, not a polyclinic. Even polyclinics have improve on their service.",

      "text": "I am writing on behalf of my friend who visited the clinic on 30 June 2024 Sunday and my review is true and honest review.\n\nI read from other reviews that the doctor refer the patient to A&E for blood test.\n\nWhen I consulted doctor today, he referred me to A&E for blood test due to my face having some redness and swollen symptoms.\n\nWhen discussing the issue, I had told doctor clearly that I have no difficulty in breathing and all I wanted was some cream and anti biotic or anti histamine.\n\nHe refused prescribe any cream or medicine to lighten my allergic symptom and insist I visit A&E for blood test.\n\nI was shocked as he just printed the referral slip and told me that he will not charged me for any medications just consultation.\n\nI was speechless!\n\nFurthermore, he didn't even offer me any mc as I wasn't feeling well for work tomorrow.\n\nDo not visit this clinic if you are expecting some prescription of medications.\n\nI do not question the doctor professionalism but it seems to me that the risk appetite of the doctor is small or either he is overly cautious...\n\nReview is for yr reference. Make yr own choice",
