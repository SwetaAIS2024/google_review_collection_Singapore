Y F,5,"Excellent Service and Professional Team!

I had a fantastic experience at K√§rcher Center. The staff was professional, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful from start to finish. They diagnosed the issue quickly and repaired my vacuum cleaner efficiently free of charge.

The customer service was outstanding. I highly recommend to anyone in need of reliable and honest repair services.

Thank you for the great service! I‚Äôll definitely be returning if I ever need repairs in the future.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106008292615394469945/reviews
Mun Chong Wong,5,"I was at the Service Centre at 905 am today,, my v cleaner cannot be powered up, the front desk technician that spoke to me was super patient with me, he checked the plug head and said politely  to wait for him cos' he can get it fixed on the spot. I left the centre at 920 am. He knows his work, his eagerness to help me and politeness make the brand so world class. I have been here 2-3 times over the years and the customer experience never fails me. This should set an example for many other brands to learn and follow. Great Job!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100876024471534455363/reviews
janetchongsc,1,"I am a regular user of wet vacuum.
Recently i tried using karcher wet vacuum, nearly 2 k for a no standard n disappointing vacuum.
It cuts my fingers and the brush needs to remove all dirt, dust every single use. I knew we need to remove the water every use but the filter is so dirty, the dirt n dust does not suck into the water. The cleaning is worse than using simple dry vacuum. Will never trust this.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116482242490918054308/reviews
