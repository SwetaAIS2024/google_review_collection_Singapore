Vanessa SLH,5,"Been purchasing their premium vegetables- Kang Kong, xiao bai Cai, round and sharp spinach through redmart-Lazada! Every purchase don’t disappoint. The vegetables are really fresh and leafy. Their premium round & sharp spinach are always my first choice in choosing the right ingredient for stirred fry veggie or spinach soup! I have visited their farmer market a few times and purchased the soiled grown lettuce that is only exclusive for the farmer market.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100507181681323793548/reviews
Sherman Lau,5,"Have an awesome variety of vegetables and very clean/well prepared. Since it's soil grown, sometimes you will expect soil but they are very very well prepared. Loving the Sharp spinach which is really delicious upon making overnight banchan, simply delicious!

Also since their veges are easily accessible at Fairprice Finest/Xtra, it makes things sooooo much easier for us to get their veges. Support local and for sure, 5/5 stars from me~!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109793930559562137242/reviews
