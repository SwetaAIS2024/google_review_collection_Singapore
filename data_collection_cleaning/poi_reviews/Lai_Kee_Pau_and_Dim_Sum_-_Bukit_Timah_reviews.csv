Yen Trinh,5,"I always thought affordable neighborhood dim sum places don't exist anymore, and then I stumbled upon Lai Kee.

It's a small dim sum place (restaurant would be too grand a word) in Toh Yi HDB estate. The space is tight but tidy, and I admire them for providing such an extensive menu of dim sum items, noodles and drinks at such affordable prices while not being inside a hot crowded food court. Service was prompt and friendly. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Is this the best dim sum I've tried in my life? Clearly no! But for the price I paid and the neighborhood vibes (you see aunties catching up with friends, uncles reading Straits Times), I will gladly be back again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106124579273314676288/reviews
Stevez Chua,2,"Actually we have been eating from this store Mee Hoon Kueh a few times. Food is quite tasty. One time when i was doing a take away, i noticed the lady didnt use glove to make kueh. And she was talking with the guy next to her and touching a stationary next to her, all while pinching my kueh. This is totally unhygienic in my view and when i looked at her....she sheepishly stopped touching the stationary. Whey....how can you do that, even though i know the kueh will evebtually be boiled in water? Probably wouldnt patronise this shop moving forward. A pity.... hygiene issue",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105409105118549183020/reviews
Donald Isaac,4,"Chances upon this place so decided to go try out their Dim Sum.

They have a decent spread of dim sum. Quality could be improved a bit more for a budget conscious place.

Food was served pretty quick. The porridge was not to my liking at all. But the dim sum and other items was fine.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111620843433357170307/reviews
Riki Koe,5,"One of my fave dim sum place. With a lot of varieties of dim sum, fresh & serve  piping hot ðŸ˜‹
