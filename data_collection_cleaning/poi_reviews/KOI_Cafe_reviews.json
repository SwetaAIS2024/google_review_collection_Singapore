Koi’s drinks standard had been on a steep decline. I was a diamond member last year, but find myself drinking less and less these couple of months. Really disappointing.",

But requiring her to make 19 transactions of payments separately and then issuance of cards is ridiculously slow, that holds up the queue. Meanwhile , no orders can be made. When questioned, the 5 staff kept quiet. You need to reflect on your procedures, productivity, systems.",
