Asheesh Gupta,5,"It could be a must visit.
Tho i wouldn't recommend buying tickets in advance.
There are exhibitions on site and their tickets are available on-site. You might need to buy tickets for exhibitions upon arrival.

The outside has a shallow pond with lilly. Its beautiful and calm. I would recommend seating on the pond side and admire the Lilly and the tiny little fish.
The exhibitions were detailed and worth the price, i liked the one with lights.
They have a cafeteria and toilets.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103289634858636555331/reviews
William Lin,5,"Great place to check out especially on a rainy day. We visited the Mirror Mirror Journey Into the Mind exhibition here. You explore different areas behind different coloured doors.  Each area is different and offers a different feel. The kids enjoyed it, especially the interactive aspect. However, you need to watch your kids as they can easily get lost in the crowd",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100537437524494981031/reviews
Alice Lau (Girl in a Food Frenzy),4,"A very popular place, nice to stop by when you need a break from shopping and enjoy the cooler inside.

It always pays to check in person, even though the booking site online said it was full, we were able to get in to see an exhibit Future World which was breathtaking.

My only thoughts are I was with my mother who is slightly elderly and my son (who is young) and there was very little
seating inside the exhibit.

Great facilities though and beautiful surroundings with wonderful viewpoints all round!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105847246233330337898/reviews
Eng.Mohammed Esam,5,"I didnâ€™t go inside the ArtScience Museum, but the architecture alone is stunning and definitely worth photographing. Its unique lotus-shaped design makes it one of the most iconic landmarks around Marina Bay. A great spot for photos, especially around sunset.ðŸŒ¸ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¶",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115173710282810186199/reviews
Vignesh Balaji,5,"This place is really cool for young kids. Theyâ€™ve made a very nice experience. Itâ€™s a fun time we had over here, enjoying the different areas like the painting area. Unlike a traditional museum, this place is filled with technology. There a plenty of activities for kids to enjoy. You can paint your sketch and get into these mixed reality screens. Itâ€™s so cool.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114775681088492237892/reviews
