Teoh Louis,5,"The Van Gogh exhibition left me with a deep sense of sadness for his tragic life, but also a profound admiration for his relentless passion for art. Despite his struggles, his commitment to painting shines through in every brushstroke, capturing emotion and color in ways that continue to resonate today. The addition of music, graphics, and animation enhanced the experience, bringing his world to life in a captivating way. It’s heartening to see his legacy celebrated, knowing that his genius, once overlooked, is now recognized and admired worldwide.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102355023855809404850/reviews
Pat Gee,5,"The exhibition featuring Van Gogh was very well crafted. I love how it ignited some of my sensory all at once to immerse the viewer with a moving narration.
I also want to say a big thank you to the ticketing officer Victor? Yesterday for helping me purchase my ticket. All worth the money spent and my effort to get there in the rain. The Park view building was quite impressive too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105180261891682512074/reviews
Jeslyn Chin,2,"The additional temporary seatings placed on the floor area jeopardized the whole experience. Not only did they block the view of people seating in the front row of the original seating, they also blocked the overall aesthetics effects and photo-taking effects.  Highly disappointing.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115819778291645655762/reviews
Sc,1,"Very much agreed with another commenter, whom highlighted that not to bring young children though it was stated that “All ages are welcome”. The exhibition was created to be a visually immersive experience with lights and sounds, but then expect children to sit still and be quiet for at least 30 min. There  are moving images from 4 walls and the floor and from the ads, I thought it will be something like the future world in MBS where children can walked freely however that was not the case. This was not make know to parents until we were ready to enter into the exhibition and was not explained clearly that there will be a 15min “real” interactive session only after the 1st 35min. ! If children are not allowed to move freely, then please highlight in the T&Cs!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105105226654086026319/reviews
