Wilson is very helpful and patiently assisted me to change to a new loyalty Koi card, transferred the balance from my old card to the new one and took my drink order. Thank you for the pleasant experience.",

      "text": "Koi has always been a family favourite drink.  But my recent experience at the Waterway Point outlet was quite an unpleasant one.  The management should really work on improving the ordering process. There is a sign on the counter that says orders should be placed by using the kiosk.  I was placing my order on the kiosk, when the young lady behind me cut the queue and went straight to the counter to order and pay.  And the staff there attended to her and processed her order first, even though i was next in line.  This is in fact penalising customers who actually follow your process and order through the kiosk.\n\nApparently, all you need to do is tell the cashier that you \"don't know\" how to use the kiosk, then they will let you order at the counter and pay. Then what is the point of asking customers to use the kiosk?? Most of Koi customers are young and tech savvy, so it's sometimes quite obvious that they are just using this reason as an excuse to \"cut queue\".  One minute they are scrolling social media on their iphones, and the next minute suddenly they don't know how to use the kiosk to order?\n\nPlease improve your ordering process and train your staff properly, Waterway Point Koi team.",
