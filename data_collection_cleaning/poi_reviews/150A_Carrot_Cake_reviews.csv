Sam Wong,5,"Finally, I got to have this carrot cake after coming twice and was told already closed! The carrot cake is soft, fresh with a good amount of eggs.

Ck ck,4,"I actually had trouble finding the stall as there are a couple of coffeeshops at block 150A üòÇ. So for easier reference, they are located opposite the Yang Ming seafood.
Am very happy to see younger owners at the stall, and very polite and overall service level is very good. They even have preorder options and you can call to place the orders.
Food wise, the black carrot cake was good and not overly sweet which I read from other reviews. It is good and will come back for their carrot cake again. Keep up the good work!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107376743335719280174/reviews
Gourmet Deli,4,"I would give it 5 stars but I‚Äôm afraid I might find someone even better. But, truly shocking is the chef de Pattie is actually a tall young bespectacled young man. I‚Äôm a back carrot cake lover and this guy delivers it all. Even when packed, the aroma spills out like a ripen goodness of a durian. The taste hits the post all over and all over again with every mini plastic fork-full. Bib gourmand should find them as a new entrant in their annual report on whose who of great hawker food. Simply the best üëçüëçüëç.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103389958183008600347/reviews
Otoko Otoko,5,"I had a wonderful plate of the black carrot cake, served piping hot. The carrot cake was on the sweeter note side (the way I like them), it was moist and every piece was well coated with the dark sauce. I had the $4 plate, and it was a good-sized portion - definitely filled my tummy with yummilious carrot cake and egg.

There was also a good balance of umami and Wok Hey to the dish, well worth the calories and indulgence. And the travel all the way from Tampines to Bishan!

Owned by a young couple, with great positive attitude and naturally, the food was cooked with passion. The stall was also kept thoroughly clean. Hope more Customers will support this couple in their business venture!  :)",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115694311840265387035/reviews
