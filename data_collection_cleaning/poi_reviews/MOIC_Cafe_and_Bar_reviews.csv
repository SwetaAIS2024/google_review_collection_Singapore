Kelvin C,1,"This review is more of a FYI for those coming to the cafe and not purchasing anything.

Was here today after visiting the museum and it was empty hence we thought to just sit down on one of the “sofa” to rest while planning where to go next.

Shortly after a staff came over and question us if we are waiting for anyone and told us that the seats here are for paying customer only and that the waiting area is way up ahead nearer to the museum.

Granted I did not purchase anything at the cafe (did buy a scented candle, 2 premium ticket and a birthday pass at the museum) but I thought that since the cafe was linked to the museum and there was virtually nobody (less the one staff manning the cafe) we could at least sit there for awhile.

I guess we were affecting business being there or they had some strict cleanliness regime where they had to clean anywhere a person sat after they leave and me being a non paying patron gave them more troubles without spending at the cafe.

They have every right to chase me away but considering the way it was said and it being empty but this really left a bad taste and experience for me and I will definitely not consider coming back.

To think I had such a good experience and impression of them after the Plaza Singapura event they had during the Xmas and it was that event that made me go for the museum today.

Really disappointing.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110635667708693646864/reviews
Mimi Chahal,2,"Took my toddler yesterday after nursery. Great space, pleased the museum now has a cafe that's open to the public but the ice cream was rubbish. We got the Barbie/vanilla and the Cereal Milk and didn't eat either. Tasted very artificial and the texture was grainy. I expected far better from a cafe of a museum that's dedicated to ice cream. Unfortunately they didn't offer tasters but I can't imagine the other ice creams being much better. Shame but we won't be coming back, there's far better ice cream elsewhere in Dempsey.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115696822554990897589/reviews
