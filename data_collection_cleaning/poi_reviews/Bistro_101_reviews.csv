Alex Lim,4,"Went on Sunday night. Totally empty.

Food is ok. Service is good. The lady staff was alone, had to serve table and cook concurrently.

There's games for us to play, e.g table soccer, pool, darts.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116892180143185379722/reviews
Pearlyn GYT,5,"This could well be our new favourite place to hang out - a cosy and spacious bistro with fun activities and yummy, affordable food.

I was pleasantly surprised by the grilled fish with fries as it was different than what is usually served elsewhere. With every purchase of a main, you get free flow iced lemon tea for just $3, and can have a go at the darts machines (starting from $2) too. The other table games are free to play, and they have billards, table soccer and old school video games.

Staff was friendly too - we look forward to be back again!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105538956700519868571/reviews
Perry Pacific,4,"Amazing find on ground floor of an Industrial Commercial Office Building along Eunos.
If not for their banner along main road, one might just miss this place ... I suggest slowing down .... this building is just next to the Hafary Showroom building.
Upon entering, you will be surprised by the interior decor the owner had put into.
A big dining area, another section with dart game machines and high chairs.
The ordering station is at the center, where their friendly staff will explain and take your orders.
We ordered their Grilled Boneless Chicken which was succulant and nicely presented with fries and salad.
Their smoked duck salad came in a big bowl, with generous meat servings.
Ordered a jug of beer to round up the meal.
There is a Special Offer now where every 2 orders, you get to choose the 3rd item at only $1.00 .... get more details from their friendly staffs ...
You can park at the building's multi-storey car park, take the lift to ground floor, go thru the main door, walk towards side of building.
A nice place to chill with friends .. family ..",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106976202381869635330/reviews
V “Bottega” Lau,5,"The fish and chips were very enjoyable as the fish was crispy and well executed. The salad was well balanced with the different vegetables and the sesame sauce.  We like the atmosphere and the kids were thrilled with the dart board and mini billard table.   To top this experience up, there was a free refill for the thirst quenching ice lemon tea . The chicken wing was well marinated as I did not need any sauce.  This is our third visit in a short span of 1 month.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112261865457220228281/reviews
Zael Timothy,5,"My favorite restaurant in Singapore!
The food they serve just beautiful, healthy, and prepared with care.
It’s affordable at ~$6 for a set meal!

My husband and I each received beautiful presented rice colored slightly with blue butterfly pea flour for added health, and wealth, alongside the sides that came with each of our respective meals.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113940045491584557518/reviews
