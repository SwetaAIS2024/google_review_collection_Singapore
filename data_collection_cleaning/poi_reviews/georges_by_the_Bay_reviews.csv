Henry Cheng,5,"The relaxed atmosphere made for a very enjoyable evening, and the service was good‚Äîfriendly and attentive staff ensured we were well taken care of.

The highlight of my meal was undoubtedly the rib eye steak cooked medium‚Äîit was absolutely fantastic, bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. On the other hand, the beer battered fish and chips left a bit to be desired, as it was a tad soggy. Despite this, the overall quality of the food was commendable.

What really stood out to me were the very friendly alcohol prices. It's not often you find a place that offers great drinks without breaking the bank.

Great place to chill out with family and friends.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151994390288524704/reviews
Christine Ho,4,The place can be quite noisy during weekend nights if you want  just want to chill. Two shops away is a place where there is a live Chinese band. The carbonara pasta was below expectation..taste was a bit off...not sure what was in the sauce. The baby back ribs and sliders were ok.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116064847335657733508/reviews
P Sav,4,"Mixed review on this place‚Ä¶ location really nice, staff very helpful, polite and a speedy service; however two of the food choices could have been better. The belly pork was not crispy and the Lava Cake was cold (still ate it all as the ice cream was delicious). Overall a nice place and I‚Äôll visit again, but maybe a bit more attention to detail on the cooking.

Would have also been nice if they served coffee, but they don‚Äôt.

Overall a 7/10 but I will return üôè",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114574123100555488275/reviews
Gear Oil Cafe,1,"The worst cooks in Singapore!
You should fire whoever worked as the cook on Sunday evening.
Serving staff were helpful and great, very friendly, polite, worked hard to serve the guests.
It was the cook/s in the kitchen that made for this One Star Review. Took over 45 min for the second last one of my guests to receive their food. And took 50min for the last person to receive theirs.
Completely disappointed üòû
On the plus side, the foods always good.
But it shouldn't take 15min to get chips and dip. And you should ABSOLUTELY NEVER serve the first plate 30min apart from the last plate. SAD.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102313543756447059363/reviews
Jlor,5,"Nestled just beside the beach, this restaurant, discreetly positioned at the far end of the second level, required a bit of exploration to locate.

Though not overly spacious, it comfortably accommodates groups of 6-8 people per table.

Our family gathered here for a delightful dinner, and to our pleasant surprise, the food portions were generous.

The chicken popcorn won over the kids, while my daughter thoroughly enjoyed the creamy and flavorful carbonara.

Even my usually reserved son couldn't help but praise the deliciousness of the beef burger.

Personally, I found the restaurant's ambiance charming, creating a perfect backdrop for a delightful evening with family, complemented by the gentle sea breeze. A truly memorable dinner experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104974466203495354099/reviews
