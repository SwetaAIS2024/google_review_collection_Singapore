      "text": "I recently visited SKN for a skincare treatment, and I couldn’t be more impressed. From the moment I walked in, the staff - June was warm and welcoming, creating a relaxing atmosphere. The facility was spotless and well-organized, which immediately put me at ease.\n\nDuring my consultation, June took the time to understand my concerns and tailored a treatment plan specifically for me. Her expertise and attention to detail made me feel confident in the process. The treatment itself was comfortable, and I appreciated the follow-up care instructions provided.\n\nAfter just a few sessions, I noticed a remarkable improvement in my skin. I’ve received countless compliments and feel more confident than ever. I highly recommend June from SKN to anyone looking for professional and effective beauty treatments. I will definitely be returning!",
