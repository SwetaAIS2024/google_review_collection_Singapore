      "text": "Came because I had Grabfood-ed their chicken wings and was really impressed. Both the salted egg chicken wings and chili crab chicken wings were super impressive tender and fall off the bone!\n\nAt the restaurant, tried their dry aged ribeye which was slightly on the dry side but paired with a really good beef jus and blue pea seasoning salt. Their baby pork ribs were juicy and also fall off the bone. This time we also tried their sesame yuzu chicken wings which were my parents favourite! My mum said that based on the aglio olio, can tell that the rest of the food will be great, and she was not wrong!!\n\nReally impressed and look forward to going again :) will bring some friends over for drinks soon",

Prompt and attentive service.\n\nWagyu rib on hot stone. Oil fats will splatter so grill with caution. But meat was good. Good for 4 pax.\nDuck and mango pizza. Taste good together. Not a bad combination.\nSalted egg chicken wing was well coated yet not too salty.\nTruffle fries was crispy and not greasy unlike other places drenching it in truffle oil.",

I could hear most of the convo between the wait staff and the kitchen about it. They served the next half rack in the end, and I felt they were generous about it because it came with all the sides as well - I was just expecting a plain plate of an extra half rack. We got the cheese fries. The blanket of cheese was unexpected, appearance wise but it was yummy nonetheless. Drinks were good. Maybe something to note is mosquitoes? I got 3 mosquito bites on my legs while there, indoors. Overall a good experience.",
