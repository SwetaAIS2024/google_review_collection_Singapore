Carol Lay Eng Ong,5,"If you want to know what are Buddha's teachings in English and Chinese, this is the place to learn. I had called myself a Buddhist for a long time but I know Buddha's teachings superficially. Yet like learning golf, you need to learn to learn the right strokes from the very beginning from an experienced golf instructor, without correction later on. This is the place with the right lineage and therefore right teachings. I am speaking from personal experience.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112561075389888737961/reviews
