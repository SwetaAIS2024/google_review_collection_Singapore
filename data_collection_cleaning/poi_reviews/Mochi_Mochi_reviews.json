We opt for their sukiyaki set that‚Äôs super value-for-money!\nThe sukiyaki is served in a shallow cast-iron pot filled with tons of thinly sliced Angus beef alongside with vegetables, mushrooms, tofu and konjac noodles.\nLove their scrumptious and addictive soup base that‚Äôs bursting with sweet, salty and savoury flavour. ‚ô•Ô∏è",
