Ong Zhi Yuan,4,"This boon tong kee has been around for a while, and over the years, it has always delivered delicious, family oriented dishes at affordable prices. They are also well known for their chicken and chicken rice.

They also do reunion and new year dinners, with great varieties in their sets each year, catered for 6 and 10 people.

Would recommend if you are in the area for a family dinner or just grabbing a quick bite. While not cream of the crop, their food has never failed to disappoint. 8/10~",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104417804420531473764/reviews
Nicole Kim,5,"Really enjoyed dinner here, especially the chicken rice. The vegetable dish was also a favorite. The service was great and very accommodating for a large group spread across two tables. Every dish that we shared was delicious and the beer paired well with all the dishes. Highly recommend!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118129559408373781633/reviews
Daryl Koh,2,"5 stars for the pig liver Kai lan. Super flavourful, no blood taste, tender and all round fantastic.
2 stars for the chicken rice. Really expensive for the portion and average flavour profile. The Rice taste like normal white rice.
May come back to try the other dishes.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106011451543851178264/reviews
Evelyn Ong,4,"The food quality is above average but a bit pricey. However, the service is good and the place can feel a bit cramped. Missed out the chicken photo.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103024776608801642514/reviews
Si Lei Agnes Goh,4,"Had my family dinner here on a weekend. Service is good and prompt. Food is not bad, we ordered whole chicken, ginger onion fish, tofu and kailan though nothing stands out in particular. Rice is average, but ginger sauce is pretty nice. Fuss-free dinner place.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116102026795437651477/reviews
