      "text": "Update 28/2/2025\nRepeat orders for hot coffee drinks selections has been very diluted. Barely taste the coffee.\n\nOrdered a few times since they opened. Slowly trying all the menu in the list. So far all that i tried taste great except for the extra strong americano, It doesn't taste like extra but coffee is still good. Ordering is easy with the app. Thumbs up to staff who are keeping up with their speed to meet coffee lovers needs. Great service.\n\nYirgacheffe flat so far is my fav.",

      "text": "Luckin Coffee usually located at town area, this Waterfront Point branch was one of the rare branch at far housing area, another one at Tampines.\n\nIts located at main lobby area, beside Decathlon store. Particularly loved their coffee with coconut milk and many others interesting flavors. Of course many are C and D sugar level. But still have lots of B and Some A drinks for selection.\n\nGlad that Luckin Coffee coming into Singapore market, beside using good coffee beans and variety of flavors. They are very generous giving away big discounts voucher thru their Apps. Now good coffee become affordable, as compared to Starbucks that getting more expensive than before.\n\nDefinitely recommended Luckin Coffee.\n\nðŸ’¥ Welcome to my food sharing Instagram: jkgourmets. æ¬¢è¿Žæ¸¸è§ˆæˆ‘çš„ç¾Žé£ŸIG: jkgourmets",

      "text": "Wonderful coffee. Very good good taste. This Chinese brand can easily give Starbucks a run for its money.\n\nThe cheese velvet coffee is delicious. It has a very rich taste. Hope, once the promotions are over, they are not that expensive.\n\nA price point around $4-$5 should be good enough. But anything beyond that will be tough.",
