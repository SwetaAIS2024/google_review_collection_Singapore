Mysha Siti,5,"Had lunch today and itâ€™s our first time at Tanamera at Tanglin Mall. We had the Ayam Bumbu Rujak, Soto Betawi, Vanilla Latte and Lychee Tea. Everything was great and well seasoned especially Soto Betawi. The coffee blew me away and i decided to get my hands on the Espresso and Breakfast blend coffee capsules which are priced reasonably also i got some sample. The service crew ( Asri & Ashraf ) is also welcoming and service was fast. Outlet is well maintained and we love the theme. Looking forward to our next meal here to try out the other dishes and sweet treats.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108098016610486149353/reviews
Syams Shams,5,"My go-to latte whenever i needed my caffeine dose, especially in the morning. The bitterness is just nice and not too overpowered, doesn't leave too strong aftertaste either.

Their baristas are skillful, always amazed looking at them brewing the latte effortlessly. Asri and Yaya will always be my favourite baristas. Those latte arts are the plus points.

Their cold-brew coffee is also worth a try for those enjoy cold coffee. Keep calm and drink coffee â˜•",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107954708920871914113/reviews

Josh Kuek (#jkgourmets),4,"Indonesia cuisines was always an interesting and heart warming foods. Loved to see more Indonesia food like Tanamera open in Singapore.

First time trying Tanamera, was a unforgettable experience. It was actually different from local Malay cuisines, even it has similar foods like nasi goreng, Satay etc. But taste in fact was quite different.

We really liked their Nasi Goreng, a huge plate of 20 dollars fried rice with an egg, a whole fried chicken thigh, 2 pieces of chicken Satay. Fried rice was really good, full of wok-hey, can request non spicy if you can't take chilli, but I just request for less spicy instead, and it just taste nice.

The chicken thigh was really delicious too, juicy, moist, tender and fresh. Fried egg was not my type, I prefer fried egg with crispy edges. Satay with their unique peanut gravy sauce was very flavourful and delicious too.

Another interesting food was their fried tofu tempeh, so we'll fry and very delicious, not too heavy on tempeh, instead eating with tofu was just nice in flavors.

Coffee was good, meal experience was great. Price is slightly high but acceptable. I do recommend all to try it.
