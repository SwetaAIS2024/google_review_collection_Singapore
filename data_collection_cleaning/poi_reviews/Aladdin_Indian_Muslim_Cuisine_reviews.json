      "text": "Nasi Briyani Mutton $7sgd\n\nThe mutton cuts are good, making it easy to chew and not too tough.\n\nThe bastamit rice isnâ€™t very flavorful and fragrance  but the portion size is generous. The salad could use some improvement.\n\nThe sauce was okay, and there was no egg included. Overall, the price and portion are the deciding factor for 4stars\n\nmaking it an economical option for mutton biryani in the Punggol area, in my opinion",

Haven't been moved to put up a review for some time but for this, I will.\nThe roti pisang was not fluffy and a bit hard, but the fish curry was thick and flavourful. I also like the tasty and  flavourful biryani rice and masala chicken.\nDefinitely a keeper and a gem!",
