Saifu Angto,5,Small but has a good selection of fresh produce and basic pork and chicken selection.  Fairly large snack aisles and a little bit of everything else.  It's not usually super crowded so it's a super convenient place to grab and go during lunch break or after work before catching a bus or MRT which is right around the Alexandra Retail Centre,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
Runner Kao,5,"Just shopped at the NTUC FairPrice at Alexandra Retail Centre.

It is a small and compact Supermarket compared to their other branches. However, it is very well organised and neat where you can find almost anything you need.

FairPrice always provide better prices as compared to the convenience stores. Morever, parking at this mall is free in the evening where you can slowly enjoy your shopping and even dine at the restaurant after all is done.

There are also multiple self serve cashiers to help speed up the purchase process. The staff are also efficient and polite.

Highly recommended üòä",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106055160577192220530/reviews
Soo Hin Yeoh,4,A smallish FairPrice but at times it has discounted products other FairPrice does not carry. Better than the one at Telok Blangah but prefer the FairPrice Xtra at VivoCity or FairPrice Bukit Merah Central,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115725392210756907778/reviews
