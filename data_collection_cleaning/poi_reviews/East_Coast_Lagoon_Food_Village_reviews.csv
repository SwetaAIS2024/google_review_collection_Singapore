IUVA sg,4,"A legendary hangout since 1980s. The food centre has undergone many phases of change. It is usually at its maximum capacity on weekends and public holidays.
Some sitting areas are open space. Therefore it is not suitable during rainy season.
Otherwise, the place is quiet during noon of normal days but it gets pretty crowded during evening dinner.
Plenty of choices of local culinary. And its at affordable prices too.
After a heartful meal, take a walk at the park and enjoy the sea breeze. Now it is accessible if you take the brown line to Bayshore station.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116482140374075134171/reviews
Tee,5,"Lovely experience here!
'Haron Satay  & Chicken Wing Stall 55'
- excellent service
- delicious satay chicken skewers grilled fresh in front of you and try it with a nice rice cake

All up 10 skewers for $10 and $0.50 for the rice cake.

'Siam Thai Kitchen'
- ridiculously good flavours. Super authentic and we loved the service. Thanks to the young polite young man taking our order.
- mango salad is WOW and very fresh - we had to repeat. A bit of a kick to it.
- pineapple Fried Rice was also excellent that we also repeated it üòÖ

Highly recommend these two stalls.

Went around 4 30pm on a Sunday and it wasn't super crowded - there were a lottttttt of people at the beach though who in an hr or so were likely heading to those stalls next so I think we just missed the rush.

Lots of halal options and note that at the Thai place they use chicken floss, not pork floss üôè",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102336351798737738855/reviews
David Moh,4,"This is an open air food center with many seats and tables. There are many food stalls but when I was there many of the stalls were not open. This could be because it was a public holiday in Singapore. Nevertheless, food is delicious and considerably reasonable, given it is a popular place for visitors to East Coast Park.

The only negative point is that not all dining areas have fans, which is a must given our hot weather in Singapore and most visitors only visit East Coast Park during good sunny weather.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112451213464084221858/reviews
V AL,4,"Lovely place to hangout and eat a wide selection of local favorites. Do take note that the eatery would close occasionally to do a scheduled clean up, so do check in from time to time before you make your journey here.

Special shoutout to Stall 43 for their incredible Chili Crab and Golden Mantou. Crab was huge and very fresh, sauce was flavorful and not too sweet. Consistency was just perfect to dip the mantou in.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100836258965622565216/reviews
Lauren Lo,5,The best satay I‚Äôve had during my trip here!! Highly recommend the satay stall that grills right in front of you. Shrimp was fresh and the chicken/beef/mutton were cooked perfectly. We also ordered the sambal stingray - it was alright.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108423047811287498860/reviews
