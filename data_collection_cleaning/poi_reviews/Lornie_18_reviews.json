If you decide to use turn on the pipes, there is a high chance of pipe bursting.\n- ceiling of basement carpark cracking and with lots of holes forming. Rain water seaping through all the time.\n- NEA, SCDF officers have been here a few times already.\n\nThe above issues are facts that can be seen with your own eye on how poorly maintained all these common areas are, and Managing Agent can still lie, saying they are keeping high standards all these years. Just think for yourself, why money spent yearly from owners' monthly maintenance paid but still remained in such poor state.",
