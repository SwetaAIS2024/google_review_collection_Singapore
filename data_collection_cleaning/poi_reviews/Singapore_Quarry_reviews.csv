C,4,"Singapore Quarry is a tranquil nature spot tucked away at the edge of Dairy Farm Nature Park. Once an active granite quarry, it has since been transformed into a peaceful wetland habitat under the care of NParks, now home to freshwater flora and fauna, as well as occasional birdlife. The site reflects Singapore’s broader efforts to repurpose industrial spaces into green recreational areas.

It’s a pleasant and easy 2km walk from Dairy Farm Nature Park Car Park B, with paved trails leading through quiet forested surroundings. The quarry itself features steep rock faces, calm waters, and a sheltered viewing deck — a great place to sit and take in the scenery. I’d rate it a 4 out of 5 — quiet, accessible, and a rewarding slice of nature with a touch of history.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
Forest BK,5,"🦅Singapore Quarry is a disused granite quarry site which had became a tranquil and picturesque freshwater lake thriving with aquatic biodiversity.
🐟The aquatic life in the pond had attracted birds and bird-watchers to it.
🐦The Singapore Quarry is a short walk from the Rail Mall.

⛰️Fun fact:
📍Singapore Quarry was formerly known as Chia Eng Say Quarries.
📍Chia Eng Say, a businessman from Fujian, China, set up several subsidiaries to run the quarry business. Singapore Quarry Co Pte Ltd was the main one running the quarry business.
📍After he passed away, the business was simply referred to as Singapore Quarry.
📍The name became synonymous with the actual quarry site.
📍And Chia Eng Say Quarries became known as Singapore Quarry.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Florence Leow,5,"☘️🌿🌾 Been here many times over the years with friends, nephews and my hubby. It is a lovely park, with calm pond waters & a beautiful scenic quarry landscape.

● You can cut through Jalan Asas as a shortcut path to the Singapore Quarry trail path.

✅️ The Singapore Quarry was mined for many decades and was still in operation till the 1980s. Here, you can spot eagles, kingfishers and monitor lizards at times.

➡️ There are an increasing bunch of macaques' ( monkey) presence. You need to be careful and not feed them, they can be aggressive. 🟢 Do not look at the animals ( monkeys etc) in the eyes for they will perceive it as a challenge.

✳️ Overall, it is a nice park. ✨️🙏🏻 It can be quiet at times, so do go with a companion.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
Adlini Sjah,5,"Beautiful area, gets crowded on weekend mornings with nature photographers and bird watchers. If you are coming from the Rail Corridor there is a shortcut with a sign Singapore Quarry pointing up some steps and a bridge. This bridge leads to a narrow dirtpath which will bring you to the large concrete path to Singapore Quarry. Seems to be a much quicker route than walking from Hillview MRT.

If you liked this view I highly recommend Little Guilin, similar views but more quiet, and less of a walk to get to the quarry",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108619265213206893694/reviews
