Wani Mohan,1,"Had wanton noodles. Firstly, noodles were more than Char siew.  Secondly, char siew were full of fats than meat!! Totally disappointed. Really wonder on their business ethics.  DO NOT RECOMMEND!!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113558214947302973104/reviews

阿宝,3,"Ordered wanton noodle from this stall with high expectation as all past reviews were 5 stars… sadly the noodle is soggy & the sauce used to make the dried noodle was not properly mixed so is a DIY plate of noodle.

The soup, obviously tasted like soup boiled with chicken cube & is salty… & the char siew were hard & stiff… :-(",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
Daniel Ng,5,"Roasted delights inside Loyang Point Family food court lvl 2.

Best stall in the whole food court. Nothing else beats the roasted duck. Best in Singapore and the price is one of the cheapest. Definitely worth the time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101767074423849186719/reviews
LC Choo,1,"Very and I mean very small portion of char siew with rice for $4.50.
