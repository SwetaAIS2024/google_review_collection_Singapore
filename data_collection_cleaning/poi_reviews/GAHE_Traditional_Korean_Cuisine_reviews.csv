J,4,"Ordered the beef set in advance by phone. Upon arrival, queued up and made payment. Waited around 10 minutes for the food to be readyâ€”definitely a shorter wait compared to ordering on the spot. The food was generally good, with tasty side dishes. Great value for money.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104271253474297967471/reviews
Mok Kong Meng,4,"We ordered army soup set and hot bibimbap. I like the hot bibimbap, S$7.90. Affordable meal. It is flavourful and delicious. Outside is raining, it is good to have army soup set. We will come back to try their other dishes.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106005371487342004407/reviews
TAE JIN KIM,5,"Foods are quite closure to the authentic korean food. I tried kimchi soup, soyabean paste soup, and bbq chicken. Kim chi soup and bbq chicken are considered high ranking among rest of food stalls at food courts.
Soyabean paste soup was not bad, but if they add more soyabean paste then it would be much better. If provide optional chill pepper would be even better.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101232828716798929696/reviews
xu shinchan,5,"The korean food is really nice, can beat the restaurants taste. Better than normal korean food at kopitiam koufu or coffeshop. The portion is big, i already ate some portion based on my photos.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101207475728162827647/reviews
LP Pua,5,"We ordered a Chilli Chicken set ($7.70) and a Beef Bulgogi set ($8.90). Both sets included Korean side dishes and a light seaweed soup. The meat portions were generous and flavorful, with the beef being of higher quality than the chicken. Overall, it was an enjoyable and affordable meal.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
