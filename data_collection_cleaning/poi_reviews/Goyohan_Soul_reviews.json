Possibly, due to the busy lunch period, dishes were \"thrown\" to the table abruptly. The restaurant does offer vegetarian choices.",

Wanted to have chilli sauce, indeed as the staff said alittle bit will be very spicy.\n\nUsually don't like to eat pigeon eggs, but then, who knows braised eggs were so addictively nice to eat. So was the ramen soup broth, drank till the last drop. This was more like it, very satisfying üòã",

      "text": "Review based on sharing food among 3 pax.\nOur first time here, and we were pleasantly surprised! The boss and staff were incredibly proactive, attentive, and friendly. They ran out of soy sauce chicken, and when we asked about the spice level for the spicy BBQ chicken, they brought out their kimchi to gauge our spice tolerance.\n\n(1) Egg Fried Rice ($5.90++) üçöüç≥: Well-fried rice with perfectly stirred eggs. Simple but tasty.\n(2) Soondubu Jigae (Pork) ($19++) üç≤üêñ: Comforting sweet-salty soup which I liked. Lots of meat and soft tofu, though the meat was a bit tough. Would return for the no-meat version.\n(3) Spicy BBQ Chicken ($17++) üçóüå∂Ô∏è: Tender and decently flavored with a generous portion.\n(4) Mini Kimchi Pancake ($11.50++) ü•û: Crispy and truly mini.\n(5) Hottocake (On the house)ü•ú: At the end of our meal, the boss offered us these warm and inviting hottocakes with peanut filling. A sweet surprise!\n\nWould order (3) in Pork/Chicken version, and (2) Soondubu Jigae (no meat) on my next visit.",

      "text": "Sub par food, we ordered the spicy pork and kimchi stew. Spicy pork looked and tasted like reheated frozen meat with barely any flavour, even the texture was weird while the kimchi stew was oily and heavy. We asked for the side dishes twice before the staff finally served them to us. Overall, would not recommend coming here if you are an avid korean food lover as the quality is really quite bad. Disappointing experience and I will not be coming back again.",
