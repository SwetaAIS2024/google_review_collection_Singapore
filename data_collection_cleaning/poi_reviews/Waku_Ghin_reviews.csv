P S,5,Contemporary Japanese done right! Chef Corry and team took care of us tonight. The food and service were amazing from start to finish. Balanced flavors that let the ingredients’ tastes shine through. They also wonderfully handled our dietary restrictions. Highly recommended if you’re visiting Singapore!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114140279148034173820/reviews
Leonard,5,"First time visiting this joint for a very special occasion few days back. And it was a great experience!

Food was good, service was impeccable and atmosphere was perfect.  Price point - comparable with restaurants of this nature.

Can't remember exactly the name of each item served - they are all great. These are from their set menu.

We both had a great time! Thanks for the experience!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106120908873002510909/reviews
Karuna Zoey,5,"Second time back at Waku Ghin to celebrate NYE with the family! We were inside the private dining room and had the view of the water show as well. Every dish was delicious, and having the signature dish - Uni with caviar, is the absolute best. It is a must have when you are here in Waku Ghin!

The first time we came, we were at the chef’s table for the sushi menu and it was really one of the best omakase experience. However, we were bummed that the sushi chef has left and Waku Ghin is currently not offering that anymore. :(

Poi Li,4,"It is probably a disadvantage for restaurants in Singapore compared to places which are closer to Japan.  Some fishes are noticeably less  fresh. Otherwise, the restaurant is pretty good overall. Great service and chef skills. There are some noisy customers (think they are regular customers) in the sushi bar. While restaurants are working to provide a nice environment to enjoy food, we customers are the one mess up. What a pity",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118202751478444231666/reviews
Darren Sim,5,"I had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday at Waku Ghin, and it was an unforgettable dining experience. Each dish was meticulously crafted, showcasing the finest ingredients and exceptional culinary artistry. From the delicate chawanmushi with oyster, topped with vibrant green sauce and edible purple flowers, to the impeccably fresh sashimi selection garnished with grated ginger, soy sauce, and wasabi, every bite was a testament to precision and skill. The lobster claws, beautifully presented on ice with a green leaf garnish, were fresh and sweet, while the luxurious uni topped with caviar delivered an explosion of umami flavors.

The freshly grilled abalone, prepared right before me on the teppan grill, was tender and flavorful, and the grilled prawn, paired with aromatic herbs and seaweed, was equally delightful. A standout was the rich abalone dish served in a velvety sauce and crowned with caviar—a true indulgence. To finish, the succulent wagyu beef slices, accompanied by wasabi, garlic chips, and mushrooms, melted in my mouth and left a lasting impression.

After the main courses, we were gracefully moved to a different room for desserts. This transition added a new dimension to the experience, offering a more relaxed and intimate setting to savor the final sweet notes of the evening.

The seamless service and attention to detail elevated the entire experience. Every interaction was warm and professional, and the staff ensured that each course was presented with care and precision. Waku Ghin truly delivers on its reputation for excellence, and I couldn’t have asked for a better way to celebrate. This restaurant is an absolute must for anyone seeking an extraordinary culinary journey.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110664130938344492493/reviews
