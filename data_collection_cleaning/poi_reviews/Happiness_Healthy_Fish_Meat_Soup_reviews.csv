C,4,"Great that Teban Gardens Food Centre has a handful of very decent food stalls and I’d count Happiness Healthy Fish Meat Soup as one of them. The soup is tasty, the serving size is good, and I’d recommend the Fried Fish with Bitter Gourd. Can’t go wrong for anyone after fulfilling local comfort food.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
Sam Wong,5,"Tasted their double fish bitter gourd thin bee hoon at $5. Their soup base is sweet, fish meat also fresh and big portion. No ajinomoto tasted. Overall 8.5/10.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115694236480258826587/reviews
CCS,2,"Long queues every day, all year round means business is good. That explained the curt replies and hurried service.

Being the only fish soup stall in the area also meant there are no reasons to improve. So, nothing has changed in the last five years since I moved into the area.

The plus factors are affordability and consistency.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
Leonard Lim,4,"Unit #01-09. For $8 the Signature soup came with 4-5 thick fish slices, 3 big chunks of deep fried fish, at least 5 clams, slices of soft tender fish maw, bitter gourd. More than fair value for the money.
Would have given higher rating but I prefer the soup stock more robust than the style here.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101173751535810787329/reviews
