Clarissa Poh,5,"Took a few weeks to get an appointment (long line!), but the process itself was smooth and the proceedings at the clinic were efficient. Dr Lynette was very experienced, and my teeth have turned out nice and white and as even as can be hoped for with my fluorosis, with minimal discomfort during and after the Zoom whitening. The staff at the clinic were also friendly and helpful with after care instructions. Thank you for looking after me!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117477473637809224754/reviews
