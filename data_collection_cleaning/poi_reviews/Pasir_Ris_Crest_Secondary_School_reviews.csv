Deelim,5,Good morning Staff. Good morning Crestians. One time I got 9 hours of detention for not bringing a thermometer for temperature taking. Another time I walked in to a fellow student vaping in the toilet. He told me not to tell anyone so i didn't. It was a truly enriching experience which helped me excell in my studies! I hope that more students are able to experience the wonders that this school is able to offer to its students.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116937297546384671601/reviews

mommy milkers,1,"I couldn't put zero stars on a review, so i give PRCSS a one. This school is a SCAM. first of all, the school's resources are limited and most of the school's budget is spent on useless stuff like fixing the water cooler which is useless as it ends up more spoilt than before ðŸ’€ the water was MUSTY when students tried refilling the water. second, the staff in this school is the worst. bad at teaching, as well as not set a good example for the students. ""you're not allowed to use your phones in class"" is a phrase commonly used by teachers everywhere, but yet there are SOME teachers who uses instagram during lesson time ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ and instead of letting students go out for fun learning journies, the school board uses the school budget for themselves and only the fencing cca. the biasness is this school is CRAZY. theres teachers who prefer a specific gender, cca's or even race. this is UNACCEPTABLE. do not come to this school. RUN AWAY WHILE YOU STILL CAN.!!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114063597071946972216/reviews
