Baymax,5,"came there around 8.30am on a saturday. didnt know what to eat as its our first time there. other stores have q and we saw this one with no q and decided to support them. and lemme tell you it was the best decision ever. i had the nasi rawon and each lauk tasted authentic. i really love serunding and i’ve tasted alot of places where the serunding was meh but this one tasted like hari raya. add on terung and even the terung was good too. we tried their nasi lemak and think that the sambal could be better. but overall, we had a filling  breakfast and our stomach was happy!! next time u see no q, don’t auto turn away from the store. give them a chance cause if its good then people are missing out and you can keep coming back wew! (p.s the goreng pisang not from this stall haha)

(update!!)
ate here again after 3years recently and i can sayy tastewise still consistent!! terung was good, lauk petai was good and peria was cooked nicely. 3 of that veggie for a total of $6. Reallyy good deal. Kakak serving was nice too. Will frequent again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100288234154310256655/reviews

Weichiang Tan,5,"Curry chicken's gravy taste excellent! One of the best I have ever tried! The Assam fish also exceeded my personal expectations! Super happy to have come across this store. Owner was very friendly and bubbly too! Most important of all, foods are very decently priced! Definitely must try!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102605134998268244694/reviews
A R Liz,1,There's no wonder why there was no queue at the shop. Rice not hot. Dishes were cold but tasted ok. Bought the nasi ambeng. Kakak in the shop said there's nothing only meat and taught. At least have the decency to add one piece of bagedil. She charged me full price for small pieces of broken meat rendang and taugeh. Should've listened to my friend and not buy from her. All the best to her.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102507402375855230742/reviews
Loki,4,"Food here is good, but their nasi padang price is at least 20% higher than the other stalls in Bedok corner. Especially their nasi lemak - other stalls are selling at $4 but Puteri prices theirs at $5.50.

I once ordered a 2 meat 2 veg nasi padang it added up to $10.80. But food tasted pretty decent so I will still buy from them esp in the morning when the satay solo and nasi kerabu stalls are not open yet.

The only thing I dislike is their tempe goreng, it's fried super hard like a biscuit - even the Ayam penyet stall's tiny square of a tempe tastes so much better.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101937176024039442948/reviews
