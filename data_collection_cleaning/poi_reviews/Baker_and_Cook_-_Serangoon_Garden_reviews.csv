hy hy,2,"Went on a weekday afternoon around 2-3pm and was told their kitchen was closed, could only eat the ready made breads. Tried the mozerella focacia and it was average. the price does not really justify. Got a chai latte, basically tea bag style + milk. Maybe check if their kitchen is open before making your way down as it is quite out of the way.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108731889692251608896/reviews
Fen,5,"Definitely good place for pizza and sourdough bread. First time in this outlet, staff are super friendly.  If you love sourdough too, must try their sourdough pizza. Very generous with ingredients, thin crust, so yummy.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115825972202473277121/reviews
Yun Jia Tan,1,"One of the worst place to dine in.

1. We ordered some pastries and truffle fries. The food was below average. Not worth the price point.

2. We took the seat closest to the kitchen. It was very warm even though the staff claimed the air con is turned on. My family was sweating throughout and that was very unpleasant.

3. Halfway, we realized there was a huge cockroach on the ceiling where we were sitting. Informed one of the staff who asked 'pardon' with a frown. I repeated that there was a cockroach and she simply said OK and turned away.

While I can understand that every fnb establishment, it is normal to have pests. But it's the staff's attitude towards the matter that concerns me. Another staff did acknowledge and said she will inform the manager.

Overall, I cannot find any reason to return to this place. Unimpressive food, price point, service and ambience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101745263566558350104/reviews
randall,4,"Standard baker&cook stuff. Generally nice but a little bit pricy all things considered. Usually come by here cause it's quieter and a great place to just chill. Wait for people, read a book, use your laptop. Perfect spot.
Plank which serves pizza is in the same place and they're pizzas are pretty decent too.  But I just had coffee today",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109975281303071622618/reviews
Henry Goh,5,"Came here with friends after a church event and ordered the pizza #7 and another pizza which had figs, tomato salad, B&C trio dips and a multi grain croissant. We had the Cappuccino and Apple Tangs for drinks.
The pizza did not disappoint with its fresh taste of dough, tomato sauce base and chewy cheese covered with well cooked mushroom slices. The other pizza was a refreshingly sweet than savory.
Enjoyed the great Cappuccino made with care and the apple tangs were thirst quenching esp inches hot weather.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100433835635881270730/reviews
