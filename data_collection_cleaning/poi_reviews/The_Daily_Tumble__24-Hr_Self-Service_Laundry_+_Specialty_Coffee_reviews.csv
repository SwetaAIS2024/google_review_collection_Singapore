Kenny Tan,5,"Visited on a weekday night and the token-enabled machines were available. Did not have to wait for a machine.

Parking spots were available in front of the laundromat but they were all taken up by multiple lorries and cars. We were somehow compelled to park at the rear of the row of shophouses, risking a parking fine and were even told off by one of the business owners along that row who claimed the road at the back belong to him and his company.

Stepping into the laundromat, one notices first thing the lighting, bright colours and the nice woodwork. We were very glad we found Dutch Colony coffee being served from a very expensive and branded coffee machine! The cappuccino was fragrant and the pricing seemed reasonable. Payment was cashless, making it very convenient. The condiments were DIY, had to spin them to dispense and were very cute actually.

We were also fortunate to meet the owners who were a friendly duo who shared the concept behind TDT. They even obliged us for a photo! Kudos to the team and we wish you all success! üíØü´ß

PS: Would air-conditioning your place be an option you would consider as a comfortable amenity? Would be perfecto!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108824741250374312282/reviews
Tan Bee Lan,5,"THE DAILY TUMBLER

It my first time doing laundry here . I actually can park the car just right in front of the shop but there was no lot available.

I joined the membership for a month and it‚Äôs only $50 , I am given a code for unlimited loads used in a month; it‚Äôs incredible rightüòç

I love this place as it‚Äôs so cool, clean and bright.
The experience was good as the owner James, a warm and friendly man came to give me an orientation on the total digital system of the laundry setup.

During the waiting time of washing and drying, I actually enjoyed the cold drinks and breeze under the ceiling fan üòò with the nice music in the air‚Ä¶.

When times up , I cleared my laundry and went home with a real satisfied smile üòä‚Ä¶
Try to come agin next week ‚Ä¶

I definitely will recommend this laundromat to my friends and family üòÑ",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116576705131180623301/reviews
Capture Asia Photography,5,"This venue is a well-designed and customer-friendly spot in the neighborhood. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eyes of customers. The combination of aesthetic appeal, reasonably priced refreshments, convenient phone charging and play of music, such services definitely makes it stand out.

If the interior is warm, there‚Äôs a switch inside to turn on the fans.

If you forget coins is all right. Can pay via Mastercard, Visa, ApplePay and Google Pay. üòÆ",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113796572659279486041/reviews
Amine Alouini,5,"I used this service while a small trip in Singapore.
This is super useful, if you need to wash your clothes by yourself instead of using the hotel services.
(Prices in Nov 2024)
The washing starts from 7 S$ for special care or 8 S$ for 14 kg washing.
The drying atarts from 6 S$.
Prices seem to be reasonable and fair for this area.

What I liked Breeze station where you can charge your phone in case you are out of battery.

Also, for coffee lovers it's possible to grab a coffee from the coffee machine (Pricing starts from 3.8 S$.

Payment is possible in card or in cash.
For coffee the payment is only in card.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110558863081681111512/reviews
Stan Kosy,5,"Very clean and well setup. We had a small issue with the paywave payment, but the team was very responsive and supportive to get the laundry started. Very nice service and pleasant experience overall. They even gave some board games and coffee while you‚Äôre waiting for your laundry.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105482005234289823777/reviews
