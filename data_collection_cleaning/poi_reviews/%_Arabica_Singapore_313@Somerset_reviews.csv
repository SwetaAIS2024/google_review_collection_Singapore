Ivan Michael Pung,5,"Located along the long 🛣️ walking 🚶‍♀️🚶🚶‍♂️stretch of 313 Somerset 🏬, it’s almost in a perfect location to catch a coffee ☕️ break from all the shopping 🛍️. It was a lazy afternoon and it took me a 2️⃣ passes before I decided to queue for it, cause there is always a queue! (And a long one)

Café : You start queuing from the right ➡️ hand side, past the roasting  🫘room and eventually reach the cashier 👨‍💻 to place your order. There are limited pastries 🥧🍰🥐on sale and the primary focus is on their coffee ☕️ which uses 💯 Arabica Beans.

The café itself has an outdoor seating 🪑area that fuses to the side 🏘️ walk of 313 Somerset and it is clean 🫧🧼, spacious and brightly 🌟 designed to allow lots of natural ☀️ light in. It bears an interesting design concept whereby the dining areas are cross facing, stool, bar, table, cozy corners all rolled into one. (You gotta check out my pics 📸 and videos 🎥!) It created a non-consistent functional design that doesn’t force the diners to face only in one direction. Sort of like control chaos, Love 🥰 It, it’s so cool! 😎

Staff : One single staff 💁‍♂️member took my order 📝. Pretty straight forward ….. Coffee ☕️ + Size and pay 💳. He was friendly but didn’t recommend me anything else.

Coffee : I ordered a Café Latte and it was a wicked cup 😃! If I’m not mistaken, they are using a Slayer coffee machine and it pulled a great 👍 shot of espresso! Its coffee ☕️was not overly hot 🌡️, aromatic and super rich. If I could get a table and have more space, I would have tried the pastry and an Americano. Oh well, next time then, I would really love ❤️ to sit down and soak it in.

Zi Xuan Lee,5,"% Arabica Singapore: Earth Day celebrations with free Oatside upgrade till 15 May!

Coffee lovers, if you haven't yet visited % Arabica, it's time you did. With 8 outlets across Singapore, this famous Kyoto-born brand brings world-class brews paired with their signature clean, minimalist aesthetic — a perfect zen retreat for any coffee break.

They are having an Earth Day promotion: a complimentary Oatside oat milk upgrade for any beverage from 17 April to 15 May! A small but meaningful step to celebrate our planet with every cup.

Caffe Latte (Hot) - Single Origin ($7.40 for 8oz, $8.40 for 12oz)
Made with rotating beans from Ethiopia, Brazil, Nicaragua, or Costa Rica, the latte was smooth and full-bodied with fragrant toasty notes. It had a creamy mouthfeel, sweet milky flavour and a pleasant bittersweet finish that lingered gently. It glided down like a dream, warm and comforting, perfect for a relaxing afternoon.

Dark Latte (Hot) - % Arabica Blend with Oatside Oat Milk ($8.90 for 8oz, $9.90 for 12oz)
This was love at first sip. The bold roasted coffee mingled beautifully with deep, rich dark chocolate notes, capped by the smooth, creamy oat milk. The drink had a strong earthy aroma, balanced sweetness, and a mild bitter hint — almost resembling a mocha, but with more depth and elegance. Robust, smooth, and deeply satisfying, it's a must-try if you love a rich, chocolatey profile without overwhelming acidity.

At % Arabica, you get to choose between their proprietary espresso blend (Brazilian and European beans) or their Single Origin beans — all roasted to a medium to medium-dark roast that strikes a sweet spot between boldness and smoothness. Every cup is brewed with precision, staying true to their philosophy of simplicity, quality, and authenticity.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108657541934577016131/reviews
Ramon “Jae” Bespinyowong,5,"Got a latte with soy here. The beans are nicely roasted and have chocolatey notes. Giving it 4/5 as I hope they will let us choose the beans, as I prefer fruity notes over nutty ones.

The staff were very nice and patiently explained what Kyoto latte and Spanish latte are.

The ambience is nice and clean.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101181744493032562339/reviews
Doraemon,5,"Kitty and I were meeting our friends at 313 Somerset for a birthday celebration, but we arrived a little early. We decided to grab some coffee at % Arabica, which we'd been wanting to try for a while.  We've always loved the aroma of coffee wafting from the shop, and we were finally able to try their brews.

Kitty wanted something a little sweeter, so the barista recommended the Spanish Latte.  We both ordered one, and at $9.60 per cup, it came out to $19.20 for both.  Kitty absolutely loved it!  She said it was full of aroma and the sweetness was just right for her.

The coffee is delicious, and the atmosphere is fantastic. It's cozy and inviting, with a touch of futuristic decor.  It was a great place to relax and chat while we waited for our friends.

The coffee was truly amazing!  It was more flavorful than any other coffee we've had in Singapore, and the aroma was just incredible.  The coffee blew us away!  It was definitely worth the price.

We highly recommend % Arabica to anyone who loves coffee! You won't regret it.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112665277904119154671/reviews
