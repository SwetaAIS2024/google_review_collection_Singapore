      "text": "Weekend Wanders: Jurong Central Park\nTook a stroll through Jurong Central Park over the weekend — a peaceful green escape nestled just minutes away from Jurong Point and Boon Lay MRT.\n\nThough it’s not as expansive as Jurong Lake Gardens, the park offers a refreshing and lush environment that’s perfect for unwinding after a hearty lunch or shopping spree at the mall. With its open lawns, shaded walking paths, and the gentle rustling of trees, it’s a wonderful spot to just pause and breathe.\n\nIf you’re around Jurong and need a short nature break, this park is definitely worth a visit. Sometimes, it’s the smaller green spaces that offer the biggest reset.",
