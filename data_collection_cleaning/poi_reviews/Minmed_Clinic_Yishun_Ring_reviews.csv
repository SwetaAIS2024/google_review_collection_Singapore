Mariayanti,1,"I had a very disappointing experience at this clinic. The doctor showed a lack of professionalism and engagement throughout the consultation. My child was clearly unwell, but instead of interacting with him and thoroughly assessing the situation, I felt like I had to guide the entire process. It was as though I was doing his job for him, which is unacceptable.

The consultation felt rushed and impersonal, as if every patient is treated the same regardless of their unique needs. To make matters worse, the clinic didn’t have the necessary medications in stock, so I had to go to a pharmacy afterward, making the whole visit feel like a waste of time and money.

I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone looking for attentive and professional care. It’s clear that this clinic prioritizes quantity over quality, and I’ll be avoiding it in the future.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117927953857745369678/reviews
renbin you,1,I arrived 20 minutes early but the door was not open. It finally opened at almost 2:00. I waited at the door for another 5 minutes. I thought they were still preparing. I went in after 5 minutes and asked. The staff looked confused and told me that there was no doctor today.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111145580237907775154/reviews
Maia Sulaiman,2,"Generally this outlet has good service, good doctor & good medications that works. However, there were a few occasions whereby the clinic is open with a staff behind the counter but they claimed clinic is close as there are no doctors around. Such a bummer when Google shows that the clinic is supposed to be open & when we need to see doctor due to feeling unwell.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112945245011761605339/reviews
