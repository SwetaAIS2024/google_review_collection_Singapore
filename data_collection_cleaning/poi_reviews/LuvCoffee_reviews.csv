Freshly made waffle with fruits was a hit.
Best part they have fresh coconut juice too.

Adrian Koh,1,Look at the amount of filling inside a pain au chocolat. Its a toally scam. No buttery taste and coffee is defintely a robusta beans. Its the worst coffee you even find in east coast parkway,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112406855299738923618/reviews
