Great variety for topping: fried egg, fried beancurd, braised bean stick, fried squid paste, otah, chicken wings, Taiwan sausage, ngoh hiang, cabbage, 3 types of fish cakes, western sausage, spring roll, hash brown, sea weed chicken. Chilli taste great and not too spicy. Staff are very friendly and work very fast. One of the popular stalls in this coffee shop. Price is wallet friendly.",

Also enjoyed the fishcake, and  the chilli was really good.\n\nOthers seem to like it too - saw someone order multiple packets for over $50.",
