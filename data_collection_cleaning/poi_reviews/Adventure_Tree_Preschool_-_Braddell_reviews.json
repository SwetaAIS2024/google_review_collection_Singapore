      "text": "been here since my son was an infant and he’s in PG now. teachers are engaging, ambience is cosy, and environment in the neighbourhood is nice. i love that outdoor water play and walks to the park/playground opposite the school are part of their regular programming, and the class sizes are small which means every child is engaged thoroughly. the children here are sweet and friendly too, which reflects a holistic education the staff provides (ie not just language and math but also manners and social skills). thank you Ms Morgane, Ms Karen and all the infant & PG teachers.",
