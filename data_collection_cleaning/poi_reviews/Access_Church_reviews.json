So I decided to check it out in person… and wow, I’m so glad I did.\nFrom the moment I walked in, it just felt so warm and homely. Everyone was super friendly and genuine, like you’re part of the family from day one.\nThe sermon was amazing—so real, so relevant, and it really spoke to me. If you’re looking for a place that’s full of heart and truth, this is it.",

Never felt as drawn to a place like this one - though small, the presence of God can be felt on a corporate and interpersonal level.\n\nPastors are spiritually and socially adept; unfazed by accounts of church hurt, difficult conversations and real struggles; holding space for true versions of selves while equipping and pointing the flock towards God. No spiritual arrogance or overly distorted views of life here — just people intrinsically motivated to pursue Jesus.\n\nExcited for what’s ahead!",

I walked in ~3 years ago hesitant, cautious & mildly unsure of the mix of youngsters running what I’d initially felt was an off brand worship church. Today, I call this church my home. God has profoundly blessed and multiplied this church in so many ways. I’d recommend this church if you’re looking for a loving, fun and welcoming community you can’t get rid of, because you’ll spend eternity with them.",

No matter how broken you are or how messed up ur past is, im sure you will fit into this community cos its full of imperfect people like me and you. Spirit-filled too, what more to ask for",
