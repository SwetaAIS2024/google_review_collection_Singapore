Nurul Fatin,5,"Amazing flavors in every dish! The Seafood Tom Yum was rich and aromatic, the Ikan 3 Rasa perfectly crispy with sweet, spicy, and tangy sauces, and the Daging Merah was tender and flavorful. Loved the creamy Buttermilk Chicken and crispy Fried Egg too! A must-visit for a satisfying, hearty meal. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113486542328682430040/reviews
Hafiy Mohamad,5,"My favourite stall ever since first ate there last month. Been patronising 2times a week at least.

Price: Reasonable

Food choices/ varieties: Spoilt for choices! (Ate there for breakfast and lunch on a same day once). Need to come back few times to try out other main dishes and kuih-muihs

Quantity: Generous

Staffs/ Service: Very motherly and kind. Speedy service with the abang in kitchen and 2 kakak at stall front. Take note of the separate Q line for ordering.

Pros: Best place for the elusive Nasi Rawon (it's hard to find tasty Rawon in North area). Even just a plain rice, paru, bagedil and Rawon gravy may cost approx $7+, the serving is generous. Place is also very lively and ""kampung spirited"".

Cons: Peak hour around 7.30am-9am. May be hard to get a seat, although the patrons there are all very friendly and will offer a seat to join at their table.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116572905620528372476/reviews
Benjamin Lim,1,6 dollars for two dishes. A little bit of cuttlefish and meat. While other customers order 2 same meat and 1 veg is 6 dollars. I am probably someone very special to get such pricing,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107527289324414177490/reviews
