Teck Yeow Chua,5,"I like their robotics and coding courses using Korean patented MODI modules. They make it very easy for young children to learn coding and robotics in a fun way. Unconsciously, children pick up creative thinking skills. A good foundation for children to grow in STEAM knowledge.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112231345245006431040/reviews
Linus Lee Kai Wei,5,"Heard a lot about PlayFACTO student care centre and the curriculum it offers which includes creative maths and robotics.
The centre is pleasantly designed and provides a pleasant environment for the children. Playfacto also provides a wide variety of meals that is sourced from a central kitchen which is nutritious and tasty. Looking forward to your grand opening in Aljunied!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109990739046819930022/reviews
Yu Wei Sarah Lee,5,"When we step in, we could see that the place is newly renovated, bright, airy, gives a cosy vibe & conducive for learning. This helps break away from the school setting that our son is accustomed to in the morning. With a change in setting, the environment mentally engages his mind and relaxes him, which is a good alternative to home.

We like that there is a structured curriculum in place where the teachers provide guidance on his homework and drill him on spellings. There is also focus on each subject a day where worksheets are provided to deepen their understanding. Not to mention, Fridays where he is empowered to do things that interests him like art & craft or just unwinding for the weekend. On top of this, there is paid for enrichment classes conveniently provided under the same roof. This include robotics and maths that we do not need to locate elsewhere. Our son likes the reading corner and enjoys engaging in puzzles with his peers such as Jig saw, Tangram, Pentomino, Sudoko & others. This center goes beyond the basic looking after your child (e.g. relief teacher) but enriches him academically, socially and holistically as it bridges general knowledge of what is happening around us through holiday programs. It does not disconnect him from the world we live in but provide insights and practical activities that could be as simple as folding plastic bags! With the strong program and purpose that it brings, it makes it easier for us to give our son a more balanced childhood as school related work is mainly settled during weekdays while weekends are reserved for sports, leisure & family time.

With our son onboard this month and multiple communications over prior months, we
could witness that Patricia and her teachers are dedicated and passionate with their callings. They will provide us with timely updates on his progress and practical tips on areas that he can work on. Whenever we have a concern on his learning, they are open to listen and flexible to cater to our needs, where possible. This includes emphasis on mandarin, return transport home and transport from school after CCA & extra classes. With an open communication and timely feedback from the school, it assures us as parents that our son is in good hands.

We are happy that we made a right decision to choose Playfacto Aljunied & this is definitely unparalleled elsewhere!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112488283721365901209/reviews
