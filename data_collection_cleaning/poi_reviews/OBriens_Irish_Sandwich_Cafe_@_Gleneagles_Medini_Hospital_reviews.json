      "text": "Very disappointed with the Oâ€™Briens outlet at Gleneagles Medini. According to Google, they close at 7:00 PM â€” yet for two days in a row, they were already refusing customers well before that. On May 6th, I arrived at 6:30 PM and was told they were done for the day, with everything packed up. Today, May 7th, I came even earlier at 5:45 PM, only to find the staff already stopped taking order and the staff start cleaning up.\n\nIf your closing time is 7:00 PM, why are you shutting down over an hour early? Either update your official hours on google and your website or train your staff properly. This kind of laziness and disregard for customers is unacceptable. I hope the management takes this seriously â€” clearly, the staff are not doing their jobs.",

Honestly, I have ordered for 2nd wrap chicken for my spouse and mother in law. They prepared the sandwiches freshly and we can visually check on their foods. I do like this style of food preparation because transparency.The environment in this shop not noisy because they are inside the hospital.",
