The thoughtful two-faced TV design added to the convenience.\n\nHowever, the centralized air conditioning was a bit overpowering, and ordering snacks in the room resulted in a rather strong smell.\n\nNonetheless, the overall experience was satisfactory.",

Overall good experience if you mind forking out the sum of money. It was a special event and we were singing until 1.30am. The sofas were comfortable and sufficient to sit many people, plus the movable stools. Staff were responsive and the food served was quite good.\nFor those looking to play darts, you have to choose the Bugis outlet.",

      "text": "terrible first experience here. context : my friends and i ( total of 4 pax ) sang for only a total of 2.5 hours despite saying that we would get 3 hours for the price of 2. The machine and light switches malfunctioned at the 1.5 mark and after it was fixed one of the staff said they would REFUND us 30 minutes of cost. However at the end of our session, they kept changing their words and saying that we heard wrongly instead of 30 mins of cost they would add on 30 more extra mins for the session. None of them admitted it was our faults and kept pushing the blame towards us. when we pointed our which staff who said so, he kept silent .moreover so, the machine stated our session was over by 40 mins?? before the session duration. Payment is done midway through the session??? which made it so disruptive. total bill had gst and service charge included which was a little unreasonable considering we never ordered anything or nothing was being served to us. hence, very irresponsible staff here. Not worth your trip. ( suntec outlet )",

The staff made us pay DURING the singing time (not before or after) The machines are broken, limits songs available. The singing time was started 10minutes after the reservation but was ended at original time 1hr after reservation.\n\nThere's a better option nearby for cheaper and greater availability.",
