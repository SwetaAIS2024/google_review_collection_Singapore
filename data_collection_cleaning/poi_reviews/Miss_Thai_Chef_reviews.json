We ordered delivery to our home as the restaurant is far away from us.\n\nLoved everything we tasted! They exceeded our expectations and were full of flavours without being overly salty. The texture of dynameat elevated the dining experience.",

Their basil with rice is a definite must-try! Even their stir-fries hit the spot and our kids love their Pad Thai so much that they asked for second helping. Every dish is well spiced and bursting with flavours, seriously delicious!\n\nAll dishes under the vegetarian menu can be veganised and made alliums free!\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Follow my IG @eatsimply02 for more veggies finds.üå±",

Which for me it is worth it as the food is nice.",
