      "text": "Taan Asian Grill Bar is a lively and inviting eatery in Singapore, offering a unique fusion of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and local cuisines. Their menu features an impressive array of over 50 charcoal-grilled skewers, complemented by a fun selection of frozen beers. The ambiance is cozy, and the staff are attentive and friendly. A quirky touch: if you order beer in larger quantities, you'll be given mahjong chips to use for redeeming your drinks ‚Äî a playful twist that adds to the experience.",

So flavoursome and the place is more of a bar so very relaxed - just what we like. Returned during our trip as nothing else came close. We had the skewers this time which were nice but nothing special so the stir fry menu is the way to go!",
