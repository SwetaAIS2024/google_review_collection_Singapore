      "text": "üü©CIN CIN - Gin Bar @  Tanjong Pagar\n‚ùáÔ∏è Oasia Hotel Downtown\n100 Peck Seah Street #01-02,\nSingapore 079333\n\nüîµ Cin Cin is a stylish 75-seater gin bar located in the heart of Oasia Hotel Downtown on the first level. üü¶ As I stepped inside, I was surrounded by a sophisticated and soothing ambience that is perfect for a relaxing evening.\n\n‚óè I scanned through their drinks' menu quickly, and found that their extensive collection features boutique gins from around the world, craft gin cocktails, and gin-inspired drinks.\n\nüü´ I was informed that Cin Cin is primarily a gin bar, and their operating hours are from 3 pm to 11 pm, Tues to Sat. ‚û°Ô∏è They're closed on Mondays and Sundays. üü• They have Happy Hours from opening time till 8PM.\n\nüî∂Ô∏è I ordered the fresh Orange Juice at SGD6+ a glass.\n\nüü¶ Service wise = The bar tender, Marco, is a really nice guy. The moment I stepped in, I was greeted by Marco with a wide smile and he ushered me to my seat and offered to dry my folded umbrella ( as it was raining outside). He had a very genuine disposition and was polite, friendly, cheerful and affable.\n\nüü© It is staff like Marco that makes a place pleasant and interesting. He is an asset to the Cin Cin Bar Lounge. I hope to be back here again with my hubby some day.\n\nFlorence, dated 3rd April 2025 Thurs / 5.45 pm",

They serve great bar snacks. Was told the snacks come from Marmalade Pantry. One of the better truffles fries I had. Buffalo wings was great too. Cozy ambience and excellent service.",

During my most recent visit, we ended up trying quite a few drinks. My favourites were the Kopi Kaki, Bloody Berry, Golden Fox Negroni and the Foxy Badger. The Kopi Kaki drink is a must try in my view.\n\nService is quite good here.\n\nCin Cin is definitely one of the best gin cocktail bars in SG, and if gin cocktails are your thing, this place is a must visit.",
