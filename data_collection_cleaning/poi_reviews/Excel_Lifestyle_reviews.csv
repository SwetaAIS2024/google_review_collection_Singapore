Melvin Yo,5,"We had a family gathering here and the place was excellent for hosting large groups (ours was 60 pax).

The host was accommodating and you can set up a stage for live music, Karaoke or other entertainment.

Our food was served buffet style and yiu can also arrange for drinks service , including draft beer. The server will help tally the drinks ordered.

Highly recommended.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104893903998139722748/reviews
Joe Lim,5,"I had the pleasure of hosting my company’s CNY dinner at Excel Lifestyle, and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience! Located conveniently beside Seletar Airport, this hidden gem offers a perfect mix of excellent food, great service, and a lively atmosphere.

The food was absolutely top-notch. Each dish was prepared with care and flavor, making it clear that they truly prioritize quality. The staff were attentive and friendly, making sure everything went smoothly throughout the evening. A special mention goes to the Lohei – they made it a memorable experience, helping us with the traditional tossing while offering a great selection of drinks from their impressive wall of whiskey.

To top it all off, they provided karaoke during the festive period, which added a fun and lively touch to the celebration. Whether you're looking for a place to dine with family, friends, or colleagues, Excel Lifestyle has something for everyone.

Highly recommend this fantastic spot for both good food and a great time, especially if you're in the Seletar Aerospace area. Affordable, excellent service, and an overall fun environment – this place checks all the boxes!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106028086009920912832/reviews

Shamala Naidu,5,"We had a wonderful dining experience last night, thanks to the outstanding service provided by the entire team, especially Ms. May, the supervisor. She went above and beyond to accommodate our requests, ensuring that we were comfortable and well taken care of throughout our meal.
Ms. May's attentiveness was truly commendable, she frequently checked in to see if our food was satisfactory and if we needed anything else. When we found the hor fun to be a little saltless, she promptly brought us sauces with a warm smile and even offered to have a new plate prepared for us. Such dedication to customer satisfaction is rare and greatly appreciated.
Not only that, the Western food chef was incredibly accommodating, serving us with a cheerful demeanor. In fact, all the staff members were welcoming and exuded a sense of genuine hospitality, which made the experience even more enjoyable.
The ambience of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, with clean washrooms adding to the overall comfort of the space. I sincerely thank Ms. May and her team for their excellent service, and I look forward to dining here again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113042398642872664972/reviews
