Like any other outlets, Changi Village Hokkien Mee is quite nice as always, even Jurong West!\n\nOne of the best options for me to eat Hokkien Mee especially at Jurong West! I also like the service as well, fast within 5-8 minutes despite dinner time.",

The little pieces of pork lard were quite good, thankfully. Chilli is more meant for Nasi Lemak than HCM. Not worth the calories. I did not manage to see through the plate.",
