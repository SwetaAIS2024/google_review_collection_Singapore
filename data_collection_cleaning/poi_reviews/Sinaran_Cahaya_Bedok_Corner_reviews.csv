Sam K,5,Must have been the best curry puff I had in Singapore. The potato curry puff is the best and feel like home made stuff. Right amount of curry flavor and spice level.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100680635125732126785/reviews
Roland,4,"A must visit stall whenever I’m at this hawker centre, I have visited this place since my National Service days in the 90s, even before it was renovated.

The traditional curry puff is just so simply nice, be it the potato or sardines version. The filling is so full and freshly made daily in the stall and deep fried on the spot.

Not many of these stall around, so do support and try if you’re at this hawker centre.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103766504321573171977/reviews
