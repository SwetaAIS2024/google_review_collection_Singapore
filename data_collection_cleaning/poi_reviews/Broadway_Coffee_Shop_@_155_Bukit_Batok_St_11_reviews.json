      "text": "Nearly every stall is a gem. Most of the stalls here are famous for their own food. For instance, the bbq n roast pork rice, Tiong Bahru lor mee, Local traditional kuehs (desserts) such as Ang Ku Kueh, Fried Glutinuous Rice, Yam Cake, Pink Rice Cake in the shape of a kidney and Soon Kueh. Its Ang Ku Kueh is so sellable that stallholder advised me to go by 7am as it will be sold out by then. I highly recommend its Lor Noodle; same taste as its flagship stall used to be at Tiong Bahru wet market. Home-grown locals like me enhance the lor mee taste with chinese black vinegar and grounded garlic. Emm ... yum yum!",

Tried the Tie Guan Yin Fresh Milk Tea with Brown Sugar (less sugar) and it was actually not bad, not too sweet too. Often come here for the very affordable wanton mee and the western food stall. Love the great variety of food they offer! Due to the current covid situation, they are abiding strictly to the safe distancing rule, hence, for the time being there might be limited seatings.",

My 11yo daughter took the items and pass to the stall person. When I handed the $10 note and she told me $4.90. I thought I see wrongly the noodle need another 70 cents.\n\nI immediately double checked with my girl on the spot what she took. We counted as 5. I told the lady again she said my girl took 1 more cabbage. After she recount again right in front of me she said she see wrongly.\n\nHow many would really go see the change. After that my girl told me the uncle after her also was charged 4.90 and he told the stall and she return back 70cents.\n\nVery dishonest and I will definitely not patronise this stall anymore.",
