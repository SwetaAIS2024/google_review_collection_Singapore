Enigma,5,"A connector between Chinatown, One Raffles and MBS for those rainy and hot days. There's niche coffee cafes for ""on the go"" coffees and a Cedele too.

Vincent Lee,4,"This mall is under the Marina Bay Financial Center and because the shops serve primarily the office population, it is quite a breathe of fresh air during the weekend - none of the typical crowd like at other malls in the country as most of the retail and eateries are closed.

Connected by Downtown MRT and Raffles Place MRT (a further walk), this might be a great place to come for a meal or coffee. Starbuck and Din Tai Fung are open when I was there Saturday.

The mall is also a great space if you want to change up your jogging/walking route with immediate access to the beautiful Marina bay front and Gardens by the Bay.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111417065994620089449/reviews
