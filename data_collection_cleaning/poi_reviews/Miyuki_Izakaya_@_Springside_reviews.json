(Didnâ€™t manage to get service staff name, but she is so helpful and even reach out to help us snap a photo)\n\nThe food was so deliciousâ€”each dish was full of flavor and cooked to perfection. The atmosphere was just as impressive; it had the perfect balance of cozy and lively, making it the ideal spot for a relaxing meal.\nThank you Team Miyuki Izakaya!! ðŸ«¡",

      "text": "Was brought to this Izakaya in a quite out of the way area. Service was abit lackadaisical and food wise was alright but nothing to shout out about.\n\nTheir speciality seems to be the yakitori and I tried their Wagyu beef skewer priced at $16+ for 2 skewers of beef. Was below expectations as Wagyu beef skewers go...not the least not char on the greyish looking meat which failed my visual test taste wise was average.\n\nSashimi and temaki was slightly better but price wise lost out to Sushi Zanmai.\n\nOverall was ok but won't be worth the trip to eat again as it's quite expensive for average food.",

      "text": "Came for dinner and I find the place rather cosy. Wasn't too many people on a weekday dinner. Ordered a few light dishes and all of them were great! My absolute favourite that night has got to be the monkfish liver. Very soft and tender; I'd never know it's a fish's liver I'm eating. No fishy taste or smell at all. The grilled items were delicious (I was looking for leek but they don't seem to have it ... I thought it's a very normal grill item in a Japanese restaurant). Can try the tsukune with onsen egg. The beef exceed my expectations too. Would definitely come back to try more.",
