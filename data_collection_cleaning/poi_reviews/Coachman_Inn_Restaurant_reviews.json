Every dish was spot onâ€¦ ok, maybe curry fishhead can be a tad saltier.\nIt was midday and really hot. Luckily restaurant has many standing fans to blow away the heat. Pretty breezy I would say.\nBest to call ahead for reservations. Almost full house today.",

We ordered a portion of the set, short of an appetizer, main, desserts and still had a filling meal since we ordered their fishhead curry which is highly recommended.    The final bill was reasonable and with a great seaview and sea breeze, it's worthy of 5 stars.",

The fish head curry is a must try. Do make a reservation before you head out here. This restaurant is very popular especially during weekends.",

Food came quickly and they were all really good!\n\nWe had the crispy lotus roots, dry fried kway teow, Kang kong belachan and grilled squid with their house mixed cincalok sauce. Portions were generous too, these 4 dishes could have fed 3, but since it was just us 2, we happily overate.\n\nProps to the team esp Dayes, for a wonderful meal with a view of the sea :)",
