Ryan,5,"You all shld join this school but got 1 or 2  teachers that r toooooooooo strict and racist(not gonna mention names) for example, got one math teacher racist to me and my other Malay and Indian friends. We keep getting targetted by her but towards the Chinese, she very good. Rarely scold them. She also like to take sides. If u ever encounter my teacher, just know u need to study extra harder. Her teaching just not teachinging. But other than that, it's a VERY good school. I recommend all parents to enrol their kid here.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110362312073348990992/reviews

Kaixin Pandaa,5,"Im graduating this year and I would say that I have learned a lot in Northland and also I am always proud to be a Northlander.
Also credits to my teachers teaching us so hard especially this year 2020 with covid , the teachers still helped us whatever they can .
Now after PSLE , im already excited for the time really enjoying the Northland area the last few times without stress.
So if any parents want to send their kid to this school and is wondering if you should? My answer is YES.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114105476351313075767/reviews
