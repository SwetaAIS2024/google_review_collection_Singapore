      "text": "Horrible customer service, we went into the store on 14 September 22:49 and we chose our ice cream within seconds. However the cashier ( a very rude girl) depleasing informed us that she is doing settlement so we have to wait for her to count finish before she can help us do payment. We told her okay and we was standing there for a good 5-7 minutes and she rudely told us to come over here. After that she proceeded to to ask us if we want to pay by cash or card as she can only accept cash because she do settlement already??? I don't understand the shop stated that it closes at 11 so I have the right to purchase and if cannot accept card why not tell us first instead of making us stand there like idiots watching her count money. I really don't understand why you guys hire such people to attend to your store. Very disappointed kap resident who always visited the mart below.",
