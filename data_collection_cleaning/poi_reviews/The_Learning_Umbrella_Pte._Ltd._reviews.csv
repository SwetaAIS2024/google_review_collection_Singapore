Nirmala V S,5,"We cannot thank Aditi (Learning Umbrella) enough for helping us with our purchase of Resound hearing aids. We had so many doubts and a bit of resistance for hearing aids, but she patiently heard and counseled us at every step, she was extremely accommodating and let us take our time to test and decide. She also followed up with us after we bought the product from her. Her clinic is well equipped and centrally located. We would definitely recommend to consult her.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105875661553673345251/reviews
