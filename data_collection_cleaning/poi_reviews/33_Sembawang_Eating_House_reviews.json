Ya maybe the flavour isn't the best but come on look at that seafood fried rice with omelette and tell me that ain't good. Plus piping hot fish soup after drinks? That's dope all around. We ordered the steamed egg with century egg which was mid but still satisfying. Would definitely visit again if I was in the area with a hankering for supper.",

Reasonable pricing and yummy dishes accompanying the porridge!\nSweet and sour pork was good and not fatty, hae bee hiam yummy, the braised sauce was üëçüëç. What stole the show was the sambal sotong, we had 2 at $6 each and it was cooked so perfectly and sambal sauce was great too! Do note that it opens very early in the morning and closes around 3pm. Will patronise again for sure. üòÉ",

One cook single handedly whipped up 20+ dishes and many fresh steam fishes.\n\nI noted that they were recently opened in May 2023. There was a stall in the past that seemed to have a bad reputation. They should have used a new brand name",
