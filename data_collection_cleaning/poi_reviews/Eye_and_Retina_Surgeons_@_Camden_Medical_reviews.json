      "text": "Too many staff hovering at counters. They chat to one another, making the small reception area more noisy and crowded than necessary. I also find the staff rude, they barge in the clinic when the doctor is giving a diagnosis. I find this young man (think he had a ear-ring) arrogant and constantly interupted Dr Chee Soon Phaik while she was with the patient. He barges into the clinic, and stands and talks while she is checking or speaking to her patients. Considering the amount this clinic charges, I expect better service and uninterrupted time with the doctor. If this continues, noisy rude staff will ruin the clinic's reputation.",

      "text": "My daughter had eye swelling last month and her usual brilliant eye specialist was away on holiday. Dr Su was informed to be her replacement. My daughter went to see Dr Su who cursorily gave her a short consultation, dispensed an eye cleanser she was already using and charged a large fee. She is a teenager. A few days later, she was still not better and she waited till her usual doctor was back to consult her. My daughter’s eye was fine after her usual doctor prescribed eye drops. The insurance now asked for a memo for us to claim and Dr Su is asking for $50! Horrors. I think I will report him to the MOH. He did not remedy my daughter’s situation but asked for more money.",

They are also clearly the best in their field and their advice is well thought out, considered and experienced. All in all, it is always an extremely pleasant and relaxing experience, which is rare to me personally especially when clinics/hospitals always feel very cold, intimidating and unpersonal. Going for medical check-ups are already scary enough! Would highly recommend.",
