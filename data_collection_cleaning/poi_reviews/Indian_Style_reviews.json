Food tasted awesome, and they followed instructions when we asked them to make everything less spicy ,coz of our child. Will recommend this restaurant. Its just 1 min walking distance from Thomson Rd ( Opp Novena Ch) 50031 bus stop. But if you visit via MRT ( Novena) it's 4 min walking distance,coz of construction going on the road.",

      "text": "Authentic Indian food cooked by chef from New Deli. Food is tasty and not bad. Naan is thin, fluffy and nice. Tandoori chicken is quite nice too but the butter chicken is too sweet. Chicken Bryani is not bad but we still prefer the Kerala style. The Masala Cha was very diluted. Masala tea cost $5.50 each for a very small cup and the small glass of lime soda at $5.90. Drinks are way too expensive. Masala chicken is $18 for a small portion. We ordered 4 cha masala (too diluted) , 1 lime soda (quite nice),2 garlic naan, 2 plain naan, 1 tandoori chicken, 1 dry Gobi Manchurian and 1 tandoori boneless chicken .With Eatigo 30% discount, we paid about $105 for 5 of us. Price is on the high side without Eatigo.",
