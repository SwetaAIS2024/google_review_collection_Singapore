Georgina Lum,1,"My stay at the Dorsett Singapore was extremely disappointing. The location of the hotel is convenient, however, coupled with the poor rooms and the poor service from the concierge (in particular, from Germaine). I would not stay here again.

Upon arrival, we noticed that our keycard was not activating the lights in the room. In fact, the system fell off the wall upon insertion  and we had to request for a room change. Also, the layout of the bathroom was poorly thought out and was very uncomfortable to use. The sink was also scuffed and some tiles had noticeable cracks in the bathroom.

There was no apology due to the condition of the room and the reception gave us the impression that it was an inconvenience for a room change. Later on in the evening, we requested for an extra duvet, however, over the phone, a reply of ""It might take a while.."" was unpleasant to receive.

Moreover, although the pool closed at 8pm, by 7:45, the lights had been dimmed and the environment was near pitch black, a health and safety +/- accident-in-waiting.

Although the location of the hotel may be tempting, I would encourage others to book elsewhere.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114233495781579897771/reviews
Kevin Traynor,4,"The rooms are looking old and used. The room has a 1.4 litre fridge and kettle and that's it, no coffee machine for an upper class hotel or bottled water. Staff outstanding and helpful but next time I'll try another.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101533220001873949986/reviews
indra putra,4,"Great Stay but Housekeeping Needs Improvement

I had a good stay at Dorsett Singapore. The room was comfortable, and overall, my experience was pleasant. The staff were friendly, and the hotel had a nice atmosphere.

However, one thing that needs improvement is housekeeping. During my stay, the shower gel ran out, and it wasn’t refilled. It’s a small detail, but regular checks would make the experience even better.

Other than that, everything was great, and I would consider staying here again!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114557910951737120264/reviews
Erika T,4,"Comfortable beds.
Rooms are on the smaller size, but fine.
Not enough hooks for hanging towels, bathrobes etc.
They need hand rails in the showers.
They restrict the amount of shower gel, and other bathroom products you can use.
I had to ask for more hand soap, towels.
It is right next door to a train metro, easy access to everything.
The poolside beds are AWFUL,so uncomfortable.
There is a laundry on level 7 which is very handy.
All in all a pleasant stay, just some easy improvments could be applied",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102403986239689754153/reviews
Sue Duong,4,"02-22-2025 23rd, 24th, 25th and 26th
We stayed in Room 923 for 5 nights, around $152 per night total of $763 with taxes and fees.

Irene checked us in when we arrived. She was professional and helpful. Our interactions with her were positive. Very convenient location. Didn’t have a chance to use the pool nor the gym therefore cannot comment on these two facilities.

We enjoyed our visit here. Hopefully, will have a chance to return.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110252304392731387034/reviews
