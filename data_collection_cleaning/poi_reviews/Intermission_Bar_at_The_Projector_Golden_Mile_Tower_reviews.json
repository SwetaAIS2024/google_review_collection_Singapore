I got the karaage ($12) and the portion was average, tastes exactly like frozen karaage from NTUC so I wouldnâ€™t recommend ðŸ’” the pepperoni pizza ($18) was also a 5/10, rlly thin crust and the tomato based sauce was way too sweet\n\nThe loaded nachos and toasties looked better though so I would recommend those instead",
