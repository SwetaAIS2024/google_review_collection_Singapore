Lyon Bakes,4,"Newly opened at People’s Park. Took over the same spot as Ya kun previously.

Tried the laksa set which came with kopi or tea. It’s tasty, not too spicy just nice for me. Less lemak and leaning towards more dried shrimp flavor.

Nasi Lemak wasn’t available yet. Hope to try it next time.

Be early to grab seats during lunchtime hours.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107552928553169969294/reviews
