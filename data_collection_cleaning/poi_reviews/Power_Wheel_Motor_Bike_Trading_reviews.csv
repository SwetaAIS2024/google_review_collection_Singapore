Chris Stephan,5,"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews for this place. Went there yesterday for my ODU install. Didn't even have a booking, I was just given their name by a good friend of mine. I showed up at 4:30pm and it was all done and dusted in about an hour. They even put new terminals on the battery connections for free. They also welded a cracked bracket on my top box. I was so impressed as it saved me a lot of money... I will definitely go back.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113255387775508838607/reviews

John 3:16,1,"Very Dishonest scam shop. Full of lies. Don't believe a single word they say.

They Tried to scam with high pressure sales tactics and many lies to get us to repair things that were fine, but luckily left to seek another opinion, and found out this whole shop is a very dishonest dirty lying scam shop.

Leslie Aw,5,Mechanics are experienced and fast. It's reasonably priced although some reviews here says otherwise. I rather pay for a good workmanship than shoddy works by some shops I've been to. Period.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114999601025365170336/reviews
