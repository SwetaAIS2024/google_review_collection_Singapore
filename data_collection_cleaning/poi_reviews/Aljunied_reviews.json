The station is very spacious with car parks, bike park, surrounding with shop houses and restaurants.\n\nWe stayed in Geylang on our last visit and it is very convenience to as the Station is just a few hundred meters from our hotel, and itâ€™s the same line back-and-forth to the Changi Airport. Love the place, and whenever we alight from the MRT, the station makes us feels like home.",

Plenty good eateries around with ample parking space in front of the station. Lot of bike rack space as well. Only minus is that as it is above above ground, the platform is open space and there is no AC so it can get hot at times, but luckily the trains are pretty frequent.",
