Brenda Chong,5,"I recently dined at Yi Jia Le Wah Chye Seafood Zi Char, and I must say the dining at 华仔 was an exceptional experience. The standout feature of this place has to be the generous servings – they are truly enormous! You definitely get excellent value for your money here.

It's not just about quantity, the quality of the food is equally impressive. Every dish I tried (Assam fish head, Har Cheong Gai - Fried chicken dish) was bursting with flavour, and the freshness of the seafood was undeniable, especially 麦片虾. The flavours were perfectly balanced, and I was particularly impressed by the skillful preparation of their dishes.

It was an ideal spot for a casual meal with friends or family. The staff were attentive and helpful, providing recommendations and ensuring our dining experience was enjoyable.

In conclusion, Yi Jia Le Wah Chye Seafood Zi Char is a must-visit for anyone who appreciates delicious food and sizable portions. I left the restaurant with a satisfied palate and a desire to return for more. This place certainly lives up to its reputation as an awesome dining destination.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108622247868539113095/reviews

Patrick Ng,1,"Superior lousy service.. staff are always blur like sotong. Always will mess up your orders.  Or give wrong dishes from other tables. You can order small but they secretly change to large! Very dishonest. Not the first time experience this. All the smokers smoking around you. But the positive review is, when you take away as their food is of standard",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114574710459403942472/reviews
Euphorie Liew,4,"The food is not bad, love the KangKong with many chilli. Prawn Paste Chicken Wings is fabulous crispy and flavorful, not oily at all. The Fish Maw with Sea Cucumber and Veggies is yummy too. Sweet Sour Pork is quite tender and the flavour is just nice!

However, the steam Teochew Style Fish is a bit way too salty to my liking. And the fish is kinda small though we requested for a bigger fish.

The place is quite crowded during dinner time. And reservation is needed if you want them to set up your table with the pink table cloth. Service is not available if you request on the spot.  And the space is quite limited.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102306923068386332783/reviews
