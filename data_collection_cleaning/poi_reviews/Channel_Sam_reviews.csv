H W,4,"3 of us ordered 3 dishes, total spent $80+.

It’s not our first time here, and we aware that the BBQ fish will need at least 50mins waiting time.

We arrived about 6:15pm, enjoying the sunset while waiting for the BBQ fish.

The view from the seat are really 5 stars, you will fall love with the view~

Staffs are less service oriented, but I am ok and try to understand after I watched the “money not enough”,  how difficult F&B industry on hiring local staffs.

Nothing is perfect, but so far the dishes we ordered, we are happy with it.
Will come again. Jia you!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116227057716701202386/reviews
YL Lim,1,"Visited the place with my family last night. Thought to have good food at good place, but very disappointed with the food!

I don’t usually put bad review but the dinner I had last night really made my heart pain as it really not worth the price. The only good food is the Erdinger Beer…

Flower crabs over fried
Sambal fried rice not nice
Hofan over cooked n too much dark soy sauce
Wine Lala taste bitter
Fish & chip too much flour
Lamb chop acceptable

Will not visit anymore",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112063539831689817326/reviews
Dr Reviews,4,"The restaurant is situated in a Beautiful location by the sea side.

Fantastic view to set the mood and hang out with friends,  family or even your colleagues.

It did not get noisy or loud which is wonderful for those who want to enjoy a drink or have their dinner by the sea.

In case of rain, diners are protected by the rolling shutters, which are promptly rolled up / down depending on weather conditions.

Service was alright and food was decent.  Beers were served really cold and you could request for more ice in your bucket.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112747621045786494145/reviews
Jialong Liu,4,"Knowing that the review is pretty bad (without looking at the comments yet), I still decided to give this place a TRY and...
It wasn't that bad actually!

While waiting for the food, I decided to look at the reviews and saw many posts mentioning Abt the slow food, the service and some lousy food... I was so worried of the slow-ness as I was really hungry when I arrived at 11.20pm.

But first dish (my seafood fried noodles $10) came at 11.38pm...not bad I thot. Then before I was even halfway into that, the other 3 dishes came, vongole pasta ($14), pork satays x 10 ($14), clayfish ($24). Oh yah...and my Erdinger dark ($13).

The seafood noodles was a tad too salty but it's savoury and some people would have loved it. Not much to shout about but nothing to complain too. My partner felt the vongole wasn't authentic but I didn't come here expecting an Italian style pasta anyway, so I thought it was alright too. The satays were pretty good although slightly overpriced. And the clawfish although not the freshest (you can choose between live and not), the garlic pepper was really good! I didn't even wanted to order at first seeing that it was $24 for 3 pieces as they looked really small in the fridge, but they actually gave us 5 pieces of it instead, which made it pretty value for money then.

The price of my beer was alright too and with the live band (single solo uncle singing Abit of Cantonese and some oldies) and nice environment beside the waters, I think it's a great night out chilling in the light breeze.

I suspect the management might have some of the earlier comments or for some other reasons decided to improve on their standards. I surely don't think they deserve a 2.8... and even the most critical person taking over my place tonight won't give lower than a 3.5 I can imagine...

So do come over and give them a try. Disclaimer... I came after 11pm so am not sure how it would be at an earlier time or if they were busier. Order those food which I did, and it shd still be a pretty good evening for u.

Overall, 7 out of 10. I don't mind coming back again and maybe singing a few songs with the companionship of the uncle playing his guitar!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109445082861542439922/reviews
Hao Long,4,"Saturday dinner.
We caught some fish from neighbor Gills Fishing and decided to cook it out here at Channel Sam. Breezy weather so it was quite nice sitting outdoor.
Food was ok, steamed fish was not bad and the BBQ platter was not bad too.
Less than SGD 40 per pax.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103075774690982722910/reviews
