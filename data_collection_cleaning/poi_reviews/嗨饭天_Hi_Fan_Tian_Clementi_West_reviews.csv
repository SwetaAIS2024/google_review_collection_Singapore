ronnie chan,5,Yummy fried rice and succulent pork chop only $6.50 at this newly opened stall at Clementi West. Can try their Mala noodle too. Their chicken wings are huge and flavourful.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106831360238977482868/reviews
Erica Zhao,5,"Love their fried rice, pork chop and chicken cutlet. It’s really nice and yummy! The 红油抄手 is also delicious! Had a good lunch with my friend! Do give it a try :)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117578210134596712931/reviews
Wilson Foo,5,"Very generous with the amount of egg and shrimps. For $6.50 egg fried rice with shrimps, the portion is sizable. Whilst it cannot claim to have every grain coated with egg, the fluffy grains were well separated from each other, evidence of thorough frying of overnight left over rice.

Very nice. Must return to try their other items especially the spicy wantan noodle.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263857328212431619/reviews
