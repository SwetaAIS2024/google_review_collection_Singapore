The chicken was not bad but the skin smells burnt and dry.\nPortion wise still acceptable as it is not cheap.\n\nService\n-Terrible service from counter, speak angrily to customer when his pronounciation is not clear. Besides, counter service person looks pissed when he is the one in the wrong. Worst experience ever. If not willing to work, please dont work. Totally banning this restaurant.\n\nAtmosphere\n-clean and bright hawker center, nothing special.",

Grew to like the onion rings.\n\nThose who gym nearby this is the place for your protein ( and cheat days).\n\nLast pics from visit today, I decide to flip the streak over. You can see Both Sides Now like Joni Mitchell.\n\n* went back but changed the 2 toppings. The potato croquette is damn nice.\n\nConsider the steak has been consistently good, and attractive price offered during time of high inflation, i up the stars to 5.\n\nI ordered different sides, I recommend potato croquettes.\n\nThey are paylah fav partner. So get your further cashback.\n\n10 dec 23 - went again. Today the serloin is tough though, not the usual quality. Lets observe who the chef is.",
