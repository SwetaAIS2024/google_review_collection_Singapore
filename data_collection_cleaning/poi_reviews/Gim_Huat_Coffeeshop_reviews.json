The curry sauce is curry sauce - not the hainanese type but it‚Äôs caifan curry sauce.\nThe dish is pretty oily but I think the rice can soak up the oils üòÖ\n\nAnother caifan stall (non-vegetarian) is also quite popular. It‚Äôs 5 dollars for what I got - chicken chop, brinjal, tofu and vegetable. More expensive slightly? But the curry sauce tastes lighter. Still a good one. There‚Äôs always a queue here haha",

They have several branches and the noodles taste very much like Kok Kee but much value for money (x2 portion) for the same price ($5)\n\nNeedless to say Sin Ming Roti Prata is among the best prata. Consistent and great taste üëç\n\nThe kopi, tea and toast is great too!",
