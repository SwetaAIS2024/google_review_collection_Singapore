Jarosław Zając,5,"Din Tai Fung in Singapore offers an exquisite dim sum experience perfect for sharing. From the soft, savoury steamed pork buns to the crispy deep-fried wantons, every dish was thoughtfully prepared and full of flavour. Highlights included the Steamed Yam Paste Xiao Long Bao, lotus root-studded handmade tofu, and aromatic truffle fried rice finished tableside. The roselle drink added a refreshing, floral touch to round off the meal. While the century eggs remain an acquired taste, the overall experience was a memorable way to end our time in Singapore.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116056564013497573445/reviews
