      "text": "1st time trying and ordered the pig stomach and intestine herbal soup with rice and fried dough fritter for $7. Soup taste ok only, not piping hot even thou using claypot, you do not find the soup bubbling. Pig stomach was good but the intestine was overcooked and not very clean so only ate few pieces and skip the rest.  Amount of soup was quite little and not enough for the dough fritters, rice was abit lumpy and i only ate half bowl. Overall average and will be my last time patronising, stall owner was also putting a grumpy face.",

Would not recommend the you tiao 油条 cause there is a weird taste like the smell of other food and not heated up.",
