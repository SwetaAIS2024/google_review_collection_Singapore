Cheers provides essential snacks drinks and a variety of assortments that one might need on a road trip. Then again, we are in Singapore how long can your road trip be? The main reason I gave this place a five star was the toilets. They have toilets at this fine establishment which would proof to be helpful in times of crisis when you’re on the road and urgently need a toilet this is the place to go. So mark your maps for this is an establishment with a Public Toilet!",
