chiranjeet narayan dev,5,"Lot One Shoppers' Mall in Choa Chu Kang is a fantastic shopping destination that caters to a wide range of needs. Conveniently located next to the Choa Chu Kang MRT station, it offers easy access for both locals and visitors. The mall features a diverse mix of retail stores, from popular fashion brands to electronics and lifestyle shops, ensuring there's something for everyone.

One of the highlights is the variety of dining options available, ranging from fast food to casual dining, making it a great spot for meals after a shopping spree. The food court is particularly impressive, offering a mix of local and international cuisines that cater to different tastes.

The mall is well-maintained, with clean facilities and a welcoming atmosphere. Families will appreciate the kid-friendly spaces, including play areas that keep little ones entertained. Additionally, the mall often hosts events and promotions that add to the shopping experience.

Overall, Lot One is not just a shopping center; it’s a community hub where you can relax, dine, and shop all in one place. I highly recommend visiting if you're in the area!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110590788353072024046/reviews
akanksha rai,5,"It’s a compact yet well-equipped neighborhood mall located right next to Choa Chu Kang MRT and LRT stations, making it super convenient for residents and commuters alike. It’s not a mega mall, but it packs in the essentials—from retail stores and a NTUC FairPrice supermarket to a library, cinema (Cathay Cineplex), and food court.

The mall has a good mix of local and international brands, and the upper levels are home to clinics, enrichment centers, and family-friendly services. It’s a great place to run errands, grab a bite, or catch a movie without traveling far.

While it may not be a major shopping destination like Orchard or VivoCity, Lot One is a solid go-to for everyday needs and casual hangouts. It’s clean, accessible, and gets the job done.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113305538749634568248/reviews
Joyce “Joyful Explorer”,5,"Love the CCK Library at Lot One. Its study and multimedia zone is open from 9am to 10pm everyday. During the hours when the library (the books area) is yet to open (normally between 11am to 9pm), no staff will be around at this zone to assist. You can book a seat on NLB app or scan the QR code at the table to use the computers or for self study. Entrance near Fun Toast Level 4.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116040496274789301932/reviews

jimmy lee,5,"A nice and fairly large neighborhood mall that is conveniently located just in front of the Choa Chu Kang mrt station. They have most of the amenities here. Fairprice supermarket at B1, Foodcourt at L4, national library at L4 & L5, Shaw Cineplex at L5 & L6. There are also plenty of other F&B dining outlets and retail stores.
