Christian Rehbein,5,"We had a fantastic experience with Alpha Green Preschool! Our daughter absolutely loved the place and quickly made new friends. The supportive administration made our sudden departure from the country much easier to handle. The amazing package they offer stands out, especially in the overpriced market of Singapore. Highly recommended!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112978924358365250989/reviews

Ningsih Utomo,5,"We had some requirements when it comes to choosing our son pre school and it was not easy for us to look for the ideal and I am so glad that we decided to enroll him in Alpha Green!
I am beyond greatful to the team of teachers here for their sincerity and care in transitioning our toddler adapt in school from learning about our toddler’s likes and dislikes to providing update on his progress and activity.
This school approach is also well balanced between academic curriculum to a free play based approach both indoor and outdoor.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102551226882311723731/reviews
caroline marley,5,A lovely preschool with fantastically dedicated teachers. My little boy really enjoyed his time here and made excellent progress.

Oxana Shilina,4,"The main reason we have chosen this school for our son 1.5 years ago is the trilingual approach, which is unique in Singapore so far if I'm not mistaken. The combination of Russian, English and Chinese languages is quite rare and we are so happy we managed to find it! Our son now is 5.5 years old and he has graduated from Alpha Green recently. We are sad that we have to find another solution to keep all three languages flowing as the school has done it perfectly!
The good care for children coupled with creative and holistic approach to education makes the school standing out. Huge thank you to all staff for support and care, initiatives and information  during our son's stay there. We really appreciate the knowledge and fun he experienced there!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114943354277394810468/reviews
