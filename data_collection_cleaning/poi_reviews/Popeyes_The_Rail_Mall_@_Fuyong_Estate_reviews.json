Corn burger doesn’t go well with salted egg.\n\nThe two spicy wing is pathetic, small and not spicy at all. Plus it’s not even nice. Hard and over cooked.\n\nWorse experience for Popeyes. They need to improve their cooking skill or they will be out in this market of fast food.",

The biscuits are great too. Overall good quality for a fast food outlet.\n\nPerhaps they could give buzzers or increase the size of the order number on the screen instead of having to shout each number manually..",
