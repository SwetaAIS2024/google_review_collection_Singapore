Cel Whong,1,"This is the worst security guard I ever come across, he asked for Q no, I said not given but saw my helper's name on his list. Pointed out to him n said Q no 4. He verified passport n still refused to believe n asked for more until I showed him my whatapps conversation with the embassy. Then he let my helper in n stopped me in  a very rude way. Helper came out to get some cash from me to pay tax, this guard used sharp point item to poke my back shoulder hard n caused me great pain, I turned back n he said ""I told u there is car coming out!!!"". The fact was he told everyone outside the gate, not me, n I was sorting out what my helper trying to tell me... Obviously he is not happy with his job n this is my worst experience with Myanmar embassy!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107457842465870522447/reviews
Stephanie Zheng,1,Not even 1 star. The worst embassy with stupid officer! Online appointment doesn’t work at all times and no slot available. Came here 4times and still unable to renew my helper passport. Different officer told me different things! It's such a waste of time and effort. Please do something about it to help everyone's life easier..,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117169796399614253218/reviews

Hsu Pyei Kmita,1,"I would give a 0 star if I could.

Went today to renew my passport. I have gotten married and took my husband's last name so I asked the officer if I could change it and which documents would be needed. One of the officers told me to check with the other officer in the payment room.
I went to the payment room and ask the previously mentioned officer just to be told off rudely that he is dealing with a lot of people right now and can't explain to me again (which he never did in the first place). He was lying down on his back using his phone, does not seem like he was busy.

It is unacceptable to treat people like this.
Online system is useless too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107179031135229108820/reviews
