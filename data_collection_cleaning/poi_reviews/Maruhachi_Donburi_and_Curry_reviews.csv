William Lu,5,"Loved it. Good choice of Japanese food around the area. katsu was crispy and I loved the salad with the sauce. I would love to try their curry next time.

Take away charge is 50 cents extra. It came with miso soup as well, hence, 50 cents for 2 containers.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
TTT,5,"Tried the new menu priced at $10.80, it taste good and food was serve quite fast. Just that I don't find the price worth it especially dining in a non-aircon coffeeshop.

This coffeeshop have a smoking corner and it is warm, so in my own personal opinion pricing can adjust lower.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100686562262088270083/reviews
Ethan Lim,5,"Love the curry rice. I tried the chicken karaage curry rice and I was very satisfied. Also ordered the black pig don to try and the pork had much fat, but it is quite good. Definitely will return to try other food.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109021816801063798064/reviews
Min HL,5,"Super duper solid and got standard! Do come here and give it a try if you are craving for legit tonkatsu!!
