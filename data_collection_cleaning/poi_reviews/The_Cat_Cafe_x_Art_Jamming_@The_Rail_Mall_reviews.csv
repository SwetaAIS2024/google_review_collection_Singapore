Len!,5,Cozy cat cafe which is close to the entrance of Rail Mall. Extremely unfortunate about hearing this cafe close down around March 2026. Attached are various photos I have taken of the cats roaming around the cafe. Sushi was absolutely a chill cat even though the owners said she would bite. Hope all the cats will be safely rehomed after the closure.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100966609987030670829/reviews
Cheiro Theorem,5,"The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, is a perfect spot to relax and unwind. The staff were friendly, both to us and the cats, and they clearly prioritize the well-being of the animals.
The cats themselves were adorable and well cared for, with plenty of playful and affectionate personalities to go around. I appreciated the variety of toys and spaces provided for them, which allowed them to interact naturally without feeling stressed.
The menu had a decent selection of beverages and snacks, but, I didn’t pay much attention to the taste of the food because I was too busy enjoying the cats. The café also maintained a good balance of cleanliness and comfort, which can be tricky with so many furry friends around.
Overall, this is a must-visit for cat lovers or anyone looking for a unique and calming café experience. I’ll definitely be coming back!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106441412113355113329/reviews
darren,5,"After visiting a cat cafe before to compare it with, this one was like 10 times better. Felt like the cats were treated really well and the staff were really passionate with their work and very sociable.

This is a cat cafe I would reccomend you to go if you wanna also art jam, as I also took it up. It came with a free drink as well! Even without the art jam, this is a worthwhile cat cafe to visit.

All the cats felt very well taken care off, and will definitely come back again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118101017295074717603/reviews
Jo L,4,"Went for art jamming, booked via WhatsApp. The paints were mostly clogged and hard to pump out. Staff didn't look very friendly and kept playing with the cats on their own. Overall still had a good experience here.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110213543929094512296/reviews
Lee Wei Ming,5,Calming and relaxing atmosphere with all the rescued cats around. Sad that all the cats were napping when I arrived but it's still a nice experience to have all the different breeds around,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115374090225926444007/reviews
