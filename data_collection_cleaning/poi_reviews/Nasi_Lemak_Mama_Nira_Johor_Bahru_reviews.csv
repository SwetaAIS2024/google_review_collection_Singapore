Raiyan Safiy,5,"The best nasi lemak ever ! Tried this many times . The akak was so nice with her husband and daughter. As usual, i always try their delicious rendang daging and paru sambal! Feels like the dish taking me back to my hometown! Please come early as those two sold out fast! The price is very affordable! For two overflow dish with only 12 dollar !",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109798320136841460017/reviews
Mark Tan,2,"Inconsistent pricing. Ate there at least 4 times and for the same foods which I ordered each time together with a friend, the bill can range from RM15.50 to RM18.00 for just a nasi lemak telur and another which is ayam. This is the price for 2 plates of road side nasi lemak without drinks?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104102481118215309528/reviews
