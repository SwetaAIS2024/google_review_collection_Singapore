Ana RiVi,5,"Our daughter joined the school in N2 and is now in G1, and we couldn’t be happier with our experience. The school is well-structured, and the teachers are professional, caring, and truly dedicated to the children’s growth. Academically, it is strong, and we’ve seen great progress in our child’s learning and confidence.

Our daughter is thriving and absolutely loves her school, which is the most important thing to us. If anything, improving the meals at school could make the experience even better.

We are grateful for the nurturing environment and look forward to more great years ahead!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114525615390700477657/reviews
S.A,1,"I am deeply disappointed with Middleton's handling of my son’s application. The school relied on an old school report that was not a true reflection of him and refused to consider updated information or even grant a brief meeting to clarify the situation. Despite my repeated efforts, I was told that he would not be granted admission, even though he had not formally applied for the current cohort.

It is unfair to make assumptions about a child without proper assessment or understanding of their current progress.

The school’s lack of flexibility and apparent prejudice left me disheartened. I hope Middleton reflects on its processes to ensure fairer treatment for future families.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112214261426836025928/reviews

Mrigank,2,Not much point in writing a proper review as the standard template replies show that the school doesn't actually care. The school doesn't seem to hold any responsibility for anything.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108190042544668420086/reviews
