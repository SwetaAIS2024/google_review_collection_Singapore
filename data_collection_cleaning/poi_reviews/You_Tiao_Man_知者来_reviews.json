Revisited this stall after many years and found the fritter too thick . Was expecting it to be more fluffy inside.  I had one today that was fluffy on one half and full on the other.  A bit disappointing.",

Plenty of salted sections all over the insides, unlike the ones from other stalls which dont have much salted sections.\n\nThe butterfly bun was also top-notch. Delicious sesame taste, and not-too-sweet.\n\nTwo thumbs up and will definitely come back again.",
