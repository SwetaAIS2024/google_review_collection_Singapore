Chengwen Chen,5,"Over the past year, we’ve witnessed remarkable growth in Ella’s musical skills and confidence. Your patience and enthusiasm have made each lesson both enjoyable and engaging. Here are a few highlights from this year:
1. Enhanced Technique: Ella has demonstrated significant improvement in her overall piano technique. She is able to play more complicated piano pieces and play quite fluently. This advancement is a clear reflection of your effective teaching methods and encouragement.
2. Boosted Confidence: We’ve noticed a considerable increase in Ella’s confidence, both in her playing and her willingness to perform. She enjoys playing for me and letting me record her performances. She also takes the initiative to read and practice new pieces on her own before you teach them. I believe Ms Seah’s efforts of organizing recitals every year is having positive impact on her.
3. Steady Progress: Ella has consistently improved her sight-reading and piano skills. She earned a merit in her Grade 3 exam earlier this year and is now preparing for her Grade 4 exam. Ms Seah’s structured approach in each lesson has been highly beneficial.
We especially appreciate her flexibility and understanding regarding Ella’s individual needs and learning pace. While she loves music, she can be quite impatient and has a short attention span. The teacher’s personalized approach has greatly enhanced her progress and enjoyment of the lessons.
Looking ahead to the coming year, we are excited to continue this musical journey with Ms Seah and are eager to support Ella’s growth in any way we can.
Thank you once again for your dedication, passion, and the positive impact you’ve had on Ella’s musical education. We truly value your role in her learning experience and are deeply grateful for everything you do.
Warmest regards,
Wendy
