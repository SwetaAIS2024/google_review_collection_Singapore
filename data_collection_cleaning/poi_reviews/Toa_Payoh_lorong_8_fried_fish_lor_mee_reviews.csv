C,2,The lor mee is really quite bad and bland. Have to rely on the garlic and chilli. The fried fish and ngor Hiang are quite ok though,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115032798890691535385/reviews
Ivan Michael Pung,3,"This stall is famous for their Lor Mee. With Lor Mee, you get options with fried fish, popcorn chicken or a combination of both. They also have a signature Laksa

And today I ordered the Laksa. The Laksa unfortunately doesn’t live up to the recommendation. Without the chill, it is just, normal. Nothing fancy about it and I couldn’t taste the Le-Mah moment.

If visiting, best to stick to the Lor Mee",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100551027047446956883/reviews
Benjamin Liew,2,"The food is not a very good rendition of this braised noodle. It is passable. I order big at dollars at the time of writing. The ngoh hiang is razor thin and is fried at this razor thin thickness. It became fritters instead of the usual juicy ngoh hiang, outside crispy and inside juicy. The fish is fried well, but barely any fish inside, mostly crispy fried batter. The braise sauce is okay, but not very fragrance though the thickness is just right. Overall I would give it a pass but not one to travel to from afar for this. There are other reditions, like popcorn chicken etc. But I think it'd missing the soul of Lor mee, if throwing small pieces of fried stuff on braised noodle is your thing perhaps then this is worth your while. But really, there are stronger contenders for Lor mee and this is not one of them that hits the mark for me.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115177929105027213863/reviews
Sean Goh,3,"Chance upon this Lor mee stall the last time I was here for the wanton noodle on the same stretch. This shop specialised in lor mee, Apart from the standard traditional lor mee, they also serves lor mee with popcorn chicken, fried fish or even both. A bowl of lor mee starts from SGD$3 onwards.

I had the fried fish lor mee, which was SGD$4. it comes with 2-3 pieces of fried fish, thinly slice nor hiang, braised egg and pork. You can help yourself to the condiment of vinegar, garlic and chili.

Gravy has nice consistency, but sadly it was missing in flavor.  It would actually be a decent bowl of lor mee if the flavor is much better. Fried fish was still crispy despite drenched in the gravy which is a plus point. the nor hiang is actually not bad too!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Ed K,3,"Saw a queue there and was hopeful the Lor Mee can satisfy my hunger.

Order the Double Fried version (fried fish and fried pop corn chicken), taste of the fried fried fish and chicken is good. But the Lor lack of some omph! No base vinegar taste. The chilli paddy is good though",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100072228661137795605/reviews
