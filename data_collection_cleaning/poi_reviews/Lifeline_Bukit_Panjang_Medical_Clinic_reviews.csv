Felix Lam,5,"Funny how people mentioned Dr Alan Chin is arrogant etc. Dr Alan has been my familyâ€™s preferred go to doctor for more than 25 years when weâ€™re sick. He saved my life once when i was misdiagnosed at many clinics for gastro problems, but he immediately diagnosed me with appendicitis and sent me for surgery asap because it has been a week.

Iâ€™d recommend Dr Alan anytime, you donâ€™t have to like his face, eyes or attitude etc. Imho I would prefer a good doctor thatâ€™s arrogant than a clueless one whoâ€™s soft and kind.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103803173741684872930/reviews
