Online ordering was easy and fuss free, and they got back to me the next day to confirm my order. Melvin who came to help set up the buffet was punctual, friendly and very patient in helping us decide the table set up given the space constraints we had. The food was tasty- garlic ebiko fried rice was full of garlic fragrance, chicken rendang was very flavourful (but may be on the spicy side for some) and the taste of nonya chap chye took us my surprise too! Not forgetting the red velvet cream cheese and rich walnut brownie. Iced lemon tea was not diluted/watered down like other caterers. All in all, an extremely value for money quality catering that I‚Äôll definitely engage again :)",
