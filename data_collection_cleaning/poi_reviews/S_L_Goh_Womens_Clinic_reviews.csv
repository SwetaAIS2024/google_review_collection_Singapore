hling,5,"This is my second pregnancy under the care of Dr. Goh. My first pregnancy with her was smooth and uncomplicated. However, this second pregnancy has been quite different from the first.

I was diagnosed with preeclampsia, but Dr. Goh closely monitored my condition and made a firm, timely decision that we could not delay delivery any further. She emphasized the importance of delivering as soon as possible for the safety of both myself and my baby.

Throughout the process, Dr. Goh has always been patient in answering all my questions. When it came to making critical decisions, she remained calm, firm, and reassuring, giving me great confidence that both my baby and I were in safe hands.

I highly recommend Dr. Goh to anyone looking for a dedicated and experienced obstetrician. You will definitely be in good hands. I also want to thanks the wonderful staff at Dr. Gohâ€™s clinic â€” they have always been attentive and helpful in addressing all my pregnancy-related queries.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103769541017811370962/reviews
