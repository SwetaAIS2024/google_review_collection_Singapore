      "text": "It is located very convenient place just next to Novena MRT Exit. I visited place several times and felt the quality of service is good. All therapists are professional and I am satisfied with every visit.  Despite busy location, the place is very quiet and I can enjoy my quiet time here.   They have 2 branches near by and this B1 place is not too busy, so another convenience for me is easy to book, as I am always running tight schedule.  I think price can be better, it is not the place like China town cheap massage places, but offer hood balance between quality and price. I am sure I will go back again.",

      "text": "My hubby and I make it a point to visit once a month. We have our preferred therapists but we experienced different ones too during our visits. All of them are professional and very good at what they do! The foot reflexology is quite thorough and level of strength can be requested. We normally do a one hour reflexology followed by 30 or 40 minutes shoulder and back massage. The shoulder and back massage is very good to relieve tension and knots. This is our monthly treat and we always feel good after a session there. Do make reservations and check out their combos before deciding on which is preferred. It’s a little pricey but it’s worth it!",

The masseuses are in general non-chatty, which is good if you like enjoying your massage in quiet. Medical staff working in the area qualify for special prices - just ask at the counter.",
