V Ng,1,"Worst burger I've ever eaten. How can an established restaurant serve patties this dry? Not only the patty is dry, it is salty and the buns are tough. Measly one piece of lettuce and a silver of tomato. For $20, I can easily get better burgers elsewhere even in coffeeshops.

Decided to try out Pigsfly establishment since it's been at Katong for a long time so food should be good right? Wrong. Biggest mistake of my Friday night and what a waste of calories. Food took awhile to come as well.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109841896758202273531/reviews
Christopher O'Grady,2,"We live in the area. Decided to go out for a burger. $22 for a cheeseburger and realised the lemonade we ordered was $9 each? Total was $71. Sours the meal a bit when a casual burger night without alcohol is that expensive.

I understand prices are going up and their landlord probably raised their rent to.

BUT WE'RE NOT PAYING $71 FOR BURGERS AND LEMONADES!!!!

There has to be a breaking point where food is too expensive and we quit eating out. This $71 meal was our breaking point.

Edit after reading their reply about using the freshest ingredients: I think what pushed this bill over the edge was the $9 lemonades.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112584980403682372606/reviews
Andrew Fisher,2,"Below average burgers, even with the upgraded beef patty. Uninspiring bun, sweet filings and a beef patty that really fails to shine with no flavour.
Chips are just freezer supermarket grade. Crinkle cut should not be greasy and undercooked like this.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108874833979292225992/reviews
Tiantian Tang,5,"They don't have the best burger in the world, But they had the best burger i have never had in Singapore(actually better than some of the place in the US).

I've been to both locations many times: The Foundry(now closed) and PigsFly.
Yea, sounds confusing, they are not a restaurant, they are more like a mini food court with 4-5 different kitchen.

I loved their burger even fries were good!! The burger just so tasty and juicy, cooked just right when you bite, it just melt in mouth:P

Highly re-commanded for those who crave a good burger in Singapore!",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109227333808688485711/reviews
William Yap,2,"Never come here for the burgers. It’s a good area / good place for drinks with friends, but avoid if you’re needing a burger fix",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115527752495914177529/reviews
