cheyenne cheng,2,"always come for a sashimi here since its affordable. Yesterday, i ordered a sashimi as well as a crab-stick sushi. Don't know if it was the crab stick or the sashimi but i got a food poisoning from it. (it was the only meal i ate yesterday). very disappointed and not be ordering those again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113455122906879457920/reviews
Jeremy Chan,5,"First time trying a sushi takeaway.

Price played a huge factor -$6.90 for this salmon chirashi bowl/don.  It was pretty nice.

Price comparison :
Pao Pao fan -$6.50
Qiqi mee rebus $4+ (no meat)
Qiqi mee rebus special $5+??
Food court fried chicken and rice $5-6+

So it was like no brainer for $6.90 for Japanese cuisine.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107031205335562689738/reviews
