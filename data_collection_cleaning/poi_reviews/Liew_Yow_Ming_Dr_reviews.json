And the second time was when I had an injury on my left knee (I couldn't walk properly due to the pain and swelling in my knee).\nHe helped to treat my injury with utmost care, and I recovered well and thankfully it is OK until now.\nI would strongly recommend him to anyone who needs his expert help and treatment.\nI had since referred a number of friends (including some from overseas) to Dr Liew, and all are satisfied with his professional approach to take care of the issues.\nThanks Dr Liew. Well done.",
