The place is quite hidden, you would see a lot restaurants in the front with small pathway to here because of big indoor sport covered it from the front. Maybe because of this as well, cause I couldn't find the place when I visited here.",

Pad Thai is very appetizing. Waiting time is way too long for each individual dishes. Milk tea is super sweet. Recommend wearing long pants or apply mosquito repellent to avoid “intimate kiss” by mosquitoes.",
