Vincent Khoo,3,"Short and rather flat jungle trail within Sentosa Island. Good to walk inside here while listening to cricket sound. The bad part is you can hear loud music from the other corner of the island, which spoil the serenity and calmness this track should have. Found a beautiful chameleon along the way though.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845981260181580873/reviews

Noreen M,5,"The trail is friendly for seniors and kids. It is very safe. If you want some extra, you may include or even start at the Fort Siloso.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107460664194828523552/reviews
Balasubramanian G,5,"The trail is beautiful to walk though. It is also extremely easy and anyone with less than ideal fitness can make it through. The trial takes less than an hour to complete and has quite a bit of picturesque mini falls along the way.
Don't miss this place if you are planning a visit to the Sentosa Islands.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109833106350673095521/reviews
H敲슷 L칙m,5,"I find it strange when a few local people and travellers know about this trail!!! If you are a nature-lover as well as sport-lover you need to be visiting this amazing trail once!

In the first place, me and my friends want to buy a cable-ticket to comeback to Vivocity but the price is not kinda reasonable so we dicided to take this trail and its been a really splendid journey for all of Us

Along the trail are breath-taking flora, when you take a stroll you could observe gently the beauty of the forrest located in this island!!! Following the road, I heard a tons of sound from birds and monkey which make this place more vibrant 游녨游낕

When you come through the forrest you can see the city clearly!!!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110129343504619896070/reviews
