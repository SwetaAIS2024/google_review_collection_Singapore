Steph Yeap,5,"Came here on a Friday evening with some friends and had a fantastic time. Food was scrumptious, flavours intense and tasty. We started with some Avocado creme and tortilla chips ($12) which was nice.

The mains were available for 1 for 1 deals on the Entertainer app, we highly recommend the
Ginger lemongrass noodles ($18) - which tastes like pasta in Thai green curry and is very fragrant, and the Linguine carbonara ($18) - rich creamy carbonara. Also good was the miso cured salmon ($21) and spaghetti aglio olio ($18). Additionally not under Entertainer was the Pork belly ($28) - crispy and quite nice, though not as tender as we would have liked.

Overall 5/5 rating, would come back here. Surprised that not more people were here dining as it was deserving of a bigger crowd.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116285915257675501811/reviews
Eric D.,4,Went there for company dinner on Friday evening. Very accessible from CBD area. Parking is easy nearby at the Sail as well. Food is decent but it was a pity they ran out of octopus. Staff are professional and attentive. A little pricy of course due to its location.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107228514290230824692/reviews
Baran Ozkan,2,"Caesar salad had sand, lettuce not washed well. They claimed it was black pepper, I eat black pepper for 40 years, that was funny how they think people cant tell sand from pepper.

They still charged the plate with some discount (almost fully uneaten)

Nice staff.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112577294122843079373/reviews
Ananda Yogi,3,"Nice and chill. Food was tasty though portion size was on the small side for the mains, perhaps justifiable for the price point. Cocktail list was extensive but taste-wise only so so.  Service was friendly!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117304545578684530007/reviews
Livia,5,Was here for dinner but ended up just having free flow drinks instead. $30 for ladies from 5 to 8 on Wednesdays; choose from a selection of cocktails or house pours and more. Service was impeccable and ambience was chic. Would definitely return to try the mains!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116594601122806473772/reviews
