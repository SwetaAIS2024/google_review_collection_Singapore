sethu meenakshi,5,"It's been 7 months since we enrolled our son in Global tots and we had a very smooth journey and wish the same continues. We really love the infrastructure of the school which gives us the homely atmosphere and their outdoor garden and classroom is very spacious. Teachers are very polite and we could able to see very nice bond between our kid and the teachers. We love their curriculum which involves learning with reusable and creative activities currated by the staff.
Currently we are getting the food timetable which includes only lunch menu. It will be helpful if the management adds the breakfast and snack details in the menu for us to have a track on their food intake in school.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114016146824327928987/reviews
