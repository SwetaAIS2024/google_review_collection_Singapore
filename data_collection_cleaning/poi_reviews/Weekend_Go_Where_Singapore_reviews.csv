Julie Wong,5,"I saw promotions for a 5-day, 4-night cruise to Krabi and Penang online and decided to reach out via WhatsApp. Carol responded quickly and was incredibly helpful, addressing all my questions. We thoroughly enjoyed the cruise, and my children absolutely loved it as well.

It was worth every penny! I‚Äôm already planning to book the cruise again for my kids holidays in June and December 2025. I highly recommend Carol as an agent; she will ensure you get a great deal. We loved our Resort World cruise! Thank you, Carol, for helping us secure such an amazing
experience!

Kathy Lim MH,5,"Excellent Service & Unforgettable Batam Trip!

I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to WeekendGoWhere, especially to Jamie, for the outstanding service provided. From the moment we inquired about the trip to the completion of our 2D1N stay at Batam KTM Resort, everything was seamless and well-organized.

Jamie‚Äôs responsibility and accountability were truly commendable. Her fast and furious response to our inquiries and requests made the entire booking process smooth and hassle-free. She ensured that every detail was taken care of, giving us a stress-free and enjoyable experience.

My girlfriend and I had an amazing getaway, creating wonderful memories at KTM Resort. The stay was fantastic, and we truly appreciated the excellent coordination and service from Jamie and the team.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a reliable and efficient travel agency! We will definitely book with WeekendGoWhere again for our next trip!

Thank you, Jamie, for your dedication and top-notch service!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102280854129854109030/reviews
Chai Setkhoon,5,"This is my first time booking with Weekend GoWhere through Carol for a 4 D 3N Genting Dream Cruise to Phuket (24 to 27 Dec 24). I saw their promotions via facebook.

Carol is very responsive throughout my queries. Everything was done through whatsApp. Booking, payment and check-in are all done electronically, making the process even easier.

Carol managed to arrange cabins at the same level for my family both Interior Stateroom & Balcony. It helped us a lot for were when we need to meet up for activities in the Cruise (this not in my request).

Thanks, Carol for the great service and arrangement.

Overall, very easy and fuss free to book from Weekend GoWhere.

Definitely will look for her again for my next family gateway!
