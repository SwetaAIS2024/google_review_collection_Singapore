S Raveen,5,"Came here on a Saturday night, they had live music and all tables were occupied. The food was good, their special drink tasted diluted. The service was quick and the staff were responsive. Had a pleasant experience, would return! Do join their membership programme if you would like a free shot on the house.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109879609155613363458/reviews

Priscila,4,"The atmosphere, the 80s music sung by Kathir and Latha was spectacular.We will patronise Semma again for The Rolling Good Times.

The food will be 3.5/5 as it used to be way better than what we used to have it last year. Thank you Semma!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107233030251391375140/reviews
J C John,4,"Decided to try this food joint for lunch. Tried a variety of dishes (Prata, mutton, prawn, biriyani, Madras tea). Pleasantly surprised with the pleasing minimalistic setup. The ambiance was good. Ordered the food and It was a surprise to see quick Service. Did not have to wait long at all. Coming to food ... The best was
the amazingly soft Roti Parata (Plain, Egg, cheese). Pepper Prawn was just awesome. Not spicy but it had the right blend of taste. Gravy was good with Parata. Also had Mysore mutton, again the gravy was good. mutton was a bit hard and pieces were chunky,  not as great as I expected.  Biryani was just average. Last but not the least, the Madras tea. It was well made. Perfect tasting tea to go with the food.
Overall it was good experience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106261886521267575560/reviews
Saadhana Amba,5,"The food was and is really good! I liked how they served the prata with the curry in a bucket! Really creative. Also, the restaurant was packed-indicating that the restaurant was popular for residents and other people. Food came just in time.

To summarize ,this is THE place to go!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104259317070181699836/reviews
