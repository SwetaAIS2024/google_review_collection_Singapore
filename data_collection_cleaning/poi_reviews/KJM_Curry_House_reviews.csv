G Saravana Govindasamy,2,Food is extremely oily and poor service. Have to ask multiple times to get something.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104082886299378395661/reviews
Athar,2,"Had lunch 3-4 times this week

Pros:
Only good option for non veg Indian food nearby
Niether costly nor cheap

Cons:
Staff is very rude, especially that fat male who give food
No service, no one listens to you, everybody busy in their own world even if not much customer.
Waiting time is more, sometime staff don't listen to you and payment machine is too slow.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106527462105899595390/reviews
elyca,5,"strongly recommended if you're searching for substantial, delectable, and satisfying Indian food in the Jurong East region. do try out their wonderful vadai paruppu, ordinary vadai, egg-masala thosai, and mixed rice with (chicken, gravy, & vegetables) if you're in town.

a significant drawback but also a crucial reminder that several of their menu itemsâ€”thosai, & etc are exclusively offered at night.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110871615036135126729/reviews
Euphorie Liew,3,"Came here around 10am for breakfast. Wanna order mee goreng or kothu prata but it was not available yet at this hour.

Therefore, I ordered one egg prata & one plain prata. They came in big pieces, and was served with 3 types of curries. Not very sure what curries are they, but not bad.

The pratas were freshly made at the kitchen before being served. You can feel that the prata was springy in ya mouth.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102306923068386332783/reviews
