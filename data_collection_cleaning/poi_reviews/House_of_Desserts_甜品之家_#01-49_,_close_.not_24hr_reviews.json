Like in the pictures but my ice melted. And she charged me $2.50 too. I asked why her ice kacang look difference, she claimed that she is typical malacca version, but she use only brown sugar (not gula malacca) and condense milk only. How to be malacca version? Please don’t get cheated by her.",

Will not patronize again.",
