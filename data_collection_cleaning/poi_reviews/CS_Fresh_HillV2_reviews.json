      "text": "The produce at CS Fresh is often on the verge of spoiling. I've frequently bought fruits that were rotten inside. Additionally, the meat prices are inflated, and they sometimes sell discounted raw meat that is already beginning to turn. I‚Äôve also noticed that products are often mislabeled; for example, an item marked at $6 could end up costing $12 at checkout due to incorrect pricing tags.\n\nIn comparison, Fair Price offers better quality produce and meat, typically at least $1 cheaper per item. On a positive note, I will say that the cooked meats and certain frozen meat items at CS Fresh are quite good.",

I like the ‚Äúreduced the clear‚Äù area - which has many good steals. Service is pretty average - and you‚Äôre much better off using the self check out counter.",
