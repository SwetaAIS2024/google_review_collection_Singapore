It was my first pregnancy abroad (moved from the states to Singapore) so it really helped a lot to have a doctor who was as wonderful as Dr. Choo.\n\nDr. Choo has great bedside manner and is very detailed, delightful to be with, attentive and genuinely cares for her patients.\n\nThe staffs are absolutely amazing! They are so funny (makes me look forward to the visits!), remembers you by names from day 1 and most importantly VERY responsive (via email, phone or in person) which I find are all so important when this is a 10 months journey to take together.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Choo and her staffs in a heartbeat.",
