      "text": "Well it arrived on time, but no other saving graces. That might’ve been our worst pizza experience. So bad we couldn’t stop laughing about it while eating. The biggest problem was the dough which was traumatizingly thick (we ordered the classic) and felt like eating bread and calories. Second, equally disturbing problem was the cheese. We understand processed cheese is inexpensive already, but they managed to find and use the most flavorless processed cheese. We ordered 2 pizzas and finished half the order before giving up. Serious improvement needed here and hope the business tests try their food to come to their own conclusion.\nAdded thought: the advert in YouTube did its job and one of the pizzas we ordered was the beef shawarma. In fact the pizza “looks” just like the video! but taste and texture fell way short.",

      "text": "We were one of the customers who ordered on 9 Aug and did not manage to get our pizzas that night and had to go to the store to cancel our order after waiting for 3+hours. Whilst there, we noticed that the staff were all not wearing gloves while preparing the food. Alas, since we received a voucher we decided to give them a chance again. But look at what we found in our pizza! Definitely not ordering from here anymore. Getting frozen pizzas from the supermarket would be a better choice. If we can give 0 stars, we would. We have also given our feedback via the feedback form, but here to raise awareness about their hygiene standards (or lack thereof).",
