Forest BK,5,"The Recycle Hill was formed from stacking up the recovered concrete slabs during the Bishan Park renovation work.

Adam Lee,5,"At the point when construction work of Bishan Park started to take shape  into a characteristic stream of natural waterway, the substantial concrete from the former Bishan channel was cut into slabs and piled up to form this Recycling Hill.

This is a deliberate effort to preserve some of the park's heritage; recycled and utilise specific materials in creative and meaningful ways.

On the highest point of the slope lies the widely praised sculpture “An Enclosure for a Swing” by Kelvin Lim Fun Kit. Roused by the mental protection one appreciates inside a swing, this iconic sculpture lends a shape to this intimate space.

The spatial extension and withdrawal shaped by the undulating steel strips follow out this movement to create a spatial cavity and a space that only Nature can enter. It is hoped that seating within the sculpture, one can share a rare intimacy with Nature.

Since it is set in a landscape which celebrates movement with its rolling hills and meandering waterways, this enclosure for a specific movement simultaneously partakes yet serves as an observatory as the river flows.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115680102960193169110/reviews
