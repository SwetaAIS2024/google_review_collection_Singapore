Stuart Glennie,5,"Popped in by after a medical appointment and was pleasantly surprised. Food was absolutely delicious- I had the big breakfast and my wife sampled the French toast. Both dishes were done to a very high standard and the taste and quality of the dish was remarkable.

The only downside for me (I’m a big guy) was the clustered seating arrangement made me a bit uncomfortable. The temperature of the dining area was also a tad on the warm side for me.

These two points made me go down to 4 stars on the atmosphere.

Drinks wise - the chai tea latte was by far the best we had ever sampled- ever. It was amazing.

It’s a bit out of the way for us- but will definitely try and come back.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102919358257213328315/reviews
ZiQi Hngoi,5,"This café is a cozy little spot with outdoor seating. Their coffee is aromatic and satisfying—my friends and I loved it. And don’t miss their rosti—it’s absolutely amazing! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and full of flavor. A hidden gem worth visiting!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110773269560162306396/reviews

Daph Ch,5,"Big breakfast is yummy! Added an additional sausage so the portion is good for 2 pax.

Highly recommended their Mocha and Flat White. Café ambience can be further improved with better air-conditioning.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105413318594060947509/reviews
Melany Sulaiman,5,"I accidentally came across this cafe when going to medical appointment.. and came back for a saturday brunch with my hubby. Positively surprised by the delicious food and coffee. The menu wasn’t extensive but the high quality ingredients and the way they’re prepared are enough to make us consider to be a regular to this small hidden cafe, as we live around the area. Oh by the way, the staff was nice.. he gave mini complimentary hot chocolate to small little girl sitting next to us.. that seems to make her day!!!

Keep up a good work!!

ps. This is not a “compensated” review. It is truly from the bottom of my heart saying that : it is GOOD.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112545153625231162148/reviews
