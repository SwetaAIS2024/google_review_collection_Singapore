Candice Ng,1,"I ordered a few items, including Butter Cream Cakes and Swiss Rolls, from this store (Punggol branch) through foodpanda today. They were very dry and I could taste that they were close to expired or even perhaps, already past their expiry dates.

The expiry date stickers on the boxes were deliberately torn off (I could still see a small bit of the sticker left on one of the Butter Cream Cake boxes), which I think is dishonest.

Please take extra care when purchasing from this store, especially if through a food delivery platform.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111680084877822069331/reviews

Tuty Amir,5,"Hard and Heart work
Miss Christine from Bread Junction (Punggol) attended to my order for CNY goodies professionally and efficiently. She went beyond her call of duty and followed through to ensure that order was delivered on time. I was very touched when she messaged me to check whether the goodies were delivered. I found her hard working and passionate in her work. Thanks so much Miss Christine. You will make a good manager!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107212679096764632921/reviews
