Happy Bird,5,"Another great dining experience at genki sushi. Sushi comes out quick and freshly made. The frequent special, unique offerings keep things fresh and interesting. Still a great fan of their bullet train delivery system, much better than the continuously moving train belt with sushi on display for who knows how long and handled by who knows who. Lovely outlet. Will definitely be back.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108716533290322327726/reviews

TTT,3,"We arrived at 6pm and didn’t have to wait long for a table. The service was efficient, and the staff quickly cleared our plates. However, the food today was somewhat disappointing. The sushi rice wasn’t packed tightly, causing it to crumble when picked up. Overall, a quick meal in the neighborhood.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117174446031825028588/reviews

Ed T,4,"Decent japanese foods that will satisfy your raw fish cravings.

It is what it is, reasonably priced sushi and sashimi.  Dont go comparing Genki with higher end places or even Japan.

I would come back, not because its the best, but because its decent and consistent.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118071263998897226945/reviews
