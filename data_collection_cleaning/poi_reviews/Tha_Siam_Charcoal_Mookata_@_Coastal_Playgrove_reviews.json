Unfortunately, pets are not allowed, which is a slight drawback for pet owners. Overall, it’s a great spot for a hearty meal!",

Excellent chilli sauces and soup! Great value and quality for price and portion. If you're small eaters, the 1-2 pax can feed 3 pax.",

Prices are reasonable with no service charge or GST. Being in East Coast “coffee shop” area it is breezy and has good casual ambience.\n\nService is excellent, friendly and efficient. We left a bag behind accidentally. The next time we came the owners remembered my family and gave it back to us!",

      "text": "I recently tried this Thai mookata place, and while it was overall okay, it wasn’t the best tasting mookata I’ve had. The portion sizes are generous, and I appreciated the neat and tidy presentation of everything. It’s clear they take care in the way they serve the food.\n\nOne big plus is the atmosphere—being located in East Coast Park, you can enjoy some nice sea breeze while dining, and there’s a convenient restroom nearby.\n\nHowever, a few things didn’t quite hit the mark for me. The sauce wasn’t to my liking, and the meat needs to be marinated longer to allow the flavors to infuse properly—it tasted a bit plain. The pork wasn’t as tender as I’d hoped, and there was only one soup option, which had a strong peppery taste that might not suit everyone.\n\nAll in all, it’s a decent option if you’re looking for a filling meal in a relaxing outdoor setting, but I wouldn’t say it’s the top choice for mookata.",
