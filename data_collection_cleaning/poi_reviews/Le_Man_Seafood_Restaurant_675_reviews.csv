Priscilla,5,"I usually buy from the other stalls but one day, my neighbor said this stall is nice and always crowded. One try and I‚Äôm hooked.
The staff were also super friendly and sometimes despite the queue, the waiting time is not very long.
I‚Äôve already patronised this stall 3 times this week. So yummy.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102313588109503070832/reviews
Gabriel Chew,5,Tried their curry fish head for the first time. Piping hot and Overall taste is good. Their ingredients quite generous as per pic. Fish no smelly smell.
