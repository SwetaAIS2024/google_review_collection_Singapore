      "text": "Decided to head down to CORNERSHOP as I am a matcha lover myself and I saw it on Tiktok and it caught my attention so I went down to try.\n\nFor drinks, I got the Ice Matcha Latte ($5.50 + $0.1 for takeaway). The matcha was traditional hand whisk with the cha sen and matcha bowl. The taste, astringency, and mouthfeels wise are okay to me as there are much better matcha places out there, but for the price point of $5.50, I felt it was good enough as it is in the hawker centre so no complains on that.\n\nThey do sell traditional nan yang coffee too from Yong Seng, a traditional nan yang coffee distributor in singapore. Will try it next time if I have the chance to.\n\n*Do note that if you are getting matcha tea/latte, you will have to wait as it is hand whisk and hand whisking takes some time, so please do not scold and be patient. If you are in a rush, I would suggest not getting it and going for coffee instead. (Coming from an F&B industry worker T_T)*",

      "text": "Do NOT go past this stall!!\n\nIt is wonderful to have this upmarket coffee option in this small established market at competitive prices (there are 3 traditional coffee operators here). â€˜Upmarketâ€™ as in the high standard of coffee and its variations, not in the physical brick-&-mortar sense of the word.\n\nNonetheless, the stallâ€™s small footprint is effectively optimised for easy workflow. Itâ€™s a very tidy, clean and hip operation ..I enjoyed the choice of music played at a very considerate volume so as not to disturb the neighbours.\n\nThe owner operator, Valerie, is a breath of fresh air.. with her soft spoken manner, cheerful disposition; she is very unassuming and approachable. Patiently she answered my numerous questions about the choice of beans she uses, the range of products etc.\n\nIâ€™ve only tried the kopi C, oat milk latte and the kopi cold brew on different visits. The coffee Valerie offers is very smooth, has good depth, strong enough without being too acidic or strong.\n\nHighly recommended; 5/5ðŸŒŸ",

I must say the drinks are better than some popular cafes out there ðŸ¥¹\n\nTotally understand the longer waiting time as the stall handler are only one person and I believe good things comes to people who can wait ðŸ¤­ do spare more time if you intend to visit the stall as it might take longer than usual beverage store, but trust me itâ€™s worth it!\n\nWill totally come again ðŸ©·",
