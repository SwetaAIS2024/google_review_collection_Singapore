Meilany Meilany,5,"We couldn't be happier with our son's experience at this daycare! Every day, he is so excited to go to school and meet his wonderful teachers and classmates. It’s amazing to see how much he has grown socially—he’s become so much more sociable and confident, and we have the school to thank for that!

This place is more than just a daycare. The teachers do an incredible job teaching him things I wouldn’t be able to at home, from creative activities to learning about different cultures. The teachers and principal are fantastic, and you can really see how much they care about the kids' development. Highly recommend!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118175005942723046771/reviews

Vera Ho,5,"Haven Infant & Toddler Centre at Tanjong Pagar is a hidden gem. Love that the teachers are sincere, they genuinely care for the children and one can sense the overall good vibes there. The teachers provide feedback and consistent updates which ensure we are kept-informed. my boy is happy going to school as seen from how he's all smiles during drop-offs almost every morning.
