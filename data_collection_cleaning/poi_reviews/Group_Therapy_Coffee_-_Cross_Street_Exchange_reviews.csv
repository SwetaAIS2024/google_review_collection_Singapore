Chim Mei,5,"We had a fantastic experience at The Group Therapy over the weekend. The service was truly top-notch—attentive, friendly, and accommodating. My husband avoids carbs, and unlike many cafés that stick rigidly to their menu, the staff kindly substituted his portion with another available ingredient without hesitation.

We ordered the Big Breakkie and Choose Your Own Bowl, both of which were fresh and well-prepared. The coffee, a latte and flat white, was smooth.

The atmosphere was relaxed and quiet, perfect for a leisurely weekend meal. With both indoor and outdoor seating, the space felt inviting without being overcrowded.

A standout café that combines great food, excellent coffee, and genuinely thoughtful service. Highly recommend for an stress-free, satisfying brunch!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101044726506569224192/reviews
Tony & Kim Outdoor Adventures,4,"We had an amazing brunch experience at Group Therapy Coffee – Cross Street Exchange! The café has a cozy, welcoming atmosphere, perfect for a relaxed meal.

We ordered the Açaí Bowl and the Full English Breakfast, and both were exceptional. The açaí bowl was beautifully presented, packed with fresh fruits, crunchy granola, and just the right level of sweetness—light yet satisfying. The full English breakfast was hearty and delicious, with perfectly cooked eggs, crispy bacon, juicy sausages, and all the classic elements done just right.

Beyond the fantastic food, the service was top-notch. The staff were efficient, friendly, and attentive, ensuring a smooth and pleasant dining experience.

If you're in the area and looking for a great spot for brunch, Group Therapy Coffee is a must-visit! We’ll definitely be back.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112823340865143525041/reviews
Sebastian,3,"We ordered egg benedict and a breakfast menu with pancakes, bratwurst sausage and bacon. The bread  below the egg benedict was far too hard. The bacon was a little too dry and too hard. All over all it was ok but not worth the price (except the coffee that was very delicious).",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102465028024288020501/reviews
Skye Cai,4,"Tried the beautiful pancakes.
Three layers of thick pancakes. Not that sweet but nothing special too.
The strawberries are not fresh.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Chris SG,5,"Superbly close to our gym and open early on weekends! Went on a Saturday with friends and the truffle pizza, along with the avocado chicken bowl was delicious and we shared this amongst 4 of us. Their 7 spiced chai latte is perfect to go with the food items. Highly recommended places",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118301042945741620173/reviews
