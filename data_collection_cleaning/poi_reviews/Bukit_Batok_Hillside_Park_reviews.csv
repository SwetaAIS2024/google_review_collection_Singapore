The Roaring Olympian 3Axle,3,"Visited in March 2024.

The abandoned park is fairly dangerous in certain areas, particularly the famed Torii boardwalk, which is a great way to cross from the human world to the land of the kami in a permanent way with a wrong step. Fallen trees have crushed the boardwalk and obstructed it at the same time, so a visitor cannot go to the other end of the park without exiting or navigating the steep slopes. I also saw bees as I was coming out, 20 or so, on an artificial rock near the stone step entrance.

The abandoned kampong plantation behind the Hillside park at BB West Ave 5 is much more interesting in my opinion. There was the ruins of what likely was the main house with a dried up well, a big circular open water tank and another rectangular water tank. The 2 water tanks were located behind the house where a small stream, likely a former longkang, supplied water to the circular water tank. This circular tank had 1 or 2 catfish inside, which may explain the clear water and relative lack of mosquitoes. Behind the circular tank is a rectangular water tank that likely used to rear fish, but has since cracked after being abandoned. It is very tranquil there, and is certainly worth a short visit, as it is not too difficult to reach.

Do be aware of wild boars and snakes, I was alerted by a pair of Bangladeshi workers that a snake dropped in front of me, which I failed to notice. They also mentioned seeing wild boars and their digging activities, so watch out. Oh, also got pandan growing there.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107084343119152421778/reviews
1Academy Science Howard,5,Both Hillside Park 1 and 2 are essential climate control mechanism which are highly beneficial to the health of residents within a 1km radius from its location. We must protect Hill 2 from being exploited by HDB (which it did to Hill 1). Hill 2 actually lowers the ambient temperature by up to 3 deg C across the Bukit Batok Polyclinic.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116826075189696725009/reviews
