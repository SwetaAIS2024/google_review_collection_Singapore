The ingredients and gravy were ready first while the bed Hoon was finally closer to 7.15 am and sales started. I waited till 7.30 am for the noodle to be ready as I preferred a mix of bee hoon mee. Credit must be given for the teamwork during the preparations & the quick time they got their act together to serve the simple but delicious vegetarian bee hoon mee.",
