Recommended to come here if you would like to have nice fried loklok that is still crispy even when you bring home. Have a try!",

The shop was clean and one could actually sit outside the shop around the parking lot area but of course, no air conditioning. But considering night time, it was doable.\n\nI saw reviews saying that there’s this $1 lok lok which I didn’t see so i picked some items from the fridge but they were priced higher.\n\nThe fried items were overdone and very oily in my opinion. Some of them were dry and corners were charred, hence had a bitter taste to it.",

There is the option of boiling your items by yourself in a steaming pot of water instead of getting it fried.\n\nThe drinks here are ironically the most expensive part of the meal. One bottled drink set us back around 5RM, which is essentially 5 sticks.\n\nDo drop by if you're in the area.",

Love it they have expanded and increased their menu option with rice and noodles so that the kids can have a substantial meal in additional to the wide loklok variety available.\n\nThe fried items are done really well with no strong stale oil smell and not oozing with oil.\n\nThe chilli is super spicy, chilli lovers are in for a treat.\n\nPrice is reasonable at 1RM/stick with the exception of certain items that have their pricing labeled.\n\nService is quick and open air parking available all around.",
