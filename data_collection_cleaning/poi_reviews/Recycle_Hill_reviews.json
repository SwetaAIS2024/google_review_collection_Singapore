      "text": "At the point when construction work of Bishan Park started to take shape  into a characteristic stream of natural waterway, the substantial concrete from the former Bishan channel was cut into slabs and piled up to form this Recycling Hill.\n\nThis is a deliberate effort to preserve some of the park's heritage; recycled and utilise specific materials in creative and meaningful ways.\n\nOn the highest point of the slope lies the widely praised sculpture “An Enclosure for a Swing” by Kelvin Lim Fun Kit. Roused by the mental protection one appreciates inside a swing, this iconic sculpture lends a shape to this intimate space.\n\nThe spatial extension and withdrawal shaped by the undulating steel strips follow out this movement to create a spatial cavity and a space that only Nature can enter. It is hoped that seating within the sculpture, one can share a rare intimacy with Nature.\n\nSince it is set in a landscape which celebrates movement with its rolling hills and meandering waterways, this enclosure for a specific movement simultaneously partakes yet serves as an observatory as the river flows.",
