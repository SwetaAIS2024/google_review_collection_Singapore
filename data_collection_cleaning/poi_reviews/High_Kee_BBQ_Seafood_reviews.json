Please lets make this hawker store close down because they give all Singaporean hawkers a bad reputation.\n\nPortions are so small its pathetic for the price.\n\nBeef Fried Rice ($8)\n- No beef slices at all. Just rice and egg.\n- Meant for 2 people. But the entire box can only have 5 tablespoons.\n\nOyster Kailan ($8)\n- Not even a 1/5th of the container filled. Looks like leftover food.\n\nGung Gung ($12)\n- $12 for twelve pieces. Wow....more expensive than a five star seafood restaurant.\n\nI have grown up eating at lagoon for more than 30 years. This store needs to shut. Avoid please.",

The petai was fine but nothing to write home about. I would not recommend this store, there are many other stores nearby selling the same things.",

Wouldnt trust the recent barrage of 5 star reviews as its not the best zi char stall ive tried. It doesnt even beat average stingrays ive tried.",
