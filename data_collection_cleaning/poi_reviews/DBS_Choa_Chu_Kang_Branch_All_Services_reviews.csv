J F,1,"I am deeply disappointed with the service I received. My sole intention was to speak to a bank teller in person, yet the support staff insisted I use a video teller instead. I traveled all the way here specifically to meet a human teller because the staff at the Bangkit branch previously informed me that I needed an ATM card, which I do not possess. When I called the hotline, I was advised to visit the counter directly, but upon arriving here, I was told to schedule an appointment.

Please work on bringing human back to neighbourhood branch so I do not have to spent money to travel to another place to get rejected.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112064400985694162380/reviews
AK L,5,"Whatever previous customers experience the longer waiting time, was due to the Cny festive period and the new notes exchange. Fast forwarding currently after festive season, the queue is not heavy. Thus depending on when you came down, I did the transactions in less than 10mins. So people, be appreciative",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114107946594993515493/reviews
Syah,1,"Bad service. Visited the bank today morning to open a joint account. A staff there mentioned that we do not need to go to the branch to open the account and can do it online. When we reached home and tried to apply online, only opening of joint-alternate account option given. No joint-all account option. Asked chatGPT and they mentioned to visit the bank branch to open a joint-all account. So what now??? Wasted my leave just for all this shit and ended up not opening any joint account at all. I will go for other banks instead.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103308193541667655544/reviews
Far 26,5,"I just went down to the choa chu kang branch today, and reading the previous bad reviews, i was a bit expecting to get bad and slow service. I came from bukit panjang branch an hour ago before heading to cck cause what i needed wasn’t available there since that branch doesn’t have any over the counter service/ printing what i needed. I rushed to the cck branch and expected to wait like 30 mins-1 hour. When i arrived, your employee Seow woah yun, attended to me and she knew what i needed based on my explanation and she printed and gave me what i need, all in less than 5 mins. I would recommend going to this branch with the good customer service i have experienced :) thank you so much!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100912915230194930044/reviews
c c,5,"I visited the branch today to enquire about foreign a/c services and the branch staff who’s helming the entrance to the bank was extremely helpful in responding to my questions. I truly appreciate her help, and I’m sure many others, too, so that they wouldn’t have to wait in the queue to speak to the counter staff. Thank you :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108319029397793233252/reviews
