Seow Hsiung Ong,5,"Watched CNA's documentary on Crest Secondary School. These students are not bad, they just need time and many encouraging words to motivate them. Whether they can understand or not, we need to have more patience in them and understand why they cannot make it in their selected choice.

The teachers are doing their best to help and guide. I hope everyone can enjoy their time and achieve their goals.

Whole crowd was queuing in an orderly manner for the train and this lower sec boy from this school just came and cut queue and boarded the train, not even caring about the elderlies in the queue",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105955108113900309674/reviews
