      "text": "My daughter is learning the violin from Ms. Narin and has been taking lessons for about three months. She finds it incredibly fun and enjoyable. Before enrolling in this academy, I inquired about private lessons and various other academies. What I was looking for was a teacher with professional experience in violin performance. Ms. Narin seemed like the best choice, and after the trial lesson, we made the decision right away.\n\nShe is guiding my daughter, who is still in the early stages, with proper posture and accurate playing techniques while leading her with charisma. At the same time, she explains things kindly, which motivates my daughter to continue learning the violin.\n\nAdditionally, the manager who greets us warmly every time we walk in is always so kind and welcoming. Thank you for your continued support!",

She combines rigorous musical education with a solid foundation in music theory, following the ABRSM syllabus closely.
