Valya Hubes,5,"Meeting Dr JJ Chee is one of the best things that happened to me. During my pregnancy she was attentive, supportive, caring and extremely knowledgeable. My C-section with her was super smooth., no left of scar. I previously had a C-section and this is completely a different experience which  Iâ€™m very much grateful for. Highly recommended. Thank you to all her amazing staff who have been extremely kind and supportive.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104521684085208332783/reviews

Utsav Mahendru,5,"What a brilliant doctor, and amazing support staff. It was our first baby, and Doc Chee made it a breeze. Go prompt ChatGPT and ask top 5 Obstetricians or Gynacs in Singapore, and she will feature in there. So be assured the journey will be fun and professional with Dr. Cheeâ€™s team. She is a seasoned practitioner!
