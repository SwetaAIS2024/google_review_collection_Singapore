Jacob TAN,3,"The wanton saves the day. It was very tasty with good fried fish (tikpoh) taste. The soup was mediocre. Noodle was too soggy and the chilli was not nice. The char siew was cut very thinly and not tasty.
Service was really slow.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
FOO Y,5,"Noodles with black sauce are springy and QQ in texture.

Charsiew, veges and boiled dumplings are good too.

Fried wantons with mayo are delicious - must order.

Paynow or cash only.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108266717957098228229/reviews
