      "text": "Was there for takeaway Laksa and  Prawn mee on a Saturday morning, was informed that Mee Siam was no longer available. Both takeaway order costs SGD 3.50 The noodles and broth / soup for the Laksa and Prawn mee was packed separately.  On dishing our both takeaways for consumption, it was found that the prawn mee soup and Laksa broth given were so little (amounting to half a bowl) that it could not sufficiently cover the noodles for both orders. (IS THIS THE NORM FOR TAKEAWAY ORDERS OR AN HONEST MISTAKE?).\nPrawn mee consisted of two halves of a prawn (sliced lengthwise), a few pieces of sliced pork and fish cakes and a few strands of kankong.\nLaksa consisted of half a prawn (sliced lengthwise), a few slices of fish cakes and a few cubes of dried bean curd. Taste wise for both dishes were very underwhelming and over rated considering the stall's past reviews. Highly disappointing.",

NOT WORTH THE HYPE AND QUEUE. Taste so so and gravy abit thin (mom agreed standard has dropped too). Laksa gravy also on the sweet side. There is always a long queue probably because it is one of the cheapest laksa around.",
