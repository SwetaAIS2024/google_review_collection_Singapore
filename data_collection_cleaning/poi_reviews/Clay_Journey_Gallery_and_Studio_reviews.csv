Max Worsley,5,"Me and two friends did a 2.5hr workshop at Steven‚Äôs wonderful studio. Steven is a master artist and so passionate about his work. He is incredibly knowledgeable and creative and the workshop was great fun.
Steven showed us how to both hand build and throw, before we had plenty of time to try it for ourselves and make 2-3 pieces each. Steven also shared his story about how he got into ceramics, and kindly gave us some of his delicious homemade tea to keep us hydrated!
Steven offers both short classes (2.5hrs) as an introduction, as well as courses that range from 4 weeks (1 day a week) to longer options and master classes.
The studio is easily accessible via Bugis MRT and bus links.
Would highly recommend!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118018305416429769968/reviews
