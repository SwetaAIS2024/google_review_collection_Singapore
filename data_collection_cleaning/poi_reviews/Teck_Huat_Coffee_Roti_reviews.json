When I brought my own flask and told her to put the coffee in there, she raised her voice and asked me to repeat my order 3 times.\nEven my mum asked me if it was the same lady with a bad temper.\nThe taste of the coffee is greatly influenced by the temperament of the one who pours the coffee. And my coffee tasted bitter this morning.\nI hope that Teck Huat management will teach her anger management.",
