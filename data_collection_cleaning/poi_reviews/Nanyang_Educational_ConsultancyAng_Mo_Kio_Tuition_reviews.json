I have joined Nanyang Educational Consultancy a little late as preparations for my N-Levels, however, with their help, I managed to go from just passing my subjects, to scoring grade 1s and 2s. With the release of N-Levels results, I am now applicable to go PFP which is a great accomplishment that I never knew I could achieve. All of this was thanks to Nanyang Educational Consultancy.",

When he was unable to attend some lessons, the staff was also very helpful to adjust to a favourable timing. Fast forward to today, he is awarded the Edusave scholarship for the top 10% within his level. A big thanks to his tutors Louis and Ben!",
