Eggs is via hot water. Need to estimate the time (auntie mentioned 7 mins, but think its closer to 8 mins).\n\nOverall good food at good value.",

      "text": "Used to drive to Westgate to get my fix of teh and eggs at Toast Box or Yakun. But no more after discovering this little gem at a corner of Taman Jurong market.\nTeh is creamy and just sweet enough. Not too sweet or bland like what you get in many places.\nEggs come in hot water, allowing you to choose how long you want them to he cooked. My usual is 8 minutes. Other places may be less messy, but leaves you little choice in how runny you want your eggs to be.\nI normally eat peanut toast. Toasty and fragrant, but not super thick like Toastbox. Not complaining, as eggs and teh are deal breakers for me.\nBest of all, it's only $2.60. I eat so often the auntie recognizes me.",
