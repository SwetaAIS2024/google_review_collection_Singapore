      "text": "We have been dropping by Mohamed Javed Indian Muslim Food for the past few years now, and in my opinion this is one of the most underrated roti prata in the Anchorvale / Fernvale region. In fact, it is even better than the roti prata shops at Jalan Kayu which is nearby.\n\nAnd why is it good? It‚Äôs crispy on the outside (but not to the extent of eating biscuits that kind of crispy), and soft on the inside. Prata is also done to perfection with very minimal burned areas which is good. It is also pan-fried on the spot unlike other shops that are prepared beforehand. This also means that waiting time is about 20mins.\n\nYou can select beef or fish curry, but our personal preference is beef curry because it‚Äôs more fragrant.",

The pratas had a faint, fragrant smell and were a mix of doughy and crispy. The curry was thick, which I liked. Until I find better, this will be my go-to prata stall in Sengkang and Punggol.",

Yet it didn't have a lighter texture!?\n\nAnd the fish curry lacked the requisite oomph, though it's less salty than what I will get at Buangkok hawker centre!\n\nAt this rate, this can't be the \"best in Sengkang\" I reckon ü§î\n\nIncidentally, #MHTamChiak has read about a certain prata stall in the West -- is it at Teban Gardens or something? -- which serves mutton curry by default.\n\nAnd they are usually sold out like before 10am since they open very early for business and is rather popular.\n\nI really wonder if waking up extremely early and making a 1 hour 45 min journey there is worth the trouble... Or could I be missing out on something great? üòÉ\n\nYa, have good food will travel! üòÅ\n\n#Relegated",

The egg onion prata was great, nice contrast and crunchy to the soft dough.\nMixed with the 2 different curries given, nice little explosion of flavors.\n\nOverall can eat, recommended to come earlier to avoid the long queue and crowds.",
