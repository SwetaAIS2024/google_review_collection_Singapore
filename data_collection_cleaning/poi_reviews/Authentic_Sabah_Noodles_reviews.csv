Ivan Lam TY,5,"Weekday morning about 9:30am here for my breakfast. Finally, looking for so long an authentic Sabah noodle has opened coffeeshop stall at Vertex, Ubi.
I have ordered Sabah Meat Noodle Dry, the taste is good and authentic. Just because Singapore yellow mee is not that tasty as Sabah local mee. The black sauce is so fragrance with fried shallot oil. I like the noodle portion is big. The soup is nice, it comes with slice pork meat, pork ball and veggies. For sure I will return again.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118349078308008334130/reviews
W Y,5,"Stall-owner related to me that today (26 Sep 2024) is the last day of operations; unsure of whether he will be opening a stall elsewhere.

Unique noodles at affordable price ($5), though not sure if it‚Äôs the authentic Sabah taste üòÇ

The Kampua noodles has minced pork and pork lard inside and served with meatball soup. Prawn noodles is good too.

A pity that I only got to eat this twice before it closes.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101522161375913093051/reviews
Melvin J.,5,"Ordered the Sang Nyuk Mian for $5 and it hit the spot. The noodles come with dark soy sauce, shallots, and pork oil, and you need to toss them yourself. The soup was flavourful, with tender pork slices and meatballs.

The yellow noodles are not the same as what you get in Sabah because they taste different here. Still, it was a great meal and as close to the real deal as you can get!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110204106470894976302/reviews
Tatiana Bell,5,"If you‚Äôre very hungry and craving a generous portion of noodles, this is the place for you. I always order the ÁîüËÇâÈù¢, and the noodles always almost overflow the bowl. The handsome cook ensures you have a satisfying and filling lunch before heading back to work.
