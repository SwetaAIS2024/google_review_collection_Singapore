Cheers T4 at Changi Airport is a convenient 24-hour convenience store catering to travelers and airport staff. It offers a good selection of snacks, beverages, travel essentials, and basic groceries. The store is well-stocked and efficiently run, making it a reliable stop for last-minute needs. However, prices can be slightly higher than regular stores, which is expected at an airport. Overall, it's a handy spot for quick purchases before a flight.

Thank you, and God Bless",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110561422577939376703/reviews
Jon L,4,"Cheers is a convenience store located in the Terminal 4 Arrival Hall at Changi Airport near the baggage claim area. Needed to exchange some large bills that I got from the ATM for smaller ones, so I opted to buy a drink here. There is a large selection of canned and bottled drinks to choose from, as well as an extensive snack selection. The size of the store was surprisingly big as there were a lot of products to choose from. If you are a quick nibble or drink, this store is well-equipped to fill your needs.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105877892124929952379/reviews

Mr. Li (Êùé‰∏≠Âπ≥),4,"Years ago I landed in either T1 and T2, now they have T3 and T4. You wont get lost here, just read and follow the directions. Immigration gates are now automated with I'm Officers ready to assist you along the way, physical booths are still apparent yet kiosk are more now. You wont get a stamp you arrived (or left) in SGN, you will get an email notification. A link to the other terminals is located at the far side on the right once you get out of immigration. Before that you will see a lit of kiosk providing sim cards. For now it has a big cardboard pop up of the monopoly man. As always, Changi has set the standard of what a clean and modern airport is. Glad to have flown here again. #RP",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109712642686684269540/reviews
