Ee Min Lui,5,"My usual haunt, with joyful service by the Tachinomiya team. Love the agedashi tofu with its heartwarming ginger notes in the dashi. Hope this will return to the menu ðŸ˜‹ (pic shows new dish age tofu with teriyaki sauce)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102095126917312629962/reviews

Oiishi desu ne! Love the freshness of the ingredients, the smokiness and juiciness of the ribeye. Must try the chicken karaage with special sauce!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118070979409825808801/reviews
James Chia,3,"Came here cause it seems quite interesting. Food was ok for the price. Service was bad. I came they asked if I had reservation, I said no and they seem to ignore me until I asked where I could sit for drinks. Then they directed me to a high table. The sake was pleasant the food was alright but the tower of asahi was flat. Probably wouldn't come again.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101246479802310908684/reviews
Jenique K,4,"This gem is situated in Koven, and I love how this neighbourhood has quite a few interesting food places, including this cozy izakaya and bar! I love the vibes of this place, been here before, though previously it was for drinks and their salmon sashimi which I find is very reasonably priced, and served in relatively thick slices too! This time round, we were here for dinner and so I ordered a rice bowl with some sides and drinks.

Salmon Chirashi Bowl + Miso Soup ($16)
My first time trying their rice bowl. This was substantial (for me), with rather generous portions of salmon and ebiko. Overall, a decent meal!

Miyakanbai Ichigo Strawberry (on the rocks) ($12)
I've had this before and I fell in love with it, so I'm so glad to have it again! This was so refreshing, sweet and sour, and easy to drink. Really can't taste the alcohol taste (to me), and I love the fruity taste so much!

Cheese Mentaiko Scallop ($6.80 per piece)
This was some cheesy goodness, and the scallop was big and rather juicy too. Enjoyed this!

Shishamo Karaage ($6.50 for 4 pieces)
Crisp, and warm. I love this. Really a treat for people who love fish roe, I feel? Adding a touch of lemon made it less jelat and lighter.

Overall I love this place, it is really cozy, and I find it nice to  chill and catch up with friends, especially after a long week! The staff are friendly too! Please note though, that it is best to book in advance as the place is rather small and so it might be rather challenging to get a place if you walk in and it happens to be fully booked!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112596306061943039435/reviews
Lorelai D,3,"Random find as we were thinking of just having a random walk at Kovan to find food, we were supposed to go to Claypot valley but ended up at Tachinomiya. Translated it means standing drinking bar in Japanese.

There were already a few groups there while we visited, having some merry drinking sessions, alcohol wise, it was priced quite okay compare to other restaurants.

Food wise, we ordered a skewer of bacon wrapped with asparagus, we didnâ€™t really enjoy that too much because it was really tiny so lack of the asparagus taste in it.

The salmon chirashi don was okay for us, generous amount of salmon and tobiko, but it comes with some salad greens in it, so I was not really used to it.

My makan partner had the hamburger curry rice, I thought the hamburger serving was much smaller than other restaurant, but given the price we paid, I do thing at neighbourhood price, it is still a place worth going if you want to have a Japanese food fix that is above hawker or food court standard.

Tom Pallette ice cream is just a few steps down which I did a review on, that one is a must try.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110563036404967613068/reviews
