Angie,5,Fantastic live band music - creating a great relaxing atmosphere. You can also dedicate songs - the duet very good-naturedly entertained our song requests. Korean pancake is crispy and nice and army stew is also good. A gem in Punggol. Highly recommended!,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113524895917375971246/reviews

Patrina Wong,2,"Went in a group of 4 and seated at the patio tall table overlooking the park and sea. Thumbs up for the ambience but unfortunately the food and staff are a disappointment.

We ordered some skewers, asking for 2-pax portion. Thought of sharing so we can order more food variety. Ordered some wine and other drinks. Waiter came back later on to say the skewers seem not enough, urge that we order more. We didn't really probe as were busy in a conversation. Turned out the skewers were over ordered. Not a big deal though but felt kinda ripped off.

Ordered oysters but no house white wine to go with. Fine, red wine will do but they ran out after 1 glass. Ordered fried squid, tough and over-fried.

There's an attached toilet in this place but it's very disgusting.

Overall I didn't enjoy my visit. Probably it will appeal more to beer drinkers cause beer selection seems quite ok with promotions.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105836076151771532121/reviews
