Wendy,5,"Art Vision has a nurturing environment with friendly and skilful teachers who are good at handling children while developing their art skills. I observed that these factors make children very comfortable learning art there. My eldest daughter learnt art techniques from the teachers and was able to use colours confidently to express her drawings. When the opportunity arises, the teachers also encourage their students to join art competitions and I find that it really gives the child a valuable experience drawing outside plus, it also boosts the childâ€™s self-confidence when their art work is recognised by the judges. Due to her schedule, she has stopped attending art classes but once in awhile, she still goes back to join their holiday programmes. Now that my younger daughter is of age to join an art class, I do not need to think twice and chose to enrol her at Art Vision since I had seen its benefits for my eldest daughter. :)

Lee Chen Chong,5,"""All my 4 children attended art class by Art Vision. They are aged 22, 19, 16 & 8. Now my youngest one is taking the weekly art class and looks forward to it.
AV has very wonderful art teachers who are not only passionate about art but also teach my children important core values like respect, patience and good mannerism etc. They walk the talk and are very down to earth. Am grateful that my children were taught by them when young and in the process they enjoyed themselves and also developed a flair for details and imagination and learn to appreciate the beauty around them.
