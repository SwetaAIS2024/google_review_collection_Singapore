Randy Lim,3,"Nice place. One big peeve, the smokers at the outside corner is almost non-stop. Can smell the cigarette smoke almost the entire day. Different people come and chain-smoke at both corners, customers, stall helpers and building staff.

Hope they can enforce the non-smoking area to protect the health of non-smokers.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113180855409898455055/reviews
Paul Schneider,5,What a little gem this joint is! Stumbled across this place as I was out riding with friends and a mate got a flat.. so decided to makan while we repaired the tyre at the bike place not far from here.. it was an hour away from closing time and the fella only had western food available. The food was great and the owner a great host to us.. prepared what he had and it was a good feed. The local fare on the menu looked like good options too.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109773961324132998760/reviews
