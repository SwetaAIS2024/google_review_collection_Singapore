Khnat Naing Thway,1,"The worst! Literally! Haven’t been to at pharmacy like this in my whole life. The wait it TOOO long. If you have an appointment at this hospital and god forbid have a new medicine prescribed to you, get ready to spend the whole day at the hospital. Won’t have anytime to do anything that day.

Luckily they have a delivery system to get your medication replenish, but it doesn’t work if you get prescribe a new medication.

The wait at the pharmacy is the worst! At a LEAST 2 hour wait. Have to wait an hour just to get registered and an additional hour to get your medications.

WOW just wow. They really need to improvise their system.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113938654063374400177/reviews
Steven Lim,1,"time to collect medicine needs so long, better use of time. Pls improve the pharmacy workflow to improve productivity which they been advocating. I don’t have good suggestion but I sure there is always solutions to all problems. Saw few robot arms behind the counters, are these installed for some time already but why they are not used?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108266948693022457500/reviews
Anna Cheng,1,"The collection of the medicine at B2 pharmacy is horrible. Everytime have towait at least one & half hour. Even after taking the queue number, i went to see doctor, after more than 1hr plus, go to the miss queue counter, still have to wait at least 8 person, i really feel frustrated about how TTSH management handle the pharmacy for inefficiency, i understand there are a lot of people collecting medicine, but i can say TTSH is the worst hospital for collecting medication.
I did see a few counter is empty, since the crowd are so overwhelming, why they don't open more counter and let the patient wait shorter. As i am now in the pharmacy, what i see & write is true, no making up story. If today my medicine not urgent, i will ask for delivery, where got time to waste on this kind of poor management.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102409462319525749159/reviews
Rina Li,1,"Wish I saw the review page sooner.  Waited 1 hour plus and still no medication.  The numbers are jumbled up badly, you’re constantly staring at the screen and at a variety of letters and numbers popping up randomly.  I see old folks weary of waiting, tired and even dozing off.  What an absolute waste of time, no improvement to their service and processes after all these years!  Please opt for home delivery!!!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112781909227151841549/reviews
henry hee,1,Waiting time is too long. Everytime I waited more than an hour. This result in a large crowd waiting for their medicine. Virus may easily spread. Another point the patient to go for drink or food because of long queue. This result in a lot of mis-queue and increase the congestion even more. Hope the hospital will improve this situation.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111493242508380634930/reviews
