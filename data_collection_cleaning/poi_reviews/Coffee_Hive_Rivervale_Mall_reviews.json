The orh nee portion was super pathetic. Super not worth.\n\nFor cheese fries, mayo was more than cheese too.. but I would say their serving speed was quite ok. Also when my child spilled milo, they didn’t give me black face and clean it up speedily.\n\nIf I come again for other food, will redo the stars to be fair for them. Take it as a pinch of salt because I’m only having limited dish this round.",

Service is efficient and seats are plentiful for small groups.\n\nBetter dishes are the laksa, black pepper chicken and curry chicken. Toast set is fairly good, if you just want to fill your belly. Gravy is thick enough for the reasonable price. The macaroni chicken, pumpkin noodle soup and horfun were underwhelming and plain (but ok for young children).",

      "text": "Very bad experience at the Coffee Hive Rivervale Branch . Felt scammed , Was charged full amount despite there is balance amount in my coffee hive app . Was asked to top up to my app in order to use my app balance . But yet after I pay wave for the intended top up of $20 to my loyalty app  ,  i found that they charged me $20.40 instead with no 10% cashback credited per the loyalty program claims! They also did not deduct the existing balance from my app and just charge full price on my meal. Then What’s the point for having the loyalty program ?? and when  I said I want to top up and use my existing balance???!!! One Chinese and One foreign female counter staff insist rudely that nothing can be done . Very dishonest , irresponsible and rude behaviours !! Totally felt that their loyalty program and staff are a total scam  !",
