      "text": "I absolutely loved my experience at #3 Cafe Bar! The vibe is perfect—cozy yet trendy, with great music and stylish decor. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure everything was just right. Hardly you will see the boss cooking and watering but this one such exception. Dashing out of the kitchen to serve the diners, he has all my respect.\n\nThe food and drinks were outstanding albeit slightly towards the salty side. The menu offers a delicious mix of fresh, high-quality ingredients, and everything I tried was flavorful and beautifully presented.",

The food presentation was impressive, and while some dishes didn’t quite suit our taste buds, we might have just ordered the wrong ones. The pork risotto was the standout dish, rich and flavorful, while the Yuzu drinks were refreshing. We may return to explore more of the menu.",

Used a couple of serviettes to remove the oil but it was still wayyyy too oily as u can see from the picture. Didn't finish it in the end. Hope they can work on it",
