      "text": "To Qiji Management, I visited your outlet at kinex mall on the 4th March at around 2030hrs , no customer is around except me and I first thought your outlet is already closed until I saw the operating hour is until 2100 as nobody is manning at the cashier , it is until I hear someone giggling and talking below the cashier counter. I walk further and found out your staff is actually squatting below chit chatting, Well I bear with it since it's only a small delay and no other customers is around at that point. What really bother me is that the cashier guy with specs did not give out any que numbers and I thought since im the only one one in the stall , he could have call out to me when my order is ready, rather he press the counter number 3 times, first I looked at him and he is looking at someone else, I thought someone before me already order , that's why I didn't reacts to it, then again he press the bell assuming I know that was my order, again I thought it's could be someone else order, he did not call out to me still, Untill finally the 3rd time no one collect the order, he look at my direction without speaking a word that only then I realized it could be my order. I have to ask him if this is my order only then he gesture to me that is my order. Is it so difficult to call out to me since I'm only next to the counter, or he can simply show some hand signal to let me know my order is ready. I'm rather perplexed how this chap show no sense of courtesy to inform the patron let me waiting for no reason. Service level is definitely way below par!",
