Ram Kyi,4,Excellent Mandarin and Canto songs. Singers were good and so was the keyboardist. Song requests are taken and the singers give it their best to do even the toughest of vocals. Its definitely one of the more enjoyable evenings listening to live music with a beer in hand.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118380789608572815835/reviews

Sau Bing Wong,1,"Service is bad. There is about 10 of us. We ordered 2 bottles of whisky. We have to pour the whisky ourselves all the time. The young waiters and waitresses are busy playing with their mobile phones and every time we need anything we need to ask them to come over. They did not even put coasters on our glasses. I think the management need to give some training to them. In the end, we have to bring one bottle of whisky back after spending less than 2 hours there. However, the live band is good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106669483823652233658/reviews
