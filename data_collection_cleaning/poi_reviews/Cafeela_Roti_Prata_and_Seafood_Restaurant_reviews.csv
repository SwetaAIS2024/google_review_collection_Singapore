Jo Jo,1,Very packed with people so itâ€™s understandable service suffered a little. But the food taste-wise is not really good. The mee goreng still has the strong alkaline noodle taste and the plain prata is not really plain but very oily and with a sweet glaze. At least the chicken briyani is not bad.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104084157113994731726/reviews

Angel Tee,1,"donâ€™t bother coming if you crave for prata, just go springleaf outlet or any other prata shop. Their prata is not even crispy but super doughy. One mushroom cheese prata $5.50ðŸ˜‚  Serve me wrong maggi goreng but keep insist that i should take the wrong order maggi goreng",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114288639982512678536/reviews
Mark Heng (Infosphere),3,"Can't believe their prata has gone sub-standard!

Plain one was tough. Egg one didn't fare better -- you'd expect the egg to moisten the texture; but no, it was like an overnight piece!

At much higher price points of $1.70 and $2.70 respectively, there's better value to be found elsewhere (fortunately :)

The only saving grace is perhaps the teh tarik... and the consistently spicy curry lol.

Somehow, Jln Kayu has lost its shine as the preferred prata place; sadly :(

(Still, I remain hopeful that things will turn around... While I seek out other places to makan...)
