Violet Yap,1,"Attended Mount Horeb for a year and felt total betrayal of not being invited or introduced by the Pastor to my age appropriate cell groups. He asked me what I mean by ""younger"" group and the reason why I was not introduced is because he don't know which day I'm free. Talked to the only auntie that I trust she said the young adults cell groups do not invite anybody to their groups, this is true because I know some of them for a year and none of them invited me. Totally felt oust and not Welcome. I shall not attend anymore!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117917316294474655109/reviews
