Zee AN,5,"We’ve had such positive experiences at IMC Katong! Every doctor we’ve seen has been incredibly helpful, thorough, and professional. It’s clear they genuinely care about their patients and take the time to listen and provide thoughtful advice. We’ve consulted with all the doctors, and each one has been excellent, offering consistent, high-quality care.
The nursing team deserves special mention as well—they are friendly, attentive, and always go the extra mile to ensure patients feel comfortable and well cared for. The clinic is well-organized, and appointments run smoothly from start to finish. Highly recommend this clinic for anyone looking for compassionate and reliable medical care.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103731483190339543990/reviews

Bruno Franco Paez Fallone,5,"I was diagnosed with Dengue Fever, and continued my treatment at the clinic.
Dr Vino and all the medical staff were very kind, considerate and helpful.
I was very far from my home country, and they made me transit the virus in a safe way.
Highly recommended clinic!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115898596375982245012/reviews
A Z,5,"Best clinic experience in singapore (we've been to at least 10-20). Doctor Maria was very attentive to details and asked my opinion on prescription after explaining options (some other clinics like to give as much medicine as possible).  Online booking is efficient (you do get the timing you booked, doctor apologized for just 10 mins delay). Medicines are packed in a paper bag not a plastic bag which is so overly used in Singapore.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102857598683050023813/reviews
Enzo Fornaro,1,"Extremely expensive and unfriendly. They r required by law to take patient’s data but they charge 30 sgd as ‘registration’ fee. I went for travel advisory i was seen by a new doctor who didn’t visit me, didn’t check my health records nor prior vaccination, she said you do like ur wife and charged us double price because it was 2 of us in the room… good i left kids at home, she would have charged for them too. Never again!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112023413094324156997/reviews
