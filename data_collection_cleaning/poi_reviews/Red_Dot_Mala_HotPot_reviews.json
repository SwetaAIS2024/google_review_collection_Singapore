I came back today and the same tea was priced at $10 at checkout without any prior notice. After asking, I was informed by the female boss that \"the price will increase starting today.\" This kind of practice without clearly marking the price or explaining it in advance is disappointing.\nIt‚Äôs important to operate with integrity. It‚Äôs hard to look back this way.\n\nWe came here last week and ordered a pot of Chinese tea. The menu didn‚Äôt show the price, but it was always charged at $3, clearly stated on the receipt. Today, we ordered the same tea, and was shocked to see it charged at $10 without any prior notice. When we asked, the owner simply said the price changed ‚Äútoday.‚Äù This kind of pricing without transparency is very disappointing. Honest business practices matter, and sadly, we won‚Äôt be coming backüëéüèª",
