K,5,"Absolutely love the dishes that I ordered. Not sure of the low ratings, maybe those are just occasional bad days. Some food is similar to the adjacent store (Le Tian Tian). Service is fast.

Here is what I recommend:
1) Black Vinegar pork (thick gravy, premium sauce)
2) Curry Chee Cheong Fun (comes with fish roll and crispy tau kee)
3) Curry chicken with toast (home style rich curry, not too spicy)

Kopi O kosong is nice too.

Serving is just nice for the price.

Would return again to try other dishes.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109386738253826668143/reviews
Hailey Lin XN,1,Portion is ridiculously small for $4.20 of Chee Chong fun and yam cake (it Is pathetically thin slice). Do not come here! Itâ€™s better to go eat duck rice in b1 level.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101793768140194461620/reviews
Mao,3,"love old school breakfast shops so 4 stars for the atmosphere. service quite fast and staff was ok.

the food is abit pricey and quite average. only dish i love is their scrambled eggs which was freshly cooked! $3 for 3 eggs i think quite ok.

their kopi and tea are also soso.

will try their toast and maybe curry next time!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103838334123409426621/reviews
Jiak Pa Liao,1,"We were drawn in by the bustling crowd at this cafe, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations. The rice in the Nasi lemak was just plain rice, and the black coffee was disappointingly bad. I don't have high standards, but I will not return to this place. Not recommended.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101618764404579404742/reviews
Emily Ho,2,"Not so good. Quite expensive for the kind of food served. Signature pork stew bee hoon was bad. Teh si was thin and diluted. The prata was super oily. Scrambled eggs was overdone and tasted bland. The chee cheong fun sauce was a little too salty. Overall, not so good. Won't come again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106638367480970822498/reviews
