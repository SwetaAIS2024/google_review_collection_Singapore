Generous amount of garlic and secret chilly sauce that hits the sweet spot for this dish with a perfect subtle amount of vinegar that even someone who isnt a fan of vinegar like me appreciate its presence in the dish. Pork version is also available however the Fried fish combination surprises me. Definitely a highly recommended stall to visit.",
