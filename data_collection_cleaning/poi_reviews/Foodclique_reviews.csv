L L.,5,Normally would visit this coffeeshop whenever I visit the clinic on the same stretch. Have not encountered any issue but probably coz I always ordered the same food - toast + teh lol. The new uncle is humorous. Told him wanted toast to be abit toasted he said ok chao da toast lol. In the end he said joking ah and gave me this. Thank you uncle. ðŸ˜€ Fishball noodles stall is also not bad though haven't tried for very long. Environment is abit dirty but usually can't really find clean coffee shop anyway,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100023565305180246991/reviews
Alex,1,"Subject: Complaint Regarding Poor Customer Service at Tenderbest on January 2, 2025

Dear Tenderbest Management,

I am writing to express my deep disappointment with the unacceptable behavior of your cashier at this location on January 2, 2025, at approximately 3:15 PM.

My elderly father, who is not as tech-savvy, encountered difficulties while attempting to make a payment using the QR code displayed at the cashier counter. Despite his best efforts, the payment repeatedly failed to register. Another customer, observing the situation, also tried to make a payment via QR code but experienced the same issue.

When this other customer politely suggested that the QR code might be obstructed by oil or other residue, the cashier responded with an unacceptably raised voice. This display of unprofessionalism and a lack of empathy towards both my father and the other customer was deeply concerning.

I believe that your cashiers should be trained to assist customers with technical difficulties, especially those who may be less familiar with technology. Furthermore, maintaining a professional and courteous demeanor, even when facing minor challenges, is essential for providing a positive customer experience.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105447634052509914092/reviews

Sci Lu,1,"Saw another customer attempting to pay but QR code was faulty (another nearby customer tried the qr code and it wasnt working for them both)
Staff was rude and unprofessional, raising his voice at the customer (even though the customer was very polite).

Limited payment methods and the working payment method is faulty, yet the staff seemed to get angry with the customer.

Negative experience and disappointing to see this.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104158641897313779204/reviews
