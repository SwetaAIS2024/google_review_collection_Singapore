It is a pity that Australia and New Zealand don't follow your lead in restoration of these historic sites. Was the highlight of my trip to Sentosa and best of all it was free!",

The Skywalk offers great reviews.\nCons: it’s probably not a fun place to take kids or most people :) displays aren’t very interesting. A lot of material written is repeated. Seems a very set it, and forget it museum.",

Whilst crowds of people head for the \"modern entertainment\" attractions like the luge runs, theme park, aquarium, etc, this place is not only quiet and peaceful, but full of historic interest. Just follow the heritage trail, which will take you around the area, visiting gun batteries, old fort buildings, and museums. You can get here by just taking the Cablecar for some great views. Then, just take the lift up to the Skywalk, which brings you to the fort and heritage trail.",

But for people whom are interested in history and war, can always visit and take a hike.",

Some of the exhibition  will be active  when you walk into they and tell you what is happening all in english.  Great place for history people.  Everything is marked really well.",
