      "text": "My child attended Smartz Playhouse from infantcare level to almost N1. The teachers always greet the children warmly in the morning. Very patient and dedicated team of teachers. My child would often chat about her day in school and it's always positive. Daily activity updates communicated in the app, which is something not many schools do.\n\nNot as convenient if coming here on foot due to lack of shelters, and hilly terrain but from my experience, it's truly worth it, seeing how well my child has been cared for and nurtured by the teachers. Truly a gem of a preschool.",

      "text": "This is a hidden gem of a preschool in a lovely, quiet neighbourhood.\n\nStaff turnover has not been an issue, unlike our experience at other branded preschools. The level of genuine warmth and care Ms Koh and her teachers have shown to our children has also been exemplary. Activities here are very hands-on: we love that there is outdoor space for brightly themed decorations and games, gardening, and even a small chicken coop and a rabbit.\n\nThis school has also been operating for decades, which speaks volumes greater than the next new shiny thing. Of course there is always room for improvement, but our children consistently come home happy and chatty after a full day of play, and that alone for us warrants the five stars.",
