Aashu vashisht,1,Extremely disappointed with the school's management. Poor communication and lack of transparency. Refund issues have been a major concern.

Kv Revathi,5,My son has been studying in Little Moppets Tampines branch from 2022. So far we love the school and have amazing experience for our son. The class has max 15 kids but its usually divided for activities so the student teachers ratio is quite good. Teachers are paying close attention to kids and send regular updates thru the app. We can see lots of development and changes in our son over 2 yrs with them. Overall very happy and highly recommended,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110857319178463305876/reviews

Venessa Chow,1,My child donâ€™t attend this sch location but at Gambas. Generally teachers are good but management sucks. In 2023 July they suddenly closed down give me 1 month notice to find sch. Deposit drag n drag to refund me. Excuse over excuse and I had to keep chasing them for payment instead of them updating me. Until today jan 2024 I still have yet to received my full deposit $1.7k refund ! If you ever enrol to this school good luck to getting your refund.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263294787895084729/reviews
Alekya munelli,5,My daughter started from k1 after a long gap from school . I like the way her teachers understood what we said and helped her to catch-up with other kids. Teachers are cooperative and helpful . Activities for kids are very creative and useful .,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110308552010796093961/reviews
