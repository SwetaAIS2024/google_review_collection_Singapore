Then inside you will find a few plots of lands dedicated to small enterprises doing planting.\n\nThis place has a wide range of unique plants. I think if it is not unique, they will not stock it. Price is reasonable for this unique plants.\n\nOpening hours are short so do plan properly.",

Here the enthusiast will find an assortment of Philodendrons, Rhaphidophoras, Begonias and many other house plants. Well-organised and reasonably priced, my visit has always been welcomed with a smile and cheer, albeit behind a facial mask (in this pandemic times). I have no complaints about this nursery--it warrants a visit each time I am within its vicinity.\n\nMy only gripe would be they cut down the usage of plastic bags and opt for reusable, environmentally paper bags instead. Otherwise, great place. Drop by when you can!",
