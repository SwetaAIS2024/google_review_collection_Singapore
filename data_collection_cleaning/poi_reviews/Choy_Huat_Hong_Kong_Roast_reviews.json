      "text": "Choy Huat Hong Kong Roast has shifted to Blk 5036 AMK Industrial Park 2. Stall & owner were formerly from Sims Drive, with their own supporters.\n\nWe ordered de roast duck, roast pork, chicken and charsiew. Each item was well prepared. We particularly like de skin from de duck, which was so aromatic and crispy. The roast pork was skillfully done with the nice crackling skin, which is only available at restaurants. We also like de savoury sauce, which compliments the rice and meat well.\n\nPrice is reasonable too. Owner is quite pro and would deliver de part of meat you request. Really enjoyed my lunch and will definitely be back.",
