You order and make payment via a QR code at your table.\n\nThe plates from the previous diners were cleared, but the tables were not wiped. I had to use my own wet wipes to clean the table for them. I should have gotten a discount for that. LOL.\n\nServers lacked energy and looked like they didnâ€™t want to be there.\n\nWe ordered Otah Aglio, Beef Lasagna, and Seafood Rebus Calzone. All tasted decently good.",
