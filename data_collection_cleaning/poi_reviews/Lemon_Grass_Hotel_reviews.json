But it happened to be two(2) large bed. Otherwise it is just nice.\nBesides that, everything is fine.",

A room had a half opened soap bottle full of dust under one table and another room had a sticky floor the corner, a plastic bag left on the inside of the bedroom lamp and ciggarette ashes at the side of the toilet bowl. Most other rooms seem to have leftover batteries from the remote controls. Please do check and do not expect guests to replace the batteries to the remote controls. Service wise, everything was fine.",

You can find food in another store near the hotel. The room cleaning service is optional, if you want the staff make your bed and change your towel with a new one.",
