Syawani Erina,1,"I visited the clinic around 1:30 pm on a friday (20 December 2024). When I came, the clinic sign indicated as Close and the lights were switched off eventhough Google states the clinic is open till 4am. So I had no choice but to enter and there it was the clinic assistant at the front desk. I asked if  the clinic was open and her tone was so rude & clearly showed that she was unhappy. It’s bad enough that we came in sick, the least she could do is be kind. It didnt stop there when she started asking me questions in the rudest & most sarcastic tone ever. I informed her that I had an insurance coverage and she went “u never show me, i dont know” Isnt that the first thing you asked as well before proceeding to give a queue number?Do you really wanna keep this kind of clinic assistant? Based on the reviews shown, bet I wasn’t the only one having the same feeling. I believe you should start sourcing out for better customer service clinic assistant.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112780294976717305138/reviews

Ken Tng,1,"Opening hours stated is wrong. Clinic supposed to be open at 8.30am, been waiting since 8.15am. gave them another 7 minutes past opening hours and still nobody in sight. People come to you because they are feeling unwell yet you can't even uphold your professional commitment. Will never visit again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113586734534020590732/reviews

Zay Joe,1,"If only the staff at the reception can be more kinder then it would be nice. People come in as sick people and people tend to be vulnerable and sensitive, just be kind ok. I didnt walk in into a thug shop.. dont make me feel like i owe money from you. Usually the doctors here are good and concerned too but not the one(Yen Yen Ho) i visited today. Walked into the room i greeted her but answered with silence. Told her i had ankle tendinitis and she inspected my heel. I informed her it’s my ankle caused me pain not the heel. Then she proceeded to say “but the previous doctor wrote the heel.” I thought doctors supposed to hear from the patient side? No? And why did the previous doctor wrote heel? Hmm..",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108736058073322425620/reviews
