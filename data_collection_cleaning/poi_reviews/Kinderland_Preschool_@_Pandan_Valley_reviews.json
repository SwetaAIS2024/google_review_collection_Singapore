As a parent, I am extremely grateful to the teachers who have journeyed with us through the years; they have been patient, kind, nurturing and loving. The curriculum is robust and fun, with a good mix of indoor and outdoor activities. They played hard and yet, learnt well ! My son really enjoyed his pre-school years in Kinderland. Special thanks to Miss Connie,  Zhang Lao Shi, Miss Gretchen, Lin Lao Shi and Li Lao Shi and Miss Bernie for everything you all have done.",

Thank you Kinderland Pandan Valley for all the efforts and care you have provided our family :)",
