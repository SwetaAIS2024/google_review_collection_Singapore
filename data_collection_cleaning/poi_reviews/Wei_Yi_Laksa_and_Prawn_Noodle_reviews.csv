Alvin Choo,3,"Caveat -  I didn't actually eat the entire bowl of this, but I had a small portion dished out that contained bits of the full portion.

I have wanted to try this for the longest time, but it's kind of a hassle for me to go to. But I finally went.

I think the broth is the most essential part of a bowl of laksa, but this was too watery and ruined the entire experience. I frankly don't understand why there's a queue for this standard of laksa. The other ingredients were as expected.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
Ribeye,4,"This decades-old hawker stall in Tanglin Halt Market draws snaking queues for its laksa, a recipe rumored to hail from the owner’s Peranakan roots. The broth is coconut-rich with a mild spice kick, generously topped with plump cockles, shredded chicken, tofu puffs, and fresh laksa leaves. Noodles strike a balance between springy and soft, and the overall flavor is comforting—though not revolutionary. Wait times can hit 30+ minutes during peak hours, testing patience for a bowl that’s satisfying but lacks the “wow” factor to justify the hype.

The no-frills stall operates in a nostalgic neighborhood hub, adding to its charm. While the laksa won’t dethrone Singapore’s top contenders, its reliability and heritage appeal make it a decent stop if you’re nearby. Pro tip: Visit mid-morning on weekdays to dodge crowds. A solid bowl for traditionalists, but temper expectations if queuing during peak hours.
Prices are around $5-6 a bowl depending on ingredient combinations.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108129213100021627372/reviews
Kenneth Lee,4,"First time trying this famous stall notorious for long queues. Luckily, I had a relatively short wait. Broth was leaning on the milder and thinner side but does not equate to lack of flavour. The Ipoh style chicken slices and beancurd are good.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101880682982581996030/reviews
lbbgs84,3,Standard seem to drop but queue got longer and portion smaller but pricier. Its decent but is it worth that close to 1 hour waiting time. Already long waiting time but owner still making “side orders”..,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115977853187216002475/reviews
Bel,4,"I remember the laska broth as being mild yet fragrant. But when I tried it recently, it was rather salty. Not sure if it's my taste that has changed.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115565173774207530812/reviews
