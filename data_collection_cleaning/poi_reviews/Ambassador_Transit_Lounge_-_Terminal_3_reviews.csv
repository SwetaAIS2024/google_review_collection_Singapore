JR,5,"Had a great time visiting this place!

The food looked good, with a decent variety, though I only tried their coffee, scrambled eggs, and egg whites.

They have an espresso machine where you can add your own milk and ice, which was a nice touch.

The staff were very kind and provided great service! They were also very helpful. I asked the chef to make fried egg whites for me, and he gladly did‚Äîhe even offered to add chicken and onions!

The staff manager (a guy) also seemed very friendly and supportive toward his team. I loved seeing the harmony among the staff working together. Keep up the great work!

Bonus points: the toilet was clean too!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114550840373190192032/reviews
Melissa,5,"Ambassador transit lounge food
I was in Bali for eight days and they had no Mexican food but when I checked in to the ambassador transit lounge they had nachos.
Real corn chips with cheese and it made me really happy. Ivy and Roger were so kind when I told them how happy it made me to finally eat a Mexican snack. Thank you so much üôè",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102291767088600294992/reviews
Vicki Wilkinson,3,"We were there later in the evening and to be honest the experience was grim. The food was of lower quality than I would expect from a lounge area. You had to make a special request for alcohol. Some of the seats lacked comfort. Would have been better for us to have used the food courts on the same level as it would have been cheaper, tastier and quieter at 11pm.

On the positive side, the cakes were very nice and the man at the front desk was really friendly and helpful.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111298198991894670342/reviews
