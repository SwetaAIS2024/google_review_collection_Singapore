mohamad syaznil,3,"Their signature Briyani is just average for me however the portion is big for the price. On the other hand, surprisingly their murtabak tastes much better than the rival across the street. The service however is very poor. They are not very accommodating and definitely not attentive.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107017250200180112141/reviews

R J,2,"Brought a colleague from overseas from faraway here recently for Iftar.

Food quantity to price ratio was so-so. Portions were small and we left the restaurant still feeling hungry.

It was only 8pm and seems odd the waiter was pressuring us to make our last order and it was embarrassing for me as a host, as I felt bad about the service and regretted the choice.
Online the closing time shows 9.30pm though.
However, the owner's nephew was kind to us.

Because we felt rushed, the dinner tasted dull and experience disappointing.

Sorry to say, i will not return.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113243249089147632719/reviews
