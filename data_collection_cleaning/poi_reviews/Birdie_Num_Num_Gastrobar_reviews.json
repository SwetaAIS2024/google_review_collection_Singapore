      "text": "I decided to visit this place after remembering passing by an eponymous cafe in Paris. Boy, I wasn't disappointed! The French style food served here is savoury, hearty, and full of flavour. But they go beyond replicating the typical French pub fare. The dishes are spun to go well with drinks and beer. Speaking of alcoholic drinks, they have lots on offer at reasonably standard prices. The only lacking section is cocktails. I would imagine they could mix you one if you asked, but it's not on the regular menu. Otherwise, I highly recommend sharing a plate of Sinful Fries with a friend or two in addition to whatever you may wish to order. The atmosphere of the cafe is welcoming, yet chill and unpretentious in the manner many French inspired pubs in CBD/Chinatown areas. Give it a try next time you want to go out for a square lunch or dinner with drinks.",

      "text": "The vibes here really good and seems like most patrons are regulars, families and fres. We came here since it's on burple offering 1-for-1. And so we ordered 2 mains, a salmon and chicken chop. While both dishes are pretty good, the portion is really small and I wonder if it's 1-for-1 portions. And then we were served our mushroom soups which we thought shd be served before the mains? ü§î\nWe were initially surprised the mushroom soup comes in a cup, and felt relieved once we took a spoonful very flavouful with generous slices of mushroom. This is what homemade mushroom soup shd be like.üëç\nAnd finally the pizzas were quite good as well, with very generous ingredients and super thin crust.\nOverall this bistro bar is not bad, just wished they serve water and shorter wait for the food.\nBonus is there's no service charge and gst so all's forgiven.",

Mushroom soup is outright salty, wings were good, the Yakitori were good starters. But a nice place to have a drink with friends. Lack of parking options.",
