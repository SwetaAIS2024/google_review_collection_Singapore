      "text": "The staffs are friendly, lil slow but nevermind about that, the doctor was good. The thing that disappointed me was people who already left after receiving their numbers. When they come back again they are called in. For example: Patient number 19 left and now the running number is 25 and the 25th patient coming out from the treatment room, the patient number 26 waiting to go in but since patient number 19 is back he or she is called. TBH this is unfair for the people who are already waiting. If others can wait so can You and the clinic make this as a normal practice… Went for a very very bad back pain today entered the clinic between 10:40-11:00Hrs and because of this issue left the clinic almost at 13:15Hrs. Trully disappointed…",

Came in without IC when I already had a history with the clinic (it’s been the family clinic for many years) then assistant insisted I must produce IC. Another patient came in without and she asked for name to register? I missed to register my queue two times because of the assistant’s unwillingness to help.",
