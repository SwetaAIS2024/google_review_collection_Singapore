Ordered, Appam, naadan chicken roast, beef roast Angamali pork roast.
Great food and good service.
The combination  with Toddy makes it unique.

Nithin Poonkottil,1,This was one of my go to restaurants. But nowadays food quality has become pathetic honestly. The crew does not know how to deal with customers complaining about the quality of food.
