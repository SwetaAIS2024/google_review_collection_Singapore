Zhi Ming Ng,5,"Took my family to try this korean mala tang. Restaurant was empty when we reached on a working weekday evening, but still decided to go ahead anyway. The service was great - the lady welcomed us in and did an introduction of the menu. We ordered three types - malatang level 0 (non-spicy) for our kid, level 2, and malaban level level 2. All ingredients were well prepared to our satisfaction.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114475351636013480843/reviews

Franklin Ye,5,"As a traveler from LA KTown, my standards for K Mala Tang are high and I was pleasantly surprised by my find here. Ingredients were fresh, service was good, and the overall taste was great. I was particularly surprised by the fried chicken - the chicken was boneless yet tasted & looked like bone-in chicken (which in my book is vastly superior to boneless chicken). Will be going back when I am in the mood for Mala Tang.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110480819217887749489/reviews
