      "text": "Simon is an excellent piano teacher: he is infinitely patient and very encouraging, and makes classes fun! Simon is incredibly knowledgeable and has a knack for explaining music theory and piano techniques. He also customises the classes according to what you'd like to learn, and aims to improve your weaknesses with lots of tips, drills, and exercises for practicing outside of class.\n\nWith the in-person classes, Simon arranges drums loops and plays along, so you'd get a feel of what it's like to play with others in a band; it's very satisfying.\n\nI'd highly recommend Simon for anyone looking to learn the piano, regardless of your level and age. As someone who has abandoned the piano as a child, Simon has rekindled my love and interest in the instrument, and I've seen more progress with him in 3-4 months than I did as a child for a year. 10/10.",

      "text": "Starting as a beginner, it has been fun and fulfilling to take piano lessons from Simon. Simon is both firm and encouraging in his teaching, and offers various tips and methods to learning theory, music pieces, and working on weakness areas. I appreciate the weekly task list that Simon provides, which guides me in self-practice outside of lesson. There is flexibility in learning a mix of classical and pop tunes. Online Zoom lessons have also been working well for me.\n\nOverall, it‚Äôs the first time I saw progress for myself after unsuccessfully trying to self-learn previously, and I would recommend Simon as a teacher for beginner adult players looking to embark on their piano journey",
