Ridiculous 40% increase in price.\n\nOriginal review:\nReally umami soup mee hon kueh - a rare find in AMK.  Fried dumplings is also one of the best I've eaten. Ordered like 10 times in past 2 months on deliveroo. Chili given was generous too. Delicious üòãüòãüòãview",

      "text": "Probably the best Mee Hoon Kueh you can get in this area and maybe the entire AMK GRCüòçüòç The dough is hand pulled into pieces and tossed into the aromatic broth. You can request the lady boss to make your Mee Hoon Kueh to be Al Dante or fully cooked. Add in Flavourful mince pork, spinach and crunchy ikan billis! Best of all, she add in a half boiled egg into your bowl! All these put together and look at it dancing in the broth. Served hot!\n\nThey also sells egg trio spinach and fried dumplings.\n\nI love both the dry and soup version of this Mee Hoon Kueh. Recommend to come here and try.",
