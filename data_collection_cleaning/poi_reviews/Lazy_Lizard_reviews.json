The ambience is calm and welcoming, with plenty of space and thoughtful touches that make it easy to bring kids along.\n\nWe ordered the steak and pork, and both dishes were spot on. The meat was tender, cooked perfectly, and full of flavor. Portions were satisfying, and the prices felt very reasonable for the quality. It‚Äôs definitely a place we‚Äôd return to. Great for a casual dinner or a relaxed weekend meal with the family.",

The kids food are a little bit on the salty and sweet side. But once in a while should be fine. Pizzas are delicious, especially truffle salami.\n\nNot a lot of people, always managed to get a table promptly.\n\nService staffs are attentive.",

      "text": "First time here!\n\nTried their Hokkaido Oysters. Half dozen for $10, super worth it. The fresh one is fleshy and fresh. The baked cheese one is juicy with a generous layer of savoury melted cheese and mayonnaise.\n\nThe pork rack 350g is super huge, probably can share with someone. The meat is super soft and tender, the peppercorn cream sauce is so fragrant and enhanced the flavours of the meat. Love the fries that taste good even when cold.\n\nThe sirloin steak is good too. The pepper taste is on the stronger side with a spicy kick.\n\nThey give a free juice or double scoop ice cream for a Google review.\n\nI will definitely be back to try more of their dishes",
