Orange,1,"Disgusting. Totally not worth the calories. Tried their new salted egg chicken. Sauce isn’t nice. Chicken is over cooked. Salted egg burger. Corn burger doesn’t go well with salted egg.

The two spicy wing is pathetic, small and not spicy at all. Plus it’s not even nice. Hard and over cooked.

Worse experience for Popeyes. They need to improve their cooking skill or they will be out in this market of fast food.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
Abraham Lee,4,"Happy that there are more fast food options at Rail mall and this is a great addition! Chicken came piping home and they have an indoor area with seats for folks dining in. The biscuits are great too. Overall good quality for a fast food outlet.

Perhaps they could give buzzers or increase the size of the order number on the screen instead of having to shout each number manually..",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
Esther Teo,4,The fried chicken was tender and freshly cooked. It is conveniently located near the MRT.  Staff were friendly. They even gave me a take away box to bring my extra pieces home.

Dylan Lim,4,"Popeyes is super delicious and tasty, I love the chicken burgers there the most. The atmosphere at the Railway mall outlet is nice and comfy. Service wise could be improved as they often keep yelling out orders which can become irritating. Overall really good place to eat at",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105150104907619807912/reviews
