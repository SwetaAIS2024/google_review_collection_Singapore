AQ Liew,5,"Everything that we ordered was cooked with care. Zucchini flowers stuffed with smoked cheese was crispy outside and soft inside. Braised beef was tender and risotto cooked perfectly. My steak was also on the money in terms of doneness. Fave of the night was dessert though - the tiramisu had enough of a bitter coffee hit to make it memorable. They gave an additional dessert too since it was my birthday :)

Service was excellent as well!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109045068293613328093/reviews
Pratyush Rastogi,5,"Been to Garibaldi many times over the years. Food is highly consistent, service is excellent, and its reasonably priced for a 1 Michelin star. They will also go out of their way to make changes to the dish/menu for you. In general if you're looking for great Italian food done with passion and flavour - this is the place.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102534492980648066061/reviews

J W,5,"Came here for a belated bday dinner and totally surprised by the attention to detail in their service and food! You know itâ€™s good when the bread is hot and yummy. We got the seasonal menu and one extra dish to try and they were SOOO GOOD, especially the angel hair pasta with the caviar, the poached egg dish, and their pastas. They even gave me a dessert as a birthday treat! ðŸ’¯ service too. Also saw they won a lot of awards for their wine selections, not a big fan of Prosecco but theirs was so good and no hangover! Highly recommend for a date, birthday, or a cozy holiday meal!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105688750089710096162/reviews
