      "text": "Rude and dishonest. Asked for the bigger portion at $5.50 instead of $4.50. Was given a miserable portion of rice and the amount of chicken meat was like no difference with the smaller portion at $4.50. When asked to add more rice since I already paid $5.50 for the big portion, still had the cheek to charge me an extra $1. Paid $6.50 in total. First and last time here. Avoid this stall unless u enjoy being scammed. To the boss of this stall, U do business like this, better u close shop lah. Big scammer!",
