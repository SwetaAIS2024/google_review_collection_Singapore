      "text": "Came for a weekday lunch. Nasi Lemak @67 is situated within the Ang Mo Kio 628 Market. There was already a lunch queue forming but it was fast moving. Kakak who took the order was friendly. The order menu is simplified as they are categorised alphabetically. Ordered set G, the nasi lemak with quarter chicken for $6, which is pretty affordable for what you're getting.\n\nThe 2nd Kakak was busy frying a new batch of chicken, so got the quarter chicken piping hot. Got the order within 5-7mins, Kakak did ask whether I was ok to wait for the fresh batch of chicken mentioned above.\n\nThe nasi lemak itself is probably one of the nicest tasting, way better than the overrated ones in Changi Village. The rice used is quality basmati rice, and flavour wise, it is just splendid. Fluffy, fragrant and lemak (rich from the coconut).\n\nThe quarter chicken was just as good, definitely fresh and not the frozen chicken variety. The outer batter was not overly thick, fried to a very crispy finish, leaving a very satisfying crunch. The chicken meat was tender and juicy, it did help I got a batch straight from the frying wok.\n\nThe nasi lemak chilli was also nice, tangy and sweet at the same time. The accompanying ikan bills (small anchovies) were not overly saltish and the peanuts had enough crunch and were not stale. Lastly, the fried sunny side up egg was not overcooked, soft and not rubbery. Overall a very satisfying lunch set, glad to have found Nasi Lemak@67, a hidden nasi lemak gem nestled in one of the older parts of Ang Mo Kio, on the fringes of Yio Chu Kang.",
