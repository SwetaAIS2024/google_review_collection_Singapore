      "text": "Poor customer service! The first time I‚Äôve been in the clinic, they assigned me to an unexperienced therapist, who is not even a dermatologist but a flight attendant who had ONE MONTH of training in Aivee Clinic Singapore. How could you allow this kind of service!  My skin is very sensitive and I have made this clear from the start. However, the doctor‚Äôs assessment was always on a grey area of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see what will happen‚Äù. Let‚Äôs try this or that. I thought its just my face adjusting to their treatment and products so I came the second time around. This time the doctor recommended to do a Diamond Peel plus some other treatment and a change of products for skin maintenance. It made my skin breakout even more! I‚Äôm not recommending this clinic especially if you want your skin to look better and get the value for what you pay for.",

It even worsened my pimple at one point.\n\nAivee Clinic gave solutions to my problem. The consultation was so bespoke that they highlighted my needs. I highly recommend Aerolase and GLP for my pimples. It has been 4 weeks since I tried these services and face looks rejuvenated, glowing and my pimples significantly reduce by almost 80-90%\n\nThank you to my therapist Ruby for taking of my face and for giving an excellent service. Thank you to Dr. Abi for your help. I also want to give credit to staffs as they are very professional.",
