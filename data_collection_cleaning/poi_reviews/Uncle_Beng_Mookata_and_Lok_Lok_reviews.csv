Michelle Tan,5,"S$20 Nett for eat all you can mookata Buffet. Lok Lok S$1(nett) per stick.
,.
My favorite have to be their meat, both pork and chicken. I tried their Garlic pork collar, Sesame pork collar, Garlic chicken and Spicy chicken. They do not have beef which I don‚Äôt eat too. I especially love their pork collar as it is not too fatty, tender and delectable. For mookata lover like me, this is a must go to eat üòã at a pocket friendly buffet (eat all you can) price of S$20 nett. They do not use msg in their food and soup. üëç I tossed the mama instant noodles with their two in house made chilli sauces, it is tasty üòã
,.
For drink, I tried their signature Thai milk tea. S$3.50. They use brown sugar, it is not sweet and pretty nice. üòãüëç.
