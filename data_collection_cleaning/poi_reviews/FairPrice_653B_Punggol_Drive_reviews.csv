Yi Ling,4,"Rather small Fair Price, but it has EVERYTHING one needs as a convenient one-stop shop for all grocery needs. Very new and well equipped, the space is very well utilised to stock up on a variety of frozen, fresh, and household needs.

There is even a hot water station and quick bites for instant noodles consumption, and also a elderly help station for those who may have difficulty shopping.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115707001285123682601/reviews

Kin Hee Teo (ZenTKH),5,"A 24 Hour FairPrice supermarket just opened on 12 Oct 2023 in the Waterway Sunrise district. This will bring convenience to all the residents of Waterways Sunrise. This supermarket is small compare to the bigger branch at Waterwaypoint.
The other nearest supermarket is Ang Mo at Kadaloor LRT",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111162945558883585897/reviews
Ann Zack,1,"Lousy fairprice i ever went. All item is not for normal household used. Certain rice brand only have 5kg and limited number. Everytime things don't have. When ask, staff said not stock up yet. Looks full of item but when you want to get things you want, it does not sell here. Even salt only sell many brands but all fine salt! Worst Fairprice store!! Still need to go Oasis branch to get salt(course/normal), 10kg rice of Jasmin fairprice brand etc.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105872289946004972335/reviews
