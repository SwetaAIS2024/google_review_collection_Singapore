LAN ANH ƒê·ªó,5,"Order thru app to pick up. New users will get couples of voucher, esp 1st order at $0.99. The app has quite detailed descriptions of the drinks' flavour which i find very helpful. They also have some small desserts as well.

The original price is on a high side, higher than Starbucks & less options. But since they seem to have voucher often. Should be fine

Do note that you can only pick up, no seat to dine in here",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110493988104625912644/reviews

Ming Wei Lee,5,Fast and furious. Easy for quick order and if you are from outside area u can conveniently place an order and pick up as there is a big drop off area in the building and once u step out u will see luckin coffee. They also have first timer discount. Will recommend if you want a quick cuppa. Have good packaging as well.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107724540457866476907/reviews
Krishna Grace Fajardo,5,"So far I‚Äôve tried iced Creamy Dreamy Latte, Velvet Latte, and Big Cheese Latte. And Velvet Latte is my favorite ‚Äî be it less or least sweet. The best üíïü•∞
Also, I love the strawberry flavor daifuku and tiramisu flavor daifuku. ü´∂üèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114548222797593393092/reviews
MC Lim,1,"Just bought my first cup of latte from Luckin coffee.
Ordered less sweet, but the latte is still very sweet and the sweetness is weird. And, the latte has no coffee taste & fragrance too. What a latte tastes like sugar water.. so disappointing.
No wonder Starbucks always so crowded. McCaf√© is a much better and valued option too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116262179278292048747/reviews
