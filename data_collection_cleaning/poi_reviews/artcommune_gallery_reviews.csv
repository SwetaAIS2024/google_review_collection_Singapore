Andras Varsanyi,5,I have been coming by this gallery for about a year now. They always have a nice selection of works on display and a broad range of art available for sale. They are really approaching art with a keen and respectful eye and looking out for the best interest of the client. Mr Ho is great and he also built a very nice team. Also want to mention that the special exhibitions they organize are world class (latest example is their Cheong Soo Pieng retrospective).,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104601719864647052797/reviews
