The queue number never moves. Meanwhile, I can hear the Grab orders keep coming and they are still taking in order from walk-in customer.\n\nThe place is now so crowded with people waiting for their food (both dine-in and deliveries). They should have stopped taking order if they have too much order to handle!\n\nI can see the staff frantically cooking the food with balls flying as they try to move as fast as they can.",
