      "text": "I recently visited BMM VIP for a car wash service for my large MPV. Overall, the experience was okay, but there were a few aspects that stood out, both positive and negative.\n\n**Service Quality:**\nThe car wash itself was fairly standard—nothing exceptional, but it got the job done. The wash was quick, likely because there weren’t many customers at the time (I visited late in the day). However, I noticed that my car wasn’t fully dried after the wash, which was a bit disappointing. A thorough dry is something I’d expect as part of the service, especially for a larger vehicle.\n\n**Upselling:**\nThe staff were polite but kept pushing for additional services, such as waxing or interior cleaning. While I understand they might be trying to upsell due to the lack of customers, it did feel a bit persistent. That said, I appreciate their effort to promote their services, and it didn’t come across as overly aggressive.\n\n**Price:**\nAt RM25 for a large MPV, the price seems reasonable and offers good value for money. It’s definitely affordable compared to some other car wash options in the area.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nThis car wash shop is decent for a quick and affordable clean, but don’t expect anything extraordinary. The service is efficient, though the lack of thorough drying and the constant upselling were minor drawbacks. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly option and don’t mind a basic wash, this place is worth considering. However, if you’re after a more premium experience, you might want to explore other options.\n\n**Rating:** 3/5\n- Pros: Affordable, fast service, polite staff.\n- Cons: Car not fully dried, persistent upselling, average wash quality.\n\nWould I return? Maybe, but only if I’m in a hurry and need a quick, budget-friendly wash.",

      "text": "Omg, what a car wash service! I tell them I want water wax and clean, they asked me to do a wax service, that’s ok, I do it, price is RM50. The worker scratched my dashboard! Multiple scratches on the dashboard! They also make my dashcam wire disconnect from the camera! Inside was not really clean, I need to wipe again by myself. Donno how rough they clean the car, because we left the car and eat breakfast at warung express(corner lot restaurant)",
