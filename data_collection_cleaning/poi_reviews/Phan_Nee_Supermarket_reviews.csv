Alex Ong,2,"I went to this outlet thrice and i wasn't aware of the no bringing of bags inside the supermarket, first two visits, nobody bothered to inform me and for the last time, the staffs told me to keep my bag outside, I obliged and was surprised to saw another guy carrying a small pouch and he wasn't told to put it outside, I mean don't have double standards in your outlet, must be fair to every patron who are patronising the supermarket.
