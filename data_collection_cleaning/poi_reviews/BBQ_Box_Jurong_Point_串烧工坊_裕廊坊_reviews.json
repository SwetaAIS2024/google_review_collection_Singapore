Staff was also open about discounts available and even reminded us when the discount timing has reached to order the food. Atmosphere was not noisy, allowing you to have a good conversation with your dining partners. No1 among the branches in my opinion.",

Also those meat had holes so meaning they were with sticks but for some reason the skewers were removed from the sticks then was put in the box. We didn‚Äôt eat to be on safe side. Reported in foodpanda and was given a refund but not really why it happened. The chicken gizzard and chicken skewers were ok.",
