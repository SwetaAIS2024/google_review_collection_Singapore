Johanna Hanny,5,"Beautifully preserved 19th century architecture with a rich cultural heritage that spans over 160 years. Note that Masjid Al-Abrar is now located in a bustling area, with nearby establishments including bars and restaurants serving alcohol. Despite this, the mosque remains a tranquil escape from the surrounding activity",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104426067676310731633/reviews
Fya Putri,5,"Near amoy street, if your bus stop around chinatown, you can go the direction through ann siang hill park, and go through  the alley, but perhaps it is not comfortable if you bring stroller or luggage.

Amar Koul,5,"Alhamdullilah. It is a gem to find a masjid in the middle of street within the CBD that is full of worldly bustle. The interior is so peaceful and allows one to unwind from his/her worries. It is run primarily by the Tamil-Muslim community so if you aren’t used to a different style of prayers, you may want to consider someplace else (quite speedy and no provision for Ruku’).

For drivers, as many before me have mentioned, it can be quite difficult as you’d imagine in the CBD. If streetside parking isn’t available, there’s Frasers Tower along Telok Ayer St.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100276120372481396557/reviews
