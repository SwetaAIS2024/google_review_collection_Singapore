      "text": "I got the exact same poster I was looking for from this store! It's my first time to have a \"chirashi\" and it made all the experience so meaningful for me. I'm a huge fan of Attack On Titan and I was so happy that I discovered Poster Hub SG.\n\nI do recommend folks to visit their showroom as they got tons of pretty prints in wide range and various categories and sizes. The place is cool too and the staff accommodated me very well. I had a fast and smooth online purchase and fun overall experience!! Will definitely come back for those Japanese anime film chirashi!!
