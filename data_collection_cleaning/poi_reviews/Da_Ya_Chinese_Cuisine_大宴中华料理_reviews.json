      "text": "Located in the food court of the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes food court, it's exactly what you would expect. Overpriced mall food for tourists. Unfortunately, we had no choice because we were starving, didn't have time to venture outside of the Shoppes area, and we didn't want noodles, which is what most of the other stalls in the food court were serving. Dan Ya serves clay pot rice and we had a pork one. Although it's not really authentic clay pot rice because they just scoop cooked rice into a clay pot and heat it up. But I guess since it's a food court setting, food needs to be churned out quickly so that may be their only method. Overall, it was pretty basic and a little too salty.",

      "text": "Ordered food through Grab. During pick up, they indicate that they never have Grab and shoo me away. I informed that I have paid for my food and i recheck the address. They said correct. Then they went to check with chef, the chef told them why you wrap the machine inside plastic. They then proceed to prepare my food. The staff (girl) keeps pointing fingers at me when they prepare my food. After done, they put my food out like 10 mins before she used her hand to gesture me to collect instead of ringing the buzzer I had on my hand.",

The biggest problem was that I developed diarrhea and sickness 7 hours after the meal. Definitely unrecommended. Service in the restaurant was also poor- they usher you away by saying “it takes 10+ mins to cook this!”",
