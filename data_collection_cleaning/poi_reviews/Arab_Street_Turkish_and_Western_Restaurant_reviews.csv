Lenn,5,"Atmosphere was very lively and comforting, very cozy place. Food was great! Somehow we received a small plate of turkish baklava at the end after paying, very surprising. Tasted amazing too but too sweet for my liking.

Service was 10/10, staff was very friendly and outgoing. I would recommend you to ask the staff how to order as the portions are quite big. Will definitely come back again!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116848416797244222105/reviews

Shamu Arul,5,"Easily my favourite Turkish restaurant in Yishun. This place carries a beautiful atmosphere in the neighbourhood , delicious food menu which constantly evolves as they bring in new options. I always enjoy Tagine Chicken Mandi over here. The service here is impeccable, and the owner and staff here are so so kind. Also, the order arrives promptly to the table. To our delight, we even had ice cream on the house. On a tiring day, having good food with wonderful customer service just warms your heart with kindness and happiness. I will return back again in the future âœ¨ðŸ’¯ Do come over with your loved ones !",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115744397641013224952/reviews
