Valen Luah,1,My experience with Courier Coverage : Order has been place one day before and I've called the next day morning to remind as I don't have confidence with their service (too many times bad experience) and true enough no one turn up to pick up my document despite is 2 hours service (document only pick up at 11.22am after many reminder calls and this document has to deliver from Raffles Place to Jurong Gateway before 12pm). Service is very very lousy and I can't believe they still can survive.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113291140344605986832/reviews
Who Am I?,1,"Not even 1 star! ZERO for your company name! Coordinator so rude! Talk like we owe them money! Very very rude! This very rude woman > You are lucky i never get the chance to take down your name because too angry with your rudeness and tone of voice! Who are you to talk to me like that kind of tone! Please Management, go and send your coordinator to CUSTOMER SERVICE COURSE or even more better go and send your coordinator to ANGER MANAGEMENT COURSE! Please have some respect! Nonsense!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104406667995272435015/reviews
Catherine Lee,5,"Very pleased with the experience that I have received with this company. I was slightly skeptical at first due to the reviews that were given by previous users. However, I decided to give them a shot and was pleasantly surprised. I called for an hour service and the customer service representative who took my order was helpful and patient when I asked for the pricing. My order was delivered before the 1 hour mark and I was given a call by the dispatch rider when my order was delivered (as requested by me). Will definitely use them again.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115626290521133536736/reviews
Ndrew,5,"They are fast and responsive, within mins will respond to my email and request. Courier are efficient and fast. My company have been using them for many years , frankly there is no 100% perfect but to me, they are reliable team. If they canâ€™t make it , they will call to arrange for a better solution. Hopefully courier are given a set of good quality raincoat as our weather are bad at times. Thanks team for the great service!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112926907815415589743/reviews
