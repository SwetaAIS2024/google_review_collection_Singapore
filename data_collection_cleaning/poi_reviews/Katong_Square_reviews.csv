Donald Parengkuan,5,The place is not too crowded and there are lots of restaurants at your preference. The pedestrian walk is also wide enough so it is safe to walk especially in the evening because there are enough lightning and in the afternoon is not so hot because there are lots of trees. There are also some small shopping malls around the area.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113185494810211437115/reviews
Hao Tan,3,Its a mall connected with Hoiday Inn express Hotel and Hotel Indigo. Few restaurants inside with a chinese Style cafe. Its deserted most of the time. If you prefer a clean market for your coffee or a meal. Its a good place. There car park available at this mall.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117487638688399238932/reviews
Flo Yeow,2,"It's an okay mall. Not the best, and definitely not the best around Katong. Honestly with the plot size, the design, and the integration with the 2 hotel chains here (Indigo and Holiday Inn), it's just very messy. Not much foot fall traffic, and weird synergy of retailers here. Honestly would rather shop around i12 Katong, or not at all, if given the option.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Lan,1,"Poor service by an elderly lady called Tukien who owns the mini-bottle cabinet. I asked if she could identify a bottle I had that was similar to the ones inside.

She repeatedly scolded me even after I said ""okay"" and thanked her for her time, telling me the same thing over and over again about checking the date on the bottle or googling it. I tried to end the conversation, only to be met with - ""I keep telling you, but you DON'T SEEM TO..."" and her repeating the same information.

I get that she's not an expert. I didn't expect that sort of information from her and thanked her for her time when she couldn't provide it. What was completely uneccessary was the way she berated and humiliated me for asking.

Please be wary of this shopowner.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112963454929846804894/reviews
Andy Ho,4,"A rather small mall that's about a year old. But considering it's right below a couple of hotels (Hotel Indigo and Holiday Inn Express) it's an interesting concept. Shops are limited. No supermarket in this mall, but no shortage of food options. There's sufficient parking here and the occasional weekend bazaar.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106350579308720381865/reviews
