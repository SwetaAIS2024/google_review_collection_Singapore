Yan Chung,1,"Unbelievable. Just because my mother in law didn't order a lot, they couldn't be bothered to serve. When they finally served the dish it was shockingly expensive. Simply shocking - $7.20 for an average serving of fried rice noodle (which was mass produced and ready cooked, they just reheat), with a slice of luncheon meat, and a stock of ngor heong and one century egg

I don't know what manner of arrogance this hawker is in AMK but so far this town has little to offer.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102713577753449498524/reviews
TTT,4,"Well-fried with a good variety to choose from. Didn’t get to try the beehoon, but it was a popular choice among others. The chili had a nice spice level but could have tasted better.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117174446031825028588/reviews
Desmond Teo,5,"Despite encountering a few negative reviews about the service, my personal experience with this establishment has been consistently positive over multiple orders. The highlight for me is the Bee Hoon, which boasts a smooth, delicate texture that pairs perfectly with the accompanying ingredients. Each bite is flavorful and satisfying.

A standout on the menu is undoubtedly the prawn crackers—a dish so irresistible that ordering just one portion simply won’t suffice. Light, crispy, and bursting with savory flavor, they are an absolute must-try.

The rest of the offerings are equally commendable, with well-prepared ingredients that elevate the dining experience. Paired with a cold beer, these dishes make for an excellent and indulgent accompaniment.

All in all, this spot is a great find for casual dining and drinks, offering dishes that hit the mark for taste and quality.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116507833791876452319/reviews

Stanley,4,"Located in S-11 coffeeshop, this busy stall attracts a steady queue during peak hours. Their beehoon was really good, very flavorful. Wide variety of items to select from. Items were fried to crisp, not oily at all too and perfect with their homemade chili sauce. Price maybe on the higher side, compared to other similar Wu Xiang stalls. Worth a try, if you are around this area.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109779294020772182875/reviews
