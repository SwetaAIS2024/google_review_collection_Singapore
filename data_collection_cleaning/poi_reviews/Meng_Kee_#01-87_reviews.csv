Super Fragrance,3,"Is amazing that given the queue there is only 15 reviews. But honestly nostalgic point were scored more than actual taste. Got the basic lemon chicken rice for $3.50.

Pro
Chicken. Crispy, juicy and tasty.

Standard chill but being on the slightly sweeter side

Meh
While $3.50 seems cheap but not alot of chicken to be had. I will probably add a serving of fried chicken for $1.

Soup is weird. Fried shallot in soup.

Not much lemon sauce given.

Cons
The rice was soggy and sticky. Taste is there but too soggy.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
Yun Xiang,3,"This place only sells chicken cutlets with various gravy or grilled chicken chop rice.

I had the grilled chicken chop rice at $4. The rice is not too fragrant and a little dry. Chicken chop is average. Soup is a little blend too. Portions are decent.

Prices very affordable here, starting at $4.

Chicken cutlet seemed to be their speciality and I might consider going for that next time.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100471045446290739173/reviews
jus t,5,A very hearty plate of chicken rice. Price is right on point at $3bucks a plate and adding $1 for the chicken wing if one so wishes for more chicken. There was a short queue on a weekday lunch however service was efficient and brisk. Chicken was crispy and tasty.. i did feel however that the rice could be improved to be tastier.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105327979180307355926/reviews

Timothy Low,5,This stall has been here since the 90s when I saw still schooling at Presbyterian High School. Very reasonably priced at $3 for the Lemon Chicken Rice and the hash brown is at an extra $0.70.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100257004218618252802/reviews
