Lokman Hakim,5,"Very nice food, you wouldn’t believe that they’re actually vegetarian. Definitely recommend. Special thanks to Adeline and Angela for being wonderful servers for my lunch meal 😊😊",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109332758682061053037/reviews
C I Leong,5,"I have been to Saute Sushi several times for special occasions especially when my friends from overseas came to Singapore for visits irregardless whether they are vegetarians. Every time when I visit Saute Sushi, it is nearly full, and every time I will definite enjoy my favourites : chawanmushi and the fried mushroom.
I am very comfortable with their service.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115447658254490304376/reviews
Goh Jia Hui,5,"Love their oatsome broth truffle ramen! Must mix the truffle into the soup for the truffle soup taste! Staff service is good too! Especially Adeline, she noticed that I was about to finish my food and served a couple of napkins! I also noticed her serving other customers with more in depth service than usual. For example, the customer asked for hot water, she asked if they wanted warm or hot, n they preferred it warm. But the menu only had hot so she went the extra step to give them warm water.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114218398521600102878/reviews

Wanida Kok,5,"We came here twice in 2 days - that’s how much we loved it. As a meat eater, this place tasted as close as it could get to authentic Japanese sushi. We were in awe of the vegetarian unagi roll and the truffle soup ramen - so amazingly delicious. Food gets delivered on a train so it’s somewhat entertaining.

Service is a little inconsistent - staff can be quite friendly and polite, but napkins aren’t always provided. So the little things made it a 4 instead of 5 for service.

$54 for membership gets you $70 worth of vouchers - not a bad deal.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105461298930858802129/reviews
