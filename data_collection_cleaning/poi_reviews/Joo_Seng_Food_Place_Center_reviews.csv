Winnie,3,"Mala price for 3 is OK at this coffee shop.   Good and tasty.  Get '2 chilli' cuz '3 chilli' is too spicy!  Prawns very fresh and we had 2 pkts of noodles. üòä

Never have the zhi char hor fun or beehoon - no wok keep taste.  Anything else is OK.

The ban mian stall is good. Dun have the fish head or fried fish.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105453921628996101695/reviews
Sohan Gurung (Gmss),5,"I have been going to Joo Seng Food Place Center for most of my life and was sad that they renovated. I used to love one noodle place that had very tasty noodles and spices. I was sad to see them go but maybe there are new ones? I don't know, but the new design looks neat and convenient. I'm still excited to come back and eat here again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104188256003162364038/reviews
kanojo2003,3,"Recommended to try the Áå™Ë∂¥Èù¢..
The noodles were cooked just good and tender, without the chilli was already very tasty. The chili was spicy and when mixed with the noodles, it gave another level of tastiness. The crispy cooked pork‚Äôs are everyone‚Äôs favourite. The dish was added with anchovies and some few vegetables which completed a well appetising meal.
The 2nd photo will tell you how I like the foods.. ha ha.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107820978264076955343/reviews
G,4,"Had the fish and chips and black pepper chicken chop with opening promotion (until 9 April). Food is freshly made to order and comes with a side of mushroom soup as well for the promotion! $12.80 for everything (U.P. $18.50).
Really like their whipped potato here although it would be nicer if it was hot like the proteins.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112916055706142007559/reviews
Who Care,5,"i ate at the noodle shop, the auntie was super nice she even offered me extra meatballs. The noodle was extremely good best one I've had so far, the price is reasonable as mostly all the worker go there. The atmosphere is like any old kopitiam.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115093646262071495762/reviews
