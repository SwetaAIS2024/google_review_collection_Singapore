      "text": "The Jurong Circular Bridge is a well-designed, wide bridge that earns a solid 4 out of 5 in my book. It’s a key link in the area, connecting Pandan Gardens with the International Business Park, Ulu Pandan Park Connector, and Faber Heights.\n\nWhat makes it stand out is how cyclist-friendly it is — the width gives plenty of space for both pedestrians and bikes, making it a smooth, safe crossing. Whether you’re commuting or out for a leisure ride, it’s a practical and pleasant part of the network. A great piece of infrastructure that really enhances connectivity in the West.",
