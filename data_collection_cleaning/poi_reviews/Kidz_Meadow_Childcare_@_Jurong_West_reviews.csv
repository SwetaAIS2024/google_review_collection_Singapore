Nurul Ain Afiqah Shariff,5,"My son is currently in Toddler B. He absolutely loves going to school to meet his teachers and friends! He has grown so much since he started school.

Recently we had a school trip to River Wonders and since my son has been learning about sea creatures, he was very excited to see the animals.

His teacher, Tr Nurul is very patient, bubbly and knowledgeable. We are very sad to hear that she’s transferring to another centre in the East. Nonetheless, I wish her good luck in the new center.

Thank you Tr Nurul, Tr Tse Er, Cikgu Seri & Tr Dhilah!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107638900595815230748/reviews
Adlini Sjah,5,"Chose Kidz Meadow for my son's school because I observed that the teachers seem to be genuinely having fun playing with the children in their outdoor sessions. Now my son is entering his third year - he has received care and attention, learnt a lot, and have many fond memories. We also receive detailed feedback at the end of the year on his growth and progress, as well as instant updates if any issue at school. Thank you to Teacher Joy, Cikgu Faizah, Teacher Maria, Teacher Nurul, and all the teacher assistants for your dedication and care for our children ☺️",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108619265213206893694/reviews

nur shahida,5,"Kudos to the care and teaching that was given to my child. I was afraid to leave him at childcare at first but the teachers there made it possible and try their very best to make my child feel welcome. I would like to comment to teacher nurul (his form teacher) especially for giving updates for his progress and always greeting us with her warm smile and cheery personality. I can feel her interest in teaching is very genuine. I feel at ease wherever i go to work leaving my child behind.

Thankyou once again to all the teachers that works at meadowjw…keep to up!

Landy Ng,5,"I have so many good words to put into the review of KidzMeadow Jurong West that it may possibly start sounding too good to be true. I would like to thank Teacher Nurul for her incredible passion & love that she has given my child & even us as parents. Sending your little baby to school is never easy but Teacher Nurul helped us feel that our child is safe, happy and constantly learning. I have never known or seen a teacher as nurturing & passionate about her job than her. I am truly grateful for all that she’s done! My kid is now 2 and can hold full on conversations with me. If there is some sort of award, I’d definitely nominate her with all my heart. The school has provided a safe haven for our kid while we work on our careers. I chose this school for its convenience and warmth it brought to us. We stayed in this school for all the love, joy & care they have given my child. Not enough words to explain how grateful I am for all the staff of KidzMeadow! Thank you for the year of your effort, knowledge & honesty. If you’re looking for a school  that eases your heart & mind while you’re busy at work, this one is definitely the right one :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116486686086016827530/reviews
