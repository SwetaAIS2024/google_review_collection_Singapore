Anne Thymotie,2,"The food is great, very big portion and reasonable price (for dine in). But the service is bad. The boss prefers to accept Grab order (because it is way expensive than dine in).",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104747298925393636918/reviews
EJ Montecillo,2,"dont waste time to come and dine here. You wont be served cause they prioritize grab deliveries. Went here 3 consecutive times and all denied. But to be fair, they serve mostly good food. If you are eager to try this out and willing to spend 5 sgd more per meal plus delivery fee and willing wait longer, then go for grab food.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116575167695083314520/reviews

Winnie Lu,2,"Went there at their stall at Kaki Bukit  to eat lunch with my colleagues. Purposely drive there to eat so the food will be freshly cooked but when we got there around 11:25am, they said we need to wait until 12pm as they are still close. (In their website, it shows open 11am for dine in) after waiting for few mins, auntie said that they are open for dine-in but they cannot accommodate us as they need to prioritize grab food orders first but they don't know what time it'll end. Just a waste of time going there. Just order from grab food.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109309151674610190702/reviews
Tatz GL,2,"I've ordered a couple of times through food panda for same day delivery and no issues-- the food were tasty and the servings were large. So, decided to order for a small celebration at home, a day in advance, still through foodpanda. On the delivery day however around 4:19PM (delivery sched was supposed to be at 5PM), I was notified that my order was cancelled. So disappointing. It would have been easier to accept if they cancelled in the morning, at least I had enough time to look for options. There's a refund of course, but then time was already wasted. Not sure if I will order again in the future. See how.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102373138173385206361/reviews
