Booking was easy, and the team was warm, helpful, and efficient. They resolved my problem quickly, and the waiting area was comfortable with complimentary drinks. I'm thoroughly impressed and will definitely return for future needs. Five stars for exceptional service!",

With CNY in 2 days time and most of the car wash shops / detailing shops closed/ fully booked , I was fortunate to get a car wash slot at SPARK Car Care (Sin Ming).\n\nCar is back to its shine again and Kudos to the team from  customer care to automotive technician for taking care of my ride.\n\nPleasant experience and look forward to returning again.",

It has been a seamless experience redeeming the Shopee voucher, booking an appointment, sending/collecting my car.\n\nThe resting area is good, with power supply and work desk, or tv with cushion seats if I want to relax. Light beverages is provided as well.\n\nDo note that it's also a servicing centre for their taxis. Do you will see a lot of blue vehicles inside.\n\nOnly feedback I have is the customer parking area. Do park at the area shown in the picture. I went to make a right turn into their staff carpark and was told by the security guard to turn out and enter again. There's wasn't any signage to guide me.\n\nUpdate: they managed to solve my rear window issue without changing the motor. I had a hard time trying to get my authorised agent to repair it even though I had warranty. Thank you Mr Koo for helping me!",
