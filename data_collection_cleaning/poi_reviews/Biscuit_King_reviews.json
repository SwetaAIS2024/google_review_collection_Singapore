Was still worth the trip! Bought many toys and games that I was fond of as a kid. They also had a wide variety of preserved fruits! Biscuits are sold at 300g, 500g and 1 kg.",

I then explained the other one seems to be the one I got the last time. She claimed her prawn crackers are replenished every few days so I bought both to try as I believed her that Bee Bee was nicer.\n\nWell, I opened both when I got home and Bee Bee was soggy and inedible probably due to air leakage so it went to the bin straight away.\n\nThe other one is nice and crunchy but feel upset that she would promote the ÊºèÈ£étype.",
