Cockles are THE must-try, which sauce can be cooked with noodles of your choice. Crabs and lala soup are also recommended!\n\nGreat service from Val too, friendly and always ready to answer all my queries. Thank youuu for the amazing food and service.",

      "text": "Not gonna review on the prices, just gonna review on the food.\nBought 450g L hums, mild spicy.\nAround 40 hums overall in the plastic container\nMarinated Sauce : 10/10. You'll love it if you're a lover of spice and garlic\nSpice : 10/10.Mild spicy is 150% which i think is perfect if you can take spicy food for the kick. I should be able to take 200% spice but think 150% is perfect to enjoy the hums without burning your tongue\nFreshness of the hums : 8/10. Tasted more fresher hums in Japan and high end restaurants but still good quality hums paired with the sauce and spice to make up for it.\nOverall: 9/10. Will definitely order it again once the cravings comes but definitely not healthy food you eat every week. Do not waste the remaining marinade sauce as you can still boil it to use as sauce for your pork belly slices or sauce for your plain porridge which i highly recommend",

For me i prefer my seafood to be hot. But overall it was a nice experience. Price is slightly on the higher end but definitely worth a try since the serving is bigger than normal and definitely worth a try.",
