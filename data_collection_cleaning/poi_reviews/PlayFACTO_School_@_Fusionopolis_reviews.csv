Grace Lee,5,"My son attended PlayFacto @ Fusionopolis for two years. PlayFacto created a comfortable environment for the children to rest, read and engage in various science / craft activities (alongside other enrichment boosters). The teachers were also very nurturing and caring about my son's development, both in terms of academics and character. I felt at ease with my son being there, knowing that he enjoyed himself and built great friendships!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107176970015087228500/reviews
jessica tong,5,"Dear PlayFacto Teachers,

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for your unwavering support and dedication to my child. Your passion for teaching and genuine care for each studentâ€™s well-being have created a nurturing environment where every child feels valued and inspired.

The way you tailor your teaching methods to cater to the individual needs of each student is truly commendable. My son has not only gained academic knowledge but also important life skills and values that he will carry forward. Your efforts have made a significant difference in his life and in our lives as well.

As today marks the last time my son will attend PlayFacto, I want to thank you for making his experience here so enriching and enjoyable. Your nurturing approach has helped him grow both academically and personally, fostering confidence and a love for learning.

Thank you for everything!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105923766842811182481/reviews
