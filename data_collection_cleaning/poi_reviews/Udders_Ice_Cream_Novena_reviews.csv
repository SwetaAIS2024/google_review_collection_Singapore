Whiskey Tea,4,"Newly renovated ice cream parlour . You have diverse flavor with the typical strawberry , vanilla, speculous, cookies and cream to the alcohol type which is rum and raisin , Baileyâ€™s .

What blew us off was the muah Chee flavor , similar and showcasing the local snack of peanut and mochi .

The Mao shan wang is wonderful according to the hubs but what was surprising was as the price for 2 scoops  $ 9.40 and you need to top up $5.80 for emperor Mao per scoop hence  for 2 scoops of king of fruit was a whopping $ 22 bucks .

What was eye catching was their water mountain , quite the artistic sculpture !",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111788781388191786320/reviews

Great ice cream with superb waffle. It was crispy and shiok.

Ok the ice cream is on the higher side but you get good quality n enviroment so it evens out in a way.

kian wee chau,5,"When it rains when you order, the waffle is only $1 with the purchase of 2 scoops of ice cream ($9). Great deal.
The waiter automatically helped to add hot water into my rose green tea hotpot without my request. Great service.

Jasminelcf,5,Great offer of buy 2 get 1 scoop free. Always the go-to place for premium liquor ice cream. The waffle is nice baked and it blends well with their ice cream. Too bad it is not a rainy day. Hehehe,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109850616937904701050/reviews
