There are multiple entry and exit points, so didn't feel too crowded anywhere. Maybe a few more seating options on the lower floor would be useful.",

Through the painting, it is easy to feel his strong emotions changing from time to time till he took his live in 1890 at the age of 37.\n\nHope you could get to see it, exhibition at limited time only.",
