YY,3,"Quite a decent meal despite the poor rating of 2.0 stars at the point of my review - but fair play as well since I witnessed the staff telling the customer ahead of me to tell her in advance should she wants to have her noodles non-separated, since their default is to separate the noodles and soup (though it wasn’t written anywhere).

🐠 the sliced fish was alright, but fried fish had a weird taste and wasn’t to my liking

At $6.80 there’s actually not much to complain, 6 slices of fish, I didn’t get a poor service and it’s an okay meal in general.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
Alvin,1,"I had a really bad experience with 猛龙泡饭王 at Bukit Batok Level 4 Koufu and will never buy from this stall again. When there were still three customers ahead of me, the cashier lady suddenly shouted, “What you want?” to take my order.

I told her, “1 x number 4 with noodles and 1 x number 12 with rice,” but the cook in front shouted back, “Don’t make it so complicated, just say how many mains, rice, and noodles you want.” It was totally unnecessary and rude, like they don’t even care about basic manners.

After I paid, I moved to the side to wait, but the cashier lady shouted again, “Go more to the side!” even though I was already standing quite far from the counter. Their behaviour was just ridiculous, like some Ah Beng opened this stall and hired people worse than uneducated.

There’s another stall called 猛龙龙虾王泡饭, and I really hope they aren’t related because I’ve seen bad comments about them too.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108647148608722084252/reviews
Alvin C,1,Finally found a one star food stall in Singapore. I tried the Yuan Yang fish soup paofan at West Mall Koufu and it was  a total disappointment. Fish over fried and fish not fresh. I will never come again.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102181790026215103000/reviews
Yap Ka Kit,1,"Worker was unhappy my small request of separating my fried fish to my bowl of pao fan and couldn’t fulfill my request. If such a simple request can’t be done then I don’t believe this stall should survive in the fnb space.

I believe if you want to yet your day ruined by this attitude of stall, then come and patronise",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105009938567579162843/reviews
