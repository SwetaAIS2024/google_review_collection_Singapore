MUNSHI M.,5,"A haven for craft beer aficionados and casual sippers alike. With a rotating selection of locally brewed beers that are as diverse as the crowd they attract.

You can bring your favorite dishes from nearby restaurants. Sometimes there's random potluck  organised by the regulars that everyone is welcome to try out!

Who are the regulars? a wonderfully eccentric bunch, often seem to be in their own world. But they know when to make way for newcomers to feel welcomed!

They may not look like friends, but they're bonded by a shared love of craft beer. They cheer when a tap runs out ‚Äî because they know that a freshly brewed keg is coming up.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115968008447713303866/reviews
Mike A,5,"This place is a gem. Welcoming ambiance, great service (unlike some other known breweries in the East,) and most importantly, a solid selection of tasty beers on tap and in cans. Prices are better than other similar spots around Singapore. You can bring in food in fact they encourage you to do so. Really enjoyed my first visit. Won't be my last.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111478329990389071006/reviews
Bow K. Techataveekijkul,5,"This cozy spot has 10 taps of local craft beer. The owner is super friendly and takes care of customers himself. Most patrons are regulars, and fun fact‚Äîthe owner is a cat lover! Back at the previous location, cats would greet customers, but now they stay home. üê±

If you‚Äôre into craft beer, you gotta visit this place!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111615442808341027410/reviews
Michelle Tan,5,"I‚Äôve been a regular at Locality Craft Beers for a while now, and it remains one of my favorite spots to unwind. Their rotating menu of craft beers ‚Äî with a strong focus on Singaporean brews ‚Äî is always refreshing and thoughtfully curated. Whether you‚Äôre a hophead or just curious, there‚Äôs always something new to try that supports local breweries.

The space itself is cosy, quiet, and unpretentious ‚Äî perfect for winding down after a long day. It‚Äôs the kind of place where regulars know each other by name, and newcomers are greeted with a smile. The owner is incredibly friendly and genuinely passionate about the beers he serves, which adds to the charm of the place.

If you're looking for a laid-back spot with great beer and even better company, Locality is it. Hidden Gem",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108501805492361601592/reviews
