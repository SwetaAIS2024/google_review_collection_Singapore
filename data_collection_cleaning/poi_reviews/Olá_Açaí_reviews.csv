kit,3,"Iâ€™m a regular here. but the staffs really need to start remembering order and be extra careful when making bowls?? 5 times I ordered no granola for my bowl, 2 times it will come with granolasâ€¦ once I alerted the staff again because Iâ€™ve had a few times where they would still PUT granola in my bowl despite saying no granola, and the staff gave me an attitude. ðŸ˜­",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105382776319006712935/reviews

Cindy Ong,5,"Delicious aÃ§aÃ­ bowl, with option to self-create. Generous ingredients and toppings. Fruits were fresh too.

Beverly Yeap,5,"Surprised by an incredibly generous portion for the price!! Acai itself tastes like most other acai but goodness me the portion filled 2 greedy people who already had lunch! Generous cacao nibs, granola and cookie butter!

For the price im not sure buying acai from the supermarkets is any cheaper...

Would make the trip to this neighbourhood outlet again :)",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115614739589758680584/reviews
