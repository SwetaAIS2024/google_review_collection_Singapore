      "text": "If I can choose zero star for review, I would. PRC shop worker has really bad attitude. I have directed lazada delivery to have their shop as collection point. She asked me to check the pin number for collection in SMS. I told her I do not receive any sms from ninja van. She said she cannot pass the delivery to me in a rude manner.\nAs i checked, she snatched  my phone away and search. I was stunned and took it back. So I said why she has to be so rude.  She said in that case, do not send any delivery to the shop and said if I am not happy I can complain and yet refused to give me her name. Although it is not necessary as she is the only worker there. I was really stunned by her ill mannered behaviour .\nIt was not my first encounter with her bad attitude that I feel she needs to be told off by her employer. I  will never patronise that shop forever.",

Owners don't go down to the stores anymore and just focus on expanding and hiring all these cbf with anybody that is not from China workers. Outlets are in punggol and 2 in jurong west",
