Witold Chudy,5,"Clean, with a nice homelike atmosphere. All amenities are as they should be. It's a perfect place if you want a pleasant and comfortable stay at a budget price. And the owners are both super friendly, and cute too :). They are the biggest asset of the hostel!",11 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116203910695682344/reviews
Nathaniel Alex,3,"Just about you suitable Hostel, however don't bring many boxes as you might have a hard time carrying it up stairs since there is no elevator. Air conditioner comes on only at 8pm to 8am the rest of the time you will have to use the fan in the room. Comfortable beds with it's own locker. Common restrooms were surprisingly clean and you get hot water. There is tea and coffee for 24 hrs but bread is only in the morning (starts at 8am - 10am). And also you will have to do your own dishes and keep them back in their proper place. Located at the corner of lavender street and Hamilton Road. And also NO SHOES ARE ALLOWED IN THE HOSTEL so you will have to walk barefooted (slippers are also not allowed). overall I think this is a good place to stay in for a few days and to not be spoilt by hotel room services.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113930642566412705970/reviews
