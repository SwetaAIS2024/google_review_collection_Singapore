Topped with a fried egg and cucumbers.\n.\nHas nice chewy soft tender crisp textures, with smoky grainy sweet salty meaty savoury vegetal spice eggy flavour.",

      "text": "The place is ok to dine in, there's even an aircon place.\n\nWe ordered 3 plain prata ($1.70 each), 2 egg prata ($2.70 each), mee goreng with no meat ($5.70, add $3 for beef or chicken), 10 satay plus ketupat ($1.20 per satay for beef, mutton or chicken, $1.30 per ketupat), 1 teh halia ($2). Sounded like quite a lot cause I broke down the prices one by one, but you can see for yourself in the photo. We wanted a light dinner, and the proportion was alright, but the price was not. It's too pricey to be $31.50 for only these.\n\nScores (purely based on taste and not taking price into consideration, which all scores would go down to 1 or 2 over 5)\nPlain prata: 3/5 - I'm ok that the flour is a little tough and chewy, but may not be elderly friendly. Definitely not the kind to go for if you like crispy prata.\nEgg prata: 3.5/5 - slightly better than plain prata in terms of flavour and texture with the help of egg.\nMee goreng: 4/5 - it's quite flavourful for a plain mee goreng with no meat, but some may find it spicy\nSatay: 2/5 - dad says mutton meat too tough. Chicken meat was lean, but ok for me.\nKetupat: 2/5 - hard, not steamed thoroughly?\n\nAll in all, likely will go back again if the standard is like this.",

There's a \"big\" piece of mutton but it's mostly bone with not much meat. Will be better if give more curry.",

The vegetable murtabak was the standout dishâ€”fluffy and generously filled with potatoes, onions, cauliflower, and button mushrooms. The mee goreng, though, was just average and didn't deliver the spiciness I was hoping for.",
