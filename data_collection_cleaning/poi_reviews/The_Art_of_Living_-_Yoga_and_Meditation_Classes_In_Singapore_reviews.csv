Mini Nautiyal,5,"I recently attended the 3 day Sahaj Samadhi program with Kavitha Ji. It was a wonderful experience and I have been doing my meditation every day since then. As a beginner, I feel deep mental relaxation and can feel a positive shift in myself. Kavitha Ji's teaching has been instrumental and she inspired me to be consistent with my practice. I am glad that I invested my time joining this course for my personal growth. Thanks Kavitha Ji!!  Jai Gurudev!!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109388211710449827185/reviews
Shirleen Grandgeorge,5,"When I signed up for the program, I thought I will only learn different breathing techniques, but in the end I learned so much more than I could imagine.
The entire course is very well planned. So many golden nuggets of wisdom. The exercises that we do during and after the day of the course really enhance the experience in the most positive ways.
The breathing techniques had me sleeping like a baby every night.
I highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to be happy and looking for a better quality of life",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108356060434402693617/reviews
Enrico Iannace,5,"Highly recommended for releasing the stress and living joyfully. It is worth it both in case you are freshener and in case you are repeating the courses.
I did the advanced meditation course with Kavithra. she taught me the technical skills to continue meditation on my own at home. Very happy with the entire experience !",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103533719016918190003/reviews
Yi ZHOU,5,"I had first yoga-meditation class under guidance of Teacher Kavitha on 22nd Nov afternoon. I learnt to relax every part of body, to live/breathe at present to clean the minds with meditation. Instead of looking for love externally, search it internally: You are the joy, peace and love. Yoga is a charger of life.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102003092491606599458/reviews
JL,4,"Attended the Happiness program for 3 half days. Glad that I have taken the first step to learn to be a more joyful person. The program taught us unique breathing techniques to reduce our stress, increase our energy level. Kavitha, the teacher has shared with us many life theories on how we could manage our interactions and connection with people better, how to be more positive thinking. I hope with consistent practice, I could be a better and calmer person and can spread to people around me.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104432505523146411524/reviews
