      "text": "Surprised there are little reviews on this kindergarten. I am glad I found a gem. At a school fee of $420/mth, my kids are getting what Montessori that cost $3000/mth may not even provide.\n\nAt first I did not have high expectations since proximity was my main concern. When I visited the school, it had a nice vibrant vibe with light wood laminated, good lighting, clean and creative environment .The principal was pleasant and I love that the main philosophy of the school is to nurture kid’s interest to learn which was good enough for me to sign up\n\nOnce enrolled then did I know I got more than a school. They use an app where it records check in and check out of my kids with photo and it’s interesting cos I can save those photos and keep a copy of their progress and I know they are in good hands since my helper send them. There’s a broadcast section on the app that allows teacher and parents communicate and they are always responsive. There is a portfolio section to update on the learning progress of kids with photos and it is interesting to see them in actions in school.\n\nThe teachers and staffs are lovely. There’s only one class per age group which makes it a very cosy environment. When my kids had chickenpox, Ms Rose their teacher kept checking in to make sure they are fine and they (Principal Mrs Woo and Ms Rose) even did a house visit\n\nMy K1 twins recently came back and told me they learned diagraph and diphthongs and I who is born ‘79 was shocked and ask them what dia what dip. I love their confidence level as they try to correct my pronunciation when I fall short on my ‘g’ when I say “bag” and their keen interest to learn.\n\nI am thankful that my kids are in such great hands.",
