Bright Eyes,5,"1st Visit:  I was there on Saturday 16 September 2023 with my nephew. We had lunch. He had Japanese Chicken Curry Rice and I had Grilled Salmon Salad. The meals tasted good coz the ingredients were fresh and the meals were freshly made. We enjoyed the meals. Will return another time for lunch again.

2nd Visit: I was there with my sisters on Thursday, 11 January 2024.  All of us had Grilled Salmon Salad. We all love ðŸ’• the lunch. It was so yummy.

3rd Visit: I was there with my ex university classmate. We had Grilled Salmon Salad. It was just so lovely. The greens were so fresh and the salmon was grilled well. We both love ðŸ’• it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114200783271279069230/reviews

Derek Chow,5,"This cafe nested at City Hub, 2 minutes walk from Bendemeer MRT station, serves delicious breakfast. Today tried their Garlic Toasts served with Beacons and Sunny Side Up Eggs, beverage is Ice Lemon Tea

All I can says that when I had a bite of the toasted garlic breads, itâ€™s crispy and the garlic butter tasted perfect! Goes very with the beacon too! Last but not least the ice lemon tea is refreshing!

Overall the whole experience was great! As well the service I give a thumbs up to a staff member by the name of Ker Bee Lay and the kitchen crew that had passionately prepared such delicious food for me today! Thank You!

Simple and yet satisfying! Strongly recommended.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100844270712697701469/reviews
Warren Ong,4,"Had breakfast and their food is above average. Taste wise, nothing out of the ordinary and would have preferred more egg in their egg mayo sandwich. Loh mai kai & side mai - nothing special, similar to bulk made and steamed for the mass. Kopi was good and strong.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100105413429653445829/reviews
