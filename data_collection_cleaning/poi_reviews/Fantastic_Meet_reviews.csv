z,5,"Newly opened eatery.
The hardcopy menu needs improvement. It currently features only photos and prices, lacking the crucial dish names.
The friendly waitress offered a coupon for a free iced lemon tea, which was a nice touch.
There's no GST or service charge, which is a plus.
The food itself is simple, consisting mainly of meat patties, rice, and lettuce. The free iced lemon tea made the meal worthwhile.""",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118374534282509950965/reviews
Yan Kei Chang,5,"5 Stars - A Hidden Gem in Novena!
Highly recommend trying the curry hamburger meat don â€” absolutely fantastic! The patty is perfectly fried, juicy on the inside, and drenched in rich, flavorful curry sauce that ties the whole dish together beautifully. The rice was fluffy, and the fresh lettuce and shredded cabbage added a nice crunch. Chef Lester is warm, welcoming, and clearly passionate about his food. A cozy spot with heart, flavor, and amazing hospitality. Will definitely be back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113778980389939701782/reviews
