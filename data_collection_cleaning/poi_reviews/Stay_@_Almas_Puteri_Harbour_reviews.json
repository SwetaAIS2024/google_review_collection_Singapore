Accessories vanished, and cables were cut, leaving my motorbike a mess. It's disappointing to see this happen here, making it feel no safer than known theft hotspots like KSL. If you're living here, please be extra vigilant with your vehicles.",

      "text": "To be actual this is not a hotel , so there will be no lobby for you to check in ,no room service. When you reach the suites building you will need to contact the staff who will bring the access card and key to you at the ground floor entrance  . The location wise is not convenient as eateries are less and most of the shops are vacant . You will need to drive out to eat , I don't know if getting private hired cars are possible as the district is far less than crowded .\n\nThe good point for this suite is that it's great for small family staycation if you are driving . The room layout which I stay is a twin queen size bed concept with kitchen , washing machine facilities .\n\nThe room is clean,tidy and neat . What I have to recommend is that the view when staying at high storey is magnificent. You can clearly see the west northern side of Singapore.\n\nAt the price of S$50+ through internet reservation and payment . This is a good choice for family stay.",

Nice gym and swimming pool.\nðŸ“ŒA lot of nice view places around can take picture and check in.\nðŸ“ŒBut the problem is no convenient store nearby, perhaps I didn't find it. So have to buy mineral water before u staying in.\n\nDefinitely will come back again next timeðŸ˜Š",
