She is very efficient as well, took down my request and issued queue number to me... within seconds. I was soon served by a counter staff when my number was called. She was another polite and efficient staff.  She handled form, notes smoothly, with a happy face and gentle speaking tone.  I am very happy with this experience w uob.",

And she was extremely knowledgeable with UOB prducts, explaining to me patiently and clearly about Stash and One accounts and other UOB accounts.\nI have ever enquired about Stash account with other UOB branches but still, i wasn't clear at all until I met Sharon today. She has left such a great impression and she really takes pride in her job and goes beyond her job scope. UOB should be proud of having Sharon in the team and she deserves to be commended. Thank you very much Sharon.",

None of the banks,  including other banks, I have visited has assigned a staff so warm and knowledgeable at the front desk. Subsequently, I was served by Quek Si Min at the counter, she was very professional, prompt and sincere. I truly enjoyed this UOB branch.",
