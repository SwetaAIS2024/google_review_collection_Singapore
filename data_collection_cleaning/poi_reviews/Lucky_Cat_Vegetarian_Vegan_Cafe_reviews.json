      "text": "very filling for a good price!\n\negg mayo onigiri: taste felt odd solely because i‚Äôm not used to the combination of egg mayo and rice. it was pretty filling (almost too filling) for an appetiser!\n\nshitake cream and cheese: this can never go wrong, classic taste super good! it was topped with chili sauce but was only super mildly spicy (coming from a low spice tolerant person)\n\njapanese curry katsu don: super good and filling! the katsu was crunchy and tasty while the curry was light and sweet (non spicy)\n\ntofunagi don: so so much vegetarian meat in the bowl, definitely worth the price! it was crunchy and has abit of a bitter aftertaste\n\naonori fries: salted nicely with seaweed flakes ! super big portion (the picture doesn‚Äôt do it justice)\n\noverall the food here was super good and really worth the price due to its taste and portion size! ordered so much for only around 30sgd!",

      "text": "The service was AMAZING!!! When we arrived around 6.30pm there was already a long Q. The food came pretty fast. We really enjoyed the sashimi, tasted like the real thing, that we had a 2nd helping. The shitake cream & cheese sauce was very delicious but the dough a little thick. The tofunagi maki was the best dish. It was crispy & delicious. The noodles in the soup was a lil soggy, might be better with ramyeon instead. I enjoyed the curry katsu don, but my dining partner felt the jap curry sauce a lil sweet, but the katsu was really well done! The dining area was cosy & though it was crowded, it didn‚Äôt felt too noisy. It was a pleasant ÂçÅ‰∫î dinner!",

So vegetarian but a lot of deep fried stuff and sweet sauces.\nHence can be still not that healthy.\n\nAnyway nice. Delicious enough for me.\n\nService is good. Beverages nice!",
