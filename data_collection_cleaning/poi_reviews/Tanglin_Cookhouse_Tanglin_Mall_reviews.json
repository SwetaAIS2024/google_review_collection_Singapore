      "text": "For a taste of classic Western dishes with a unique local flair, Tanglin Cookhouse delivers both in flavor and value. The Hainanese Pork Chop was recommended by a young a gentleman, Godwin as we were overwhelmed by the choices available. It was amazing and live up to its chef recommendation. Despite the large afternoon crowd, service was amazing. Kudos to Godwin and the team for making our lunch enjoyable. Will visit again in the near future to try other dishes!",

Changed the sides to salad instead of fries and glad that they allowed this .\nPork chop was flavourful.\nMushroom soup was a tad salty for my liking.\n\nWe shared a Dessert, the ondeh cake. Everyone liked it.  The coffee was a strong brew which I really enjoyed. Overall a great meal indeed.\n\nHighlight of the meal was the impeccable  service. Server Gabby was constantly making sure all was good. She even asked if she should serve the coffee during lunch or after the meal.",
