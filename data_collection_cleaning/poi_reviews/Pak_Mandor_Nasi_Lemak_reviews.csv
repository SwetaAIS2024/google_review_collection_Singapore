Muhamad Riduan Borhan,4,Green Nasi lemak is flavourful. Comes with fried chicken or fish(selar) begedil fish cake peanuts and ikan bilis. Only issue is sambal thou nice but not spicy. HDB carpark plenty. I however not in favour of share dining areas with smoking area. Always a Q but service is fast.

MNG,5,"Distinctively green colored rice which was well flavored with coconut milk. Neither to mushy nor hard.

Fish fillet was of good quality and flavorsome.

Chicken wing was marinated well, mildly spiced.

Chili was medium spicy and balanced and not overtly sweet.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews

Alvin Choo,4,"Found out about this place through Alderic's YouTube channel. I previously came on a Saturday but they were closed that day. Decided to make a trip back since I was clearing leave.

They have quite a few ingredients and the only ones I didn't get were the fishcake, chicken cutlet and fish fillet. Thus, what you see in the photo will be chicken wing, fish, egg, tempeh, sausage, bergedil and ikan bilis. These ingredients were quite average and they had been sitting at the counter for a while.

What I really liked was the rice and sambal. You definitely need to try the rice on its own before mixing it with any other thing. It has the classic nasi lemak taste and fragrance not commonly found at other nasi lemaks nowadays.

If I could, I would just buy their rice, sambal and ikan bilis, and use these to eat with other ingredients.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
