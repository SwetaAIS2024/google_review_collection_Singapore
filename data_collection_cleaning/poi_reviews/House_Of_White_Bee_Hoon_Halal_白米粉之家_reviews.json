A must try for those dine in here.\nFor the ppl talking about flies, kinda cant be avoided as the area is near the sea.\nBonus point is, sea view look nice, like east coast feeling.\nI would gladly dine in here again.\nThe waiters was friendly and professional. This is based on my experience. Ty for reading my honest review.",

Even the Mala has the kick but isn't that numbing so it was easy to the stomach as my breaking fast meal.\n\nDid an online order and picked up at the selected timing, and it was all ready. Still hot.",
