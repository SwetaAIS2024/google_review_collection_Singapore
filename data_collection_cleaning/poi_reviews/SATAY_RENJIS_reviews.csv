Pamujo,1,Assalamualaikum. Was there yesterday night but the stall was nowhere to be found. Asked around they said closed for today and other days but the website say otherwise. Very disappointed outcome as buying for and visiting someone who is unwell. Please update even it a last min closed. As some of us are NOT from anywhere near. Regards.
