I saw a similar concept in Hong Kong but honestly, I prefer this one in singapore given decent shops the place managed to consolidate.\n\nThere are restaurants, brunch places, coffee places, cold storage, retail and yoga classes. Definitely worth checking this place out.\n\nNote : parking is limited and can be hard to secure during weekend",

There are lots of nice stores, art studios, and few of food options, plus a supermarket. The outdoor spaces are great for hanging out with kids and pets. Just a heads up—it's probably best to visit on a sunny day since the outdoor areas wouldn’t be as enjoyable in the rain.",
