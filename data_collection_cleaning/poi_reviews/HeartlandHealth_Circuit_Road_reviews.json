What's the point of having a clinic that's not helping and not affordable prices at all , If the clinic willing to help people why not adjust the pricing First instead of taking tons of moneys just like that frm people who are sick and need attention .",

      "text": "Went to the clinic on the 22nd Dec, the staff there at the counter were decent, it's just the doctor on charge that day, whom namely was Fairuz or smtg that served me, he was obnoxious and told me that the flu test or something was $40. I was skeptical but didn't go with it, he said things like it's my problem if i didn't go, and things like saying it's my money not his. Given his attitude and serving etiquette, if you're so unhappy about serving patients whom is ill, and is your job, why not just don't. Remember there was a chinese doctor, Dr Wong was way better and this doctor's attitude could be improved. Add on, the medicine here are way overcharged. If I did approve the flu test that doctor was giving me, would have easily went above 100$ for everything. Couldn't blame thjs clinic but to blame SG and inflation but this doctor's attitude left a lot to be desired.",
