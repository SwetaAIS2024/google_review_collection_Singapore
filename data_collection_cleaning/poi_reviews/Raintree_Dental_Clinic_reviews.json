The staff was incredibly professional, understanding, and accommodating, and they got me in to immediately place my veneer back in an emergency procedure looking better than before. I highly recommend them to anyone seeking exceptional dental care. Thank you so much for taking care of me during my stay in Singapore!",

Dentists are skilled, detail oriented, and gentle. They did a good job. So are the assistants and other staffs. Reception staffs are friendly and personalized, made efforts to remember your face, name and background. During first consultation, dentist did detailed & thorough check & teeth cleaning. For my teeth cavity filling, i was surprised that the anaesthesia injection doesn't hurt much compared to my previous experiences. The injection + drilling+  filling process is generally painless & quite smooth. Pleasant with the results too. Recommended.",
