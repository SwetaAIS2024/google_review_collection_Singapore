Anqi,5,"L’Arte Pizza & Focaccia
Their rectangular pizza crust is crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside—absolutely delightful!
With a wide variety of flavors to choose from, you really can’t go wrong with any option.

Tartufata
Loved the white sauce truffle cheese—rich, creamy, and aromatic!
Paired with ham and arugula, it’s a perfect combination.

Pepperoni
The tomato-based red sauce gives it a juicier bite, with gooey, stretchy melted cheese.
The pepperoni adds a bold, savory flavor to the mix.

Margherita
A simple yet classic choice!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103942786278480325983/reviews
Q T,4,"slightly pricey, would probably amount to $20+ per person. no seating available, but there are free to use table and chairs in the vicinity. wonderful service from a female staff manning the storefront (sorry didn't catch your name!)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116925287024075610624/reviews
D333,4,"I had a great experience at this pizzeria! The crust is the star of the show—super crispy, perfectly baked, and full of flavor. High quality of their ingredients. However, I do wish the portions were a bit larger for the price($8 before GST for 1 slice). It felt a little small for what I paid, but the taste definitely made up for it. If you're a fan of crispy crust, this place is worth checking out, just keep in mind the portion sizes. Overall, still a solid choice for pizza lovers!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109309444988377295324/reviews
WenD Tan,5,"Went today lunch time, no queue and had nice slices.

Went on a fri evening (no seating as the restaurant opposite them has full use of the tables) - they recommend going daytime instead. There’s also some open air seating upstairs

Nice pizza and pricing is ok.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109536932994130185088/reviews
Sleepy Sleeping,5,"The pizzas were simple yet delicious. You can order any flavor available on their menu, and they will bake it for you if it's not on display. You can buy a whole pizza or by the slice.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109760210623455273641/reviews
