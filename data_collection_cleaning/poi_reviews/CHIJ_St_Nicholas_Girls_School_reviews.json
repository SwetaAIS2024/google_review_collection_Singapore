      "text": "this school is so awesome!!! I remember on a Tuesday evening, I was wandering the halls around the third floor waiting for my friend when I suddenly caught a glimpse of a big scaly creature! I got curious and decided to follow it. It kept twisting and turning around the endless St. Nicks corridors, and a thunderous stomping could be heard as it made its way into the school bathroom. When I opened the door, a wall of pond stench hit me like a brick. It reeked of fish water and I could make out a soft gurgling of water. I knocked on the third stall three times (mind you, it was the third floor) and asked if Hanako-san was present. To my horror, the door unlocked itself and creaked open. There, I saw a translucent figure; dark green with a spiky silhouette, drinking water out of the toilet bowl. It lunged at me, and it was then I realised, that was the ghost of the old school crocodile! Luckily, the announcement for us to get out at 6:30 was playing. The crocodile vanished and I immediately ran away, swearing to never enter that toilet again.",
