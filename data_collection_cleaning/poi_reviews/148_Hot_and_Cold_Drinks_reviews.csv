CP,5,I am always amazed by how long the queue is for this coffee stall and I decided to join the queue this time. The verdict is the coffee is awesome. The brewing of local coffee looks simple but somehow the outcome is never the same and hinges on many factors including TLC that is put into brewing the coffee. The coffee here has that nice coffee aroma and punch (and it is not a given as many places are just bitter and missing that coffee aroma). I read the toast and egg here is good which I will definitely be back to try them.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
Terence Tan,5,"Served very good local coffee. Usually snake queue of people waiting patiently for their turn to order.

Today I try kopi Kosong to get a better taste of the coffee. Frankly, I would prefer to have it with sugar and or milk.

Still good lah, cause I can still drink it even without sugar.

80 cents for a cup of black coffee is very cheap already.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107525131369857002446/reviews

Ride Bike,5,"Best Coffee, best toast egg, best service award should go to this stall. Even with the inflation, this stall still maintain a reasonable price for the neighborhood. Kopi O kosong $0.8c where to find in SG. And kopi is thick not diluted for selling low.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108071262381190749028/reviews
