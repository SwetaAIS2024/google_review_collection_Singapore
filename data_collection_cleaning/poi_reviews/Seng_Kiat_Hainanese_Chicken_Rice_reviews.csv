Spice N' Pans,5,"We're so addicted to their roasted chicken rice. The chicken is beautifully marinated, tender, and packed with flavours. The rice is fragrant and perfectly cooked. Best of all, you can still get a pack for just $3. There's always a long queue, so be prepared to wait about 10 minutes, but it's well worth it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117490901465936089819/reviews
Jacob TAN,5,"Our favorite roasted chicken rice stall in Singapore. The roasted chicken is tender and very tasty. The char siew here is amazing with a good mixture of fats and lean meat and is very tender. The taste is sweeter compared to most other places.
The chicken rice is aromatic and the rice is perfectly cooked. However, it is a little oily and that is what prevents the rice from sticking together.
A queue usually forms by 11 am but the line moves quickly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews

üìç4 Defu Lane 10, Singapore 539214

üçú Food wise: Decent chicken rice around! It was cheap and delicious! They were generous about the portion of the meat, big slices of chicken, not too dry and pretty tender. Was told that this was one of the best food in this block. One can tell why indeed. The chili was quite nice too, pretty good!

‚ú® Ambience wise: Spacious and big canteen!

Sean Goh,4,"Got to know of this chicken rice stall on my previous trip to try the wanton noodle stall right next to it. Seems like a popular stall as there was long queue for this chicken rice stall. Happen to pass my this area and was craving for chicken rice and decided to give this stall a try.

Reached the stall slightly before 12pm and was greeted by the familiar long queue. There was at least 15pax ahead of me, but it moved pretty fast.

Ordered roasted chicken breast with charsiew. Cant remeber how much i paid. Rice was frangent and not too oily. Most importantly the rice was flavorful and fluffy. Had the roasted chicken breast, it was flavorful and wasnt dry. The charsiew was quite good as well. Chili sauce quite spicy but goes well with meat and rice.

Overall, the chicken rice is pretty good and would highly recommend.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Sophia Liao,5,"Chicken rice only at $3, cheap and delicious.

The texture of rice is chewy and fluffy. The rice is very fragrant, with a little spicy flavor from ginger. Aftertaste is also pleasant.

The most popular stall at the center. A short queue during peak hours.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100308356151410117695/reviews
