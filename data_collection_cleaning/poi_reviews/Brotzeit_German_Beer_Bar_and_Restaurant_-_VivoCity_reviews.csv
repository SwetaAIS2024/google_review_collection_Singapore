LP Pua,5,"I made a reservation at this restaurant because of their advertised affordable lunch set. At the restaurant, the lunch set menu was not served by default, and we had to ask for it. Each lunch set came with a drink and had an option to add a salad or soup. Our party of 10 ordered different items, and everyone enjoyed their meal. The service was prompt, the seats were comfortable, the view was good, and the atmosphere was great. Overall, we enjoyed the lunch.

Daniel Cheoh,4,"Sitting outdoors turns out to be very nice. Came for dinner just the 2 of us. Food was good, fish n chip was very juicy. Ribs was very different from the American version, less sweet and more saucy. Will bring a bigger next time to try their platter.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105105070033709429432/reviews

Asia Apparel,5,"Been here for countless of time in near 20 years that the previous review can no longer be found. This is our favorite place for good German beer, sausage and rosti! Today came for a simple lunch. Surprise they have affordable value for money weekday lunch set. Enjoyed the short lunch.
