Andy Ang,1,"The staff named Fu was standing in the cooking area to take our order, supposedly there should be someone who takes the order at the counter and I told my wife for sure he would take our order wrongly. Under my prediction, 3 of our orders were wrongly cooked. We ordered 3 ketchup sauce noodles but it came with black sauce and the food is very oily. We can feel that Fu was impatient and rude to us by using his eyes to signal and make us guess what we should do next. I wanted to feedback so that the management can do proper training for the staff.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105611146976328920903/reviews

wei K,5,"Came back for 2nd visit. The liver is cooked consistently!! I like the liver, cooked just right. Glad I asked for chili to be separated from liver, don't really like the chili paste. Noodles in flavourful dark sauce is tasty, springy noodles. Pleasantly surprised they gave a bowl of soup. Overall satisfying meal, will return for second visit. Generous with the lard, but it is not crispy/ turned soft. Guy at the counter taking order is friendly and efficient. Thumbs up!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112531056212914057231/reviews
IngSoon Tan,1,"I can sense the atmosphere in the stall is very tense. The staff was less friendly like before. The queue was exceptionally long as counter staff appear to be new, and struggling to take orders promptly. Eventually, I became a victim to bring back home 4 packages of pork liver noodle. When I unpack the noodles, I became the happiest person since I am the only one in the family that eat pork liver. You can imagine the sulking expression on my family member. Hahahaha ðŸ˜† ðŸ˜…",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113159177526699241802/reviews
Allen Lee,4,Ordered one of the signature from the menu. The meat ball noodle. Amazingly the meat ball is soft and Really yummy. I really like it. This is something different than other stall meat ball. Should try it out and highly recommended. Will try the others next time.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103344279283666478021/reviews
