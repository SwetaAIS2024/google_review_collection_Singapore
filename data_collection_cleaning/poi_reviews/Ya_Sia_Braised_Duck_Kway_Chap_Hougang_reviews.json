Very generous with the noodles.\nThe pig trotters also soft and tasty even though bought quite early in the morning. They must have cooked it very early I. The morning.\nService here is good.",

      "text": "Never expect this Kway Chap store to serve up one of the nicer ones I have had for a while. The kway broth has a tinge of herbal taste which brings a bitter sweet aftertaste. I ordered $11 portion which comes with 2 bowl of kway and a good portion of braised tofu, taupok, pork belly and intestines (I opt out of pig skin since I’m not a lover). For the price, it definitely was value for money. Each portion of the food is nicely marinated with the braised sauce, not too salty or sweet with the right balance. Overall, standard for this store is a thumbs up for me.",
