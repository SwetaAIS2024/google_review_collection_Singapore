      "text": "The Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman Temple, located at 555 Serangoon Road in Singapore's Little India neighborhood, has a rich history dating back to the 1830s. Here's a brief overview¬π ¬≤ ¬≥:\n- *Early beginnings*: The temple is believed to have started with a picture of the goddess Kaliamman under a banyan tree near the current site. A female devotee placed the image, marking the beginning of the temple's history.\n- *Development and renovations*: In 1935, Mr. Rengasamy Mooriyar transformed the area into a complete temple and conducted the first consecration ceremony. The temple underwent several renovations, including significant changes in 1969, when architects from India redesigned the temple, and in 2015, with a $2 million renovation.\n- *Key figures*: Notable individuals who contributed to the temple's development include Mr. B Govindasamy Chettiar, a philanthropist and pioneering figure who served as the main contractor of the Singapore Harbour Board, and his nephew S.L. Perumal, who funded the construction of a new main tower and the present temple structure.\n- *Architecture and features*: The temple showcases Dravidian architecture, with a distinctive vimana (stepped pyramid-shaped tower) adorned with images of deities. The mandapam (main hall) houses the main shrine dedicated to Kaliamman, with smaller shrines for Murugan and Ganesha.\n- *Current status*: Today, the Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman Temple is a renowned Hindu temple in Singapore, open daily from 6 am to 9 pm, with morning and night prayers. The temple also features a Shirdi Sai Baba mandir and hosts various cultural events and activities.\n\nThe temple's history reflects the contributions of many individuals and the evolution of the temple over time, making it a significant cultural and spiritual landmark in Singapore.\n\nGKC...",
