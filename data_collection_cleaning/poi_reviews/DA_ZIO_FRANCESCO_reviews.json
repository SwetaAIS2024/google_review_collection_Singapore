Also, the restaurant is incredibly clean, and they are very particular about hygiene and cleanliness!",

We ordered the Christmas special chicken, lasagne and calamari.\n\nMy goodness, to start, I was thoroughly impressed and FLOORED by the lasagne. It was DELICIOUS and one of the best lasagnes I have ever had. The calamari was fresh and the accompanying sauce was a great coalescence of flavor.\n\nI would highly recommend trying the lasagne and the calamari!",

We even received a complimentary dish! It was delicious. Next, 10/10 for food. The portions is worth it for the price and the taste is really good . Would recommend the seafood risotto. Lastly, 10/10 atmosphere , it  was really cozy and there were paintings painted on the wall of the views you would see in Italy.Pretty and cute decorations too! The chef is the mother and she was really pretty and friendly. She came out to talk to the customers. We were given a cake which was a special Italy cake, should be on the menu. Overall would definitely recommend and I will definitely be coming again from Singapore.",
