Bhaskar Singapore,4,"Biggest and nearest to Changi Airport and attached to IT parks and Changi Business Park

Wide varieties of store collection, ranging from food to electronics. Apparels to Groceries.

This mall has one of the finest wine and liquor shops in the city.

All travellers missed shopping local food and can plan shopping and dining here as it's a few minutes away from the airport.
