missyKATAK,1,"Snobbish for no apparent reason to customers. And sardine epok is literally just onions!
Do not patronise. Not worth every penny support other seller selling epok epok.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109710305106892773449/reviews
joan muk,2,"I've been buy epok epok for years from this stall, and was always amazed that both pastry and fillings were just so good. Today, I realised the stall had some changes and the price increased to $1 per puff, the epok had changes too. The pastry was completely different. I would happily pay to have the old epok epok (one tt was hand pressed by auntie). This current pastry spoils the entire experience. Fillings were still generous and flavourful though.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110277299727876308938/reviews
RH,2,"Quality has gone down since what seems to be now factory-made skin. Iâ€™m fine to pay the increase (from 0.60>0.80>$1) but for this quality, itâ€™s not worth anymore. The new generation of owners should honour the legacy of the old. There is a reason why the puffs were nice when it was handmade.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118212350280681800595/reviews
Valerie Tang,2,"Always a fan for this Yang epok since covid days. But my last try from Bedok (original stall) disappointed me. Despite the size and price changed (not so important for a foodie), it's the taste that is totally gone.
I guess those regulars will understand what I meant.
I won't say the puffs now doesn't taste good, it could be your flavour. And I may also patron for snacking if there's no comparison.
Truthfully hope that the old taste can come back soon.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104524217880736580379/reviews
Shzrl,4,"Arguably one of the best genuinely-handmade epok-epok around. The epok-epok were freshly fried. If you like crispy epok-epok, this is a must have! Flaky, crunchy yet feeling light in the mouth. The fillings were reasonably filled too. Both potato & sardine options were well-marinated & tasted awesome ðŸ¤¤ Oh did I mention it costs only 60cents/piece? Bang for buck definitely.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101271227294867994383/reviews
