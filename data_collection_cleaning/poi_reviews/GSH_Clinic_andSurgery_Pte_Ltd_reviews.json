      "text": "Very meticulous and thorough doctor that is willing to listen attentively. Such a rare gem these days‚ú® would support him even if he moves to a further location! Keep it up! Also, shout out to the friendly receptionist (younger) who helped to secure my hospital appointment at an earlier date! Suggestion: as much as possible, customers that booked at specific time should be prioritised to enter at that time(no longer than a 10 min wait), rather than walk ins. There is a reason why we booked at that time and have scheduled our later events accordingly. I have 2 not so fantastic experience and felt it wasn‚Äôt very fair and respectful to customers that booked and blocked out our time for the clinic sessions. Receptionists should try to manage expectations with walk in customers and not over promise that they are the first etc, this should be subjected to the customers who already booked days ahead. Other than that, I had very friendly and pleasant experience with the team! The younger receptionist has an amazing memory and knows my family- amazing! ü§©",

I was very sick and had covid. The other client was unhappy that I sat next to him, and your front desk girl blamed it on me to be sitting next to him. I left after waiting for more than 30 mins because I was too ill to pick a fight and needed better care and attention. Not to mention, before that your girl also asked me to go home and take a new test kit from my home to prove I have covid. I went to a different clinic after and realized all this was unnecessary. Total waste of time for a sick person.",
