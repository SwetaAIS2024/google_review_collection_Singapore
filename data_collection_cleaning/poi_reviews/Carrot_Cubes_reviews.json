      "text": "Just takeaway yuanyang $6 since got craving. Portion is decent for a light lunch for me and my wife to share. This is my 2nd visit after a long break. As honest n objective review as it gets. Stall is only 200m+ from my house n it gets a little bias from this and a round up to 4 stars cos there is no 3.5.\n\nTried them before at AMK it was probably a good experience but not outstanding to leave an impression that needs a revisit. Hard for me to travel so far just for hawker food unless outstanding level.\n\nIt is still quite a big gap from my all time favorite stall by the late Mdm Tan at 327 Hougang Av5. It is a big loss to all around the neighbourhood from her passing last year. My next best is at Kovan hawker Weng Huat.\n\nCarrot Cubes is acceptable for my convenience. Nice cozy not too crowded kpt, seat outside no smoggy experience. I woke up late today so unable to make the trip to kovan. On a sunday 1pm was quite sad to see no Q and friendly ladyboss was taking a short break sitting down.  I can see she put in effort to fry my order. Stalls in this kpt just seem to struggle since its opening many came n gone.\n\nPrices here generally marginally higher due to new estate n rental, there has never been a stand out stall that can pull in the crowds n drink standard below par possibly a reason thats y i always prefer to takeaway.\n\nI will definitely support this stall more in view of this difficulty to get crowds and also nearby for me. Those who stay nearby should just forget about eating the carrot cake stall at Blk 401 kpt. That stall does it pre-fried and put aside leaving chance for flies to land on it. Then when have order they fry abit more before serving. My friend jokingly calls that stall instant chai tao kway stall becoz they make it the fastest for that reason but then also never ate it again lol.\n\nDo lend your support for Carrot Cubes so they can remain around for as long as possible.\n\nOn a side note there is the likelihood of \"friendly reisdents\" the chickens that frequent around. Also a similar experience i faced and enjoy at the most legendary carrot cake stall at Yishun Ring road that sells only white with a minimum waiting time of 30min to 1hr+ no matter what time or day u visit. Unbeatable quality and yummy and good value hence the Q time.\n\nHope to see Carrot Cubes do well here in the long term. I will definitely patronise it more often.",
