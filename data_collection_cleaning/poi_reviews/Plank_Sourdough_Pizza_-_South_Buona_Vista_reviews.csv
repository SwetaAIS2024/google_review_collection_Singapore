Calbee Cracker,3,"Pleasant tasting sourdough pizza. Generous topping. Would prefer if the crust is crispier. Tomato base on pizza is sweet instead of sour. Can see the real cherry tomatos in the sauce, so not those puréed type. Order at the cashier of Baker and Cook.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110229110724135670872/reviews
Robyn Leong,4,"Plank has many branches across the island, and I've yet to find a branch that wasn't satisfactory. Get the pizzas, the pastas are good but not mind-blowing.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106215556907173519307/reviews
Lis R.V,2,"Sourdough chicken BBQ pulled pizza was not up-to my expectations. Chicken smells funny, maybe it’s a frozen chicken, pizza base is ok I guess. The Bolognese pasta too sour for my liking lacking of umami taste. The only good thing was fries, chicken tender and beer.  Need improvement.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101951876949402488844/reviews
Dian Elvira Rosa,4,Well made pizza with chewy sourdough base. A tiny but burnt on the bottom part but overall pretty good. On the more expensive price range for a pizza.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116532935197924729271/reviews
Chai Teo,4,"Loved the tzatziki so much we had to ask for more.
