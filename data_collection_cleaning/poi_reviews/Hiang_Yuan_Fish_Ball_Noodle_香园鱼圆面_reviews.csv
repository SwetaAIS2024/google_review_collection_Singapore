Sean Goh,4,"One of the popular stalls within West Coast Market that serves fishball noodle. Came down a few times wanting to try but unfortunately, the previous 2 attempts were unsuccessful as they were sold out by the time I reached. I was greeted by a long queue when I reached, however it moved pretty fast. Apart from the fishball noodle, they also sell meatball noodle. The price of the noodle starts from SGD 4 onwards.

The noodle was nicely cooked; texture of the noodle was springy. Noodle was on the oily side.  My bowl of noodle came with ingredient such as sliced fishcake, fishball and meatball. The meatball which were homemade tasted not only delicious, it also has a good texture. The soup that they gave was not bad too, just a little too peppery.

Overall I enjoyed the noodle especially the meatball, I think I will order the meatball noodle instead.  Besides that, I would also request for less oil the next time I eat because it got a little towards the last few mouth. I would still recommend to give this stall a try.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
D L,5,"2025: not much queue at 630a.m. other times are really crowded. Tomato and chilli sauce is good. Meatballs are good.

2024:
The fish balls noodles is nice. The sauce and the soup are good. Texture of noodle is just nice.

I really like the meatballs and would order just meatballs in future

Marcus Goh,4,"Stall opens early with queue, queue moves slowly but surely. Meatballs irregular in size, likely handmade.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105182234976754893762/reviews
Yong L,4,"This stall starts business early, so if you need a quick breakfast early this is an option.

Fish ball noodle(mee pok dry) tasted just like an authentic recipe, not any modern day fusion style, just the plain old authentic recipe which I have enjoyed it.

As of Sep 2024, prices for small bowl is at $3.50.
So what small portion, might not be filling for one, especially males who require more food.

Queue line can be quite a long one, moving but slowly.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107225568265737125930/reviews
GH,4,"Fishball more of factory made . Noodle sauce evenly mixed (a little oily) though I would like a tinge more vinegar and more kick in sambal .

Uncle put in effort to always garnish w spring onion .

Overall, nice work .",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101252855469598813164/reviews
