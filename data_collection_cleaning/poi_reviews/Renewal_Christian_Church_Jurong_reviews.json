As a family, we were comforted by your prayer and kind words. You've helped us remember that even though she's gone, her angel is always watching over us. We also thank all members' visits from Renewal Christian Church. Our family felt so blessed by you and all your team members during the last few weeks. Thank you and God Bless!!",
