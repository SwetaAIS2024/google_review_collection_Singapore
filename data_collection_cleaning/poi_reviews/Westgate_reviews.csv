Michael Joel Mawikere,5,"Nice mall. It is in Jurong East. Many choices of food. The parking is pretty difficult. The area is not often traffic jammed. The mall is anlso child-friendly because the toilets are low. The mall comprises a 7-floor mall and a 20-floor office.  It features amenities such as a childcare center, a gym, swimming pool and Westgate Wonderland. Walk through the bridge and there are shuttles to IMM. Mostly, it is a place to buy your goods.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110185022401059709772/reviews
suzen,4,"Thks to my friend who recommend this Shanghai eatery. Always like to try & eat at differ eatery's xlb. And tot that this Shanghai eatery is same as at Raffles Shopping. Cos the word - Wang Fu is a very common name.

Luckily the lady boss told us that theirs is one & only eatery at our little red dot. And that day was their first day opening. Without awaiting much in queue, just walk-in & got our table. Their xlb is simply too delicious ðŸ¤¤",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110813622133166743966/reviews
