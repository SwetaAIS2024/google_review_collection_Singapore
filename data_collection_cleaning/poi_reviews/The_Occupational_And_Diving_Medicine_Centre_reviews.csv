Shubhankar Ambike,5,"To reach the centre, go inside the main UHC entrance (the one where an appointment machine is kept), go through the room towards a door on back side where the Dental clinic arrow is pointing. Go through the gate, and find the stairs on the back to the left after entering the door. Go to the level B1 and youâ€™ll find the centre name written on the glass door on left.
The staff is very helpful and friendly.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107591766958824131423/reviews
Edwin S,5,"The centre is linked to the main UHC building. It mainly serves the more specialised tests, such as eye examination for license applications.

For some of the exams, it will be conducted at an external partner clinic. In such a case, they will arrange your time slot and you would just need to report to the partner clinic at the stipulated timing.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113192406653516830642/reviews
