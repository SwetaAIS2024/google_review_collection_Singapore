Wan Leng Toh,1,"Peak dining hour on a Friday, and the mall decides to fully close toilets at level 1 and cut off the water supply at level 2. Could see most patrons making their way from Serene Centre to Cluny Court for the (really upscale and clean) toilets.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113730293675294723214/reviews
Saifu Angto,4,"A small complex at the corner of Bukit Timah Rd and Farrer Rd with a selection of food providers on the first floor - McDonalds, Guzman Y Gomez, Killiney Kopitiam, Ohr Gao Taproom, etc.  Upstairs there are a mixture of shops - Decofix DIY Store, a florist, dry cleaning, a few medical providers, etc.

It's across the street from Adams Road Food Centre and a short walk from Botanic Garden.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
Dan Ho,5,Quaint and charming little mall. Many eateries and cafes. Filled with tuition and enrichment Centers. Many high schoolers studying at the 24h macdonalds. There is a BBQ specialist store selling portable bbq grills and accessories. There is also a toy store at level 2 specialising in Lego and other Lego like toys. Parking can be a tad challenging as not much lots available. Both indoor and basement parking available.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117612630125288267206/reviews
Jane Bing,5,"Stop by to the bakery, a very delicious bread and baked goods!
But didnt read that they close at 6pm. Got there at 5.30 and the sourdough already sold out. Better go there in the morning or noon as their bread got sold out fast!
Will be back!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116294202051104411040/reviews
