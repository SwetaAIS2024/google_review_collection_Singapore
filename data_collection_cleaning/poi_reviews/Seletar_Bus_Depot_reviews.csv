Geraldine Chew,3,"A bit secluded. Hear say there’s air con and that it is ok. Not sure if I would recommend coming here since it’s quite a distance from the nearest bus stop and facilities.

It is big, spacious and clean. The latest bus depot for a while.
Do not try to trespass! Unless you are a staff member or bus captain!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114560348216019909563/reviews
