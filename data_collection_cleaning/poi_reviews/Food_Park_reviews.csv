Dawn Lim,4,"First time here, arrived at 1+pm. Not many stalls open. But there's a great Nasi Padang stall (Belacan @ Sin Ming) that also sells other Malay food such as Lontong, Ayam Penyet and more.

Belacan @ Sin Ming offers delicious Nasi Pandang that is also affordable.

Drinks here are reasonable with an Iced Teh O priced at $1.50.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113563695447323499189/reviews
Serene Tan,2,"only the zi char and drinks stall was opened when I was there mid afternoon, weekday. I had the san lou hor fun from zi char stall. Taste was so so. Teh C from the drinks stall was diluted and pricey.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107538103583075098533/reviews
Ernest Tang,1,"Boss has no compassion to those whom are here for funeral.
Would suggest those whom want to hold their last meals here to go elsewhere. Service, price, compassion are all lacking.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108491242341194338929/reviews
Chia Sammy,3,"Went there in the morning @0930hrs but most stalls are still Closed only F&B drinks stall is operating. There are several food stalls mostly open at late afternoon to cater for the crowds visiting the surrounding temples, funeral parlours and automobiles workshops. The advertised foods look delicious and tempting. Eating house is looking hygienic.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111452080602220609693/reviews
Ernest Pak,3,"Very limited choice of stalls as some are closed for good due to bad location - amidst funeral parlors.
Only less than 15 parking lots, seems you can reach there either by walking or bus.
The only stall that opens as of my last visit on May 6 are the tzi char and fish head seafood.
The tzi char is ok, having some signature dishes which is really worth coming back.
The seafood soup/fish head stall seems good too and patrons there mostly ordered their dishes.
They have Facebook too.
Worth coming if you are nearby.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112488876746036422261/reviews
