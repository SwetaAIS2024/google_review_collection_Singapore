      "text": "We booked in June 2022, simply this people ruined our day in Legoland. Its our mistake we dnt notice the deposit $60 which was mentioned somewhere in a corner of the booking.com. They kept messaging us for the deposit middle of our rides at Legoland which is 3hrs before the check-in time. As its our mistake not seen properly abt the deposit we made the transfer. Again they started to call n msg for orher docs, we said we can provide during the check-in, thy said we should checkin before 5.30pm, if we go the apartment after 5.30pm there wont be anyone to help us if there any issues at the property (wow). The vacation mood gone and we were disappointed but as we paid for the house and paid the deposit, we canceled and went to the apartment.\nNothingâ€¦ its a trash house. The blue sofa bed god! Did thy bring it from the trash area and keeping it?. Nothing according to the images thy have posted in the sites.\nImmediately we moved out and booked another hotel. My kids dnt liked it at all, smelly, dusty and the whole things at the property is old. If anything get spoilt definitely thy wont return the deposit we paid. I seriously dnt kw to laugh or angry. We are not Jokers to fall in to ur traps.\nThey returned the deposit after 3 days after several calls and messages.",

You have grocery stores and restaurants at a walking distance. Easier we you go there by car since it is not easy to get the taxi and it is expensive as well.",

Faulty lights bulbs at pantry and living room area. SMS the agent to ask about the wifi connection but didn't reply until on day of check out. Carpark exit is terribly narrow. Brown colour towels provided and look more like floor mats. Not within walking distance to famous landscapes or malls.",
