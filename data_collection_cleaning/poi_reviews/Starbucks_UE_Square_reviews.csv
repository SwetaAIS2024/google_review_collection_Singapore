Ryan Mullarkey,5,"Everything was great, only wish that the Starbucks app worked worldwide.  I understand giftcards and other currency based functions not working but it would be nice to be able to earn rewards points and track receipts.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112924460818834159115/reviews

R L,2,"Poor service. I ordered 2 drinks 15Apr2025. I was at the counter, he called my name which is fine and normal... I walked up. He simply placed my 2 drink on the counter and stood there for a while before attending other chores.

I had to maneuver my hands behind a table top poster to reach for the tray an place my drinks onto the tray!

I don't recall I have to do this myself in other Starbucks or Coffee beans!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117259954737255706391/reviews
Yosita Boonrat,2,"Yesterday, the order was accurate, but today I’m not sure what happened. Maybe it was a rush with too many customers this morning. The staff gave me the wrong menu, and when they redid it, it was still wrong. I ordered 1 shot of coffee, but I ended up with 2 shots (the default, I assume). It was way too strong (for me), and I couldn’t drink it. I didn’t want to make a fuss, so I just left without drinking it.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112403781137629098126/reviews
Ju C,2,"This is a hit or miss outlet.

If you get the ladies on duty in the morning, you will get an exceptional service where you are greeted with a smile and efficient service

If you get the men on duty like I did on 17 December, you get ignored and be treated like an invisible customer even though you are the only one in queue. The guy kept giving me his back while he took 5 mins to open the fridge and took out a croissant. Another 3 mins to put it into the toaster and still pretending that there is no customer waiting in queue.

Left without ordering and went to another cafe where I was greeted with a warm smile.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103557478438451777524/reviews
