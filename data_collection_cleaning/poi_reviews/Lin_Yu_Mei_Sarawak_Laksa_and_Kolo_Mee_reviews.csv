KKT,2,"Tried again after a long time, still pretty much the same.
Soup quite plain, original dry noodle same too.
Tried laksa which only available weekend, prawn size not bad but flesh quite dry, laksa soup feels like overnight ü§î, maybe it's my perception only.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
Maruli Lee,5,"My favourite go-to for breakfast. Pretty sizeable portion at just $4. Very fast service. Lots of seating space in the morning so the area is quite peaceful. Noodle is very consistently aldente, which I like. The cut chili is to die for, very spicy!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106681171133471989483/reviews
NickNick ‚ÄúNickNickNickNickNick‚Äù NickNickNick,5,"Love this kolo mee! The menu is simple, and the food is delicious! For just $4.50 (and no takeaway fee), this is my cheat day food. You can choose between their signature sauce, or choose between Red or Black. Try them all! They are all good. The best part is their chili--but be warned!--it packs a punch. Everything is served nicely topped with crunchy shallots and well braised minced meat.

Do also try their QQ fishballs! They are very Q ü§£",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105038628548208662968/reviews
BC,4,"Been having brunch most of the weekend at Leong Ji Kitchen kopitiam, and 1 of the reason - Sarawak Laksa by Lin Yu Mei stall. The laksa gravy  is getting better - thicker and flavourful. But, not quite there yet, almost as good as the real Sarawak laksa in Kuching. I normally ordered large size üòÖ then have my dessert at Sugar Town next door üòä",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105428579458552695279/reviews
Jacob TAN,3,"Bought the original sarawak kolo mee and the chicken cutlet kolo mee today as there were not too many options in this coffeeshop. The shallot oil smell and taste for both these dishes are very strong. If you do not like the smell or taste of shallot oil, you should skip this stall. The noodle used is similar to instant noodle. Not much ingredients for either of the dish.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
