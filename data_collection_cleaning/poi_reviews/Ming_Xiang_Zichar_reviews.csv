Charlemagne Cheng,1,"I came here to get my  curry fish head fixâ€¦ major disappointment. At $30/pot, it probably is one of the worst Iâ€™ve eatenâ€¦ burnt taste and nothing else. It is as if the chef forgot about this pot and burnt the curry and the ladies finger inside. Pretty unpleasant burnt taste throughout. And I arrived after 2pm, not like they were super crowded. Not coming to eat their fish head curry anymore.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103913516560594858336/reviews

Darren Sia,2,"Horrible serving portion. Been shrinking every year. $6.70 for pork rib rice. 4 small miserable pieces of rib, which has more bones than meat.

Very generous with rice and sauce.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113281183169323038829/reviews
Wang Teck Heng,4,"Just had dinner here on the weekend. We ordered to serve 9 pax and I must say that most orders only need to be medium in size. We also choose more dishes so that everyone could try out the different dishes. The curry fish head was my favourite of all the dishes. Sambal mixed vegetables was another highlight. Marmite chicken is a great choice for kids since itâ€™s boneless. Har Cheong Chicken was pretty good. The other dishes were quite in line with most stalls. Considering a weekend, we did not wait too long for our food. This may not be the best zichar around but itâ€™s certainly one that I will revisit for its convenience and value.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104861192728726319756/reviews
