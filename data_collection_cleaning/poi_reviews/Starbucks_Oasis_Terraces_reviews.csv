i ordered oat matcha frappe with java chips but only came normal matcha frappe.. usually busyness of store doesnt seem too busy so why is it that grab orders are always wrong? somemore i paid for those modifications..

Tan. W,3,"Tried their New Year Treat – the Chicken Luncheon, Tamago, and Cheese Brioche Bun ($6.90). As someone who’s not really into cheese, I was happy to know it could be omitted upon request. The brioche is toasted, which gives it a crispy texture; it’s slightly tough but still delicious, though I can’t quite explain why. The luncheon meat is on the salty side, while the tamago lacks much flavor, but together they create a good balance.

I also spotted a tray of Starbucks takeaway cups, which turned out to be free coffee grounds. I learned you can extend their life by using them as a body scrub, in gardening, or to neutralize odors. From grounds to garden – a nice little bonus!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103022836553318535151/reviews
