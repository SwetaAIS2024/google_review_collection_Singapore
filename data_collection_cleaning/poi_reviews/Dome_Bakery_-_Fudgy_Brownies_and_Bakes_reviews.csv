Serena (Serena),5,"Came across an adorable little shop on a street corner in Chinatown!
I was just passing by when I saw lava brownies in the window ‚Äî every flavor looked so good I ended up grabbing a whole box üòç

The outer shell is crispy, and the brownie itself has a bittersweet, rich cocoa flavor.
Each one bursts with molten filling when you break it open ‚Äî if you reheat them in an air fryer or microwave, the filling flows out even more ü§§",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110324569207562886734/reviews

Medric Chew,5,"Got the fudgy brownies and matcha ones from Dome Bakery for a party, and they were a hit with my friends! The packaging was super cute, which made it a nice touch for gifting.

The matcha brownie could have had a more filling, and personally, everything was a bit on the sweeter side for me. Still, they were delicious, and I‚Äôd definitely recommend giving them a try!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103146187074913164978/reviews
