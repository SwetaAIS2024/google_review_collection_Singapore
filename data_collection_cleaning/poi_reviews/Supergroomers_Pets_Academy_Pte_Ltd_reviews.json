Michelle is an exceptional instructor - she is incredibly patient, pays dedicated attention to each student, and goes out of her way to correct our weaknesses while sharing her vast knowledge to ensure that her students learn the right technique to groom dogs safely.\n\nIf you're looking to develop your pet grooming skills, I canâ€™t recommend SuperGroomers enough. Thank you, Michelle, for inspiring and guiding me on this grooming journey!",

      "text": "Who knew pet grooming is'nt as easy as what the aunties and uncles say it would be \"cut only ma?\"\nAfter years in my former industry, I decided to make a change\nSGPA provided me with a Class C course and I graduated in three months. Now I am able to find a more rewarding job.\nLearning took place in an environment that was bright, clean, and conducive to a positive learning experience.\nMy classes at Michelle's were always full, and she makes sure she targets all of our weaknesses and gives us her full attention. Throughout the grooming process, Michelle provides a safe environment for us learners and our model dogs.\nMichelle's constant reassurances extended beyond the classroom, she also showed concern and care for our personal lives as well.\nThe staff JiaYi, JiaXuan, Paula and Alvin were also very helpful. Despite the approaching Class C examination, they made sure my time there was enjoyable.\nI will definitely be back to further my skill set.\nThank you SuperGroomers Pets Academy and MasMas Groomers.",
