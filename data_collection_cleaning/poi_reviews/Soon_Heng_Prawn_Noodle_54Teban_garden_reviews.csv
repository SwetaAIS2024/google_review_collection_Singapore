Khaiweng Leong,3,"Ordered a big prawn noodle. $6.00. Soup is light and bland to me. Needed a lot of condiments for flavour despite what I have put in. Including soy sauce and chilli. Disappointing.

If it’s because of HPB sodium reduction strategy, a lot of traditional flavours will be wipe out. Just my opinion.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111839369814315090380/reviews

Beng Hui Kang,2,"We drove 20min to try it, base on google ratings . Disappointed.
The pictures at the store overrates the actual. Prawn noodles shops that sell other than prawn/pork rib noodles raised the flag.
The service was good for a coffeeshop store though.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106996065285434955538/reviews
Alvin C,5,"I have not try the prawn noodle yet, but my wife and I simply love the Laska. The sauce is thick and flavorful. The owner is friendly and generous on the portion. We would definitely stop by this coffeeshop just in front of the Pandan Reservoir whenever we pass by Teban Gardens. Too bad, they don't have a stall in the East of Singapore. Laska is selling at $3.80 and I hope it will remain affordable...",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102181790026215103000/reviews
