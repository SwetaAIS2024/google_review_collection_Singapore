As a less than 10 year old kid I did not realised that it was a very serious thing.\n\nI was always sent late to school because my school was the furtherst away from the center compared to the other kids in choa chu kang. I remember mentioning this but I got told \"too bad\".\n\nSadly as I am a petty person when it comes to such incidents. Hopefully they have at least phased out the teachers and improved their standards, otherwise please avoid.",

Also have poor experience with them.\n\nOne of the example, the teacher also require them to take the rubbish bag from the centre and throw it to the bin outside the centre (this kind of job should have taken care by the centre cleaner).",
