Ordered came with fishballs, minced meat, lean meat, sliced fish cake, baby romaine and XXL size pork lard.\nNoodle is well cooked, springy. Their dry version is doused with vinegar, mixed with their chilli making it a savoury, sour and spicy combination of goodness. Fishball and fishcake is more on the firm springy side. The bowl of soup has plently of minced meat which is well seasoned, however i do not taste similar on the lean meat slices. There is also a good portion of veggies. I am never a fan of pork lard, but was attracted by the size and amount added in the bowl. Did I finished all, yes! The lady boss is always so warm and friendly!!",

I guess auntie take the time My partner ordered kway teow dry with fish ball ($5) while I ordered mee tai mak soup($5)! Seeing the picture, this is the amount of ingredients auntie gave us for its price! Tons of fishball, minced meat and fishcak and even the veggies. Will try it in dry version with chilli the next time I'm here :) but you gotta be patient for it, maybe come early before 9am!",
