      "text": "Unlike most water parks, the water here is very shallow, like a stream. But interestingly, the design is clever with winding water. The children are very happy here. I can see many birds come here to drink water. It should be noted that water only comes out from 8-11am and 4 - 8 pm every Thursday to Sunday. Very nice place for all!",

Suitable for toddlers and kids as the water is shallow, flowing from the small pool to ground ‚Äî a mini pool which only one child can sit inside.\nThere is toilet nearby with shower facility.\nGood weekend activity for kids to enjoy in nature!",

This place is less crowded than the the other Bishan park across the road.  There is a Carpark nearby and toilet facilities.  You can grab drinks from the vending machine outside the toilet.  There is a schedule time for the water play.  A shelter nearly serves as a resting spot from the hot or wet weather.",
