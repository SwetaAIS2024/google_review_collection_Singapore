Melissa Sim,5,"Found this tennis lesson series on the meetup app and decided to attend to find out if itâ€™s any good. After my first session, i decided to sign up for package lessons because i thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and was happy to continue. The group sizes were perfect - groups of 4 students to 1 coach - which made the attention given nicely distributed. You will definitely pick up skills with these class sizes, and wont feel pressured or burnt out during the drills. I would definitely carry on with my lessons until i become proficient in the game!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100118894250066591943/reviews
