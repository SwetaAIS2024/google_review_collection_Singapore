zhenyu,5,"Excellent customer service by Nicholas Ong, was attended by him on 21 August 2019, around 3pm. A young and very patient guy, explained all the fine details and advice on the better plan that’s more suitable for me. I signed up for 2 additional lines. Pleasant transaction. Very friendly and helpful guy. Very rare to encounter someone who’s helpful in the telecommunications services. Thanks for brighten up my day.

Harsh W,1,"Had a disappointing experience today after my visit...
Found out the phone I had purchased has motherboard issues (Samsung A52) After talking it back I was promptly sent away to Samsung. I asked the resentative if I can purchase a wireless charger, and whether it is compatible with my phone which he responded to with ""yes""  Only after I test it (which was not allowed in the store), now I find out I need another wireless adaptor to use the wireless charger... I'm quite disappointed with the staff knowledge.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103339575801050294823/reviews
