EM,5,My daughter loves learning to play piano from Teacher Chelsea. She is very friendly and patient to teach her. What I also like about them is that the teacher will share with us about her progress after each lesson. The Studio at Bukit Merah is not huge but very nicely maintained.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103120747672590892539/reviews
Seoul SeokJin,5,"Chanced upon the new Melodious Piano Studio at Bukit Merah as itâ€™s very near to my place. Its a small studio but looks bright and nice decor. The teachers are very friendly and warm. My son loves the class and wanted to go back every day instead of weekly. Teacher Miao Jun is patient and gentle with him and will give feedback (video) after each lesson. Even though he just joined for about a month, he got to participate in a mini performance with the rest of the students. Definitely recommended.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107980625395588753717/reviews
