It is an endangered tree in Asia due to over harvesting.",

Since concrete railings are new, it's also good for family outings.\n\nWhen it rains, the trail becomes bit muddy and slippery in parts where there is no concrete railings or boardwalk, please wear proper footwears.\n\nThe highlight of the trail of viewpoint of Hindhede Quarry pond and also hiking downhill for the pond.",
