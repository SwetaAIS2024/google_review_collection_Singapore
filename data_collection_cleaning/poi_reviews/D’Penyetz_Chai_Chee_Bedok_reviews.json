I highly recommend it to fans of Indonesian cuisine and anyone looking to try something new. Very family friendly too because kids menu are also available. Love the indomie. The staffs are friendly and good ambience too. Highly recommended!",

      "text": "It's been a while since, we finally had the pleasure of savoring good ayam penyet again. The chicken was so mouthwatering that my daughter, who usually doesn't finish a full meal, wanted it all to herself. We were more than happy to order another serving. What stood out was the freshness of the food, which is crucial for us. I also tried the Tahu telor Goreng, which was incredibly delicious, although a bit salty. However, I understand it's meant to be shared with rice, and I must admit, but I enjoyed it that way all by itself.  The owners were all hands on deck. Very nice couple hope to see you around Punggol too.",
