Not sure if the mookata is under Uncle Leong but they had the same menu booklet. Staff still told us that they used the gas stove the day before to cook and nothing happened lol cool but it happened today and we were disgusted by it.\n\nDine there if you fancy having some cockroach buddies.\n\nHowever, staff attempted service recovery by “treating us” for the meal.",
