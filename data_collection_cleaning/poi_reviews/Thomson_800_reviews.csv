H JM,4,"Carpark a plenty though dark. Tennis courts were properly maintained and of proper size. Clubhouse toilets were recently renovated so it was clean and new. Location is good for those who are driving. For a 21 years old property, this development is properly maintained.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115011073902467306286/reviews

Samuel Lipoff,3,"Had an amazing view when I stayed here.  It's an older condo, which is fine, and I liked the slightly ulu-feeling location.  But it was a bad place to stay without a car.  Caldecott is a 12 minute walk away with little shelter; Toa Payoh and the nearest hawker center (admittedly one of the best in Singapore) is a good 20 minute walk away.  Buses into the city are easy to catch, but going north to Upper Thomson requires a circuitous walk up and down stairs.  Coming back home via bus from Bishan MRT is not bad, but often had a long wait for the only viable bus.  But inside the condo there are basically no sidewalks, and it was sad to see BMW and Benz wielding residents driving with little consideration for pedestrians who are almost all domestic helpers.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110394865249528273768/reviews
