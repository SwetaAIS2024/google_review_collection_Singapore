      "text": "The hotel is run by a family and it is like being in their home. Go for a more expensive room if you can. The neighborhood is exclusive, million dollars homes, close to hospital if you needed to visit 14 minutes away walking. There is a mall for shopping even closer. Easy access to transit. And very close to connecting park pathways. It is in need of updates but there is a staff person watching the desk 24 hours. Single lady traveling alone I had no worries. Cash only as they don't have a card machine. Also have WiFi. Best location in city",
