Keith Sim,5,Found this pet friendly F&B outlet next to the park. They have quite a sizable outdoor pet friendly area. Ordered the satay and aiyu drink for myself and a blueberry ice cream for my dog. She seem to love it. The satay is good. Will come back again to try out other dishes next time.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101220663446655341017/reviews
Ming Siong Tan,5,"For a residential area, this is a fun and lively beer garden with a great atmosphere. It offers a wide variety of food, including both Western cuisine and local delights. The food is generally good, though the prices may feel high for those accustomed to hawker center prices. Plus, the place is air-conditioned, providing a nice escape from the heat!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108075437842363289446/reviews
Jk l,5,"A not so hidden gem as it is always bustling!   Best to make a reservation as we did so as to secure seats on a Saturday evening.
The food were reasonably priced and of good value, considering the portions. The wanton mee and satay were flavourful, and will be repeat orders for future visits. The hokkien mee had the wok hey taste but was a little too salty, while the basil pork was average and spicy. The fish and chips was not bad. Service was prompt and friendly. All in, it was a pleasant visit.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104073403253877964253/reviews

Jaylyn Tan,5,"Visited Daruma Tavern at the Punggol outlet and had such a wonderful time! The vibe here is chill and welcoming—perfect for hanging out with family and friends. The food was absolutely delicious! We ordered the sirloin steak, pork knuckles, porky burger, dai lok mee, bee hoon, satay, fried wanton, and soft shell crab—everything was on point.

A special shoutout to the Indian staff member who served us—he was super friendly, always smiling, and made sure we were enjoying our food. That kind of service really makes a difference.

My aunt loved the satay and said both the meat and the sauce had that nostalgic, old-school flavor. We ended up daobao-ing more satay and Hokkien mee because they were just that good. Plus, they even had ice cream for our furkid, which was such a sweet touch!

They also have outdoor seating, so you can bring your pets along. Right now, they only offer ice cream for furkids, but we’re hoping they’ll introduce a full pet menu in the future.

Overall, it was a great experience and I’ll definitely be back—and bringing more friends next time!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105673560004475554015/reviews
