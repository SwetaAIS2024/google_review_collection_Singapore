Hadiya,5,"Beautiful church experience. Myself and my husband Ryen visited on the 25th January and we were so warmly greeted by everyone. We really felt welcomed the entire time and stayed for lunch. We enjoyed fellowship with the church members who were so sweet, engaging and eager to get to know us. We look forward to returning again and thank the church for its incredible hospitality and warmth. We also found the sermons and Sabbath schools engaging and thought provoking. All round a positive experience at church in every aspect.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117731743438793484091/reviews
FY Chia,1,"Not about the church, but a public announcement in case similar things happen.

A blind man insisted that we send him to the church from JE MRT; then after that, he asked for money, we initially offered $5 but he demanded for even more. Bad experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100054240401801920868/reviews

Nik Wesley,5,"I have visited only once now. From what I experienced, people are friendly and welcoming. It is a multicultural church with both English and Chinese services. Lots of avenues to take part in.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100264838712445950633/reviews
