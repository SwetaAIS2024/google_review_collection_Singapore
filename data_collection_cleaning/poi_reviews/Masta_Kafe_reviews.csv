MAD Mama,4,Mushroom soup yummy. The friendly cashier never asked how the ribeye to be cooked. Luckily it went well quite tender. French fries a bit salty. Coffee just warm not hot.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111827780067936585673/reviews
Zen Woo,4,"Went for a dental appointment at the National University Oral Care building and happened to chance upon this dainty cafe.

There wasn't a lot of people around at the time but the mains took really long (at least 20 minutes) to be served. Fortunately, the starters were served earlier.

Objectively, the food tastes decent. Chicken chop is well grilled and tender, but fried were a little average like those that you can find at neighbourhood western stalls. For the price they are commanding ($18 for a set meal with soup and drinks), I would have to say that the quality is below the price-grade. Perhaps it is because of the rent, but still worth a try for yourself if you are in the area, just don't have too high expectations.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111076005839848853083/reviews
JW Y,5,"A hidden gem located at the medical centre. The salad and drinks set are pretty worth the money, the salad comes in quite a generous portion, and the lemon tea is very thick “gao”. I highly recommend their cream base pasta; it is creamy, thick and tasty, unlike those water down cream pasta I had elsewhere.

Do avoid the peak period as it can be very crowded and the standard might drop due to the rush. My advise would be to visit them as early as 11.30am.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108511850293315854587/reviews
Sreejith Balakrishnan,2,"Salmon Aglio-Olio was ok, even though the salmon portion size was too small for the price. Avoid their beef bolognese pasta. It is super oily and has a sweet taste. It resembles beef rendang more than beef bolognese. Mushroom soup that came with the set was quite bland as well. Overall, a bad experience.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105683664957229345063/reviews
Get It Right Singapore Education Services,5,"Simple, fuss free student menu available. Prices are reasonable for the tasty meals. Good place to have a more leisurely meal especially with kids.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115216687740196793552/reviews
