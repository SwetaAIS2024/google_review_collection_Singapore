Bibhor Saxena,5,"Very very posh location, just after the MRT station you can come to orchard road where you can see luxurious restaurants, hotels, bars, complex, buildings etc. this is probably the most posh and expensive place of Singapore, one must visit the place. this place is also a part of city tour but i would recommend that you should come separately so that you can devote more time. ION mall is a must visit place. Go to the observatory in the mall to have a nice view from the top. Have a walk on the sides of the road and see the luxurious and very posh places one after another. Take pictures and enjoy the beauty of the place.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104791134259349404135/reviews
