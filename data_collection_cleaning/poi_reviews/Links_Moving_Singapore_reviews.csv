Mukesh Upadhyay,1,I have waited for 4 months to arrive my shipment from Singapore to NZ but i have still not received. Worst part is there is no update from them whatsoever and on the name of customs and inspections they charge huge money from their customers. Don’t trust this people they are doing cheating. Their pick up staff also stolen money from my home.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100914246628184165767/reviews
Meann Chua,1,"Worst customer service and after sales service. We never heard from these people when we asked for some updates of our shipment from Singapore to Canada. We don’t mind the waiting time, it’s the customer service and updates that we’re disappointed of. Never that we recommend to use this company.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116236470501608557763/reviews
