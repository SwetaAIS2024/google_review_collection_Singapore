Flo Yeow,2,"This stall offers a wide variety, but their oyster omelette didn't quite impress me. It leaned too heavily on flour, and could have benefited from more egg. Even with the chili, the overall dish lacked a certain vibrancy.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Lim B,1,"Terrible experience - cucumbers were already going bad or starting to dry up and yet, it was served to us. As expected, they were off. Mutton satay was also sour-ish. Stall owner changed it for us. Ketupat was dry and tasteless.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105874836614112720261/reviews
Darren Cheong,4,"Very nice oyster omelette, but the portion is quite small for $8 SGD, with only 6 small oysters. Seems like a tourist price.

The satay (mutton, chicken, and pork) is reasonably priced at $0.80 SGD each. The peanut sauce is delicious; I really enjoyed it.

Overall, the food is good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136407063098297690/reviews

Zy Tan,4,"Came here while strolling at ECP. Unlike most orh luak places, this stall actually fries the oyster with all that eggy gooey goodness. It's flavoured well, crispy and gooey, and had enough oysters. I didn't get to try their carrot cake and satay since they ran out, but the orh luak is a good enough reason!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111980790781970783722/reviews
