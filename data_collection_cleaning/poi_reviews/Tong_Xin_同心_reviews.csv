Kat Darling,5,"Really like this stall. Their kway teow is delicious especially if you add their chili sauce and fried pork fat.

Plus tasted their white/black carrot cake (not a cake but an omelette) it was also YUM.

Sister is nice and accomodating too even if she isnt keen on smiling. Very very yum.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103339889798779197667/reviews
Ronny McPherson,5,"Excellent. One of, if not the BEST Oyster omelet ('Or luak') in Singapore.
The egg omelet is actually Crispy and not soggy as per the usual.
The oysters are suprisingly fresh and not foul tasting at all. Delectable, creamy, succulent oysters.
These two components paired with the tangy chilly make this dish extremely savoury and appetising.

The Black fried carrot cake (Chai tao kuay) here is also fantastic. I recommend adding an additional egg for +$1.
Strong and smokey 'Wok hey' flavour, quintessential to a proper Chai tao kuay.
Smokey, sweet, savoury, and satisfying. This captures the essence of local hawker fried food. Superbly well done.

Will definitely return.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102972920635459603725/reviews
cse1217,5,"Tong Xin's white fried carrot cake is very fresh, tasty and nice. The chili that comes with it are those used for the fried oyster. It's not spicy and on the sour and gives some mild spices to it.

Their fried Kway Tiao is also very yummy and sweet.

The chef frying the fried carrot cake is cheerful and so happy to capture his smiling face!

Supreet Kini,5,"Was craving hawker food and found this place on Grab and decided to order the following -

1) Hokkien prawn Mee - Delcious, soft noodles. Prawns are not deshelled but I like it. About 6-7 pieces of medium size prawns were provided.

2) Char Kway Teow - At $8 I thought the quantity was a bit less but taste wise this is a good Kway Teow. Comes with cockles, beansprouts and Chinese sausage.

3) Mixed Carrot Cake - Really like the white carrot cake - so soft. Even the black carrot cake is flavourful.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105328280516267995599/reviews
Weimin Ong,3,Ordered the Hokkien Mee because I saw the reviews were good. First few mouths tasted good but as it cooled I realised it was actually pretty mid - both my mum and husband felt the same too. Overall so so but I haven't tried the other dishes so might give it another try when I'm back.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106180724988450175797/reviews
