Terence Israel,1,"Despite being advertised to have kids furniture and baby cot, the selection is extremely limited. But this warehouse has a wider selection of furniture instead. There was only two types of baby cot available with a very limited range of kids furniture. If you’re looking for other furniture, this is probably a good place to visit. But for children’s furniture, this is disappointing.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117706795224660745102/reviews
Claire Cellerin,1,Despite the shop name there are only 3 cots in a very dusty room. Such a waste of time ! I don’t understand this high rating…,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112115692327263663752/reviews
Matthew Pham,2,"We ordered a cot during a baby fair and they told us they would deliver within a few months, as our baby was not out yet. One week before the promised date, nobody contacted me so I had to reach out to them. It was very difficult to contact them. There were some numbers on their website but none worked. I managed to reach out to a guy via whatsapp. The guy told me not to worry he would arrange the delivery, but he didnt give me any delivery confirmation and did not update me afterwards. Then when I reached out to him again he stopped responding. We only received the delivery notification from the shipping company 1 day before it arrived. Luckily the cot came in time for my baby's birth. The cot itself is decent, but the customer service is horrible. If you want to buy from them, buy at the store and demand the delivery confirmation upfront. If I had not reminded them, I dont know if they would remember to deliver or not.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114456280365698421426/reviews
S S,2,"Good installation of baby bed. Included bunk bed. Came on time and polite men

*EDITED TO 2 STARS*

I couldnt do a proper review at the time but have had some time to inspect the bed and would not recommend.

The quality is absolutely not worth the price. Guys who installed it also seemed to have cracked the wood a lot and did not install it neatly. Just because it's a discounted item doesnt mean it has to be installed badly or sloppily?

Additionally i am not sure what the confusion was in installation. I installed a second part that they did not do (the slide) with no manual, no instruction booklet and could do it as a single woman with no power tools (just a screwdriver and my 2 hands) but they couldnt even though they were 2 experienced guys???

Would not buy from picket and rail again. Absolutely not worth the money.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111956641993993630438/reviews
Fei Zhao,5,"Great experience @ Picket&Rail Baby cots furniture. Alex is for sure the best sales consultant I have come across, not only he is knowledgeable, he is also super patient with my hundreds of questions. I would give him 6 stars if I could. Thumbs up!

Thanks Alex for the excellent service!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106233661198614843764/reviews
