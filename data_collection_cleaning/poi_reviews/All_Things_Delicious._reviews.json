      "text": "Excellent service from the whole team on Sunday afternoon, 20th April. They were managing a big group but still gave wonderful service to the other tables. Hats off to the 2 chefs as well for being able to prepare the orders timely, even though we had ordered after the big group. We did have one dish that came a bit later, but it was no trouble for us and the staff were apologetic as well, during and after as we left. They didn‚Äôt have to but they also apologized for the atmosphere being a little noisy.\n\nWe really appreciate the warm welcome, amazing service, and attention to detail from all the staff!",

Usually there‚Äôs a waitlist (but it‚Äôs not too bad) the prices are really reasonable so probably that‚Äôs why.\n\nOrdered the roasted pumpkin and caramelised onion panini and it was delicious! Im not sure about the weird egg white looking thing, personally would have preferred more grilled veggies over eggs and cheese but that‚Äôs just me.\n\nIt‚Äôs a nice place to sit and chat. Also lovely pastries.",
