After completing my transaction at the counter, I remained seated briefly within the branch area to clear some emails for about 15 minutes. Despite the branch not being crowded, the security staff member repeatedly approached me and told me to leave, stating that the seats were for \"customers only.\" I found this remark to be both confusing and discourteous, as I had just completed a transaction and was, in fact, a customer.",

      "text": "Really stupid and lousy bank.\n\nThey had initially screwed up my phone renewal of my Fixed Deposit, renewing it for 12 months instead of my instructions for a 6 mth placement in December 2024\n\nThe customer service officer was not friendly when servicing me on this matter, telling me he needed 1 week to look into the matter, which I find it very long and inefficient.\n\nThat very evening, he called to inform that he had changed to the 6 mth placement.  I told him I had a change of mind and wish to maintain the original 12cmth placement.  He became agitated and told me not to change anymore.\n\nI called the next day to amend back my FD to 12 mth placement from the 6 mth placement he had changed to the day before. This was attended to by another Customer service officer who agreed.\n\nTo my horror,  Ifollowing that I received another 6 calls with some 3 calls even on the same day extending over the weekend asking for confirmation on my instruction, non stop harassment!!!! And then they told me that thus is pending confirmation from their management???!!!\n\nHow many times you need me to confirm my instructions???\n\nThis is really screwed up!! In this digital age where virtual bank are already aplenty, they are still operating in the 70s. If they are not comfortable with phone banking instructions,  then don't allow!!! You guys are so dinosaur and definitely not ready to handle phone nor Internet banking... amd pending management approval?? Another 3 mths??\n\nOh God!!!",

She simply slammed the NRIC and piece of paper which she wrote on on the table right in front of us. She didn’t bother explaining to us and it felt like she was in a hurry to rush us off. Asked her follow up questions and frowned and replied impatiently and rudely.",
