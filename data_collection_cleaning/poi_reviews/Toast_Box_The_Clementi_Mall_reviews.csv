M Chow,2,I'm wondering if the food has shrunk or the plates have gotten bigger??? I used to get their soft boiled eggs but the egg white was runny and looked more like milk than egg white. Not sure if it was the quality of the eggs they used or the quality of their kitchen staff.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100221802376394190604/reviews

Samuel Ng,5,"Curry chicken is probably one of the oldest Cantonese dish that I know. I remember eating like 40 years ago. When I visited Hongkong a few years back I had curry chicken there. The style is distinctly the same with potatoes, tau pok and chicken cooked in curry until it’s soft.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116466170234652095347/reviews
NYY,1,"Even in today’s market, $6.70 for a breakfast set is highly exorbitant. Literally off the charts expensive. Won’t patronise again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113933141618585219203/reviews
Bryze Kane,1,Food is great but service is average. I waited for an hour for my order until a crew asks over if I really ordered. I didn’t want to bother them because it is a busy day. When he came over he gaslighted me on why I just waited and didn't ask for my order. I mean seriously there is a pager for a reason.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102217860686209864979/reviews
