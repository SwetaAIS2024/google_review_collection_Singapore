      "text": "SLC is the right choice I made this year!\n\nFirst, the location is real easily accessible, only about 5 minutes walking from Mary mount MRT exit B, which suits parents like me who have always tapped on the public commuting system.\n\nI still remembered the day when I first walked in to the school with my girl, the staff was incredibly welcoming and professional. Despite we were lost at first, we were then guided and very soon we got our way.\n\nThe curriculum is well-structured, with a balance of grammar, vocabulary, and conversational practice and I must give my special thanks to Teacher Christ who has been so dedicated and patience. I saw improvement within 6 months, not the grade itself but the ability to describe things in details and flowery words in her essay writing.\n\nNow that finally I have a peace of mind after months of struggles in order to guide her.",

Your syllabus is customized for your learning and can also put you ahead of your peers in terms of answering and writing techniques, and vocabulary.\n\nThe tutors are very casual and friendly, so do not be afraid to strike up a conversation with them, but don't drag it on! They also can go fast or slow, depending on your preference!\n\nSLC has not only allowed me to improve in my Chinese ability, but also do it in an enjoyable way. Highly recommended!",
