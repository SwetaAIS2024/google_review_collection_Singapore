Gravy given was generous too.The service was prompt and communication is fast. If you want to avoid long queue, just choose their delivery option. Delivery was on time, infact early. Dont hesitate to order. üëç Thank you Haron Satay!",

Called Haron satay but no response as well. Could not wait any further and left. We did not have food for iftar that evening and so did a few others who were waiting too. Hope you wake up and learn from this disaster.",

Nobody came out to the collection area to explain the delay or expected waiting time. Can't even find anyone to cancel order as system is automated.  Made me late to collect my other food orders and totally messed up my family event. Order was only ready at 5.41 pm and it was lukewarm when I picked it up from the locker. didn't even feel like it was just cooked.",
