eagan tan,5,this is one of my favourite mamashops of all time. i especially love  the kaki bukit outlet. the owner of the stall is a very kind and helpful man that has a nice shop. the young boy at the counter is also very handsome and is very respectful towards all his customers. i also especially love the ribena from the fridge!! it is yummy,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111765018432381771885/reviews
