Wee KAH HUI,5,"Must come find Dr. Chen. She looks young but very professional and got well knowledge for TCM. Her acupuncture skills are amazing too. I had seen a bunch of other doctors before without much luck, but she figured out the problem right away and treated it really effectively. She's also really friendly and makes you feel comfortable. Highly recommend!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100973309458384935726/reviews

YJ Park,5,"While living in Malaysia for a month, I got a bad itch on my back while playing golf. I was very worried because it was so severe that I couldn't move, but thanks to acupuncture treatment from the director and deputy director, I'm almost recovering.

It's only just opened and there aren't any reviews, so I think there are a lot of people who don't know about it yet.
Since it is near the Fraser Hotel, we recommend visiting if you live in Puteri and are having trouble with muscle pain.
I didn't know there was an oriental medicine clinic, so I got a massage and my case got worse, so I recommend going to an oriental medicine clinic rather than a massage.

I think I will recover 100% by tomorrow.
Especially the Deputy Director. Thank you for carefully checking my condition and providing treatment.^^",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105520087713741694662/reviews
Ïù∏ÏÑ†Ïû•,5,"The director looked young, so I felt a little nervous at first, but it went away after treatment. I think he really is a doctor!! Frozen shoulder is really the best!! It‚Äôs amazing how much I‚Äôve improved so quickly! I really thought I might have allergies, but after just one acupuncture treatment, the itchiness got better right away. It's a shame it's not available in Korea!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105307595520839374671/reviews
Ïù¥Ï©êÏù¥,5,"The deputy director is kind and very talented!! Perhaps because it's new, the atmosphere is pleasant and I think I'll only go to this oriental medicine clinic from now on. I recommend it!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117725983648226101380/reviews
