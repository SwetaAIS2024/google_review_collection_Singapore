Satay was also fantastic, just look at the fats.  Pork and chicken satay both are tender.  The satay sauce is so smooth and delicious.  Best of all to me and my Laogong. So not need to go elsewhere. Our favourite stall!‚ù§Ô∏è",

However, the chilli sauce that came with the chicken wing is awesome. It tastes slightly more sourish though, so it's up to personal taste.",

The glaze on the food was just mesmerising.\n\nEach of the satay skewers was generous pieces of pork, not those thin or half pieces, they were fully packed skewers! The peanut sauce that came with it was quite nice, taste of peanut chunks and was sweet. It was quite filling and satisfying to eat the Lontong too!\n\nChicken wings were pretty good, nice grilled taste, and pretty spicy but savoury chilli sauce. Squeeze that lime either on the chicken or the chilli sauce for a twist in taste!\n\n‚ú® Ambience wise: Hawker centre!\n\nü§µüèª Service wise: Great!\n\nüíµ Price wise:\nPork Satay $0.80\nChicken wings $1.50",

The gravy was average too, without much fragrance from the peanuts. The chicken wings tasted slightly better. Service was slow as there were many orders.",
