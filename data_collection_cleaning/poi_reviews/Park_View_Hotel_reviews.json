The location is fantastic too - right in the middle of Bugis. And you can practically stumble out the door and find tons of great restaurants just a few steps away. Our family room was surprisingky spacious with a single and a double bed, and everything was spotless clean. Definitely a greay choice for a comfortable and convenient stay.",

      "text": "The location is good that you can walk to Marina Bay in 30 mins, Chinatown 30mins and Little India around 15mins. However I have to put 1 star rating because my family of 3, me, my husband and my 10 months old son got FOOD POISION after we had breakfast from the hotel (we ate on that day nothing but their breakfast). We all then had to go to hospital and my husband had to stay in the hospital for 1 night of observation because he was in the critical situations. However, after reporting to the hotel, we got NO APOLOGIES from the hotel. And the hotel denied their responsibility as they said none of their guests got sick except of us. We have a report from the doctors that we got food poisoning but they said it does not mentioned their hotel so its not their responsibility.\nAdditionally when I asked for changing bed sheet, the receptionist said all staff have gone, we have to wait for next day. But when we went out to buy drinks, they sent someone to come to our room for cleaning. On one side, it was good but on the other side, I do not understand why they have to lie to me about having mo staff????",
