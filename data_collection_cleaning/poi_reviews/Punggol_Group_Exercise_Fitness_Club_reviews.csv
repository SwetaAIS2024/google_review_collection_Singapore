Diana LP Loo,5,"I was looking for a fitness group to join that is not too far away from home and found this. Terence, the trainer, was very prompt and helpful in providing me with the info that I requested. I signed up for my first trial work-out on the same day and it was just what I needed. The right intensity of workouts and abit of challenge to get my heart pumping. I was perspiring buckets after. The best part was the outdoor environment, participants who were very friendly and welcoming that made the evening very enjoyable.

I will definitely join them again.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113828388217595605106/reviews

Rita Tiwari,5,"I started with Coach Terence many years back. Stopped for a few years as we shifted. Now that I'm back in the same area all I could think of was starting back with Coach Terence.
He motivates alot n let's us take it on our own pace. I loved his zumba classes when he use to have it. He is really a good n patient Coach!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114783303335905871877/reviews
