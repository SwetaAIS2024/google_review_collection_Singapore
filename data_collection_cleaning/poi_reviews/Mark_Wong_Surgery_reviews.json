      "text": "I will start with a back ground to my life changing event in 2020. I thought I was bullet proof, in that I was fit and healthy or so I thought for a 67 year old. Two days prior to Lock Down for COVID 19 in Singapore, I was recommended to do a Colonoscopy.\nFrom this moment our lives were suddenly turned upside down, I was initially diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer.\nMy Wife and myself struggled to process this, I thought this always happened to other people and not myself, and we did not know where to start, extremely emotional situation.\nI was recommended to see Dr Mark Wong at Mount Elizabeth (Novena), and from that moment on having met Mark and his team, we knew that I was in the best care in the world and in extremely capable hands, our concerns melted away, this part is very difficult to describe emotionally. What a fantastic experience, besides the friendly atmosphere from Mark and his Team, the Surgery and after care beyond amazing. I am now fully recovered and owe my life to Mark and his team. Never to be forgotten.\nI still go back to Mark for regular check ups and it is the same feeling as going home.\nMark you are the Best",
