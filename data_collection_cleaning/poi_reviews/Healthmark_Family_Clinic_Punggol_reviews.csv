Norizan Samat,1,"My hyaluronic injection was unsuccessful. After 30 mins & 4 painful tries, Dr Jody Liu had to stop the treatment. He said my knee cap is unsually big (my knee cap is size 40cm) and he is not sure why he could not attempt and there is something wrong with my knee. Dr Jody said will refund me and i thought i will get back my $517 that i had paid. But it was a partial refund & i was still charged $80 for the hyaluronic injection. During my previous consultation which i was charged $41.20, I was not informed there is a possibility of unsuccessful attempt. I end up with a bruised knee due to the multiple attempts. My advise is to go to specialist/orthopaedic surgeon rather than a family clinic.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103803003647130344438/reviews
Sam,1,"Doctor caught me offguard as I did not expect to hear this from a doctor who attended to me today. It was incredulous that the doctor had asked me whether i need MC for today (day of the appointment) even after I had shared that i wasnt feeling well at work yesterday. If my company do not need MC, how am I able to take time off to seek medical treatment for my flu? What a stupid question to ask!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108720640169188552105/reviews
Jialin Chia,5,There is an appt system for advance booking. Be puncture for your appt to avoid long waiting time. Usually you will be able to see the doctor within 30mins. Not sure why others have such a bad experience. The doctors are very thorough with their examination. The staff at the counter are also very friendly and help to entertain or distract my young child when he was cranky.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105662644381988782604/reviews

Kastoori Kalaivanan,1,"Good doctor however clinic system sucks. Waiting time is ridiculous even though we have to make an appointment prior to visiting the clinic. Nurses are not transparent about waiting time. My son was so sick and we waited for about 1.5 hours in total when the nurse told me it's a half hour wait. He was waiting outside the clinic with my helper and towards the end, he came inside to wait with me so it will be more comfortable as he was having a fever and the nurse told us that
we are not allowed to wait inside if the patient had a fever as we will infect other patients.ther
e were only 2 patients
left and they were seated far away from us. Heartless woman!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118272019481635098741/reviews
