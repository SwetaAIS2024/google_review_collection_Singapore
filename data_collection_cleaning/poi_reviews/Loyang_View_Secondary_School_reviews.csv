xann liu,5,"This school has provided us with many activities and opportunities like the Overseas Exchange Programmes, Esplanade Trips to watch plays and Science related Programmes that not only helped me to grow and develop within the school environment, but they’ve also had significant impact outside school. They’ve taught me valuable skills, built my confidence and shaped how I approach real world challenges. These opportunities have definitely left a huge impact on me whether it is learning new skills I could apply for the future I can uphold or the bond I make with friends and I will forever remember them.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110858647603502632048/reviews
Yulia Plank,5,"Thanks to the school I was able to experience many engaging activities that helped me gain useful skills that are and will be useful such as leadership training, Overseas Exchange Program, school based learning journeys and also bio olympiads. This helped me gain resilience and helped me grow to be more willing and enthusiastic to learn and understand. This would have not been possible without the support of the school and teachers and all the memories and learnings with my friends will not be forgotten and will help me to strive in the future.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109211204198831284804/reviews
