Maria Rita Velos,5,It is very a very disabled friendly establishment. I like the toilet with various handle bars on its door. The floor is not slippery. There is a lift. The place is clean all over.  It is easy to get taxis and buses there. Various shops and amenities are available for everyone.Spacious and modern. It is recommended that wheelchair bound persons going to the Universal Studios should enter the Resort's Worlds's entrance rather than the other entry to Sentosa,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117074294288664874951/reviews
