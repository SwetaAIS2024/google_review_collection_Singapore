Qais “Kez” Aziz,5,"Enjoyed it so much we ended up coming again the next day.

Staff are so polite and welcoming :)

It’s super clean here, including the toilet.

The food was mostly delicious (although the chicken tikka panini wasn’t really chicken tikka at all and it was slightly undercooked).

Would absolutely recommend the iced coffees, mango tango, bread and butter pudding and the halibut and chips.

Would definitely come again",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117038104400020862808/reviews
Adlyn AH,5,"Excellent service from the whole team on Sunday afternoon, 20th April. They were managing a big group but still gave wonderful service to the other tables. Hats off to the 2 chefs as well for being able to prepare the orders timely, even though we had ordered after the big group. We did have one dish that came a bit later, but it was no trouble for us and the staff were apologetic as well, during and after as we left. They didn’t have to but they also apologized for the atmosphere being a little noisy.

We really appreciate the warm welcome, amazing service, and attention to detail from all the staff!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105558655639382446510/reviews

Isabella chen,5,"Lovely café that’s usually packed but for some reason came on a Saturday and there were a couple of places. Usually there’s a waitlist (but it’s not too bad) the prices are really reasonable so probably that’s why.

Ordered the roasted pumpkin and caramelised onion panini and it was delicious! Im not sure about the weird egg white looking thing, personally would have preferred more grilled veggies over eggs and cheese but that’s just me.

It’s a nice place to sit and chat. Also lovely pastries.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108183653579425218635/reviews
