The three popular stalls here are the caifan, fishball noodle and chicken rice. The pancake stall here is also popular. It is opened in the morning and closes by 2 pm. The crispy pancake is really done well. Very thin and crispy.\nThere are 2 other coffeeshops in Elias mall but this is the only one with air conditioner.",

      "text": "The food there is getting more and more expensive. The stall selling drinks has a long queue which you even needs to stand outside toilets. The washing bay is so near to the stall with all soap and dirty plates near to the stall serving table. Unhygienic. The tables are always dirty without clean up. I can see there is only 1 person at plates collection counter without any cleaner coming around to clean the tables. No point renovated but yet we can't eat in clean environment.",
