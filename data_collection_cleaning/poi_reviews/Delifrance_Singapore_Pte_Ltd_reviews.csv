Eugene Cheong,1,"Pathetic food, pathetic serving and ridiculous policies. Went to takeaway pasta at the Westmall branch for my 2yr old as she wanted pasta. Was told I couldn’t buy a kid’s meal because they needed to see my kid first. Even then, there are some who may not want to eat a full meal and a kids portion would suffice. Ok fine never mind.

Ended up purchasing an adult’s pasta for $12 (including adding mushroom). The portion was pathetic and not even 30% of the takeaway box. My kid could finish it and still want more.

If you want to offer kids meals then offer. Don’t use the pretense having to see a kid to make customers pay adult price for kids portions. I doubt there is a difference in portion between the adult’s vs kid’s meal.

You don’t see a certain fast food chain say they need to see my child before I can purchase a happy meal.

Staff herself was dour and gloomy. Like she had not other choice but to be there.

This is why I will never feel sorry when I hear any F&B outlet close. Because usually it’s well deserved for prioritizing profits over common sense.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117390753023097963187/reviews
Premala Benogopan,1,"A not very friendly atmosphere and when I ordered a tea set foe delivery,food arrived as cold including pizzas and all which should be consumed hot.The orange juice contained some weird hair like substance.And best part is the sales personnel whom I conveyed with told me,""strictly no customization""And I was like OKAY!I know that she does not reiterate to me!And best part is that they don't give you reminder emails or sms about the delivery as in is it even on the way or has it been delivered.Nothing!After the delivery has been done,not even a word of thank you or getting us to leave a review to see how they fared.Well fine so here I am leaving a 1 star review.If I could give a 0 star I would gladly give.First and last ordering for takeaway or delivery here!Spent $183 for nothing!Just a waste!Will never spend a single cent in such a horrid place filled with rude staff!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110838290559537722123/reviews
