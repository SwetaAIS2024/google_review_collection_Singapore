      "text": "Extremely disappointed with the appointment system for the fetal care centre. Every time we came for appointment, it will take at least 2-3hrs wait. There are so many scan rooms but the number doesnâ€™t seem to move. People who needed the scan are pregnant women and yet I see them waiting so long and sit so uncomfortably due to the long waiting time. Seriously no point making it an appointment basis if patients need to wait way beyond the appointment time. It defeat the purpose seriously. Your centre definitely needs some help to come out with a better system. We do not have the whole day to standby here. It disrupts our schedule for the day just spending time waiting here endlessly.",

Sonographer was not friendly the moment I step in and the whole procedure was super painful. There were bearly any communication during the scan. In addition, she told me different things from what the doctor told me which left me even more confused and anxious about my condition.",

At 1130am, the app states that there is one patient in front of me as shown in the screenshot attached. I waited patiently until 1210pm but the room assigned to me - room 9 kept accepting patient whom were late! (9am appointments and such). I know this because i enquired with the counter lady, she explained there were late patient.\n\nThere were five people whom went in alr and I am still waiting!!! So what if other patients are LATE? It is not my fault right? Why penalised someone whom was on time and waiting.\n\nThe system encourages you to be late for your appointment so you can jump the queue and let others wait, because that is what I am experiencing.",

Checked more than 3 times in the counter and each time got the responses saying we are the next one for the assigned room, but we kept seeing others go inside. I seriously suspect many others have jumped a queue in front of us, while we can't be told what was the reasons.",

I asked one of the ladies when would be my turn and she replied after another 2 patient ahead of me. 4 patients have passed....still not my turn.\n\nThis clinic's inefficiency caused me to missed my other appointment for blood test! What is the point of having appointment system, might as well walk in like supermarket.\n\nNUH u can do better since Singapore claims to be world class medical destination. BOOOO!",
