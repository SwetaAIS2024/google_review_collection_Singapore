Ming Hui,5,Finally a luckin coffee opened near my office. It closes at 7pm during weekdays and closed during weekends. So its good enough for me. Its a small outlet but efficient enough to serve the drinks quite fast. I'm a big fan of the vouchers. Have been collecting them weekly. So far I've not paid for a full price drink before. Supportive of such a unique business model.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108198322351045531056/reviews
