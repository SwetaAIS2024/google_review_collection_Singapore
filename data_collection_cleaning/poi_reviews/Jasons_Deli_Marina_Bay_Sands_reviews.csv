A Lee,4,"This used to be on level 1 but has since moved to B2 (likely within Jan-Mar 2025). It’s next to Guardian Pharmacy which is by the food court, at the end of Marina Bay Sands that is near the Art Science Museum; Helix bridge. It offers a variety of groceries and cheap bites like sandwiches, onigiri, sushi, cut fruits and such. Probably the cheapest option for a quick bite in this sprawling mall. E.g. the chicken rice onigiri costs $2.50. A cup of mixed fruits is about $6.90. Queue up for either self-pay credit card/cashless payment terminals or if you must use cash, there is just one human cashier.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104580246569924682783/reviews
Rommmiy kee,5,"I just want to correct some misconception here.

Location: L2 Marina Bay

The shop is at L2 Marina Bay so if you’re searching for this place it is near Casino entrance and you can see DBS bank in front of it.

Price for the item here is quite cheap too even though it is inside Marina Bay.

So if you want to get fruits, milk or even mineral water for slightly cheaper than sundry shop this would be the place because later you can picnic right by the promenade for light and water show at 10PM.

Some pics for you to guide on the location. Thanks",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106124943124283152271/reviews
Graham Stewart,2,"Was approached whilst shopping in Jason's Deli by the store cleaner from Clean Forte, aggressively harassing me to leave the supermarket as I was carrying a take out coffee whilst I shopped. As guests of Marina Bay Sands and a long term customer of JD, I will not be returning. Staff were apologetic, but this cleaner is not helping the store's relationship with its customers.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107508368897714817289/reviews
Duy Ngo,5,"Great supermarket, product price even lower than airport (duty free). Bottle of water is much more cheaper than 7 eleven",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101457047531129611942/reviews
Ezekiel Tanjutco,1,"Hi, I am just wondering if your top management is aware of what the store management is trying to do with their counters as queues build up on the self-checkout counter.

They are blocking three POS machines using a very odd way of blocking them with plastic, a paper bag, or a note (where’s the standards and the refinement) very bad representation to the tourist and local market.

I'm just a concerned party who wants to report this to the top management.

This is a bad impression and very bad handling of floor management when clients are all queuing for business and POS are being blocked for business.

Please look into this Jason Deli management team.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117152486391144208278/reviews
