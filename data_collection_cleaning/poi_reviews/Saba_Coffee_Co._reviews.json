      "text": "Saba Coffee has quickly become one of my favorite spots. The coffee is consistently smooth, rich, and well-balanced â€” clearly made with care. What really stood out to me, though, was the service. On just my second visit, the barista remembered exactly what I ordered the first time and asked if I wanted \"the usual.\" That small gesture made the whole experience feel warm and personal. It's rare to find that kind of attention to detail, especially so quickly. Definitely a place worth coming back to.",
