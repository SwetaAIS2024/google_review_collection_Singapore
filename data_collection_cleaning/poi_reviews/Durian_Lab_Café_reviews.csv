Mabbel Elroy,5,"We had a little hard time finding this place initially because it‚Äôs no longer called Durian Lab Cafe on the signage though the cashier system still reflects the name. This cafe is within the shop ‚ÄúAh Seng Durian‚Äù if you‚Äôre visiting for the first time like us.

We had a single scoop durian ice cream on a cone and it was one of the best durian ice cream we had in Singapore - thick and delicious.

There were many other offerings as well like durian moon cake (not sure if leftover from mid-autumn festival?), puree, flesh etc.

We also bought two boxes of durian back - MSW at $40/box and D13 at $25/box. Gave the D13 away so not sure if it‚Äôs good but the MSW was not bad. Prices are on the steep side for the portion, so may reconsider having the durians if it‚Äôs not within budget.

Overall a nice place to have your durian fix when your craving hits.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102879096020874056848/reviews
alicia tan,5,Nian gao waffle is a must have item. It indeed mixed with with the rich durian icecream. However the place is kind of outdoor thus no aircon. Visit at night can be better as it is more cooling,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108108373578268628597/reviews
Y√®,4,"Sensational good-quality durian cakes and desserts. Coffee and drinks are great too. Decor is chill and relaxed, a great place to complete a meal or have a cooling, delicious treat. The weekend special Kueh Salat MSW cake blew us away with its generous durian cream, kueh textures, and harmoniously fragrant flavours.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110205858157050835887/reviews
CW T,4,"Interesting concept selling durian flavoured tarts, cakes and other desserts. I tried the dark chocolate ice cream and it was good. So were the americano and the affogato. The MSW tart however was below expectations. I would have preferred the durian taste to be stronger and more intense. Instead, what we got was a mild durian shortcake on top of a pastry biscuit.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110213850832346635768/reviews
CK,5,"Nice cozy cafe with good durian dessert! We only managed to try the MSW green bean soup and waffles w MSW ice cream. Absolutely love the MSW Green bean soup! Very thick, creamy and aromatic! MSW ice cream is fantastic. Waffles is great too though I would prefer it to be more crispy. It‚Äôs has a more chewy texture which my friend adore! Friendly and pleasant staff! We went at night and did not manage to try their MSW Kueh Salat as it was sold out. Note to self to go earlier next time!

Update: I finally managed to try their MSW Kueh Salat! It is so good pls. I can‚Äôt even describe. Finished it before I Rem to take photos üôà",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106083249784056867755/reviews
