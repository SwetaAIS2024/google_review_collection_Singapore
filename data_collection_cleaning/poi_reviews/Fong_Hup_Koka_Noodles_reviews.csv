Kim Kim,1,"The food is not cheap, but when a customer asked for a little green onion in the noodles to reduce the fishy smell, they didn't give it to them. The staff said the boss didn't allow it. Wow, green onions are really expensive. The customer wanted to pay extra for the green onions, but they didn't accept it. Bad customer service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107140699821914891153/reviews
Kenji T,1,"I had dinner last Saturday at Fong Hup. Ordered their Seafood Koka noodle, when the food was served after 30 minutes of waiting, I've requested for some chopped spring onions. The answer is NO, we don't provide spring onion for koka noodle, only for porridge. I kindly requested again, their answer is Spring Onion is expensive. I've paid $7.30 for a mediocre bowl of noodle, only to be rejected when asking for a little of condiments. This stall service is really shitty.
Let me add my final point, I do understand that the cost of ingredients are increasing but please don't, don't cheat your customers by using frozen soda preserved prawns.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108066252972261833152/reviews
