Melissa Lim,5,I ordered the classic chocolate fudge cake for my husband’s birthday party. The guests are so happy with the cake and gave good reviews. You have maintained your standard and the sponge is soft and moist. Chocolate fudge is not sweet and well balanced with a bit of salt.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108542582100890554997/reviews
See Ming Jie,5,"Delicious cakes for the café hopper in me! Had the lamingtons and apple pie really recommend that you spring for the Apple pie, it was warm and moist, perfect with a nice cup of tea. Or coffee if you prefer, they have plenty of options.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113385753149112562337/reviews

Keat Tan,5,"Been enjoying Vickys choc cake for several years now, prefer it to Lana's which I find too sweet. This is moist, not too fluffy/dense, not too sweet, not too chocolatey. Sounds & looks very average, but actually hits all the right notes. A good cake to eat regularly (if not for the price).  Good job!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115236427583648412466/reviews
Tarmenz C,1,"Bought a chocolate fudge cake at Bukit Timah Plaza. Asked to take a look at their cakes as all their cakes are in a sealed box kept in the fridge. None was displayed on the glass shelf. The middle aged female staff replied coldly, ""All our cakes are the same"". Home, opened the box, found a shoddy cake with 3 iron press-like on the frosting. Which you can see in the picture. I don't know how you can bring yourself to sell this kind of cake to customers. The appearance of this cake looks far worse than the cakes selling in supermarkets and cake shops below HDB. For the price of your cake, shouldn't you show more sincerity to your customers? Also, the cake has no chocolate taste or smell at all.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107767380196922006565/reviews
