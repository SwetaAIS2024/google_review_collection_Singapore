preba moodley,3,"I recently visited The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at International Plaza, located at 10 Anson Road, #01-32, Singapore. The café offers a cozy and inviting atmosphere, making it a pleasant spot for a quick coffee break or a casual meeting. ￼

I ordered their signature Ice Blended Mocha, which had a delightful balance of sweetness and creaminess without being overly rich. It paired well with their selection of teas, providing a satisfying experience. The staff were courteous and efficient, ensuring a smooth ordering process. ￼

While the seating area is somewhat limited, especially during peak hours, the overall ambiance remains comfortable. The café’s location within the bustling Central Business District makes it a convenient stop for professionals seeking a caffeine fix.

Overall, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at International Plaza delivers consistent quality in both its beverages and service. It’s a reliable choice for those in the area looking for a familiar and satisfying coffee experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115440708151553111297/reviews

Zoe Chong,1,"The staffs here all so rude. Jz shared what had I encountered before. When I wanted to buy coffee early in the morning, got one Indian male staff was hiding inside kitchen, I waited for so long at the counter and no choice u went to knock the kitchen door. Then the male Indian staff finally came out n told me off ""can u wait!"".

The another time I came to buy a cold coffee before I went to work. Since is a cold drink and I still need to walk a long distance to reach my office, so I requested a sleeve for my drink. Then this staff who named ""Hakim"" told me off and said sleeve only for hot drinks and he didn't wanna give me the sleeve. I told him I knew but I just requested to have it cuz there's still a long distance to reach my office. In the end he just gave me the sleeve unhappily. Actually everytime buy cold coffee the staff will give the sleeve, jz that this staff who called Hakim. Really feel like asking him how much is the sleeve I pay ok. Bad experience in this coffee bean",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114769350937722064505/reviews
DR DAVY GOH,5,"Good customer service experience.
Staffs were helpful and patient to explain about the points system.

One of the few places to be open on  Sunday in the Central Business District.
There was a decent crowd despite it was a Sunday.
