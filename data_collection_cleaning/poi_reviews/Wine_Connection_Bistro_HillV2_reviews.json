Despite the busy Saturday night with numerous walk-in customers, I saw them moving swiftly to serve everyone, answering ringing phones, and handling takeaways efficiently. They gave their best effort, and even the pizza servers were polite and tactful. Itâ€™s heartening to still experience such excellent service in Singapore. Kudos to the team",
