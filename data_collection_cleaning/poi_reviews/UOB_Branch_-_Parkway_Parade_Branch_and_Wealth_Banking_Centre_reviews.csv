willie huang,5,"I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the excellent service provided by Ms. Lam Dee Wen at your UOB Marine Parade branch today (19/3/25) 4:30pm.

Initially, my experience was far from satisfactory as I encountered a staff member at the Quick Serve counter who seemed overly engrossed in a prolonged conversation with another customer. This delay left me questioning the definition of ""Quick Serve"" at your branch. I hope the branch management could review this situation, perhaps through the available CCTV footage, to understand it better and ensure improvements moving forward.

However, the circumstances took a turn for the better when Ms. Lam Dee Wen stepped in to handle my housing loan enquiry. Ms. Lam displayed remarkable patience, dedication, and professionalism in resolving my concerns. She not only attentively listened to my queries but also took the initiative to coordinate with her colleagues from another department to provide me with accurate and timely information.

Ms. Lam's commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction made all the difference. She truly exemplifies what great customer service should look like, and I am deeply grateful for her efforts.

Please convey my sincere thanks to Ms. Lam Dee Wen for her outstanding assistance. I would also recommend recognizing her exceptional performance, as it positively reflects on the values and service standards of UOB.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope my feedback is helpful in recognizing and reinforcing the commendable qualities of your staff.

Yours sincerely,

SK Tan,2,"Just want to close my deposit account. Had to come down to the branch personally to do it.

Come down to branch, had to wait for more than an hr before being served.

After savings account closed at a counter, had to wait another 15min at another counter to check that my credit card is also cancelled.

Gosh, easy to put money in, difficult to get it out.

Don't talk about ibanking,  because I cannot access my account online without coming to branch to generate some pins...",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106544570575509432402/reviews
