      "text": "This new store, specializing in traditional handmade noodles, has quickly become a new favorite of mine.   The noodles themselves are a true delight, with a perfect balance of chewiness and tenderness.  Whether you opt for the classic broth-based dish or the flavorful dry variation, the depth of flavors is simply remarkable.\n\nThe Hakka ÈªÑÈÖíÂπºÈù¢ is a delightful bowl of comfort that warms both the soul and the stomach!  The rich aroma of yellow wine filled my senses, adding a lovely depth to the broth.  Each strand of noodles carried the essence of the soup, making every slurp a joy.  The balance of sweet, savory, and umami notes kept me coming back for more ‚Äî before I knew it, the bowl was empty!",

It‚Äôs a balanced serving w egg, anchovies, veg and sauce. The sauce is some mix of soy sauce, vinegar and oil (reminds me of Chinese cooking) and the chilli is power. For chicken cutlet, the chicken is crispy but no chilli. If want chilli top up $1.",
