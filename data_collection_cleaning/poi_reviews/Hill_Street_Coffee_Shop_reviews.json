We had the Crispy fried Lemongrass Nasi Lemak, as well as the Sambal Chicken nasi lemak.\n\nThe portions were generous and the sambal chicken was delicious.  We could not really taste the lemongrass in the other chicken, but it was indeed crispy.\n\nBoth dishes came with iced barley drinks, which were okay, and the portions were smallish.  The keropok tasted a little old and soft though.\n\nOverall it was a decent lunch.",
