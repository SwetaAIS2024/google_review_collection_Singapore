Yummy! Boss Edward also does delivery and glad to see him doing well. Chicken soup provided is made in house and is simple yet satisfying. Will be back when I'm in the area again!",

      "text": "Tried this stall which is currently run by third generation hawker - the chilli packed a punch! 1 plate of charsiew shao rou fan is $5.\n\nThe highlight for me was the siew yoke, the skin was crunchy and lightly salted. The charsiew sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking, but still great anyway. The portion was pretty generous.\n\nExpect to wait quite a bit as it's a 1 man stall. Kudos to the current owner for continuing such hawker heritage!",

      "text": "Succulent roasted meats at an amazing price, with great vibes to boot. Edward is the current owner (his grandfather started Happy World Roast). And the quality of his food is outstanding. He even has specials—his pico de gallo + wonton crisps are even better than some of the chips and salsa in California.\n\nRecommendations:\nGet the char siew. Folks love the crispy roast pork. My girlfriend loves the #8 chicken cutlet noodles.\n\nWhatever you get, you won’t go wrong. But if they have roast duck, definitely go for the duck + char siew combo, before they sell out.\n\nMy only wish is for salad bowls or tacos! Alas, only as specials.",
