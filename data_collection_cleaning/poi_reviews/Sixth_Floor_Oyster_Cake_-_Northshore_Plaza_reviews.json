      "text": "Been going around SG trying to hunt for my best childhood taste & so far, none can beat this shop's oyster cake yet.\n\nIt's crispy on the outside, soft & meaty & full of wholesome goodness inside without too much flour or oil meshed up within the fillings.\nSince I don't really like oysters, the prawn & pork substitute is equally satisfying üíû\n\nEven though I'm weight conscious, biting into this didn't feel as bad as those temporary set up stalls selling hard & cold fried pancakes. Each time I passes by, they are always ready with a few hot or warm crispy crusty fried pancakes. I'm quite sure this is 1 of the best in Singapore.\n\nSo glad I can cycle there to get it whenever I have the craving.\n\nGo go go 6th Floor oyster Cake!!!! üòçüåπüí™üí™üí™",

I heard of the chilli that is very spicy and fragrant, however when I was given the item, it does not come with the chilli. I request for the chilli, and the staff gives me a look of annoyed, I was surprised that they don't give chilli with a portion of oyster..",
