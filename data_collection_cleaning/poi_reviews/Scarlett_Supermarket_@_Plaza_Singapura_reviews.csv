Joey C.,4,"We all know Scarlett but this location unique as it fresh food section inside in addition to the normal grocery stuff. I bought some slice pork and pig ears with slightly spicy mala marinade, small panfried dumpling meat buns, egg chive and meat buns. All nice and good quality and affordable. Highly recommended fresh made snacksüòä",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117248916812976885999/reviews

They have this section at the back where there are stalls selling onion pancakes & spicy Sichuan stuff.
Some of the food items eg canned drinks & haidilao packaged foods were also on sale & prices are really cheap.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117741839812159789392/reviews

Delicious Scallion Pancakes with a Crisp Touch!

I recently visited Scarlett at Dhoby Ghaut and tried their scallion pancakes (Cong You Bing, Ëë±Ê≤πÈ•º). The pancakes were excellent ‚Äì crispy, not too oily, and served warm, especially if you go early, around 11 am. The salesperson recommended adding an egg for an extra dollar, which was a great suggestion and enhanced the overall taste.

The addition of the egg provided a nice richness to the already delicious pancakes. While the food was fantastic, I felt the upsell could be a bit more subtle. Overall, it‚Äôs a great spot for a tasty and satisfying snack.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109157692206723252138/reviews
