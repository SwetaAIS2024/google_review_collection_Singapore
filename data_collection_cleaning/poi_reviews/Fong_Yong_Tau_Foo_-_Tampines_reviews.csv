Shan Leong,4,"The YTF variety was consider alot, can choose with different kind of noodles. I took the Laksa soup based. The taste was good üëç, soup not too thick but flavourful. There are also different toppings and sauce for your selection. This place can be crowded during lunch time. The coffee shop have many seating place and also a lot of parking lot behind. But on the downside this YTF is abit on the expensive side. Overall will recommend to give it a try if you are nearby.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113138367268114769094/reviews
