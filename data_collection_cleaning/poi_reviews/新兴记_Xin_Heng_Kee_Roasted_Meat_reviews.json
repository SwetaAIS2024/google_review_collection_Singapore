      "text": "Had lunch at 新兴记 Xin Heng Kee Roasted Meat and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Char Siew Rice ($3.50) and it was really satisfying — beautifully caramelized char siew that was tender, flavorful, and perfectly balanced between sweet and savory. Portion size was generous for the price, making it a great value meal.\n\nThe stall is popular, so expect a queue during lunchtime, but service is fast and efficient, so the wait moves quickly.\n\nIf you’re in the area and craving authentic, affordable roasted meats, this is definitely worth a visit.\n\nTip: To avoid the peak crowd, try coming slightly earlier or later than regular lunch hours.\n\nOverall, Xin Heng Kee is a solid go-to for a quick, delicious, and budget-friendly roast meat fix.",

      "text": "Seriously nothing to look at but the taste is above average for sure. Charsiew was firm and reasonable quantity given, noodles were al dente n no alkaline taste. Wonton was also above average but the one that impressed me was the price...$4 for a reasonably large portion that was able to satisfy even my usually big appetite. The 3rd was for the value for money criteria this place met.",

      "text": "Saw this newly opened small coffeeshop selling roasted meat while eating at the noodle stall opposite and noticed a steady stream of crowd. Decided to give it a try the next day and ordered the Roast Meat and Char Siew rice. Portion was standard, meat cut into small pieces. Could do better with more sauce. Taste was average. Atmosphere was a non-frill eatery, and the place was clean. Staff were friendly. Okay for a quick lunch.",

Tried braised duck rice and char siew noodles.\n\nBraised duck rice - hint of yam in the rice, duck is tender, mild aromatics, and the duck fats on each slice adds a flavourful fatty taste to it. 4$ for a generous serving.\n\nChar siew noodles - noodles cooked to Al Dante, with a springy texture. Char siew meat is lean, and the amount of Char siew is easily 2x more than regular Char siew.noodle servigns.",
