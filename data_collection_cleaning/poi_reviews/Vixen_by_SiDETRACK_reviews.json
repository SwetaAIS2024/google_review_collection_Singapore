The baked potato was SO good. The fish used is pollock. No GST and service charge! Will definitely re-visit this eatery.",

      "text": "What I got and what I received was different from what was written in the menu. I ordered a chicken roulade which is supposed to be stuffed with spinach with potato salad and greens. But I got a chicken thigh stuffed with celery and fries instead of potato salad. Would appreciate if I was informed that the potato salad is changed to fries and the chicken thigh is stuffed with celery instead of spinach. Their service isn’t that good as well as when I were still browsing at the drinks menu, the waiter just grab the menu back from us without asking if we are done looking at the menu.\n\nWhen settling the bill their card machine isn’t working so had to pay with cash instead. For those who are intending to go will be good to carry cash in case their card machine isn’t working again.",
