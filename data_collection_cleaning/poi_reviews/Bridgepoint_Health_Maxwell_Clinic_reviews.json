We could walk in without an appointment and the doctor seeing us was the kindest and most  caring doctor we've ever met. It is the friendliest medical office we've ever been to.\nAlso her prices were very fair and as an added bonus they have an onsite pharmacy so we could get all the needed medicine right there.\nWe wish them all the best in the future!\nVery highly recommended!",
