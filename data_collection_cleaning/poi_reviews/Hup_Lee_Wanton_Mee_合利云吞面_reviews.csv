James Ang,4,"You'd think that every wanton mee quite standard one, and in a marketplace food centre like this you'd think aiya also all same, maybe just price difference but damm, are we wrong if you think this way.

I don't know if I'm right, but Hup Lee's wanton mee has this slight hint of herbal taste to it. On the outside it looks the same but when you bite into the wanton, sauce and especially the char siew like eh, not same you know?

Worth it. Don't under estimate the creativity and culinary prowess of the local Singaporeans, my friends. TASTY LA.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100655878992435360282/reviews
Kenneth Tan,5,"Revisiting this market / hawker from my Primary school days. The wanton Mee is better than what I remember it!

The noodles are more to the QQ type, chewy & bouncy sort. They have changed up the type of char Siew that are used. It’s softer now. The stall vendors said that it’s for the community at Bedok, as it’s mainly the aging population 👍🏼 thanks for catering to the masses 🥰

Personally, I prefer the hard & meaty char siew, but it’s a great move by them.

The atmosphere there is what you’d expect from a Singapore hawker center. Lively & buzzing, fellow patrons sharing tables, exchanging smiles & greetings. Wouldn’t exchange this for anything anywhere else in the world ☺️",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110528624870751528904/reviews

Darshiini Vig,5,"I must say, I really like this dumpling noodle, the large one that has 5 big dumplings to enjoy every munch 😁

It’s full of flavour and the dumpling filling is full! This is my 3rd time having to order this meal again and I’m not disappointed, will come again for more 👍🏽",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100868945400884995059/reviews
