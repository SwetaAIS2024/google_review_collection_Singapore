The staff was friendly, and everything seemed to run smoothly. But the highlight of my visit was definitely the doctor. He was very sweet, gentle, and made me feel comfortable. It’s rare to find a doctor who genuinely cares and takes the time to explain everything in such a kind and calm manner. Thank you for such a positive experience!",

I visited slightly after 2pm and left before 2.30pm; meaning my registration, doctor consult and medicine collection was all done in less than half an hour. Doctor and receptionist staffs are friendly and professional.",
