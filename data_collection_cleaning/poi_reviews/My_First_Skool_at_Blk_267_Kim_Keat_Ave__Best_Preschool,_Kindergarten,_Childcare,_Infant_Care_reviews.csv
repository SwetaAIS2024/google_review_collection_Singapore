Wanli Deng,5,"Itâ€™s so unfortunate that I had to transfer my daughter to the nearest my first skool as I am going to deliver soon for 2nd one.

I really love Kim keat branch and ALL the teachers are well professional trained and most importantly they are helping each other to take care all students. Can see the bonding and team spirit among the teachers across all the level!

Special thank to teacher Jeah and Qiu Lao Shi whom take care my baby girl (Playgroup) so well. We as parents can see the tremendous changes for my baby girl Averie!

To Dinah, I would recommend my friends with new born or going PG to your branch!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110442712168122631987/reviews
