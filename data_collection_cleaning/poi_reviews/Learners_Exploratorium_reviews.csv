Muhamad Sharif Khamsani,5,"Learners Exploratorium is fun to be at with the welcoming staff and friendly tutors. What sets them apart from typical tuition centres is through the focused small group learning which helps me and fellow students to further understand on concepts which we were severely lacking.

Tutors shares wealth of knowledge throughout the course of study and cares for my and fellows students' well-being. Plus the centre is spacious and conducive for learning.

I always feel at home here at Learners Exploratoriumand highly recommend that you should pay a visit.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116475909085283950558/reviews
Gerry Chew,5,"This center empathises with and seeks to customise for the individual students’ needs.

I strongly recommend it for parents who seek a partner to co-manage your kids’ diverse academic and extra curricular priorities holistically.

Especially in the cases of my kids with heavy sporting commitments, I appreciate the center’s focus on their overall development instead of just academic pursuits.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100176222010448684938/reviews
