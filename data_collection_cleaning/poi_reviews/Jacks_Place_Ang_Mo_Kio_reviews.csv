Jun,3,Should be one of the longest standing Jack's place is singapore. Love the bake potato with bacon bits done to perfection. Overall food is great and value for money. The salmon agolio is a bit spicy not recommended for children unless you tell the kitchen not to add the chili flakes.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107886663772698444350/reviews

Peter Rock Steady,5,"Still, I like my steak best at Jackâ€™s Place, which has been around for a very long time. Too bad they closed the branch at Woodlands Causeway Point.
They do steak right. Too bad, the daily set lunch does not come in the hot plate nowadays.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112735098010851642789/reviews
Ze Hong,4,"Like many others, I have fond childhood memories here. This is where my late mum taught me to use a knife and a fork. And on this Mother's day, I dropped by with my family after a visit to Mandai Columbarium.

It's a fully packed restaurant on Mother's day and for sure it's no longer the same experience as many years ago.

Thank you and I would love to continue seeing the outlet for many more years.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111222156179169213525/reviews
