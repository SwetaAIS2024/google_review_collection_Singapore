Jason Deng,5,"I had a query on the membership and the manager nurhidayah assisted me and even helped to explain the concept of the membership to me.

Thankfully i was able to have a better understanding of the membership and got my 1-1 deal!

Also great service to the rest of the crew!

Thumbs up!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100446919159181326947/reviews
P Lim,4,"You will be disappointed if you are expecting any sort of service here. You order and make payment via a QR code at your table.

The plates from the previous diners were cleared, but the tables were not wiped. I had to use my own wet wipes to clean the table for them. I should have gotten a discount for that. LOL.

Servers lacked energy and looked like they didnâ€™t want to be there.

We ordered Otah Aglio, Beef Lasagna, and Seafood Rebus Calzone. All tasted decently good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101263776907216625108/reviews
