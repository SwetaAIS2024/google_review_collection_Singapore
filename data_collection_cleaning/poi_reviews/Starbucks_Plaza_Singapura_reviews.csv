May Yee Lai,2,"The matcha was honestly good. But the way they poured the drink made it such that once i open the lid it splashed all over my face n clothes. When I mention to the staff, no apologies was made and they never even offer tissues or whatever for me to clean up. Although they asked if I wanted to remake but then it does not change the fact that it already sprayed all over my clothes. I am not even sure if I can wash this off!!!

the photo of the lid was taken after the incident happened.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115369280418772553743/reviews

Gator,4,"Passed by this Starbucks a number of times and interestingly, this is the first time I visited it. Ordered the usual stuff that I’ll order at Starbucks and as usual, the food standard was good and the coffee as expected.

This outlets seems to be packed most of the time and it was no exception this time when I visited. But good thing is that this branch is relatively big so it wasn’t difficult for me to get seats.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
