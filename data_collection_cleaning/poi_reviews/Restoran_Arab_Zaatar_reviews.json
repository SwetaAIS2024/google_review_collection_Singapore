      "text": "Had an amazing meal at Restoran Arab Zaatar! The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, making us feel welcome from the moment we arrived.\n\nWe tried the Madfoon Chicken, and it was absolutely delicious â€“ tender, flavorful, and paired perfectly with fragrant rice and savory broth, with generous portion.\n\nThe desserts were a highlight too, especially the assortment of baklava and nut-filled sweets â€“ so rich and satisfying! We also enjoyed the Arabic tea, which added a nice finishing touch to the meal.\n\nThe ambiance was cozy and authentic, with beautiful Middle Eastern decor and comfortable seating. Great value for money and an overall fantastic experience. Highly recommend!",

Comes with two types of soup. The Arabic mint tea and strawberry drink were good. They sell arab perfumes too at the entrance. And outside is their kunafa station. Next round, would definitely try their kunafa.\n\nSeating might be a little bit limited although it is 2 storey. Seems like parking is not so direct access. So, we just parked by the road side. This restaurant is definitely our top spot for Arab food in Johor. Will definitely come here again.",
