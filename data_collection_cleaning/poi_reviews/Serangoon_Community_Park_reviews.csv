Freddy Teo,3,"Nice place to jog and exercise but then tracks are filled with mud after some showers and there's 2 exercise corners, the older ones needs revamp as chin up bars and sit up benches are well used and dirty, hopefully they can renovate this place as its quite popularise by the neighbourhood folks here. Thanks You.

As at 23 Oct 2022 update, there's no much changes at this park as floorings are still muddy after rain.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108992740627261982935/reviews

Calvin Choo,4,Pleasant little oasis with eclectic features like the walkway-bridges. Would be great if there were a small area cordoned off to serve as a dog run for the many pet Lovers who live in the area.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101037294789603781390/reviews
