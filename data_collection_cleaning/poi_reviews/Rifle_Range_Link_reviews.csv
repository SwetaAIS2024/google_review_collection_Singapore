Vincent Khoo,3,This path is much closer if you want to go to Mcritchie Tree Top. But the path is quite muddy especially after rain. Quite flat throughout. You will pass by a small stream with rocks so it is kind of interesting. Try to wear good hiking shoes for this track. Parking is quite limited outside.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845981260181580873/reviews
Madden Zayden,4,"It is a place where Singapore's primary forest still exist. Wear good comfortable walking shoes, and insect repellant. You can find many insects especially butterflies in the late morning, monkeys, small birds, lizards commonly seen. Moths and bats and spiders are common sight at night, lucky enough you will see the rare slow loris, the civet cat, the flying squirrel and mousedeer. Visiting at night is not recommended with no street lighting in the area.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113592279444049083696/reviews
