Nigel Kaw,5,"Tempura is not created equal. There I said it. You don't realize the difference between regular tempura and fine dining tempura till you actually come to a tempura fine dining restaurant like Tentsuru. It's not just the freshness and quality of the produce but the attention and care taken to prepare each tempura item. The attention to detail for each step of the process right down to the recommendation of different condiments for each item is wonderful. All of it together combines to an impeccable dining experience that is attentive but not stuffy or intrusive. A truly delicious and enjoyable dining experience. Hopefully, the pictures show how each tempura item was perfectly cooked and how well thought out the progression of the meal was.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103561961915657205716/reviews

Kimberly T,5,"Enjoyed a nice lunch at Tentsuru. All the ingredients were super fresh and the tempura batter was light and crispy. The star of the show is definitely the uni roll.
