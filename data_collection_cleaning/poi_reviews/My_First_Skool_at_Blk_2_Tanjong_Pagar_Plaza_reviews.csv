Justine Lim,5,"One of our best decisions made to sending my child to this branch, compared to another branch.

My wife and I get frequent updates from the class teachers on my child's well-being and I feel that the learning has improved tremendously!

The staff in the centre are approachable and are always smiling most of the time. Thank you for always keeping my kid, happy and safe.

Kudos to the principal and teachers!!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110464328648311651557/reviews
