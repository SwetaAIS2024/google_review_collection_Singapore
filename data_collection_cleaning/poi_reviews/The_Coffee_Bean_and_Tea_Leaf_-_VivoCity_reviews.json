      "text": "After a cable car ride on March 29, we found ourselves in HarbourFront on a hot day, craving a refreshing iced coffee. We came across a promotion at The Coffee Bean for their signature Salted Caramel Latte, available hot or iced, as well as the Salted Caramel Blended. Opting for the blended version, we ordered two, along with a Malibu drink, which wasnâ€™t part of the promotion. While caramel usually seems too sweet for my taste, the salted caramel was surprisingly well-balancedâ€”not overly sweet, but just right.\n\nThis promotion runs until March 31 and is as good as a 1-for-1 deal, making it even more worthwhile. Highly recommended!",
