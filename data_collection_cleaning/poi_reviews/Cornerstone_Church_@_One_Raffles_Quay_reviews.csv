Vincent Chia,5,"With faithful expository preaching from God's Word, sound teaching and warm fellowship, here is an excellent church that adheres to the Westminster Standards. This is not a church that seeks to tickle your ears with what you want to hear. This is not a church that makes you feel comfortable in your sins, apathy and lukewarmness. After all, this is not a fast food restaurant or a Mac-Church. If you want to grow in your spiritual walk, then this church might be for you.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109547742131942862632/reviews
