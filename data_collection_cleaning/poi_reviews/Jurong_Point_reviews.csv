Gregory Athanasius,5,"Jurong Point, As Singapore's largest shopping mall by tenant count, Jurong Point dominates the western region. Its prime location next to Boon Lay MRT station and Bus Interchange ensures easy accessibility for shoppers from all corners of the island.

It is a hidden gem for foodies! With a diverse range of eateries, there's something to satisfy every craving.

From the delectable dim sum at Tim Ho Wan to the mouthwatering Hainanese chicken rice at Wee Nam Kee, the food options are endless. I particularly love the bustling food court, where I can indulge in affordable local delights like char kway teow and laksa.

The mall's convenient location and ample seating make it the perfect spot for a satisfying meal with friends and family.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101240389824842882822/reviews

Victor Goh,1,"Great mall, but this anti-cycling barrier is ridiculous.

Might be better off using push gates still require cyclists to disembark, but at least other pedestrians can easier pass through.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111234692807616168516/reviews
