      "text": "Chin Seng Popiah – A Tasty and Affordable Popiah Spot (4/5 Stars)\n\nRating:\n\n• Atmosphere: 4/5 (Clean and tidy stall with a casual atmosphere)\n• Food Quality: 4/5 (Delicious and well-prepared popiah with a perfect balance of flavors and textures)\n• Service: 4/5 (Friendly and efficient service)\n• Value: 4.5/5 (Affordable prices for the quality and quantity of food)\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nDonkey and I were craving something delicious after dinner, so we decided to check out Chin Seng Popiah. It’s a small stall run by a friendly Chinese lady (who might be Vietnamese) who greeted us with a warm smile.\n\nThe stall is located in the middle of a coffee shop, with a clean and tidy setup. The atmosphere was casual, and there wasn’t much of a crowd when we visited. Despite its small size, the stall offers a diverse menu, including popiah, rojak, traditional and crispy pancakes, and Mui Chee, making it a good option for those looking for variety.\n\nDonkey and I ordered two popiah, one with chili and one without. The popiah was a delightful surprise. The thin skin was perfectly crispy and held together beautifully. The warm turnip filling was sweet, slightly spicy, and packed with a satisfying crunch from the vegetables. The chili sauce added a nice kick without being overpowering, making it the perfect complement to the savory filling. It was some of the best popiah we’ve had in a while.\n\nThe lady running the stall was friendly and efficient, making the ordering process smooth.\n\nDonkey and I were happy with our experience at Chin Seng Popiah. The popiah was delicious, the stall was welcoming, and the prices were affordable. We definitely recommend checking it out if you’re looking for a tasty snack. You won’t be disappointed.",
