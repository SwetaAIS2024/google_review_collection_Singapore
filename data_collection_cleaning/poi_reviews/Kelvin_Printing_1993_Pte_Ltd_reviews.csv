Cedric Wen jun,5,Ordered for a delivery of a calender and had a very tight dateline of 2days inclusive of editing my design and printing it. They've exceeded beyond my expectations and produced the item with quality and with super efficient delivery system. The PIC Ms Ze Ying was kind and extremely thoughtful too that makes the whole process so much more smoother. Great job definitely will return again for more in the future!,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104110205549725106905/reviews
