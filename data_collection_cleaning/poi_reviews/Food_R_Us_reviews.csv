Lim TY,3,"A bit disappointed.  Ordered 5 dishes and mainly chef recommendation. Only 2 dishes are considered to be good.  The other 3, can forget about it.

Char siew (supposing highly recommended) - 1/5. Meat so dry and tough.  No fatty part? too lean.  marination over do it.
Salted egg fish -2.5/5.   Nothing special
Roast chicken - 2/5. Hate the colour of the chicken.  Looks artificial coloring.  Meat so dead.
Tofu with fried radish - one of the good one.  But I don’t really taste the radish.
Egg plant with pork floss - this one not bad.

The chicken taste the most normal and yet most expensive.  Don’t know why.

The service is excellent.

Will go there is I have 25h a day.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110599737546328637233/reviews
Jeena Hey,5,"Came to this restaurant recommended by my boss. I keep bringing friends to try out the yummy food. Today is the last day of Chinese New Year! We had the Yu Sheng with Ice Vegetable—it was very unique and shiok. The pork livers were super delicious, and every dish we ordered was tasty. Just a heads-up, the prawns were quite expensive, got a shock when I saw the bill—$78! Despite that, we had a very happy lunch, served by friendly and cheerful waitresses",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113552326796326120362/reviews
Cherin Lim,4,"Nice cze char dishes here. Very good selection of food to satisfy everyone. All the dishes we ordered are tasty above average, strong wok hei. Price is quite steep in my opinion. No one is grouchy here, extra friendly good vibes! A lot of parking but lack of lifts at carpark. There is a ramp at block 4 (around middle of the block), go up the ramp and u will see a lift. Good for elderly, wheelchair and pram.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111526137060820157495/reviews

顏宜興,5,I was invited to dine in this restaurant again and the food is really delicious and reasonably priced. I have been missing out the good food in the west of the island. The dark coloured noodles are from Kuala Lumpur and they are filled with delicious crispy lard. It was the best noodles I have tasted. I recommend both dark noodles and vermicelli noodles. They are unique and really tasty.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103879247907251815162/reviews
