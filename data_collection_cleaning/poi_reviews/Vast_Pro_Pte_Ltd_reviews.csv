Joshua Tan,4,"Ordered an item on Shopee and chose to have it delivered to this place for pickup. It's a very convenient process, being within a 3 min walk from my place. Didn't realize that it's 24/7 too which adds to the convenience. Fuss free process, just needed to provide the PIN. Entire process took less than a minute.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106073441604064345513/reviews
