Nevertheless, it was still quite pleasant to eat since their ingredients tasted fresh. Would come back to try it Medium Spicy and perhaps other things on their menu.",

      "text": "I would describe as a neighbourhood eatery. The service is good and staff is courteous. I never like Mala pot until i tried here. It very appetizing as i love spicy food. Will be here almost every weekor more if i am not travelling. The other side dishes is good like the smash garlic pork belly, spicy popcorn chicken, century egg tofu, crispy spicy cucumber, etc.\nMy wife will usually order for less oil and less salt. Although i am someone with strong taste bud, the chef can made it with less oil and salt yet maintain the quality of taste.\nI can't compare this to the best mala pot in Singapore, but i would still think that this is value for money. And it is air condition, place is clean and cosy.\nüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",
