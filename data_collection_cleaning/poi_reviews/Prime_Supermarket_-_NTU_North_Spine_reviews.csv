Seah Jia Hui,5,Reviewing the prime for hall 2 as there is no landmark added there. A major upgrade from giant express. Way cleaner and sells more variety of items than giant. Mostly self check out now. And they also have ready made food which is very needed for students who are studying late and eat supper.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews
Shawn Lau,1,"I’m writing to express my concern about a disappointing experience I had at your store recently. While buying groceries, I noticed several promotions in the aisles. However, when I reached the payment counter, I noticed that the discounts were not applied. I brought this to the attention of the cashier, expecting that she would verify the promotion. To my surprise, she asked me to return to the aisle and take a photo of the promotion myself.

Having worked in retail myself, I was taken aback by how this situation was handled. It’s always been my understanding that it is the cashier’s responsibility to verify such details. I didn’t expect to be asked to do this myself, and it left me feeling quite frustrated.

A few days later, I observed a similar situation with a foreign student at your store. In this case, the cashier was kind enough to check the product for her. This inconsistent treatment is concerning, and it raises questions about the store’s policies and practices regarding customer service.

I’m not usually one to jump to conclusions, but the stark difference in how these two situations were handled has left me wondering if there could be a racial bias at play. I sincerely hope this is not the case, but I would appreciate clarification on your store’s policies to ensure all customers are treated equally.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108321245413221653816/reviews
zy. Yong,5,"Very Helpful Staff.

Mr Andrew, the manager of the supermarket, was very helpful when I reported that the item I bought was spoiled. After investigating, he not only offered to refund me but also provided me with some complimentary items as a gesture of goodwill. His attentiveness and willingness to resolve the matter definitely made my day.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117305514751011403251/reviews
Geoffrey,1,"1 star for the kinda products you carry. This is the worst dumplings I’ve purchased ever. The skins just fell off the moment they touched boiling water. In fact they already looked bad before cooking, cracks all over with falling skins. Pls stop importing such low quality products. Given that already had bad experience purchasing supposedly ‘discounted’ price items with marked up retail price here.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118410996700151686433/reviews
