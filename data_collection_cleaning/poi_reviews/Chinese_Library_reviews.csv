黃燕紅,5,"There are many Chinese books, but the location is difficult to find, and it is very different from the location shown on the map. It is located next to the parking lot between Xiaolongbao and the Academy of Social Sciences. You can see it from the small door. It feels very remote and there is no special sign.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108859479324195313331/reviews
