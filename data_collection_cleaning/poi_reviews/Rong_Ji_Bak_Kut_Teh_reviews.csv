Ron Ng,3,"Came by for dinner. Couldn't ordered the prime ribs because it has been sold out. Ordered the spare ribs with You Tiao and rice. Spare rib itself is well cooked, it is easy to chew off the bone but not soft to peel off by the chopsticks which preserves some bite which is preferred by me. Soup is peppery and more on the savoury side to my liking. Overall a robust soup and the owners will refill the bowl when you bring it back for more!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102898821791109530498/reviews
