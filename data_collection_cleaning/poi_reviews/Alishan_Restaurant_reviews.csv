lala lang,3,Food not so nice this is for lavender mrt the koufu there but taste wise I believe other outlet no better.the minced pork rice colour is nice but the taste is lacking. Basically feel like not enough shallot?not immersed enough.  But I quite like the service as I requested more braise sauce and the fufill it. I was expecting tasty food cus this is like $6++I think but tasted like dark soya minced meat.
