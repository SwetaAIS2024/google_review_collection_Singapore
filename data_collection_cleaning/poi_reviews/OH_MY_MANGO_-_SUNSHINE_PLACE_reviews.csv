Nana Lam,2,"Shifted into the area for about 1.5years and thought to give this place a try.

Saw it was offering some cooked food and I ordered the Fried chicken rice(I can't recall)

Presentation of food looked presentable. Portion was decent and the ingredients were pretty much bite size. Lettuce was fresh, 1 boiled egg(would be better if they are Ajitama eggs) and chicken was tender but batter has a little smell. Possibly the oil that was used to fry the chicken, was reused a few times. It will be nicer to have mango salad in the dish.

I enjoyed their Thai Milk Tea which I appreciated that it can be customised in terms of the sweetness.

Jd L,4,"Looks empty when we arrived. There was only another table. But.... Grab orders keep coming in. Delivery riders keep coming in to collect orders. So dun be deceived that no one comes here to eat. Place was staffed by 4 Thai ladies. For a while, felt like we were in Thailand. Bingsu not bad.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115003699534688199669/reviews
