It’s a little hard to spot and there isn’t much foot traffic, so I all concerned about the lease holders there.",

The worse is the pigeon problem, due to too many pigeons, shit everywhere the whole condo and shopping mall , ended up turn into a nest for big flies keep breeding there non stop.  Always got big flies invading the whole Viva Vista Condo and Mall.  Complaints and nobody care and following up.",
