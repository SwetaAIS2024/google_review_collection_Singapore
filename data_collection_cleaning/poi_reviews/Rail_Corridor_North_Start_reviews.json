      "text": "Sunday morning walk. A fresh breathe of oxygen. Took a long stroll from the start of Villa Verde to Marsiling Station. A good exercise. Less than 10 km walk. My watch stopped syncing somewhere along the trail.\n\nRoute is an uneven mixed of gravel, sandpit & concrete. Surrounded by bushes & greenery. You may want to bring hiking stick for safety reason or as a walking aid.\n\nSo far ni sighting but do be careful for morning crawlies greeters for those with faint heart. Good for day walk & not night walk as there are no lamp posts along the trail.\n\nBring water bottle. There is a toilet & water cooler halfway along the Kranji Industrial Park. If you missed it, you can stopby Kranji Stn at the end of the trail walk before continuing to Marsiling Stn.",

Luckily the weather wasn’t too humid. We were greeted with lots of greens. Wonderful trail and hope to complete the whole route next round",
