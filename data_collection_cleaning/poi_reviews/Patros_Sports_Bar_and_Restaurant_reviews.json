From the Indian side, we had fish tikka, butter chicken, aloo ghobi and plain nan. Too much for two persons, ideal for four really. Food tastes decent, that said, we thought the essence of each dish was a bit watered down, and more on the sweet side. Total bill came up to $98. Service was friendly and efficient. Will come back to try the Mexican dishes.",

      "text": "I’ve been to this place quite a few times now and have a decent understanding of. Food is pretty good. Quite tasty Indian cuisine and the Mexican tastes really good as well but isn’t really authentic, although they never claim to be. The staff are also really kind and friendly however they can get a bit overwhelmed and hence take some time to get to you but overall good. In the end it’s a seaside sports bar, but even just going there to eat dinner like how I do is pretty great for atmosphere since the decor, weather and vibe is good.\n\nMy biggest critique of this place is the prices. I know other places which sell every item on this menu for far far less and can even be better. What’s more is that they’ve been lower portion sizes too. In the end the increased price is due to the high demand their high rent for a restaurant at the EPC though so I still do like this place overall and will continue to eat here with my family, just not too often",
