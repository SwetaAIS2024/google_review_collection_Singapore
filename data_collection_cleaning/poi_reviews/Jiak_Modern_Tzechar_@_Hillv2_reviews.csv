Abraham Lee,4,"Managed to walk in on a Sunday night! Place is usually pretty packed for dinner so we were surprised to be able to with one last seat. We were moved to a bigger table midway through to accommodate for more space for our ordered dishes as suggested by the staff which was much appreciated!

Good standard of zichar food as its name suggests and could see why they are a main stay within this hillv2 area. Would probably be back to try out other dishes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
Tiramisooo Tiramisooo,4,"‚ÄúPeople who love to eat are always the best people,‚Äù claims Jiak, a popular halal restaurant serving a delicious zichar menu.

Hard agree, Jiak!

We celebrated Aries season at Jiak and we had an absolutely belly-pleasing meal. From Assam Curry Fish Head to Sambal Belachan Brinjal, we couldn‚Äôt stop nodding in approval. üíØüëç

Also, I‚Äôm really intrigued by the okra recipe. The topping really steals the show!

Edliana Edward,4,"Booked quite late for CNY Corporate Lunch on 13th Feb. Jason was accommodating and even arranged to extend the CNY Specials menu to us. Location was far but no complains as other nearby halal restaurants that offers the CNY specials were all fully booked. Staff were all attentive and helped with the lo hei cheers and well wishes. Overall, nice experience and food served were all piping hot and nice.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104379533528826162087/reviews
lucas kauffman,3,"Food was good staff friendly. The main problem is that they seem to make it a point to squeeze in as many tables as possible. While we were eating there was another table beside us, but the other tables were so much squeezed together that my wife, while we were eating, was asked to stand up and wait aside so they could serve the other table. There simply was not enough space for the staff to get to other tables.

Next time I think better to just eat at home. Anything but a peaceful meal when dining in which is a pitty because the food is genuinely good.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105677457254253451287/reviews
Vincent Khoo,3,Tried them for the first time. Food is ok but portion a bit small. The lala soup is a must order. Favourable and lala is fresh. Kamheong chicken also can make it. The chye poh tofu is a bit small in size but taste still OK. The sour and spicy fish soup ingredients are really too little. Finally the mango ice dessert is really nice with real mango cube at the top. Overall still OK but price is on the high side + portion rather small.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845981260181580873/reviews
