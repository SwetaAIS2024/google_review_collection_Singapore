Leo MarBel,2,"Disappointed by the stingy and small amount of sashimi ontop of the rice. I ordered a Classic chirashi UPSIZE. When you are able to see rice exposed on a chirashi, you know you aren't having a good time. Not worth the price, even though it's not as expensive, i ordered the upsize which evens out the price range and yet it didn't deliver.

The Tom Yam noodles were OK. The herbal soup noodles had a weird taste.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101243462557849171019/reviews
chu xuan,4,"Nice fusion restaurant with a wide range of Japanese and Thai food!

Poke tastes good! I had their yuzu citrus poke which was enjoyable! Fresh chewy salmon, japanese rice, refreshing cucumbers and yuzu citrus for me!

I like their mini bowls selection, $2 for crispy pork skin which was so crunchy, $1.40 for their boat noodles which was okok. The mini pork dry noodles were al-dente and the soup was more herbal so I didnt quite enjoy it. But the mini pork soup tastes good!

They forgot our mini pork dry, but we informed them and the staff was really quick and nice!

I find some of their dishes too expensive. $18 for a meagre plate of crispy pork belly, plus GST and service charge will being you to $20. Other restaurants will be more worthwhile. But their poke bowls were quite nice! They also have frequent promotions like 1-for-1 orange highballs for $22+!

We also had a plate of middle wings for $1! Limited time offer. Super crispy and juicy, with lemongrass thai chilli that tastes so good!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900991350615107188/reviews
aydenzedd,5,"affordable rice bowls and ramens. I see that their prices start from $10.80 and without service charge. I had their truffle bara chirashi don. Very nice. Though I wished they had more sashimis In then. Tonkotsu ramen pork broth was so good too. We finished all the soup! Maki freshly made, my boy love it! Cosy place in the west.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115216386767630751463/reviews
Cchontii P,5,One of the delicious Japanese food. Food are fresh and tasty. Recommended the salmon mentaiko deluxe. Come with free set meal for opening promotion. The food is fantastic as well! Especially the salmon mentaiko as it literary melted in my mouth. Price is reasonable. Service is excellent and the environment is very comfy too!

Food finder,1,"The shop is empty without customer
However when I order take away drink and sitting there for a while (less than 10min) being chased away, reason is because not paying service fee so cannot sit at there
Take note with their unfriendliness",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116429172611223569260/reviews
