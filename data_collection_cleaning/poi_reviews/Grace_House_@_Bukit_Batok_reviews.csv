Yew En,5,"Grace House @ Bukit Batok is truly an all-rounded school that exceeds expectations in every way! The teachers and staff are warm, dedicated, and attentive to the children’s needs, creating a nurturing environment where every child thrives.

We appreciate the school’s weekly portfolio updates, which keep us well-informed about the enriching activities and our children’s progress. The curriculum is incredibly comprehensive, covering academics, phonics, Hanyu Pinyin, science, and math. These foundational skills are taught through engaging and creative themes, ensuring the children are well-prepared for primary school. Knowing our children are in such capable hands gives us complete peace of mind.

The school is not just focused on academics—they also integrate art, music, and physical activities into lessons based on different curriculum themes. Additionally, they offer a wide range of experiences that make learning fun and engaging. Each term, the school organizes excursions that broaden the children’s horizons. Younger kids also enjoy water play every term, which they absolutely love! Festive celebrations and special occasions are thoughtfully planned with meaningful and fun-filled activities, creating lasting memories for the children.

Another highlight is the special project week after each school term, where students engage in plenty of hands-on activities. For example, during a project about wind, the children not only learned about the concept of wind but also participated in activities like catching the wind, flying airplanes, and creating wind chimes. These projects inspire creativity and make learning truly enjoyable for the children.

Both of our children look forward to school every day, and we are deeply grateful for the care, dedication, and creativity the staff put into everything they do. Grace House @ Bukit Batok is truly a place where children grow, learn, and thrive.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114412722607182516524/reviews
