R L,5,"Dr Seah is a very experienced and caring doctor. I first went to see him for an eye infection sometime ago and was treated and recovered from it very quickly. Recently, I finally decided to do Lasik after much consideration. I must say I am very pleased with the result. Dr Seah has been very reassuring throughout and I feel well taken care of.  I have since recommended my family and friends to go to him for their eye concerns.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115875104068673667320/reviews
