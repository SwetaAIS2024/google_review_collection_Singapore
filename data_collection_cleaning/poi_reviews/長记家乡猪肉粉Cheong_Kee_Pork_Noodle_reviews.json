      "text": "They are abit more expensive than the other ba chor mee stalls at $5.50 but they have much more ingredients and their soup is very nice, unlike the pure MSG type of soup. Their own special sauce is quite unique, a tad sweet instead of the usual salty kind, yet not overly sweet. I never liked Bee Tai Mak but I will eat theirs. Theirs is very springy and texture is very smooth. The boss is very attentive and I like their service, but they can be abit slow sometimes. Their location is very secluded though and they are not open everyday. Can add 卤蛋，卤猪脚，卤豆卜 if you like.",

      "text": "The pork noodles here are absolutely amazing! The broth is rich and flavorful, packed with umami goodness, and the noodles have the perfect texture—springy and satisfying. The pork slices are tender and fresh, and the minced pork adds a nice depth of flavor. Every bite is comforting and delicious. Definitely one of the best pork noodles I’ve had! Highly recommend to anyone who loves a good bowl of hearty noodles. Super friendly owners too!",
