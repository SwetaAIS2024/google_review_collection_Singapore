Jun Keat Tay,1,"I have encountered the most unprofessional Relationship Manager since being part of the bank. Please avoid this RM with the name Tan Lian See as he simply pushes all the problems away.

For example, in the recent new notes reservation system, when I enquire about the fact that when I log in at 4.30am to secure my slots and notice that it was fully booked, I was told by him/her that ""My tech team said that you may standby in front of your computer at 2359hrs for the next round"".

Until now, I have been waiting for a proper call back from him. (Tan Lian See) but there is no follow up from here.

I am utterly disappointed with the fact that a reputable bank have hired such an unprofessional and inefficient individual in the company.

If DBS is seeing this post, please kindly do a proper closure on this. Thank you.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107636533000305739653/reviews
