Ong Zhi Yuan,5,"This Yong Tau Foo place was once a standalone store nearby but recently moved into a coffee shop. The standards have thankfully remained as good as it was before. The ingredients remain as fresh, the selection plenty, and the prices still relatively affordable.

However, it's important to note that they fry a lot of the ingredients that would normally be soup based. If you like your food a different way, you will need to state it up front.

Other than that, the food is still delicious, would highly recommend it if you are in the area! 8/10",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104417804420531473764/reviews
GG K,3,"Standards have dropped compared to when they were still located at the shop space by the side of the building.

Portions are very small, and priced at 80 cents each, so it's very pricey. The sizes of some items here are around two thirds the size of other places. Taste wise, there is nothing special to it, the soup is not bad but isn't superb. The environment is also very stuffy and hot, it would be better if they improved the ventilation. Waiting times can get quite long during peak hours such as weekday lunch time.

Overall, I personally would not spend the time and money to patronise this stall. However, if there is no queue and you're craving some yong tau foo, this place is still decent.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113182488876013163119/reviews
jpm,2,"Yong Tau Foo is one type of food that I don't eat a lot of. So I don't have a frame of reference in mind when I say that this wasn't an enjoyable meal.

To start off, I do feel that the value proposition isn't high. I had 8 pieces and noodles which came up to $7+. I can think of many other foods I can enjoy for less.  Unfortunately, the taste was rather ordinary as well.

While I was picking my food, a few house flies were picking too. I guess I'm not so easily gross out. But what I found unappealing was the tofu, it has a sourish aftertaste. Will I be back? ‚ùå",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107587473700248132752/reviews
LP Pua,5,"This is one of the very few Yong Tau Foo stalls that fries the items (those that can be fried), which enhances the taste significantly. The remaining pieces are served in a bowl of soup, while the dry Bee Hoon is served separately. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
