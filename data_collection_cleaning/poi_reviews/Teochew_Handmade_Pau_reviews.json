      "text": "Hope chef can make the ingredient inside the pau more juicy like Tg Rhu Pau or Jalan Besar 新山葉子楣手工包點 johore bahru ye zhi mei Pau. These 2 are my Top 2 in SG.\n\nTo be honest it is quite dry for both Mini Char Siew and Normal Meat Pau with egg. But Bun is soft.\n\nTo me Siew Mai quite good, just nice, not so salty and not so fatty/ soft. But not as firm like some Dim Sum resturant. So it is a good mixture and fats n meat\n\nKong Bak Pau is small and quite little meat. Mostly flour. To me personally I wouldnt mind paying more but must have more Kong Bak meat. 85% of it is Bun & 15% Kong Bak.\n\nBut lets continue to support local food. Hope uncle can take in our review seriously and make it more juicy for the Pau",
