Naya Ong,5,"We got to know Vet Mobile while searching over the internet and engaged with them since 2019.
Our story started from adopting Tommy from SPCA in 2019, and as Tommy is an anxious doggy whom might have been through some unfortunate journey.
Hence, we‚Äôve decided having a vet coming to our home to take care & review Tommy‚Äôs well being is crucial.
Since we have engaged with Vet Mobile, its not returning back. Dr Angeline & Zheng Hao has known Tommy & us since the first day we called for them.
They have both been very great & special people. The way Dr Angeline handled Tommy, making Tommy get used to them are so nicely done.
We were planning to relocate to US and have also engaged Dr Angeline to help out on the pet‚Äôs health exam. Lots of paper work involved and thanks to Dr Angeline & Team professional service & their compassion, we have had managed to complete the task.
There are many home vets around but not many of them were known to a lot of Singaporeans.
I would like to compliment Vet Mobile great professional services, their kindness and great attitude in handling pets with difficulties.
Though we will no longer be able to be physically in Singapore engaging with Vet Mobile , I would say both my husband and I have the blessing & fortunate to have known Dr Angeline & Zheng Hao & the backend unsung heroes of Vet Mobile.
We hope there will be more people getting to know Vet Mobile, a super unique way of engaging your pets with not only medical reviews but also many special tips of how to take care of your pets by Dr Angeline & Zheng Hao.
Thank you so much for your care for Tommy all these years, Vet Mobile ÔÅä

Love & Regards from Colorado,

Ruby Goh,5,"We first contacted VetMobile seeking palliative / end-of-life care for our 15-year-old senior dog, Caro. Over the past few months, they have been our unwavering support through a challenging period of illness for our beloved dog.

Dr. Angeline and Zheng Hao were consistently responsive and went above and beyond to assist us. Their dedication and compassion were evident as they guided us through difficult decisions and provided invaluable advice and care.

During Caro's final days, they ensured he passed peacefully, surrounded by love and comfort. Their presence and support were incredibly reassuring to our family during this emotional time. We are deeply grateful to them for their empathy and professionalism.

My family wholeheartedly recommends VetMobile's services to anyone needing palliative / hospice care for their pets. Dr. Angeline and Zheng Hao truly understand that this is a journey they walk with you, offering compassionate care every step of the way. Thank you for all that you do ‚ù§Ô∏è",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117884958728853653998/reviews
Pearlyn Yap,5,"Dr Angeline, Zhenghao and Mesh are incredibly professional, and they ALWAYS go the extra mile to do their best. It is an understatement to say that they are compassionate and effective.

Thank you so much for caring for my cat, Tobi, being reassuring, and doing your best for every sentient-being that crosses paths with you. You guys are truly the most amazing humans and vet team. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèª‚ô•Ô∏è

PS:
Despite being a lean team, VetMobile often goes out of their way to support their clients. However, they are only human, and can only fit in X-number of clients per day. Therefore, if your animal companion needs urgent support and you‚Äôre a new client enquiring, it is important to know that it is not their fault if they are unable to provide an appointment slot (of ur preference), and that it is OUR responsibility to make alternative plans. üôèüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100146700165843425688/reviews
Eme G,5,"We cannot thank Dr Angeline and Zheng Hao enough for the exceptional care and compassion provided to our senior 15 year old German shepherd during his final days and for helping him cross the rainbow bridge peacefully. Their dedication and kindness made an incredibly difficult time more bearable for us, and their gentle approach brought comfort to our family. Thank you for journeying with us through this challenging period. We will always remember your kindness ‚ù§Ô∏è",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114226716110914271335/reviews
chrisfiona yap,5,"VetMobile has come a long way (I've been a client for a couple of years, sorry for this belated, overdue 5 star rating + review) and the housecall service makes a huge difference for pet(s) who are really ill, or in their senior years, timid, traumatised, feral, etc who do not cope well in a typical clinical setting.

Dr Angeline Yang & Zheng Hao are a great / tag team. They are professional, knowledgeable, gentle, kind, empathetic, sweet, friendly & helpful in so many aspects. Zheng Hao is strong too: the equipment he manages are rather heavy! All my cats & I thank you both so very much!

Not forgetting the backend support team who are friendly, prompt in their replies, and sweet too.

Thank you again Dr Angeline Yang, for the kindness (Cupcake & Chocolat who have crossed the rainbow bridge), and the ongoing treatment for Babie, Munchkin & Pumpkin.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113763720539598498935/reviews
