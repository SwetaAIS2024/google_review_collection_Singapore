E S,1,"Ordered a plate of black carrot cake and saw the lady threw a plate of already cooked black and white carrot cake to re-fry. Just when I thought it would still be ok, to my horror I realised more than half of the food was charred! The rest of the carrot cake was bland as there was no dark sauce added other than those from the pre-cooked. Definitely one of the stalls that I will never patronise again.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107823313758074172925/reviews
