Love them!\n\nThe waiters are quick responding to your needs, even when there were so many guest. Amazed on how organized & fast they are, from those who accepting guest upfront until the “cleaners”.\n\nAmbience are great - fresh flowers on every tables, spotless clean after previous guest, great placing/organized on each type of food.",

We also decided to order light bites to share. We did enjoy the live music which the artist came by and chatted with us for a bit. Would recommend if you just want a cocktail while at MBS.",

This gave us some privacy for those who just want to relax with no eyes looking at you randomly as there are many seatings with normal low sofas or dining tables.\nThis lounge provides buffet tea for the hotel guests too. So it can be crowded.\nThis bar also serves up wonderful range of local flavour infused gin by Singapore Distillery. Good for gin lover. I really enjoyed Singapore sling infused gin on its own.",

We couldn’t help but marvel at the beauty of the voice that captivated the room, leaving us mesmerised.",
