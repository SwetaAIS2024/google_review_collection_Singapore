Nikma Sari,1,"Same experience as many others. Inquired about sales and was rudely shut down by an overweight Chinese woman at 12pm Wednesday October 23rd. After she whispered something in Mandarin to her associate, and they chuckled with smug delight. AVOID! STAY AWAY! BEWARE!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117900153593816094160/reviews
Lesley Tan,1,"Terrible retail experience served by the male sales assistant. We were the last customer making a purchase in the store, was trying out new shirts on the rack, he came back to fold back the shirts with a black face attitude. Even while making payment he rejected cash payment just because he had already settled the cash sales for the day. Thumbs down experience manðŸ‘Ž",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111783149208785233793/reviews
Caren Lou,1,"@Armani Exchange truly terrible retail experience.  Rude to anyone who inquires in the store.

First comment not even a hi.  It ""This item is not on Sale"" ðŸ¤· with a smirk followed by a rude face

I will never go back to this store.  They should learn from your orchard road branches.  If their sales is low then this ia one of the reasons why",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109726639389419912688/reviews
bianca li,1,There this one staff there whoâ€™s quite rude he kept on insisting his own preference instead of listening to the customerâ€™s needs (my husband) he even speak in the language we cannot understand in front of us (mandarin). Lucky thereâ€™s this one malay/indian lady whoâ€™s well trained enough in customer service who assisted us. I have to say that rude guy need some customer service workshop.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108215525943934994300/reviews
