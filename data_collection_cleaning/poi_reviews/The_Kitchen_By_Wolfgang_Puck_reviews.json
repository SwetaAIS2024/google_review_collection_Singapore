The pork ribs was tough, not much meat and too little sauce. The truffle fries were nice though. WP burger, fish & chips and carbonara were so so. Kids pasta was too sour. Coffee is kinda overpriced too.",

So if you are rushing for flight, ask how long the wait is gonna be.",

      "text": "Glad to have been able to try out the Avocado Bread Toast ($24), Steak and Eggs ($28) as well as the Half Chicken Cremolata ($28) on these different visits…\n\nWe actually did like all the dishes served above. In particular, the steak (Steak and Eggs – $28) was flavourful and had the fatty bits on the end. Slightly overcooked but we still enjoyed it with crispy potatoes on the side. Perhaps we should go with “medium rare” next time. As for the Half Chicken Cremolata ($28), it was really tender and moist on the inside as well. Although we would have loved more avocado on our toast, in terms of the taste department, the Avocado Bread Toast ($24) was decent – though we’d unlikely order it again next time due to the close pricing to Steak and Eggs.\n\nDuring our visits, we also got to try the desserts…\n\nFor more details of our visit to The Kitchen by Wolfgang Puck, check out 2bearbear today!",
