Especially Reiven and Chris both helped us tremendously with transport information to Malaysia.\nWe liked the Geylang district, it's a vibrant and authentic neighbourhood with many affordable restaurants. The bus stop is only one minute away, the MRT 12 minutes.\nOur double room was great value for S$90.\nThe only downside are thin walls to the floor, some customers were noisy in one night, but that's not the hotels fault. The electric systems were humming a bit, but nothing to be bothered about.\nWe definitely recommend it.",

The location is convenient, close to a mini market and several dining options within walking distance. The bus stop is also fairly close to the hotel.",

The room‚Äôs decent, the bed pretty comfy, there‚Äôs even a hair dryer inside the drawer, there are water bottles, coffee & tea, water kettle provided in room, and also the bathroom has water heater.\n\nAnother plus point is there‚Äôs bus stop not too far from the hotel, just 2-3 minutes walk. There are many small stores to buy your necessities, snacks, water, etc, and restaurant that open ‚Äòtill night.",

If all you need is the 3 S‚Äôs, then this is a place to be. Clean rooms, sheets, towels and comfortable accommodations. Awesome water pressure from shower and awesome AC.\n\nWe were in Room 309, and yes, it is a wet shower, but the floor is well sloped that the entire bathroom does not get wet, if use the shower curtain properly.\n\nOnly has body wash (no conditioner and lotion) and instant coffee/tea I think.\n\nNo bedside plug ins, so consider bringing an extension cord, though there are 3-4 plugs in the room.",
