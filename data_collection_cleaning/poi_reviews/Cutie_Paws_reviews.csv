Sonia Yim,5,"Super happy with the service! Very patient and accommodating to all my requests and my dog came out super cute after! Had some matted fur and aunty helped me to comb it out so my dog can retain the fur length. Shampoo smells nice, aunty is very friendly, and the shop has homely feels. 10/10 recommended!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106976089896889352828/reviews
