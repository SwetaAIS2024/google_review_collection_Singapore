Dani Baal,4,"Dover Forest West is a wooded area in Singapore, located near the Dover Road region. This forest is known for its rich biodiversity and is a popular spot for nature lovers and birdwatchers. The area is part of the larger Dover Forest, which is a significant ecological site in Singapore, home to a variety of native flora and fauna.

In recent years, the forest has attracted attention due to its role as a habitat for species like the Buffy Fish Owl, which can be seen along the nearby Ulu Pandan Canal. The area is also part of ongoing conservation efforts, with some sections being preserved for ecological research and community enjoyment.

Dover Forest West offers peaceful walking paths, making it a great place for leisurely hikes, birdwatching, and immersing oneself in nature, despite being close to the urban environment of Singapore.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103357020897930875043/reviews
The Roaring Olympian 3Axle,4,"Made my visit on Labour Day, May 2024

Construction and destruction works at Dover forest have made access difficult, with previous trails into the forest, to my knowlege, now sealed off. I had to forge a path from the park connector, up a slope with giant yam plants to reach a sea of grass. I waded through the knee high grass for about 5 minutes to reach the forest and found it...a bit boring.

I am not a fan of plants or insects and was in search of remnants of the Chua villagers, but found little physical trace of their existence. I found 2 concrete well like structures roughly in the center of Dover forest, where large trees from long ago still stood. I noticed that some of the trees looked like they were grown in a row, perhaps they were rubber trees of the former plantation? The 2 well like structures could be wells, or open water tanks, or, based on the fact there's a pair and they were next to what may have been a dried up stream, possibly sewage tanks. Other traces like the middens of trash typically left everywhere were nowhere to be seen here, strangely. I could only find a few small artifacts here like the broken plate.

While I am kind of disappointed, those with a love of nature will probably still enjoy a trek here, as the trees here are of a significant girth and height, truly magnificent trees. Regrettably, they will likely be left standing amidst a sea of concrete in a few more years, given the government's aversion to nature. A visit should be made, while you can, to see this place in its natural, non manicured state.

Update: After seeking my elderly father's advice on the two well like structures, he said that they are likely to be old kampong sewage tanks, as they were typically built in pairs, often near drains. The remnants of pipes inside one of them strengthened the case that these are sewage tanks, plus they are near what might have been a stream/drain to release their contents. Probably best not to fall inside.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107084343119152421778/reviews
ChinLee LEE,5,"A City Forest

My first time to this forest, itâ€™s small and I believed not many people had been explore here as still cannot find the proper walking path inside the forest. During our trekking we had seen quite a bit of big trees and there are a lot of small trees are growing. I over heard from a friend, this forest might be used for future development like building condo in 5-10 years time. Personally I really hope that this will be kept as natural reserved for green environments, felt pain if those big trees (guess some of them might be over 100 years).

This is pretty small forest, you just need 30mins to explore it if you are not busy taking photos ðŸ˜….

Lastly, donâ€™t  go alone as you might lost the way as there are not many trekkers as well.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111216149022449977631/reviews
Chye Huat Lim,5,"The lesser explored forest in Singapore which is going to be gone soon. The forest is true to itâ€™s name and as close to natural as possible due to less hikers coming. There are no visible trails except for the entrance and some exits, this place is only for the experienced.

The ground is covered with leaves, protruding roots, low dangling vines and full of ants. There are also muddy grounds which can be pretty slippery. The environment inside the forest is quite dangerous as there are hazards all over, any miss steps can result in a hard fall and injury.

At some parts of the forest, the bushes are as tall or taller than an average manâ€™s height. I would highly recommend you to be well geared and covered to prevent cuts and bites. This challenging terrain is unique and I donâ€™t think can be found in other parts of Singapore, I felt pretty good and had a sense of achievement after clearing this location. Come challenge yourself before this wonderful place is cleared for residential development from late 2022 onwards.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102201975031751877625/reviews
Francis Goh,4,"The forest is less explore by the public. You will get to see a lot of different kind of trees and how they grow. You will also get to see nice scenery along the way which you will not be expecting. However, do note that there tends to have more webs and the trail in the forest is not so obvious.

A path is built to connect Dover MRT to the private estate. This also split the forest to 2 parts.

The journey starts from Buona vista Mrt and end at Clementi Mrt.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102438070659593110664/reviews
