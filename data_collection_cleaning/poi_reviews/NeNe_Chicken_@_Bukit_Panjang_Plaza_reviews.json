We had to ask him to bring the table next to us and join it with ours.\n\nPlace was empty and now we know why.",

When the chicken was served, they were not hot at all and the meat was slightly on the dry side. We ordered curly fries while at least itâ€™s hot. We didnâ€™t want to feedback to them coz we might not want to return again. After all, there are a lot of other food we can try in BPP.",
