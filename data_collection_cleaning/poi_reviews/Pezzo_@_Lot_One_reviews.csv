Ajam Parjo,1,"Don't bother. Ordered on grab and after 1 hour still in kitchen up till close, did not receive my order. Waste my time. Got the nerve to ask if i can change something on my order and i agreed. In the end i had to cancel because i find that delaying after the shop close is a dick move by the staff. Don't support this kind of unethical business practice. Never gonna support this business again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106684158672049957921/reviews
