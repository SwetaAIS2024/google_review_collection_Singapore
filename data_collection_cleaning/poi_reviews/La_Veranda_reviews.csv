John Morgan,5,"A lovey, quaint and quiet restaurant tucked away in Tanglin Mall. Great salad options for lunch. I chose their 18 ingredient lunch - a bit pricey at $34 but well worth it. Pleasant service, homey and comfortable atmosphere.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111744616898410931875/reviews
Lexi Quek,4,"The food is not the best for the price point and portions served but still, I really love this place! I have been back 2 times in a row - the atmosphere is simply lovely and cosy. The service by Han and his team was amazing as well. Came here to celebrate my birthday and he was incredibly attentive and made sure everything was served right. I will be back again! My favourite would be the chicken pasta and warm salad.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116919357410040979732/reviews
