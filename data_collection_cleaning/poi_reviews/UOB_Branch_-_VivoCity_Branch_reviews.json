      "text": "Ms. Kashturi over at the entrance of the bank was so lovely and hospitable. I never met anyone who gives a better service than her. First, i was served almost immediately. There was one customer ahead of me but she told me to have a seat first and served me immediately after. She is soft spoken and patient and very kind with her words. My issue was resolved swiftly and without any hiccups. She definitely also went the extra mile to update additional things that will help my self service banking needs in the future. Very thoughtful on her side. I am glad she puts herself in customer shoes in order to understand the needs of her customers. Although the interaction was short, the impact was huge. Many props to her for being the face of UOB VivoCity! Keep it up Ms. Kashturi.",
