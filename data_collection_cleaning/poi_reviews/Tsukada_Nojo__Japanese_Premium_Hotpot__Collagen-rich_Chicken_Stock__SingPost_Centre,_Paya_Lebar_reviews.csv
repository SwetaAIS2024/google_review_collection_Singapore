Yee Kam Tong,5,"For quality over Quantity
Australia beef is the bomb, out of the world for the marbling. Vegetables are organic and you can taste the sweetness. Soup dries up quite quickly but you can ask for 1x refill if you got the set, and hot water to add on after. We used out noodles as shimei and the texture was perfect.

What we ordered
1x beef set $85
1x nanban chicken
2x additional servings of Aus Beef",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112451721500510263774/reviews
Ivan Ho,5,"A very quaint and cozy place for dinner.
The collagen broth here is well balanced - not too salty and not too bland. The crab chawanmushi is a must try - the eggs were softer than tofu and it came with a nice layer of crab meat.
Service was impressive - they were shorthanded for the night but the sole-runner still did her best to fulfil all our requests rather quickly. She went the extra mile to drew my parents a chocolate artwork for their anniversary. Made them really happy.
Definitely a place to return to.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115939324888641118075/reviews
mushroom soup,5,"Pretty good food with a filling portion. Grateful for rice options because i prefer rice, and grateful that the rice meal came with the collagen broth, because i do want to eat the broth with rice. Love that the meal came with salad and tamagoyaki.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103763145958425916548/reviews

Faith Joan Chua,5,"Food here was great and I appreciate the hearty portions. Had the beef combo, cheese tofu, thin noodles, vegetable combo, and tomato + white miso for the soup base.
