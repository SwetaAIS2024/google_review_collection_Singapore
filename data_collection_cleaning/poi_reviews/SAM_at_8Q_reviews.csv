T. Spark,4,"There are some nice exhibitions here at the time of my visit five days ago, ticket for 6 local dollars, relatively cheap in local standards.

You can see some artistic videos which are shown as artworks, and also some very contemporary conception and representatiom of different arts. It worths to pay a visit if you like arts especially cinematic arts. But if you just want to see some fine arts, you would need to wait for opening of the other galleries.

The main museum was nearly closed, probably under renovation.There was only a free exhibition there showing the museum history. I don't know why the art museum of such a developed state would be nearly closed anytime!",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111849423711746089352/reviews

J T,5,Great for kids and adults alike with plenty of exhibits that educate and engage. The interactive exhibits are popular. The little cinema on L2 plays short animated films that are rather well made.,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102136104763111141763/reviews
