I think it‚Äôs safe to say my rating for this eatery is definitely higher than its current level.\n\nThe fried egg, stir fried kangkong, Tom yum soup and Pad Kra Pow are all very tasty and close to what you can get from Thailand itself.\n\nSo do give them your support and be objective la, when reviewing hawker stalls.",
