Highly recommended.\nIt has an excellent collection for Christmas.\n\nIt's little different from daiso japan in terms of items and price. Buying something at 100 yen and here at $2 is itself a big transition\n\nMust go",

I asked to change, she just say no physical receipt no way. She doesn't even try and her sulking face doesn't help. If she was friendly helpful at least I won't be as upset. Plus since people do self checkout these days and if physical receipt is needed  for exchange then shouldn't receipt be automatically dispensed?\n\nAnyway bad experience, won't be back.",
