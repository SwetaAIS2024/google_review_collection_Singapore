eva k,5,I just finished my art class with Emma during my vacation in Singapore. I am from Germany and Emma’s art class was recommended to me by a friend’s friend. I am so happy that I signed up for drawing & painting class at this studio! I learned so much and I was able to complete my first acrylic painting! The course made me feel very proud of myself and it was honestly so much fun! Emma is a very skilled artist. Thank you so much!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102088829418312978478/reviews
