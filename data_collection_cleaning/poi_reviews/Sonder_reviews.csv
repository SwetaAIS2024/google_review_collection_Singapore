Jeffrey C,5,"Very nice place hidden away in Henderson. Loved their bread with kombu butter. Bursting with umami. Tried the lobster bisque risotto. I would have liked abit more taste of lobster but overall, still a nice dish particularly when eaten with the prawn. Adding the abalone was definable nice touch. Finally, tried their apple lychee mousse dessert. Overall taste was well balanced (not too overpowering and sweet). Might be useful do consider the eating experience though. The exterior is a little chewy and difficult to cut through. So one may not look so elegant when trying to cut through the dessert. Overall worth 5 stars though.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106833163410885808643/reviews
Siew Mei Low,4,"Their pastries are amazing and certain popular items like pistachio croissants are always out of stock. To avoid disappointment, call to reverse for collection instead. Lunch was pretty good given the price point. Was served focaccia and Kombu butter which is a killer. Too bad that they don't sell the butter unless you buy their bread. Double booked chicken soup was flavourful, Hamachi cucumber with passion fruit dressing was refreshing and the lobster risotto was rich but was expecting more intense lobster flavour and complexity in it. Finally, I love the lemon and Thai milk tea dessert, the layering of taste and mousse texture were perfect.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104644291377109094065/reviews
John Vilagos,5,"I came here with my partner for an anniversary dinner and Sonder exceeded our expectations. As it was a Monday evening, the restaurant was very quiet but the staff were incredibly attentive without being overbearing, striking the correct balance effortlessly.  The food was exceptional and we enjoyed every single dish on the set menu. Some other reviews mentioned that the portions were small but we didn't find this to be an issue at all, struggling to finish the final course. They added some dessert items free of charge as it was our anniversary which was a very attentive touch at the end and made the evening feel special. Overall I cannot recommend Sonder more highly.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111959817401622636931/reviews
Jenna Li,5,"Came here for a short friday birthday lunch with colleagues. Walked-in without any reservations, atmosphere is soft and bright with friendly service staff. The food is really nice and with the price points of the lunch set - it’s very worth for it’s quality  It’s really very filling even when you think it may not be, I almost wanted to buy dessert but we didnt just because of how full we were.

We bought home focaccia bread and their kouigh aman which didnt not disappoint.

Highly recommend to all to drop by!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101525121661487866216/reviews
Ettore Palazzi,5,"I have already been here a few times.
On this occasion we celebrated my son's birthday.
As usual perfect service, excellent food.
Stunning presentation.
I was allowed to bring in a very nice bottle of Champagne La Grande Dame 2012.
(At Sonder they have a 1 to 1 policy for wine)
Very good value for the money as a set dinner for 2 comes at $ 180.00++
They also have a set lunch for just $ 35.00++
Reservation is a must.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113376604624453301626/reviews
