Dtmy lim,5,Very humble and professional owner who has been in the trade for many years. Customers are mostly by word of mouth. Very honest. Overhauled our BMW and they only recommended some things that needs instead of pushing every service. Highly recommend.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107281948968474235172/reviews

oink2005,1,Changed a number of parts saying this worn out and that worn out. Even the car bumper was not fixed properly. I had to fix it myself. Even changed the light saying it will not pass inspection. After two months- car completely broke down with the next repair shop saying best to scrap it. Previous job had been utter rubbish. Absolute rip off.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109928421965142383038/reviews
