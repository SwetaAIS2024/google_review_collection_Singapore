Jeffrey Ng,5,"This is a friendly stallholder , he will recommend their delicious dishes to me with patience , unlike the other stall nearby, was very rude & impatient & tell the customers off.
If you are at this food centre,  go for ADAM’S DELIGHTS , for their mee goreng n Mutton steak, 👍👍👍😋😋😋 Strongly recommended",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114912616060377319836/reviews
Tarcisus Ho,2,"Nothing really fantastic about this stall.

The murtabak was really disappointing. $8 and it is really small. Not very nice as well. Mutton was little and the dough portion was hard.

The Roti John wasn’t very good either. Just comes with lots of cheese, and served with fries and a side of mutton. The Roti John was more bread than egg.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101173729048227239393/reviews
ANSEL CHONG,4,"Had the mee goreng combo which comprises of red sauce mutton, fried mee goreng and cheese fries.  The mee goreng is done pretty well, abit charred kind which adds alot of flavour (some like it some don't), don't really like the cheese fries and mutton that comes with it.
