      "text": "Umami Pastrami & Hot Honey Chicken\n\nPastrami is good. For someone who don't fancy smoked salmon, this is a good alternative. I really enjoyed it. Scallion Cream Cheese goes really well together.\n\nAs for Hot Honey Chicken, I had my reservation. It was quite a messy bagel to eat and I can't really decide if I like it or not. It was just okay.\n\nSesame Bagels were really tough. But still okay la. Quite happy to have bagels option in this area. Perhaps the only downside was the wait. I had to wait quite a while because it was only manned by one person. However, I would go back to try the other stuff.",

With the accessible location right by the escalator this shop is a must visit.",

      "text": "Having myself tried to make a smoked salmon bagel I can safely say I should leave it to the experts at Another Bean to make a better one. The lox is some sort of a masterpiece. Get the all in bagel option to have a sophisticated mix of flavours harmonising right in your mouth. I was for a moment ratatouille tasting fireworks (YouTube \"ratatouille tasting fireworks strawberry and cheese\").\n\nThe big problem here is when paired with the iced white peach jasmine tea, the whole experience feels so good, so relaxing that going back to work after becomes even more dreadful. But perhaps one could find solace that the next experience doesn't need to be so far away.\n\n5/5 for taste, value and service! Will be back for more life disrupting bagels soon!",

The lox and umami salami (loved the scallion cream cheese) were my favourites. As u can see, they donâ€™t skimp on the cream cheese.",
