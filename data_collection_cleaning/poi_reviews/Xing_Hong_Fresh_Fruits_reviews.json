However, one of the cherries I ordered came in a bad condition (refer pics).\n\nCalled & had a discussion with seller & his attitude was extremely bad - He was rude & arrogant & did not make an effort for customer service.\n\nEssentially, the point made was he felt the Chile Rainer cherries were acceptable/normal & that I did not know about the cherries. He hung up abruptly at the end, telling me to go down by today to settle the issue.\n\nVery disappointing experience & definitely will not recommend this shop.",

Not sweet, damaged fruits, so so quality...\n\nSave your money, you can buy better quality fruits from Cold Storge easily and even cheaper with the same fruits they were selling.",

He is such an amazing person as he will go all the way out to answer all my queries even though it is already past midnight.    I hereby thank Eric very much for going above n beyond.   Eric is a hardworking n  enterprising young man who has built his business in a very honest manner.  I hv written my order wrongly as 7 lemons for $10  but Eric will bill me according to his price of 10 lemons for $7 instead.  My order of strawberries was very fresh n sweet.   Keep up yr good work Eric.  I will support u all the way! 加油!",
