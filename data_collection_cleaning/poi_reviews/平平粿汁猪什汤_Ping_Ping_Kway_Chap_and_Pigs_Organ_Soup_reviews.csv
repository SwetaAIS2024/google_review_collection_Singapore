LP Pua,4,"I ordered the $4 kway chap set less pig skin because I don't enjoy pig skin. It was good but could have been better if they had added salted vegetables (standard for other kway chap stalls). I am particular about intestine smell, and this stall managed to remove the smell to the minimum, close to no intestine smell. Overall, it was a simple yet enjoyable lunch meal.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Jo L,1,"Ordered a one-person share of kway chap (total $3.50). Taste average, passable but not entirely satisfying.

Too stingy on the intestine and meat, but extremely generous on pig skin and tofu pieces.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115792123775092035556/reviews
Wilson Foo,4,"There are two Kway Chap stalls at West Coast Square Market and Food Center. One also sells duck rice and the other sells pork trotters rice. This is a review of the latter.

Order kway chap for two persons. The kway was not as silky as I would have liked. The pork offals did not have any funky taste though and was well braised. I especially liked the preserved vegetables as it was savoury and sour, just the way I liked it.

All together not too bad. If you don‚Äôt plan to order duck or you only want pork trotters rice, can consider this stall. Especially if you cannot afford the time to queue.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263857328212431619/reviews
Alvin Choo,4,The pork organ soup was alright. Tasted sourish on my first sip but it was because of the preserved vegetables inside. The pork lived was cooked just right. The lor zup was kind of plain.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
