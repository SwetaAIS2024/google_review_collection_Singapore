      "text": "Now, I am attending LCCI at JE. David Wong is a fantastic lecturer, especially if you're focused on doing well in exams. He teaches the material in a way that's easy to grasp and remember, and his funny approach keeps you engaged.\nHe also provides specific and helpful exam tips and clear strategies for understanding his lessons and preparing for assessments.\nThe school's facilities are also a great asset. The only minor issue I've noticed is that some of the monitors can experience a little lag. Regardless, David is definitely a lecturer who helps you feel ready for anything!",

They mix 5 students with 5 different levels in one class. Had i not complaint because on the first day the teacher ignored me completely, i wouldnt have anything to do. After they changed the teacher, she couldnt even speak english! WTH. Imagine trying to communicate with chinese who doesnt speak english who tries to teach you chinese language!\nAnd when we complain, they only said that they have told that there are different levels in the class.\nThe building is so old and sucks. The staffs dont have any interest in helping us.",
