Cheng Han Chua,4,"I had the signature noodle and the noodles with vinegar, tomato and chilli sauce (this combi is a must have).

It is quite tasty and worth it for the price; when add mince meat they actually add quite a big portion.

Worth a try!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117114158221155370806/reviews
Jasper Teiw,1,"Similar to other reviews, the queue process and service is super slow. There was no queue when I ordered a bowl of noodles, and I ended up waiting for 20 mins because they were busy doing takeaways. They prioritise takeaways rather than a customer waiting before them.

But gotta admit that their noodles were very chewy and seasoning was on point. But it's really not worth a 20 mins wait.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115866313306662601048/reviews
Aik Keong Ong,4,"The fish ball and fish cake are Q and taste good, enough fish content. The dry noodle gravy taste is pretty common, the soup is nice",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113771008387619765590/reviews
Joe P,4,"Compared to some of the other reviews, my experience was rather positive on the whole. The taking my order was cheerful and polite, and I did not have to wait long as I was early. The $4 bowl of dry fishball noodles tasted pretty good (noodles a bit ""QQ"", had sufficient ingredients), and the biggish bowl of soup had a light tasty ""ti por"" flavour.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109325409107438635368/reviews
Sam Wong,4,"Tried their signature noodle(black sauce, thin noodle, $6). Meat portion is slightly big. Soup base and noodle is acceptable. Expect to wait 10-15mins. Overall 8/10.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115694236480258826587/reviews
