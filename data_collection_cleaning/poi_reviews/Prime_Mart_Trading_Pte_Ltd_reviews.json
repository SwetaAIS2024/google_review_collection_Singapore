Upon delivery,  the guy told us to do the  installation ourselves as the hose isn't compatible with the tap so we call up a contractor to get it replaced. However,  we were told its not the case, he simply get it done without having to replace anything. Never buy anything from Shopee Prime Mart trading. The delivery guy scumbags is very unreliable.",
