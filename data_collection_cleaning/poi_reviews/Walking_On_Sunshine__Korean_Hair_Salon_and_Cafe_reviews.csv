Chin Chin,5,"Hair stylist Creme was very professional and detailed with her work. Had a consultation before she decide a haircut for my face shape and head shape. She explains everything clearly. Really enjoyed throughout my haircut. Even the hair wash was excellent, not sure who was it but he was very patient and did my hair wash very well. Overall very relaxing and smooth service from Walking on sunshine. Definitely will come back again :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105522408039308017372/reviews
