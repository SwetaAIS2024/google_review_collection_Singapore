      "text": "My favourite Mee Siam used to be from a Malay stall in Hougang, but they stopped selling it one day. Today, I discovered a new favourite at this Chinese stall specializing in Mee Siam and Mee Rebus. The Mee Siam had a very authentic taste. However, one downside was the portion size, which felt small for the $3.50 price.",

      "text": "Long queue at this stall but moves fast.\n\nMee Rebus: personally I feel it would have been better if the gravy is slightly sweet so that when you squeezed in the kalamansi it will give a sweet-tangy taste.\n\nMee Siam: the gravy is light and fragrant but it still lacks the umami taste. And I prefer the bee hoon not bitsy type but in long strands.\n\nI ordered both large plates but the amount given seems to be a small size rather. I can only imagine what their small size is like.",

What a bummer!\n\nBut young boss told me will make a small batch for remaining clients and come back 15mins.\n\nGreat service I feel.\n\nTaste of MS still as lovely as ever,  but the last plate could be a bit cold and diluted.",

That’s it.\n\nThe rice noodle in mee siam is soft, and chewy. Good that it does not get too soft. The soup base is a sour and spicy, a typical taste for mee siam. Overall, good value for this plate of mee siam.",
