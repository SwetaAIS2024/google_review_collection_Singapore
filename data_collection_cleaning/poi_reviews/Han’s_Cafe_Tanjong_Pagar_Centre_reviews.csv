Teh C Gao Siew Dai,1,"16 May 2025 update: Waited for more than 30 minutes after ordering before realising staff forgot about my order. This is unacceptable!!!!! The Chicken Chop that finally arrived also tasted as hard as a rock!!!!!

17 July 2023 update: No queue when arrived to order. However queue formed after. Staff were efficient and smooth. Didn't wait long to receive my order.

23 May 2023 - Arrived just before lunch time, so there was no crowd. Ordering was quick and so was the food preparation. As for food quality, it was the same as previous visits.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102646679801920717610/reviews
Teck Chong Law,3,"We ordered the fish and chips set, which comes with a drink, bread and soup of the day.

We asked what was the soup of the day and the cashier replied ""chicken soup"".  But we received mushrooms soup üòÖ, which was actually quite nice.

The two pieces of fish looks like large goreng pisang.  Taste just average.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103886416957126587915/reviews

Bright Eyes,5,"Visit 2:  I came here again today for brunch after my lipid panel at Outram Polyclinic.  Had toasted wholemeal bread with fried egg & cheese in between sliced tomatoes and cucumber.  Its lovely, fresh but the bread is soft, not well toasted. The coffee-C in traditional Nanyang style is aromatic and satisfying.  As good as Yakun‚Äôs and Toastbox, similar price too but coz it is served in a mug, so there‚Äôs lots more coffee to drink here than those served in a small coffee cupüòÖ. The place is more spacious than most coffee places. The setback previously was the unfriendly staff, the older women serving at the counter. Today‚Äôs service staff were young guys who were friendly and jovial. But they need to improve the toasting of bread.  Recommended for nice meals at a good price.

Visit 3: came here today 15/5/24 for lunch. Had Fried Chicken with young ginger with Rice. Chicken serving is generous. Fit for two. Young ginger is old, not young. Tasted quite good. A nice lunch.

Visit 4: came here for breakfast after a medical appointment at SGH. Had curry puff and kopi C kosong. Enjoyed my breakfast.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114200783271279069230/reviews
Sandra,4,"Ordered curry chicken set n chicken stew set. Drinks n soups were collected as soon as payment was made. Main dishes took a short while to be served. Last was mushroom cheese omelette. Fries were freshly-made, so piping hot üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº Plating of chicken stew was v bad. Shd at least wipe d side of plate b4 serving. Curry chicken looked great, but it was quite salty. Rice was a little hard (well-cooked but hard). Soup came with tiny bits of minced chicken, interesting! Salad/Coleslaw of omelette tasted flat ü•¥

Wait staff spoke loudly but was clear n polite. There was a lady staff doing cleaning. Observed that she's v v thorough as she moved all furniture to mop BUT her frequent dragging of stools n knocking into d partition where I was sitting, made me v uncomfortable too. Perhaps she cld be more gentle?",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108444186723547263962/reviews
