Stingray and Kangkong got a good kick in their chilli taste! üëç\n\nCrayfish wise, the crayfish was a bit small and correspondingly the meat was rather small too but the black pepper paste was pretty good! Can give it a try. üòã",

Lastly, the seafood lala was sandy I thought I ordered sand with chili crab sauce. Took the risk because the usual store was closed, but they did not win me over. Overall 0/5 sadly, I have to put at least one star . Goodbye meiqi",

My order of sea snails was thoroughly unpleasant‚Äîcold, smelly, tough, rubbery, and far from fresh. I recommend that the relevant authorities, such as the SFA, investigate the quality of their offerings. I strongly advise potential diners to steer clear of this place at all costs.",
