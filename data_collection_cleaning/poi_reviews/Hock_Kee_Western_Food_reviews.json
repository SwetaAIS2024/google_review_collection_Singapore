      "text": "Super duper traditional kind of western food. It has those old school taste that you rarely find nowadays.\n\nOrdered the chicken cutlet at 8.50, got fries, coleslaw, red beans, a huge slab of cutlet, and 2 packets of chilli sauce.\n\nPersonally, I found the cutlet to be huge, but unfortunately there was no sauce to complement it. Some stalls will provide tartar / mayo sauce.\n\nTaste wise was so so. Red beans are chilled, which is something new to me as usually they are served hot. But I kind of liked it.",

The fries are freshly deep-fried, & coleslaw has a slight tangy-ness to it, yummy! Friendly stallholders, offering old school style dishes. Service is considered fast as dish is only cooked upon order. Came at off-peak hours post lunch, no crowd or queue. Do support them when in the area!",
