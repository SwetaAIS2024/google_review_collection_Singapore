      "text": "Ordered kata toast set, came with soft boiled egged, toast and a hot drink. For soft boiled eggs, they were cooked perfectly and they crack it for you so that’s a plus.\n\nI changed my drink to iced coffee and it’s quite thick and creamy. I saw other reviews complaining about the drink consistency so maybe I got lucky that day.\n\nKaya toast was a little sad. It was two slices of bread cut into half, with a small piece of butter placed at the corner of the bun so it looks susbtaintial visually (as long as you don’t open the toast and check inside). The kaya spread was also pathetic, maybe it’s some healthy living crap but please have that reflected in the price as well. Healthy living includes not having a heart attack from seeing what you get for the price paid.\n\nThe meal was around $6.50, which is quite comparable with other places like yakun. The only thing they need to match now is the toast quality and portion size.",

      "text": "Perfect half boiled eggs, peanut butter toast was decent. The portion for the toast set (toast, 2 half boiled eggs and tea) was just nice for me who was not very hungry in the morning. Macaroni was however disappointing, soup had no flavour and just tasted like adding salt to plain water. Drinks are average. Menu is net price and pricing is typical for a stall in an air condioned place. Hard to find a seat on weekend brunch hours, usually full. Plenty of parking lots at Tampines Hub.",

Hope the management can improve the drinks quality! It’s a pity for such a local brand to not prioritise the quality of local drinks.",
