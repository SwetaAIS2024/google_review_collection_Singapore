I always enjoy the lively and engaging sessions, continue the good work!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103666951358456466382/reviews
Ivan Tan,1,"How can anyone trust them to teach wealth management when they can't even manage themselves is beyond me.

Cannot even confirm class timetable, with multiple reschedules with no notice or reason given, students have to chase for any information at all, and correspondences take up to a month, with no resolution provided.

Very irresponsible and terrible planning on the organisation's part. Many of the students do have full-time jobs and had signed up for the course with the schedule provided at the time to plan for their own time. This has now been terribly disrupted by the irresponsible planning by this institute.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114254487090305836113/reviews
Rupert Mcgrath,1,"Very poor. Numerous emails ignored. A continous chase for course updates. (For courses already paid for). No replies received.

Materials removed from student portal without notice / explanation. Sadly, very unprofessional.

As an industry professional, the WMI approach tarnishes both SG Wealth Mgt sector, and that of the country's brand. WMI is not up to Singapore standards.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108054364914926761011/reviews
