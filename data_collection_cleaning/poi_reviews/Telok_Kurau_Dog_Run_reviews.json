      "text": "This is a great size for a dog run – not as big as the one in East Coast Park but definitely enough for a good run. It's also not waterlogged or muddy like some other dog runs we've been to. The downside is that we spotted quite a bit of dog poop not picked up. It seems like some people may just let their dogs run about in the dog run while they enjoy the park and they don't pay attention to the what their dogs are doing. So I would advise that you tread carefully in the space.",
