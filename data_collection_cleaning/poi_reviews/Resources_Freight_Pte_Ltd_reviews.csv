Y,1,"I encountered an incident whereby one of this company's logistic/courier team reckless driving on the road.

The driver of GR8820U (white nissan van) sped up and squeezed into a merging lane while im infront, he hit my vehicle from the back. While he is knowing that it is a merging lane, he continued to sped up while my vehicle is clear infront.

He is not apologizing nor feeling in wrong.
The attitude is really terrible while this company is in forwarding services, they should ban this driver from harming more people on the road of his reckless and dangerous driving!!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117654154908255768046/reviews
