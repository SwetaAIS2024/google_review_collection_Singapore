Shellen Kiang (Mushroom),4,This is a small vegetarian eatery under a HDB void deck at AMK. Small (only 5 big round tables) space and another unit (another few big round tables) too. But food wise is good. Price is reasonable. Good for small group gathering of below 50 pax.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105990900760129427900/reviews
Chng Lip Ern,5,"This vegetarian eatery is at the void deck of HDB block in mature estate. I've ordered the fried oyster omelette and the curry veggies. Both were tasty except that the curry was a bit oily. Will return to try their other dishes if I'm nearby.

I've visited other Shu vegetarian outlets and based on the 2 above dishes, I have the impression that the food in this one is better, though the dishes offered in their menu are similar.

They have a air con area with round table sear for a larger group, though I took the non aircon table. The open car park is a few steps away.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111557051720322250957/reviews
Ryan Chan,5,"This is our favourite mala spot on the island. They are one of the few spots that serve lion's mane mushroom and after eating terrible mala at ygf and Zhang Liang, it felt even better going to this place.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112829644314615217212/reviews
Peifa Zhou,4,"It's easily one of my favourite vegetarians for me during the 1st n 15th lunar, but it will always be very packed n need to come early. Food indeed is nice. Their yam ring will be my favourite. Butter abalone was very addictive. 3 egg spinach was alright.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108839949234864089751/reviews
Jlor,5,"We had our lunch here.

The restaurant have 2 different units one is open space , another one with aircon but in between them have 2-3 diff store. So if u sit at aircon area u need to walk to another unit to order ur food. aircon area deco with alots crystals , I guess the owner is crystals collector.

Varieties of food and the staffs action fast.
They even selling mala hotpot !
All the foods we tried was very yummy, my kids love it too even jz a first time ate.

Highly recommend this stall !!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104974466203495354099/reviews
