CCS,3,"Another amazing spot in bustling Yishun Town. Kudos to NParks planners who pioneered the concept of linking up the ""pond"" with the park across the road, sand integrating in the Safra clubhouse.

NParks also retained the original trees, shrubbery, and edible roots. During durian seasons, scavengers have been known to hold all-night vigils. Heartlanders can even expect tapioca and various edible greens growing wild here. But harvesting may not be a good idea.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
Low Soon Kuan,4,"I like the pond park as it is near my brother's flat, and I like to come to exercise with Xuan and Yuan, especially when then have exam, this exercise will destress them. People in sports attires walk, jog and run here. Hospital patients are accompanied by family members to come to the park and exercise. Very relaxing and refreshing!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114238281415823050127/reviews
