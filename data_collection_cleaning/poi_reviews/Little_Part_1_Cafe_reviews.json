Though the place maybe a bit small, and if you need a bigger venue, you can try the one at Sunse way which can hold a bigger group.\n\nThe place wide selection of nice food, good service, drinks, and a  comfortable atmosphere to  relax or wind down. If you are a stout lover,  I personally would recommend that you try the \"100 years\" that is a milk stout which is smooth and  creamy, it has coffee, chocolate notes which is something different from the normal stout.  If you ou happen to be around, do give it a try.",

Read that they actually have quite a long history but shifted location over the years. Will be back to try their other stuff.",
