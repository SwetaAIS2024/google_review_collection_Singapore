Charlyn,5,"Your classic Western hawker stall
We’ve patronized this stall several times now, decent yummy chicken chop with pasta, lamp chop was great as well. The portions for the popcorn chicken was a little small but fried well, cheese fries is your classic side, more cheese would’ve been great. A satisfying lunch!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100667749826736824129/reviews
Daniel Sin,4,"Recently ordered their fish and chip and grilled fish to try. Well I am quite impressed and it was quite good especially the grill fish that it was cooked well and has flavor with the brown sauce. Fish and chip is typical but both portion size may be small doe most people.

Ordered chicken spaghetti with cream sauce and spring chicken whole to try. The spaghetti noodle was well cook not too soft, chicken is bland like poach in water and throw into the spaghetti to cook. The cream sauce lacks flavor and not rich, a bit running. However the chicken was good, loved their crispy skin that is packed with flavours and not oily. Worth trying their fried spring chicken!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112598854240446452449/reviews
Shinjuku Jin,1,"Portion became smaller. Ordered chix cutlet rice. Few pieces of chicken on white rice.

Ordered 3 chicken wings. Overcooked with black patches.

I ordered before another lady. End up lady got the order before me.

Went to ask the cashier a male, how come take so long. Give me theory lesson that fried chicken wings takes longer to cook than fried fish.

Wow. Lor wonder my 3 pieces chicken wings was overcooked n had random black patches

Thanks not coming back. Service sucks like the food.

Those ordering from grab, its the same male chef cooking your sometimes under or overcooked fish/chicken. If a chef cant be consistent what he puts out, wonder how he survive so long.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101156722229306016462/reviews
rachel yong,1,"i don’t even cook but i genuinely think i can whip up something more edible than this in 10 minutes
fries lack seasoning more than white porridge, chicken chop as well cooked as a congratulations steak, mashed potato taste blander than my grandma, overall not worth AT ALL",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112293181814417342098/reviews
