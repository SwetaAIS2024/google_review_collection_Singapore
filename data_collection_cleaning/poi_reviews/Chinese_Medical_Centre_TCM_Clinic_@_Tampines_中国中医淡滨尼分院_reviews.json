On both occasions, I had the pleasure of being treated by Wendy. She is incredibly patient and professional, taking the time to understand the details of my condition before providing treatment.\n\nAfter my first session, I was amazed at the improvement‚ÄîI was finally able to lift my left hand again! Unfortunately, I re-injured it and returned to Wendy for a follow-up treatment today. Once again, I left feeling significantly better and with much less pain. I‚Äôm happy to say that I can lift my hand again!\n\nWendy's expertise and attentive care have made a noticeable difference in my recovery. I highly recommend her services to anyone seeking effective treatment. Thank you, Wendy!",
