Forest BK,5,"⛰️Bukit Batok Town Park is also known as Little Guilin 小桂林 because of the majestic rock formation on the tranquil lake that resemble the actual Guilin in China's Guangxi Province.
🏞️Surrounding the tranquil lake waters are expansive lush vegetations and matured tall trees which provide a natural ambience and shady enviroment.
⛰️Little Guilin lies just across the Bukit Batok residential estate.
⛰️It's offers a convenient and serene retreat for the residents living nearby.
⛰️The Town Park is easily accessible by public transport. It is right at Bukit Gombak MRT Station.
📤Bukit Gombak Trail:
📤Bukit Batok Town Park used to have a Bukit Gombak Trail. The nature trail started from Bukit Gombak Stadium and went across Gombak ridge towards Hillview. It ended at Chu Lin Rd.
📤But a landslide occurred along the trail at Chu Lin Road end; and for safety reason, the nature trail was closed off to public access in 2007.
🏞️Fun fact:
⛰️Bukit Gombak and other hills around it, like Bukit Batok and Bukit Timah, used to be a vibrant granite quarry area during its heyday.
🏞️When the granite quarry industries ceased their operations, the abandoned quarries soon became the city's natural landscape and nature parks.
🏞️Little Guilin was the former site of Gammon Quarry which ceased operation in 1984.
It was converted into Bukit Batok Town Park a year later.
⛰️Bukit Batok, which means ""coughing hill"" was derived from the sound of constant blasting of the quarry activities.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews

Sameera Liyanage,5,"I visited Bukit Batok Town Park yesterday around noon, and I was amazed by the breathtaking beauty of this place. With its serene lake and magnificent rock formation, also known as Little Guilin or Xiao Guilin, the park offers a peaceful escape from the bustling city.

However, it’s important to be cautious about the monkeys that inhabit the area, so remember to keep a close eye on your bags and belongings.

The calm atmosphere and picturesque surroundings make it a perfect spot for gatherings and day-time parties with friends. Let’s all do our part to preserve the cleanliness of this place and ensure its enjoyment for everyone.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114983210546019615175/reviews
