Spotted many rare plants, so happy to be able to take pictures. I’m guessing the mister who showed me the plants is the owner, he’s knowledgeable, very kind and humble. Absolutely pleased with my experience here, cannot wait to visit again! Thank you so much!!!",

      "text": "The google map clearly indicated that they were open but now the owner blamed people for not checking their website before going there. Their staff delivering plants to a supermarket even told us their address and that they were closed on weekends. What’s wrong with the owner? Besides, there were no sign whatsoever at their entrance telling people not to enter or they won’t be served. All they did was to get a fierce looking guy staring at us for a minute without saying anything. When we wanted to buy something, we were just completely ignored. All these clearly indicates their mismanagement and hostility towards customers.",

Will go back again to purchase the Kampong Rose :) Also I like the fact that the lady staff knows the names of the roses & all the roses were labelled with their names. So it goes to show this nursery knows their roses :)",
