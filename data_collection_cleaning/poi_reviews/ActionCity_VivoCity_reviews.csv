Han Htun Zaw,3,"Quite a small place.

Went there two times for Sonny Angles. Overall it’s good. But the staffs are not well trained.

My first visit is like absolutely funny. (nov 5) The cashier staff don’t even bother to ask me about anything. He just scanned and tapped them. And put them in a bag. Like literally no words.

Please don’t work in retail and customer service. If you are not interested in it. Thank You.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106820701068213584820/reviews
DR DAVY GOH,4,"Located in Vivocity Mall.
Wide selection of collectible toys- such as Bearbricks.
Always good to window shop at Action City to view their wide range of 1000% Bearbricks. Though this branch is much smaller than the outlet at Nee Ann City and MBS, there is a still a decent collection here.
The bearbricks are sold at a premium price.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100178836333366849641/reviews
