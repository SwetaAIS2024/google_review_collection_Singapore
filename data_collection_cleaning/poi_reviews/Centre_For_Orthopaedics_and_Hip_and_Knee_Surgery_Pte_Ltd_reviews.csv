Danica Gabawan,5,"A very big thanks to Dr Jeffrey Chew! The reviews you've read about him before this are true - he's not only a knowledgeable and experienced doctor (you can already tell from how he explains), he's also compassionate and kind. His nurse assistants (2 of them) are accommodating and helpful - apologies, I forgot their names.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117586473216534766842/reviews
Peter A. Smith,5,"I am a 62 year old English, Singaporean PR, having been fortunate to live in Singapore since 2001.  I consider myself as Singlish.
In my younger days I was an avid rugby player.  At 19 I played for the Yorkshire Colts and was selected for the national squad.  My club rugby was with Headingley, in Leeds.
I have always enjoyed been physically active and maintained a reasonable level of fitness.  I consider not been able to enjoy physical challenges to be a serious deterioration in the quality of my life.
I first met Dr Jeffery Chew when I slipped a disc in 2016.  I was on contract in KL at the time, but chose to struggle back to my home in Singapore, rather than seek local treatment.
I went immediately from the airport, to what is today Parkway hospital.  Within the hour I had been x-rayed, scanned and admitted to the ward.  Shortly after arriving on the ward I met Dr Jeffery Chew.  It quickly became obvious that I had been fortunate in my hospital selection, as Dr Jeffery was an excellent physician and I was in the best of care.
I received traction treatment and with in a week back walking around and two weeks back at work.
A few years later my wife was running in the local park and fell whilst negotiating a flight of stairs, breaking her collar bone.
I immediate sort out Dr Jeffery.  Her collar bone had two breaks and needed to have a metal support fitted.
The procedure was a complete success, my wife was back on her feet in a matter of days.
In 2019 there was an obvious deterioration in my right hip.  Pain was evident with any lateral hip movement or whilst climbing a number of stairs.  Dr. Jeffery recommend an immediate hip replacement.  I had the operation on the 15 August 2019.  On the 16 August I was walking using a zimmer frame and a week later, unaided. 6-weeks later my scars had all healed and I was back doing my normal exercise regime.
On the 30-June-2021, I circumnavigated Singapore on a mountain bicycle, covering a distance of 130km.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115747324810215313496/reviews

Eugene Wong,1,"Dr Yegappan answered with 3 letters to all my questions posted - M R I. He responded simply yes or no to my questions, sniggered with his nurses when I probed in depth because there was nothing he could diagnose without an MRI. Review was done in 8 minutes and that was me asking as many questions I could to understand my problem. 0 Empathy nor care towards his patients. I had knee pain and not once did he bother LOOKING at the knee. Shrugged me off as that I‚Äôm still young. Complete waste of a visit, similar to other reviews posted.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115380022158276285386/reviews
