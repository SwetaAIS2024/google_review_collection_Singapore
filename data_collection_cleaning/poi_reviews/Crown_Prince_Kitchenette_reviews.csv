Kim Jun Hong,5,"I visited this place on a Friday evening during peak hours, and I was pleasantly surprised to find plenty of seating available. Here‚Äôs my breakdown:

üçΩÔ∏è  Taste:
All the dishes were incredibly delicious. My personal favorites were the Chao Ta Mee Hoon and Clams with Garlic ‚Äì both were bursting with flavor and expertly prepared. I genuinely enjoyed every bite.

üí≤ Prices:
For an airport dining spot, the prices are quite reasonable. They‚Äôre just slightly more expensive than what you‚Äôd pay at a typical Ze Char stall in local coffeeshops. Considering the cosy, air-conditioned setting, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs great value for money.

‚≠êÔ∏è Service:
The staff were polite and friendly, making the experience even more pleasant. I also appreciated that there was no hard selling ‚Äì just genuine, warm service.

üòä Ambience:
The restaurant is quiet, clean, and cosy. It‚Äôs a perfect spot to relax and enjoy a meal without the usual hustle and bustle of airport dining areas.

Overall, I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for tasty food at reasonable prices with great service and a comfortable atmosphere. I‚Äôll definitely be back!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115322490341831324881/reviews
jianhao lee,4,"First time trying this brand name. No waiting time on a weekend dinner timing. Greeted by staff and shown to seat. Decent customer service. Place is renovated decently. Bright and clean. The staff will inform you that the noodle and rice portion are meant for single pax but is good enough for 2 small eaters. I like the fried rice, tasty and favorful.  Decent for the taizi bee hoon. Rest of dishes are decent too. A decent and quiet place for chinese food. Price is reasonable in airport context. Overall a pleasant dining experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107431589322877158256/reviews
Kayden Choo,5,"Fulfilling dinner at Crown Prince Kichenette! Delicious food and with good standard.

The place was almost full house on Sunday evening around 6.45pm. The wait for the food wasn‚Äôt extremely long given the crowd.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111046245288496998971/reviews
Gregory Athanasius,4,"Crown Prince Kitchenette is a popular restaurant in Singapore known for its authentic Malaysian-style zi char dishes.

It offers a wide variety of dishes, including seafood, meat, and vegetables, all prepared with fresh ingredients and flavorful sauces. The restaurant has received positive reviews for its delicious food.

While the restaurant currently accepts cash and credit card payments, one suggestion for a better payment method is to implement a mobile payment system and could order via scanning the QR code.

This would offer customers a more convenient and secure way to pay, especially in today's digital age. Additionally, it could help streamline the payment process and reduce wait times, improving the overall dining experience.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101240389824842882822/reviews
Calcen Chan,4,"Tucked away a bit. It was very empty when we ate here before a flight. The food was not bad. The staff was quick and friendly. The price was reasonable. The vibe is casual and quiet.
If you're looking for decent Chinese food and a quiet place to wait in the public area before your flight, this is a good choice.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115834873482306911999/reviews
