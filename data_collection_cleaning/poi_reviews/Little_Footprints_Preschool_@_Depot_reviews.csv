nidhi singhal,5,"I explored a lot of schools in this area, this came up as a great choice. I like the environment and energy in the classroom, Teacher Dhivya, Laoshi, the principal- all teachers are doing their wonderful best to take care of the kids in the best way. My daughter has food allergies and bronchitis, and the way the teachers handle and take precautions and keep me updated is commendable. The school
has many excursions , drama and art programs and celebrations for parents/kids. Will highly recommend.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112011861958595865473/reviews
