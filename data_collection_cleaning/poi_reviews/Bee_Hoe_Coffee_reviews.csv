Rai R.,4,"Lil hole-in-the-wall gem tucked in a back alley in Joo Chiat ‚Äî blink & you‚Äôll miss it. No indoor seats, just a couple of spots outside under a tree, but that‚Äôs kinda the charm. I had the iced peanut butter coffee with oat milk ($6.50) & it was smooth, creamy & hit just right. The peanut butter adds a nice nutty richness without overpowering the coffee, & the oat milk just ties it all together. Chill vibes, friendly crew & defs a cute spot if you‚Äôre wandering the area or need a quick caffeine fix with a twist.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238117502221273545/reviews
Edgar Wong,5,"A hole in the wall coffee place seated in a quiet alley way in Joo Chiat. They do really nice experimentation of different ingredients to create interesting flavour combinations. One of their most popular drinks, peanut butter coffee, is really delicious and has a similar texture and consistency to the famous egg coffee in Vietnam.

If you care less about the origin of the coffee or what moon phase it is harvested at, and just more into how people can marry coffee with different ingredients and create new exciting flavours, do drop by and have a look.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105763342820983373511/reviews
Josephine Tan,5,"Hidden behind a barbershop in Joo Chiat (accessible from the back), Bee Hoe Coffee is a gem for coffee lovers. With its minimalist setup (very limited seating), and cozy alleyway vibe ‚Äî it‚Äôs all about the coffee ü§ì. We had the Iced Drip Black & Iced Drip Milk coffee ‚Ä¶ so refreshingly good! Enjoyed it!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112348698048907176645/reviews
Elaine Neo (Ê¢ÅÈõÅÂ©∑),4,"The peanut butter coffee was the highlight - creamy, smooth, and balanced without being too sweet. The coconut coffee was on the sweeter side, and I think I was secretly hoping it would match the ones I had in Vietnam. It didn‚Äôt quite get there, but it still had a nice savoury edge that made it enjoyable in its own way.

The space is tiny and tucked away behind a barbershop on a backstreet alley which gives it a bit of charm. Worth popping by if you‚Äôre in the area and want something familiar with a little twist.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101260680686655265157/reviews
