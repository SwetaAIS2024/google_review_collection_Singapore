Ruby Jean Tan,5,"It was my first visit at Paragon’s Mothercare which gave me one of the best experiences in this chain so far. Special thanks to Jane for taking my husband and I through the different models of baby high chairs, including the demonstration of dismantling and reassembling the multi-functional ones.

Giacomo Degli Innocenti,5,"Miss Kitty at Mother Care delivered an absolutely outstanding customer experience that went far beyond our expectations.

As two slightly overwhelmed first-time parents, we had an endless list of questions and specific needs, and Miss Kitty navigated every one of them with remarkable patience, warmth, and expertise. Her advice was not only insightful but also refreshingly genuine, often placing our needs as customers above the commercial interests.

It’s rare to encounter someone so deeply committed to ensuring a customer feels supported and empowered in their decisions. Miss Kitty truly set a gold standard for customer care, and we cannot recommend her enough—she is an invaluable asset to Mother Care and a shining example of what exceptional service looks like!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104884650131720918773/reviews
