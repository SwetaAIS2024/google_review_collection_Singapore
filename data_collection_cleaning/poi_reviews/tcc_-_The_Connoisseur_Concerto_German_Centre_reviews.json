      "text": "Super impressed with my dining experience here! Itâ€™s a clear five star rating for me.\n\nFirstly, the price point is lower here and taxes are already included in the price. Hence, whatever amount you see here is nett. Since this is a smaller outlet, the menu is similar to that of an express outlet, where the variety of dishes have been scaled down. However, this in no way affected the quality of the food.\n\nSecondly, the staff members here were friendly and personable, especially this older lady who took some time to talk to us and informed us about the membership promotions.\n\nLastly, the place is clean and nicely maintained. We came before lunch time and had the corner pretty to ourselves.",
