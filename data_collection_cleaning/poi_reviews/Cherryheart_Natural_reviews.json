      "text": "this is my go-to spot for trusted Shopee parcel collection. the lady boss is so organized & efficient that she can find your parcel within 8 seconds upon announcing the collection code... am always in-&-out of the shop fair quickly even there is a Q.\n\ndont think Shopee customers should expect too much in terms of being greeted with sunshine smiling face, making small talk etc.... its not like you bought any items from the shop, + she prob only made a token XX cents per parcel.\n\nMore importantly, her shop is always open Daily, rain or shine.., no B.S lunch break, MIA days etc. that counts for something.\n\n... so many snowflaker in this era: great to know that this gem collection point has been blacklisted by them & they are going to other collection points in the area.",

      "text": "Collected shopee parcel from the store some time ago. Greeted the ladyboss 'Hi! parcel collection'. She was watching her show on her phone and didn't even bother to reply or look at me. I believed that she didn't hear me and I repeated my words again. Then she replied me rudely with frustration asking me to give the pin code. I believe in basic mannerism to at least have the courtesy to reply a person talking to you.  Not gonna do collect at this location.\n\nedit: not expecting a sunshine smiling face, but treat others the way you would like to be treated. Would you like to be treated rudely? Basic courtesy is a way to attract customers to buy things from your shop too.",
