      "text": "This used to be one of the better Hokkien mees around, with lots of flavour and good wok hei on most days. I had not eaten it for a few months but when I had it again today, to my surprise it was very different and really not good.\n\nIt feels like a completely different recipe or chef who cooked it - colour was very yellow instead of the usual light brown-ish colour, and the alkaline taste in the yellow mee was very strong. The broth/gravy was not as flavourful as before, with a weak seafood flavour and no wok hei. The broth also did not cling to the noodles as much as before and was rather soupy, which also suggests that the recipe is different.\n\nThe only thing that felt the same was the chilli, which was still quite bright and spicy, and unfortunately this overwhelmed the entire dish since the other ingredients were not as flavourful.\n\nWill not return again after this time.",
