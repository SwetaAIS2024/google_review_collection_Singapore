      "text": "They have quite a cute shop name. If you do not take a closer look, you might not know they are actually serving Taiwanese food.\n\nTheir food are actually very affordable and the portion is absolutely generous. The braised pork rice is a big portion. Very comforting to eat, slightly sweet, but it taste well.\n\nBig chicken cutlet is great. Not too much flour and you could have a mouthful of chicken in every bite. The chicken is really big and alone can be a full meal for some.\n\nHowever, i find the chicken can be quite salty and if you are eating the whole chicken by yourself, it can become quite Jelak. I strongly recommend sharing the chicken.\n\nOverall, good place to go on a cheat day.",

Funnily, they did the honey glazed chicken really well. I would’ve imagined that they used the same method but with the addition of either honey or salt.\n\nService: 4/5\nNothing out of the ordinary, but everything was smooth.\n\nAtmosphere: 5/5\nAt the dining area, they have these cute light lanterns that really sets a playful mood. And on the sides, they’ll be selling some popular Taiwanese snacks from different parts of Taiwan.\n\nI will be back!",
