Mao Seiken,4,"Good snacks just right at the entrance of bugis street. The staff is kind. Serving time is a bit long, perhaps because there are a lot of customers. The place is small",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112391541252214277058/reviews

Joyce ling,1,"Bad attitude from the short hair girl that is wearing glasses. Giving eye rolls to customers when she can’t even hear her own customers! Will not recommend! So rude! I literally repeated my self three times . I even use my hand gestures to get her easier to understand . But unfortunately she doesn’t lol. Then she gets frustrated and she gave me an eye roll and a huge sigh . After that she called her boss or brother maybe to come listen to what I’m saying. But the way she speaks is like I owe her money. If I didn’t pay for your food yet, I might as well don’t want it already! And your food isn’t even that good to start off with lol. Do I owe anything?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103998054901939549018/reviews
