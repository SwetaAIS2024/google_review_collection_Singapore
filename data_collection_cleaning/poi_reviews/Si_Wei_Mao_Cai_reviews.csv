Behnam Nikouei,4,"I really enjoyed the food, especially the bold and spicy flavors. Initially, I thought the prices were a bit high, but considering the generous portion sizes, they seem reasonable. However, be cautious when ordering, as the portions are typically large enough to serve two people. The dishes were slightly oily, which added to their richness and taste",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104952023441320052962/reviews

Heizhudaddy,3,Heard good things about the place and decided to try with a few friends. Service was good but food was average as most of the dishes were overly salty in my opinion.
