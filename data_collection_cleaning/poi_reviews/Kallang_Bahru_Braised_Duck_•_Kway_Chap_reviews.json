Lastly, the tray return station is located far away from the dining areas.",

The rice is not fragrant, the soup is lacking the dong gui ingredient and the duck meat is on the dry side.\n\nA little disclaimer that we are not familiar with the brand, but I want to do them justice by giving some suggestions to make the dish nicer. If it's a franchise, they could listen. But if it's a branch store, it's going to be harder to implement suggestions.",
