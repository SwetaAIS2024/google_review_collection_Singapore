      "text": "Ming is amazing. Everyone needs to come here at least once! It‚Äôs so rare to find someone with both the expertise and the passion that Ming has. Even at Michelin 3-star French restaurants, when we mention her, the staff light up and rave about Ming and her incredible cheeses.\n\nWe lived in Europe for 14 years, and honestly, Ming‚Äôs cheeses are better than most of what we found there ‚Äî even compared to the best cheese shops. What I really love is that you‚Äôll find cheeses here that you can‚Äôt find anywhere else in the world (like a Swedish cheese that tastes like pineapple!).\n\nMing‚Äôs passion shines through in every way. She doesn‚Äôt just sell cheese. She tells the stories behind them: cheeses crafted in towns of only 40 people, where generations have been making the same cheese. She‚Äôs even hunted down cheesemakers for years just to get a single wheel she believes in.\n\nYou really won't find anywhere else the heart, the love and the stories behind the cheeses you find here. Some reviews have said that Ming is curt. But if you engage her about cheese and wine, she's really nice and you'll find that she has a huge amount of love for what she does which is really inspiring.",

      "text": "Chanced upon this inconspicuous place after a friend‚Äôs recommendation, discovered a hidden gem serving elusive artisanal cheese with liquor pairing! üç∑üç∂üßÄüßÄüßÄ This place is reservation only, and they only opens for certain period throughout the year. If you love cheese üê≠ , you can‚Äôt go wrong! The dining space is tiny but cosy, and the owner will seek out your preferences before recommending their ‚Äúomakase‚Äù complete with wine and sake pairing. Great for hanging out with friends who shared the same fondness for cheese, and chat over some interesting pairing of white wine and Japanese sakes. They are served on platters and you are encouraged to eat in the order and pairing that the owner arranged.",

Great recommendations for cheese (was looking for aged Comte and was recommended fruhlingskase from Switzerland).\nAlso love the giant muscatels which complements the cheese. The shop also has good offerings as other dried fruits, crackers and wines. There‚Äôs an indoor area for customers to eat cheese and drink wine which was lovely, will definitely be back for ‚Äúdine-in‚Äù.",
