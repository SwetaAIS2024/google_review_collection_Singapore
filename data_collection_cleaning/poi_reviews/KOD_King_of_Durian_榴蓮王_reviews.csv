A G,5,"""🌟 A Heavenly Durian Experience at Space@Kovan! 🌟

I had the pleasure of indulging in Space@Kovan's budgetary and premium durian today, and I must say, it was an absolute delight for my taste buds! 🤤🍈 The authenticity of the fruit was truly remarkable, and it was refreshing to enjoy durian that was genuinely delicious with no hint of fakeness whatsoever.

From the moment I walked into Space@Kovan, I could sense their commitment to quality and customer satisfaction. The durian I selected was beautifully fresh, rich in flavor, and had that perfect balance of sweetness and creaminess. Every bite was pure bliss!

What sets Space@Kovan apart is their dedication to providing an affordable yet premium durian experience. I appreciated how they managed to maintain the high standards without breaking the bank. The pricing was reasonable, allowing me to savor this exquisite fruit without feeling guilty about the cost.

The ambiance of the place was fantastic as well, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that added to the overall enjoyment of the experience. The staff members were friendly, knowledgeable, and guided me through the different durian varieties available, ensuring I made the best choice.

Thank you, Space@Kovan, for an unforgettable durian encounter that surpassed all my expectations! I highly recommend everyone to visit this hidden gem and experience the true essence of authentic, tasty durian without burning a hole in your pocket. 🙌🏼🌴

Kim hong Ting,1,"Bought 2 boxes of old tree MSW through colleague’s order as he said he has kangtao for nice durians. Was disappointed as the durian turned sweaty after just a little while. What’s worst was that all the seeds are so huge, I would say only 30% meat 70% seed. Definitely not old tree black gold MSW. First and last time patronising",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107860389425959995586/reviews
