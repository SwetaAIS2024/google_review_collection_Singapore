He had also observed that after the milk foam settled, and offered a top up of milk in my latte.\n\nHighly recommended as a breakfast place to chill and enjoy your breakfast!",

The atmosphere and vibes here really stand out compared to their other locations.\n\nHowever, we were a bit disappointed with what we received after ordering. We missed how Guzman used to include both sour cream and guacamole as part of the meal. Now, guacamole is only available as an add-on, and we couldn‚Äôt find sour cream anywhere on the menu. As a result, the taste just wasn‚Äôt the same any longer..\n\nIn addition to our recent visit, there were a lot of houseflies flying around near the counters, not sure if there‚Äôs proper hygiene in that..",

I actually did not actually expect a response ‚Äì not to mention such a prompt one too. it reflects your commitment to prioritize customers‚Äô satisfaction. for that initiative alone, BRAVO!\nI've returned today to use the voucher you kindly offered, and am glad that the portion of the black beans has returned to the original size! you've def redeemed yourself with your quick actions to earn & deserve a 5-star. keep up the great job!",

Love the pulled pork from gyg usually but this time it was in huge chunks and not pulled.\n\nWe were also given wrong set of tacos (ordered 1 soft shell 1 hard shell, got 2 hard shell). We got it replaced but it was not too crowded at the time so it made us wonder why the food quality was lower than usual.",
