      "text": "I'm not sure if he is a relief or permanent doctor. One of the doctors, Dr. Wijesundera, was completely unprofessional. He didn’t examine me properly or explain the cause of my illness. I had a bad runny nose and a headache, and I told him I had vomited the previous night. Despite this, he didn’t provide any explanation and only gave me a one-day medical certificate. I requested a two-day MC since my job involves attending to users, but he insisted on just one day.\n\nI was very disappointed with his service. The receptionists were friendly and provided great service, but this doctor’s attitude was unacceptable. I won’t visit this clinic again if he is around. Later, I went to another clinic with the same explanation, and that doctor gave me a two-day MC. He also explained everything in detail, emphasizing that even minor symptoms could potentially be serious.",

      "text": "The receptionist and doctors were very friendly and approachable. I have been seeing this clinic my whole life and there were a lot of new patients that didn’t know their medical entitlements. A lot of the patients were foreigners too. Once, a patient was unhappy with the bills and wanted to claim under his company but even though he had all the necessary documents, he still made a big fuss about it. The doctor was even planning to pay for his bills to de-escalate the situation. Sometimes i wonder whether are we the problem instead. Most of the reviews here are not true and here is my 5 stars to their upmost professional service. ⭐️",

      "text": "Really disorganized system. Staff has no way of telling you the expected wait time. Clinic gets crowded but you have to stand in close proximity to sick people to hear the doctor call your name.\n\nAverage wait time is always 30min to see the doctor, and another 15 min for medicine. Once, the staff screwed up and didn't put my name in the queue, and I ended up waiting for 50 minutes before giving up.\n\nMedicine was also ~20% expensive compared to nearby clinics (faith and joy).",
