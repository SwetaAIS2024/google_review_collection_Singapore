Sumudu Vidyalankara,5,"A truly comforting experience at Hotel 81 Bugis

If you're planning a trip to Singapore, I highly recommend staying at Hotel 81 Bugis. The location is great, but what truly sets it apart is the warm hospitality and incredible staff.

I had an unexpected situation on the very first night when my 12-year-old child came down with a high fever around 2 AM. In a bit of a panic, I called the reception to ask for help locating a nearby hospital. That’s when Valarie, who was on duty, went above and beyond.

She not only provided all the necessary details but also promptly arranged a cab for us. By the time I came downstairs with my child, the cab had already arrived. Her quick thinking and calm demeanor were a huge relief during a stressful moment.

Valarie, thank you so much for your compassion, professionalism, and support. Your help meant the world to us, and it truly reflects the kind of service travelers hope for but rarely experience.

A big thank you to the Hotel 81 Bugis team—and especially to Valarie—for making our stay memorable, even in the most challenging moment.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117000723319988561374/reviews
Kate Naval,1,"Absolutely disgusting. Rooms smelled like mold and the A/C wasn't working. If you care about your health and well being, don't book at this hotel.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109537138867417974356/reviews
TC Davis Lau (Teresa),3,"Location is great.  Rooms were simple and non-smoking which we loved. The bathroom was full of mold and they just painted over it, which does not solve that problem. The smell was strong and the ventilation fan was broken. The a/c helped a bit. That was our biggest complaint. The price isn't bad for a Singapore hotel, they just need to fix the mold problem.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110127347002294812262/reviews
Eliya Tze,4,"Sound level is low to silent. Great cleanliness.

*to note: water bottles are not provided for this Hotel 81 location has direct filtered water
**price not as competitive for 2-hour stay explicitly on Sunday (50 SGD); if looking for short-stay that day, you may prefer to locate another hourly stay hotel",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114741384798732278194/reviews
U Weber,3,"Don't book a standard room in this hotel! These are tiny and don't have a window, which is not exactly obvious during the booking process. But the staff at the front desk was really helpful and gave us an upgrade. This room had a window to the backside, but you cannot open it. (Unless you have a little square key and thankfully, one of the previous guests had unlocked it.) The bed itself was ok. The bathroom was tiny again, only one person at a time.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103360358744108993089/reviews
