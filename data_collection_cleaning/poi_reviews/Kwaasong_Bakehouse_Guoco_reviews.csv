Jessica Chew,3,"Located in the basement of Guoco Tower, the takeaway kiosk is interconnected with Tanjong Pagar MRT Station. It is located where the former Flash Coffee used to operate at. Pastries here start off on an average of $5 onwards, and size is relatively smaller than usual.

The Mini Pistachio King's Pie Galette got my attention for its beautiful design and glossy egg wash. It is filled with nutty pistachio frangipane. While the galette was flaky, it wasn't as crisp and pillowy as I expected and the pistachio taste was muted.

The oval-shaped Egg Tart is similar to Portuguese egg tart as it has a flaky and crisp pastry crust encasing an eggy custard. It was pretty average and not worth considering its steep price point.

Among the three, the Taro Mochi Onigiri probably ticked all the boxes other than its unqiue shape. The encased pastry was light, crisp and flaky without being crumbly, and it was a good filling portion of taro paste and mochi. The taro paste was smooth, earthly and lightly sweet while the mochi was stretchy and chewy. All in all, it was a solid good pastry.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104955252990962962119/reviews
