nic lau,5,"The Fly Fish Soup appears simple, but the flavors have remarkable depth.
Bestway Centre is known best for its range of activities such as gym and martial arts, including its infamous remoteness and the reputation is well deserved. However, The souls harvested from the local community, and the bonds are served warm with a tinge of genuine homemade love crafted with real relationships. A host of other goodies, including the worship, the ushers, the tech & projections, the children ministry, and the bilingual service light the beacon in the west offering a home for anyone and their family. The Church is both clean and tidy, despite having limited
space and more brothers and sister can fit inside at one time - “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;”‬‬ and all the staff members there greeted my companions and me with smiles as warm as the mixed rice they serve there.

I would thoroughly recommend Westside Anglican Church to anyone with a heart to find a family. I know I'll certainly be coming back anytime soon. 💙✝️💜",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114592115169999270954/reviews
