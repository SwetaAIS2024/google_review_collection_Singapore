      "text": "$4 for the toast set, $0.40 to upgrade to iced drink.\n\nSet comes with two pieces of kaya butter/peanut butter bread, two soft boiled eggs and a drink.\n\nIce kopi very good, it is thick, creamy and rich.\n\nNeed to crack eggs yourself, slightly undercooked but generally still acceptable.\n\nKaya butter toast was decent, canâ€™t really mess it up.\n\nThe parking around this area is quite limited though, suggest to park at the hdb mscp and walk 5 minutes.",
