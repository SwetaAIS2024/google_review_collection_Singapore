Hidden gem. Their Prawn noodle is damn solid as good as those you can find in Malaysia. Soup base is full of flavors. Prawns are huge.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104258555113765533217/reviews
E.V L,2,"Used to have long queue but now I hardly see people order. No cut chilli, soup base is salty but not flavourful. Pork meat used is frozen and doesn't have the fresh meat sweetness. For $8, I can get a much nicer bowl of prawn mee at another prawn mee stall. Owner will have to buck up in order to sustain his stall at Midview. All the best!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115388541052427892907/reviews
Ojisan “Hiroshi”,5,"Was missing their good old Prawn Mee and discovered they have this outlet since AMK 711 was closed for renovation. And yes, their Prawn Mee was still an ogasm experience for me.

Learnt from Lady Boss that their outlet at 711  AMK will be reopened on 10/10 which is just a few days away.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112623517876975514039/reviews
