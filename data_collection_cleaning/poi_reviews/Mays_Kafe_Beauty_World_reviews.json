Friendly staff as well. Definitely a new favorite place for my local breakfast fix! ðŸ¥°",

      "text": "Super causal place for a quick small meal. Tried for the first time today and definitely not disappointed. Ordered a lemon juice and sourdough bread with butter and honey. The bread was not chewy and was toasted to perfection. The lemon juice was refreshing and just what I needed on a sultry afternoon. self collect style but their service was efficient and I got my bread in less than 10 minutes . Most tables were taken but I was lucky to find one with a single seat.  Overall it was satisfying and reasonably priced.\nEager to try their coffees the next time.",

      "text": "Alright, folks, listen up! Donkey and I were on a cycling trip to Albert Complex for a movie at the Eagle Cineplex, and with a hot afternoon approaching, we decided to skip the hawker centers and head to Beauty World for a quick bite. Donkey remembered a delicious coffee from a previous visit to Beauty World, so he was eager to revisit May's Kafe.\n\nThe Good:\n\nâ€¢ The Coffee: The coffee, however, lived up to Donkey's memory! It still had that incredible fragrance he remembers from two years ago.\n\nâ€¢ The Atmosphere: May's Kafe has a lively atmosphere, and it's nice to sit in the open at Basement 1.\n\nThe Quirks:\n\nâ€¢ The Food: We found a table, and Donkey ordered the Mee Rebus while I tried the Mee Siam, which is their recommended dish. The Mee Rebus was acceptable, but I felt that the Mee Siam was a bit lacking compared to other Mee Siams I had before. We also couldn't resist adding a chee cheong fun and an Orh kueh to our order. I told Donkey that I really enjoyed them on my last visit, but this time, I felt the quality had dropped a bit.\n\nâ€¢ The Tea: The tea, unfortunately, was a bit lacking in flavor.\n\nâ€¢ The Service: There's no table service, so after ordering, you have to collect your food and return your tray yourself.\n\nDonkeyâ€™s Note: I loved the coffee! It was so good!\n\nMy Note: I was hoping for a more flavorful Mee Siam, but the coffee was still amazing!\n\nRating:\n\nâ€¢ Food: 3/5 (Some dishes were underwhelming, but others were good)\n\nâ€¢ Service: 3.5/5 (No table service, but efficient)\n\nâ€¢ Atmosphere: 4/5 (Lively and bustling)\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nOverall: While some dishes were a bit underwhelming, May's Kafe is still a good option for a quick and affordable meal. Their coffee, especially, is a real highlight.",
