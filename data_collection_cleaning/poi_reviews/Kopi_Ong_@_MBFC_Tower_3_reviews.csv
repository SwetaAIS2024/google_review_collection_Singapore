Skye Cai,4,"A little over priced for the drinks.
Good to have one for one on a Friday.
The coffee is strong and decent. Staff very friendly.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Vijay,1,"Once I ordered Honey Lemon tea for 4 dollars, which was costly than the competitor ""OLD TEA HUT""(They charge only 2.5 for no ice variant). I came to realisation that they fill the whole cup with ICE CUBEs. The speciality is they use ice cubes which leave no room for liquid to stay. I will not recommend this shop.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117712395329495636733/reviews

Hope your business last long with that bad attitude of yours!
