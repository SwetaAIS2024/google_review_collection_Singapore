      "text": "came here for grab’s tues dineout deal but think dont come here bahh its really quite overpriced and the food is like meh only caifan standard. the scallops in the broccoli scallop dish was also ridiculously small (understand the image is not drawn to scale in their menu but this is really such a clickbait) when jokingly pointed out the size of the scallops to the staff they also didnt bother explaining / rectifying. and indeed like the other reviewers here - the barley is really very diluted… food was served slow also. overall just a super overpriced (even after my grab discount) and bad experience, will not wish this on anyone. please go eat somewhere else and dont be like me :((",

Food tastes bland so they're definitely healthier for sure. But I wouldn't come back here with my family. However it's a great restaurant for rich Chinese families with elderly. Their customer service is excellent",
