He’s incredibly detailed and truly wants the best for his patients.\n\nBoon took me through a thorough assessment, explaining everything clearly, and provided exercises to work on at home. As a runner, I found the Runeasi analysis especially interesting—it’s packed with data, and I learned a lot about my asymmetry and areas of weakness. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "Great clinic for runners! I recently visited the clinic due to persistent calf pain from my marathon training. Podiatrist Boon Kiak was incredibly helpful in pinpointing the root of the problem through a detailed 3D & video running gait analysis, revealing issues with my running form I never noticed.\n\nBoon Kiak’s knowledge of running and footwear is really helpful too. He took the time to explain my condition clearly and provided tailored advice & rehab exercises on how to improve my running and prevent future injuries. I also underwent shockwave therapy for my calf pain, which was a game-changer. My pain disappeared substantially after just one session.\n\nI highly recommend this clinic to any runner experiencing foot or leg pain. Thank you Boon Kiak for your help!",

      "text": "Boon Kiak's experience and knowledge in this area has been instrumental in identifying the unique cause of my heel pain which escalated and persisted for many months last year. I had been to the chiropractor, physiotherapist, orthopedic specialist with MRI scan but none of them were able to identify the cause and could only treat the symptoms temporarily or offer invasive temporary treatment solution. Boon Kiak was able to tell what was causing the heel pain on the 1st session, and did his best to treat and teach me the exercises I required to help my heel recover. I never thought I could have pain-free days again but he made it possible! Highly recommend! He is always helpful and sincere to address whatever questions you might have.",
