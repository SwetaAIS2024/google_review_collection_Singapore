Dr Lum,2,"Pastamania foods are good but this shop manageress, Dona in black dress, said cannot bring outside when we took only one piece of garlic biscuit to dip mushroom soup for our grandson! see photos.

Gregory Athanasius,4,"Pasta mania stall is located in Viva Business Park. The food is surprisingly serve pippin hot from the oven. The garlic bread is crisp and just right, with a well made mushrooms soup. After the Covid restrictions have been lifted, both food taste and service has been hits-or-missed. At times, the food can be good and other time, the food is just average

I am not too sure about the closing time, but I am satisfied with the food. The service can be further improve by offering advice on what is recommended.

Despite the cost of food has increased, and it would be great to have tie - in rebate. Overall, a wonderful dinner.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101240389824842882822/reviews
