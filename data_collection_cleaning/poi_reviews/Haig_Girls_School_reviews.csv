puteri,3,"im gonna speak from experience . so haig girls school is a wonderful place but tchrs can be biased and mid. the students there are just not it. absolutely TOXIC. principal cancelled sports day and took out some of our favourite drinks and snacks just because some people abused it , i know ... new broom sweep clean but i think that what the principal has done is ridiculous. furthermore pupils in hgs are arrogant and overproud. prefects think their so good in this school. a tchr ignored me when i wanted to ask a question because she/he wanted me to ""try by myself"" and to add on she/he knows that im struggling alot in that subject and thinks ignoring my question is a great idea. but on the bright side , i pushed the fake friends out of my circle and kept the real ones. shout out to Cikgu Rita she helped me alot because i legit sucked in malay :) . anyways mid school but good memories !",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101842607597608671226/reviews
Niyanthri ANAND,1,"This school was truly a very horrible place. I experienced much racism that wasn‚Äôt handled as when I told the teachers they said ‚ÄúIf you are sad you will make other people sad too.‚Äù When I reported rumours about me stealing items which were not true the teacher said ‚ÄúWell did you actually steal stuff?‚Äù Instead of confronting the bully and fixing the situation. The teachers reported the wrong things for further investigation because why did a simple harmless chat get shut down but the numerous students who were facing discrimination from classmates had it put down as sensitivity. In my experience, the teachers are unsympathetic and are very biased. They let this perspective affect treatment students get and the true problems are dismissed of. Teachers let personal opinions and experiences affect what they teach their students when confronted with dilemma. The teachers also ruined my passion for creative writing due to constant critical comments that were in my perspective very nitpicky as students who wrote similarly were not criticised. I felt a lot of hatred in that school. Overall the conduct of the school is horrible and you shouldn‚Äôt send your children here if you care about their welfare.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105380361512329747115/reviews
Tan Ying Han Alyssa (Tkgs),5,As a graduate of class of 2024 I really love how HGS incorporated fun and games in learning for example the primary 2 students baked during math class to learn the tiling of weight. HGS is also a place where the teachers care a lot about our mental health and will not hesitate to lend a listening ear to whoever needs help.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117461072870586140210/reviews
