Peggy Chan,5,"My daughter was intimidated by Mr Eio’s fierce and stern look when she first joined his lessons. But underneath that facade is a great teacher..fair and very patient. He is strict, but he makes the lessons lively and fun. Most importantly, he explains concepts well and clearly, and he never fails to provide assistance to students who require further help and clarifications. Ask, and he will gladly help! My daughter only just joined the centre for Sec 1 math this year. Mr Eio took time to give her useful tips and guidance he already gave to the existing students who have been with him earlier! Mr Eio is a dedicated and excellent teacher who is really happy at having his students improve in their grades. We would highly recommend Mr Eio’s  math lessons!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101773219463587339717/reviews

Mini XD,5,"Mr Eio is the funniest and most caring math teacher i know. In addition to being exceptionally great at explaining concepts and linkages to his students, he has little stories here and there, teaching his students life lessons that can be applied into their academic journey. I've always felt welcomed at his tuition and he has helped me to effectively score A1s in BOTH my A and E Maths in the O levels.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115412612572292744000/reviews
Samantha Yung,5,"This place provides excellent education to students and is a great choice for parents whose children need help and improvement in their studies. Learning here is easy-going as the teachers are patient and will provide students with quick and easy solutions to problems. Since I go here to learn Mathematics, my teacher, Mr Eio, has taught my classmates and I solutions to help us with certain topics. He has taught us many methods to solve various different questions. Most students will be able to understand the methods since he goes through them in multiple lessons.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106983517213276048598/reviews
