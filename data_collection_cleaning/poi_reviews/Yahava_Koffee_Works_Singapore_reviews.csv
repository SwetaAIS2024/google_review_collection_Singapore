Lizhen property,5,"I recently visited this charming coffee café, and I couldn't be more impressed! The cozy ambiance makes it the perfect spot to unwind and enjoy a delicious treat. I ordered their breakfast set under promo price that came with a cup of reg coffee. The bread was fresh, with a crunchy crust and soft, airy interior. Paired with their coffee, it made for a delightful combination.

I also had the pleasure of trying their waffles and pancakes, and both were exceptional.

Whether you're a waffle lover, pancake fan, or just in the mood for a great cup of coffee, this place delivers on all fronts. Highly recommend!

Pricing wise is also very reasonable for a cafe.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103071463649150760243/reviews
HC L,3,"It was a pleasant surprise to find such a cafe in the middle of an industrial park. They’re obviously pros in the coffee business, what with the heavy machineries in the background. However, I ordered the pancakes and they were nothing to shout about.   With the Japanese version of fluffy pancakes around Singapore, theirs were a tad dry and not fluffy. Butter and syrup were a little sparse (but I did order the plain version). Long black was the slightly sourish type, not the strong and bold type. Hope they’ll improve on the pancakes. Perhaps I’ll try their sandwiches or waffles next time. Loved the ambience with plenty of seats available.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
achoo,5,"Nice cafe in a very unusual location ( industrial park). Took us a while to locate and was surprised that it is crowded in a Sunday afternoon. The staff is helpful to help us find a seat and no one seem to be leaving.
We order a XL iced latte, a lime tart and butter croissant. The coffee is definitely worth making a visit there. I would also recommend the butter croissant.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106819122991102774021/reviews
Leslie Tay,3,"Coffee was average. Although the colour of the pancakes were great, they were a bit dense. I ordered 3 pancakes but they gave a tiny portion of butter and maple syrup. Additional syrup was charged at 50 cents. Suggest for the restaurant to provide more FOC otherwise the pancakes feel really jelat after the second piece.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114082592966802020943/reviews
Weimin Ong,4,"Exceptional coffee at a reasonable price. Tried the caffe latte, matcha latte, pancakes and tuna melt. The tuna melt was very good - crisp, hot, perfectly toasted, tuna was delicious.

Matcha latte was velvety smooth too, though a bit too milky for my liking (husband loved it). The pancakes were decent, fragrant and tasty, but were a bit too dry and tough. Not overly pricey, we had each at $3 opting for the Elite pancake choice of 3 pieces.

Overall it was a nice breakfast that we really enjoyed. Location can be a bit troublesome in the industrial area but definitely worth a revisit!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106180724988450175797/reviews
