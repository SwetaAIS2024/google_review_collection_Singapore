Karen Jubb (Love Life),3,"One of the promo 'buy 2 packets for $3' was short of 1 packet, I asked for assistance. The cashier right Infront of the self check out heard me and was pointing to the entrance when a supposed manager (heard her shouting instructions in another section earlier), a female with specs in Chinese accent walked over and asked me to take another brand, i told her my preference and she just said '没有‘ no more' and walked away. Meanwhile, the cashier brought the packet to me. 5 stars for the cashier whose name is DOLLY,  a little help goes a long way.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101231876323641589517/reviews
Rahim Aris,2,"One of the messiest, unorganized supermarket I have ever been to. You can’t find stuffs you would typically see in other supermarket here so you would need to find go to nearby marts to get them.

You will find multiple columns of the same item. You wonder if things were more organised, they can probably have more variety.

Better still, give it to a proper company like Fairprice or Sheng Siong.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111379773532651700705/reviews

Tiffany Chua,3,"Most employees are very nice and patient, however, there is one employee who is very rude. She has charged for the wrong amount atleast 4 times. People make mistakes, but she's not honest about it! Always thinking I'm in the wrong. I will update if I find out her name.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101675247447143314381/reviews
