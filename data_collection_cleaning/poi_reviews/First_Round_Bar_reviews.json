      "text": "Really fun, quaint, cozy little karaoke bar!\n\nFirst visited this establishment at the tail end of 2023, and have been going back since.\n\nDo note my review will probably be biased because Iâ€™m a karaoke addict.\n\nOutlet is quite easy to find as itâ€™s right in front of the escalator on level 2.\n\nCompared to the other places, itâ€™s quite small so best to drop the owner Jamie a message to gauge the availabilities of the place.\n\nVariety of drinks are adequate but Iâ€™m not a fussy drinker.\n\nThe vibes though is great when it starts to be at 70% capacity. Lively, loud, and legendary!\n\nSpace is a constraint though as there is an odd pillar right at the back of the bar, although there are tables there too.\n\nAlso the aircon gets turned off at 10pm due to centralised control. Jamie has mobile aircon and fan units scattered across the bar though. Surprisingly it doesnâ€™t get hot, humid, or stuffy, unless itâ€™s that kind of night with dance music and a mad crowd.\n\nOverall, really enjoy coming here and if you ever go, bring me along. Iâ€™ll be your chief entertainment officer for the night ðŸ¥³",

Drinks always worth it for town area pricing and always have good promos. Owners are so friendly and nice and fun to drink with even if you go alone!!",
