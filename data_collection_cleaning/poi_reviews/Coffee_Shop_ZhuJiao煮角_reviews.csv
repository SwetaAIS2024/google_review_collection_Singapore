Edward Wong,4,"Paid $4.30 for a plate of roasted duck rice. The duck meat was moist, tender and tasty. The soup was tasty too. Service was friendly and efficient. Very limited seats in the eatery during peak hours. Previously, I had tried the prawn dumpling noodle and this was not recommended.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173188680901424865/reviews

Terence Lee,1,"The economic rice stall can skipped. Rice is abit under cooked.
I am dinning in not packet out. (At around 1315pm) The vegetables and meat slices i ordered are cold.
Curry sauce very salty.
Basically, only the curry sauce is warm.
Seriously, not worth.
Who will want to pay to eat cold food? And this is not the 1st time already.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113175319567959304019/reviews
