Particularly Kumar is always so cheerful and makes us feel so welcomed.\n\nThe food is consistently good, nothing fancy but tastes good at decent prices. I particularly like the nasi goreng.\n\nIt’s a spacious place that is good for big groups.",

      "text": "This buffet reminds me of a food graveyard where chefs who drop out of culinary school end up at.\n\nThe choices were a mish mash of ‘let’s see what’s in the fridge’ and the presentation obviously needed plenty of help. The taste of every dish felt like as if the Chef has lost all his passion for cooking and wanted a career change to become a dancer..\n\nFor $28 per pax, I shouldn’t expect too much.. I’m a huge eater, but I couldn’t even bear to swallow another spoonful after my first full plate. The choices were severely lacking as well. Instead, I felt regretful that I didn’t go for the a la carte selection.\n\nI’ll give one star for the servers who seemed really nice, a stark opposite from the food on display..",
