      "text": "Utterly shock and disgusted with this outlet, came around 1120pm, wasn't full house, the \"kids party\" place was still quite empty however was utmost disgusted by the environment and hygienic issues this outlet is having.\n\nNo words to explain, do see from the photos itself, to be frank we were very hungry already and at this hour we just wanted to eat and go home which is why we continued to eat over here, however I felt sick after eating with the amount of thrash and toilet condition.\n\nJust look at the photos will be enough to explain and be disgusted, first time in my life I came across a restaurant that's so dirty, there were even flies hovering around the thrash and even flies around us.\n\nEven more disgusted when you enter the guys toilet(short hairs all around the sink)\n\nLastly, I walk pass and could peep into the kitchen area, the floors also have thrash over and many cups place all over. I do not know why no staff bothers to clear the the thrash, many ordered table service just like us and the staff can literally just walk pass all the thrash.\n\nHope the management can investigate this issue, time and date are shown in the receipt. (Serious unhygiene issue which can potentially lead to food poisoning)",

Have always adore your mcspicy, but what i got after paying 16 dollars for delivery, is a chicken with little of your so called \"juicy and tender\" meat and loads of fried flour. I didnt know you launched a \"new\" recipe for your mcspicy. Way to start the new year. Pull the burger apart and it was all flour and little shreds of meat. Toss it right out as i was full from anger.",
