Better care for the migrant workers‚Äîno shouting at patients. Do you think you know all the languages in the country?",

Feels like a joke.\n\nAt this day and age, no IT Tools to register walk in like QR code registration.\n\nSome of the patients here are just here to do simple screening.\n\nWhich can be automated without having to register manually.\n\nWith only 1 staff and long queue outside clinic.\n\nStaff seems to be taking own sweet time to do other things. No sense of urgency.\n\nRidiculous clinic! Inefficiency to the max! Hope it shuts down.",

      "text": "Went to see doctor when i injured my foot. No X-ray advised. I still feel painful after 2 weeks so I went back to ask for an xray. Next day to get the report and the doctor wrote me a referral letter to hospital. I asked for an X-ray image they said they can‚Äôt provide. I asked them do you expect me to do another X-ray in the hospital within 2 days ? They finally said they can provide it with a charge. From the 1st and  2nd consultation and the review of the X-ray plus the referral letter and get an image for my X-ray copy, they kept charging me every time. First consultation why didn‚Äôt ask me for an X-ray ? 2nd consultation charged me consultation fee without any consultation. I told the doctor I need an X-ray and he said yes, you need an X-ray. I stayed in the doctor room about 1minute. 3rd time to review my X-ray, charge me again. Write a referral letter charge again.  Ask me to go hospital immediately but didn‚Äôt give me the X-ray image. Ask for an image, charge again !!",
