Changed for a lesser value soup (water cress) and refused the refund. Still rancid.\n\nThrew it away after eating 2pcs of pork. Ate just plain pumpkin rice which was ok.\n\nService is good. Not complaining abt staff. But check your soup. The rancid pork smell is too strong. Eaten at other outlets before not like this.",
