They have high chairs available for children as well. Food is of good quality and quantity. Biryani is unbeatable any day. Bhojanam is served with pickle podi and ghee and thatâ€™s best.",

The Manchow Veg Soup was terrible, with a bad smell and no flavor.When I asked the staff ,they didn't bother to do anything about it.The Chicken Lollipop was also a disaster, tasting more like ketchup than the promised Szechwan sauce and it wasn't cooked . To make matters worse, our food took a long time to arrive, which only added to our frustration. Overall, I was unimpressed with the poor service and bad food. ðŸ˜“",

Pls reconsider plating dishes for comfort dining pls. Secondly my 2yr son drank half a litter of water by just eating 5 spoons of that fried (Ajinomoto laden) rice.",
