      "text": "I had a tooth extracted at a Dental clinic@Jurong for $663. It was very expensive, and the service was very poor. I bled a lot after the procedure. the nurse forgot to give me medicine and gauze, when I got home, the bleeding wouldn’t stop, I texted Clinic and told me to plug the bleeding hole with a tissue papers.\n\nI have been in pain for several days and can't sleep. I urgently contacted A dental clinic @ Jurong to see a doctor on April 28th, but they arranged an appointment for me is 30th April, That means I will continue to be in pain for another two days....\nThis tooth extraction was a very bad experience at A Dental Clinic @Jurong East.",

      "text": "I went for a molar extraction and was  initially very worried about the procedure since i had phobia whenever I visited a  dentist. But Doc Ng Seow Choon who treated me, re-assured and calmed me down. The entire procedure went smoothly,  i was so relieved.  I am  impressed with the treatment and professionalism  shown by Doc Ng and his team. The fees was also reasonable as I used  to go for  dental treatment at one of the government hospitals.  Thank you for the good experience !",

      "text": "Very bad experience ever. They anyhow charge patient. My husband and I do the same scaling and polishing but in different date. They charge my husband S$87 and charge me S$109. When confronted them, they took at least 10mins to think an excuses. They can’t even explain and had to go into the room look for senior to think of good explanations. The more senior lady staff then come out show very unhappy face and even question me why need to cancel payment? Said different doctor different charges and say we cannot choose doctor that this is all depends on which doctor available despite we do a booking. Plus the more senior lady staff there give bad attitude and act as if they are the right ones and we are the wrong ones. They did refund the difference of price after confrontation. But with the attitude given, I will say no no. Not going  to come again. Scammers. PS: saw other comments, I m not the first one to encounter this.",
