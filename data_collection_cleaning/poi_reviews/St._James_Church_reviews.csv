chiranjeet narayan dev,5,"I recently had the pleasure of attending a wedding at St. James Church in Singapore, and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience. From the moment I arrived, I was struck by the church's stunning architecture and serene atmosphere.

Architecture and Ambiance:
St. James Church is a beautiful blend of traditional and contemporary design. Upon entering, the interior is impressive, with high ceilings, intricate woodwork, and beautiful stained glass windows that bathe the space. The overall ambiance is peaceful and reverent, making it an ideal setting for a wedding ceremony.

Wedding Ceremony:
The wedding ceremony itself was beautifully conducted. The church staff were incredibly accommodating and ensured everything went smoothly. The altar area was tastefully decorated, enhancing the romantic atmosphere without being overwhelming. The acoustics in the church are excellent, allowing the couple's vows and the readings to resonate throughout the space.

Community Feel:
What stood out to me was the warm sense of community. The congregation was friendly and welcoming, making guests feel at home. It was clear that St. James Church is not just a place of worship but also a hub for social gatherings and support.

Facilities:
The church is well-maintained with clean facilities. There are ample seating arrangements for guests, and the layout allows for good visibility from all angles. I also appreciated the availability of restrooms nearby, which is always a plus during events.

Accessibility:
St. James Church is conveniently located and easily accessible by public transport. There are also parking facilities nearby for those driving. The church has made efforts to ensure that it is accessible to everyone, which is commendable.

Overall, my experience at St. James Church for this wedding was delightful. The combination of stunning architecture, a warm community atmosphere, and excellent facilities made it a perfect venue for such a special occasion. I would highly recommend St. James Church to anyone looking for a beautiful place to host their wedding or attend a service.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110590788353072024046/reviews

J,1,If you’re parking here cos your child goes to the preschool or if you’re a church goer pls beware. You park wrongly once and you get yelled at by a bald building facilities manager. You provide feedback re this lack of manners and get condescending sarcastic remarks from the Head Corporate Services and EA to Vicar. Shocking.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114196559353966448645/reviews

Eric Yap,5,"Well renovated church. We do not belong to this church but were attending a function there. It was clean, bright and with great seats and AV.

I'm sure the weekly services are worth attending and hope to come back to explore one day.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106084374093994586629/reviews
