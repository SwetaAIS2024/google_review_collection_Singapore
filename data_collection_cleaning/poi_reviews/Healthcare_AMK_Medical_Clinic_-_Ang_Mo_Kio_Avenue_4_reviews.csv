YY Lo,5,"I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Ong for his exceptional care and sharp diagnostic skills. After visiting numerous doctors about persistent stomach problems, it was only Dr. Ong who correctly suspected that the issue might be related to my gallbladder. He referred me to a specialist and revealed a large stone in my gallbladder after an ultrasound. Thanks to his attentiveness and expertise, I was able to have it removed, and Iâ€™m now free from the pain that had been troubling me for so long. Iâ€™m truly grateful to Dr. Ong for making such a difference in my life!

Moreover, Amy, the receptionist is very patient. She will explain clearly the medication and answer my queries. Thanks!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101019392807264497274/reviews

The clinic was clean and comfortable, making me feel at ease despite being sick. The doctor was thorough, took the time to listen to my symptoms, and provided clear advice on how to recover quickly.

I highly recommend this clinic for anyone looking for caring, and effective treatment!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100281172793782847653/reviews
Faye P,5,"I stumbled upon this clinic a few years ago when I decided to do a random Google search one day. The 5-star reviews caught my attention, and I honestly regret not knowing this place existed sooner â€” I live just opposite! Growing up, I always went to Dr Huiâ€™s clinic next door (and trust me, donâ€™t go there lol). Anyway, I recently noticed the ratings dropped and read through some of the one-star reviews, which really saddened me because Iâ€™ve been coming here for years and can confidently say this clinic deserves way more love. Honestly, it deserves 10 stars if not more.

First off, Iâ€™ve seen a lot of doctors over the years, but DR ONG is absolutely IMMACULATE. I canâ€™t say much about the other doctors, but Dr Ong is hands down the best Iâ€™ve ever come across. Heâ€™s so knowledgeable, empathetic, and a brilliant listener. He cured my partnerâ€™s back drip issue and fungal infection in just 1-2 weeks â€” something that 4 other doctors at nearby clinics couldnâ€™t fix after a whole year. They were his companyâ€™s panel doctors, but they couldnâ€™t help at all. Thatâ€™s why my partner would rather pay out of pocket to see Dr Ong â€” because heâ€™s just THAT good. As for me, Iâ€™ve gone to Dr Ong for everything â€” from minor skin issues to more serious concerns. Just yesterday, I went in for a tiny red patch on my elbow. Most people might think itâ€™s not a big deal, but Dr Ong took the time to inspect every little patch, and he looked even more concerned than I was. After a thorough check, he explained it was likely a fungal infection. His attention to detail and care really stand out.

Now, about the complaints Iâ€™ve seenâ€¦ I donâ€™t get it. The queue moves so quickly, even when the clinic is packed. Iâ€™ve had to wait maybe 1 hour tops, even when there were more than 10 people ahead of me. To put it in perspective, Dr Huiâ€™s clinic next door takes over an hour to see maybe five patients, plus another 15-30 minutes to dispense meds. Yes, I grew up hearing my parents complain about how slow Dr Huiâ€™s clinic is LOL over here, once youâ€™re out of the doctorâ€™s room, Aunty Amy (the main receptionist) has your medication ready almost immediately. No long waits â€” itâ€™s fast and efficient.

Another thing I love â€” Dr Ong studied dermatology and helped me with my cystic acne years ago. Iâ€™ve struggled with acne my whole life, and Iâ€™ve seen at least four dermatologists before, but the acne always came back after I stopped the meds. With Dr Ong, I now have almost perfect skin, with just the occasional pimple here and there. He also offers super affordable chemical peels if thatâ€™s something you need. Honestly, is there anything this guy doesnâ€™t know???? Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s top 1% in his field ðŸ˜‚

The clinic also stays open until 10 PM, and Dr Ong will still see you at 9:55 PM, even when the clinic is busy. Iâ€™ve never seen him turn anyone away, and compared to other places (looking at you, Frontier clinic), the staff here is super friendly and accommodating.

Iâ€™ve never called ahead for appointments, but a lot of regulars, like myself, know you can grab a queue number earlier in the day for evening appointments. Itâ€™s pretty straightforward â€” just respect the process, or find another clinic if itâ€™s not for you.

This place is top-notch for real. Dr Ongâ€™s expertise, care, and dedication truly make this clinic stand out. And Aunty Amy always makes sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently. Highly recommend!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100380872304610129410/reviews
