Kendrick Wee,3,Food was average. Nothing to shout about. Price wise slightly more expensive. Need to pay for water. Still for $1 and sparkling for $2. Lotsa empty field for kids to run and play. Bouncy castle should be fun for the kids.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793547912532718349/reviews
Brendon Koh,1,"Food is below average. Service is question mark.

Came here for the first time. Booked table for 10 people, didn't specify outdoor or indoor. The Indian manager told us to sit outdoors. After awhile it started pouring heavily. We had to shift the table inwards as our friends legs were getting drenched by the water at the back.

Everything is self-service and they still dare to charge service charge. When asked for water, the waiter told us to go to counter and walked off. When we went to the counter, was told that water is chargeable. We ordered 3 bottles of water but they only served the water after 10 minutes.

F&B is an expensive industry but this wouldn't be the way you treat your guests if you were the owner of this restaurant and invited your own family.

The whole experience felt bad, cold and unwelcoming and I will not come back again even if the food is good. I would not recommend coming here unless you are looking for a kid-friendly place (sometimes they set up bouncy castle, soccer etc) and don't mind bad/non-existent service.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101279540381657868918/reviews
mako ng,2,"Carpark A closed got to park at carpark B , longer walking distance to the cafe. Managed to get indoor dining. 32 minutes waiting for food at non peak hours.

Comfort food grade, don’t expect a lot.

10% service charge to Self Service for utensils (fork, knives, spoons, paper napkins etc.), chili and sugar at the far end of the cafe.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100985929058336776939/reviews
Lee Wayne,4,"It’s a great place to bring your kids and dogs here to relax and have a meal. There’s bouncy castle for kids to play and a large outdoor field where kids and dogs can run around. Outdoor area is dog friendly here at Cafe Melba. Very ideal for family with kids or fur kids :)

Overall the food is not bad and thumbs up on the chicken Pamigiana! Really tasty. Their fries are not bad too. We will surely return again for our friends gathering.

Service is acceptable and the food was served pretty fast during a busy Sunday lunch.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100765138613488056874/reviews
Jonathan CM POH,5,"Probably the best grilled chicken sandwich I have EVER had! Tender, juicy and full of flavours!

This place is dog friendly too but be warned… the portions are huge!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109329336059697710489/reviews
