Just a little surprised to see the noodles was not properly separated. It was fully cooked though. Do opt out the chilli if cannot take too spicy food. It was pretty spicy for me.\n\nI do agree that the cashier was a little rude.. well properly is her way of talking. She is just a loud person.",

Food and drinks have never been disappointing. Service is below par.\n\nRecommended for meals if you are around this area but have to bear with poor service. No wonder the overall rating is quite poor.",

I can give you another cup but no ICE!” He then proceeded to pour half the ice in the cup into another cup. I was shocked. I then asked if I could pay for more ice since the bottle of water is not cold and left on the counter? “$0.50!” He shot back!\n\nSo service? What service! I think this guy needs major up training on basic service let alone good customer service.\n\nAtmosphere sucks as the tables are not clean and there are only two fans near the service counter but they don’t reach all the tables.",
