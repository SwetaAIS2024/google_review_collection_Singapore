Exquistely crafted local flavours so brilliantly combined and created into new things with new textures. I am in awe. So of course i had to bring my young nephews to try. Definitely a place to enjoy from young to old.",

      "text": "A charming café that blends Western style with local flavors, offering a unique breakfast experience. The rose cheesecake was rich and delicately floral, while the sourdough with curry dip delivered a bold, comforting taste of familiar spices. The latte, made from Singaporean kopi, was smooth, robust, and aromatic. While the curry is pre-portioned from a central kitchen, extra sauce is available for an additional fee. The cozy ambiance adds to the charm, though weekends can get lively with families and kids around. Still, it’s a lovely spot to enjoy a thoughtful fusion of flavors.",
