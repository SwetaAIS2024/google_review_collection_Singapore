Patricia Yeo,4,"Walked-in for a large group of 10, but they have ample seating for large and small groups after the renovation.

They still have physical menu, but ordering and bill payment has been digitalized which makes it very convenient and less waiting time in between.

Food quality is consistent across the branches and all time favorite is the Dan Gui Roast Duck.

Value for money sets for family gatherings.

Service staffs are attentive and polite.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106155978583921992243/reviews

L Wong,4,"Roasted duck with angelica herb was great! Personally felt that Iberico char siew was too fat, it was like biting into chuck of fats. I do not enjoy it.
I will go for the duck!!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105052490586738746635/reviews
Quing_ÂàòÂ¶àÂ¶à,5,"Dian Xiao Er‚Äôs roasted duck is a culinary masterpiece! Each bite is a perfect harmony of crispy skin and succulent meat, bursting with rich flavors. It‚Äôs like a flavor journey that keeps you coming back for more. If you haven‚Äôt tried it yet, you‚Äôre missing out on a true gem in the world of Chinese cuisine!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113415962335886718172/reviews
V C,3,"First year that we decided to have our family dinner outside on New Years Eve. It‚Äôs a 10 courses meal and more than what we can finish. Good food overall but definitely not worth SGD490. A few of the dishes were just very ordinary dishes where you can find at most Chinese restaurants. The restaurant is located inside of the shopping mall. Maybe it was full of customers that day, the whole place was too warm and that made it less enjoyable for us.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101378851650068149163/reviews
