Chanel Lim,1,"Extremely rude service — would not recommend

I had a very unpleasant experience at this duck rice stall. I placed my order politely — duck rice with duck thigh and roasted pork. However the man serving me completely ignored what I said and instead raised his voice, rudely shouting, “What do you want?” I calmly repeated my order, and again he snapped, “We have duck, rice and noodles. What do you want?”

His aggressive attitude was completely uncalled for. I was simply trying to buy a meal and support his business, which seemed quiet at the time. When I asked if I could use my CDC vouchers to pay, he barked back, “TAKE IT OUT LAH,” in an even more hostile tone.

To the owner reading this — if you're wondering why business seems slow, this might be a big reason. Good food is important, but basic respect towards customers is even more crucial. No one wants to support a place where they feel mistreated.

If you genuinely care about your business, I urge you to take this issue seriously. The man pictured in the photo I’ve attached is the one who served me.

Judging by other reviews, this isn’t an isolated incident. Totally unacceptable — I won’t be returning.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107881392739496402476/reviews
Joanna,5,"Pleasantly surprised to find this stall with above average roasted food. Been eating it a few times since we chanced upon it. Was a bit sad that the roast pork was sold out on Christmas Eve.

Roast Pork and Char Siew are goodddd...",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110837645986894984637/reviews
Tiến Tạ,1,"I came here to order takeout. At first, he asked me if I wanted to eat here or takeout. I told him I wanted to takeout. Then he talked to his friend and forgot. Then I told him I wanted to takeout. He got angry and yelled at me. Why didn't I say it? I said I did. Then he packed it and threw the bag in front of me. I think he should learn how to communicate again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102831805138779956868/reviews
Savan,3,"In terms of coffee shop standards, this roast meat shop is considered decent. There’s no unpleasant pork smell inside, the portions are sufficient, the prices are reasonable, and there’s air conditioning",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115757903290306503916/reviews
Delvyn Mah,5,"One of the best HK roasted delights u can find in Singapore. The proportion of fat and meat is perfect. Taste is the best for their char siew and roasted pork is crispy AF.

The herbal roasted duck is so good that you cannot find it elsewhere.

Prices are very reasonable and value for money. Never once disappoint. Eating it regularly at least once a week.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115254559608145017381/reviews
