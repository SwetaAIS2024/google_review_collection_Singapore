Jerry Chan,5,"Open late until 3am daily, a whisky and cocktail bar with a speakeasy concept because behind the curtains are actually very large and luxurious karaoke rooms!  Songs very new and crowd quite mixed between locals and expats. First karaoke i went to in my life with a full cocktail list and also dedicated bartender.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110369960258543541348/reviews
Yenny Tanh,5,"An uber luxury karaoke cocktail bar in Robertson Walk! Husband organised my surprise birthday here after dinner at Robertson Quay. My friends and I love to sing karaoke but none of us had ever been to a place like this.
Smells really nice, no smell of stale smoke. Service is super friendly and attentive -the manager even sang my favourite duets with me (thanks KJ!)
Rooms feel like someone's living room - comfy sofas, soft lights and mini bar, aromatherapy diffusers etc. and even have Ashley and Co soap in their (very clean) toilets. They also use high end home theatre grade amplifiers, crazy!
Drink selection is wide a really high quality range at pretty decent prices. Total probably 30 wines, 15 sakes, 10 champagnes and dozens of single malt whiskey or so.
Definitely going back soon, I know a lot of my friends will absolutely love this place. Place was packed when we were there, hope the owners open another before it becomes impossible to book a room there.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113593926524013042438/reviews

Mario Chan,5,"My new favourite place for karaoke. Finally found a karaoke I can go to because I actually enjoy the surroundings instead of just tolerating the place because friends want to sing. Whereas private club karaokes can be nice but songs aren't updated and service is slow, and commercial karaokes have new songs but service is bad and drinks are rip off, this place is best of both worlds. Attentive service and also very updated songs, English and Chinese.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118137310680822881424/reviews
Glen Francis,5,"Wonderful place for karaoke. The rooms nicely designed, the seats are comfortable. Great selection of songs. The sound system is not bad. The mics are relatively clear. They have a nice selection of wines, whiskeys and cocktails. Best you could order food in. We order via Grab, Ginza Japanese food. Overall we had a great time here. Thumbs up",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106709479245323997426/reviews
