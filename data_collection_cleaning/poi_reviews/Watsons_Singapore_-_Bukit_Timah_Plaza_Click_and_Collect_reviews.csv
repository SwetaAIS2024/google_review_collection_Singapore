Evelyn Huang,5,"I was at Bt Timah Plaza on Tuesday 8 April and was served by a lady named Vivienne .
I approached her for assistance to book online as I cldnt find the items I wanted .  Vivienne has nicely assisted to pick up the items I wanted.  Told her that I will pay for delivery to hv these items sent to my home  as they were too heavy for me to carry home being an elderly person . To my surprised vivienne offered to send these items without any charge on her way home.  I was certainly taken aback for her kindness and willingness to help which is beyond her call of duties .
I sincerely appreciate her help but felt bad on my part for imposing on her .
To this - she certainly deserved to be complimented and applauded by her services rendered .  Thank you so so much Vienne . Your kindness will always be remembered.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111225850162477897486/reviews
