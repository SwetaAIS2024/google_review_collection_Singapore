Shark Sharkey,4,"This is one of the rare pools in Singapore to have a 4m depth section. Great for diving and breath hold / apnea training.

Also very clean as not many people use it and those who use are more conscious of cleanliness.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109525289527506715896/reviews
Leia,4,"Nice 50m pool with affordable pricing. Pool is clean and water is refreshing. It's much deeper (I think it's for diving) at one end so if you're worried, just swim near the lane ropes. There are lifeguards on duty too.

It's just a little far in, so you'll have to walk some distance from the bus stop.

Friendly counter (check-in?) staff too.

I'll visit again for a swim :-)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107339312369387349595/reviews
