Jen A,5,"Ashwini is so talented! I went for a painting class with her, and she was so warm and friendly she showed me her exquisite paintings! They are all beautiful i was thrilled to see such amazing art! On our 1-on-1 class she thought me a lot of painting technics. She made sure i was comfortable and enjoying it. I would love to have another painting class with her and probably will have my son have too in the near future!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106125175080386463634/reviews
