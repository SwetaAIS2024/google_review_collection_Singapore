N Y,3,"Taste of Lor mee was decent, but fish was fishy, and overall was quite pricey. And given it was supposed to be famous, there was a certain level of expectation that wasn’t met, this tasted normal.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105633440650460007544/reviews
HT,1,"Saw many bad comments, ordered anyway. Indeed using phone and I was ignored for about 1 minute. Lor Mee in general is quite good actually, but u can’t get the garlic, chilli, or other condiments yourself other than vinegar.

Was ready to give it a better rating but comparing to the other Lor Mee or any other stalls among the sea of coffee shops nearby, this $6 lormee is really overpriced for what it offered. I was expecting way more ingredients but I can barely find any pork or fish, just 1-2 little bits of it..

Comparing the photos shown, I had to lower the rating further. Even the egg was half an egg instead of a full egg shown in the photos, not the right way to cut cost. Photos of Michelin star and all the ads, no where near and not the right way to do business. I seldom give such bad reviews, but just compare what I received and the signature photo shown.

Don’t depend on past glory to do business.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116385489983414228727/reviews
Alan Morghan,5,Super nice. Similar taste to the main old airport branch. Even packet back they separate the sauce. Heat it up and taste as great! Fried fish one was yummy at $5. Will return and eat again!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113064976442753868420/reviews
Gator,4,"A new coffee shop opened within the vicinity of my home. This is one of the stall located inside the coffee shop. Tried all the offerings with the help of my family members, everyone ordering something.

Pretty standard lor mee and they have a number of options like cod fish nuggets. At least now we will have an additional option for food now that the new shop is opened. Hoping that they will maintain the standard.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
caryln loh,1,"Bad service from the clementi west branch. We ordered without chilli. And the waiter asked if we want all other condiments and we said yes. And he added chilli.
He refused to change order. So we returned him the bowl. It was $6 a bowl.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113878378618713641749/reviews
