Room was spacious, bed and pillows super comfortable. Will definitely stay again. Enjoyed the golf course views from my window.\nClose to Changi airport is a bonus.",

Room Keys were not programmed correctly so got stuck on floor one no help from staff.  Just kept telling me to go to floor 2 to get it reprogrammed but was not able as key did not work??? Eventually found a cleaner who helped me get to reception. My advice hotel looks nice but don't book it most unhelpful place in Singapore.",

Love the ambience.\nWe went swimming late evening/night, the Lifeguard on duty was very hardworking and diligent, doing his rounds and using a torchlight to check on the surroundings of the pool. Chatted with him for a bit. :)\n\nOne thing to improve on, the fish spa. Even though it was free to use, I didn't dare to use it as it looked poorly maintained and wasn't inviting.",

Requested for higher floor but give lower floor, bit disappointment. The room is nice with full equip of towel, shampoo and toiletries. Pool is also great for kids. They enjoyed the most. For people who want quiet and rest..this is a good place.",
