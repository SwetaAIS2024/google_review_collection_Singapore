HealthcAIre Kim,5,"Hawkerman, Haig Road: Elevated hawker fare at incredible prices of $5. It‚Äôs amazing they‚Äôre not declaring this as fusion Singaporean rubbish and tooting it at a fancy shophouse and slapping on high prices. It‚Äôs our new favourite local joint at Malay quarters of Haig Road / Joo Chiat. #eatstylishtravelstylish",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101154220359165719571/reviews
Rae Things,5,"I‚Äôve eaten this for breakfast and dinner, my most fave stall in the area! But i have a critic for Mee goreng jawa. The dish that this stall makes is more leaning to tangy-like pad-thai flavor rather than how mee goreng jawa is supposed to taste like (sweet and savory, no tangyness) (im from indo and javanese so i know how it shouldve tasted like). I think the char kwe teow is already the perfect flavor for mee goreng jawa so the chef could make 2 dish with the same sauces. If u still want to keep the flavor then theres a similar indonesian mee brand called ‚ÄúMie gacoan.‚Äù",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106618025263958574157/reviews
Besharps,5,"Was in the area and gave this stall a try for the first time and I went with the dry mee siam ($5). The service was good, I received my meal fast üëç The food tasted delicious, the combination of the noodles, egg, prawn and anchovies created a scrumptious meal. There was also a good portion spread across the plate, making it quite worth the relatively low price. üëç",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111020676081888304196/reviews
Chew Chee Chin,5,"Dishes Tried:
Chye Pok Kway Teow
- Wok hei is evident. The Chye Pok (preserved radish) flavor stands out, and the crispy chicken skin garnish adds a delightful crunch.
‚Ä¢
Dry Laksa
- Decent dish with a good balance of laksa spices and curry leaf aroma.
‚Ä¢
Dry Mee Siam
- Sweeter than expected; could use a touch more sourness. I liked its slightly wet texture.
‚Ä¢
Assam Laksa
- The Assam flavor isn‚Äôt very strong or thick compared to Penang-style laksa.
‚Ä¢
Mee Jawa Goreng
- Enjoyable but would be better with more eggs.
‚Ä¢
Oyster Omelette
- Average. Doesn‚Äôt quite match up to traditional hawker-style oyster omelettes.
‚Ä¢
All these dishes are incredibly affordable, priced at just $5 each!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110673035627675792942/reviews
