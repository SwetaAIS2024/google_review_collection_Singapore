We hike and jog along the yellow path and it took us around an 1h 15 mins to complete the whole trail. Overall, it’s a perfect place to relax your mind and yap with your friends. Would definitely recommend coming here with your friends and loved ones!",

It is well signposted throughout and the boardwalk section was especially memorable. It was incredibly easy to reach via public transport - I’m glad I included this in my Singapore itinerary to mix it up from just tourist locations!",

It’s a fantastic spot for a leisurely stroll or simply to relax and enjoy nature. We saw plenty of monkeys along the way and were lucky enough to spot a Malayan Flying Lemur clinging to a tree! Highly recommended for nature lovers and anyone looking for a peaceful escape.",
