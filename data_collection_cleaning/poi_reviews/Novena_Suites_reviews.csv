Flo Yeow,5,"Super conveniently located right by Novena Square and Velocity, and is literally 100 steps from the train station. Certain units can be a little small, but if you're okay with the size, it's actually a very very comfortable space for 2-3 pax.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Yuki Ri,5,"My 1st visit to this place today 30/07/24. I would like to thank Mr Muhammad Bin Mohd Habit from Interlock Security. Thank you for his kind assistance rendered.

Maggie Green,3,"Sercurity is not being security. Leaving the guard house empty and leaving the gate open.  Otherwise, it is a nice place to live. Nice pool and condos. Not a very social place, but when you see people they are usually nice and helpful.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113967529831551301834/reviews
CELAB 99,3,"It's a condo building.  It's about 20 yrs old I think,  decent pool but it's right next to Street.  Units in back of building have a lot of noise in daytime from neighbors tennis courts and at night from the loading garages of the velocity and novena square shopping mall.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117948022245094768490/reviews
