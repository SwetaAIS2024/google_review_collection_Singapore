KH Chong,5,"Probably the best Mee Sua in Singapore. Very smooth Mee Sua, rich and tasty soup with a pinch of rice wine. Very generous with ingredients including thick slices of liver, handmade pork ball, mushroom and egg. Asked for other type of vegetables but they said won’t match the Mee Sua taste, gave me more spring onion instead. Seems like they are really serious about their food. $4 for a large bowl, really worth it. Usually long queue, try visiting during weekday afternoon when there is less crowd.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108028225713545630861/reviews
Panna Metta,4,"Big bowl of mee sua for $4, filling and flavourful. The amount of mee sua is almost double of what other stalls sell for mee sua. The amount of meat is less though. The soup is flavourful and does not feel thirsty afterwards.
If take away, stall will pack separately the soup and mee sua, so the mee sua will not turn soggy.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113331481375789850945/reviews
Shawn Yip,4,"This is a noodle dish where pork is the main ingredient. In the bowl, it has minced pork meat balls, normal meat balls, pig liver, pork slices, egg, decent mushroom slices.
It is served with these ingredients inside a big bowl of hot soup. The soup is delicious, and tasty. The smallest bowl that I have is of $4 but it is enough to fill up an average sized guy like me. During cooling weather, this dish tastes especially nice.

Besides mee sua (thin noodles), they serve 生面 which is thicker noodles.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113622169374854387749/reviews
Kenny Doritos,4,"Soup is great with alittle ginger-y flavor. Meat balls are alittle overcooked. Lean meat is alright: coated with starch and tastes alittle bland. Chili was impressive.

Will be fantastic if they can improve the preparation of the meat.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100925133455196439262/reviews
derek neo,5,"Nice big bowl of mee sua for $4, value for money.  Generous portion of ingredients, pork ball, meat pork ball, pork liver and a little rice wine.  I prefer strong taste of rice wine, will ask for more next time.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113015523826545524096/reviews
