Ashley Tan,5,"5 Stars for them. Tutor has a way to keep my child very engage throughout the entire session . My child grown interest to continue after the trial lesson online. After 2nd lesson, my child started to converse with us in Mandarin as much as she can , which is a very positive progress in her learning. Ms Zhang is very engaging and she will always update every student progress after each lesson which is very useful for us parents to understand the learning progress. Improvement proven too.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101458617797901907468/reviews
Clarice,5,"We had an incredible experience with Teacher Nili & Teacher Zhang.

Teacher Zhang is my daughter’s primary teacher for this year. The lessons are well-structured, and the teaching approach is both engaging and effective. Teacher Zhang is very understanding, patient and most important she is able to get my daughter to no longer shy away and fear of the Chinese language.

We noticed a progress in my daughter’s listening, reading, and writing abilities. Her grades have also improved.

The learning environment is always encouraging, and the teacher’s passion for teaching is evident. We highly recommend this tuition to any kids looking to learn or improve their Chinese.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112084604882675445054/reviews
Goo Kwok,5,"I had one of the teachers as a home tutor and am proud that she has since opened her own tuition centre. My 2nd child is now attending classes at Nili and as she somewhat finds it more challenging to learn the language compared to the other children, the teachers explore different methods to engage her in learning and spark interest in the language.

It’s evident that the 1 star review here is fake as I never fail to get a response from the teachers after lesson hours. The teachers are also often around after classes to update the parents on the children’s progress and lessons for the day.

Happy to say that my child is improving steadily, if slowly but surely, so please keep up the good work!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108459224208733814936/reviews
raven yeo,5,"Both my kids find the Chinese lessons engaging and have developed a greater appreciation for the language. Their grades have also improved.

The teachers are responsive and keep parents informed about progress and any schedule changes, which is very reassuring. Additionally, the small class sizes ensure that each student receives individual attention from the teacher.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106194651497055292170/reviews
Gaylin Tan,5,Teacher Zhang and Teacher Nili are dedicated. Class groups are kept small for more focused teaching. My son's interest and attitude for Chinese has increased since I enrolled him. He became more motivated to do his Chinese homework and his Chinese has improved because of it. Highly recommend Nili Chinese Learning!,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114161361970912772833/reviews
