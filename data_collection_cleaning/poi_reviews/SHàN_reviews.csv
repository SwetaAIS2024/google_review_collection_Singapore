Chan Lai Kuan,4,"Nestled amidst lush greenery, the restaurant boasts a charming colonial-style building, creating a unique and special ambiance. The service was impeccable, with friendly and attentive staff. The food presentation was visually appealing. We ordered the CNY set menu, and all the dishes were enjoyable. Personally, I preferred the white pepper lobster to the black pepper version. The white pepper offered a subtle, nuanced flavor that wasn't overpowering, although I would have preferred some white rice to accompany it as the lobster itself was slightly salty on its own",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110227785102602044189/reviews
Chewielicious T,5,"Don’t wait—visit soon while it’s still a hidden gem!

I recently visited this newly opened restaurant (just two months old!) for Saturday lunch and tried Set A at $88. Let me tell you—it was worth every penny. By the end of the meal, I was so full I had to unfasten my belt, thanks to the generous and absolutely delicious portions. I’ve paid double elsewhere for far less satisfying meals, so this was a delightful surprise.

What makes this place special? Their chef, hailing from Tianjin, has worked in a Michelin-starred restaurant before, and it truly shows in the quality and creativity of the dishes.

Highlights of the meal:

•	Iberico Pork: So tender it literally melts in your mouth.
•	Paofan: Warm, comforting, and packed with flavor—pure perfection.
•	“Orh Nee” with a Twist: Their innovative take uses sweet potato instead of yam, offering a modern yet nostalgic dessert experience.

The overall dining experience feels luxurious, with stunning tableware and a tranquil setting nestled among lush greenery. It’s a hidden oasis that’s easy to reach if you’re driving.

Even better, the tea is reasonably priced—a whole pot for just $6 (finally, a restaurant that doesn’t overcharge for tea!).

Special shoutout to our server, Ray. His attentiveness and knowledge of the food elevated our experience. You can tell he’s a foodie himself!

They also have a Chinese New Year menu coming up, so it’s the perfect time to check this place out. With their fresh start and Michelin-starred expertise, I have no doubt this restaurant will quickly become a favorite for anyone seeking incredible food at a fantastic value.

P/S: Please give me a thumbs up if you like my recommendation, I’m curious to know if you guys feel the same!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112973732117339181795/reviews
