Sheren Regina,5,"Went on a weekday morning so it wasnt that crowded.
Tried the grassjelly dessert with normal sugar, was too sweet, would try with half sugar next time.
You tiao, definitely would reorder.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113908769832604196182/reviews
Stella Kee,1,"The staff working are so so slow! Beancurd is in broken pieces. Like how even... Plastic bag to soya bean drink very bad quality, it literally snapped. It has been a while since I've gotten Selegie, but it's very disappointing. I think I will stick to the competitor brand.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112882198084160624930/reviews
Henry Cheng,4,"They serve really nice soya bean milk and soya bean pudding. You can literally taste the freshness of the brew. The drinks are not overly sweetened as well, just nice.

I always see many people in the store every time I pass by. Iâ€™m glad I decided to pop in to try it out today.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151994390288524704/reviews
Min HL,5,"Woah they have added new tables outdoor for customers to enjoy the desserts in the shop!

Always in love with their soya beancurd - super soft! If you get it hot, even if you put in fridge for few days, it is still very soft and delicious.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103965869018673563240/reviews
F L,4,"Simple food, but satisfying flavor!

The muffins are great; with so many flavors to choose from - oats, banana, lemon, strawberry and blueberry.

The rice ball beancurd and grass jelly with tapioca cubes are really good and satisfying.

Worth the money.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118412867496723033084/reviews
