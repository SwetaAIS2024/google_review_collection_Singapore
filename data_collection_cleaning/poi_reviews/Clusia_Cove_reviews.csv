Justin Tan,2,"Come few times this year and the pump always not working. The water has lots of bubbles. Look very dirty. Even algae. Used to be crowded. Notices should be put on if the water quality is bad.
Hope NPark can do something about it.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102123199987620138876/reviews

Forest BK,5,"Clusia Cove is a children Water Playground mimicking the likes of costal shores. Family with young children would enjoy having fun time and bonding session at Clusia Cove.
Bring your young children here for some great time together. They will surely love it. Toilet and shower facilities are available. Bring your own towel.
Operate from 0800 -1900hrs, Closed on Mondays (except for Public Holidays) and Tuesdays if preceding Monday is a Public Holiday.
Fun note: Water at Clusia Cove is constantly cleansed through a closed circuit cleansing system, where water circulate through Cleansing Biotope out to the Water Playground, then flowing into Eco Pond and back to Cleansing Biotope, repeating and constantly cleansing the water (through a series of cleansing systems) at Water Playground ensuring the water is safe for play.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
R H,3,"So, we ventured to Clusia Cove at Jurong Lake Gardens, enticed by the idea of a free water playground. The concept is fantastic—tidal pools, sand play, and a naturalistic setting that mimics coastal shores.  The water is shallow and clean, thanks to an eco-friendly treatment system involving sand beds and UV purification.  ￼ ￼

But here’s the catch: shade is practically nonexistent. Despite being surrounded by trees, the water play area lacks adequate cover, making it feel like you’re wading in a sunlit skillet.  There’s a shaded area near the toilets, but it’s not sufficient for the entire playground. ￼

On the bright side, the bathroom and shower facilities are clean and well-maintained—standard for Singapore.  ￼

Final thoughts: Clusia Cove has great potential, but the lack of shade is a significant drawback. Consider visiting in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid the peak sun.  ￼",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113829359707103777733/reviews
Wyatt Biessel (WyattVSWorld),4,"Clusia cove is a great waterplay area however it’s gotten noticeably dirtier in the last year. The water and sand used to be clean, but now there is algae and strange bubble film floating on the surface.

The water flow doesn’t seem as strong either as it used to flow freely out the back. Now there is a lot of sand build up where it used to flow.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117392825369920886546/reviews
