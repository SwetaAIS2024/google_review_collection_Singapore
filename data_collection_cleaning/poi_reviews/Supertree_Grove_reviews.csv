Nanda Linn Aung,5,Amazing light and sound. I had the pleasure of enjoying massive classic sound integration and also many awesome movie themed integrated light and sound show. Some visitors will lay down and take the video upwards. Very good planning and design. After that most of the spectators went to Satay by the bay to enjoy delicious dinner. Absolutely radiant and full of spectrums with the presentation. Highly recommend.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100222661873355436413/reviews
Carleen Bongay,5,"This place is definitely a must-see! The best part? It’s free to explore, except for the walkway (but trust me, it’s worth it). Around 7:45 PM and 8:45 PM, they feature synchronized light displays set to music, transforming the entire area into a magical atmosphere. It's truly picturesque—like something straight out of a dream. One of the things I really loved was how spacious it was. There’s plenty of room to just chill, take a deep breath, and appreciate the beauty around you.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118043577808879045436/reviews
Marcos O. Diogo,5,"The biggest of all tree, I decided to go to the top and it wasn’t a mistake, this is one of the multiple activities garden by the bay offers you should read garden by the bay reviews to get a knowledge of the overall experience but since this is abstraction itself I’ll try to rate this experience alone.

Very affordable I’ve decided to go to the top, what an engineering wonder, amazing views and it really felt to be in the middle of the forest l.

I gotta applaud this government initiative to make artificial and natural at the same time greenery",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113809644458768259113/reviews
Lavi Shiffman,5,"Gardens by the Bay in Singapore is an amazing and beautiful park that shows how you can combine a city with gardens. There are amazing botanical gardens, well-kept plants and flowers, and neat paths that are fun to walk on. The highlight of the place is the suspension bridge, which gives an amazing view and is highly recommended to climb. Another place that is highly recommended to climb is the tall tree from where there is an amazing 360-degree view of southern Singapore. The gardens are maintained to a high standard and the landscaping there is impressive. After sunset, there is an amazing light show there, and it is highly recommended.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111153691460234113747/reviews
angelo zoras,5,Spent at least over half a day here . Seen it in pictures and it was better in real . A great idea and invention for creating a green space. Highly recommend.  We didn't realise they change colours to music but without it. It was still spectacular,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118256144796017682027/reviews
