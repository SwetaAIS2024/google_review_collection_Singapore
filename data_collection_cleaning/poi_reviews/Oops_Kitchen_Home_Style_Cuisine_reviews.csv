Ling Quek,5,"Fresh ingredients were used in all their dishes. All dishes were so delicious. Their boneless har cheong chicken wings are a MUST to order. Big, juicy and crispy! Char Kway Teow was perfect with a wok hei flavor too! Love their generous pork lard in their noodles dishes! Fresh and big oyster in their crispy orh luak omelette too! Definitely will be back!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115952618114666007189/reviews
Miyous L,4,"I had a fantastic experience ordering from Oops Kitchen! The Hokkien Mee arrived slightly wet—just the way I like it—with a rich, flavorful stock that made every bite delicious. The oyster omelette was a real standout: crispy at the edges and loaded with fresh, plump oysters, reminding me of the ones served at Alor Street in KL. Their Har Cheong Gai (prawn paste chicken) was fried to perfection—crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside, and best of all, completely boneless except for the wing tip. Absolutely satisfying. Will definitely be ordering again!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111631391565882372090/reviews
David Oon,5,"Tasty traditional Chinese food, great service and ambience!

Had a family dinner here and ordered the signatures. The hits - the boneless Har Cheong chicken wings! Delish! Crispy, tasty and tender on the inside, and not oily. That very same description can be applied on the crispy orh luak too. The tangy chilli goes so so well with it. Very well executed.

The laksa was traditional in taste, rich and aromatic! The last we had was the dry pig trotter with beehoon. This reminds me of the taste of days of old, when my gramps used to cook the dry version of beehoon with the canned Narcissus pork leg! Yummy, gooey, mess of lard mixed in with the noodles. Pair that with the sambal belachan... And it's delish! We ordered a tad too much, but food it was worth it! Generous portion too!

Great selection of drinks too!

Service is tops. The lady boss, is very welcoming, and friendly. She made time to check in with each patron. And apparently she has great photographic memory! Chill lighting and deco to create the right mood to chill and chat.

Will certainly be back to experience the vibe, food and service! Lots of others from the menu to try out.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111461636018977333111/reviews
