Joyce,5,"Having foster kids that come and go, I have had many experiences with various student care (as the children will usually go to a student care near their school). Hope student care is the the BEST of all Iâ€™d seen. The teachers are very caring, patient and sincere. Despite some of my foster kids being quite challenging, I never had to worry about their school work, they get guided and ensure on top of each child. They have holiday activities, many of which are free, that are well thought and amazing - Iâ€™ve seen none of these in other places! Best of all, management is superb - ms Samantha is the most real and kind hearted that you could hope for. I am most grateful for their genuine love and care for my kids. Thank you!!ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104375420136928186717/reviews
