      "text": "Absolutely appalled by the rudeness and the terrible service of the staff from this place. There’s big sized older man with the headgear on who is just completely unfriendly and rude towards customers.\n\nThere were no cutleries left and upon checking this with them, he just gave a random spoon. Was unsure if it’s washed as he just took it out of nowhere and clearly it was not at the usual dedicated space.\n\nIn turn, I received a backlash of “are you out of your mind? Would anyone give a dirty spoon?” This was shocking.\n\nReally spoiled my appetite and I regret the decision of heading to this stall. Absolutely certain that I’d not patron this place and recommend others to stay away unless they’re ok with rude encounters here.\n\nI should have just headed to the other place (Aladdin’s Castle restaurant) nearby where the service is good and the staff is friendly.",
