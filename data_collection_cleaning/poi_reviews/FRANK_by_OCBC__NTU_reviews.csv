ErnÊÅ©,1,"My application was rejected but they didn't even send a notice to me until I called their helpline. I went to this branch several times and all they know is to ""help me check first"" and then nothing else. Basically solve nothing at all and they have a very low efficiency in operating things.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109088960859019740965/reviews
pao phuwit,1,"Hi, I called from oversea and no one picked up at all.

I need help that your useless faq cannot solve.

Since I got a problem and could not log in.
the only solution is to call and I call from oversea.

Not a single soul picked up my call for 30 mins on hold???

I am truly impressed",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117655276579992683308/reviews
E Wong,1,"The customer service hotline is not helpful so I came down to the branch, but there's no staff here, at 3pm! It's not even lunch time and there's no staff. Do you only have 1 staff at each branch? Or haven't you heard about staggering lunch hours?",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117927234559079101177/reviews
