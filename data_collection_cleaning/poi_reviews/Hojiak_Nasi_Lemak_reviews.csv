Lee ZY,1,"First time buying and found a strand of hair in the beehoon! Low standards. 3 packets for $15.10 (3 ingredient each, no seafood/premium items) not exactly cheap or economical. Never again for me.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116440354502491920939/reviews
Jeff Sim,1,"The standard is getting bad to worse...
In fact,  the Hougang Otah prepacked Nasi Lemak tasted so much better..

This store, the ikan bilis is chewy instead of crunchy, rice is soggy, peanut is tasteless.

The lady serving it also got one kind of an attitude...

Won't be buying from them anytime soon.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118426126313421974951/reviews
Yvonne Bong Swee Kee,5,"I came across this new stall while passing by the area and decided to give it a try. The rendang chicken was delicious and reasonably priced, but my favourite is still the Ayam Merah (red chicken). The sauce is incredible—it really enhances my appetite! The nasi lemak and chicken wings were also great. I’ll definitely be back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111390993774746227697/reviews
Shiela Kim,4,"It’s newly opened restaurants in Food paradise Fernvale link area. The price is very reasonable and the taste is not so bad.

We’ve tried their bee hoon set and the chicken rendang rice set. It was a bit salty but still taste good. If you come a bit early, you can try their kway teow and other type of noodles.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103187116620220847179/reviews
Gratto Scotto,4,Food hits my palate at the right spot. Ordered bee hoon with chicken rendang. Beehoon has the right amount of moisture [which is not much) and there is the wok hey within. Love the chicken rendang; the portion given is just nice for a plate of bee hoon and the chicken inside is very juicy and tender. Too bad the kopitiam it is in has too little ventilation to enjoy this dish fully.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102842962790607868497/reviews
