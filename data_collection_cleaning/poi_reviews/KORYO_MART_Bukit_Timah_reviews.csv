Timothy,1,"The male boss is very rude. We were looking around for some strawberries and just when we are about to purchase, he snatched it from us and told us to leave, randomly saying the strawberries were sold out when there were clearly cartons of strawberrries lying around. We were only in the shop for less than 5 minutes when he snatched the strawberries from us and told us to ""go outside"".",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116278987759994697530/reviews
SeungJun Kim,5,"Don't understand some of the hate towards this store. This Korean shop sells soju & noodles & chips at reasonable prices, and sells certain noodle brands which you can never buy from NTUC/Fairprice/Giant etc. Yes, some of the stuffs here may be more costly as compared to NTUC/Fairprice/Giant. Then just don't buy those stuffs from here? Don't see the point of some people giving 2/3 stars because of those reasons. Personally, this is a go-to place to purchase Korean products, especially soju & noodles",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100958975977925692266/reviews
張琮傑,1,"The shop owner is very rude.

Me and my friend was trying to find the Newjeans peperon in the shop, and the shop owner suddely came to us out of no where and said: ""go outside"".

I don't know what's wrong with the shop owner, but I feel very angry about the way I treated us. We were just finding something we wanted to buy, we didn't do any iligal thing, and we didn't say anything bad about the shop and the shop owner himself. I still can't forgive the way he treated us. I didn't ask for good customer service, but forcing customers to get out from the shop out of no where like this is too much.

I will never come back to this shop.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112312715997993731315/reviews

For me, it is first time to visit korean market so I was very glad to see the korean products.
