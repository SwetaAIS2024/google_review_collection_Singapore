"Yong Hui, Ronny Tan",4,"+ The stall sells quite a range of noodles, including sliced fish soup. But it seems to be not a traditional Singaporean- owned noodle stall either. Eg it sells fishball noodle soup, but not the dry version. Ditto for d dumpling lamian which only comes in soup form. I suspect it's because the owner/ operator seems to be China nationality.

+ Noodle portion was big , as is seemingly common amongst China- nationality operated noodle stalls. But the ingredients themselves weren't that much, at least for d bak chor mee.

+ Located in quiet hidden corner of the estate. Less hot and expensive compared to the other nearby coffeeshop at 209B Clementi Ave 6.

+ Ample sheltered MSCP parking next door.

- Few other stall options in this coffeeshop if your companions want to try something else.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103854866816776797/reviews

Wilson Foo,2,"Located in Clementi Ave 6, I arrived at 7.22pm and found the kopitiam to be deserted. This noodle stall offers ban mian and fish soup.

Ordered thin noodles and watched them cook. All seems well until I saw the cook pinch deep fried ikan bilis with her bare hands from a container and dropped them into my bowl of noodles. Cardinal sin.

There was mock abalone, sliced pork and mince meat in the bowl. Noodles were cooked al dente but it was strangely sweet in taste. So was the soup. I have had a lot of ban mian but never one that tasted sweet.

Draw your own conclusions.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263857328212431619/reviews
