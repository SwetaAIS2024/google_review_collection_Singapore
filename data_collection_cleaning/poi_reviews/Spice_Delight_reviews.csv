WR X (Toujiang),1,"My previous experience with this stall was good, which is why I returned - especially since they offer a wider variety of kuehs. However, when I asked the lady at the stall a few times about the differences, she became impatient and used her handle to press the kuehs without much care. Feeling she was rude, I commented on her behavior and walked away. How can we better support neighborhood stalls and be more welcoming to foreigners in such situations?",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106628219080086132384/reviews

Mackaz Sajiaos Tan,3,"Nestled discreetly among the bustling stalls of the local market, this humble gem has captured my heart with its unparalleled Nasi Lemak. As a self-proclaimed aficionado of this beloved Malaysian dish, finding a stall that consistently delivers such exquisite flavors has been a true delight.

The hallmark of their Nasi Lemak lies in its simplicity yet depth of flavor. The coconut-infused rice, fragrant and perfectly cooked, forms a harmonious base complemented by a medley of accompaniments. The sambal, a fiery symphony of chili and spices, strikes a perfect balance of heat and sweetness, elevating each bite to a new level of satisfaction. The crispy anchovies add a delightful crunch, while the boiled egg and fresh cucumber slices provide refreshing contrasts.

What truly sets this stall apart is not just the quality of their food but also the warmth and authenticity of their service. The staff's genuine passion for their culinary craft shines through in every dish they serve, creating an inviting and memorable dining experience.

For anyone seeking a taste of authentic Nasi Lemak that leaves a lasting impression, this stall is an absolute must-visit.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108614244530036867769/reviews
