      "text": "I recently visited this restaurant to celebrate one of my family birthday, but unfortunately, the experience was extremely disappointing. We ordered the battered fish and chips, but the wait was excessively long - almost 90 minutes. Despite the wait, the dish never arrived, and we received no update or response from the staff.\n\nDue to the prolonged wait and lack of communication, we decided to cancel our order for the battered fish and chips. This was not only frustrating but also ruined the special occasion for the birthday person.\n\nThe service was overwhelmed, and we had to call multiple times to get their attention. They forgot to serve one of the soups, and the main dishes were not served together. The baked rice dishes arrived around the same time, but the fish and chips (had it arrived) would have taken an additional 30-45 minutes longer than the baked rice.\n\nWhen we brought the issue to the staff's attention, they kept saying they would check with the kitchen, but it took another 20-30 minutes with no response or resolution. The lack of communication and service was unpleasant and disappointing.\n\nAlthough the food we did receive was alright, the poor service and long wait times significantly affected our mood and overall experience. It would have been much better if all the main dishes were served at the same time, which would have greatly improved the dining experience.\n\nConsidering the poor experience, I would not recommend this restaurant, especially for special occasions.",

      "text": "Swensens at Clementi Mall provides a welcoming atmosphere with its pleasant ambience. Special mention goes to Anni, their intern staff member, whose friendly service and warm demeanor enhanced our dining experience. üëçüèª\n\nTheir membership program offers excellent value with complimentary drinks and fries. While most dishes meet expectations, we experienced a disappointing 30-minute wait for the pesto salmon, which arrived disappointingly dry. Despite this, the restaurant remains a decent choice for casual dining, thanks to its comfortable setting and membership perks. 3.5/5 stars.",

Food presentation was below average and tastes so so, but Hazel, who the management trainee saved the day. Food was served slow but the service and ambience was decent. Might I say the ice creams also lack variety, can‚Äôt top my usual ice cream craves.\n\nPlease improve your food and service or else you end up like the chains in US (closed) ;( I don‚Äôt hope this is the last time I dine at Swensen\n\nWill give it another shot at a different branch.

Ordering was a breeze via the tablet on the table. Was able to redeem a free drink and fries with swensen membership on telegram. Food was served soon after - relatively short wait time due to off peak period. Food was great but felt they are quite pricey compared to few years back. Definitely a recommended place for special occasions with family/ friends.",
