      "text": "Highly recommend the egg fried rice, also called the Singapore Fried Rice on the menu. The fried rice is really nice with plenty of \"wok hey\". Remember to get their dried chilli garnish to go with the fried rice - it is  made in-house and goes so well with the egg fried rice. Apart from fried rice, you can also get a wide range of bbq and Zi Char items here. I'll definitely come back for more egg fried rice! ðŸ˜‹",

      "text": "+ Very friendly boss uncle.\n\n+ Great taste. Excellent smokey rice frying, albeit not that salty. Add the superb chilli oil condiment to spice it up.\n\n+ The stall sells more than just fried rice. Look out for their reasonably-priced spaghetti and even BBQ Stingray.\n\n+ Located in quiet hidden corner of the estate. Less hot and expensive compared to the other nearby coffeeshop at 209B Clementi Ave 6.\n\n+ Ample sheltered MSCP parking next door.\n\n- Few other stall options in this coffeeshop if your companions want to try something else.",
