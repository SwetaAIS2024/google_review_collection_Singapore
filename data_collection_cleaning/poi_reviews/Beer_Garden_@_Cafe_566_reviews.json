      "text": "Not sure if my review is fair because we went on a random Sunday without booking. This restaurant was preparing for some CNY group booking then. So we went in and they have nice dinosaurs and animals outside, and yes not many are left. So we went in. We ordered the Puâ€™er teapot ($13), Signature Hor Fun ($14) and crispy noodle ($7). The service was good as the uncle was humble and asked for our every need. And their last order was 3pm. The crispy noodle had some not so good vegetables but signature hor fun was good as it came with many great stuff. Highly recommended to eat this. The tea was fine. Toilet is pretty exotic cos they designed it with old Chinese shophouse doors but it was all dampy so pls avoid wearing bridal gowns there.",

Unfortunately not much of the dinosaurs or animal figures left. After dining, there is a cosy KTV lounge where you can spent your entire evening there.",
