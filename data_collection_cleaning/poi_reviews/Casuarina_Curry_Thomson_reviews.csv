Judy Huang,5,"Trying out new Indian places is always fun, and this one hit the spot

• Appan Jala Set
The curry is quite spicy, but it goes really  well with the sweet, moist pancake (3pcs). The chicken was tender, tho the portion wasn’t very generous
• Thosai with Egg
Came with a few curry sauces. Spice level was alright. Tasted pretty normal overall
• Egg Benedict Prata
Not the best I’ve had, but still decent quality. The ham hidden inside the prata was a pleasant surprise
• Iced Milo Tarik
Just the way I like it",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100383338300088014362/reviews
Kaixuan Wu,5,"I cannot stop waxing lyrical or salivate over what I consider to be the ""OG"" crispy prata. My kids love it even though they can't describe properly which prata place it is (Jalan kayu, springleaf etc....)

Well, this is THE ONE. The one ""papa brought them to"". This is the best of the best. Casuarina Curry. CC.

They even had a prata cook out session when I was there, (I'm guessing some corporate team building event? What a way. Instead of flopping alone, they flip pratas together. What a change in perspective. They should have WSQ for this) As I could see multiple individuals flipping (not flopping) pratas on the table tops, I was concerned that our order would be delayed. Miraculously, our pratas actually came faster than expected. How Casuarina Curry does it, I can only speculate with wonder, amazement, and gratitude.

Bian Lee,4,"We were there for breakfast after our walk on a Friday. The place is not crowded.

We had Masala chicken and two prata. Masala chicken was good but Prata was
just normal, could have been more crispy to our liking.. the complimentary curry tasted pretty good as compared to others. The tek Halia was well balanced with fragrant tea and good dosage of ginger. We love it!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106963842817729813226/reviews
Ming Hui,4,"Was recommended by a friend to try this. I've tried springleaf and a few other al almeen/ Al Azhar kind of restaurants and I would say casuarina might be my least favourite.

The prata is crispy yes but maybe slightly too crispy. Overall I think the taste lacks slightly as compared to the other places but regardless it will be suitable for those who prefer crispier prata.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108198322351045531056/reviews
