There’s nothing special about the bagel and I’m unsure if it’s homemade.\n\nThe purple pickled cabbage is really good even though I don’t normally like it. Super refreshing and balances the pulled pork well.\n\nSlightly expensive for the quality, hence the 3 stars.",

      "text": "We got the brekkie and the porky on a Sunday afternoon. We didn’t have to wait very long for our orders and there’s a bit of room for eating in. The flavours were great, the pickled cabbage stole the show for the Porky. The texture of the bagel was soft and not very chewy (unlike the NY style). So overall  great sandwich but not the most ideal if you’re looking for something chewy with a crisp exterior.\n\nI would recommend eating the bagels quickly if you’re getting takeaway as the more savoury/saucy options may get soggy quite quickly.",

Kinda prefer the breakie as eggs and bacon combo is good. The Luncheon had super thick cuts of luncheonmeat but it was too thick for our liking.",
