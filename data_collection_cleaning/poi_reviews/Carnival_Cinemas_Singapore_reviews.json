      "text": "Carnival Cinemas offers a good movie experience, especially if you're into Indian or regional films. The auditorium is quite spacious, which adds to the comfort during screenings. While the seating could use some upgrades for better comfort, it’s still a decent setup for the price you pay.\n\nOne of the highlights here is the affordability—not just the tickets, but the movie snacks too. It's one of the few places where you can still grab popcorn and drinks without feeling overcharged. The overall atmosphere is casual and welcoming, making it a good spot for a relaxed movie night.",
