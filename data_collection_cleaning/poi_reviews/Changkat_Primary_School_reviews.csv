seraphim,2,"You know the problem I have with this school? The TEACHERS. I am currently studying here and I noticed tht a lot of teachers here are BIASED. They only point out my mistake and my friends. And when others does the same thing, they close their eyes.. üòíü§® (this prob happened to others too) the teachers are also so meannnn. If somebody failed, they don't cover it up. They try to CALL OUT ON YOU indirectly or directly. Sometimes, they like to make students feel stupid. They kept pointing out on ppl who constantly failed. Even when they try to ""help"" it always sound backhanded. ""Oh only ur group can discuss the rest cannotü•∫"" js stop. There's no need to give ""special treatment"" on students who r weak in certain subjects. Like, we know you look down on us. That's like a humiliation if u do that in front of everybody. The other students will think that these students are dumb. Their grades will drop further and their confidence will dropped drastically. If you really wanna help a student, make sure you DON'T destroy their confidence. The teachers srsly doesn't care abt students' privacy. So disappointing.. üòí don't send your kids to this school unless you want your kids to be insecure.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116488461860974916384/reviews
