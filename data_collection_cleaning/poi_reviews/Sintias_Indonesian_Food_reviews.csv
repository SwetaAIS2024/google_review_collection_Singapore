Saifu Angto,3,"Surprised to find Indonesian Food at the Empress Market.  It serves a variety of noodle and rice dishes, and some ala carte side orders.

Tried the Mee Rebus, it's quite tasty and very generous serving for a very reasonable price.  The fried chicken side order looks yummy but did not try.  Maybe next time.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
