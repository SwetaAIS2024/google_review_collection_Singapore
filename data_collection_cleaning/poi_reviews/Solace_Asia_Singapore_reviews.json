I was surprised to know some of the clinical staffs are Singaporeans and I felt closer to home. The clinical team was very caring and professional and the treatment center is beautiful. The aftercare team stayed in touch with me every month now after I completed the program. Out there, I know I am not alone. I’m almost a year sober now and the only regret I have was how wished I had gone sooner to Solace Sabah.",

The counselors focussed on the deepest issues I had and camp up with a personal plan for me to tackle these. It was definitely a great new experience for me as I learned how to deal with sobriety and the hardships that I may face going into unhealthy environments when leaving treatment program. I would certainly recommend this center to Singaporeans!",
