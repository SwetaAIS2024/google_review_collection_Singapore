There were literally ppl who queue together with her colleagues press out cash at the atm? I had to literal shout at her because she was being so rude and didnâ€™t ask us nicely. She just butt into my mom and start to shout at us bruh",

Needed to replace my card asap but for some reason not only must you go to a video teller machine, its the only machine there and it does not work.. If you need help with something or need to get your card replaced don't even bother wasting your time here, also it swallowed my previous card so another reason not to come here for any other reason than to withdraw or deposit money",
