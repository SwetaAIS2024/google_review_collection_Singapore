Rick Ng,5,"The Signature Wanton Noodle has generous amount of char siew, fried meat dumplings, boiled meat dumplings and greens on curly thin egg noodle. It is a delicious dish.

Wonder why someone go around and give all the stalls in Bukit Batok West Hawker Centre ratings of 3 just to write a short description without trying the dishes. It is so unfair to the F&B operators here. Google Maps is full of rubbishes from people so eager to be ""Top Reviewer"" and not giving proper reviews.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103499781517934198543/reviews
