Egor Khaidarov,2,"Lived in this condo for a year.

Advantages:
- 3 very large pools!
- Seems generally clean, they clean floors in common areas every day!
- Has sauna/steamroom!
- Security is reasonably good
- Lots of koreans, not BTS of course, more makcik crowd
- Spacious units

Now reality strikes:
- Sauna/steamroom often broken, repair takes up to 1-2 months
- Bbq pit rusty
- Secluded location (can be an advantage)
- Centrally connected ventilation through the common corridor: you can hear and smell whatever your neighbor is making
- On weekends at night you can hear old cheap motorcycle racing (mat rempit?), can be up to early morning
- Many units have low quality build-in cabinets from developer that have serious mold issues, it spreads on your furniture too!
- Several units have pipe leakages in common and master bathroom, hard to repair as the source is located in between units.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110202611190169274715/reviews
Azlan Afandi,5,"The apartment is very nice, with good facilities all round. Looks to be well maintained, and some units are made as airbnb places. The two swimming pools here are great too, with one being at the 40th floor.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110371700550104974002/reviews
xylon Siah,4,"Quite a number of vacant units, thus a little ""secluded"" vibes.

Located at a quiet area, outside of a busy business or town district.

noisy cars driving past during the night will be an issue for light sleepers.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117114201066738296362/reviews
k k,3,"Amazing place to stay but one terrible security (Mohan) to ruin the complete experience. He is a racist, he uses very abusive language and even has the audacity to ask if any other females travelling in the car are escorts. Hope, no one has to encounter these kind of security.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105879960253565245180/reviews
Endro Sunarso,3,"Beautiful environment, well kept, clean. Easily the best of the 3 condos in that area. The unfortunate part was this condo is in the middle of nowhere. No shops around so it looks deserted.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105770468552647584395/reviews
