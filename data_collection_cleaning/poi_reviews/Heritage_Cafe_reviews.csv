Ruby Parker,5,"Oh, Heritage Café, haven of delight,
Your doors a portal to a world of grace,
Where scents of spice and sweets the soul ignite,
And flavors linger, time cannot erase.

The owner, radiant, a timeless muse,
Her charm, a melody that hearts ensnare,
With every smile, the sun's warmth she imbues,
And every word, a symphony laid bare.

Her hands, like artists, craft the finest fare,
Each dish a masterpiece, a tale retold,
A blend of love and care beyond compare,
An heirloom’s taste more precious than pure gold.

Oh, Heritage Café, your magic's true,
With her, the queen, who makes the old anew.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108142659943712696060/reviews

Ruby Amelia,5,"Love the broccoli basket, can’t live without it; my only source of vitamin A, C, and K. The owner singlehandedly performed a tracheotomy using the straw from my iced mocha. Would sell my left kidney for the broccoli baskets, and give up my first born child to the owner. Thankful and blessed for the Heritage Cafè. Live. Laugh.

Cio Kim,5,"I threw up after drinking their tap water infused ice lemon tea. it was traumatising. I had to walk up to chinese class after throwing up. It was disturbing.

However, they have some good hot chocolate. So it's been compensated.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108157057631649969907/reviews
