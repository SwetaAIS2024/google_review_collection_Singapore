But I still come to this place but just concerned with this kind of service. My suggestion just don’t work if not in the mood, my smoothies taste like water",

The person who runs the place is really friendly and kind because, he gave us superb hospitality. He even gave us complimentary bar bites as we were the first few to enter the bar. He even moved all his furnitures for me as i was in a wheelchair. Very nice people working in the bar. I strongly recommend this bar.",
