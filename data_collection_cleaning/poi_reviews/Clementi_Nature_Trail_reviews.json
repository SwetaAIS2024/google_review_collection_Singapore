Running next to Ulu Pandan Road winding up a gentle slope it ends at a forested area (not connected yet, so you need to U-Turn back).\nAs the young trees were newly planted, it may not provide enough good shade.\nNonetheless, enjoy the tranquility it offers.",

Seems to be poor planning as this trail is completed more than a year ago but is somehow left undone with a dead end that hits a wall of forest. The original landscape was amazingly pretty but due to poor planning and disuse the trail is quite overgrown by now.",
