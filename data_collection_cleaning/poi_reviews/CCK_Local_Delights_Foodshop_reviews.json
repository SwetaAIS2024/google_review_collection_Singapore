Kosong ah??” (empty in Malay). Her pretentious attitude and subsequent muttering made me feel humiliated and embarrassed.\n\nWhen I tried to clarify with another staff member whether ordering without side dishes was allowed, they completely ignored me, adding to the overall negative experience.\n\nSuch appalling customer service is unacceptable. I will never patronize this stall again and strongly advise others to avoid it.",
