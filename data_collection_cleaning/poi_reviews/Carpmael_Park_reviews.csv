Justin Xiao,4,"Small neighborhood playground. They are plenty of seats. That's okay for a quick rest but they are very few playground equipment for kids. I think they could definitely put more since they're only two swings in the entire playground /park. It's easy to miss on Carmel road. So if you're looking for it, you have to trust Google maps to guide you there because it's not clearly seen from the end of the street.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114147367394477307367/reviews
Ash,2,Carpmael park is a pretty boring park with extremely boring facilities even though the climbing areas may interest children. It's a very small park and can be quite noisy as it is very near the road. The best part is lots of small flowers on the road nearby,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111164444158949376534/reviews
Swen George,4,"Found this park while cycling by on a weekend. It's quite shady and cosy, and can be visited on a hot day. Coming here with a young child is good as there is a climbing station, for them to play and also a few other things like swings. For the adults there are benches too.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110471314649207916326/reviews
