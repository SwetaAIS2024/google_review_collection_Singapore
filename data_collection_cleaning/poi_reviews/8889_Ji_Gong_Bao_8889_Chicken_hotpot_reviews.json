      "text": "Tried this chicken hot pot place recently, and honestly, it was one of the worst food experiences we've had in a long time. First off, the price – $7.50 for dine-in and $7.80 for takeaway – might sound okay at first glance, but for what you get? It's a joke. The portion was pathetic. Barely any ingredients, just a sad splash of broth with some scattered bits trying to pass as a meal. Felt more like a side dish than an actual meal.\n\nNow, the service – or complete lack of it – was another disaster. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes. We were patient. But when we checked back after 15 minutes, the person in charge casually threw out another “15 minutes” with no apology, just excuses. Not even a hint of customer service. It felt like they just say whatever to get you off their back.\n\nThis place seriously lacks value and respect for customers' time and money. Save your $7.50 and go get something that doesn’t leave you annoyed, hungry, and ripped off. Never again.",
