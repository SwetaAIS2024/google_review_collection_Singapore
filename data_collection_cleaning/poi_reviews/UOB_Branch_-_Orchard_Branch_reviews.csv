Phoebe Lim,5,"I had the privilege of meeting customer service manager, Miss Sharon Teo yesterday afternoon.
I would like to commend Sharon on her excellent customer service.
From the moment I stepped into the branch, Sharon was all smiling, friendly and attentive. And she was extremely knowledgeable with UOB prducts, explaining to me patiently and clearly about Stash and One accounts and other UOB accounts.
I have ever enquired about Stash account with other UOB branches but still, i wasn't clear at all until I met Sharon today. She has left such a great impression and she really takes pride in her job and goes beyond her job scope. UOB should be proud of having Sharon in the team and she deserves to be commended. Thank you very much Sharon.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116546791950240893298/reviews
Rainbow,5,"I had one of the best experiences at this UOB branch. First I was greeted by Sharon Teo, she was friendly, helpful and proactive at the receiving desk. None of the banks,  including other banks, I have visited has assigned a staff so warm and knowledgeable at the front desk. Subsequently, I was served by Quek Si Min at the counter, she was very professional, prompt and sincere. I truly enjoyed this UOB branch.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109503534573475167905/reviews
