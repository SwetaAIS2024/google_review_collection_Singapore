      "text": "The service here is abysmal, an absolute joke. I've experienced it firsthand and watched the staff shamelessly treat other customers like garbage right in front of me. Their atrocious attitudes completely ruined any chance of enjoying the meal. Speaking of which, the food is just as terrible. The Egg and Cheese Ramyeon was bland, lifeless, and a disgrace to anything resembling Korean cuisine. Chicken is raw? Helloo wake up the damn idea. The quality is laughable. Whoever was working at 12pm on 10th January 2025 should be fired or retrained because their 'customer service' is nothing short of pathetic. Avoid this place unless you enjoy being disrespected and eating tasteless slop.",
