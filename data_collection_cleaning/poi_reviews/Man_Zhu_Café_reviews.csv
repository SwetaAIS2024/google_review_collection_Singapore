Isaac Sam,5,"This local restaurant at the Chinese Swimming Club serves delicious and reasonably priced local delights. The Crispy Noodles were perfectly done, topped with fresh seafood and rich, thick gravy. The Fried Chicken Wings were served piping hot and crispy‚Äîan absolute must-try. The Rojak was well-balanced in flavour, while the Fried Rice with salted fish was packed with irresistible wok hei. A fantastic spot for satisfying local fare!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108426703400532001032/reviews
L T,4,"Great dining place that is spacious and the menu offers a wide range of cuisines that is sure to please. Apart from many local delights, there‚Äôs also Western and Chinese items. We ordered the satay which was alright but the Rojak was outstanding. The sauce is light and the taste was a good balance of sweet, sour, salty and spicy.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112021794976187105345/reviews
Dels Passions,5,"It's always a nice experience dining here.
(Note: will be crowded on last week of every month coz everyone is trying to dine so that you can get their F&B levy waived! Lol.)

Love it that they always try to improve their menu. Their lunch sets are always a good deal.

Love their Singapore Rojak, Lobster Bisque Pasta, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Chicken confit, and Prawn Noodles.

Here's a tip: Add about 10pcs of Chili Padi into your rojak and give it a good stir. It adds a kick to the dish!! Brings it to a next level! üå∂üå∂üå∂",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103422022097897434720/reviews
Jason L,5,"Seems like an odd way to get security to ‚Äúgate‚Äù access to the restaurant instead of escorting guests to the restaurant to meet the club members they can be assumed to be meeting with or have a reservation against.

Other than the operational failure of sorts in my mind, everything else was great! Food prepared and presented well, service staff (not so much the robot server) were polite and helpful.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113673941052367532897/reviews
