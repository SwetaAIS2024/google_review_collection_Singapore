      "text": "Worse experience ever – avoid this hotel at all costs!\n\nFrom the moment I stepped near the entrance, I had a bad feeling. The place looked filthy and poorly maintained. As soon as I entered the lobby, I was hit with a strong, fishy, unpleasant smell that only got worse upstairs.\n\nThe first room they gave me was crawling with cockroaches and ants – literally everywhere. I immediately went to the receptionist and asked for a room change. Shockingly, the second room was even worse. The aircon was broken, the bathroom was disgusting, and the pest problem was just as bad, if not worse. It felt more like a horror movie set than a hotel room.\n\nHonestly, it was a nightmare to stay even for an hour. I cannot believe a hotel like this is allowed to operate in Singapore, a city known for cleanliness. There's clearly zero pest control or hygiene standards here, and yet they have the audacity to charge SGD 90 per night? For what exactly? Roaches and sleepless nights?\n\nThis place needs an urgent inspection, pest control, and a serious lesson in basic hospitality. Do yourself a favor and stay far away.",

      "text": "It was a business trip. When I was Google the hotel, it was look decent. I booked a double bedded room for 06 nights through a reputed Singapore travel agent. But when I checked into the hotel, I was very disappointed.\nIt's a self service very old budget property, divided into a two portions; they give rent some rooms of one portion to tourists and other portion is a mass for workers. There is no elevator service, stairs are high, very difficult to move up and down with luggage.\n\nTiny old room with a small dirty washroom, no window or ventilation. A bed with side table and a dressing table; that's all in the room. No table for work nor a chair in the room. As a Muslim, I need to perform Salah, but no space for my prayer, I managed it in very difficult way.\nIt was cost 85 Singapore Dollar per night without breakfast, no room service, even no one cleaned my washroom in those 6 days. They gave 02 small bottled water on the first day, and then never provided any.\n\nThey give rent rooms for hourly basis. So whole day people walk in passage and talk loudly, even in the mid night.\n\nBut one thing I must admit that the Chinese man works in the reception is very helpful. He carried my luggage both on arrival and departure days. He helped me to book a taxi for the airport transfer on the last day.\n\nThis is a worst hotel I ever stayed in. It doesn't deserve any Star, but I gave a star only for that reception guy.",
