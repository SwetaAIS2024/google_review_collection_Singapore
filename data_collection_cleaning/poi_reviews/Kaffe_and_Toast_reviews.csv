Faisal Sayed,2,"Great spot for local delicacies that I've been frequenting for a long time. On this visit, I tried the location at Joo Koon during a trip to Decathlon. The place was just okay. The food didn’t taste as good as what I’m used to at Kent Ridge. The Milo dinosaur drink was watery, the iced lemon tea was too strong, and the coffee was cold. With no other options and kids with us, we had to eat there, even though it was already late for lunch. As it's a food chain, they should definitely look into improving the quality of their food.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109463431360413596078/reviews

Shawn Ong,1,"Meesiam and boat noodles were so horrible that we only took one mouth before we decided to walk over to Encik tan for lunch. When we cleared our food , we saw many other orders that were hardly touched at the tray return counter.

Good luck to the owner if they continue to have such horrible standard.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115462167717012714443/reviews
Ihsan Ruzaini,5,"Can only give review based on my personal experience here on 27 Oct. Great beef brisket and the muslim staff with the headscarf was accommodating. I accidentally pressed takeaway unknowingly on the kiosk and maybe her instinct seeing my settling down with all my stuff on the table made her double checked if i really wanted to takeaway or dine in. Alas, her situational awareness had saved us all the hassle.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112534628303857802656/reviews
