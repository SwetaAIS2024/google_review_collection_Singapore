Omolade A,5,"We booked Maxi-Cab services for a large group in Dec and from the planning to booking, the service was 10/10!
The driving service was amazing as well. Always on time, smooth rides and also provided recommendations on things to do as well how to plan out our already planned activities. Will highly recommend their service.
Thank you for giving my friends and I a memorable trip.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100512183771737822725/reviews
