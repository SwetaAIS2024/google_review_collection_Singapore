Sylvia Kwok,5,"Halal Chinese Style Seafood Restaurant in Joo Chiat area.
It's located at the stretch of the shop houses, easily accessed by public transport.

We arrived at lunch time, ordered Stir Fry Asparagus, Fish Slice with Black Bean Sauce, and Spicy Pepper Lala. All the dishes area delicious. Portions were generous. Growing up eating seafood every day, my mom is very picky when it came to seafood meal, but she kept praising that fish was very fresh, smooth and fragrant.

Service is fast. Staffs are friendly. Environment is calm and clean. Recommend to have a good meal with friends and families.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104599184851719504220/reviews

TL TL,5,"Tasty halal certified Chinese seafood style dishes üòã

üçõ Chicken fried rice ($10): This dish was really tasty as each grain of rice was coated evenly with the sauce and the amount of chicken slices were substantial too.

üçú House special white bee hoon ($10): I love bee hoon so this was a must-order for me. Loved the flavorful broth which was soaked up by all the bee hoon.

üçó Crispy shrimp paste chicken ($16): An essential dish to order here as the wings were crispy and flavorful! This would definitely be a hit with everyone especially kids!

All the dishes tasted great and would come back next time to try the other dishes especially their seafood!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109561163306994863573/reviews
Jasmine,5,"Had a great dinner at Home of Seafood with family. We ordered the Prestige Set Meal, where we got to choose dishes from each category, and also added on Fish Fillet with Ginger & Spring Onion and Homemade Prawn Rolls. Everything was well-prepared, with the Cereal Prawns, fish fillet, and Prawn Rolls being our favorites.

The restaurant is housed in a charming heritage shophouse, adding to the dining experience. Service was efficient, and they offer an affordable lunch set menu and a wide range of sushi as well. Would definitely recommend for a Halal-certified Chinese seafood feast!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101820530424899244665/reviews
Another Big Bite,5,"Totally be spoiled for choice, there are many √Ä la carte dishes and value lunch sets to choose from. We love to eat fish so we chose Set E $35.90++ from the weekday lunch value set menu. We selected from the 4 different ways the fish & vegetable dishes are being prepared - Teochew style Steamed Seabass and HK Kailan fried with garlic. All sets come with 2 bowls of fragrant rice. A satisfied & delicious meal! Happy that our order was served promptly. A great place for halal Chinese-style seafood whether it‚Äôs a banquet or a simple meal. Recommend to try.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100408883882614888601/reviews
