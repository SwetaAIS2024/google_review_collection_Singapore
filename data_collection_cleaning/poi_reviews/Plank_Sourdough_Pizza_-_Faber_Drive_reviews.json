The sourdough pizza at Plank was lovely and accompanying it with Baker & Cook's cream pasta was awesome. We had a flatwhite and the coffee aroma was commendable. The staff were friendly and the place was not too crowded although we did give up our spacious table for a larger party who would appreciate a larger table and more space. Happy with our meal here!",
