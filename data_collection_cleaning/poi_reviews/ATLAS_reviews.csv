Khasseli Tanuwijaya,5,"From the moment I walked into Atlas Bar, I was captivated by its breathtaking Art Deco design‚Äîit felt like stepping into a glamorous time capsule. The towering gin collection and opulent gold accents made the ambiance truly special. The food was just as impressive; the lobster rolls were indulgent, and the prawn spaghetti was perfectly balanced in flavor. Service was impeccable, making the entire experience seamless and enjoyable. Whether for a casual evening or a special celebration, Atlas Bar is a place I‚Äôll keep coming back to.  ü•∞üôèüèª",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238627369923487051/reviews
Daneal Hon,4,"A nice spot for people who favors a great ambience over anything else. Don't get me wrong, the food was above average and the price is reasonable for the entire setup. But you'll get more bang for your buck in other places. I wished the service was a bit more attentive for the price that's all. Definitely worth coming for the experience/decor and a few shameless selfies.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107676489535634212392/reviews
Chelsey Chen,5,"Came here for the high tea. Managed to get the reservation weeks prior.
Crowded even though it‚Äôs a weekday. However despite being full house the service and drinks are still impeccable.
Our table was served by John and he was so patient and sincere despite them being busy. We had a wonderful time thanks to the nice drinks and the great service! When we left John even gave us a nice little surprise. We were super grateful.
A must visit if you‚Äôre a tourist to Singapore. Make reservations first though.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108245270222060539171/reviews

Fab Foodie Swede Malin Nordblom,5,"One of the worlds 50 best bars, and I totally agree. The stunning Art Deco interior matches the cozy seating. Their cocktails are well worth a visit or two. And their gin selection is amazing! This is a must if you visit Singapore and like cocktails.
Dress up and enjoy a decadent evening!(afternoon)
