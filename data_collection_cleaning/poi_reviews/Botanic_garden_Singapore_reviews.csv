Monytep,5,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is an absolute gem in the heart of the city. This place offers something for everyone, whether you love nature, are a casual visitor, or seek a peaceful escape from city life. The gardens are beautifully maintained, with lush greenery, vibrant flowers, and plenty of shaded spots to relax.

One of the highlights is the National Orchid Garden, where you can see a breathtaking collection of orchids, including hybrids named after famous personalities. Another lovely spot is Swan Lake, featuring graceful swans swimming across the water. If you’re into history and conservation, the Learning Forest and the Rainforest section are worth exploring.

Whether you’re here for a morning jog, a leisurely stroll, or just to soak in the beauty of nature, the Singapore Botanic Gardens never disappoints. Highly recommended!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107995291047864098479/reviews
Thibault Cardona,5,"Calm and rejuvenating place. Very few people for a Saturday. It's very easy to see otters and monitor lizards.
