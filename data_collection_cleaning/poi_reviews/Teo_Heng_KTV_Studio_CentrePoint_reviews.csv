Don Regis,5,"The room was ok, good speakers and mic.  Takes a while to get used to the karaoke machine here in SG.  Thankfully there's youtube for songs not found in the machine.  Overall very nice, best karaoke place so far.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100878438149131040774/reviews
Keith K,4,"Teo Heng is very ""family friendly"", and has one of the lowest prices in town. Outside food & drinks are allowed, as only limited soft drinks are for sale on-site for $1. The Centrepoint location is convenient. Rooms are a little small and not very fancy. The sound system and song selection are decent. I'd recommend them if you are just looking for a cheap, no-frills, fun time singing with friends!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106060662714156716341/reviews
Branda,1,"Horrible customer service with poor business ethics. Spoke to 3 different staffs but only got the name of the last staff by the name of May.

Initially told me they have small room from 5pm to 8pm and the minimum booking is 2 hours so I proceeded to book from 5pm to 7pm but they said I have to book till 8pm because it means no one will book the room from 7pm to 8pm. I told them I only need to book for 2 hours and I will fulfil the minimum 2 hours policy so why can’t I book from 5pm to 7pm.

So they are technically forcing me to book for 3 hours even though the company policy is 2 hours.

If they observe operational issues on their business processes then shouldn’t they refine and improvise instead of forcing it on their customers?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113483068874524014123/reviews
Nic,1,"Staff needs training on managing basic bookings. They cannot handle simple task and i had repeat myself over and over again to three different staff, to resolve a simple request. Jackson Teo will be proud of these three staff, including May. Poor customer service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112947553308166399437/reviews
Skye Cai,4,"New release songs are available. Most of them with correct lyrics.
They are very strict on time, late also won’t give more minutes.
3 minutes before the session, can’t click to the next song.
Can bring in your own food and drinks.
Small KTV rooms.
The atmospheres is great.
Poor services.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
