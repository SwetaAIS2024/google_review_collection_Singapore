      "text": "i had ordered their fish n chips and chicken chop from here before. their chicken chop is absolutely worth and delicious (their gravy is NOT), comes with spaghetti and corn. and their fish n chips were DELICIOUS, or at a year ago. i just ordered, and watched them make it. they fried my already fried fish (so… refry??), then cut it in half and microwaved it. and i wonder why my fish is so dry and hard!! this is legit the worst fish and chips ever and mind u it’s not considered cheap for this type of food. it’s so dry the fish is flaking, and so hard that it can’t even be cut without struggle. how bout, instead of giving us cutlery that is essentially only good enough to eat a sandwich with, give us cutlery strong enough to cut ts. idk! maybe, just an idea!! especially when u wanna serve hard and dry food. MIND U, i just ordered it and taobao, and ate it soon after, not ONE HOUR or a million years later, and it felt like i was eating last weeks leftovers as a brokie (except this was not a brokie priced meal). thanks for coming to my ted talk, in summary, it no longer is good and it sucks. even their service. k thanks bye.",
