Gator,4,"Simple street side stall selling home made muah chee. First time seeing this stall located right at the cross street in front of bierhaus.

It’s been sold by a foreign lady as she don’t really understand when I was speaking with her. Probably someone hire her to sell there. Anywhere the muah chee was soft and the peanuts generous. One packet for 5 ringgit seems reasonable.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
