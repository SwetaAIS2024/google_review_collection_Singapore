Adelia Tan,2,"5 Feb 2025, 12.30pm. 2.5 stars.

Happened to pass by this stall and the giant squid promotion caught my eye, so I decided to give it a try.

Staff was polite, attentive & quite friendly. Mobile payment apps & cash accepted only.

I requested for less salty, no chilli powder. Received my order in about 5 minutes after making payment even with 3-4 orders ahead of mine.

Size of the squid & promotion price $6.80 are acceptable. The coating was crispy enough but I didn't really like the texture/mouthfeel & it was quite thick, with most of the flavours came from the coating & seasoning powders (pepper salt & plum), the squid underneath the coating wasn't really seasoned.

Jamie T,3,Ordered the chicken cutlet. Portions are small for $6.80. Meat was very thin. Not even on the same level as Taiwanese cutlets.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102507017668627998303/reviews
Frisca Aliya,1,I bought the giant squid. I asked her to cut before fried and the lady at the counter said ok. Then the other lady handed it to me WITHOUT CUT the squid and its super big I can’t eat. I had to left because she was very RUDE,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112196618129020377241/reviews
