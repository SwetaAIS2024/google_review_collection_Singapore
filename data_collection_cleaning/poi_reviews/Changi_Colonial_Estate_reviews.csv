Forest BK,5,"There are quite a number of Colonial Houses at the Changi Colonial Estate.
A few of them are boarded up, presumably undergoing restoration work.
Most of the Colonial houses at Sealand Road, Halton Road, Biggin Hill Road, and Upavon Road seems to have residing residents.
The Changi Cottage, Changi Seafront Chalets, Changi Garden Chalet. Netheravon Terraces, Halton Road Chalets, Fairy Point Chalets, and Yacht Club Chalets are part of CSC @ Changi.
Most of these Colonial houses are for rental to the public.
A few are boutique hotels.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
