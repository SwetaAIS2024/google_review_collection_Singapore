Christabel Teo,4,"A simple industrial canteen with no fanciful food stalls/decor, but dining there was comfortable as it was super airy and cooling.

Tried for the 1st time the nasi Padang from Ziqri Muslim Food Corner and was pleasantly surprised by the flavours of every ingredient (black pepper chicken, fried egg, begedil). Will definitely visit there again!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108114714148929905292/reviews
