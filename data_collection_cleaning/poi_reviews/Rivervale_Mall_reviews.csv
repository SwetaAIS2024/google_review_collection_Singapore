Ram Reyes,5,Everything is here. We used to go here for groceries. There's NTUC Fairprice and also Sir Murugan Market (indian store supermarket) which can provide you almost all of necessities you needed at home. Also got varieties of foods in Food junction and a lot of stores to eat. Got 3 bakeries in ground floor and few clinics on 2nd. Almost whole 3rd floor is NTUC so it was considered as a big one.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115690427466639954662/reviews
