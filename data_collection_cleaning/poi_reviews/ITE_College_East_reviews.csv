clifford ogutu,5,I was really impressed by ITE college East. The college is well resourced with the best facilities to help the students achieve their dreams. The facility is really big with different courses for the students to choose from. Security around the facility is also top notch. It was a privilege to visit the college and see the good work that is happening there of transforming lives.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109754293789808614531/reviews
Javen,1,"when walked into the cvc there 2 staff at the main counter and both are extremely rude always.

the people working at the korean food stall at level 1 canteen are also rude. Always talking to customers in a rude tone. Even scolded me cos they couldn't see my queue no. on my receipt from where I was standing.

The toilets are poorly managed with broken toilet doors and the toilets smell so sweet.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118436250746253832118/reviews
jake,1,"Long straight hair big sized cvc staff who works at the ezlink area is really rude and condescending. Doesn't communicate with me and expects me to know what she wants me to do. she also has the cheek to tell me "" eh but (my course) cannot be so blur one""

Don't work customer service if you're short tempered and has no basic respect",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117749298546593286146/reviews
Ebenezer Heng,5,"Just did a sharing last week on Augmented Reality to a group of ITE East students. And I enjoyed the facilities in the learning lab (level 2).

It is spacious but not intimidating to participants (traditional lecture hall tends to discourage sharing and discussion).

Had a very lively discussion here.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114343992432708683027/reviews
