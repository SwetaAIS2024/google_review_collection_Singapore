Kai Hang,5,I would recommend this tuition centre as the teachers are dedicated and friendly. I'm a slow learner and they assign me in small group class and I benefitted from that tremendously. Thank you teachers for the hard work and effort!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108266466693238079269/reviews

Nick & Lynne,5,"My nieces have show great improvement to their grades after many years of hard work from Mrs Ng. However, to see bad review to insist tat Mrs Ng is being pushy is such a malicious comment. She has always been very pushy to the students to get good grades but never pushy to parents to sign the students up for any tuition courses. All tuition courses are intended for the good grades of our child. If we cannot bear to part with our money and/or time for the sake of our child, dun maliciously accuse others for being hard selling.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117096188502328442555/reviews
Peggy Teoh,5,"I'm not a very kiasu mother however when my child score only 70 plus for her subjects, I'm quite worried. Furthermore, fundamentals are very important for her to score better in the future thus I feel should let her go for tuition to build on her foundations. That's when I came across Shi Lin Learning Centre's crash courses. These crash courses really help my child on her foundations in her subjects and indeed she did improve during her exams. Thank you Shi Lin! Looking farward for crash course again ðŸ˜Š
