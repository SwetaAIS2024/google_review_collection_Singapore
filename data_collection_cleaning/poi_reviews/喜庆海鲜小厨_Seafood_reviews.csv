Savan,5,"The restaurant, just a 10-minute walk from home, is frequently visited. Their wok hey is good. The claypot beef brisket is delicious, but it would be even better with a bit more radish. The Ëù¶Ê£ó size seems smaller than before. The oyster omelette is still very tasty. The chilled crab is delicious, with fresh and juicy meat. Pairing it with mantou and Chill crab sauce is the perfect combination.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115757903290306503916/reviews

Yvonne Chew,5,"Their dishes have tasted better this year 2024. My kids love the crispy noodles and gravy hor fun. Love their curry fish head, bitter gourd fish head, fatty pork ribs, stir fried lala, salted egg prawn balls, homemade beancurd, and watercress soup.

In one of our visits previously, one of the dishes wasn't cooked properly. Their crew took our feedback constructively. Thereafter, the chef made a new one. So, I do appreciate their service and response.
I have noted some customers' reviews, and I must say they must try again when their boss and main chef are around. It is nicer. üòÜüòÜ",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108295127785662467332/reviews
V L,1,"Today fried noodle horrible,  yellow noodle still very raw and super oily, not cook at all. Usually foods is good. Eaten here many times. But today just shock me. Worst fried noodle, I had only one mouth. Will never never order fried yellow noodle again.
Maybe the restaurant, change new chef. Or maybe it is a last min sudden replacement chef. So you can try your luck here.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110598083917333012963/reviews
Justin Tan,3,"This was recommended from an Instagram feed. I had hiked 10 km and was feeling hungry. From Pasir Ris MRT station,  I walked for 15 mins to the food court. On the receipt,  it's printed Chef Tham. I ordered the medium portion for $11. I didn't wait for long. There was a slight wok hei which fits my palate. There were 3 prawns, snakehead fish fillet and pork. No offals. The gravy was a bit bland, and I had to pour the entire green chill and soy sauce. It's not truly outstanding.  Don't come here if you don't live nearby.  Ordered another bottle of Tiger beer for $7. Feeling blessed.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115739474329491912284/reviews
