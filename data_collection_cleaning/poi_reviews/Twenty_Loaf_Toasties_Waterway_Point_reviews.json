      "text": "I chose egg mayo thinking it will not go wrong since it’s a classic flavor. Eggs was not well seasoned. Unless they were hoping the pork floss sprinkles will help to replace the seasoning. The sweetness from pork floss did help a little but a pinch of salt will lift the overall flavor profile better. I don’t eat salty food but I expect some minimal seasoning. Bread was toasty and good portion of egg. Just fell short on seasoning.",

Even tho I got 2 of the $1.95 flavour.\n\nNot that I really care about the 25 cents discount. But it would be nice to be more transparent about the pricing w customers and not having to have to ask about it after toast has been heated and money is paid.\n\nReceipt wasn’t even given after payment.\n\nAlso, paying $2-$4 for a quarter of a sandwich was also pretty hefty imo.\n\nWill I be back probably not, but if you’re looking for a snack and a variety, it’d probably work",
