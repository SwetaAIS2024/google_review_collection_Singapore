Most importantly, he is also very skilled so i don't suffer the pain as i had from other dentists I've tried over the years. Recommended!",

Dr Loh\"s constantly checked that I was alright during the extraction, gave me much comfort and assurance.It was an awesome experience  since my wisdoms more than 15yrs ago. Dr Loh and his team was very professional and efficient with their dental services and follow up. A very well equipped clinic too. I would strongly recommend.",

      "text": "I am currently getting my dental implants here. My dentist is Dr Richard. When he started work on my teeth, he was careful to explain everything as he was working. And also to point out what were my options, nearly every step of the way. Dr Richard is very professional and extremely skilled at what he does. As I am shit scared of pain, something I may or may not have mentioned to him, he was constantly checking in on whether I'm ok, do I feel any pain. And sometimes I catch him humming or singing while at work. It's nice to see a dentist who does what he does so well and is able to sing a little while doing so, lol. I think it helps put nervous patients at ease and also makes you feel that your teeth are in the capable hands of someone who loves his job.",

      "text": "Just got done with my dental appointment and I would give zero stars if I could. I have visited this clinic for over ten years since I was young and this has tainted my whole experience with Q&M.\n\nHad my appointment today with Dr Sally Zhou. The filling, scaling, sand blast and polishing procedures were absolutely rushed out in 15 minutes. In the first 5 mins of sitting down and getting examined, I was recommended additional procedure after procedure, first a crown which I turned down and then an x-ray and tooth guard. It just felt pushy and like she didn’t care to understand how big of an impact these procedures could be for a patient.\n\nThe technician assisting Dr Sally was standoffish the whole time and didn’t even bother to speak in proper sentences. When she passed me the mirror, she just nudged it into or tapped my arm with it and said: “Hold the mirror”. She also wasn’t careful with the suction and was pressing quite painfully on my gum with one of the tools during the sand blasting. I get that it’s a clinic but there’s basic courtesy and respect to uphold as a person and she didn’t even bother to do that.\n\nDuring the filling process, the dentist understandably has to shave off the excess of the filling to help it fit, however I have not had a dentist shave down my opposing actual tooth to help the new filling fit. I understand that shaving too much of the filling might affect the structure but you don’t shave off actual teeth without asking and explaining why. Moreover, it was really sensitive when Dr Sally did so and it concerns me that it might lead to my other tooth being compromised in the future.\n\nThe scaling process was also highly rushed and there was no care nor concern showed for the sensitivity or pain caused. The dentists I’ve gone to before all check in before to let me know to raise my hand should the sensitivity be too much and check in during the process of scaling. Dr Sally did not do that. At most she checked in once during the whole appointment to ask if I was doing alright and it was after the scaling had already been done. I’ve never had my gums bleed this much before during previous scaling processes.\n\nThe sand blasting was also rushed through and she hit my lip twice and in the same spot despite there already being a guard and it hurt!\n\nThe polishing after that was also rushed through and it did not feel like it was done properly at all.\n\nOverall it was a horrible experience and I’m not the only one complaining about Dr Sally. Q&M has replied to previous reviews saying and I quote: ‘we will commence investigation and strive to improve our service in future’. The review and reply dated back to two years ago and it does not seem like anything has been done seeing that a similar issue occured a year ago and today.\n\nIt really calls to question if Q&M has actually done any investigations or if this is what they consider an improvement.\n\nI’m usually not one to write bad reviews but this is honestly highly concerning to me as it seems like a dentist who rushes through procedures, leading to unnecessary pain, has been allowed to continue conducting procedures as such despite issues having been pointed out by previous patients. To add on to that, patients pay a good amount and it costed me over $200 so I am highly disappointed.\n\nTo add on, it wasn’t just my procedures that were rushed through, my mum who went right after me for scaling and polishing had the same experience as well.\n\nI do look forward to a reply and hopefully not a copy pasted one which seemingly leads to no improvements being made. Thank you.",
