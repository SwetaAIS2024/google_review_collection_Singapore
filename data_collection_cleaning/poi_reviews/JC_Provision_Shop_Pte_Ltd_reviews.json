It barely has any snacks, Hershey's bar is $3.50, red bull is $99.99, and when you buy something, it will just drop it down violently. Once opened can of coke, explodes. Ribena cap damn hard to open. I literally had to use my teeth to open.\nDon't come here unless you want a unpleasant experience. Oh yeah, they took down one of the vending machines.",
