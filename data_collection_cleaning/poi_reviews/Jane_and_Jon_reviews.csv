Hui Yi Goh,5,"Only seen in photos are some of the awesome dishes prepared by Jane & Jon. They were super attentive to my dietary restrictions, adapting each dish specially for me, and every dish still tasted absolutely perfect! NOT seen in photos are the wonderful hosts, their cosy dining set up, and the meaningful conversations that we got to have - This was what made the dining experience so unforgettable for me. 15/10 would recommend this to anyone looking for a home dining experience. Do take note you’ll need to book early!!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104218481914878181122/reviews

Gareth Tan,5,"Have been on the waitlist to dine at Jane&Jon’s for the longest time and it was finally my turn! Brought my closet friends along to celebrate a special occasion at J&J’s and they accommodated to all our special requests! Their place is super cozy and I love the little antique touches that they have added to their place.

We had the cheese platter and mozzarella sticks for appetisers and they were so yummy!!

Beef ragout and grilled prawns for mains were cooked to perfection. Definitely will be back the moment they have available slots.

Till next time Jane and Jon!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114489634690353570594/reviews
