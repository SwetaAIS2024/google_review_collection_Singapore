Xoom Too,5,"The People‚Äôs Park Complex is a fairly simple mall located in the Chinatown area right next to the street food and an outdoor food court. The mall has a dollar store, massage stores, currency exchange stores, some food stores, electronic stores, clothing stores, shoe stores, and more. I‚Äôd say the food court and food stalls outside are more exciting to visit especially for a quicker visit but still you got some nice places in the mall.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105863133358477079886/reviews
Ÿ•‡°áŸ•,5,"There is hawker centre that sells authentic Chinese food. However, many aunties in this food centre can‚Äôt speak English. Feels like Hongkong. If you want to visit rooftop, go to 6 storey. You have to reach stairs in order to get to the rooftop. Floors are slippery so be careful.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111165278883772720382/reviews

m,5,"There are lots of street food shops outside and tech shops inside of the first floor. There are massage, nail, barber, tour shops and others on the second and third floors. The price of massage shops are cheaper than other places in Singapore. When you are tired of walking, it‚Äôs really a good place to recharge your energy.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105550892012784714702/reviews
Christine Bethea,5,"Suggested to us by a local living in the USA, we could not have had a better day of shopping and scouting. Bought scads of beautiful fashion from ‚ÄúIrene‚Äù on the 3rd level at reasonable prices, lots of fabric too for my quilts. We took the ERP to People‚Äôs Park Complex and you could almost eat off the floor on this National rail system. Just bear  in mind some stores don‚Äôt open early. We came at the suggested 10am time and had to wait a bit to get in the best shops, which opened  two hours later.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112114825047495065835/reviews
