V L,1,"Value for money meal and the pork leg rice was good.

I minus 3 stars for super bad attitude of the staff (plump dude) who was chopping the trotters. The black shirt guy in the pix.

Shouted at me to queue at the correct direction to the left (dude chill!) as there is only person in front of me ?

When I asked for a spare bowl, the plump dude shouted at me at the second time to collect in front on the Q on the right when I was on the left (the lanky stall assistant working behind him was very polite and tried to help me but he gotten stared down by the fatty) Relax lah bro ....",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104168013017365677219/reviews
Karen K,4,"Have eaten here 2-3 times already and the food quality all times are consistent. I enjoy their meesua which is unlike the traditional Taiwan meesua. They are very generous with the pork intestines as well and if you love garlic, youâ€™re gonna love the broth. We ordered the pork knuckles ($24, but pictured is just half portion because we ask to pack the other half home). Tender, generous portion again.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102882223208614112953/reviews
Jovin TSD,4,"Nice.

Trotter Leg was Nice.

I love the Iceburg Lettuce.

Salted Veg - not to my liking.

The large Intestine was good - No Smell as compared to others.

I do not mind eat again if I am back there.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107603874819828806450/reviews
Matthew Lee,2,"Amazing looking bowl of goodness simply failed to impress.

Pig's trotter could do with more time simmering on the stove with a different brand of quality soya sauce.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102172941439658597090/reviews
D Daphne,1,"The food is okay. But the staff attitude is a part MUST highlight ðŸ™‚.  The skinny staff with tattoo on the leg who talks in low voice and frustrated on customer who cannot listen to him. He also 'throwing' the food on the tray to customer. Wow such a fantastic service I ever had. ç™¾å¹´ please improve your staff a BASIC service training.
Good luck",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108703540951151420625/reviews
