The girl calling out the 9.30pm discount is so good, she put so much enthusiasm in the job lol\nWe love the Pais Rocher and fruity green tea\nSee photos.\nNot the cheapest place in town but lively, clean and can usually get a seat, something unusually in Singapore cafe society\nKeith and Dax\nPlease like this post if it was helpful üôèüèº",

The fresh cream on the cake enhances the taste of the strawberry. The young service crew members are energetic and friendly. Nice place for tea break.",
