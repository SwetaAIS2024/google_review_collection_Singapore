The management (old man and daughter) does not care about reviews/service and only profitability since they are a monopoly in the area. Avoid if you can because many residents have boycotted this Food Joy, unless you have no choice. Enough said, go shop at your own risk!",

Why are the prices not indicated as I could compare the price difference of certain brands and food. When I feedback this to the cashier who was a China girl and a foreign lady they kept quiet and didn't even reply me. One even showed her pissed off face to me. I'm the customer and was merely asking. Ridiculous customer service and in fact spoilt my morning mood. Put the bloody prices for the freezer items!",
