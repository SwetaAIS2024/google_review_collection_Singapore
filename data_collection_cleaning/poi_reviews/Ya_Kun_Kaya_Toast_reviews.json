National Day special durian toast is not bad.\n\nThere's always a crowd here, it is either crowded or very crowded. 2-4pm less crowd.",

Need it for a medical condition but didn’t feel I needed to divulge this. Insisted I pay for their overpriced bottled water.\n- their eggs were a little over-boiled (see photo)\n\nNearby, another Ya Kun at B2 of Vivocity is a lot more customer-friendly.\n\nSigh! Too bad.",
