      "text": "My mum had a swollen half face on the late morning of 29 Sept, Sunday due to a toothache the night before. However, as it was a Sunday, most of the dental clinics were closed and eventually I chanced upon Smile Design Dental which was opened on a Sunday. Moreover, there will more than 30 5stars positive reviews on Google Maps reviews which influenced my decision to call them up.\n\nThey were only opened for half a day on Sunday and when I called to enquire, it was already 12.30pm. I just called anyway to try my luck to see if they could accept last minute walk-in. Ms Jamie, who took my call told me they have a last patient for the day before they close but she will check with the doctor first. She called me back a minute later and said that they will attend to my mum. I was very relieved then.\n\nThank you very much to Dr Gordon Tam, Ms Jamie and their assistant for staying beyond their working hours on a Sunday just to attend to my mumâ€™s case. They are all very friendly and understanding. I will definitely recommend this clinic to my relatives and friends from hereon.",

Dr. Gordon, Dr. Goh, Jamie, and the staff are approachable and friendly.\n\nDr. Gordon will discuss with you what dental work is needed and explain thoroughly why it is necessary. He will also discuss pricing upfront so you don't have to worry about hidden charges. The clinic has great tools and equipment. Thank you, Dr. Gordon, for taking care of my dental health!",

I've always had a little \"dental-phobia\" each time I visit a dentist but Dr Charmaine proves to be a very caring dentist, checking in periodically and ensuring that I was comfortable throughout the session. Best dental experience thus far!\n\nShe patiently explained about the different options of teeth whitening and weighed in her opinion of each option objectively so that the patient is able to make an informed decision.\n\nI'm impressed++ with the dedication in her profession and highly recommend all to have Dr Charmaine Tan in charge of your dental health.",

      "text": "I have been seeing Dr Gordon for almost three years now and he is without a doubt the most professional, attentive dentist I've ever had. I used to have bad dental phobia but Dr Gordon takes time to explain everything he is doing and is very gentle in his technique. Cleanings with him are a breeze, and I even look forward to going to get scaling and polishing done every 6 months. I've also gotten wisdom tooth surgery from their oral surgeon and the recovery was amazing, I had virtually no pain during or after the procedure and was eating solid foods the day after the procedure. I've recommended so many people to go see Dr Gordon now. Additionally, his entire staff is nothing short of professional and kind. If you're scared of dentists or have had bad experiences with dentists in the past, this is the place to go.",
