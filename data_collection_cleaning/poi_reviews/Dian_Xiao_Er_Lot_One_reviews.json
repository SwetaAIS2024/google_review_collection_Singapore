      "text": "Paid S$134.53 for 4 persons dinner. The skin of the roast duck was crispy and the meat was tender and flavourful. The marmite chicken was tasty. The broth of the stewed pork ribs with yam and mushroom was flavourful too. But the pork ribs were slightly hard. The fatty char siew has a rich, savory, and sweet taste. The kang kong was ok. Service was friendly as the waitress explained patiently the benefits of being a member and how to place order in order to utilise the $10 discount voucher.",

      "text": "All these years, Dian Xiao Er remains a reliable choice, synonymous with its renowned herbal roast duck and Mongolian pork ribs. While the herbal roast duck lived up to its reputation during my recent visit to this outlet, the Mongolian pork ribs didn't quite reach the heights of past experiences. However, the Iberico char siew and Lei Cha Fan here proved to be delightful surprises instead. The staff here are extremely friendly and welcoming which makes for a great dining experience.",

      "text": "Minus one star for the dropping quality of rice.\n\nThe first time I tasted the rice years ago, it was superb. Every grain was perfect, and it was delicious in its own. Now, you could easily spot many broken grains, and that affected the overall texture. For a bowl of rice that cost almost $2, I expect better.\n\nThe other dishes were well done, including the side dishes, which were surprisingly tasty. The azhar was tangy yet spicy and sweet, and the crunch of the vegetables in the mouth made it hard not to go for more mouthfuls. The abalone mushroom was well marinated, and the side dishes were a steal if you go for the promotion.\n\nThe curry fish tail was welcome. Instead of the usual fish head, the meat of the fish tail was more delicate, and to make things better, there is a great reduction in the amount of bones. The sauce was rich while not overpowering, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves curry fish head.\n\nThe duck wings were a little too dry and chewy for my liking. While the char siew had a nice fats to meat ratio, the sauce was on the sweeter side, and it lacked the aroma of the typical charcoal grilled meat that one would expect.\n\nThe other dishes were great, and service was prompt too. Overall, this is a zi char place with a good standard for food.",
