@ Gunther

S$48 restaurant week menu

baguette was good üëç

smoked salmon with asparagus was good, salmon very lightly smoked, in-house

scallops on shell was big and plump, nicely done

pork shoulder quite tasty, texture not the best some tough bits. the shell pasta was good üëç

seems they ran out of prawns for YS, asked to replace with crab meat. pretty good dish

for dessert I selected cheese platter,  pretty standard

great lunch and wonderful dinner with friends

Aubree Ophelia,5,"We recently visited Gunther‚Äôs on a weekday evening for dinner, and we really loved the food. The ambience, service and quality of food made the entire dining experience enjoyable.

First, we were welcomed with warm bread and butter - simple yet so delicious we asked for more! The cold truffle pasta with caviar and king crab leg with tomato rice were eye opening for both us and our tastebuds, highly recommended!

Desserts also did not disappoint and our tummies were extremely pleased when we left. We‚Äôll be back!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112155242259007570287/reviews

Ally L,5,"The atmosphere was absolutely beautiful, complemented by mouth-watering food and an incredibly kind and polite service crew. They went out of their way to accommodate my preferences, and the chef did an outstanding job catering to my picky taste buds.

The only downside was a large birthday party in the event space, which slightly disrupted the ambiance. However, overall, it was a wonderful dining experience.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101143257946324941176/reviews
