      "text": "Be careful of the expiry date. Never encounter milk tin expiry in 6 months time. Bought on 21/03/2020 and the expiry date was on 30/09/2020. Lucky that my 3 years old daughter can tell us that she don't wan to drink her milk and want change to her younger sisters milk. She also say milk funny. Think the milk tin they keep too long and near to expiry date. In chinese we call it Lao hong. We go back to the shop and feedback that the milk is way to near the expiry date and our daughter rejected the milk. Please stop selling to others babies or kids. They might not tell the parents the milk is smelly. The lady in her early 50s and sound like a Vietnamese which we bought from her. Go aggressive in talking and so offensive. Told us cannot be change becos is open. ðŸ˜‚ Come on, we open n let our daughter drink than we will know right. She push to Nan and say contact Nan. After that my hubby ask her again. \"so you say contact Nan\"  she then say \"no I did not say that\". Come on talk nicely to people and ppl will understand. Dont talk in a v bad attitude to your customer la. We walking out the the shop and she continued to shout. ðŸ˜‚ People buy thing from u. Wow talk v nice to you. But ppl come feedback abt ur bad product. You fast fast taiji to Nan with a bad attitude. Think a solution for ur customer and show empathise to your costomer. But I confirm never ever buy things from her shop anymore. Will share to our friends, relative and family.  Be careful",
