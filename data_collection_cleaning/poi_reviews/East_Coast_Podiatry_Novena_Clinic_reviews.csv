Althea Ong,4,"I've been coming to this clinic for some time for heel pain. After the previous podiatrist left and I started seeing Mr Daniel, he really helped to work on my issue in a more holistic manner, targeting not just the symptom (heel pain) but other underlying/prominent issues relating to biomechanics. He is truly professional and sharp in his assessment of the reason for my heel pain, as well as in recommending appropriate exercises for me to do. He also recommended custom in-soles when he noticed that the standard ones I had were not providing my feet with enough support. It is evident that he genuinely cares about improving the condition of those who come by the clinic (hope he's not leaving!). Felicia and Jordan have also been nothing short of helpful in terms of guiding me in my rehab and therapy sessions. While my heels still hurt when I stand for longer periods of time, they are better than when I first started out at the clinic. Thank you ðŸ˜Š",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106464837081797427331/reviews

Sonali Gohil,5,"I recently had a toenail removal surgery performed by Dr. Jordan, and I couldnâ€™t be more pleased with the experience. From the start, Dr. Jordan took the time to explain the entire procedure clearly, which helped ease any anxiety I had. The surgery itself went smoothly and was handled with great care and professionalism.

The aftercare was excellent â€” Dr. Jordan ensured I knew exactly how to take care of the area and followed up to make sure everything was healing well. I also want to mention the reception staff â€” they were incredibly welcoming and made the whole visit feel comfortable from start to finish.

Highly recommend Dr. Jordan for anyone needing podiatric care!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117158669282728887677/reviews
