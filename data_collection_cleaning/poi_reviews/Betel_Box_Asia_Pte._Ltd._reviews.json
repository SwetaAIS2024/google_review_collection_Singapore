      "text": "Tony will go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable. They send you a brochure with lots of information about what to do in Singapore and how to move around.\nWe stayed in the 5 bed female dorm which was very spacious and lovely.\nThe shared bathrooms were clean and equipped with the basics.\nAlso, the commo area was huge and they even sell drinks. Last but not least, breakfast was basic but very handy in such an expensive country.\nEverything was pretty good. Some toilets on the third floor were tiny and I kept getting wet with the shower by mistake but it wasn't a big deal. Also, bear in mind that prices are usually high everywhere and although it was one of the cheapest options, still far more expensive than any other country in the area.",

      "text": "Great time, friendly staff, good level of amenities + cleanliness for the cost. Common area is perfect if you want to chat, also air conditioning at night was amazing. Very welcoming atmosphere, felt very safe and staff were very attentive to my friends and I. One very minor complaint- check in could be faster, but even then, didn’t take too long and we happened to come at a busy time. Awesome hostel, highly recommend.",

      "text": "Pros\n•\tAffordable – One of the cheapest options in Singapore.\n•\tFree breakfast – Basic (just bread and tea/coffee), but a nice perk.\n•\tFacilities – Has a fridge for guests to use.\n•\tConvenient location – Close to a FairPrice grocery store, a hawker center, laundry services, and a night market.\n\nCons\n•\tWiFi issues – You have to reconnect every day, and the process is very tedious. If you have multiple devices, you’ll need to do it for each one.\n•\tNo extra amenities – No towels provided, and you have to make your own bed.\n•\tLack of social atmosphere – Not many events or opportunities to meet people.\n•\tCramped facilities – The bathrooms are tiny, with the shower and toilet in the same stall, so the floor is always wet.\n•\tPoor bathroom conditions – No toiletries provided; the soap dispenser was filled with water, and there were no paper towels.\n•\tInconvenient location – About 45 minutes from most major attractions by public transportation.\n•\tNoisy at night – Quiet hours are not enforced. In my experience, a guest in the women’s dorm ate strong-smelling food and talked loudly on the phone in the bathroom, and the staff didn’t intervene.",

      "text": "Its a good hostel for that price. I stayed several nights in the same room, which was cleaned every day. There are lockers which are a little too small for a big travelling backpack, but you can def. store your most important things in there In general it was a very clean hostel. The location is ok. 15min walk to a MRT (subway) and several bus stops are close by. Would go there again.",
