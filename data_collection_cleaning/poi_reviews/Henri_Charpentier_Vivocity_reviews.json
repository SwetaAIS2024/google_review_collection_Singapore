The cheesecake is equally impressive, offering a decadent and satisfying experience.\nWhile the quality of the desserts is undeniable, be prepared for a slightly higher price point. However, for a special treat or a memorable dessert experience, Henri Charpentier is well worth the splurge.",

      "text": "We needed a tea break and Henri Charpentier is in the right spot for it. Henri Charpentier has always been a very good Bakery focusing on the cakes they do really well which is their shortcake and cheesecake.\n\nWe ordered the strawberry shortcake, mango shortcake and double cheese cake (all in slices) to try. My girls were slow eaters and I was surprised for the first time, they gobbled down the cakes. Not because they were hungry but they really loved the spongy cake and the light weight cream. We all enjoyed it.\n\nCompliments to the staff as well with good service and recommend better payment method for us.\n\nOnly downside is the limited seatings but when I was there, the place is not crowded so I could find a seat. A lot of customers opt for take away.",

      "text": "Visited this outlet on a Friday evening around 8:30pm and the place was empty.\n\nWe took a while to decide as it was my sister's and mother's first time. The lady manning the cake counter did not bother to ask or offer any assistance. In the end we opted for their limited time special Berry Blossom ($10.20) and their Double Cheese Cake ($8.70).\n\nWhen asked by the other staff how many forks I needed, I said 4. To my surprise they gave us plastic forks, in my other visits to their other outlets, they'll give a metal fork when dining-in. But I didn't question as it has been a while since I last visited, just thought it was a change in SOP.\n\nOn to the review of the cakes we ordered. The Berry Blossom was overtly sweet and sickening. The cake on the inside was dry and bland. The cheesecake was light and airy, a good mix of savory and sweet, but not too sweet.\n\nWhilst we were in the midst of eating, another group was about to leave, returning the tray to the tray collection point. As I was conveniently seated right by it, I noticed they were given metal forks. 2 ladies who walked in behind us ordered 1 cake and were also given metal forks.\n\nAs my partner was full from dinner, I returned the unused 4th fork that I took for him to the counter. Only to be met with the cake counter staff taking it and simply tossing it in the air in a somewhat rude manner. The fork hit the edge of the counter and fell to the floor. Whilst she violently hit the tray against the bin to show her displeasure.\n\nOverall, would not recommend anyone to purchase from this outlet. Both staff were extremely rude and treated us poorly, when we did nothing wrong and were cordial when ordering.",
