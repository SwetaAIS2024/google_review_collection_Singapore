      "text": "I had a fantastic experience at the Yamaha outlet in Westgate! The store is well-organized, with a wide range of musical instruments, books, and audio equipment on display. The staff were extremely knowledgeable and patient, answering all my questions and helping me try out several pianos before making a decision. I appreciated their genuine passion for music and their non-pushy approach. Whether youâ€™re a beginner or a seasoned musician, this outlet is a great place to explore quality Yamaha products with excellent service. Highly recommended!",

      "text": "Called to enquire about their piano courses. This is my second time calling with additional questions. The lady was really rude and dismissive.\nHad a really bad attitude like she didn't want to attend to my questions and kept rushing me, wanting to end the conversation like \" ugh. ðŸ™„ do you have anything else?\" type attitude.\nAnd even added some rude comments about my questions. What's so wrong about trying to clear my doubts before deciding to spend on a course? Why the attitude? I don't owe you anything. I'm just calling to enquire about the details of a service your company provides.",

However, it unilaterally brings forward one of its scheduled holidays and refuses to arrange for replacement classes. As a result, we pay the fees for the lessons on that day but do not get to attend any lessons.",
