Forest BK,5,"🐠Not to be confused with Bedok Jetty, Sungei Bedok Jetty is a recently completed double Jetty at the mouth of Sungei Bedok.
🐠The two parallel Jetty sit at both banks of the river with a bridge across it connecting the double Jetty.
🐠Anglers are seen at the end of the Jetty trying their luck.
🐠It's a great place to fish or simply to enjoy the sunset and sea breeze.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
