Cloâ€™s Laobu,5,"We had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant. The food was fresh, with a great variety of ingredients to choose from, and the broth was flavorful even after several top up on the soup. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. What I appreciated most was the peaceful atmosphereâ€”it wasnâ€™t overly crowded or noisy, allowing for a relaxing meal. If youâ€™re looking for a good steamboat place with great service and a quiet environment, this is definitely worth a visit! Overall it cost RM189 for this wonderful meal. Itâ€™s worth it. Will return again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114142484779850595642/reviews

Sow Chun Leong,5,"This is my 3rd time eating here. I can vouch for the chicken soup. In fact Ah Pei, a nice lady, recommended that we drink the soup first before we put ingredients into the hot pot. Needless to say, this time , we ordered 5 plates of pig stomach ðŸ˜‚.  So shiok.  Will be back end of June with more friends ðŸ’ª",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101214046367864810819/reviews
Henry Lai,1,"When I show this ""guo ba"" to the girl waiter. She said no problem all is like this and taste nice mix with rice.  But this dark rice is burnt smell, she said other place not like this but their shop all is like this and taste very good. Ask my family and I must try. As human sense this is unhealthy things so we don't eat. When we went out. I saw other table is not like this, feel ery disappointed with this service and feedback ðŸ˜”",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104644809140295346448/reviews
