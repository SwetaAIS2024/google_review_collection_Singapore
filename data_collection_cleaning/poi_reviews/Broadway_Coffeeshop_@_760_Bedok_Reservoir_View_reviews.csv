Kumar Kumar,5,"I recently visited this Broadway Coffee Shop. The Chicken Rice shop was great – the food tasted delicious and the staff were very friendly.

There are other stalls too, like the Wak Min Muslim stall and the Xiang Wei Braised Duck stall.

Overall, the coffee shop is very clean. HDB parking available.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105785160461687047440/reviews
alex burrett,5,Was a bit lost searching for a coffee in bedok reservoir area when I found this delightful place on a Sunday morning. Can’t go wrong with Nasi lemak (swapped chicken for tempeh) at $3.50 and iced coffee at $2.10- superb taste atmosphere and value and happily wasted a couple of hours here.

Supreet Kini,5,"Nice spacious coffee shop with quite a few eating options.

We tried the samosa chaat for $6 from Manasa La Tandoor. It wasn’t very warm, but it was good and satiated our Indian chaat cravings. Comes sprinkled with chana masala (chickpeas), sev and boondi.

We washed it down with Milo & Kopi-c. Good strong kopi.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105328280516267995599/reviews

Douglas Crane,2,"On 22 Dec 12pm a chinese-accented lady keep talking to the old lady doing cashier work at the beverage stall about her own personal annual leave issue. The cashier got distracted and cannot process customer requests smoothly. I looked at that lady and asked if they have finished, signalling dissatisfaction, but she continued anyways. I don’t understand what is so important that the lady must impair the stall’s function when customers are already standing there. She can quit her job if she doesn’t like it.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114837426429847210031/reviews
