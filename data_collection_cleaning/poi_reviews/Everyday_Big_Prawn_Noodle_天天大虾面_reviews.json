NOT CUT INTO HALF. Usually i get 1.5 prawns at this price with 3 halves thrown into my bowl, stuck to the shell. Not this stall üî• and they have a $3.50 Lean Pork Noodle Soup promotion!! Because their pork in my prawn noodle was tender, I would try this next time.\n\nRun by 2 approachable, friendly young people. I look forward to having prawn mee at this coffeeshop again! It has been a while and welcome change :)",
