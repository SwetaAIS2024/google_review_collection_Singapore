I’ve gained invaluable insights shared by the lecturers and my classmates. They are engaging, fun and interactive. The practicum centre that I was attached to, was an eye-opener for me as I get to experience working in a special needs school as a shadow teacher. It has given me great opportunity to continue working after graduating and expand my connections in the special education industry",
