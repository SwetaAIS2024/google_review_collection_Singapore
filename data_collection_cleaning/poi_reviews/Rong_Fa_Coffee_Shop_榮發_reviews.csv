Edwin S,5,"The coffee shop has various stalls, from Cai Png (mixed vegetable rice), tze char, Japanese Fusion mee pok, and some others.

I tried the dish from the Japanese Fusion mee pok (Li Yuan) stall. The mee pok was cooked to a good doneness, and their miso-based sauce gave the dish a unique savouriness, and their chilli gave the dish a bit of a kick. The toppings were very generous - with abalone, meatballs, fishball, minced meat, and the Japanese-style chashu, along with some lard. The soup is also very tasty.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113192406653516830642/reviews
Low Bao Heng,4,"The mixed veg rice in the coffeeshop is not bad. Price still okay.. just that had an unpleasant experience last Friday as the old uncle collected away my plate when I was drinking my oolong tea, he simply assume that my plate with about two small spoon of food left is unwanted. Too late even to stop him…😐",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108033403024309465290/reviews
TCH,5,"One can find 2 Northern Asians’ Cuisine here; one is a Japanese stall selling good Mee Pok noodles, but now he also has Japanese Fusion Noodles instead.

Another Famous stall is Ann Yeong Chicken selling Korean food by a Korean Man and his wife!

Both stalls one should expect some queuing and patience!

Another recommended local cuisine is the Indian stall serving a variety of Indian cuisines!

Good, cheap and tasty Economy Rice stall. My order 2 meat 2 veggie for $3.70. Generous with the scooping!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467592239988127131/reviews
Talya P,5,Actually just reviewing the pau shop. Cant believe this is the first! Because the liu sha paus in this coffeeshop are the BEST (better than restaurants imo). My partner and I buy them very regularly (at least thrice a week) because they’re so darn good. The dough is chewy and the salted egg yolk in it has the perfect consistency and taste > it OOZES out! The uncle actually went to Hong Kong to learn how to make dimsum. Do support uncle if you’re ever there!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113683185467614100232/reviews
Emily Ho,3,Indian food stall is good. Nasi goreng was spicy enough with lots of veggies too. Chicken murtabak was delicious; the prata wasn't too thick and was filled with lots of curry chicken. It came piping hot too.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106638367480970822498/reviews
