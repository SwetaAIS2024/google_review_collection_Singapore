Ng Wilson,5,"TLDR: one of the better prata places in Singapore and my favourite weekend breakfast stall.

I had many pratas, from those in Seletar to Springleaf to Bishan. This stall is one of the better ones out there that can easily make a name for itself.

Prata: the prata is bready and oily enough, giving it a very good balance between the feeling of 'full-ness' while not being overpowered by the oil. The plain prata is definitely a delight on its own and the egg prata makes it feel really rich in the middle of the prata. The slightly crispy exterior give it one of the best texture you can ask for in a prata and the prata tears apart with some force, showing how consistent the bread within it is.

Curry: their curry is absolutely a delight. The fish curry does not go into the spicy side, instead it is a good balance between sweet and salty, giving the prata and additional dimension of taste. Its closer to a slightly tangy umami taste than a meat based curry vibe, which suits really well to the prata they serve.

Definitely a must have if you are in this area.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102859395131102799796/reviews
Qiffy,5,Mutton Murtabak for dinner takeaway was nice although there was a little too much oil and pepper.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101757239719985625067/reviews
Nana Sim,5,"One of the best prata & tosei in Punggol .. esp if u r fish curry hantu. Get the prata banjir w fish curry. Roti john also nice. Murtabak also nice. Chicken masala biryani lagi nice. Love the fragrant rice. They made ur order of prata n tosei fresh upon order so waiting time is there. U not patient, dun patronise. And this is just a coffee shop stall so don't expect 5star restaurant service like i read in the other reviews. They are always packed on weekends morning esp w delivery orders but no regret waiting a bit for ur breakfast prata i tell you.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116997395046644178291/reviews
Aslan Artz,1,Too more than 1 hour to prepare 4 pratas. Can never be lousier.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106442851911037553730/reviews
Jp,1,Terrible place to go. Food prepare slow. Unhygienic. Hand touching everywhere collecting money and giving change. and never wash hands and prepare food. Even use hands to grab the food which drop on the table and put back to the plate then serve to customer. Eat at own risk. Dirty and disgusting shop.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111869634793624386632/reviews
