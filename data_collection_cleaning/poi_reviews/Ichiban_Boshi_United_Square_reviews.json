      "text": "This popular Japanese restaurant offers reasonably fresh sashimi, making it a solid choice for Japanese cuisine lovers. However, the Salmon Kabuto Shioyaki was overly burnt (as seen in the photo), though they promptly replaced it with another, which was appreciated. The refillable green tea was a nice touch, and the service was not bad overall. A decent dining experience with room for slight improvements.",
