Access to all levels via escalators or lifts with modern facilities.\n\nThe \"Tampinesians\" are very lucky and it was pretty crowded on the Sunday I was there and looks like it is widely used and popular.",

      "text": "Previously, I encountered a rude staff not letting me prepare a milk bottle at the entrance thinking I bring my toddler to the library to feed him. I did not manage to take my son to the library to introduce him books.\n\nToday, my husband and I attempted to introduce him to library and books but before we get to the lift, my son took interest in the exhibition. So he explored but a security guard was upset by the fact that I was pushing a pram. He assumed that I'm pushing the pram through the exhibition when I was simply standing as a corner, replying messages.\n\nTampines Library is the worst (sadly it is in my neighborhood) and please don't advocate introducing books or reading to children when your staff is not at all aligned to this principle.",

Though u have to walk quite the distance to drop your books off.\n\nIn addition, there are great sceneries due to the glass panels that allows you to see the main road and the stadium in the hub.\n\nLast but not least, there are many private corners where u can read in peace. Loved such intimacy ðŸ˜‚",
