Alex Guerresi,5,"I visited Singapore in April this year and had an exceptional experience at this hotel. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the room itself provided a sense of luxury. The staff were remarkably polite and kind, and the breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of delicious foods.

The rooftop pool was simply perfect, I had swum there every day. Additionally, the service was outstanding, even the location was perfect as well.

I would like to express my gratitude for my time here and recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Singapore. It is truly an ideal place to stay.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107728326419044220226/reviews
Tan Kwang Wei,5,"Booked this hotel for our wedding and we absolutely adore the experience here. Vanessa, Vik, Jasmine and the whole team were all very professional and catered to all our needs even though we had a minor change to our guest list at the eleventh hour.

The food served was fabulous and praised by our family and friends. The chefs took our comments during the food tasting and ensured that the food is cooked according to the comments and the standard of the food is consistent throughout.

The ballroom is really nice and everything from the decoration to the audio video system was on point and the ground staff were really very helpful to our guest too.

Everything and every experience that we had here was amazing and we were both glad that we decided to have our wedding at Holiday Inn Orchard City Centre. We couldn’t ask for more even if we wanted to.

Greatly appreciate the whole team for their exceptional service and assistance during the whole course of our wedding.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116527717537516074889/reviews
Tamara Reed,5,"Such a great hotel as a family of four. Staff were amazing from check in till check out. Was acknowledged for being a ihg member and was given a room upgrade which was amazing for our anniversary. We were also surprised with a yummy desert for our anniversary. Breakfast had a decent variety, however can be very busy. The pool was a big hit for my 6 year old. Location was great. After ending our Europe trip in Singapore, it was nice to sleep on such a comfortable mattress. 100% would stay again.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102387075802003003732/reviews
Arjun Anil,5,"From the moment I arrived, the service at Holiday Inn Singapore was top-notch. The staff were warm, welcoming, and incredibly attentive to every detail. The room was modern, spotless, and well-equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay.

DOC Football Academy,5,"DOC Football Academy recently toured Singapore and we stayed at the Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre. To say we were happy with the hotel is an understatement as it was a truly fantastic experience. The rooms were excellent and spotless and the staff were so professional, friendly and helpful. Staying at this hotel made our trip. If you are planning a trip to Singapore do yourself a big favour and stay at this hotel, I promise you that you will not regret it. The location is terrific as its so close to everything and the staff are something else. We are doing another tour in 2026 and we will definitely be staying at this wonderful hotel.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111564070844707232006/reviews
