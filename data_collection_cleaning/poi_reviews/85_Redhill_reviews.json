The hawker stalls are well-regarded, with many offering flavorful, hearty dishes. It can get busy, but the vibrant atmosphere adds to the experience. A great place to enjoy a variety of local favorites!",

      "text": "This is a good meepok fishball noodle. You will love the fishcake. I would say that they have a chance to be GREAT, with just 1 change.\nThe noodle is relatively taut, I wish it could be tauter--so that it has a nice bite. No, it's not soft and lumpy, no, it still has a nice bite.\nThe soup is great, it has a hint of Tang Chye (Preserved salted vegetable). IMHO, I think this is the key flavoring ingredient, started from the very beginning--50 years ago, eversince I was a kid.\nI love the fishcake, it is firm with a nice tautness in the mouth, and a very normal fish flavour. Some fishcakes are... smell-less, yeah it sounds weird, but it is true, because it has not enough fish in it? Too much flour?\nThe chilli paste to noodle ratio is perfect. It has a nice flavourful mix where every bite is so satisfying. I would say it leans to the sweet side, because it lacks vinegar.\nThe biggest weakness is the fishball; it is too soft, it feels like it is made largely of flour, not enough firm fish meat. I think these fishballs are factory made, not handmade by them. When you bite into it, it feels light and soft. So this costs them 1 Star in this review.\nI would go back to eat, if I happen to be in Novena. If you are there, please check them out. Add additional fish cake to your meepok.",
