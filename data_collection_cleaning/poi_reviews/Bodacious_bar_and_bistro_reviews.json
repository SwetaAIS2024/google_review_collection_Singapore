      "text": "Nice & chill atmosphere with a variety of mouth-watering food options!! Not many people on a weekday night but the vibes were still great with friendly staff :) Was craving chilli crab and was elated to see that they have chilli crab pasta ($24) on the menu! Tasty and spicy chilli crab sauce with juicy clam and prawns, didn't disappoint at all üòã would have liked to have a bit more ingredients in the pasta though~\n\nAlso tried the crispy snapper burger ($20), the fish was soft and the buttered buns were even softer! Came with a side of crispy and fragrant truffle fries too, loved it!\n\nHad a hourly happy hour deal going on, got a delicious draught black cab pint for $6.99 üëçüèª",
