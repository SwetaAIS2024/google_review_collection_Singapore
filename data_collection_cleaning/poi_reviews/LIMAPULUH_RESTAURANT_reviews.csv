Mark Tan,4,"Nice quiet place with enchanting lights beckoning you to go in. The service is fast and polite. The tea served is very thick and comes in a large portion üëç Food wise, can be improved. The chicken I had as shown in the picture was hard and dry that I have to ask for extra gravy to wash it down. Mayb the chef shd know that chicken breast meat are not suitable for deep frying as they tend to get dry and tough. But if you are there just for drinks, this is a nice place to hang out and have quiet conversations.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104102481118215309528/reviews

Mommy Umar,5,"Freshly made food, nice classic, homey, Malay ambience and music.

Nasi with asam pedas ayam - 10/10. Juicy and really flavorful asam pedas. Loved it!

Kiddy meals
Spaghetti carbonara - 10/10. My picky eater daughter loved it, even ate the chicken fingers although she normally rejected chicken or any meat. The handmade chicken fingers were really good (I tried some).

Nasi goreng cina - 10/10. Great portion and tasty. Came with the yummy chicken fingers and keropok. Very filling for kids.

Waiting time around 15 mins. Staffs are friedly.

Would really recommend this place as the quality and portion are really worth it. Keep up the good work!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103666954645096019361/reviews
