      "text": "Ordered hokkien mee, char kway teow and white carrot cake to try.\n\nHokkien mee was the worst out of the 3. No flavor, just tasted like salt and the noodles were burnt. There’s a difference between burnt and wok hei and this felt like the stock was burnt. On top of that the prawns were so minuscule, one of the smallest I’ve seen ordering hokkien mee across this island.\n\nSecondly the char kway teow was average, nothing of note and was totally forgettable.\n\nCarrot cake was weird as they do not provide any spring onions, I cut them and put them myself at home. It was ok but honestly tasted bland. Was average at best cause at least still can eat.\n\nHokkien mee is 1/5\nCKT 2/5\nCarrot cake 3/5\n\nAlso while I appreciate they cook upon order, the waiting time is too long. There was no queue and they started making my order when I ordered but I waited for a good 20 mins. What happens if when there’s like 5 ahead of me? Can’t imagine that.\n\nSlow service, pricey and below average food, doubt I’ll patronize again.",

      "text": "The food here is outrageously overpriced, and if I could give it a negative rating, I'd easily give it a -5 stars. The Hokkien Mee lacked any prawn flavor, tasting more like plain starch. The Char Kway Teow was far from authentic, with more of a burnt smell than the signature \"wok hei\" flavor, and the noodles were cut too short during frying—clearly a lack of skill. The carrot cake was stale and flavorless. I honestly don't understand how a franchise like this is still in business, especially when they charge at least $6 for a small plate of Char Kway Teow. It's a real shame!",
