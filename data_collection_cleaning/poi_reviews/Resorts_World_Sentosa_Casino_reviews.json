After filling some personal information, it take 5 mins to finish which was quick.\n\nNow I could enter the poker area, blind are 5/10 or 10/20 ... but because no one  played with blinds 5/10 so I joined the 10/20$ table. It was 14h30 and there was only 2 tables open (total 4 tables).\n\nI played until 8 PM and there were only 3 tables open. Maybe it was in week day so not much peoples could participate.\n\nIt was fun, even blind is quite big for me. If they have more variable of blind (1/2$, 2/3$ ...) it may attract more peoples. Players were also nice, I did had some chit/chat and they were open to discuss hands.\n\nI will def return when I come back to Singapore.",
