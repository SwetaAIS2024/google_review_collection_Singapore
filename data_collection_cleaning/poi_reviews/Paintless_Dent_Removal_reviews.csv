Terry Chia,5,A small shop at the corner of the block. Very experienced guy. Winston will take a look at the damage and give his opinion and how much he can recover. He also explained in detail how he is going to do it. And if I am acceptable with his explanation and price then he will start working on it. A true master of his craft with decades of experience in doing this. Definitely my go-to place for PDR in future. Highly recommended.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109564016558274256544/reviews
