She definitely needs a raise for how she is doing here job. Not forgetting Dr David. He been so tentative.  Listened to my problems and helped me so much.",

My uncle is a severe stroke patient and is currently NUH, yet he gave a diagnosis of my uncle being able to go home without even physically evaluating or seeing him before.This is extremely shocking to hear, especially with the ethics of being a medical professional. We will follow up and report this unethical doctor to the Singapore Medical Council.",
