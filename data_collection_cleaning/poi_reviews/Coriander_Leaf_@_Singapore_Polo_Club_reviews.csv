Jo K.,5,"We enjoyed dinner on Mother’s Day very much. From the surprise of a bouquet of orange roses to the mothers to the interesting appetizer One Bite to the mains (generous vegetarian menu!!) and the desserts (the creative crème brûlée in three flavours was exquisite: green tea, miso and black sesame).
Also appreciated the lovely service very much!

We sat inside, it was too humid. But would be nice to sit out on a cooler day especially if there were horses out practicing.

Ample parking and relatively access for elderly with walking issues.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106223395921756091650/reviews
Shannon (Shann),3,The food were ok. The ginger dessert taste shocked both of us. We find that abit too chemical like for our liking. We love the garlic naan. A tad disappointed too since we thought we will get to see horses but was told only on the morning and evening - we were there for lunch.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112175057717664262742/reviews
Kevin Ang,4,"A wonderful first experience at this much touted establishment with a large group of friends. Food was exquisite, full of flavours and spices that spoke of the chef’s imagination and thought put into them. Atmosphere was excellent set in the Polo Club. The only slight downside was being charged $100 (incl taxes) for 7 bottles of water, which a member of the party thought was complimentary when asked by the server “still or sparkling water?” As always, communication on both sides could have brought about more clarity that would result in a total positive experience rather than a “this place was great but…” taste in the mouth.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247294128726535324/reviews
Marc Ha,5,"Always been a fan of Coriander Leaf but first time to this outlet. Fabulous ambience with options for indoor (air conditioned) seating or alfresco dining. Even on a balmy May night, the alfresco area seemed cool enough,  helped by the ceiling fans.

Needless to say, the food is excellent. We had the garlic naan, olive fried rice, chargrilled broccoli, spinach parcel, grilled paneer, and curry prawns.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116047651430201692498/reviews
