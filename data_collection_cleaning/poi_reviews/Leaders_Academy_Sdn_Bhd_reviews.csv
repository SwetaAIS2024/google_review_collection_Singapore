Kyla Kim,5,"I am very pleased with my son's first experience at Leaders through his winter camp. I was worried since my son does not enjoy learning English that much but I had hoped that this camp would provide an opportunity for him to experience that English could be fun too. Leaders delivered on such promise and for that I am greateful. Everyone at Leaders, including even the staff was  very engaging with students and the principal always had such energetic vibe which was reassuring to see because I could tell that she really liked kids. My son seemed to enjoy being exposed to using English at Leaders. I am definitely willing to come back here if possible!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113205925664738319898/reviews
