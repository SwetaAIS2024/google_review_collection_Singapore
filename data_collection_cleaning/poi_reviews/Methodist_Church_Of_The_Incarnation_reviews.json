      "text": "What do you think of this church?\nHere's my truthful experience:\nI served there for close to 20 years. Spearheaded in numerous events and made so much improvements.\n\nOne day, I requested the chairman to bring an important matter up to the church committee. Knowing his lay-back attitude, I reminded him a few times over two months. Deadline came two months later, he said he had forgotten. I shouted and scolded him for being irresponsible. The week after, he did what I requested and I got my answer but it was all too late as the deadline was over.\n\nThe Assistant Pastor did not investigate or hear my side of the story, he removed my position as a prayer leader behind my back. I found out 6 months later! They did not provide any correction or counselling! The hurt was so tremendous that I left the church!\n\nOne year later the Pastor-in-charge called up to say that the Assistant Pastor had covered up the whole incident and he only realised my absence one year later! He arranged for a mediation but apologies from the leaders and Assistant Pastor were half-baked. There was no follow up after the mediation! I removed my membership!\n\nI sank into depression and two years later I wrote to the church district superintendent. They were not aware of the incident and they helped to conduct another mediation.  They promised to help and asked me to contact another pastor for counselling. I emailed him to make an appointment. After a few correspondences to find a suitable date, he did not follow up. I waited for close to 6 months!  I emailed him to ask why I have to wait so long and immediately he said he was free the next day! Do you think I should attend a counselling session with an insincere pastor?\n\nSo what's your view of this church?\nAre the leaders and pastors caring and loving such that they strengthen your faith?",
