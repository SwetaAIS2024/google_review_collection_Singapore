      "text": "Stumbled upon this cozy spot and it turned out to be a real hidden gem! The swing table added such a fun and unique touch—definitely a hit with the kids. The kid’s meal was well-portioned and delicious, and judging from the happy giggles and clean plate, it was a winner.\n\nTried the fusion pasta and a couple of western dishes—everything was hearty, flavourful, and comforting. Great for both adults and little ones.\n\nThe gelato and waffle combo was absolutely divine. Warm, fluffy waffles paired with rich, creamy gelato—just perfect.",

They even have a unique swing table as well, my little's one love it so much~\n\nIf you are a tomyum lover's, recommend their tomyum cream for you, the fragrance of the spice and chewy spaghetti with blue swimmer crab meat, prawns, white clams and squid.\n\nTheir fried chicken was tender and savoury with waffles is good. Last, ended our meal with waffle chocolate :)",
