JM V,5,"Before our 3 AM flight to the Philippines, my wife and I found Hong Kong Sheng Kee Noodle House in Terminal 4 at Changi Airport around 1 AM. We both ordered the HK Braised Beef Brisket Noodles in soup, and it was a fantastic choice. The dish was served piping hot, the beef was incredibly tender, and the flavors were spot on. It was the perfect comforting meal before a long flight, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended for travelers passing through Terminal 4!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113607140413131397124/reviews
Builds World,1,"I ordered the braised pork rib noodle — the noodles were fine, but the pork rib was tough, hard to chew, and tasted completely different from what I had before. It felt like they used a different type of pork rib and the way it was cooked just wasn’t the same. Really disappointing compared to my previous orders.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103895080144556041174/reviews
Maninder Saini,4,"Was hungry during transit and saw the Stall 1 for Hong Kong noodles. Noodle soup was good.
Got it within 5-7 minutes of ordering despite being busy lunch hour.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113692663406423422860/reviews
kent yew,4,"Nearly midnight transit on T4 .
Hot Wan ton noodles soup warm your heart, only order machine not really friendly using if u made more options, better just simply tap what u want & paid .
Base on the night hours, only one men show on this store . But tasty and keep standard . S$9.50 was reasonable.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104481944269786485768/reviews
Flo Yeow,2,"Only if you have a specific craving, or if you're desperate for something to eat; this will be an alright spot.

Spent about 13SGD for a bowl of mala wanton noodles soup, with extra lettuce, and luncheon meat. Wanton is edible (but feels like frozen CP wantons); lettuce is tasteless and super small in portion; mala soup is just weird-tasting with the taste of the noodles seeping into the mala soup without any umami.

Saving grace for them was the signature chilli sauce that they have on the side for free, with the green pickled chilli slices. Or else, everything doesn't have taste whatsoever.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
