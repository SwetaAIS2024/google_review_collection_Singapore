RCSC,3,"I had this take away. While it was a nice basic soup, i think there is nothing more special to it. Maybe I need to eat it at the food court.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101381356185028377091/reviews
CHILLI CHILL,5,"The peeled chilli chicken soup is definitely the star of the show.

There is so much complexity and depth to this dish & unlike any other soups I've tried. Sweet, savoury, umami, and a little spicy.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100539210691864172459/reviews

Jerald Lim,3,"Very nourishing peeled chilli soup, but the chicken pieces were burnt (could be due to reheating in a small pot) and dry. Worth a try if around the area.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101913444524439383194/reviews
Terrick W.,3,"We visited Qin Tang at Food Dynasty Cenileisure lately. Tried their Pepper Bakuteh and Braised Pork Rice. Soup is a bit too heavy for us, a bit too much of pepper. Pork ribs not soft enough. We like their Braised Pork Rice. We like their nice environment too.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117988793492560252192/reviews
