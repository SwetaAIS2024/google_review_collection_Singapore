Francesca Arianna,5,"My MUA, Aunn, assisted by Klar made my literal dreams come through! I felt like the most beautiful girl on my wedding day thanks to them. Aunn really came through with my vision for my wedding day look. She made my skin glow and worked to make my features stand out in all the right ways. She was also so easy to feedback to and worked tirelessly with an amazing work ethic to take notes and revision what would make the look better! I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better make up artist.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112122471141005904082/reviews
Christine H,5,"Shu Zhen did a great job with my wedding hair and makeup, as well as the groom's makeover. She made sure I was happy with all the details and was happy to tweak things here and there when requested. She's also a great conversationalist and talking to her helped distract me from wedding nerves. Thank you!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105366780430810291660/reviews

SzeWen Soh,5,"i chanced upon canvaseety when i was looking for my wedding MUA, and was so impressed by shuzhen‚Äôs natural and simple makeovers that accentuated the features of her brides rather than overpowered them.

as a person who did not prefer to wear makeup on a daily basis, i knew i had to engage her to be my MUA and it certainly did not disappoint!

i trusted her 100% during the trial and the actual day, and did not regret it! everyone said the makeup was perfect and made me look so natural yet beautified my features. she was also so willing to adjust anything we needed, not just the makeup but also our ever-changing timelines. i‚Äôm really so so thankful to shuzhen for being the best and making me feel so comfortable and safe with her! ü•∫üíï

best MUA ever! thank you so so much shuzhen ü´∂üèºü•∞",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101753038229388566636/reviews
Heather Jane Phua,5,"Saw a close friend engage Canvaseety for her AD wedding makeup and was so impressed I knew I had to engage them ASAP when the time came for me and my fiance to do our PWS! Shu Zhen, the founder of Canvaseety, was the one who did my pre-wedding photoshoot makeup. As a recent bride herself, she really knew how to allay all my wedding jitters and we ended up having such a great time together that the entire makeup process flew by so quickly!

Shu's comforting presence, makeup skillset and eye for detail really made me feel so beautiful and confident during my PWS. We didn't have a makeup trial previously so it was really all trust, her expertise, and good vibes but she colour matched me so well and really knew how to bring out my best! Canvaseety has some of the best wedding makeup artists in Singapore, and I can vouch from the bottom of my heart that every bride is in good hands with them! Thank you so much Shu Zhen & team at Canvaseety!!!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112688044726699848045/reviews
