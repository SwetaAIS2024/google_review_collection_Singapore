      "text": "I highly recommend it if you come to live in Johor Bahru for a month! If you have children, just stop by and play. Instead of just teaching classes like regular language schools, we offer cooking classes and science classes in English, so the children's satisfaction is the highest. There is a Songhat and a cafe downstairs, and there are many local restaurants nearby, so it's great for snacks and meals! We provide a variety of programs for students from ages 5 to middle school, and if you want, we can help you tour international schools. Surprisingly, many Koreans attend international schools in Johor.  There are many language schools in Johor Bahru, but there is none like this. The director is so nice..! Thank you for such a great vacation^^",
