Eng Kiat Poh,5,"This store is all about good taste old school style Chinese food. Highly recommended as it is difficult to find such authentic taste.

Good job to the crew",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112160727471762883305/reviews
Goh Donald,4,"Bustling in the morning, Prata not bad for a coffeeshop, gravy pretty tasty. Fast and freshly made! Love it! Parking right in front of coffeeshop, many lots. quick stop over meals for drivers! Kopi O quality and taste is way better than most coffeeshop, and standard is consistent. The economic beehoon stall 'Good Morning' gets long queue. nothing big deal the spread, but i mus say its great tasting and the old aunty cooks the noodle and ingredients fresh till sold out and cooks again. Assure hot and fresh!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109017869526721180156/reviews
