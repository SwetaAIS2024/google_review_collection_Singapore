Amita Raj-Bauer,1,"Unfortunately, I have to give this clinic a 1-star review despite the fantastic service and environment. I was recommended to Osler by a PT at my gym and had heard great things about the doctors' approach‚Äîfocusing on real solutions rather than just prescribing meds and sending patients on their way.

Before coming to Osler in February last year, I had already seen multiple doctors, specialists, TCM practitioners, and osteopaths‚Äîsearching for relief from severe PMS/PMDD. I was desperate for a solution that didn‚Äôt involve birth control. But to my disappointment, that‚Äôs exactly what I was prescribed here. Trusting the clinic‚Äôs reputation, I followed the advice, only to spend six months dealing with side effects that made things worse. I stopped the pill in July, but even now‚Äîseven months later‚Äîmy cycle is still unbalanced, and I‚Äôm still struggling with symptoms - the old and the new ü´†

Despite paying over $1,000+ for my visit, no tests were done to properly diagnose whether I have PMS or PMDD. Instead, I was sent generic WebMD articles (which I could have found myself) and told to read up on contraceptive options like the pill or IUD. When I reached out about the new symptoms that emerged after stopping the pill, the doctor‚Äôs response lacked empathy and accountability. I was simply told to come in for a ""check-up""‚Äîwhich, of course, would cost me even more.

If anyone reading this has gone through something similar and found a real solution, I‚Äôd truly appreciate any advice.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107614178964763802288/reviews

Hannah La Rue,5,"Always outstanding. Considerate, thorough, knowledgable and so reassuring. It‚Äôs always daunting being unwell far from home as an expat, but I receive better care at Osler than I would back home. Incredibly reassuring and reliable.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827003647019880734/reviews
Helen Nash,5,"As a health professional it is so important to me to have a GP surgery who I can trust and a GP who will be honest with me. I can honestly say that this is the best practice I have ever been part of. Each Dr that I have seen or met treats me as I would like to be treated. I feel seen and heard. There is no over referring and I feel looked after.
I would particularly like to give a big shout out to Louise. Louise is the first person you see at the desk. She is bubbly, kind and compassionate. She deals with difficult patients with ease and she makes the best coffee üòâ
From the front desk to the nurses and drs they really are a great team!
No I‚Äôm not on commission with them. Just praise where praise is due. Thank you Oslerüôèüèº",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100276158321323189583/reviews
Jill Hall,5,"Very impressed by Ostler Health. Needed to see a doctor while visiting Singapore and was extremely happy with the quality of the consultation. In addition, when I needed a repeat prescription, for delivery to Australia this was all managed very efficiently by extremely helpful staff. Highly recommend Ostler if you have any medical issues In Singapore.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112188000567322584317/reviews
