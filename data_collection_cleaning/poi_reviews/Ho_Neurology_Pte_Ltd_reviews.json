      "text": "I can't say enough good things about Dr. Ho.He is incredibly sharp, thorough, and kind, with a great sense of humor that makes even tough appointments easier. When I was at my worst—so sick I could barely get out of bed—he provided the care and support I needed. Thanks to him, I now live a fuller life despite the challenges of a chronic illness. Living with a long-term condition is never easy, but having a doctor who truly listens and supports you makes all the difference. I highly recommend him to anyone in need of a skilled and compassionate neurologist!",

      "text": "I have brought my father to see Dr. Ho in the past and know him to be a very good and experienced neurologist. When my wife developed some neurological symptoms last week, I know that Prof Ho would be able to sort it out for us. He was patient and very meticulous with his clinical examination, picking up very subtle weaknesses of her right hand and leg. His instructions\nwere very clear and my wife was sent for a CT scan. With the result, he gave us a detailed explanation of the cause of the problem and the treatment required. We went immediately to the emergency Department for further treatment.\nHis staff was efficient and helped us immediately with the arrangement of the CT scan. Thank you staff.\nI definitely recommend Dr. Ho to anyone who may have a neurological problem.\nYour help is fully appreciated Dr. Ho.",
