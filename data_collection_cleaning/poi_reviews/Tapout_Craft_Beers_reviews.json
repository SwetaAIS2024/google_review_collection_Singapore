      "text": "TapOut Craft Beer ‚Äì Great Vibes, Bold Flavours & A Smooth Surprise!\n\nAs someone who doesn‚Äôt usually drink, I was pleasantly surprised by TapOut‚Äôs craft beer selection, especially ‚ÄúFalse Sense of Security‚Äù, a fruity, smooth, and easy-to-drink beer that even non-drinkers like me can enjoy. It‚Äôs light, refreshing, and a great intro to craft beer. I‚Äôll definitely be trying more beers in the future!\n\nThe food is equally satisfying. The trio beef patty burger is hearty and perfect for sharing with friends. The skewers are well-seasoned, the fried cauliflower is a must-try, and portions are generous. Only minor note, the fish and chips batter was a bit salty for me, but that didn‚Äôt take away from the overall experience.\n\nWith its chill atmosphere and solid menu, TapOut is a great spot to hang out, eat well, and explore the world of craft beer, whether you‚Äôre a regular or just getting started.",
