I'm thankful for the considerate teachers and Ms Jennie for taking such good care of our child. They were responsive to enquiries on the app, and were regular with their weekly updates on activities. Our kid doesn't like to smile often, but very quickly came to enjoy the learnings and activities with the teachers",

Teachers are very professional, and enable students to have fun while learning, including hands-on experiments to spark their curiosity, cultural activities like calligraphy and festival celebrations to nurture their love for language and culture, and charity projects to nurture children's empathy. On top of that, my child has been dearly loved by all of her teachers, who would braid her hair after their naps and shower her with positive comments to reinforce good habits and mindset. We are very thankful that the school has prepared her well for the transition into P1.",
