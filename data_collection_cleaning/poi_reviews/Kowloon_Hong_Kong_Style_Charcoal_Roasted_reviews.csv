Kimes,5,"What a hidden gem! Love the texture of the noodles, the sauce and the meats have a right balance of fats!!! Portion of the meat was so much that i finsihed the noodles first.

CC Tan,1,"Paid for extra char siew but 60% of it was fat, hardly any lean meat. Serving portion also consider quite small at this pricing coming from hdb coffee shop stall. Taste wise nothing extraordinary. Will not buy from the stall again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108253037557626750334/reviews
