Had the cottage pie and yuzu coffee. Cottage pie was tasty, savoured up till the last bite and yuzu coffee was really well balanced with just enough acidity. Came with my husband and total for 2 mains and 2 drinks came up to only $42!!",

      "text": "Food:\nThe cafe serves mostly western cuisine such as Large Big Breakfast, Honey Toast with Bacon, Chicken Truffle Grain bowl, etc. They also server local delights such as Beef Stew, Kimchi Luncheon Stew with Koka Noodles, Nyoya Chicken Curry Rice, etc. Note: the menu may change from time to time. üòÑ\n\nMy favorite:\nTom Yum Pasta with King Prawns: Spicy, sweet, sour, feisty and fiery that sum up this tantalizing fusion Thai-Italian Tom Yum Pasta with mouthwatering and fiery Giant King Prawns! üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç\n\nService:\nThe staff are super friendly, helpful and attentive and really reserved a 5 stars from me.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe caf√© is located inside Zion Bishan Church. The restaurant looks simple with friendly and cozy environment you want to do some work or read a book. Note that there are not many tables and you may need to call for checking there are seats available or the restaurant is closed for events.\n\nVerdict:\nIt is a friendly neighborhood cafe set within Zion Bishan Church. They serve fairly good meals that made in their own kitchen. I usually dropped by to enjoy a cup of hot coffee and a warm meal. At the same time, enjoying my easy-peasy ‚Äúme‚Äù time to get away from hustle and bustle time for the week. Happy weekend ahead!",

Another must-try is the Mushroom Tom Yum pasta, which tastes authentic. Other things we usually order include: Flat White coffee, Tiramisu, and the Apple Crumble with ice cream. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Service is great without service charge. Highly recommend.",
