Clarence Loh,5,"Probably the best chicken rice in Tanglin Halt.
Chicken breast is not too dry at all, It's soft and juicy. Portion is very generous, I can't even see my rice and uncle is friendly. Best part is uncle do not smack the meat until flat flat.
Big bowl of soup as well, sometimes you get chicken feet in the soup. Chili is punchy with ginger garlicky taste. They have curry chicken noodles too!
Tell me where can you still find such valuable and tasty chicken rice.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115399433230500221684/reviews
Malcolm Sng,5,"The chicken rice with ginger scallion sauce is good. But the curry noodles are AMAZING.

Very VERY reasonably priced and always big portions of chicken. Please visit these 2 kings, their curry noodles run out around 1pm. Have ate at this place almost every time I am here.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111455738035069725904/reviews
David Lim,5,"The amount of chicken they give is a gym broâ€™s dream. Chicken is tender, rice and sauce is flavourful, chilli is pretty good too.

Overall a fantastic value option for protein that tastes great too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107248850710781236429/reviews
Weng Wanying,5,"Amazing dishes! From your regular chicken rice to curry chicken noodles! They take both dishes up a notch.

The food taste fresh and most importantly flavourful. You can expect the best powdery curry potatoes you can get if you get the curry noodles (or just curry with potato and taupok!)

They ensure you are well-fed with food portion sizes.

Bonus: super friendly!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110554993665598175287/reviews
Goo Bakmi,5,"Not sure why not too many reviews here but really very nice chicken rice in Tanglin Halt. The queue is consistently there and so business is good.  Rice is not oily, chicken is fresh and taste good and chilli got kick.  Will certainly come back when I am around this area.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104071409397230107746/reviews
