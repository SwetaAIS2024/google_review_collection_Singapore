This outlet is brand new as they relocated. It’s facing the multi-storey carpark linked by a bridge. It’s nicely designed and the new shampoo chairs are more comfortable now.\n\nI have always enjoyed the excellent customer service of the Bukit Merah team since I started 3 years ago. They are patient, friendly and professional.",

Nobody tries to sell me any package or products- so it’s a blissful experience every time. Now they moved to a new location nearer central, I also followed them here.",

      "text": "I have been going to Bee Choo for years now. I think they are affordable and provide good service. Since coming here monthly, my hair is less oily and more healthy. They have 2 options of herbal hair treatment: normal/colour. If you choose the colour option, it helps to cover your Gray hair too. The Gray hair will turn golden red orange and not so obvious. Good option if you don't have that many Gray hair. By the way they are now at a new location which is nearer to Bukit Merah Central, which is very accessible!",

The staff at Bukit Merah were friendly and gentle during the whole process. They were patient with my questions and even recommended a suitable shampoo for my current scalp condition. Thank you :))",
