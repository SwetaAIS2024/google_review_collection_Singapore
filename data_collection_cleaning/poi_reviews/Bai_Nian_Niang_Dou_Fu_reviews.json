The umami, savoury flavours complemented its crispy yet bouncy texture, making it a superb dish.\n\nBai Nian Yong Tau Foo ($5.90) – A hearty bowl of silky bee hoon, homemade prawn paste balls, egg tofu, white stick, gold stick, and bitter gourd in a rich, savoury soup topped with spring onions. The ingredients were bouncy and juicy, though the soup was slightly salty and high in MSG. Still, a comforting and affordable meal.",
