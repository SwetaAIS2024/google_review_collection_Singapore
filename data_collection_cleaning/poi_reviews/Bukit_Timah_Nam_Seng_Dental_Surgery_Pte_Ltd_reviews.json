He tells me in advance what he will be doing and what i might feel during the treatment, this relieves my anxiety.\nI also see him checking in on an elderly personally after the treatment as she was feeling light headed.\nThe nurse assisting him is also very attentive.\nI recommend this dental clinic to anyone who are undecided to which to go to.\nThis is my second visit after 2 years. I think wasn't attended by Dr Tan then.\nAfter these 2 visits, I can say they are both excellent doctors and I don't regret coming here for dental treatments.",
