      "text": "Located in Kopitiam Hillion Mall (L2). Pretty good experience with this place. Staffs were patient and friendly. Place is halal. Food was good and portion worth the price. I couldn't finish what I ordered. 1 French fries. 1 Seaweed chicken. 1 Fish fillet carbonara pasta. Had to takeaway last min so I bought a takeaway box for 30cents. ($19.90 excluding Kopitiam discount and take away box)\n\nLots of variaties from Salad to Pasta to chips. I'd rather eat here than Pastamania or any other fast food chain. Will be back again.\n\nWheelchair friendly too.",

Instead of big leafy vegetables, I got a thin slice of broccoli and a small tomato. The whitish spots on the sauce are cheese. When I complained to the counter the reply was outside the stall was only a photo, implying not to expect what I purchase to look like the photo!",

(the staff added extra chili padi for me). The addition of broccoli, chicken, and mushrooms made the pasta even more flavorful. The salmon was also nicely cooked.",
