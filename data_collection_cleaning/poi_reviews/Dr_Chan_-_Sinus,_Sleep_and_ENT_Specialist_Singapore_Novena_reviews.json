      "text": "PLEASE DON’T BELIEVE ANY OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS YOU SEE HERE. ABSOLUTE WORST DOCTOR EVER. The only people whom he is kind towards are patients who look rich and powerful. Visited this doctor many years ago. Surprised that he’s still in business. Only interested to siphon as much money as possible from me. Not only was he dismissive and rude he was mocking me when I told him about my problems. Terrible attitude towards his staff. He secretly charged an additional $90 to my bill for a procedure he didn’t even perform. He knew I had insurance. Very dishonest. Don’t ever visit this doctor. There’re many other ENT specialists available.",

      "text": "I had an extremely distressing experience with Dr. Chan. He was not only impatient and rude, but his approach was also shockingly unprofessional. During the visit, he and his nurse restrained my 2-year-old daughter with a blanket on the bed to perform a nasal procedure, completely ignoring her terrified screams. Despite her suffering, he found nothing but still prescribed an excessive amount of antibiotics. The very next day, my daughter's eyes became swollen and bloodshot, forcing us to rush her to KK Hospital. There, an ENT specialist informed us that both the procedure and antibiotics were entirely unnecessary. This experience was traumatic for us, and I would strongly caution others to avoid this clinic. Proceed at your own risk!",

      "text": "Dr. Chan treated my daughter for a sinus infection that started as a cold, moved to bronchitis, then pneumonia. The pediatrician put her on an antibiotic and she kept getting worse. When we went to see Dr. Chan, my daughter was better within a couple of days. The level of care was exceptional, he works well with children and adults, and I would highly recommend! He really takes the time to make sure you understand! The frontliners, Fifi and team were awesome. The service they provide is superb and good in handling fussy toddler like my daughter. Would definitely recommends my entire family and friends.",

We were reassured by his experienced advices & treatment.\nHe has ongoing sinus issues as well, did a skin prick test in clinic & found out that he was allergic to dustmites. We were given necessary medications & nose spray to keep it under control and he is dealing much better with his allergies now.\n\nThank you, Dr Chan.",
