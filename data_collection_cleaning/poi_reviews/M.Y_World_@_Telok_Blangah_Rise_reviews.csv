Steve Liow,4,"My two grand children attend lessons at this place. I had a lot of direct interaction with the teachers from the center. Apart from their commitment to deliver good education to the students, they are also very caring and loving teachers to the children. The center also provides constant upgrading programmes for the teachers, had strong religious teachings to interest the boys and girls. I am impress and would strongly recommend the center if you want peace of mind and reasonable religious education for the kids.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117025936013299168041/reviews
