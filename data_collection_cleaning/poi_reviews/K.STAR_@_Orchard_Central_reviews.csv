RachelCJH,5,"Oevin provided superb service to us and assisted us promptly in everything we need, including enabling the AV system for us to play a short video. Kudos to the rest of the team who supported as well. Can feel that they’re all trying to make it the best experience for us. Fuss free booking. Helpful staffs. Awesome VIP room. The only thing that could be further improved would the waiting time for food. Thank u!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103926795680239315631/reviews
Clemence Yap,5,We recently held our department's year-end celebration in the VVIP room. The room was cozy and spacious with well-positioned screens and a pool table and darts machine. The food and drinks were excellent. The Hibiki and yuzu sake were big hits with our team. The staff in particular took really good care of us and ensured that we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and partied the whole night away. Kudos to Raymond and his crew for doing a great job hosting us.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100875582208773240847/reviews
S. Tan,5,Nice experience! Booked the VIP room 777 for a birthday party for about 30 ppl and I must say it was a very good deal. All my friends enjoyed the night very much and the space and sound system together with a darts and pool machine in the room really made the night fun! The screen was also big and nice and we could adjust the atmosphere and lights to our liking. The room had a total of 5 mics which allowed everyone to have their share of mic time. They did some simple deco for us for the birthday party too! Appreciate it!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111771820195886617639/reviews
