Staff was v polite and helpful, especially in informing of promotions. Only bad thing is it's too small and v chaotic because of the constant crowd",

      "text": "Food is pretty grim so as adults, we didn’t really eat. There’s two areas to order food from here - the kiosk outside which has some simple fried chicken on sticks (avoid the chicken with seaweed, it’s such a weird combo - to my tastes anyway) and corn dogs. For items from the menu you have to order inside but can bring it to the outside tables. I ordered the chicken spaghetti which two children quite liked and one child downright rejected, and the potato wedges without the paprika seasoning. i quite liked that the spaghetti came with quail’s eggs but of course the kids refused to touch these (I ate them instead).\n\nThe best bit about this place is that you can sit and have some nibbles while the kids are in the splash park.",

We have requested the staff to turn off the fan as it is very cold, they did it in an instant. Kudos to the team. There is a gift shop beside the cafe that sells cute items featuring chick and eggs, becareful for those with children since u might end up paying more than just food.",
