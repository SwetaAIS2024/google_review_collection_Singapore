ronaldpung,5,"Nice chill vibes to the place with limited seating and good cafe food.
Rosti was the highlight for us. The chicken sausage that came with it and the breakfast set was great too.
Enjoyed the prawn laksa pasta that was surprisingly spicy. Taupok and prawns were üëçüëç.
Daughter had the carbonara which she enjoyed and finished too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107194534868698118185/reviews
Sebaskaren,5,"Had brunch here. Love the atmosphere and the food here.  Very healthy options and reminds one of aussie cafes. The sausage in the rosti seems to be homemade, no synthetic covering and not salty at all unlike other cafes. Definitely will visit again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102433314299308350965/reviews
Vel1293,4,"First time visiting this cafe, loved how quiet and calming the cafe is. Probably just the timing I went. Had the chicken pesto with added prawns and a dark iced chocolate. Both were really good. Not salty. Staff is friendly and respectful, that‚Äôs of utmost importance in every cafe! Food is secondary to the service! Overall it‚Äôs a great place. This cafe might become my regular spot!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103438896122013400472/reviews
Jing Kai Kevin Lim,4,"The food was above average, and we truly enjoyed it. The minimalist interior setting stood out the most‚Äîcool, calming, and well-thought-out. The ambience is perfect for relaxing, working, or even spending a quiet moment with a book and good music. With reasonable prices and a great overall vibe, ORdinary is a spot I‚Äôd definitely recommend for anyone seeking a laid-back yet stylish environment",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107019201428872341790/reviews
Kimberley Howarth,5,"Really nice cafe with a good menu and friendly helpful staff. The coffee still leaves much to be desired tho... my Americano was very watery and acidic. Hope you can improve your brewing technique or get better beans. But all the food is delicious and well presented. I am impressed. I ordered a Stolen Recipe salmon chunk soup, it was really really delicious and hearty. Nice bread too. My friend's shakshuka also looked really good. We will definitely return again to try more of the interesting things on the menu.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957590885643931784/reviews
