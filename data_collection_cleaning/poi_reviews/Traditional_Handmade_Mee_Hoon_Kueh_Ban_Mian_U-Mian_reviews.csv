AL,1,"This store is helmed by old couple for many years for morning breakfast till lunch. Recently it was helmed by 2 young chaps for evening session. Not sure if they are related to the old couple.

At first look, food appeal just goes down to zero. Its a case of cutting corners.

Greens vegetables choy sum or xiao bai cai has been replaced with cheaper chinese cabbage, where the servings serves less than 1/2 leaf. Plus 2 slices of button mushroom.

Noodle serving serves 4 mouthful, depending on the size of your spoon. Have to dig up just for photo shoot so it looks ""more""!

Soup seems like the most expensive ingredient, as i notice others getting even lesser than what you see in photo.

And in the meantime, the 2 chaps were talking about the cost price of replacing the plastic takeaway containers.

At $4, 1 cannot expect too much but this is just way too low ball...

And please, don't offer a $1 discount for google reviews. People are not pathetic to the extend to write a review for $1 discount of such food standard.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104678560206409383002/reviews
Touristmouse,4,"This stall, helmed by a friendly elderly couple, seems to operate at its own pace. My Monday late morning visit, supposedly an off-peak hour, resulted in a 20-minute wait for my order.

Here, everything is made fresh upon order. I opted for the Mee Hoon Kueh with Dumplings ($5.20, with egg). Each bowl comes with a trio of dumplings, sliced shiitake and straw mushrooms,  shanghai green vegetable and a decent portion hand-torn mee hoon kueh.

The star of the show is the hand-torn mee hoon kueh itself. It boasts a chewy texture that complements the light and flavourful broth. The accompanying pork dumplings are equally unassuming, with a simple seasoning that lets the natural flavours shine.

The portion size might leave you wanting more, especially if you're famished.  This is a perfect option for a light lunch. Overall, I recommend this stall only if you have some time to spare and a hankering for a bowl ofmee hoon kueh.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110409011587721664076/reviews
Rachel Song,1,"Took 30 mins to give me my order. Charged me take away money and mentioned I didn’t say take away at all. Served the guy who was 5 mins after I ordered first with his food, because apparently they know each other? Will not recommend to go again. Food is soso.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100542742475765735397/reviews
Jeremy Teng,2,"Very disappointing Bukit Panjang #1 mee hoon kuey. Too thick, broth too little flavour, too long wait, too little ingredients. What else not to like? Especially calling yourselves the best.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100877805630930813915/reviews
