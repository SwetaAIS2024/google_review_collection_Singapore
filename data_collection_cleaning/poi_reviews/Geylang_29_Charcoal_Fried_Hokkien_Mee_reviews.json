And only comes with this one tiny chilli packet. The aunty refused to give more when I asked. Was also really rude about it. Generally did not have a good feeling after buying from this store. Would NOT recommend. Theres a much better store run by a really nice uncle just a bit further down.",

Will have to wait for around 15 mins on a weekend night after making your order. The $10 serving is just nice for one person. Comes in other sizes from $7 to $25.",

Definitely waited 15min or more.\n\nToo hungry to stop and take a picture of the noodles.\n\nVerdict:\nno wok hey\nTaste is ok not life changing\nA little dry for my liking\nfresh cut chillies, v little sambal chilli given\nPrawns are fresh and crunchy\n\nDidn’t live up to its reputation.",
