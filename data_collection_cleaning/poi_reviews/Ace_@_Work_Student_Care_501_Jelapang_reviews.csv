Judy Kph,5,"Ace @ Work Student Care provide a safe and friendly environment for our children to rest, relax and play after school so we can have ease of mind at work. Supervisor Shu Luan and teachers are very helpful and prompt in response to provide utmost support to our children. Apart from daily school works supervision, they will do their best to help children in their academic achievement and character development. Aunty Teo, is very kind and wonderful caregiver whom liked by many children.

Thank you everyone at Ace @ Work Student Care for everything you have done for our children! Appreciated your hard work!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103989428353816383304/reviews
Jonathan Edward Lahey,1,"Remembered being enrolled here more than 10 years ago.

I got hurled abuse by teachers until I cried really bad as my chinese was not the best and I could not remember the characters well enough. As a less than 10 year old kid I did not realised that it was a very serious thing.

I was always sent late to school because my school was the furtherst away from the center compared to the other kids in choa chu kang. I remember mentioning this but I got told ""too bad"".

Sadly as I am a petty person when it comes to such incidents. Hopefully they have at least phased out the teachers and improved their standards, otherwise please avoid.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117014460573651488085/reviews
William Lim,2,"Would not recommend this centre to anyone else. Apparently the teachers there are working part time. Also have poor experience with them.

One of the example, the teacher also require them to take the rubbish bag from the centre and throw it to the bin outside the centre (this kind of job should have taken care by the centre cleaner).",12 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108395689124353221949/reviews
