This fountain is kinda like in the middle of a roundabout. And underneath this roundabout is part of a shopping mall, where I hangout to have my lunch while enjoying the view of this fountain. There‚Äôs stairs around the fountain from the street, headed down directly to the shopping mall, where the f&b level is. You can enter the fountain for free from the mall and take pictures. And there‚Äôs some cool instructions you can follow and enjoy to get the wealth vibe I guess. Something like that. And I had a really great lunch at Tongue Tip Lanzhou Beef Noodles. Its halal and I had 2 cups of their homemade sour plum drink. So refreshing.",

      "text": "Review of Singapore City and the Fountain of Wealth\n\nSingapore, often referred to as the ‚ÄúLion City,‚Äù is a dazzling metropolis that effortlessly blends tradition and modernity. Renowned as a global hub for business, culture, and innovation, this city-state is a testament to visionary urban planning and technological excellence. Among its many iconic attractions, the Fountain of Wealth at Suntec City stands out as a symbol of prosperity and unity, perfectly embodying the city‚Äôs futuristic spirit.\n\nThe Fountain of Wealth, a Guinness World Record holder as the largest fountain in the world, is not just an architectural marvel but also a cultural icon. Nestled in the heart of Suntec City, its design is deeply rooted in feng shui principles, with five surrounding towers representing fingers of a hand and the fountain itself symbolizing the palm holding wealth. The circular design and the inward-flowing water are said to signify the retention of fortune, a belief that resonates with visitors seeking luck and prosperity.\n\nWhat makes the Fountain of Wealth truly remarkable is its immersive experience. During designated hours, visitors can walk around the base of the fountain, touching the water for good luck. In the evening, the fountain transforms into a visual masterpiece with stunning laser shows, synchronized lights, and music that captivate audiences. The display is a perfect representation of Singapore‚Äôs technological prowess and its commitment to creating unforgettable experiences.\n\nBeyond the fountain, Singapore City offers a harmonious blend of lush greenery, state-of-the-art architecture, and a vibrant cultural scene. Iconic landmarks such as Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, and the futuristic Helix Bridge showcase the city‚Äôs architectural innovation. Meanwhile, cultural enclaves like Chinatown, Little India, and Kampong Glam provide glimpses into Singapore‚Äôs rich multicultural heritage.\n\nSingapore‚Äôs seamless infrastructure, including its world-class public transportation system, makes exploring the city a breeze. From indulging in Michelin-starred hawker food to shopping in luxurious malls like Orchard Road, every aspect of Singapore exudes sophistication and charm.\n\nThe Fountain of Wealth, much like the city it resides in, is a shining example of how tradition and innovation can coexist harmoniously. Whether you‚Äôre a first-time visitor or a frequent traveler, Singapore‚Äôs breathtaking skyline, vibrant attractions, and cultural diversity will leave an indelible impression.\n\nVerdict:\nSingapore is a city like no other‚Äîa place where the past meets the future, and the Fountain of Wealth stands as a beacon of its success and aspirations. A visit to this dynamic city-state is more than a journey; it‚Äôs an experience that redefines what a modern metropolis can achieve.",

Entering to touch water at the fountain by free of charge but limitation the amount of allowed people and open session time. The fountains displayed when they are open and when they are closed are different. Can spend half a day or more just to see the fountains and walk around/shopping in the mall.",
