Green Nick,4,"Waited 20mins for the $18 tomahawk and it was reasonably good. The spices was abundant and the char taste turns out pretty well.

L Y,4,"2024.11.22

Was collecting car fm car workshop . Decided to get a quick bite. Did a Google search and this came up.
For $8, the two slices of grilled pork chop, pasta, salad, and potato mash is pretty substantial. Grilled pork chop is a 7/10. Pasta is overcooked. Mash tasted like premix. lettuce is normal. i would have rated a 3 but for the price point, it deserves a 4.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116804450051508415316/reviews
