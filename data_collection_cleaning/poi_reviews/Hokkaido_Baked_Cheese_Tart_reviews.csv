LY Chan (lychan911),2,"Just bought 3 cheese tart from the Parkway Parade branch.  Didn’t go for the buy5free1 promo as we can’t finish so many tarts in 2 days.  In the end all 3 of our tarts mixed together, all the liquid cheese inside leaked all over the box/container.     My point is, if customer choose not to buy 5+1.  Then they’ll get crumbled cheese tart? As shop don have better way to package the cheese tart with lesser quantity like 3?",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104719522903045016051/reviews
Sara Kaye Lim,5,"Fresh, creamy and so delightful! Hokkaido cheese tarts never disappoint. The servers consistently pack them securely for takeaway & a brief reheating at home gets them nice and toasty again. Highly recommend!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106305602922966058160/reviews
Hai Peng Lam,5,"This was the first time I had the Hokkaido Baked Cheese Tarts, Original Flavored. If not for their 6th Anniversary 1 for 1 Promotion, I most probably will not have the opportunity to enjoy the tart. They were absolutely Scrumptious!!!! My strong yearning for the baked cheese tart started after I saw the creamy yummy cheese flowing out of the half-eaten tart by my colleague. When I bought a box of 6 baked cheese tarts, after treating my colleagues, I unwittingly devoured the remainder 3 cheese tarts in less than 5 mins, and I was in heaven! It was fabulous! As you can see from the photo, all the original flavored Hakkaido Baked Cheese Tarts were sold & gone, all boxed up waiting for their buyers to collect. Yum yum yumz!!! Will definitely come back again!!! 👏👍💪😋🤗",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118395190886911771500/reviews
Supreet Kini,5,"Love their cheese tarts. Took a set of 5+1.

Served fresh, and at times they have new flavours. Went for 1 each of chocolate, brownie, durian, blueberry, almond chocolate and salted caramel.

Can store in the fridge for 3 days and reheat only for 20-30 seconds in the microwave before eating them.

Durian is an all-time favourite followed by chocolate.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105328280516267995599/reviews
Rahul Chawra,4,"Had tried the cheese tarts from the same brand while in Japan and they were outstanding. However, what I was craving in this visit was the Hokkaido soft serve. I would say that I’m a bit disappointed and probably scarred for life after having the Cremia and Milkcream Hokkaido milk soft serve ice-cream in Japan. I’ve been comparing all the places in Singapore to it and nothing even comes close. My search will continue in future because even this place doesn’t come anywhere close to it. I’ll probably try out the cheese-tarts here but not the soft serve for sure.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117518318552645778414/reviews
