Donald Ang,5,"I spilled curry in the boot of my car and I thought it was a goner. The smell permeated throughout the car and the stench was horrible even thought I did surface cleaning. I knew the curry had seeped through under the carpet and I engaged Deon to help me look into this.

He was a very detailed and thorough person who takes pride in his work. He explained every step that he is taking and was very meticulous in his job. He dismantled my 3rd row seat and carpet underneath to reveal a pool of curry sitting beneath it. The cleaning was exceptional and my car no longer has the stench. Fantastic service and I would highly recommend Deon to anyone who requires deep cleaning and spillage clean up.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107952379593923988431/reviews
Bruce Lee,5,"Deon was highly recommended by a friend. Saw cockroaches in the car for past week and reached out for help and Deon recommended a package based on the current situation. Entire cleaning procedure went smoothly, Deon was very professional and did a great job flushing out the cockroaches (20+!) and also cleaned the entire interior. He did a very thorough job and car interior had a nice new car smell when completed. Most importantly there was peace of mind that the car was thoroughly cleaned and cockroach free!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108909165146580973591/reviews
Weihong Neo,5,"Hi all! Just want to share my delightful experience with Deon (Steam Artes)!

I contacted him last night at around 1130pm (wasn't expecting a reply that late), but he immediately responded to my query and gave very helpful information, even offering to do so over a call when I had more queries. Was not pushy, and gave very targeted solutions upon his assessment of my car's pest situation ('Oh, no need to do so much, just the basic one can already').

Just finished the 'Super Flush Out' session with him. Deon gave very practical and useful advice on preventive measures, and was very principled about not upselling unnecessary solutions. He even went the extra mile to learn about my family's car usage and routines so that he can dish out advice that is on point.

Initially I thought I was dealing with a 'one or two cockroach' situation, but you guys will be surprised at what comes up after a fumigation session ðŸ«  Suffice to say, I'm fully satisfied with this excellent recommendation and would also highly recommend everyone to book a session!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113219871156879744109/reviews
