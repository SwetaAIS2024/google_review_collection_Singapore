Everything was super yummy - from Black Pepper Prawns, Coffee Midwing, Marinated Chicken Wing, Otah as well as Pork and Mutton Satay. The marinades were done very well and price is reasonable for this amount of food. Satay gravy was delicious too!\n\nWill definitely be recommending to my friends and family :)",

Satay was OK but meat size average. Pork chop was also thinly sliced.\n2. Go for medium prawns. The smaller size really too small to handle.\n3. Fried bee hoon is too oily.\n\nAlso do allow time to thaw the meat before guests arrive.",

Items worth recommending are honey chicken wings, satay (chicken, mutton, pork), cooked otah in banana leaf. The stingray, potato and sweet corn were slightly small so do consider ordering more for larger crowd. Hope to order next time:)",
