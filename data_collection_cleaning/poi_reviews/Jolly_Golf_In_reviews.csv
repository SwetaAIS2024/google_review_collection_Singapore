Alanna,4,"A great place to hang out - upstairs offers a space to play mini golf, Nintendo plus PS5 games, and karaoke. You can also host private events here.

We tried their Buka Puasa Menu which comes with a main and drink. Acceptable taste and good meat portions.

Excellent service with friendly staff too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109170802800041082215/reviews
Farah Farhana,5,"Welcoming by friendly staff & manager, help me to setup Nintendo game. Very ambient and calm place to rest and have a good time with your partner, family and friends. I tried their pizza  truffle mulligan and golden banana bliss, it was soooo delicious & yummy. Their mocktails also very fresh. Overall I gave them 5 stars for the services and food.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102819384519736300988/reviews
Selvinia Nofy,5,"I would give the staff more than 5 stars if I could; they are incredibly friendly and helpful! As for the place and ambience, it's just okay. They have a minigolf course and a karaoke room on the second floor, but the stairs are located outside, right next to the main door.

In terms of food, I think there is room for improvement. I ordered karaage chicken, but it was a bit overcooked, leaving a bitter taste. The banana split was just okay.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102676437011264302982/reviews
Sow Chun Leong,5,"I tell you. We 4 were walking past this place to the next eatery. I thought this is a golf academy or a golf club repair place. But, the few ladies in green smiled and showed us a food menu.  I peeped inside. Saw many nice tables. And a stage. We order 2 buckets of Carlsberg, some finger food, and, we took the stage 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Will be back 😂😂💪💪👍",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101214046367864810819/reviews
Fais Isa,5,"The place is nice to hangout with friends and family. Children friendly, the food is simple but affordable. Try their creamy duck pasta! They have everything here to pass time quickly. Their activity room is spacious and cozy. Would love to come here again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107192357557960146484/reviews
