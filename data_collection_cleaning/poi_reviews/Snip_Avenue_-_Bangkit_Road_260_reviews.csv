nex5 user,1,"To the Management of Snip Avenue,

I recently brought my child for a haircut at one of your branches Bangkit. During the session, after the initial cut was completed, I politely requested for some areas to be trimmed slightly shorter.

The stylist in question—a male, Chinese, chubby in build—appeared visibly displeased when I made the request. Although he eventually proceeded with the trimming, I was concerned to later hear from my child that he may have acted with unnecessary roughness. Specifically, my child mentioned feeling discomfort, as if the stylist was intentionally pulling his hair while trimming after my request.

I am disappointed to hear this, as I expect all staff—especially when dealing with children—to maintain professionalism and care. No worry I will still consider visiting this branch again to experience for any improvement after this feedback. Should a similar incident occur in the future involving the same stylist, I will not hesitate to file a formal police report.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114563653900947124384/reviews
Jiang XD,1,"Never go to this salon! There was a China hairstylist who did my hair. He provided the worst service ever. Been to many other neighbourhood salons and this was an utter disappointment. On top of the bad techniques, he kept promoting products and packages and sounded annoyed when I refused to purchase them. Treated me with the littlest patience. Please train your staff!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101628246090297125020/reviews
Low Evangeline,1,"Don't go there. Their service is terribly bad especially if you sign up a package with them. They look down the fact that you sign their package and enjoy cheap haircuts. A good lesson learnt. The hairstylist can finish cutting your hair in less than 5min,so what do  u think ? This is the result !!!!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100228394154452682798/reviews

caramel,1,"DISHONEST BUSINESS! TLDR: Gave worst cut of my life, publicly degraded and scolded me for no reason.

The hairdresser Ann (she had her hair tied up, looks middle aged) scolded me when I said I don’t want to wash my hair, then proceeded to very quickly cut my hair (",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101221475012380994970/reviews
