Grace Liu,5,"It is not easy for beginners to learn Latin dance. If the movements are not in place, there will be no sense of achievement and it‘s easy to give up. Yukie is a good teacher. She has good skills meanwhile, most importantly, she has patience. Her patience and meticulousness made me persist. Thank you.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105290290517855335408/reviews
S T,5,"Was able to pick up Latin dancing from absolutely zero experience.

The key differentiator is that the Instructor is able to communicate patiently and emphasize on the right techniques to perform the dance movement.

Great community as well — Always positive vibes and open sharing of knowledge.
Everyone is here to enjoy and improve.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112719050846060027325/reviews
