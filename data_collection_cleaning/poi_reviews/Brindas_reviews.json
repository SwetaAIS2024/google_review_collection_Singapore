      "text": "When i think about a place where you can have some privacy to have meals, i think of this place. The place wasn't packed, ( for some reasons) which gave me more time to order the meal of my choice.  Food maybe a bit pricy but worth every bite and i was stuffed. The staffs there are very approachable and i don't have any bad feedback i can give about them. A compliment i can give is that they were very polite to disable residents. They spoke in a very friendly tone, alerted him when they serve the food for him even though its self service and placed his food in the tray return once he's finished with his meal. There's a self service station, clean restrooms and tray return station nearby. There wasn't any negative vibes from this place at all. I just really wish more people will dine in here in the future.",

Really appreciate this attention and service from Brindas. Ordered vegetarian meal and it was good and tasty with good portions. Well labeled food packets to easily identify the content instead of opening it and checking what it contains. Thank you Brindas! ðŸ™‚",

Quantity was good too.\n\nService is fast and polite.\n\nOne minus however is that the toilet was a little disgusting as it was wet and there were a lot of wet tissues on the floor.",
