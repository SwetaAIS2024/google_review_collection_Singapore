      "text": "I just wanted to try a new milk tea store but I ended up super impressed! I tried the signature Orchid Bilochun milk tea (w the recommended oats topping, 30% sugar, no ice).\n\nThe milk tea drink was super gao (thick/rich) from the first sip. Strong tea aroma with slight bitterness, paired with a floral fragrance. It was really good?! It‚Äôs a real quality drink.\n\nThe oats topping was really interesting too, with something similar to barley texture. Compared to regular pearl or jelly topping, this was much less sweet, yet you still get a topping to chew on. It went well with the drink!\n\nI‚Äôll definitely recommend to try!!! 30% sugar was just nice for me. This place has seating area btw!!",

      "text": "Among the many bubble tea brands at Jurong Point, I decided to try this new store offering biluochun as its specialty! Had the Orchid Biluochun pure tea with osmanthus jelly (the other available topping is oats), with a strong tea taste, abit bitter so best to choose at least 50% sugar level. Might try their mochi desserts (called Nuo ji ji) next time, since there‚Äôs a seating area!\n\nIG @pingguo301",

      "text": "Nothing beats a relaxing and therapeutic drink from this place, after a long day‚Äôs shopping.\n\nAs a first visit, I went for one of the two signature drinks - Orchid Biluochun Milk Tea and found it odd that I wasn‚Äôt asked the sugar level nor the toppings for this drink. Assuming it might be fixed, I didn‚Äôt bother checking with the cashier. But as soon as she reconfirmed my order, she shared that for a first visit, she‚Äôll recommend me to have the drink at 50% sugar level.\n\nOrder came right up shortly, and I was surprised how fragrant it was. The first sip was very sweet, but as I went on with the next few sips, I knew why the cashier lady recommended 50% sugar level as their brew was much stronger than a lot other bubble tea stalls out there, and the sugar complemented it well. And the barley pearls that came with the drink blended well with the flavours.\n\nLooking forward to my next visit already. üòç",

I tried their signatures grape white peach which have grape seeds inside too‚Ä¶. And the orchid Bi Luo Chun which is indeed milky. Oh also the Suzhou Nuo Jiji is my favourite for $7 and it‚Äôs like a good combi of soft mochi paste with green and red beans and yam. Will be back for more of this dessert.",
