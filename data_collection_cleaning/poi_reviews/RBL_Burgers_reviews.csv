Chetan Mehra Photography,4,"Burger and fries were not hot when arrived.

But my God, the taste is incredible. Beef was medium rare and cooked to perfection. Fries were amazing. I wish I got them hot.

I will definitely order again",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103014119405306655981/reviews
G Lim,2,Should have read the reviews before orderingâ€¦. Burger is not bad and the buns are pillowy soft. The problem is with the cheese used. Why would the restaurant choose to use cheap-tasting cheese sauce for their burgers? With the aioli sauce the burger tasted way too creamy and jelat.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114129444675110371609/reviews
Aik Thong Tan,5,"Just ordered this for a late dinner with my wife.

I had the cheeseburger, missus the non-meat schnitzel, and we shared a bacon and cheese fries.

The burgers were really good - cheeseburger is likely the best i had for takeout man. Wife thought the schnitzel tasted like chicken. Buns were fluffy and toasted also. And the fries were amazing - still crispy when delivered!

So 5 stars to show some love.ðŸ¤—",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115389804879089587244/reviews
Seehal Shah,1,"I ordered from here and the first time, the food was incredible. I re-ordered with some guests via Grab raving about their Harvest Burger, and how it was realistic. After three bites, I was advised it tasted realistic because it was real chicken and not vegetarian! I contacted Grab who advised me that the kitchen was actually aware prior to delivery that the food was incorrect, but failed to advise us. I have attempted to contact them numerous times, and have been promised follow up, but this has never happened. Obviously a company that does not care about its clientele, but more importantly is negligent and careless with no remorse.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118005621760022279442/reviews
P H,3,"Sorry but the bacon in your burger and cheese fries really cannot make it. Cheeseburger didnt even have a slice of cheese, just some nacho cheese sauce",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115460040189163076757/reviews
