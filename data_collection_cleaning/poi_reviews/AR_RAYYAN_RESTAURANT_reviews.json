It tasted almost medicinal/ woody. Undrinkable.\n\n2 sips and decided not to drink and paid for it.\n\n-----\nMay '24\nAs more people get to experience Poori, it is slowly gathering popularity akin to coin prata.\n\nUsing wheat flour, it is moulded and followed by deep frying till it is bloated.\n\nIts taste and texture were light and airy. The potato and onion mix was creamy and with a hint of sweetness. A spicy mix was also provided for those who like some heat. These condiments may vary from each establishment.\n\nMenu board with available dishes.\nService is prompt and friendly. Place is relatively clean.",

      "text": "The briyani rice was the absolute star, really really fantastic. Mutton was nice, the tandoor version was more tender than the non-tandoor. Horlicks is a classic, generous amount. Place is nice and clean with plenty of seating. The menu is quite extensive but we only had briyani. Prices are reasonable. We will return to try more things like the prata and goreng dishes.",

However, what’s frustrating is that customers who ordered after me—both for dine-in and takeaway—received their food before I did.\n\nThis isn’t the first time it’s happened either. It’s the second time I’ve experienced such poor queue management at your outlet. Please follow the basic principle of serving according to the order sequence. It’s not just fair; it’s expected.\n\nI really hope this can be improved, because it’s getting frustrating.",
