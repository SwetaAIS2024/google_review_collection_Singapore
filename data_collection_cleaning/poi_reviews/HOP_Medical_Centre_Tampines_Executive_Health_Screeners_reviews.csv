Dayao,5,Came for the health screening and the whole process was very smooth. The front counter staff and the nurse were very clear about the process and there was no delay. The doctor will explain in detail the different tests that I can opt in. There is no hard selling on the different packages and I felt comfortable throughout.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109685567109689442361/reviews
MeiFong Chen,5,"I had a great experience at HOP Tampines branch for my medical check-up. The service was excellent, with friendly and helpful staff throughout the process. Despite my last-minute request for an additional ultrasound check, they went out of their way to accommodate it. Special thanks to nurse Renee, who was super friendly and took the extra effort to ensure the completeness of the ultrasound scan. I truly appreciate the care and professionalism shown and will definitely return to this branch for my yearly check-ups.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111584612482150135361/reviews
hadirman shah,5,"I had my yearly medical checkup at HOP Medical Centre (Tampines) and was thoroughly impressed. The staff were incredibly friendly and professional, making the entire process smooth and pleasant. This was my first time visiting the Tampines outlet, and I must say, the experience was just as superb as my previous visit to their Orchard outlet.

A special shoutout to Aron, whom I believe is the manager. He went above and beyond by ensuring everything was running smoothly. He personally checked in with customers, updated us on our status, and made sure we were comfortable throughout the visit.

The level of care and attention to detail at HOP Medical Centre is truly commendable.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114599935449442515537/reviews
