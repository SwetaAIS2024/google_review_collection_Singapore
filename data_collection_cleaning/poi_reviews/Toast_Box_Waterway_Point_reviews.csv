Balidronelady,3,"The food was great, no complaints there. However, the experience at the cashier & beverages maker were quite the opposite—the lady at the counter was unexpectedly cold and intimidating, which took away from the otherwise pleasant visit. Honestly, I was a bit taken aback.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100498999725294631690/reviews
Charmaine Ng,1,"Our family always enjoyed toastbox for their food and service, but this morning, one of their staff completely ruined our good mood with her impatient and rude attitude. I believe her name is called 碧芬. First, she impatiently hurried me to scan my credit card while I was getting ready my phone, then when I asked her to scan my Yuu points, she refused and told me that I should have told her before I order. Utter nonsense!!

I dont usually write negative review and i dont think its fair to judge toastbox based on one staff’s poor attitude, but I hope the management can be more aware of such staff to not affect their good reputation and ruin other customer’s experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101489038997298898016/reviews
IXK,5,Loved the pink bread and it add a smile to my boring weekday... I visit this outlet at least twice a week and love the coffee and kaya toast here. Staffs here are super friendly and this is what I call a great kopi place!,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111131336266290555195/reviews
Lim,1,"The staff who take orders and prepare for coffee are very friendly. However, the one who prepares the toast is so ignorant, I ordered Kaya toast bread with very little butter, but she purposely prepared it with full butter and she still denied it. I told her to show me and her face turned black. With the amount of butter that she puts, does she intentionally want to make people unhealthy? Perhaps HPB can take action on it.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106101108792203054139/reviews
Alvin Quah,2,"Very bad experience with the staff and food from the Waterway Point outlet. Cashier auntie was impatient and rude. She did not even tell me I could order a set for my food and drinks. Instead I was charged separately. Mee rebus was horrid, gravy was tasteless and watery.. very diluted. Plus they just couldn't be bothered to even put the gravy properly.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118052387079754411357/reviews
