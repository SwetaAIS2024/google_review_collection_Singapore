In Feb 2024, the Steamilicious soup stall and Tong Fong Fatt chicken rice stall has closed, while the Tanjong Rhu Wanton Mee stall has moved into a bigger unit (but thankfully still within the same coffeeshop).\n\nAlso, a new Western stall with value-for-money food (e.g. $5 for chicken chop fried rice) has appeared.",

      "text": "Took away Hokkien Mee & CKT for lunch. The wonderful aroma on my drive home just made me want to get home faster to eat! First, must say nowadays to be a hawker, a trend is pao kai liao- this stall sells 3 types of hokkien mee; 3 types of carrot cake; 6 types of paofan with choice of rice, maggie mee, mee sua or ee mee; CKT, fried mee tai bak and herbal chicken! and 24 hours. So i think perhaps one reason why such mixed reviews for hokkien mee must there’s more than one chef manning the stove.\n\nAnyway my CKT with extra $2 cockles had very strong wok hei. despite the 15min drive it was still piping hot (a bit sad that made the cockles shrink so much). i ordered with chili but it wasnt spicy. The redeeming feature for the signature hokkien mee was the very generous sprinkle of fried lard (you have to request for more which they were very happy to agree to). It was on the ‘wet’ side. The Simon Rd version at Telok Blangah tasted much better.\n\nStill, for a little store to offer so many choices (and there were many people eating in coffee shop from this stall), the 2 staff are doing a good job. Most people opt to go cashless using Paynow.",

Cooked by a Prc and u gona give him credit for being able to cook this standard of hkk mee.\nDefinitely not the best but reasonable.\nNice pork lard and fresh pork/prawns given.
