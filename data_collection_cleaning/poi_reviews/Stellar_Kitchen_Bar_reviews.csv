punyshark,4,"Nice to place dine-in before entering Singapore Science Centre! Pizza was awesome and freshly made though slightly soggy. Prices here are considered on the premium side, but as expected since this place is a tourist attraction. Service is decent but the restaurant itself is on the warmer side perhaps due to the hot weather today. Great pizza spot! üçï",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101852695494997424451/reviews
Kelvin Goh,5,"The pizza crust is so crispy and my kids love the super long cheese pull! Service from all the staff are exceptional, despite being very busy they are still very smiley. The manager helped honour the Tabsquare voucher I had even though he said actually it's a system glitch shouldn't apply to kids meal but he gave a goodwill anyway. Awesome!

Emily Ho,5,The place was crowded when we entered and the staff was kind to inform us that the wait will be 30mins and beyond. We went ahead anyway. The food actually came not too long after. The mushroom bacon pasta was good but can be more spicy. Spam fries were addictive and the pizzas were good too!

Capture Asia Photography,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here! While it is on the pricier side, the quality of the food and the cozy, decent-air-conditioned environment make it worth it. Everything was great! If I had to nitpick, offering free water would be a nice touch. üòä

Taste and service is always subjective. Definitely come back here to try other dishes if i visit Science Centre in near future. üëçüèª",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113796572659279486041/reviews
Xavier Ng,3,"We got the calamari, beef bolognese, and fish & chips!

Calamari was really good, crispy, hot, batter had decent spices and paired well with the dip.

Beef bolognese was a creamy tomato sauce that was surprisingly delicious! However felt that portion size did not really match the price point. & location does not really justify the prices here.

Fish & chips! We upgraded $2 to get truffle fries, & we were disappointed to have received room temperature fries that weren‚Äôt crispy (tasted good tho!) Fish was overcooked as it completely flaked with a touch of the fork. Veggies were alright.

Overall, a good hearty meal. Due to the prices that are not justified by portion nor location, we are unlikely to return. Thx for the meal!

P.S. we didn‚Äôt get to try the pizza at all (it has a lot of good reviews) so that might be a reason to return :)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107816105323448148983/reviews
