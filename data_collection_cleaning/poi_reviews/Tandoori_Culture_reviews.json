The chicken briyani was fantastic as the rice is fragrant and the chicken is really tender.\n\nGotta say the price tag is on the steeper side but the food is definitely quality! The service was also prompt and the male waiter is very friendly and helpful! I’m not the most well versed in Indian cuisine but this is a place I would come back in the future!",

All the dishes are good, and I think their portion is kinda generous too, the Kashmiri Pulao that is filled to the brim and with so many raisins and nuts!\nService staffs were friendly and attentive, the free pappadum is so tasty, coupled with the mint green sauce.\nWill definitely come back again! So glad that the Hillview area has plenty of Indian food option for us to indulge in!",
