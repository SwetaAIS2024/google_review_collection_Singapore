He was watching a video on his phone the whole session and had a very unfriendly and unapproachable tone. He shouted at me when I hesitated to answer a question and got mad when I was shaking during the check even though there was nothing I could do. Terrible doctor and human being, undeserving of the Dr. title and shouldn't be in any social service job.",
