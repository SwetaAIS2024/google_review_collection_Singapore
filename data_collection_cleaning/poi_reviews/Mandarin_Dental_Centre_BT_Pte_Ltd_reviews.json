I appreciated their gentle approach, especially since I tend to get nervous about dental work. Throughout the procedure, Dr Claudia made sure I was comfortable and constantly checked in to ensure I was at ease. Dr Claudia also took the time to explain the important steps required to ensure optimal post recovery.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Claudia she definitely earned my trust, and I'll be returning for all my future dental care needs.",

At the first visit, she had 2 teeth extracted n a filling for a third tooth. Dr gave a big discount. Today Dr had to extract the tooth as it was decayed. Dr did not charge her. We are very grateful for the kindness shown to our Myanmar migrant worker who has no resources. May God bless the doctors.",
