Everyone is like a family member and the pastors are all very approachable and caring. I love being here as I feel belong, calm and enjoy a good time with everybody here and with God. Do come by and be one of us or get to know us. You will feel welcomed and loved. Thanks",

Ask about the story behind the stained glass windows. Ask about what happened to the rubbish bin compound that used to be the \"frontage\" of AMKMC. Ask about their \"most successful\" pastor in charge.  And, most importantly, where have all the founder members gone.",

Unfortunately all my best class members ( cell groups  ) upon settling down have had no continued contacts and ultimately gone to other churches.  Needless to say we have matured as Christians and even spread the words of God via Bible and Ceremonial rites and counselling.",
