Ang zander,1,"I have been chasing payment from them for the past 6 months, the account did not pick up the phone call or on the line. Do not do business with them. Or better to go down to the office to ask for payment.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117777096069947631378/reviews
James Isaac,1,"This company is a shrewd company, it does not respond to sub contractors and does not even pay, i advise all people dealing with them to really take note of this company and try to stay far away from these dangerous and dishonest people. Speaking from a sub-contractor myself, this company did not respond and did not pay for works rendered.

I hope everyone can be warned. Thanks",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101915132611877958413/reviews
