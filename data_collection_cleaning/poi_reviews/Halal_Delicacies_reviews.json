The reason why i said it was hard for me cuz EVERY SINGLE TIME I HAD TO MAKE THIS REVIEW... Tom Yum bowl is empty... JIN MANE ENTAH DA KAUP GUA NYE TOM YUM LA  üëøüò¨ü§ê.. Sampai je trus tom yum hilang.. So JUST FOR TODAY! I tried locking my saka la dey.. Instead of buying SINGULAR bowl.. I just bought THE MEGA TOM YUM CHICKEN \"4pax\"  **WORTH IT\"*  took 2 boomerang snaps and choose this one instead edited a lil while eating this SUPER DELICIOUS SOUP.. You can definitely taste THAILAND in every slurrrrpppp la sehhhh..  Bought a couple of times and im more to a CHICKEN FAN than SEAFOOD.. They have both.. and i always ask for EXTRA spicy..  and it NEVER FAILS ME.. Legit NEVER EVEEEERRR FAIL ME...\n\nIf ya'll don't believe me.. Go and try for yourself... I am picky with my food for me to be super in love it.. PEOPLE WHO KNOWS ME.. THEY CAN TELL YA when i love it.. I SERIOUSLY WILL LOVE IT...\n\nSo MEGA TOM YUM CHICKEN which i opt for EXTRA SPICY.. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nTo the boss and lady boss  Shah Serba Boleh\n\nJgn jelak tgk ako dtg order tom yum eh... BARANG KETAGEH SIOL!!!\n\n#BarangBOEK\n#MakanSampaiSeleleh",
