      "text": "To Whome Concerns,\n\nI'm queries on few things that I always see  during the Clearence at Imigresen (2nd Link). Most of the time, I realised that more then 3/4 officers handling a single X-Ray machine.They will sit and having chit-chat and even not focus on screen. Do they know what they searching for actually? This custom building is having a very limited space for long queue and why the officers don't have alternative option to clear the bag checking process ?\n\nAs a Malaysian I'm worried, how the foreigners will look on this situation ? Do we in the Worst Imigresen System List on Earth ? Our imigresen system should be easy to everybody. Officer's must take initiative to clear the crowd. Same goes to Superior officers those on duty. Please do something when the crowd is big.\n\nPlease work together , show the world how superb is Malaysia Imigresen System  is doing. For the moment its not happening.\n\nOnly when Menteri give suprise visit the Clearence processes  become 5 star.\n\nPlease give your people a better quality and customer service .\n\nFrom,\nA Malaysian Who Concern On Our Nation Development And Good Name.",

Mind you, he is 6 year old.\n\nAbsolutely rude and some lacking basic decency is being allowed at a place like this is a disgrace and Malaysia should take some corrective actions on this.\n\nIf US immigration is toughest, Malaysia in my experience, has got be rudest. If this isnt the case in general and only with this individual(Amira) then she should be put through some basic trainings.",
