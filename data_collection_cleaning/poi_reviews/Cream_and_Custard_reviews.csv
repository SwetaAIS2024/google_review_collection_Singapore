Darryl Hamid,5,"Bought their cakes twice. (Lychee Rose and Strawberry Watermelon) Both times, the customer service was amazing, the cake came on time, in perfect condition and tasted absolutely incredible. The cakes were light and refreshing. My family and friends enjoyed it so much that there were no leftovers. Iâ€™ve recommended Cream and Custard to my friends and they too have enjoyed their experiences. The Strawberry Watermelon cake is definitely a MUST TRY! Will definitely be coming back for all my cake -needs!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113849438728991499190/reviews
CL C,5,"A great addition to the Telok Kurau neighbourhood! Staff are always welcoming and cheery. Our family members (kids and adults alike!) enjoyed their lychee rose cake and variety of hot dogs, which have a good bite, fresh and generous toppings, and are presented in a moreish brioche bun! The fruit iced tea was also very refreshing.

Looking forward to trying more of their bakes and celebrating more birthdays with their beautiful cakes.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109117373811020130859/reviews

Marianne,5,Ordered their cakes for many years and we really love their refreshing watermelon strawberry cake esp at its price point.  The galaxy cake is rich in chocolate and a kids favourite too. Visited their new store recently and delighted to know they serve small slices and drinks too! Service is great. Highly recommended to try :),in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118018604985403404203/reviews
Bihui Ong,5,"My first time ordering from cream and custard and I chose the Galaxy cake. It was such a delicious chocolate cake, moist and decadent but not sweet! The generous alcohol cherries took the flavours to the next level. And the cake itself is an artwork to marvel at! The marble glaze is amazing! Definitely ordering my next cake here.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100585387912854947970/reviews
