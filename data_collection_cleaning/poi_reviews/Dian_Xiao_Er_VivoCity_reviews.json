      "text": "The overall ambiance of the restaurant is delightful, and the beautiful decor at the entrance drew me in. I must say their herbal duck leg truly stands out from other places. The rich, juicy texture offers an unforgettable treat for the taste buds, with every bite infused with the aroma of herbs.\n\nThe stir-fried vegetables are also exceptionally crunchy and refreshing, though slightly heavier in flavor compared to other spots. However, the herbal chicken was less impressive—the meat was on the dry side. I’d definitely recommend going for the duck instead!",
