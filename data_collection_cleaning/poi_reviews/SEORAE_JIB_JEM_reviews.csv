Sam Lim,3,"Waited a few minutes for the staff to finish with her mobile phone messaging before we went in. No one bothered explaining the package set.

Side bar self service, sauces and kimchi.

Meat portion not much, pork too fat. Over price IMO.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105223893774165215809/reviews

Tracy Leong,5,"The pork are great. Ordered the port set signature menu and it’s definitely worth the money due to the quality and quantity of food. It comes with pork, soup and egg.

Attended by the staff, Felicia, who helped us to cook all our meat (this is a bonus point!!). She’s very friendly and attentive.

Love the whole experience here and would definitely be back.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106304150413906530257/reviews
Darryl Anthony Valino,3,"My wife and I had dinner here on a Saturday night at around 9 PM after shopping. We politely asked if they were still accepting customers since it was late. They welcomed us warmly, and the guy at the reception was very nice (he even took the time to explain a lot about the menu).

The food was great, especially the marinated pork, which was excellent. However, we found the service severely lacking. We tried calling for assistance with grilling, extra utensils, and sides (since they were closing soon, they had already removed the sides), but it was very difficult to get the attention of the waiters. At times, it felt like they were actively ignoring us. We eventually had to get up and approach the staff directly just to get the assistance we needed.

We understand that everyone was probably tired, and it was close to closing time. However, since they accepted us as customers and we still paid a service fee, we expected better service.

That said, we're still willing to give this restaurant another try since the food was pretty good.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106195013506881960935/reviews
