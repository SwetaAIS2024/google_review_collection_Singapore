Nochee Simon,5,"If you are crazy about karaoke then you should go here. The sound system is good but just two comments, you guys should add more song choices especially Indonesian songs hehe. And also the Aircond is a bittttt hot. The atmosphere is good for families so it is recommended if you want to bring your kids.
