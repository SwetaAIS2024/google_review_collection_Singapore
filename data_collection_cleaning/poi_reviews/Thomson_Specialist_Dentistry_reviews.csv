Kalvin Toh,5,"Was recommended by a client to Thomson Specialist Dentistry for my daughter’s braces treatment. Dr Low Hwee Hiang quoted reasonably for the course of treatment and was tentatively slightly below from all the rest of the dentist clinics I enquired. Highly recommended Dr Low as she meticulously handled my daughter’s teeth and over a period of 2 years monthly visit, my daughter teeth is beautifully straightened and face shape changed. Also to highlight admin Gigi Tan whom have help me with adjusting the appointments which is so important for my busy schedules, and my girl’s school. Overall, highly recommended Thompson Specialist Dentistry for your dental needs for their professionalism and personalized services.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114707071306659594941/reviews
