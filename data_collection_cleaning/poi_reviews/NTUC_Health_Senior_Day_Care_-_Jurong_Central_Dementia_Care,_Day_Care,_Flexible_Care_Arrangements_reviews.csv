Calista Jo,5,"My dad Mr Elangovan has been in this day care for almost 10 years until he passed on peacefully recently. He had since second stroke and was retired since his accident at age 47. He lost his communication and understanding abilities...became a child...we had to send him to the elder care centre so that his mind will be occupied and we all had to go work...as he got older he was diagnosed with dementia and sumtimes he can get moody and aggressive..but he was well taken care of with no complaints....Ms Siti always gives me feedbacks on my dad and his behaviours at the central...but she and all staffs were always patient, understanding and humble. She also shares and sends me pictures of their activities together. We were at peace working knowing he was being taken care of well by the centre. I'm sure he wud missed all of his gd time there. The centre has became a memory for us❤️ my dad's good moments spent there.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108539059382101537633/reviews
