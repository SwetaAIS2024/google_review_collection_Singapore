Victor Lim,4,"Always enjoyed having my Low Fat Vanilla Latte at Starbucks.

OTH is a good location with friendly staff.

It can get a bit crowded during weekends and school breaks when students are studying and enjoying food and drinks.

I like the setting and feel tranquil as most are respectful of the students studying (I guessing) and do not speak too loudly.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108789096091155395479/reviews

Isabelle Tay,4,"Very cosy starbucks outlet even though it can get really crowded. Some seats were too close to each other though, so really depends where u get.

Standard is there so nothing much to comment!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104140455507701408773/reviews

Panna Metta,3,Tried the expensive $8.90 chocolate lava cake. The chcolate flavour is not strong enough and it is overly sweet. The cake is very dense and not moist. Not worth $8.90. Other bakeries sell better cakes.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113331481375789850945/reviews
