Derrick Chong,1,"Avoid at all cost.

Price on the board was $20 but if asked for Fade cut there is a $5 surcharge. The fade cut was done and thatâ€™s it - no other part of my hair was cut apart from the side. Very unprofessional without checking with client whether they want to trim the hair.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111807894317249492248/reviews
Liane Amante,1,"Paid almost 200 and promised a rebond + keratin + cellopane.

Been 6 years going for rebond and done it myself twice also. The new staff lied. I paid extra than what i usually pay here for rebond, and did not get any treatment. The new staff said that the fixing part of my rebond (the one they put to straigthen my hair) is the keratin.

I know keratin, i know rebond. I felt more embarassed for him and could not correct him. I left the salon not feeling good but more than feeling bad about myself. Also my hair did not get rebonded like the results others did for 6 years. He said it's a different rebond. Why? It was my worst exp here and first time paying that much. Should not have trusted the new staff's sales talk.

He also doesnt know how to cut hair ðŸ˜”
We need to go to other salon to have it fixed.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104509941067208186278/reviews
Sharkbait In New England,5,"I came this real nice spot for a pedicure and foot scrub.  Wow, did my specialist do so good!  You should have seen how much dead skin she was able to scrape off.  Also, the pedicure she did was on point!  Safe, sanitary,  and punctual.  Make sure you ask for Mai; she the friendly girl there who took care of me!  Attached video of her taking great care of me!  I am here for a few months and will go to her for my foot & hand care.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107665945823987994499/reviews
Jean Morales,1,"I was decide to do my hair in level 4 belisse beauty sanctuary, i do not recommend this salon for anyone  as u can see the rating here determine how bad the staff was, they are very rude in term of behavior  , when iron my hair i feel like burning sensation on my scalp, as a customer we came their salon for treatment to pamper our hair , if you complain they are angry and end up arguement towards the customer given us a face of an angry mad woman...

feromina,1,"Worst salon experience in Singapore. I dont recommend to anyone. I normally go to their neighbors salon every week but because they were full of customers so I came here. WAS NIGHTMARE. The Auntie who ironned my hair keep on pulling my hair and said how ugly my hair and how I need this that treatment. Until I said ""stop you hurting me"" then she slowed down. Also they lied about the price they said on the board $15 for ironing and when I paid it become $25, Auntie insisted that my hair so thick. When I paid with PayNow I come to know that they belong the same owner where I normally go and charge for $15 every time. I will never come back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102391651442714747511/reviews
