Mizi Fathillah,5,"Great school environment at Adventure Tree for my child with lots of outdoor and open area

Teachers are caring and responsive to the children’s needs. The curriculum blends learning with play and is very well-rounded with lots of outdoor activities. My child especially enjoys water play!

Ms Morgane is also highly involved in the running of the school and so approachable at all times.

Happy to have sent our child here as its been an enriching and fulfilling journey for her and us as parents!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108254979736388552940/reviews
Charis C,5,"been here since my son was an infant and he’s in PG now. teachers are engaging, ambience is cosy, and environment in the neighbourhood is nice. i love that outdoor water play and walks to the park/playground opposite the school are part of their regular programming, and the class sizes are small which means every child is engaged thoroughly. the children here are sweet and friendly too, which reflects a holistic education the staff provides (ie not just language and math but also manners and social skills). thank you Ms Morgane, Ms Karen and all the infant & PG teachers.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109229899226809632332/reviews
