Diana Tan,2,"Very unpleasant experience. Not one to come too if there are other options available and unless one doesn‚Äôt mind being disregarded. Came because the only other option would be going to the A&E since we needed a doctor in the wee hours.

There were 2 staff at registration. The more experienced staff was rude, the other one was at best indifferent. Both were clearly unable to empathize with patients who had to seek help from a 24-hour clinic.

Doctor did the necessary checks. Minimal eye contact, empathy and was clinical. Line of questioning does not instill confidence in patients.

When medication was dispensed, brief information was given. Wouldn‚Äôt even call it ‚Äúchecking things off the list‚Äù.

Paid more than $200 for visit.

The only positive point about visiting was the ability to see a doctor quickly since there were no other patient and we were able to obtain medication quickly.

Hopefully at the end of enduring such behavior, the medication works and helps.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117431277064598154954/reviews
rykelle new,1,"Went to this clinic on a PH and was told consult was  $135 before medication and GST charges. At first, thought the price was okay as it was a PH. To my horror, the consult was less than 1 minute long. Went into treatment room and was asked about my condition. After sharing, was told"" ok u can wait outside"". No explanation or any concerns to my conditions at all. While waiting for medication and bill, 5 numbers after me was called. Just imagine the 5 patient going in and out of the tretament room in less than 10 mins. For the duration of the consult and the unprofessional attitude given by the doctor, its should be $10 instead. Receptionist was monotoned and looks like walking dead. No expression and not professional at all. If not in the mood to work (doctor/recptionist), just go home. Dont waste everyones time. Total bill went up to $172.üò±üò±  Overall, dont even deserve a star for such service. Even polyclinic could do better.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108389125174021852002/reviews
Stanley Ng,1,"I had a very disappointing experience with Dr. Loh AZH of this clinic. From the moment I walked into the room, I felt unwelcome. The doctor‚Äôs attitude was very bad, and there was no effort to listen to my concerns. When I tried to explain my symptoms, I was interrupted, and the doctor seemed uninterested in understanding the full scope of my health issues. There was absolutely no empathy or compassion, which made me feel as though my well-being didn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs important for a doctor to make their patients feel heard and cared for, but unfortunately, I did not experience that here. I would not recommend this doctor or clinic to anyone looking for compassionate and attentive care.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114613788401066637110/reviews
Amy San,1,"I encountered a very unwelcoming environment during my visit. The counter staff carelessly tossed my IC on the counter after registration. Additionally, there were cobwebs on the ceiling, and the overall cleanliness was quite lacking. The doctor‚Äôs attitude was also disappointing; she barely spoke to me and did not conduct a thorough examination before prescribing medication. I had to wait an excessively long time for the doctor to arrive. I will not be returning.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107741638222941597764/reviews
Michelle HweeTeng,1,"My girl and myself had soar throat and running nose so we decided to visit this Clementi Clinic. While registering, the counter staff already had some unhappiness with the patients infront us. So we were so unlucky to had a ‚Äúbad conversation ‚Äú with her.
Doctor attended to us was nice and friendly. So overall it took less than 5mins to see both of us. And our consultation cost $45 each so total cost for both of us $165/-‚Ä¶this is too overpriced for usüòì. I will never visit this clinic in future‚Ä¶too expensive for normal flu.üòì",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108539787233229443059/reviews
