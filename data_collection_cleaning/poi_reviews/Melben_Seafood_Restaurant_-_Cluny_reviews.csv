DaX Toh,4,"Located in a stand alone foodcourt near botanic gardens. Creamy butter crab was delicious! An 850g crab for 2 pax was just the right amount. Felt very satisfied after devouring every strand of meat, with a generous amount of gravy to dip in. Most important was that the crab was extremely fresh and plump full of flesh, unlike many other places where the crab flesh might be sparse, or much smaller than the shell etc. Will definitely return!!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110795556109846185546/reviews
Sihan Goi,5,"Awesome zi char at a quiet place. Been here 3x and so far it hasn't disappointed. Silver fish fried rice, chicken chunks fried rice were both both. Salted egg pork ribs were also a crowd pleaser. Hokkien mee was however not the usual Hokkien mee so we didn't enjoy it as much. Spent about $20+ per pax. Everyone enjoyed the good. Ambience is like a food court but not as crowded as others. Service was good as well.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101606206460809087168/reviews
M Antonio C,4,"Some of the best food that I've had on my trip.   I've been all throughout Chinatown, Little India, downtown, and more.
Everywhere, the food has been amazing.  But the food this evening on New Years Eve 2024 was wonderful.
We ordered the Marmite Ribs.  Amazing!!!  Then, the salt and pepper chicken wings.  Wow.... so good.  We also ordered Chili Crab.  Fantastic!  Pricey but really good.
We also had beef chow fun and choy.....
Highly recommended.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104838312111607953395/reviews
Joyce Lim,5,"Excellent silver fish fried rice and so cheap at sgd7. Salted egg pork ribs was tender and flavoursome, ok portions, and sauce was not too jelat. Horfun wasn't fantastic, passable. Hokkien mee is not the typical kind, it's the dark soy sauce type. Overall a very good meal. 5 stars for fried rice n pork ribs. 4 stars for other dishes weren't fantastic. Ambience was very good, an upmarket air-conditioned food court with plenty of seats on Sunday at 6pm. Will be back soon to try other dishes.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114306834103372851451/reviews
Lenon Tan,5,"Excellent chinese-style seafood. Restaurant standard in an air-conditioned foodcourt.

Food was top quality. Egg floss on deep-fried prawns was interesting, tasted like sweet pork floss, prawns so crunchy like cereal prawns. I wish fresher prawns could be used. Broccoli and mushrooms were stir-fried just right, not overcooked, chewy and flavourful.

Service level was good and fast.

Environment was nice, surrounded by botannical gardens.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108531854195491062188/reviews
