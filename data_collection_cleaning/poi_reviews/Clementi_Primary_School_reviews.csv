Ling,5,"My kid is in Grade2 now, through more than one year study here, i find clementi primary school is a very good school with many kind and caring teachers. The principal is very wise and humble, he trained kids to learn to service and use their talents in many ways .  BTW, my kid loves aquarium in school üòÇÔºåcause it‚Äôs very healing , good for their mental health.

( But I hope school can change the fans in classroom, as it seems too heavy wind not so comfortable, can change them to some mild fan, thanks üôè )",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106775378500331807127/reviews
Angeline Ng,3,"For those who have booked the school badminton court and wondering what is a possible route to the venue, one way is to park at the HDB blocks and then walk on the pavement along Clementi ave 6. The gate to the badminton hall is via the gate to the soccer field. Otherwise, you will have to walk past a big grass patch and it is not a pleasant experience on a rainy day. The Clementi school badminton hall is side by side with the Clementi secondary school badminton hall.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100467172893917985684/reviews
JamesDH Ng,4,"As an ex clemention. I guess the school is average.There is a competition called league of champions and if u are of the 6 winning classes (p1-6)u get a free buffet. Very fun over the 4 terms and a lot of activities. Teachers are very good especially my form teachers(Ms Yeo and ms er) and DM very reasonable.the only negative I don‚Äôt like is the combine level for canteen for the upper levels, we will have shorter recess since many of the lower primary class is released earlier than the upper primary but overall good school üëç",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113546866969433268978/reviews

Muhd Sadiq,1,"The new principal sucks. He made many unnecessary changes to the school such as merging recess time of 2 level together, adding an aquarium in the canteen and replacing the bright vibrant red curtains with a boring shade of Navy blue. Genuinely one if the worst leadership I've seen in my life from an adult. I could write another detailed paragraph on why the other rules he changed sucks but I have better things to do with my time. As long as Mr Vimal stays in the school PLEASE NEVER let a child in there. However I must say there are many good teachers in the school",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106518215407549440775/reviews
