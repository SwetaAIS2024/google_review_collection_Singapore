SHL Soh,5,"This NUH children medical centre is nicely decorated and very child friendly. Short waiting time from registration to triage. Doctors,  staffs, Physiotherapist are good, helpful and friendly. A special mention goes to Dr Lawrence Wang, an experienced and details doctor who serves with heart. Doctor Wang will listen to you very attentively and never rush you through the appointment. He will do his best to treat my son and tried to allocate his time to see him before his overseas trip and we really appreciate his help. We had good experiences with KTP medical centre and we hope KTP will continue to provide quality medical services to the children.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116989690134541964256/reviews
