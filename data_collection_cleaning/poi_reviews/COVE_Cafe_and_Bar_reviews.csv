T L,5,"Super nice vibes! Service staff were really friendly too.

Got some bites and drinks. Chicken wings were tasty and flavourful. Chicken fried rice was very good! A bit oily but super fragrant. La zi ji and fried mushrooms were addictive, while lychee prawn balls were bouncy. The tea pot cocktail was nice with a good alcohol ratio.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105491523268870269764/reviews
Eric ChuaHL,1,"Location is walking distance from Maxwell mrt station , do not know why google search mentioned it is @ Chinatown Point ? cafe has average setting outlook

Picked up a $20 voucher ( expiring by today 3/2/25) - friend went over to claim but was rejected as cafe do not honour it

The term condition is that they can anyhow change the rule - bad shop , wasting time ,and effort to go over for voucher redemn.
In the end , they gift a consolation free drink to compensate for the long distance travelling

Avoid this cafe , if you do not want to spoil your happy mood dinning or drinking .",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110012238744023046182/reviews
