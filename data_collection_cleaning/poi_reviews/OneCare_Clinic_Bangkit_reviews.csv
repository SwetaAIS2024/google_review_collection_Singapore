Sidharth Bairy,1,"This place is daylight robbery. I asked the receptionist when I came in (on a public holiday) if the consultation fee was the usual $20, but she didn't give me a straight answer. I had a common cold, so I didn't require any medications, and the fee was an insane $54.50, just for a consultation to get a day of sick leave. This is appalling behavior from the counter staff, deliberately withholding the PH surcharge until after I'd finished the consultation. And this isn't my first such experience with this clinic either.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110735140677857578430/reviews
