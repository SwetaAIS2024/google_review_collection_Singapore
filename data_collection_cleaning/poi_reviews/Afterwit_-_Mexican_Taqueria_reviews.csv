Nugi Mugi,5,"Had the burrito bowl. It was great. Really love the rice seasoning. The nachos that came with it was pretty oily and dry. Would be nice with cheese.

My friend had nachos which was amazing and big portions. Will have that again.

The Quesadilla was nice but small portions.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107397424699014411487/reviews
One Zero ._.,4,"We booked a table in advance and arrived at the restaurant about 15 mins early. The staff assigned us a table immediately. The service was okay; staff were able to address our needs and apologised when they forgot to serve our drinks. Ordered a taco and quesadilla, both of which tasted great. We also ordered a Berry Mint drink and another beverage. We liked how the drinks were presented, but we’re not a fan of their taste. The environment was quiet and suitable for chatting.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108811248424222737193/reviews
dessy danggraini,4,"If you crave for halal mexican food, I recommend to go this place and try their tacos. Their Nachos is delicious. However I found the wing chickens were too tangy for me. Delicious but tangy, the tabasco taste were so strong. Different spicy level. Anyway it was just my taste.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107493991791938924199/reviews
Jack Frost,5,"Really love the decor, it really screams out Mexico vibes with all the posters and red lights. Food wise, would recommend the platter. Shared it with my partner and we were so full at the end. Recommend the Tabasco Mango drink, gets spicier from the Tabasco when you leave it out for long…love it!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104353328197481070965/reviews
One Random Person,4,"Made a reservation for 2. it was quite full, so we were assigned to a 2 seater table, alot of food in the menu were out of stocks. We were left with little choices. we ordered a tapas platters and the spicy wings. The cold brew tea was nice.

Lamb tapas was the tastiest among the jackfruit, chicken and fish tapas.

Spicy wings tasted like normal wing. nothing special.

the staffs were friendly and helpful.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115249615192995883382/reviews
