Kelvin Ngo,5,"Many vegetarian selections, with several using dynameat, a brand of meat analogues. We ordered delivery to our home as the restaurant is far away from us.

Loved everything we tasted! They exceeded our expectations and were full of flavours without being overly salty. The texture of dynameat elevated the dining experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108938050734323740126/reviews

Time : 8.30 pm

First time ordering at this stall.
Ordered fried olive rice and crab meat omelette, priced at $6 and $15 respectively.

Portions pretty generous. Taste a bit salty for both. Olive rice not too much of olives.
Couldn‚Äôt finish both portions for 2 of us.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116788322544213433170/reviews
Josephine,5,"Their curries and tom yum paste are made from scratch with fresh herbs and ingredients. Our favorites, the Green Curry and Tom Yum were so irresistible that we had to take some home! Their basil with rice is a definite must-try! Even their stir-fries hit the spot and our kids love their Pad Thai so much that they asked for second helping. Every dish is well spiced and bursting with flavours, seriously delicious!

All dishes under the vegetarian menu can be veganised and made alliums free!

Goh ‚Äúkaide23‚Äù Khai Tee,5,"This shop newly moved here to Taman Jurong foodcourt, and the Thai food is delicious.
The glass noodle salad is epicly delicious, authentic and spicy.
The beef noodle is nice but if you don't like salty then I can't say anything.
The garlic pork is ok, normal for me as I can't taste very strong garlic taste as I prefer a lot of garlic.
The grill pork is epic, tender and full of taste.
The sticky rice mango is perfect!

Total spend around $45ish for 2 person meal. Which for me it is worth it as the food is nice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102268420175632373756/reviews
