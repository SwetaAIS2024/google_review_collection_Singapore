Clarence Tan,3,"Tried Paik’s Noodles for the first time. The jjamppong was underwhelming — the soup tasted quite flat and reminded me of instant noodle seasoning. The jjajjangmyeon was slightly better; the noodles were decent, but the sauce also had that seasoning-packet feel.

Portion-wise, we had two noodle dishes and five dumplings, which came up to nearly $30 — not exactly value for money. Might consider eating here again if nearby and have no other options, but it’s not going to be a go-to spot. Have tasted better options elsewhere",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103103346175823755937/reviews
Wendy Rusli,3,Ordered mapo tofu w rice and one gochu yurinyuk. Side dishes given were very pathetic (just 3 radish slices with one drop of bean paste and 2 slice of onions). Food taste was average for the price $45. Wouldn't come back again.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113018119807321670785/reviews
Daniel Wong,5,"Came here for jjajangmyeon which I am a fan since my first trip to Korea in 1997. This is one of a few restaurants in SG that meet my standard of a good Korean jjajangmyeon. Most important, the noodles must be QQ and the black bean sauce is thick and tasty. My son had the fried rice with jjajang sauce. The short grain fried rice was good enough to be eaten on it's own. My son liked it even better with the sauce.
Note: You order at the counter and as we came at opening time, the only staff outside the kitchen was still busy with the opening so had to wait awhile before ordering. Water is available, self service. The restaurant is rather quiet despite its location outside NTUC Fairprice.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115145949078497107987/reviews
CHOLE Tang,4,"Came here for dinner and was surprised by the small crowd. However, I was shocked at the portions. The jjajang myeon didn't reallybhave a bouncy texture, but the sauce was more umami and it's isn't as sweet or a salty compared to other places. And the serving was huge! The shrimp fried rice was quite good with the sauce, and it still tasted like fried rice since it didn't get overwhelmed by the sauce. The tang suyuk was delicious. You can ask to separate the sauce if you aren't a fan of too much sauce bit the sauce itself was tangy and not too strong. The chicken however, although a bit stiff, was very fragrant by itself. I recommend giving this place a try!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114642132578006423922/reviews
Cel,1,"Keep hearing kitchen staff hawking mucous of his throat (just like those people you hear them before spitting out their mucous collected at the back of throat)
Disgusting
Restaurant management pls do something.
Feel like vomiting as I heard it while eating.

Atmosphere is more like a Chinese restaurant with Chinese songs playing loud enough for all the guests to hear.
Mussels 1/10 size of its shells
Overall , tried once enough",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113232945603184594918/reviews
