      "text": "I think their herbal chicken soup is done better than their turtle soup. Don't get me wrong, the turtle soup is decent, but far from great. It was light on the turtle meat, though they cooked it til it's soft, and the cartilage / joints were nice to chew on. However, the taste of the soup is too light, bordering on the blander side.\n\nNot my favourite, but OK in a pinch. It's in a hawker centre, so don't expect an upscale ambience or anything. But they do close early, so maybe they do have a steady stream of customers.",
