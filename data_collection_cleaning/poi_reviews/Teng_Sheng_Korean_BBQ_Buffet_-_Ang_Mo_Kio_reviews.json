      "text": "Reached the place around 12.25pm this afternoon. The place is crowded and was informed to pay first before the service staff directed us to a table and set up the bbq. The buffet counter includes meat stuff like pork, beef, chicken and seafood like sotong, prawns and others like luncheon meat, endoki mushroom, lettuce, pickled raddish, kimchi, etc. Various sauces like special chilli sauce, korean sauce, ketchup, etc are also provided. There is kimchi soup and kelp soup, cut fruit watermelon and a small section of fried food like fried fish dory, fries, fried chicken, fried dumpling. However, the fried food are cold. Drink section included a variety of cold drinks like barley, lemon, orange, etc. Overall, food is satisfactory considering the price is reasonable at $18 per person for weekday lunch. Price is $22 for dinners, weekends and public holiday. There is no time limit for the buffets.",

Food quality is average/poor (can see some of the meats semi cooked, probably from defrosting?) It's hit and miss. The other items are okay, reasonable for the pricing. Okay to visit again, not missing much not to.",
