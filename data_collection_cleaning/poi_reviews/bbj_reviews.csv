Evan W,4,"A cozy bar with pool table and darts room.
Wide range of drinks available.
Food is surprisingly good, esp the pork belly.

Service was favored towards regulars with smiles, while new faces seems kinda awkward between conversation.

Music was a bit too loud but the song selections were good.
Sufficient parking.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117135828276011095737/reviews
Marc Singh,5,"we had both the beef and pork burgers and they were both fantastic and of great quality, especially considering the low price point! there’s a wide array of bar bites and you’ll literally be spoilt for choice. loved the spicy tofu and the pork slab, they were both really good too. my favourite item was definitely the beef burger - the same sized and same quality burger will cost you at least double the price elsewhere, so this place is definitely very wallet friendly!

can’t wait to be back for beers and more bar bites!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111474566471418870196/reviews
Alexis Cheong,5,"A 5-star through and through! Service was great, the alfresco area's dog friendly (though the bosch building carpark isn't so gotta walk around it). But our dog got a bowl of iced water upon moments of being seated. Just that the outside area is self serve but we get notified of the food and drinks being ready quickly.

The food is good and well priced too - the burger is just phenomenal. I appreciated the zero free alcohol as well. Inside, it was cooler and has a family friend bar pub vibe. What a great gem in the neighbourhood.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104658918419134607489/reviews
Kevin Ang,5,"Amazing burger bar tucked away in the Bosch building. It’s got a sports bar feel with many screens showing sports as well as pool table and darts. Drinks are plenty and reasonably priced. Food during nights feature burgers, bar bites and an awesome condiment bar. They seem to serve local food during daylight hours.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247294128726535324/reviews
