Probably a little spicy for some palate\n\nThe service was a bit slow. Maybe because they are popular in the evenings.\n\nThe ambience is very average. Sitting outside is good in the evenings with nice cool breeze.\n\nThe price is reasonable too. Would recommend this restaurant if one is in Changi Business Park neighborhood",

One pack of keerain, potato/beans and another potato which is served with poori. Is this what you serve to take out customers ? Why has the food quality deteriorated so bad ? I am sure it’s way better when we dine in. Very bad experience. Never patronising again",
