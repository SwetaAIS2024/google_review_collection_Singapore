Vienna,5,"A long walk park under the HDB, very convenient for the residents nearby. Very good place for fitness and running. But I guess once the new HBD finished, the park should be more crowded.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103415808392827589559/reviews

Rick To,4,"Great inner city walking and running path.  If pedestrians didn't need to cross over too many roads, then it would've been perfect.

The great thing is though, is that you can walk all the way down to marina bay.  I think the paths are wide enough and generally well lit at night.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108075038011736055921/reviews
