Portion of ingredients was good too, not stingy! Two thumbs up!\n\nUpdate Aug 2024\nNo longer flat rate but slight increase in price. $4/$5 now. Last pic is $5 portion.\nTastes as good!

Smack in the middle of a quiet coffeeshop is this nondescript stall without a name, but a sign that simply describes what they sell. It's run by a very nice elderly couple too.\n\nOk. My first litmus test for good CKT....Must Have Pork Lard! Ticked. Must Have Sweet Sauce! Ticked! Must have Wok Hei! Ticked.\n\nNow you get a plate of sweet, dark kway teow, coated with garlic and egg strands, strewn with crispy pork lard on request, and chilli that isn't quite obvious visually, but bite into it, and you know it's there.\nThey use 'Hum'; those tiny ones used in pasta sometimes, and they give enough taste without the overkill from those large ones (works for me actually!).\n\nIf you love your CKT a little ok the sweet side, then you Must try theirs.\n\nI have My go-to places for CKT, and I just added this one to my very short listðŸ˜˜",
