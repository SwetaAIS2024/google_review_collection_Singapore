When I asked her if she could check if she still had another of my parcel she started screaming at me saying it's not her problem and that I was in the wrong. I tried explaining to her but she just started screaming at me more. Shoppe shows the parcel has been collected and I've double checked my items. Some serious attitude problems.",
