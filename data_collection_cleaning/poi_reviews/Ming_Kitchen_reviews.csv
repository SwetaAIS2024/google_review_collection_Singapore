Joshua Chee,1,"So rude. I understand that you have every rights to have your break as an employee but put it nicely. Just telling me no more, everything also don't have rudely does not help me understand what is your point. Why can't you just put a sign be back at 4.30pm? Or tell me nicely that your staffs are all resting together and the stall is not operational?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108888229027820656248/reviews
Hungry BuiBui,2,Had zichar here twice and both times left feeling disappointed.. Fish wasn't that fresh and tasted a little fishy but still acceptable given the price of it. The other dishes were somewhat below avg too with little and small ingredients that were not really fresh.. The only saving grace was that the fish on discount was cheap.. $13.80 for the hk style steamed and around $15 for the assam fish but it's on limited time promo.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104557219367034893439/reviews
Esmond Chun,3,"First time tried since the coffee shop just reopen on couple of weeks ago.
We have ordered our common must try dishes like 漁香茄子煲，虾酱鸡和煎排骨日式。
Prawns paste chicken is OK as it served hot and could get the smell and right taste that we are expecting. As for brinjal also taste good but very unfortunate is they doesn't serve with claypot, the fire is still on when it serve and turn out the base becoming too dry.
As for the pork ribs I think it is just OK and no special, they even charging higher price on standard local pork ribs, as could see the plate is full of sauce. Not worth to try it.
Overall, can take a try and we might be return to try their other dishes.
1 Feb: we ordered the 什錦河粉and什锦福建面。
什錦河粉 just find OK but you will not get the woh hey.
什锦福建面 standard is a bit losing as too watery.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113754482951461644092/reviews

Ken Lim,1,"DO NOT COME HERE FOR REUNION DINNER

Came here with my extended family for our reunion dinner. Utterly disappointed by the food, as we paid a pretty steep sum. It's obvious that the food was just reheated and not fresh. The server also told us that the chefs have all stopped working at 5 pm and had left for Malaysia. The entire kitchen was empty.

There's no white rice, no teh / kopi, no additional standalone tze char dishes. My dad is vegetarian and he has to go to 7 Eleven to get some preheated vegetarian food.

Maybe on normal days their food would be better, when the chefs are here. But considering the amount paid for the reunion dinner, I had expected better food and service. Don't offer packages but give your customers food that was prepared earlier and just reheat it for them.

Utterly disappointing. While I do empathize with the chefs who need to return to Malaysia, I would rather the stall not offer such packages at the expense of their staff and customers.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110215837159476702709/reviews
