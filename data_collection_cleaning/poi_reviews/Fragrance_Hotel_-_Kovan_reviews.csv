Nur Syakila,1,Leena the receptionist extremely rude over the call I informed about the hotel room aircon was hot suggested me other alternative she said it was “ too late “ and there won’t be half of the refund even expected us to change the room when there was less than 20mins to check out for a 4 hours I told her it is not logical. As soon as we entered we were tired and knocked out and woke up sweating. DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL as their hotel is poorly managed maintenance she also agreed and sabotaged herself telling me over the call “ sure you can do a bad review “ also to mention her colleague went to check the aircon too. Will be also talking to cassie the manager over the update on this matter.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101183116551638510144/reviews
HC Denton,5,"This hotel is very nice. The room was very clean, housekeeping is immaculate, every day the towels etc. are changed when necessary and they treat your belongings very respectfully. The front desk is staffed 24/7 and they are also very friendly, helpful and professional.

The hotel is located in Singapore's heartland, between the Kovan and Serangoon MRT stations. You can walk to either of them easily or take a bus there, the bus station is right in front of the hotel. Behind the hotel is a convenient spot to wait for Gojek, Grab etc. A self service laundry is nearby. The Heartland mall and a hawker centre are also nearby where you have so many options to have breakfast, lunch and dinner if you like. The people in the area are extremely friendly and it's a very calm and relaxing area.

Two small issues: 1., standard rooms don't have windows, so on my first day here I woke up at 12:30 PM only =) Then I set an alarm clock. Not having a window does take some getting used to, but when you're outside all day anyway that's no problem. 2., the shower head is fixed, which is a bit inconvenient.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110192298778157303377/reviews

Valardohaeriz,5,"I love this hotel, it's fantastic for solo travelers. I almost feel like I shouldn't review it because then more people will find and book the hotel thus it might get sold out when I need it (afterall it's a small 4-storey hotel). All amenities are simple but complete. Rooms are clean and well maintained. Cleaning service comes daily to replace tea & coffee. Best of all, the price is very affordable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115271685767414616568/reviews
