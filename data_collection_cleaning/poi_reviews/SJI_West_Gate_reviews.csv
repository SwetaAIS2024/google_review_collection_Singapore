秦泞,5,"Professional Coaches and Great Learning Experience!
I highly recommend SITA Tennis Academy! My child joined their tennis training program as a beginner and has shown remarkable improvement over time. The coaching team is extremely professional, patient, and certified. They tailor the lessons based on each student's skill level, which made a big difference.

The program is well-structured, balancing technical skill development with fun activities to keep students engaged and motivated. The facilities are also excellent, providing a comfortable and safe environment for training.

Special thanks to the coaching team for their dedication and guidance, helping my child not only improve their tennis skills but also develop discipline and teamwork. Overall, a fantastic experience that I would recommend to anyone looking to learn or advance in tennis!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109952070157022345299/reviews
