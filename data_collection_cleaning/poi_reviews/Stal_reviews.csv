Peregrine Brumfit,5,"Lovely venue, the owner was kind and patient with us when trying to book the place. Was very helpful during the whole process, and continued throughout the night which we hired the place. The facilities were great, sauna pool, and gym, allowing everyone to have a great time!

Judee T,4,"Responsive admin who answered me quickly before I panicked, and gave good advice how to maximise the space. Sufficient space for my people (about 30 ish). Room temperature just nice. Good caterer had enough space to set up. Most attendees are amused by the big figurines hahaha. Having your speaker sit on the monster bike to present is also a mood. We also rented the pool which is clean. Pool area has more than enough space for 25 of us. Maybe because of the previous night’s party, the room floor felt sticky. Overall good place to make an impression. 4/5.

Beronica Mohanan,5,"Stal is amazing. It’s unique and clean. There’s a washroom sink and fridge in the unit itself. The host is super accommodative and helpful.

All the guests were amused by the huge statues.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104496170597025375458/reviews
