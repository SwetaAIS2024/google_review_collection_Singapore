The dried chilli frog is good; generous w the sauce, alight spicy kick, frog is well cooked. but the porridge was a little more watery than those thick kinds that leave your lips sticky (as it should be). Overall, decent neighbourhood meal.\n\nCame back here a second time to try the beef hor fun. Weird cause they add onions inside for the black bean hor fun. Don't recommend, no wok hey also.",

Stall is located in a windy location, great with unblock view along the main road. Not many coffee shops can match this. Recommended food are Curry Fish Head, Sambal Petai Fried Rice, Curry Pork Rice, French Beans with Dry Shrimps, Fried Spare Ribs",
