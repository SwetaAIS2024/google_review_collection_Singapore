URGENT Email,4,Chance upon this halal YTF and was pleasantly surprise by it. The items are relatively fresh and big given that 80 cents per pc. Quite a number of items without fish paste but it's ok for me. I had it with dry beehoon and I'm delighted to see fried shallot in oil available.  It was crispy and went well with the chilli sauce for my dry beehoon. Comfort food for me.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117143276286960523843/reviews
