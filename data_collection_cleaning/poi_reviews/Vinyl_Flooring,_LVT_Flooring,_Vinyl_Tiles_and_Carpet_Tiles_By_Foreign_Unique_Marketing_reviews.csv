Mark Chen,5,"Foreign unit marketing has very competitive vinyl floor prices. Vincent their boss is a very patient and down to earth man who clarified many of my queries. They do not have fancy showrooms like Evorich, but their warehouse is pretty large.

He is a traditional man who does not know how to do advertising on social media. So when I couldn't find any reviews of this company I had lots of doubts. But he patiently addressed many of them and even arranged a site visit to one of his residential projects. When I spoke to the house owner who said it was his second time doing vinyl flooring Vincent, I was more assured. I would do vinyl flooring with them in the future",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108464387545046931770/reviews
