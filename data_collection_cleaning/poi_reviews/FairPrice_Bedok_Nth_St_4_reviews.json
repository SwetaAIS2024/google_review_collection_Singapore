Bear in mind that it gets crowded here, because of the high population density of the area. To make things worse the aisles are quite narrow as with many HDB estate fairprices. I would recommend visiting during off-peak, which is easy because this is a 24 hour fairprice.",

I have given feedback and was told he will be terminated but obviously NTUC has ignored the feedback. Please do not be afraid and call police if you are intimidated by his mannerism. This guy should not be doing this and obviously need lots of training. He is constantly on his phone when unoccupied.",
