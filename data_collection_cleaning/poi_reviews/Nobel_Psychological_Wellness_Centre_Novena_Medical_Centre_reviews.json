However, upon arriving at the clinic, I was told that I will need to pay out of pocket unless I have a referral letter from a general practitioner. This was NOT communicated to me beforehand but they insisted they did. They did not want to acknowledge a mistake made on their part and there was no apology for the inconvenience caused. I walked out despite waiting weeks for my appointment.",

I have severe manic bi-polar and she helped me manage my symptoms and reintegrate myself into society as a more confident and positively social individual. Dealing with this illness is one of the hardest things I have ever had to manage. I am so glad I met someone who truly understands the person not the illness and is able to provide sound, practical, emotional and beneficial advice. Thank you Dr Zheng, I will never forget the times you were there for me. I highly recommend Dr Zheng for mood disorders and would advice anyone seeking help to give her a chance as she is unlike any psychiatrist I have met in Singapore.",
