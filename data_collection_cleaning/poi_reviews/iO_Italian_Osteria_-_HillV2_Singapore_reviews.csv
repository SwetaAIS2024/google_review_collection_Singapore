Sylvia Lim,5,"Love the food and service at iO Italian Osteria. Second visit today and it was as good as my first visit. Despite the restaurant being packed, staff were all friendly, polite and in good spirits. Dishes were served promptly, presentation and flavours on point. My guests and I were especially taken care of by Jit â€“ wonderful lady who took time to recommend me the specials. Her sincerity could be felt at every point of our dinner. Thank you, Jit!

Can't wait to head back to again soon. Delicious food, fair prices and feels like family :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100292712969511402646/reviews
Jason Wang,5,"As a frequent patron, the food and service at iO has always been excellent and well worth the price.

Reservations are recommended, otherwise you will probably end up waiting for a bit. The restaurant is often quite crowded, especially during dinner time, and the tables are relatively close to one another.

Would definitely recommend their braised beer beef, stuffed Roman Bruschetta and Porchetta. Their Tiramisu is also quite nice.

The staff are all really friendly, but none more so that auntie Jit, who is an absolute delight. We will definitely be back soon.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101439310068259385632/reviews
Jamie Loo,5,"walked in without reservation and managed to get counter seats for 2! quite pricy but worth it for authentic italian cuisine and the novelty and fun of sitting at the counter watching the chefs in action!!! so tasty and filling. service was great too, we had our free water refilled 3x without any prompting!

total was about $87 for 2 ppl (prices seem to have increased as they are higher than the prices on their website's menu)
- lasagna $19
- mushrooms ~$12-14
- raviolacci $24
- lava cake w espresso ice cream $16",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106108644034488313744/reviews
foop diaries,5,"This place is really good highly recommend. The service was top notch and the food is really high quality for the price.

We got the meatballs, medium pizza, tangliolini and pistachio tiramisu.

The meatballs were really fat and round and the cheese and tomatoes sauce really elevated this dish.

The pizza serving was extremely large and generous and the crust is really crunchy the mushrooms topped ones were the most delicious.

The pasta flavour was really unique and aromatic and creamy and tangy.

The tiramisu is not too sweet but still creamy and nutty. Really great way to end the meal.

It was a full house when I came in on a weekend so recommend to reserve in advance.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100110470336289731231/reviews
rathi preeta,4,"We went as a group of 10, prior reservations is recommended as we had to still wait for 10 mins as the tables had to be cleared.
The bruschetta was a burst of flavors, the roasted chicken was perfect.
The pastas were good though every single one of them was floating in olive oil.

The pizza was delicious as were the desserts. The panna cotta n tiramisu were perfect with just the right amount of sweetness.

The drinks were a bit of a let down, the coffee with bubble was good though, ask for sugar syrup as it is with no sugar.

Ambience and service was good, we had a fun time .",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103728566549833833279/reviews
