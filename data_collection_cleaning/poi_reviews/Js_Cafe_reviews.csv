YC Ang,5,"Was here for breakfast in Feb 2025 (review was somehow not posted) before catching my coach - coffee was perfect. I have been looking forward to revisiting on weekdays again to try other food by its Chef Owner Jack, who is such a humble guy. Finally had dinner this evening as cafe closes later than usual before the weekends (long weekend this week) - superb creamy carbonara pasta. Definitely recommended and a place to revisit.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100909345515676980436/reviews
Lee Sammie,5,"Excellent Coffee, tasty daily lunch menu and delectable pastries, especially their cheesecake. Boss is impressive - really impressed he makes all the lunch mains, desserts, pastries and sandwiches himself. Cozy place to stick around when it’s not the lunch hour. Prices are super reasonable although location may not be the best. Definitely recommend at least a visit!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109607212770300706964/reviews
