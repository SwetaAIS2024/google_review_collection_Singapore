Kelvin Lim,1,"1 meat and 1 vegetable cost me $4.90. The salted egg meat itself is $3. You can refer to the photo posted. Nothing spectacular about these dishes but from my own opinion, it is below average. I feel it is better off for me eating at the nearby hawker centre. The eating area is quite alright except for some flies flying around that irritated me while eating. Overall, I will not go back again as the prices are quite pricey. Above is just my humble opinion but it may differ depending on what food was selected.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112858140990914242530/reviews
Gator,3,"Tried the Chinese mixed vegetable rice today. Decided to order four dishes instead of the usual three. Had one fried egg, curry vegetables, bean curd skin and fried pork belly. Was pretty shocked when the bill came up to be $6.30 for this meal. However, lady was very friendly and as the coffee shop is new, itâ€™s a clean and nice environment to dine in. I did not find it tasty but itâ€™s strictly my own personal taste bud.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews

David X,1,Order  2 fish 1 egg 1 tofu 1 vege 1 rice and charge me 9.6.  Not sure if get overcharged but apparently not as cheap as their menu. I heard a previous customer argue the price. They also do not input properly in their cashier. Be cautious.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103079524539086403921/reviews
