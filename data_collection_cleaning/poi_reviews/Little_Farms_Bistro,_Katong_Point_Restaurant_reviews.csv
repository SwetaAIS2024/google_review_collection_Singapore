HealthcAIre Kim,3,"Little Farms, Katong Point: Once our usual haunt, we took a hiatus and I was surprised by the service that dipped below the knees. We walked by ad decided to do the 1 for 1 small plates but the greeter seemed surprised we wanted to dine there. Clueless about the promos, menu and fumbled through. Our server was much better. Shrimp is the best of the 3 we ordered - mock calamari was a waste of substance. Hummus was so sparse. Once our preferred, Little Farms Katong have fallen from grace. #eatstylishtravelstylish",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101154220359165719571/reviews
Su-Sanne Ching,4,Not my first time at Open Farms. Decided to take my elderly folks this afternoon for brunch. Surprisingly they liked it too. Food was well presented and the fresh produce made the food more of a delectable treat. Pauline’s service was spot on and a rare find these days; made our visit a lot more enjoyable.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107464480223080334144/reviews

Jessica Meadows,4,"Food was really good! I discovered it when I was trying to find a place to get my nails done and found this gem. Love the music selection and I can tell it's really fresh food. I went for lunch and dinner, two separate days and I think the Mocha I had was better the first time but the Acai bowl is what I really went for and it did not disappoint. Would definitely come again, hopefully when not so crowded.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104655200694126613029/reviews
Nadine Asha,5,"Visited this bistro on 15th March evening for dinner, and ordered their smashed burger, pan-seared salmon, cauliflower salad and pita bread with hummus. Especially loved their burger, moist patties and buttery bread, as well as their salmon! their cauliflower salad (especially the yoghurt dressing) was great as well! will definitely revisit! Special shout out to Pauline for her service, thank you!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110439860863701980127/reviews
