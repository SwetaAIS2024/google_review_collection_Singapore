LP Pua,3,"Several coffee stalls lined the food center, but this one seemed to be the most popular. The open layout and bright lighting were inviting. Service was friendly and efficient; my coffee arrived faster than I could complete my mobile payment. The coffee's taste was okay but didn't stand out.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
CK C,5,"One of my favourite drink stalls in Mei Ling Food Centre, as the owners are not only extremely friendly and polite, the teh and kopi were great too. The breakfast set was also enjoyable but the eggs were too watery. They are also one of the rare stalls that do not use disposal plastic cups (pardon the straw) for dine-in. They accept e-payment too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Sam Wong,5,"Their yuan yang($1.30) is smooth, medium thickness and have tea smell. Tea more than coffee so less bitter. Next time I should opt for slightly less sweet. Stall owner also very friendly and have many regular customer. Overall 8/10.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115694236480258826587/reviews
Paul Tan,5,"Edit: returned almost 2 years after my first visit in Dec 2020 and the coffee is still good!

Lived nearby for decades, but Iâ€™ve only just discovered this stall, with the most wonderful Iced Kopi C Siu Dai. They also sell boba, sugar cane juice, kumquat, and the usual toast and eggs. Iâ€™ll be back!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110894682482952608883/reviews
lynn,4,"I ordered teh siu siu dai, and was super impressed by how it rly tasted minimally sweet yet still sufficiently gao!! (When I place the same order at other places, I usually get a super diluted teh instead) will definitely be back for their teh ðŸ¥°

Bubbles were pretty soft and chewy too - not the best but good enough to satisfy a pearl craving!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113035353984436054163/reviews
