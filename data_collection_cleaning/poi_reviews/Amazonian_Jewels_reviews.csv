Aust Bowy,5,"An amazing place with equal birds to static electricity. If one touches the railings made of metal. One is sure to get a shocking discovery. Due to the material of the floor and railings,static electricity is abundant at this place.

That being said,the plethora of birds that one can discover at this place is staggering from frogmouths to beautiful lorries that can be fed($8).

Travel from section to section and discover different birds. Do spot the special animals scattered too that differ. Hint*Look at the floors.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114792133112470845510/reviews
