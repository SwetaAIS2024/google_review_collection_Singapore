      "text": "Very good bread fully filled with fresh cream and nuts, baked daily in the morning, with very good price, cheaper than breadtalk. Compare to most cafe selling bread easily at 6-7 dollars, I obviously preferred their bread better. Aircon indoor seats available if you preferred to dine in. Coffee is also up to cafe standard with decent price. Friendly & helpful shop owner. :) Hope more people to visit here. I haven't found a cafe with good bread and decent price for a long while. Feel so happy to have one around this neighbourhood.",

Bread was light and fluffy and although it sounded weird at first I was pleasantly surprised at how well it all worked together. Owner was also very welcoming and very enthusiastic in introducing to us what she recommended. Atmosphere was also very clean and calm, with good ambiance. Overall will definitely revisit and try many of their other goods!",
