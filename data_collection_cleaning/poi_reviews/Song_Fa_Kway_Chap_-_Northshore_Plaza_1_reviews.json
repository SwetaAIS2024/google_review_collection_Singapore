      "text": "The kway chap was smooth, and the soup base was flavorful and comforting. We ordered the 2-pax set, and the portions were generous, offering great value for the price. The food tasted excellent—especially the intestines, which were well-cleaned with no unpleasant smell. The pork belly and duck meat were tender and delicious, complementing the meal perfectly. Highly recommend this place for kway chap lovers!",

      "text": "Song Fa Kway Chap (Northshore Plaza 1): A Mostly Positive Experience with Self-Service Ordering (4/5 Stars)\n\nRating:\n\n• Ambiance: 4/5 (Inviting and pleasant, with a comfortable and clean dining space)\n\n• Food Quality: 4/5 (Delicious Chang to Kway and Peppery Kway with Minced Meat, but the duck meat in the Deluxe Set was a bit dry. Homemade Barley was a nice complement)\n\n• Service: 4/5 (Efficient and convenient self-service ordering with an easy-to-use kiosk)\n\n• Value: 4/5 (Reasonable prices, especially considering portion sizes, but the slightly dry duck meat impacted the overall value slightly)\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\nDonkey and I recently enjoyed a meal at Song Fa Kway Chap, located in Northshore Plaza 1. Our overall experience was positive, marked by a welcoming atmosphere and efficient self-service ordering, though a minor issue with the food prevented a perfect score.\n\nAmbiance: The restaurant had a very inviting and pleasant atmosphere. It was a comfortable and clean dining space.\n\nFood: We ordered the Kway Chap Deluxe Set for 2, Chang to Kway, Peppery Kway with Minced Meat, and Homemade Barley. While the Chang to Kway and Peppery Kway with Minced Meat were delicious and well-prepared (Donkey particularly enjoyed the peppery kway chap, which not all kway chap stalls serve), the duck meat in the Deluxe Set was a bit dry. The Homemade Barley was a nice complement to the meal.\n\nService: We used the self-service kiosk for ordering, which was a quick and efficient process. The kiosk was easy to navigate and use.\n\nValue: At S$25.90, the price was reasonable, especially considering the portion sizes. However, the slightly dry duck meat slightly impacted the overall value.\n\nOverall: Song Fa Kway Chap at Northshore Plaza 1 offers a generally positive dining experience. The inviting ambiance and convenient self-service ordering are definite plus points. While the slightly dry duck was a minor drawback, the other dishes were tasty, and the overall value was good. We would recommend this location and would likely return to try other items on their menu.",

      "text": "Kitty and I were craving some delicious kway chap and decided to try Song Fa at Northshore Plaza 1, which had been recommended by a friend.  The moment we walked in, we were greeted by a clean and comfortable environment that felt perfect for a casual family meal. The modern, well-lit space had a welcoming and inviting ambiance, making us feel right at home.\n\nWe were excited to see the menu, which featured a variety of kway chap dishes, braised duck, and sides like yam rice and vegetables.  We decided to order the Kway Chap Deluxe Set for 2, Chang to Kway, Peppery Kway with Minced Meat, and Homemade Barley.  The self-service ordering kiosk was a breeze to use, and the food arrived promptly.\n\nThe Chang to Kway and Peppery Kway with Minced Meat were absolutely delicious! I particularly loved the peppery kway chap, a flavorful delight that's not always available. Kitty enjoyed both dishes as well. However, the duck meat in the Deluxe Set was a little dry, which was a bit of a disappointment.  But the Homemade Barley was a wonderful complement to the meal, providing a refreshing contrast.\n\nWhile the slightly dry duck meat impacted the overall value slightly, the prices were still reasonable, especially considering the generous portion sizes.  The inviting ambiance, convenient self-service ordering, and tasty food make Song Fa Kway Chap at Northshore Plaza 1 a generally positive dining experience.  Despite the minor drawback of the dry duck, we would definitely recommend this location and would likely return to try other items on their menu.",

      "text": "Really good kway chup, ate a few times now.\nRated a 3 for service as mostly self-service. Only service I experienced was when I received my food and the staff said thanks.\n\nOrder via self-help kiosk. It is quite easy to use and navigate. Pay already, take receipt and sit down at your preferred table, wait for your number to be shown on digital display. Collect food at 'collect point' and help yourselves to the cutleries and chilli.\n\nHad a 2 pax kway chup set and changed one to peppery soup. Was expecting the peppery soup to be the songfa bak kut teh version but it was a toned-down version. It was not as peppery.\n\nLoved the amount of ingredients given and they were of huge cuts. Would be great if they allow choosing of ingredients on the self-help kiosk.\n\nHave not tried the claypot dishes yet. Just enjoy having the kway chup.",
