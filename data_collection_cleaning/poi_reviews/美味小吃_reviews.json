      "text": "Delicious bee hoon, it was cooked just before the stall is open at 6pm. The chilli sauce is savoury which is quite unique of it own. They also got sell porridge and dessert. The downside is not all the food will be ready on time. if you want a wider selection then be there about 6.10pm, but there was a long line in the weekend already. Price is very affordable considering in this inflationary period, depending what you order too. My meal cost $5.30 but it was so satisfying overall.\n\nTaste is subjective, what is tasted nice to me may not be yummy good for some of your.",
