Price increased this year (2024) but still cheap.\n\nDrinks are nicely done too specially their hot milo.\n\nCan try mee poh as noodles are very springy and nicely done. Laksa not too bad but not the best. Soup a little watery kind but taste is maintain. Generous in their ingredients too. Worth the price still.",
