Low Bao Heng,3,"The nasi lemak still not bad. Look like white rice but it taste & smell fragrant. Jus not sure how the pricing works..

1 chicken wing + egg = $2.60
Luncheon Meat + Fish Fillet + egg = $2.60

But when I ordered this:
1 Hashbrown + 1 Hotdog + 1 Egg = $3.80

ðŸ˜… the service also like average level.. The auntie not friendly!
