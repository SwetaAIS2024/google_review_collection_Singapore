So hearty and delicious ðŸ¥¹ We also ordered galub jamun for dessert and the staff generously gave it to us on the house. 10/10 would go back to try the other dishes again~ Loved the wall mural too.",

Just look at how we wiped out our dinner.\n\nIf itâ€™s your first time here and youâ€™re unsure of what to order, just order whatever we ordered in the attached receipt! Quality Indian cuisine at just $20 per person! You will not be disappointed.\n\nService as usual, is top notch. We were extremely well taken care of by all the staff working that night. Always a fast and pleasant experience here at Butter N Spice ðŸ¥° We were also treated to free dessert to end off our delightful dinner.\n\nIf you love Indian food, this is definitely a must go!",

The portion was generous and well-balanced.\n\nService was excellent as wellâ€”the staff was attentive, friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed. The warm hospitality really added to the experience. Definitely a place Iâ€™d return to for a great Indian meal!",

Suppose good for dining in groups, small parties. It's a little tricky to find if you come from Marina Parade's side, possibly easier when approaching from Katong road.",
