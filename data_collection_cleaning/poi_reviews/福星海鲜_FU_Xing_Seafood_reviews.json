Assam fish head which costs $25 is ok, with nothing exceptional or bad. What irks me is the fried egg with chives. At $8, I would have expected something more substantial than what you can see from the photo. My kids feel that it’s only worth $3 but I think $5 is probably reasonable. Definitely not $8. While it tastes ok, this has marred the experience and one try is more than enough for us.",
