Clement Cher,5,"Made a booking at the following branch for dinner. For weekdays there were still tables available. Staff are attentive and friendly and we were sitted and served rather quickly.

We ordered beef bowls, sushi and some fried finger food. The beef bowls as they were delicious.  Sushi is fresh and for the fried food uniqueness depended more on the sauces. Beef bowl portion is small for a small eater but adding up everything, portion is just nice.

Price maybe considered steep. But overall will revisit again for the beef bowls.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113278228004850197170/reviews

Susan Chua,5,"Went early to avoid lunch time crowd.

Ordered Original Wagu bowl, added foie gras( hopefully yuzu is not added) and sashimi salad.

The wagu beef slices are very delicious, and soft. Enjoyed the sashimi salad too - loaded with sashimi cubes, octopus, oranges, tomatoes and salad.

Staff is friendly too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109044323196867718721/reviews

luvpuzzle,5,"Awesome chicken karaage! super tasty with the mentaiko dip. beers were well-priced as well, at $8.8++ before 8pm. Supposedly smoke-free but there will still be patrons secretly smoking away or vaping away. Good that the staff will come and remind customers to put away their smoke.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103749950771785360928/reviews
