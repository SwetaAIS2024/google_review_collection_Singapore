zzubsg,1,"Taste like inflation, price doesn‚Äôt justify the taste and standard ,only justified the rent. Portion is way too small. Don‚Äôt waste your time eating here trust me ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113215489564247084345/reviews
Venny Juliana,5,"First time try their menu no.4, breaded fish with rice. This menu comes with beans and salad. Beans served not cold, which is good. Salad also taste fresh, veggies still crunchy. The breaded fried fish crunchy and meaty inside. What surprising is their brown sauce goes well with the rice n meal. Must try when you around here. My fussy picky eater daughter even said, i like the food.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114070569380434404874/reviews
