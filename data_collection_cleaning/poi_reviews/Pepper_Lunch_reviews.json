We had to insist to the counter that there was student meal because they didn’t believe us at first. But need to show id. Food is served out fast in 5 mins so that’s a plus. Hygiene wise.. I don’t know. We saw a baby cockroach crawling on another table….",

      "text": "Jasphine & team.(Jurong Point)\nI just wanted to take a moment to express how truly touched I was by your kindness and thoughtfulness during my visit. It was heartwarming to see you reserve a table specifically for your staff to break their fast. This small but incredibly meaningful gesture speaks volumes about your character and the care you have for those around you.\n\nIt’s rare to come across such genuine consideration, and witnessing it firsthand made my experience at your Pepper lunch jurong point even more special. Thank you for not only serving food with such dedication but for also fostering an environment filled with compassion and respect.\n\nWishing you and your team continued blessings and success!",

Months later, we can now order, pay on the QR menu and wait without moving from our seat.\n\nI very much prefer this outlet to JEM due to the spacious and open dining area for air flow.\n\nRecommendation? You can't go wrong with their beef pepper rice. What you order aside from this depends on how adventurous you are.",
