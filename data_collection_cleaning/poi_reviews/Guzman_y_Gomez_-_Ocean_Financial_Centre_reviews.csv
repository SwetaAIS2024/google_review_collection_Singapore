Savio D'Souza,4,"I recently had a quick supper at this restaurant. I really liked the service and the ambience. I ordered a taco and Burrito.

I haven't cultivated a taste for mexican food and didn't think either was great.

But my POV for those who like mexican food, this might be a good dining experience.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116410144810410942051/reviews
Qiao Qing Yong,5,"The staff at this outlet are very helpful. Jorie was friendly and knowledgable about ingredients and allergies. Many items on the menu were surprisingly allergy-friendly. They have a very detailed allergen menu and I managed to order easily while refering to the allergen list.

I ordered a bowl of unseasoned fries, ground beef and guacamole, all of which are free from Top 9 allergens.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115336693013154599000/reviews

Rachel,1,"Ate here yesterday, staff #1 got my order wrong, other staff members (staff #2 and #3) gave poor service (no apology at all, didn't bother to try to fix the wrong order, lots of blank staring and ignoring me, and I had to instruct them to make the correct order) and the aluminium foil was so sharp that it cut my lip and caused my mouth to bleed all over my food and drink ðŸ˜” Even the next evening (today), my mouth was stinging as I ate. Do not recommend at all.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101154604544304083235/reviews
