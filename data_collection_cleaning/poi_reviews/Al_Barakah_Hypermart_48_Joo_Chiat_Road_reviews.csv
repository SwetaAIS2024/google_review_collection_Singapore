Jnadra,5,"Al Barakah Hypermarket @ Joo Chiat Road

Al Barakah at Joo Chiat Road is a fantastic shop with a wide range of quality products, from supplements and frozen food to beautifully packaged dates. It‚Äôs a one-stop destination for anyone looking for meaningful and practical items.

The store is clean, well-organized, and stocked with a variety of products. I was particularly impressed by the selection of supplements available, which were reasonably priced and of great quality. The frozen food section was also a highlight, offering convenient and delicious options. The dates sold here were beautifully packaged and perfect for gifting or enjoying at home.

The staff or maybe one of the owner the cheerful gentleman were extremely kind and attentive, always ready to help with recommendations and ensure a smooth shopping experience. Their warm and sincere service made my visit even more enjoyable.

If you‚Äôre in Joo Chiat, Al Barakah is a must-visit. Whether you‚Äôre shopping for daily essentials, gifts, or unique food items, this shop has everything you need. Highly recommended!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102358351891654545112/reviews
