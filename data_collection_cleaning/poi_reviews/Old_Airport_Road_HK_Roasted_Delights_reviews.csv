Rick Koh,5,"Very good roasted pork, crispy skin and tender meat. Roast duck is pretty good too, only let down is they served me the small drumlet from the wing area. Too chewy for my liking. And also they ran out of Char Siu, not sure they even prepare the Char Siu in the first place.

However, their complimentary bowl of soup was the most tasty free soup I had. Cooked with cabbage which gives the soup a nice sweetness to it.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106510842319180067826/reviews
Victor Chee,4,"This roast delight was recommended by friends.

Came here with a group of coworkers and ordered mixed of Roast Duck,  Char Siew,  and roast pork.

The roast duck is nice, and the meat was quite tender.

The roast pork and Char Siew were very good and not too many fats as compared to 88 roast.

Recommended for those that don't like too much fats in the meat.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106733091772357491966/reviews
Katherine Lim,1,"Visited the stall and was extremely disappointed.
After queuing for about 15 to 20mins, all Iâ€™ve got is bones with skins and very little meat.
Iâ€™ve even request for roast duck and paid for it.
The only saving grace is the char siew.

There are better roast duck stall out there.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106988841967555118545/reviews
Jade,1,"Food tasted normal.
Roasted Pork Belly is crispy.
Duck meat is nothing to shout about.

Order Roasted Pork Belly with Duck meat rice. I thought is $5.50. But in the end charged me $6 and the one serving me said ""all price increased"". ðŸ™„

Wonder where is the hype here

First and the last for me.

To add on, wanted to order Char Siew with Duck meat initially. They told me that day they never sell char siew. Siew Lup stall never sell char siew? Come on..",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115421770636705285087/reviews
