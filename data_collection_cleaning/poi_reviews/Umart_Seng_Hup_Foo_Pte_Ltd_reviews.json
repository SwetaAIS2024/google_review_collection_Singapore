      "text": "This is one of the collection point for Shopee. There were two customers there before I come to collect my stuff but the customers were not queueing to pay so I told the staff I wanted to collect my items. The staff told me to wait, she needs to serve her customers. So I queue after the first customer, the staff then skip me and serve the second customer and another two group of customers who came after me. I mean if you do not have capacity to be a collection point, then donâ€™t. If customers keep coming in, does that mean I need to wait till the she prioritise the customers who brings her money??",
