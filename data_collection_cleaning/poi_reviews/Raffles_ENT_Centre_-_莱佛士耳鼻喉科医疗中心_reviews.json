      "text": "Dr Chan Siew Chee. This doctor seems senior, but I don‚Äôt know what he have learned in his experience. Rude to the core and worst behaviour. When we‚Äôre asked questions about our condition, the responses were curt and dismissive, making us feel like a burden rather than a patient seeking help. A good doctor should be patient and empathetic, but unfortunately, that was not our experience here. My request for Raffles Medical to send him a course to teach how to be patience and care towards the patients. Doctor are angels but he is not.",

He is impatient and uncaring, did the nose scope without waiting for the numbness to kick in and caused significant distress and pain, despite feedback from the patient. Only concerned with getting patients in and out as fast as possible. No attempts to truly understand the situation or explain the findings. Do not waste your time and money here. STAY AWAY!",

He was straightforward and quick to take action.. Overall, Dr. Stephen is a good doctor who is also gentle.\n\nBoth of my ears were in pain, swollen and blocked, and I could barely hear things, but Dr.Stephen sorted it all out in 3 days. The only thing I found lacking was that he didn't explain much about my diagnosis. I had to take the initiative to ask.\n\nThe cost was quite on the steep side, but what matters is that I'm recovered! Thanks Dr. Stephen! :)",

Horrible experience with this \"doctor\", and will never want to come back. Kept cutting in when I was talking and did not believe I had a ear condition that causes me to hear lesser than I expected.\n\nOther ENT doctors explained thoroughly and talked with sense but this guy just sounds like an entitled prick. I don't know what lousy and cheap qualifications this \"doctor\" has but I believe its long overdue and no longer qualified. I do hope this fake doctor makes a horrible mistake to find himself rotting in the streets.",
