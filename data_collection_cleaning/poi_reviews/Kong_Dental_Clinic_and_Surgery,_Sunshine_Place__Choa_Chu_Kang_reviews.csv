Tong Woon Yeo,5,"My dental visit was a fantastic experience! Dr. Melissa Lim was skilled and gentle during my scaling and polishing, putting me at ease. Her assistant was very attentive, ensuring my comfort throughout. The male counter staff was friendly and efficient, handling everything smoothly. The clinic was clean and well-organised. Highly recommend Dr. Lim and her team for their professionalism and excellent service!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101363397942812404747/reviews
HAPPY Mr & Mrs,5,"Visited on 09/01/25 for my wisdom/molar tooth extraction. Dr Melissa was very reassuring, informative and patient with my jitters. The procedure was quick and composed, thanks to her efficient teamwork with the kind dental assistant too. I am grateful that the wound healed well (along with my trauma from another clinic, lol). Such a wonderful experience.

Decided to return on 21/01/25 for dental cleaning. Dr Gabriel was respectful, soft-spoken and super gentle. The dental assistant was also friendly and thoughtful when I got nervous. I definitely gained more confidence for future dental check-ups. Another lovely experience, for sure.

Overall, the call centre team did a great job arranging my appointments seamlessly (via whatsapp) to the best talents of the clinic. I also appreciate the follow-up on my condition after the extraction visit. I am very happy and I definitely will return for future appointments.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118156567140233843841/reviews
ady yusri,5,"Recommended by a friend. Fantastic. Dr. Cynthia advised me not to extract my teeth and just do filling. The explanation given was good. Place though small was very comfy. That bro, the reception?. CS skills top notch. 10/10 would visit again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106400239652287617137/reviews
