The cozy space is intimate yet inviting, and there‚Äôs even a secret menu for bites if you know how to ask.\n\nThe cocktails we tried were fantastic, each with a unique touch of Japanese influence that felt both innovative and thoughtfully crafted.\n\nSpecial thanks to Mark for the exceptional service. We‚Äôll be back the next time we‚Äôre in Singapore!",

They took time to explain the menu and dishes to us üëèüèª Really love that little touch!\n\nThankful it wasn‚Äôt a very busy Friday as well, so had a quiet dinner, which was nice!\n\nLoved the starters and the maki! Def worth trying the house maki - the mentaiko sauce was AMAZING! And the uni pasta, was a really rich creamy sauce which went so well with the uni!\n\nReally great first time at this place, and enjoyed ourselves!",
