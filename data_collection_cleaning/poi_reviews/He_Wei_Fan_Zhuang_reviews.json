My husband and I are frequent patrons of this economic rice store since it opened around 2 months ago.\n\nfirst 2 visits, the portions have been great. Subsequently, the portions gets lesser and lesser and food quality also reduced.\n\nToday during my visit, I ordered sweet and sour pork and the staff only gave me 3 small pieces of meat, very little vege and very little potato. Not sure what‚Äôs with the poor serving and when I asked about it, they told me ‚Äúthe boss asked us to do this‚Äù without even thinking to do some service recovery?\n\nAnd when I mentioned if this is the portion I‚Äôm getting compared to before, and I‚Äôm paying the same price, then why should I patronise them, the girl staff raised her voice at me and said ‚ÄúTHEN YOU DONT EAT‚Äù\n\nSure. It‚Äôs never about the amount I have to pay, but about upkeeping the standards and having basic service attitude.\n\nWhen we were leaving, another staff was doing the serving (man in photo) please patronise them only when this guy is the server. Becus he gives big portions..\n\nSo is it the boss say one, or is the staff has some issue üòÖ",
