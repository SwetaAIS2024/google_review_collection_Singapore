74tankee,5,"The coconut latte was as good as the one I had in Beijing. Rich, thick and yummy. Definitely better than the similar drink I had in other luckin coffee outlet in Singapore. Good atmosphere at evening when the working crowd left for home.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107884042123595070412/reviews

TechPotato SG,5,"Posting a review on here cause the other reviews don't do justice to this shop.

First and foremost, there is no POS system, they go by a QR scan for you to place an order fully online.(Kudos to this as the shop will attract long queues)

Secondly, if you're ordering from grab, i believe your review should be with grab and not the outlet itself

I purchased my coffee here out of curiosity, jumped in on a 0.99 cents offer for new customers and my goodness, it tastes even better than most A* grade coffees out there.The blend of fresh grounded beans and oat milk is just superb.I had it for takeaway, packaging was excellent, with the paper bag and the drink holder in place.To my surprise, they even put a tab of tape on the lid to prevent liquids from spilling during transport.

Kudos to the staff working here too.I took pity in the staff when she's prepping more than one order only to get bombarded with qns like ""Um may i know the outlets name?"" Its literally on the signage where you scan to order.She still responded with a very gentle and kind voice yes, this is fairprice hub outlet.Collected my coffee when the app prompts me, staff was professional as to double check the number before scanning the confirmation QR code.

Syuhaidah Ashaari,4,"i wanted to get my fix of coffee from luckin so i brought my husband to Joo Koon to grab one. my husband was a coffee freak like me but due to health reasons he had to stop taking in caffeine. upon arriving luckin, he was scrolling through the app and we both asked a staff there named Wayne if the vanilla flavoured latte has any coffee in it, which we were told no. so we went ahead and ordered a cup of Gesha Dirty for myself and Vanilla Flavoured Latte for my husband. However, upon receiving the the drink, Wayne told me that he had thought we were asking about the Frappe which has no coffee in it whereas theres coffee in the Latte. My husband was reluctant to take the coffee, so Wayne offered to change the drink. When we picked a drink to change, Wayne went ahead to ask another staff named Lulu, probably the supervisor. Speaking in Chinese (im a malay who understands a small portion of chinese), Lulu said that they did not make a mistake, so the drink cannot be changed. Which fair enough, we ordered the drink, they made it, no mistakes was done. However, we had asked before ordering, so i dont see why the drink cant be changed, in fact Wayne recognized his mistake and offered to change the drink. my husband decided to order another cup of Chocolate Frappe and throw the coffee away.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111389271237910570641/reviews
