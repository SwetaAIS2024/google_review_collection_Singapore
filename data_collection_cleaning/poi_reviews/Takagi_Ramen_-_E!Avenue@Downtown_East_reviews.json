      "text": "+ Prices start from $7.90, which is as cheap as it can be.\n\n- But food quality reflects the price as well. The charsiu, while more in pieces than elsewhere, is slightly tougher and thinner.\n\n- Something annoying: there was a lightbox wall poster that said there was a $5 nett student/NSF deal. But when we tried to order it, the lady kept insisting that this deal is not available without explaining properly why so. Something about the system being not updated in time (how can this be?). Another lady chef was prepared to accept this price deal by taking cash, but the first lady kept saying no. In the end, we had to order the other ramen dish deals.",

      "text": "Had an amazing experience at Takagi Ramen DTE branch. I have always been a lover for Takagi Ramen (through takeaway) but never once I ate in the restaurant. The service team at Downtown East was superb (especially Wil and his team working on a busy public holiday on the 31st March) where they are lacking of staff but still go an extra mile to ensure that rhe quality is met and all customers’ orders are fulfilled. Kudos to Takagi ramen for a strong staffing team and culture!\n\nNot to forget, the restaurant is very clean despite the high amount of traffic/crowd! 🙏🏼😌",

      "text": "My first time to Takagi Ramen cos wanted to use the 1-for-1 deal from Shopee.\n\nOrdered the Butashoga Ramen, which was surprisingly tasty considering the price.\n\nAdded the fried gyozas which were cooked perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Also ordered the Rose Calamansi Soda which has a stronger taste of rose together with the sourness of the calamansi.\n\nThe staff was patient and helpful in the ordering process!",
