      "text": "With a name like that, one would not have guessed that this is a noodle stall. But it is. One of the newest in Clementi West Coast area, this new stall is located at the newest Kopitiam, Foodland 713.\n\nAnd it sells all sorts of noodles. Bak Chor Mee, Fishball Noodles, Ban Mian, Laksa, Kolo Mee and even fish soup!\n\nOrdered their Fishball Noodles, Mee Kia dry with chilli for $4.30. The noodles were cooked right, but not the round thin noodles variety but the thin but flat type. The specialty chilli was good. Savoury with dried prawns, it made up for the otherwise unimpressive fishballs and the equally bland soup.\n\nNew stall still getting the hang of things as the boss lady is seen continuously coaching the two employees from how to cook the noodles to how to fry an egg.\n\nWill come back to review their other items some other day.",
