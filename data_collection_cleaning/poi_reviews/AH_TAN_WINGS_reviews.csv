Touristmouse,4,"This has been on my ""must-try"" list since pre-covid, so I was thrilled to finally get to try it when I was in the area. Since I'd already eaten, I opted for the minimum order of two wings for $4.40. Despite it being past the usual lunch rush, there was still a steady stream of customers, proving that chicken wings are truly a dish for any time of day! My order was ready in under 3 minutes, and I appreciated the thoughtful presentation, which even included a few slices of cucumber.
Taking my first bite, I was immediately impressed by the airy crunch of the batter, which surprisingly didn't feel greasy at all. Given that the wings were pre fried and refried upon order, the meat leaned slightly towards the drier side. However, I did appreciate the light marination of the wings, without being overly salty.  The accompanying chilli sauce, a classic chicken rice style garlicky chilli, complemented the wings perfectly.  Overall, while these might not be the absolute best har cheong gai I've ever had, they are certainly above average and definitely worth checking out if you happen to be in the area.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110409011587721664076/reviews

Wee Guan Kho,4,"Modern chicken rice served with Prawn Paste Chicken Wings !

The taste of prawn paste is distinct, chicken wing is not as crispy though, probably because itâ€™s a takeaway.
Chili is spicy with a punch !",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100019001441662947499/reviews
