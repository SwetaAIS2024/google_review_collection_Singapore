Palvindran Jayram,1,"Second visit to the clinic. Panel (regular) doctor was not around so I had the misfortune of being served by a covering doctor. It was shitty service for 5 mins, had no people skills or showed any care. He also could not properly diagnose or prescribed an effective medication. Harshly overpriced! I would recommend the panel doctor a review of whoever that covered his duties on 5 May.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101553755460533276448/reviews
Jeong Kyun,1,"Utterly stupid queue system, administrative staff gave instructions to sick and potentially infectious patients to ""wait outside"" in an undefined location.

Mind you, this was after patient registration had been completed, so contact details were already registered. How hard would it be to implement some form of callback system? Occupancy load was quite light, too (note attached photo of practically empty clinic).

Would not visit again, and would strongly recommend against visiting.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100970648699813537496/reviews
Wenqi Lee,5,"I can understand why the wait to see Dr Sun would be long because he doesn't interrupt or cut you off. So naturally each patient will take about 10mins. So with just 6 patients in front of us, we had to wait 1hr. But I think having a patient doctor is worth the wait, unless you're the type who just wants an MC and go home. There's a shengsiong supermarket and coffee shop nearby to while time away if needed.

Reception staff were very polite, friendly and helpful. Gave me a free plaster for my open wound when I'm not the patient, just an accompanying caregiver.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106658581438567006184/reviews
E S,3,"Nice doc & friendly receptionist but medicine prescribed just by patient's description without taking temp, checking the inflammation site nor listening to breathing in the lungs is like telemedicine. And even though I asked but he would not. However this clinic charged the highest in the west vicinity for consultation. Does not carry enough medicines such as the basic ibuprofen.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114276708571397606919/reviews
