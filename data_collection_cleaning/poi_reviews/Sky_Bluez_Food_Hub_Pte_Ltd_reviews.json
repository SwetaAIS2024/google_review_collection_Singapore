      "text": "Small, unassuming Indian coffee shop next to the Hardware City. We tried it cos the 216 coffee shop next door was closed.\nWe ordered the roti prata, and since the guy taking our order wasn't very conversant, we went with what was on hand - plain prata and egg prata.\nThe pratas were chewy and hard, having been there for a while. Fortunately, this was made up for by the curry. Both the mutton and fish curry were thick and bursting with flavour. If you can get them to cook you fresh prata, this will be an excellent breakfast place.",

There is 1 foul mouthed man who is the loudest in the shop. Seems like food price is also catching up at this stall.",
