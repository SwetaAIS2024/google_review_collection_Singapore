      "text": "A very good display of older  jets, military aircraft, drones, anti aircraft missle systems. Lots of insignia and uniform displays. Models of military aircraft was excellent. Gift shop was very cramped, felt like a bull in a china shop. Caught the No.90 Bus out which stopped directly the front of the museum, No direct footpath into the museum carpark, had to walk on the road. Loved the \"Roar\" of the RSAF jets taking off from the runway next door. Would of been awesome if there was a viewing platform to actually see these jets.",

While the aircraft collection isn't extensive, each plane is accompanied by informative labels and detailed historical accounts. The museum building is modern and the exhibits are engaging.\n\nThere's a detailed history and emphasis on the A4s operated by the RSAF, along with some older models (Hawker Hunter, F5s and T33s)\n\nOverall, it's a pleasant and well-organized experience.\n\nThere is also a small gift shop or souvenir shop where you can find patches and tokens.",
