Drink choices are straight forward.\n\nWould give this place a 5 star, but since they do not offer food/light bites (had to purchase on my own at the 7/11 next door) - I had to stick with 4 star. Hopefully in the future they will offer food here.\n\nHowever I had a very pleasant experience here - and would definitely come back.",
