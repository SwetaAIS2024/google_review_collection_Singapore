Cécilia GOUBY,5,"I absolutely love this school. The facilities are a dream (garden to learn about the nature, pool for water play, parc nearby, ...); the staff is lovely and caring; the curriculum is engaging, diverse and fun. They organise a lot of activities for the kids and involve the parents. I can only recommend it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113200422338295674718/reviews
Maryam Azh,5,"Your child will have a fantastic time at Pat's Mount Emily. Our experience with both kids has been incredible. The management and teachers are always welcoming the kids with a heartedly smile and make their best efforts not only to educate and care for the kids but also offer kindness above and beyond their scope of work. The school has many unique facilities that add up to the excitement at school; the veggie garden, sandpit, pool, in-house kitchen, live animal tank etc. You can expect a perfect mix of outdoor and indoor activities for your child that is filled with joy and learning opportunities.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109582748348405411765/reviews
