Guading G,1,"Ordered thru pizzahut app for 7pm delivery. It’s already 830pm and still the food is not delivered yet. Tried to call the hotline and after 40+ tries, i was able to get through. The agent told me that the store would call me to update me on the status of my order. I have been waiting for 30mins and still no call from the store. I cannot even cancel my order. So disappointing.

NB:
The food came past 9pm. The driver was apologetic and said that the store was swamped with orders thats why there were a lot of late deliveries. If that’s the case, the store shouldnt have accepted anymore orders. Moreover, in the receipt, it was indicated that the store was to call me for an update. But i didnt receive any call.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116977154827635172858/reviews
Nur Iman Rostam,5,"Hurry! This is your last chance to try out the new Pizza Hut's Rendang-Licious Pizza which is at 59% off at only SGD 13.90 until the promo ends on March 5. The Pizza is fantastic with large chunks of chicken, gooey cheese and flavours of rendang bursting with every bite.

To honour Pizza Hut's newest outlet at Plantation Plaza in Tengah has now officially opened to the public. It faces the green square with a huge playground surrounded by a plethora of shaded walkways and linkways connecting to the already-resided HDB BTOs nearby.

The store is quite small with a few in-house seating configurations. However, it is linked to KFC Tengah next door. To get here, once arrive at the main Plantation Plaza lobby, head over to McDonald's and continue past it until you see a connecting walkway to the outlet.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110287485091231667131/reviews
Planet Mars 2033,4,"I placed my first order at a new branch, but the tracking information suddenly disappeared. With no contact number for the new branch, I called the old number, 62353535, which I hadn’t used in 30 years. Amazingly, someone answered and forwarded my concern to the new branch. Shortly after, the system updated, showing that the delivery was on its way. However, once I started eating, I realized an item was missing. I gave feedback, and they responded by sending a new delivery along with a few complimentary items. It was a nice first-time experience, especially after Domino’s had failed to deliver several times in the past.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114212871438191164256/reviews
