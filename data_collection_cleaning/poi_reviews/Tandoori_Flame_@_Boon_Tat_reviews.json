      "text": "I recently tried some Indian cuisine and was blown away by the flavors! The butter chicken was incredibly rich and creamy, with a perfect balance of spices that gave it depth without overwhelming the senses. The sauce was smooth, coating each tender piece of chicken in just the right way. Paired with the fragrant samali rice, which was cooked to perfection, it made for an unforgettable meal. The rice complemented the butter chicken beautifully, soaking up all the delicious sauce. Overall, each bite was packed with flavor and left me wanting more. Highly recommended for anyone looking to indulge in some authentic Indian flavors!",

However, the waiters were ready to serve and the chef was good to deliver.\n\nThe food was delightful. The tastes did not disappoint for sure. The plating was nice and portions generous.\n\nService was attentive and easy to get. They knew how to ensure customers got what they needed.\n\nThe decor of the place indoors met its objectives. They were alright for what they served. It didn‚Äôt exactly scream exuberant indulgence.\n\nOverall a nice quiet place for good Indian food.",

Samosa with Masala Tea is a good choice. The decoration is lovely and staff are attentive. Food came a bit small size compare to other restaurant but still love it and will be back.",
