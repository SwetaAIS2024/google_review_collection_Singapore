David Oon,5,"After 3.5hrs on the road with my 2-pedal-wheelers, this sweet version did it for me. The char siew is the kind I like, on a sweeter side, and has a good mix of fatty and lean layers. Noodles is qiu enough for me, and both the pickled green chilli and paste version has just the right punch. The green is crunchy and packs a nice enough kick, and the red one is savoury, flavourful without being too spicy! If your wanton fix is towards the savoury type, then give this a miss. But drop by for the char siew. Uncle Joe roasts them on the spot, with a charcoal brazier, no less. üòÅ",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111461636018977333111/reviews

Andrew MacDonald,5,Excellent wanton mee. Char siew is nicely charred and has a good amount of fat. Wantons are flavoursome. Noodles well cooked. And they're extremely generous with the lard!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103053926227757301193/reviews
Mark Yeo,5,"Tried the char siew that is not traditional red but actually blacken through caramelised sauces and gravy. Very much looking like ""lor bak"" braised pork in dark soya sauce. The texture, feel and taste is 5 stars. It can compete with well known Cantonese restaurants special char siew.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102332048638713474085/reviews
WenKang ‚Äúwenkang‚Äù Chin,4,"First time trying this wanton noodle.
Overall pretty good.
The charsiew tastes less juicier and flavourful than it looks. Noodle texture is firm and good. Generous vegetables which I like the most :-)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115756761244278882368/reviews
