V Lee,5,"We were a party of 5 and had a lovely time dining at Little Farms. We especially enjoyed the outdoor seating — it was a great setting to relax and enjoy our meal. The food was delicious! The salmon was beautifully done and a definite favourite at our table. The avocado quinoa was another standout — all the ingredients were super fresh and full of flavour.

The pork rack came in a generous portion, so it’s great for sharing. However, we personally prefer a bolder seasoning, so we might skip this next time. The beef, on the other hand, was excellent — tender and flavourful, and the fries were perfectly crispy without being dry.

Special mention to the service staff — they were very friendly and cheerful throughout. Even though it was clear they were a bit short-handed, they still maintained a positive attitude and made us feel well taken care of.

All in all, a great dining experience with fresh ingredients, lovely ambience, and warm service. We’ll definitely be back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100910507827951582147/reviews
Yenni Ng,5,"Went for a late lunch on 16 March 2025 after my daughter’s ballet exam. Service was superb from seating to serving to payment. Food was fantastic, fresh & well-prepared. Even though price slightly higher than other local cafes but with such service & food qua won’t mind to come back again. Definitely in my list of great cafes to recommend! 👍🏼👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108966889780822209943/reviews
Gan Liyin,4,"Tried Valentine's dinner set here.
The food taste great! The lightning and atmosphere also nice for being sweet sweet with the loved one.

The only thing wanted to comment is the speed of food serving.... We waited for around one hour for the appetizer, another half an hour for our main. And finally another 20 to 25mins for our desserts... The serving speed way too slow 😔.

Anyway, might give it one more try during non peak season.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106557997910022338827/reviews
May Lim,5,Delicious Aussie Breakfast with perfect portions — everything was fresh and flavorful. The coffee was rich and smooth and my favourite chicken breast barley rissoto was well prepared.

Mathilda T,4,"Located in the corner of MyVillage, the place offers outdoor seating with fans. Might not be the best to hang out on hot or rainy days.
Ordered the smashed burger, tomato soup, cauliflower chicken rice and a chocolate lava cake.

Tomato soup had a strong herb infusion.. I think it's basil. But the tangy flavor made it rather appetizing . It was served with a few slices of bread. (Server also gave the option of sour dough as well)

Cauliflower chicken rice was great. It's a twist on our local steamed chicken rice. Very big portion in my opinion. The chicken was tender and moist. One of the best I've had. The ginger sauce on the side was an awesome compliment to the chicken. Cauliflower rice was tasty and not too mushy.

Smashed burger came with salad on the side and a heap of fries! (Wasn't able to finish them!) the beef patty was slightly on the thick side but overall was not bad. But would probably try the other items on the menu if we do visit again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112675767176603876636/reviews
