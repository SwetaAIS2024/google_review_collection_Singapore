      "text": "Pasta was pretty decent but the portion quite tiny, maybe could introduce a XXL portion size like your pizzas.\nThe XXL pizza very generous portion and pretty worth the money imo\nTaste-wise, the pasta is pretty good\nThe pizza could be more flavourful? It felt kind of underwhelming not gonna lie.\nChicken wings were nice and scalding hot (my fingers were charred /s)",

      "text": "First time visiting this pizzeria. Wanted to try somewhere new for a change. I‚Äôm a thin crust pizza üçï lover. However, I didn‚Äôt really like the thin crust of the Diavola Pizza that I had for dinner.\n\nI found it to be slightly hard which was disappointing. The toppings were pretty good & yummy. Maybe just a tad too salty for me (I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to salt, spices, msg etc in foods). Perhaps that‚Äôs how it should be. I‚Äôm not sure.\n\nTo be fair, I gotta try more of their foods to give a holistic review.\n\nI ordered warm water ($0.50). What‚Äôs really nice was that the staff kept on topping it up for me.\n\nThe service from the staff was attentive and I like the overall vibes of the place. The place was almost fully packed at 7.50pm when I entered.\n\nWas lucky to find a nice table for dinner (I am also quite finicky about my table seating when I dine out ‚ò∫Ô∏è)\n\nI was the last to leave at close to 9pm, and I‚Äôm glad I was able to shoot the interior when it‚Äôs empty (I do feel a bit strange pointing my phone at folks when they are eating üòÇ)\n\nThe Sunday nite vibes were really jovial and everybody‚Äôs having a good time.\n\nI like the simple & tasteful decor of the eatery. The restrooms were really clean üíØüíØ\n\nI may come back again for another visit. Maybe for lunch? We shall see ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
