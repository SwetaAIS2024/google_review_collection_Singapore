Asvoria Kuan,1,"Unfortunately, the church community had developed into explicitly discriminative place which has no difference than other conservative churches. Although practicing open communion table, they openly practice ""call all non-believers as devils"" also some are zionists. In general, you get all the conservativeness of a traditional church disguise as a modern ""free community"" church. This is not a safe place to bring your beloved family and friends and definitely no grounds for any form of peaceful interfaith dialogues. Not recommended.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113653481851266416549/reviews
A-LL 388Z,5,"To Jesus be the glory! :D I'm 0 on the Kinsey Scale (to those in the know) and 100% straight (not my righteousness or asexuality qualifies me for heaven) but I've felt at home and manifest luuurrrve ever since I stepped into THIS body of the church so many years ago when it was nearer Aljunied. God loves us unreservedly and it has been easy to grow to love FCC unreservedly too! :D I fit into Unyque and Plush. Never gained entree to the other English/Mandarin CGs but I suppose us Cinderellas and Goldilockses could try them for fit! ^_^  Our folks are precious in God's eyes and I've found a loving, not just accepting spiritually, Christian home here. God has used this church and her people to help me grow in HIS character. LL",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106200893771999362999/reviews
J L,5,"A church that challenges worshippers to revisit their values and become better people, not just better Christians, so that they can improve others' lives. Not a money-obsessed church like a lot of churches these days. Progressive and one for our times.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110484005549083706651/reviews
