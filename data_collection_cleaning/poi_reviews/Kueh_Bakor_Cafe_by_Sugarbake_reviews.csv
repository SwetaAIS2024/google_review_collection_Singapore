Selvinia Nofy,5,"I visited this place for lunch on Friday. The ambiance is pleasant, and it wasn't overly crowded despite it being lunchtime. Parking was relatively easy, and the staff members were friendly.

The food was decent, but I found that it wasnâ€™t served hot enough. It was just warm, and I believe it would taste better if it were hotter. I recommend trying their kueh bakor; I had the pandan flavor and enjoyed it. I'm definitely planning to return and try the other flavors!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102676437011264302982/reviews
Nur Syazana Md Shariff,5,Clean n spacious restaurant. Fast service. Tried different flavour of kueh bakor and my top fav is Kueh Bakor Pandan. Gonna order the Mee Wantan Soup for my next visit as I dont really favour the dry one..,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100698454702016204566/reviews
Aisyah Ahmad,4,"Food & beverages were okay. My wanton thai soup was a bit of a miss though it did come with lots of chicken. My friends had the lontong kuah & kering and said they were good. Limited options on the menu. The kuih bakar is not my favourite unfortunately since I prefer my kuih bakar more burnt and crisp. This one is soft. Not bad but not my fav.

Price range imo is on the expensive side. Surprised to see the extra kuah kacang we requested which came in a small amount got charged RM3.

Service, parking and ambiance all ok.

Overall a very mid experience. Nothing too bad. Since I'm nearby then I do foresee myself coming here again occasionally to try other dishes.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103101187083979154969/reviews
Harman Harison,4,"The food presentation was good. The nasi lemak berkelah was tasty but it could have been better if the chicken and gravy was not cold. Lontong kering was okay but quite normal. Lempeng sambal sardin was the best as it was delicious and texture was soft with a good balance of sambal and sardine dish.

Both the ice coffee and hot coffee was nicely done and had a good balance of sweetness and coffee flavour.

I had kuih bakar dangai on the go and it was not as sweet as I expected it. Not what I used to eat when I was young but still okay.

The atmosphere was nice with pretty interior and good branding effort. There were a few flies roaming around while I was eating so a bit uncomfortable, might be helpful to clear out tables faster as flies tend to come if leftovers are on tables for too long.

Good place to have breakfast and recommended.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100447961201731726488/reviews
zyda azyan,5,"My son and  I stopped here for lunch nd for some snacks.
We ordered the Mee wantan soup @RM13.00 each, some coffee without sugar and a piece of the kuih Bakor ubi @RM 8 per piece. I wanted the Kueh Dangai, too but it was already too much to eat.
The wnatan soup is tasty with clear soup that I like. Surprisingly, the coffee without sugar taste really good. And the highlight of the shop, the kueh bakor ubi was just fantastic. It has the gummy and stretchy cassava in the middle and some crunchy burnt at the sides. It is not overly sweet, but just on the spot sweet taste.
The place is big and airy and looks new. The staff are heplful and efficient. I definitely like it here.
Parking is available at the front of the shop and surrounding area.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112863344573401896584/reviews
