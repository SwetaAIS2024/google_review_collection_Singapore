One thing I appreciate about this Mee Siam is that the owner squeezes the lime into it for you, instead of the usual practice where they give you a lime to squeeze yourself. The Mee Siam is of the Nonya type, and it was as tasty as Nonya Mee Siam can get. One complaint was the small portion for the $4 plate.",
