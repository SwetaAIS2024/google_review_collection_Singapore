Sarah Yusof,5,"I have stayed here at Marvelous Homestay last October during my family holiday at Johor Bahru.

The place was very clean, comfy! And most importantly i’m in love with the view from the balcony! My kids love the spacious swimming pool and indoor playground.

There are also many channels to choose from the HyppTV channel and the Wifi is very fast. Will definitely come again!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103574078736575562441/reviews
