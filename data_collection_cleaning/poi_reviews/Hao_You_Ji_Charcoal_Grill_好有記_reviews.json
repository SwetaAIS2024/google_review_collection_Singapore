But the meat could have been more tender in my view. The dang gui gravy is really good. They gave us complimentary corn ABC soup as well.",

Don't miss the dark color chilli sauce, it's very good.\n\nOne of the better roast meat stalls around Boon keng area in my opinion and easy to reach by MRT.",
