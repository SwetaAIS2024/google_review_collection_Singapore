      "text": "Nestled among new HDB flats in Punggol Cove, the Tiger and Elephant playground is a delightful addition to the neighborhood. The animal-themed design is not only adorable but also thoughtfully crafted to encourage active play.\n\nWhat stands out most is the excellent ventilation — the open layout allows for a steady breeze, making it comfortable even on warmer afternoons. Parents will appreciate the seating areas that are well-placed to keep an eye on the little ones.\n\nThe playground equipment is modern and caters to a range of ages. The structures were a big hit with our kids, and the entire area was clean and well-maintained. This playground is not just a fun spot for children — it’s a great gathering place for families, with exercise spots for the elderly.\n\nFor drivers visiting from other neighbourhoods, parking lots were easily available in the basement carpark. Take the stairs or lift up and one can easily find the playgrounds and exercise areas.",
