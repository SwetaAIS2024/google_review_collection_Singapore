      "text": "We changed our car battery at San Ming Huat Tyre & Battery on a Sunday late afternoon.  Very few tyre and battery shops are open on a Sunday afternoon. We were very happy when we called and was told they are open till 5 pm.  We were charged $200, which was fairly reasonable given that it was a Sunday. If we had called an onsite service, it would have cost more.\nThe owner, who attended to us, was very efficient, taking only about 10 mins to complete the job. He is a jovial guy. Prices are displayed on the wall, so it's transparent.",

      "text": "Paid $340 to change car battery to Varta AGM 70Ah 760A at their workshop. Was aware that some other places charge $20-$30 cheaper but since I was already there so I might as well just changed it to save time and effort instead going to another workshop. When I asked them to rotate my tyres as a bundle, they quoted me $30 including balancing. This is 50% more than what I usually paid at other places. So, I didn't proceed to rotate tyres.\n\nThey were efficient as they took about 30min to finish although it was their lunchtime. The boss told me there was no resetting needed as they plugged in another battery while changing. The boss said there is 1 year warranty for the battery. The boss also told me they are more comfortable servicing Japanese cars as they don't have the equipment/knowledge to do resetting of continental cars after servicing.",
