Denis,5,"Love the new look of this coffee shop! Awesome ventilation and lovely bright spaces! Friendly food servers and very helpful cleaning uncles too!

I brought my aunty to visit this coffee shop together and she too had a good impression of the new n better version of the hawker. ( She has been staying around the area for some time already)

We both enjoyed the variety of food a lot! This coffee shop really lives up to its reputation of having a rich culinary heritage, under one roof!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107269275231105198912/reviews
Angela Tay,3,"This coffee shop has a very nice mince pork noodles.
I went there at 1:30pm and they they sold out.
Then I decided to try this cuttlefish porridge but I opted for mee sua.

It said no msg, grandma style, broth is too salty.

$7.80 is very expensive for a bundle of mee sua, a few slices of sliced mushrooms, 1 scallop, sliced cuttlefish.
Is very small bowl.

Good to try but overrated,",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114575072489811038962/reviews

Xelcius,4,"Ordered the 7 dollar signature Bak chor mee. Personally I like the soup. Heavy and strong taste. The meat is tender. For the noodle part, I think I prepare non spicy. Although I am a heavy spicy eater, the taste doesn't feel right. Overall, if to queue for it, maybe I will give it a pass but if not much people, I will definitely eat it again.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115334482545035905254/reviews
Tim Q,1,Am here to eat 25 minced meat noodles. Got to say it’s AWESOME but this comment is more for the drinks store. The lady handling the counter was so blur and she had no idea what was happening. She did not know how to use the POS machine. and the guy who was making the drink was very interested in his own phone. Just buying drinks with 2 person in front of me took about 10 minutes. The queue only moved when another guy in black stepped in and tools over making the drinks. Would recommend bringing your own water bottle here.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115979506272872497828/reviews
