khaikhai123,4,"I prefer this nasi lemak near bedok.

A nasi lemak  need to consist a protein, an egg, fragrance pandan rice and 2 key components. ( The chilli sauce and ikan bills with peanuts

The lose a star due to the dry rice and lack of pandan favour in the rice.

The sambal chilli  and ikan bills are the  keys that made the customers keep coming back to order.

The chilli is not only spicy , but also sweet. I read previous review that the chilli sambal was bought  from supermarket  shelf. I checked with the owner and my own taste bud. I can confirmed the sambal chilli is their own made sambal.

Ikan bills  is just nice and they have a slight touch of spicy to keep the people wanting to have more.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116364248656767934/reviews
yongwee pang,4,"Tasty nasi lemak . Rice has nice coconut fragrance,  chili is spicy not too sweet. Chicken wing tender . Not the cheapest but worth it. $5.40 for egg+chicken wing + otah + ikan bilis + rice.

No queue on weekdays mornings",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109408994360112571115/reviews
Aik Peng Ng,3,Rice was fragrance but dry.  A little more water during cooking will do the job.  Ingredients were well fried and juicy.  I love their chilli sauce.  Price was on the high side and could be the reason for no queue during weekdays.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113242941318889107118/reviews
Victor Teo,1,"The most important part of a nasi lemak is rice and chilli. Rice is below average, chilli is off shelf type. I have stopped buying from this stall for a few years, and have given it a try today. Standard still not there.
