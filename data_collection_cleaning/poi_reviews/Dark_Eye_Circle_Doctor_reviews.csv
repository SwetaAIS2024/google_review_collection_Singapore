Jesslyn Choo,5,"I had been struggling with dark circles and puffiness around my eyes, so I decided to look for a solution. After researching online, I came across the Eyebag Doctor Novena by Dr. Choong. The reviews were positive so I thought it was worth giving it a try!

To make a long story short, I was amazed by how quickly and effectively the Novena worked. After just a few weeks, my eyes looked brighter, more even-toned and less puffy. Dr. Choong was also very patient in answering all of my questions during the pre and post consultation.

If you're looking for a solution to fix your eyebags, I highly recommend Eyebag Doctor in Novena. The results speak for themselves, and you won't be disappointed.
I'm so glad I found the Eyebag Doctor conveniently located in Novena; my eyes have never looked better! Highly recommend!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104165603758889307918/reviews
