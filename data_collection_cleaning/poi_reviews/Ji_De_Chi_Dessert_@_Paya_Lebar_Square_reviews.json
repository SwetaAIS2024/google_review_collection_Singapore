      "text": "The good: wide range of selection, with even traditional selection like sesame paste and yam paste. I had sesame paste with tang yuen and it was filled to the brim. Also great that it is not too sweet.\n\nThe bad: most likely the dessert is made somewhere else and reheat in the store when you order with microwave. The sesame paste is nice and smooth, but still a little off from childhood traditional taste. It is not bad, just have right expectations.",
