Every fish item served is accompanied with a well-written explanation of what the fish is - usually the chef just verbally explains it and I can’t hear anything haha.\n\nFelt right at home here and would definitely come back.\n\nCan park at the stadium opposite. Plenty of lots there!",

      "text": "Really true omakase experience. All the dishes are fantastic. They use fresh ingredients and know how to match different ingredients to balance the taste and texture. The plating skill is so good and looks too pretty to be eaten. The lady chef is knowledgeable on the different types of fishes, their taste, and texture. This is the first time when I had omakse, I know how the fish looked like as the restaurants had prepared picture cards of the fish. My friends and I had a great time enjoying our dinner at this little cosy place.",

The truffle oil could be a bit less on the dishes as it comes out pretty strong, there could be more changes to the standard items on the menu but I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The best has to be the scallop sushi, really creamy topping with sweet scallops and umani explosion while savouring the taste, it was perfect. That was the perfect piece.",

There were many variety of food that we tried for the first time.\n\nAll the food tasted great. The chef explained all the dishes and even showed us the pictures of the fish to explain.\n\nMy favourite was the oyster dish, uni sushi! The mentaiko prawn was really good.\n\nAt the end of the dishes while eating dessert they even gave birthday cake and sing song with us.\n\nVery pleasant experience and would recommend this place to others.",
