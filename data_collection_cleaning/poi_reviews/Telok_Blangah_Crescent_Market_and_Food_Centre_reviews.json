The hawker market selling authentic local favour of foods. Range from Chinese, Malay, Indian and local Western food. 80 per cent food are good. I had a local chinese mixed rice(which a choices of dishes mixed with rice)   the stall had a very nice creamy curry chicken. I had one meat(chicken meat) two veg, it's cost $4.50. Very generous portion! I were over fed! The market is clean and it's usually open for breakfast till late lunch(1430hrs) for most of the stalls. Washroom $0.10cent Singapore coin per entry.  Prices of all the stalls considering neighbour cost(starting from $2.50 or $3)",

So turn to this stall selling hokkien mee and turn out to be quite nice. $5 per plate, there are $8/$10 option available. For the $5, 3prawns were given, plenty of squid.",
