      "text": "My boy (2.5y old) joined the N1 class at Little Oxford Kembangan school from Jan to Apr 2022 (withdraw due to personal reasons). We rate the quality of Little Oxford 100/100. It was my son‚Äôs first school experience and he super enjoyed it. The teachers and the school principal were so nice and professional. My son was well taken care of and he learned a bunch of skills from the school that really surprised us. I can see my son‚Äôs development and progress every single day and sometimes he doesn‚Äôt even want to leave the school when we go pick him up in the evening. Overall, I fully recommend Little Oxford.",

Amazing staff with so much heart and caring mindset. Teachers really make an effort to engage kids and develop them in very individualised way.\nThe facility is well thought of room seperated to keep ages apart and structured so that teachers are able to help each other out.\nTeacher Sha is such a loving and understanding person. All teachers are awsome.\nI can see the growth and learning every day .\nPlease keep on the great job that you ladies do... üëç\nüíØ\n‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",
