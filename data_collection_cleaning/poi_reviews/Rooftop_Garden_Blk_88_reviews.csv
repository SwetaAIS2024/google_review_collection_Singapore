CK C,4,"You can take the lift that is located just outside Koufu to access this rooftop garden. It is located at level 5, on top of a multistory carpark. The view is not great but you can see the Commomwealth MRT station and the Tanglin Halt neighbourhood. There were not many flowers but the place was clean and spacious. There were also some exercise equipment.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
