Kho Jing,5,"I spend a lot of time sitting in front of the computer, and it started to take a toll on my body, especially with back pain and soreness. After a friend recommended Guo Tai, I decided to give it a try, and it was the best decision! Joelle at the reception was incredibly friendly, attentive, and welcoming. She made sure everything was arranged perfectly for me. The therapist was also very professional and skilled. After just a few sessions, my body felt lighter, and the pain was significantly reduced. I’m really grateful for their care and dedication. Highly recommend Guo Tai to anyone looking for effective body treatment!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100876520014864308902/reviews

Ella,5,"Had a great experience at Guo Tai TCM. The space is clean and calming felt more like a wellness lounge than a clinic. The practitioner really listened and tailored the treatment to how I was feeling. After a few sessions, I felt more rested, less tense, and more balanced overall. Definitely not a one size fits all approach, which I appreciated.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108205148249729520346/reviews
