Dr. V (Dr Ghib),2,"The fried rice was okay, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt worth the $12.50 price tag. For that cost, I expected a bit more in terms of quality and flavour. It felt more like ‚ÄúKing of Rip Off‚Äù rice than anything else. The crabmeat and tobiko were a nice touch, but overall it lacked the value I was hoping for. Not terrible, but there are certainly better options for this price point.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107383177799977353360/reviews

The pork cutlet was good üëç
