Marie-Antoine Carême,1,"Walao, I paid $7 for this bowl of salmon don. Never mind about the ridiculous price and disgusting appearance, the fish is super hard and overcooked. I can get 3x the quantity of food from a cai png store than this fake Japanese food store.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117729318138864850662/reviews
Manasi Nair,5,I absolutely loved the food here! I had the salmon with mentaiko and rice alongside fries and it was a great lunch out. The portions were particularly large considering the very affordable price. 10/10 would go again!,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113995531826989721282/reviews
Lynn Teo,4,"*edit - menu updated. $9.80 salmon mentai don

Ordered the spicy salmon mentai don. A tad too spicy for me. But the taste was good. A little too plain for $8.80. Will be good if it comes with some seaweed or pickled ginger (like how they serve in Japan). There isit much “char” taste although they torched the mentaiko Mayo sauce on top of the salmon. There’s some teriyaki sauce drizzled on the white jasmine rice. (Year 2022)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103665553977215246019/reviews
randall,3,"The mentai is decent, and they do give a lot of it. Although you can tell it's mostly just mayo, But for the venue and price can't complain too much.

The super unfortunate part is the sauce they put on the rice! It honestly spoils the dish, and I have no idea where they're getting it from or if the person making it made a massive mistake.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109975281303071622618/reviews
Kai,2,"Ordered the gyoza, soft shell crab, chicken and salmon mentaiko don

For the mentaiko don:
- Salmon skin is soggy
- Portion size is small
- No side dishes e.g. shredded cabbage, or seasoned seaweed
- Very plain, just rice and protein with mentaiko sauce.
- Mentaiko sauce is mainly mayo and on the saltish side.
- Mentaiko not burnt enough (It is called aburi for a reason)
- Turn jelat at the end of the meal, as no side dishes to mitigate the jelat-ness

Not worth the price due to the quality and portion size.

For gyoza:
- Slightly dry

For soft shell crab:
- Totally dry
- Crab size is small

Both side dishes ain't worth trying

Overall, a overhyped place offers disappointing meal.

Willing to try again if they improve.(Will follow up based on others google review)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117612273412230021726/reviews
