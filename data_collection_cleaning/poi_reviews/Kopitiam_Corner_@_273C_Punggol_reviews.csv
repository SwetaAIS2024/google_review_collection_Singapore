Desmond Soh,5,Followed this dessert stall staff from her former dessert stall where she worked to her own stall in this coffeeshop. Consistent delicious desserts and the chendol is easily the best I’ve had in Sg. A lot of effort goes in to ensure that every dessert tastes good.

theguy_withstuff,4,"Good atmosphere here, had the chicken rice and the soup was GREAT, the chicken is slightly less amazing but overall, food was good. In terms of being clean, it’s quite clean, no odd smell anything.

Siong Meng,1,"Typical neighborhood kopitiam but with decent foods. Like the noodle stall and believe is partnership of Fei Shiong. The ban Mian stall also has nice dumpling. But the economical veg rice stall has a short hair aunty who is very rule, like all eaters own her money. 19 Nov - Dropped two stars from the previous review. Food standard has dropped badly. Ordered the ginger with onion fish rice from the mix rice stall zhi char, I would say this the worst dish I ever had.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114075970380476081405/reviews
