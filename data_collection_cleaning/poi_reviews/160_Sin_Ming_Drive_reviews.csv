michael fun,1,"Fish soup with thick bee hoon. $5.80
Fish amount is good BUT it's not good fish like most stalls, it's a kind of lower rated fish that once u chew, the meat just break into pieces type.
Bee hoon is very little for this price.
Soup tastes more of a heavily artificially flavoured soup, than a fish soup.ðŸ‘Ž",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112556016843478534818/reviews
