florence lim,5,"I recently had the pleasure of undergoing surgery for my detached meniscus at Aptus Day Surgery, as most hospital could not accommodate an early slot for my injury to be fixed.
I cannot express how grateful I am for the exceptional care I received. From the moment I arrived, I was met with compassion and understanding, staff which greatly eased my pre-op anxiety.

The pre-operative care was immaculate. Nurse Esther took her time to attend to all of my needs, answering my questions and ensuring I felt comfortable every step of the way right up to anaesthesia.
Her patience and kindness made a world of difference.

Post-operatively, the entire team was dedicated to ensuring that I was well enough to be discharged even though I was throwing up quite a bit. Once I was well enough I had a session of physio at the day surgery so that I was braced for slow walking again.

They went above and beyond, even wheeling me to the taxi stand to ensure I got home safely.

Overall, Aptus Day Surgery is a five-star facility. I am immensely grateful for the care I received and would highly recommend it to anyone in need of surgery. Thank you, Aptus, for making my experience so pleasant!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109272722037789360192/reviews
Tiffany Teo,5,"I just wanted to take a moment to compliment the front counter staff. They were patient, friendly, and took the time to address all of my queries regarding the payment method when I was checking on behalf of my dad.
Their professionalism and helpfulness were greatly appreciated. Kudos to them for making the experience so pleasant!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110511181431770469216/reviews
Tom Allan,5,"Incredible surgery centre. The staff are amazing. I unfortunately had 3 operations in the space of 1 week with 2 over night stays and cannot speak highly enough of this place. The staff are amazing, the nurses are so kind and caring. The facilities are great. Very clean. If I never need digital attention again this will be where I will coming.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115670339843191565512/reviews
Abdul Muiz,1,"I had surgery with PRP treatment (tear tendon ligament) in this clinic, doctors were very nice and kind.
Went home in the afternoon, all ok until I woke up mid night with a lot of pain in my leg muscles that were treated and I couldnâ€™t walk. They did not give me any pain killers!! and I donâ€™t have one at home ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜¥. Staying awake with a lot of pain is a bit traumatic. Waiting for them to wake up and give me pain killer (if they will).

Disappointed with them for not thinking about post-surgery effect.

Please consider this carefully!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106695105892431005940/reviews
Shelley Ho,5,"Had a surgery today and the care given by the staff from registration till post surgery was excellent, especially Hamsa. I was feeling sleepy from the sedation and Hamsa was attentive to my needs and assisted me throughout with great bedside manners. I felt well taken care of and I would like to thank her for making it very comfortable for me.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108859281135876340047/reviews
