Jamie lee Malinit,5,"A Great Stay Despite the Cozy Quarters!
We recently stayed at this hotel and were thoroughly impressed with the service and convenience it offered. From the moment we arrived, the reception staff were fantastic – welcoming, efficient, and always ready to assist with a smile.
One aspect that truly stood out was the impeccable housekeeping. Every day, we returned to a spotless and tidied room, which made our stay so much more comfortable and enjoyable. It's clear that the housekeeping team takes great pride in their work.
The location is also a major plus. Being just a two-minute walk from the bus station made getting around incredibly easy and convenient for exploring the area. This accessibility was a huge benefit for us.
While the room itself was on the smaller side, it was undeniably clean and well-maintained. More importantly, we slept very well, which is always a top priority when traveling.
A quirky but appreciated bonus was the orange juice vending machine just outside the hotel. It was a refreshing and convenient option for a quick drink. Additionally, the abundance of mini marts in the vicinity made it easy to grab snacks and essentials.
Despite the compact room size, the excellent service, convenient location, and cleanliness made our stay a positive one. We highly recommend this hotel for travelers looking for a well-serviced and conveniently located base, especially if you prioritize cleanliness and easy access to public transport. We would definitely consider staying here again!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102466803262240666166/reviews

Room is clean and better than I expected!
Enough room for 2 peeps walk around and have a small sofa to chill during the night.
