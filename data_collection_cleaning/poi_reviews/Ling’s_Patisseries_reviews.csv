Srikala Asokan,5,Loved the pastries and drinks here. We had a strong latte (my husband likes it like that) and a nice cup of matcha latte. I had the pastries on display plus the spam bagels. All were so good. Will definitely come back to this hidden gem. Thanks for the tips on using grab to pay and get 15% discount. :),2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105442221413076355665/reviews
Bernie Chin,4,"Polo Garlic cream cheese bun was outstanding. Had the bagel too. The beef one, it was ok, not like wow or anything. And I feel the portion is also small, if compared to Two Men Bagel House. They use local coffee beans to make latte. Not bad, but not on the strong side.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109214621085246958273/reviews
Pin Tan,5,"The shio bun was definitely one of the best I‚Äôve tried in Singapore. It was slightly warmed up by the owner and it added so much flavour. The polo bun with curry chicken was yummy and buttery too. Just before I left I ordered the chrysanthemum goji berry ice cream too. It was yummy and not too sweet.

Go support when you are in the hood.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109621077357782695619/reviews
Rachel Er,5,"Repeated customer at Ling's. We love the bagels. Must order their polo buns, drop by on the weekends to enjoy the Garlic polo.

Cosy place to enjoy breakfast, brunch and even dinner.

Vivien,5,"A cozy cafe space that has just been recently renovated. The food was really good, tried the bagels (SS scrambled, beef)and the sourdough brownie (super rich and dense type). Will be back to try more of their goodies!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101517260335040317701/reviews
