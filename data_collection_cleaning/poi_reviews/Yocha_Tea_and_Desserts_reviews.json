      "text": "The ice creams are generally light in flavour, very refreshing, and not towards the creamier end. The chrysanthemum flavour is very unique and a must-try if it's available.\n\nThe waffle with 2 scopes of ice creams is on the costlier side, but it's certainly one of the better tasting and well-made waffles around. When coupled with the ice creams and maple syrup, it is fantastic.\n\nThe mix & match dessert bowl with aiyu jelly and taro balls is also very good.",

Not the cheapest but definitely one of the better tasting ones. It was also super crunchy and hot as it was made on the spot. Must try their waffle!\n\nTheir Earl grey milk tea had the taste of the tea but not the strongest tasting one. Price wise was OK ~$3.\n\nTheir staff didn't chase us away and we sat there for a whole afternoon which was great! A good place to chill in the neighbourhood",
