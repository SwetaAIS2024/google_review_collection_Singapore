When I went to them to ask what had happened, they insisted this is the correct amount, and refused to continue the conversation further, rudely.\n\nUsually a good spot, but very dissapointed with the food, and more so, service this time around.",

Before I accept the order, I already inform the delivery guy that there is missing item, I showed him the list and he just told me the store just gave me this. Call the store and ask and he left. Is this McD delivery driver trained to just say this? They donâ€™t check when the store pass them the items? Called the McD number and they tell me they will refund the missing item, I am not happy, I bought the meal for the cushion and now I have to pay for the items without the cushion. Terrible experience from the store.",
