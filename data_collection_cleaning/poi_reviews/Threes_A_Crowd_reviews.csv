Patrick Ee,5,"Gotten my Vanilla Christmas Log Cake from Three's A Crowd Cafe in Tampines during the Xmas period. Although late to review, would be doing a disservice if I don’t review at all!

his festive treat features a soft vanilla sponge rolled with a light, creamy ice cream filling. The cake is moist and not overly sweet, making it enjoyable even after a hearty meal. The presentation is charming, capturing the holiday spirit perfectly.

Friends and family who tried it loved it!

I recommend stopping by Three's A Crowd Cafe to enjoy their ice cream and waffles. 2 thumbs up!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100387807691818861627/reviews
Crabby Dancer,4,"Good choice if you live around the area.  They have interesting flavours like cereal milk and yam. The waffle is just so-so. Coffee is nice, with oat milk as an option.   Note that they don't serve water here.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100688349581284563658/reviews

Ravi,2,"Dear Three’s a Crowd Team,

I visited your outlet in Tampines on the 5th April 2025 during the heavy downpour, as the weather was perfect for some gelato/ice-cream. I was impressed by the variety of gelatos available and was eager to try a couple of flavors. However, when I inquired about taste testing, I was told that it was not allowed at your store in a blant manner. This left me disappointed, as many other gelato or ice cream cafes in Singapore offer small spoon tastings, which is quite a kind gesture standard practice I've known about.

Despite this, I decided to go ahead and order a scoop of pistachio gelato (which looked quite appealing) along with a tiramisu cake totaling up to $14. Before making the payment, I double-checked with your staff to confirm if I could get a refund for the gelato if it didn’t meet my expectations, to which I was told no. After trying afew spoons of the gelato, I found that it wasn't to my liking, which unfortunately left me feeling dissatisfied. Ofcourse every humans have a different taste bud and I don’t expect them to have a same liking . This would have resolved or helped a little by tasting it before confirming a purchase. I didn’t get the receipt of how much I actually paid for the small cup of 1 scoop gelato as I was already upset.

I would like to share a couple of points:

It would be appreciated if your staff could communicate such policies in a kinder manner, rather than bluntly stating there are no tastings.
I was quite surprised by the no-tasting policy, given the reviews I had read on Google, and it's unlike the approach taken by most gelato cafes in Singapore.
While I understand every business has its policies, I believe it would help your customers feel more valued if this aspect was reconsidered. Ultimately, it was a small disappointing experience, especially since I had been looking forward to a relaxing and enjoyable treat along with The Tiramisu cake which did boost up my mood abit. Cake was delicious.

Thank you for taking the time to read my feedback.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100339956523622471257/reviews
