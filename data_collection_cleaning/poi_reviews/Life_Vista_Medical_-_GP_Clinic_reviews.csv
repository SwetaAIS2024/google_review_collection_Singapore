Baezia,5,"There's an excellent clinic administrator who was very helpful and accurate with her advice on where and how to get blood and urine tests done. I felt very taken care of, which is rare for clinics in Singapore. Good impressions just from front-desk interaction. Didn't get her name because I was a little too shy to ask but I visited on Saturday, 6.30pm (18 Jan)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108142195796643777108/reviews
Wee Sean,5,"My daughter (2+ infant) comes here to visit the doctor whenever she does not feel well. Clinical staff is professional and helpful, and takes the extra step to ensure my spouse and I know how to take care of my child.

Doctors are professional and good at explaining the medical conditions to my spouse and I, and goes the extra step to ensure my daughter does not have an unpleasant experience at the doctors.

Will continue to visit this clinic as they really put parents at ease and help my child to not feel frightened.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103715770074593299663/reviews

Denise Chua,5,I am very satisfied and confident with Dr Lim after my 2 visits for the kneecap pain which has been bothering me for last 3 years. Dr Lim is a very patient doctor who will take time to explain about my condition after diagnosis. I have tried the Conjuran jab on the knees and pain have drastically reduced l. Staff are very helpful and friendly too. With much confidence in Dr Lim I have done the minimally invasive Rejuran jab on my face too which can help in regeneration of the collagen . The whole experience is a very comfortable and confident one,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110449911378495331853/reviews
Ray Ng,5,First time at the clinic and am quite heartened that both the clinic assistants and doctor are very patient and friendly! This is unlike some experiences I had at other clinics which seems somewhat rushed through and transactional-based.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105603680021978316073/reviews
