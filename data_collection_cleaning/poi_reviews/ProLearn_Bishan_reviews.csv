Jacqueline Kow,5,"My one year at ProLearn Bishan during Secondary 4 were transformative! Having failed my End-Of-Year examinations, I was in search for a miracle tuition aid to assist me in understanding Elementary Mathematics and Additional Mathematics.

With Teachers Elaine and Jiaqian's dedication and patience, they guided me through N-level A-Math and O-level E-Math. Their individualised approach in small groups allowed me to learn at my own pace and clarify doubts without hesitation. The result? My grades soared from F9 to A1!

If you're seeking a supportive and effective learning environment, ProLearn is the answer! Definitely recommend üëç",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115043916560124581831/reviews
Joann Lim,5,"Throughout my 2 years at ProLearn Bishan during my upper secondary years, I had a good experience here as a student! :)
I was taught N level A-math and O level E-math by teacher Elaine and teacher Jiaqian. Both of them are dedicated and patient, which enabled me to comfortably clarify my doubts. Additionally, the approach of individualised teaching within a small group setting helped me to be able to learn at my own pace. After my time at ProLearn, my grades have significantly improved from D7/U to A1.
Overall, I highly recommend ProLearn to anyone who is keen on looking for a centre to enrol in! üëçüèº",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115080508123558432357/reviews
