Tim Wee,4,"Wanted to have their sandwiches for lunch but was told that this & their breakfast were no longer available since 2020.
Bought some breads (see receipt) & tried a nibble of each. Yummy with a distinct sourdough flavour. Will visit again (soon ðŸ˜œ) to try the other breads & pastries.
Do visit early as breads sell out fast. Preferably before noon time to enjoy the full selection of breads & pastries.

Note to management: Do update your Google page so as to avoid disappointing customers. Thanks & kudos for your great tasting & authentic sourdough breads.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102658873358579406822/reviews

Sandra Aw,5,"Really is the best sour dough bread I have tasted in my life. We tried the olive garlic one and itâ€™s so savory.. the guy over the counter told us olive, tomato and jalapeÃ±o are the best seller.. the Kouign amann was also unexpectedly good, itâ€™s crunchy crispy on the outside with buttery soft swirl on the insideâ€¦ u will regret not buying more",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101138204889092244116/reviews

kar fuen,4,"Came here for the focaccia bread and sundried tomato sourdough, a big loaf of sourdough can last a few days of breakfast. Like that it is not hard and dense and still have some chewiness. The meat focaccia indeed look like roast pork appearance it comes with a nice crust. Asked for cutting of the sourdough. A simple shop for takeaway of excellent bakery product, donâ€™t expect too much of a service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100752167703559426034/reviews
