      "text": "Newly opened clinic in late August 2022, serving residents in the vicinity. Went on a Saturday evening, as my hubby was experiencing stomach discomfort.\n\nWhen we first approached the clinic, the signage was indicated “closed” but interior lights were on, so we went in and checked with the clinic staff. She immediately rectified the signage issue. There was no one in the clinic and 1 clinic staff manning the counter. Clinic is clean and well maintained. The whole process from registration and seeing doctor to medication collection took about 15 mins.\n\nMy hubby was diagnosed with food poisoning, and felt slightly better 15 mins after taking the given meds.",

She asked a question about my mensus history, i open my phone to check and she is very annoyed and ask, \"no need very accurate, just tell me roughly\". NO PATIENCE AT ALL.\nThe doctor told me, if I need IHP to book an appointment to the specialist for me, let the front desk know.\nWhen I am collecting my referral letter from the front desk, the receptionist asked me to book specialist on my own. I said, the doctor mentioned I can book through IHP by informing you. Then the receptionist said, okay IHP will contact you in 2-3 working days.\n\n4 working days later, I called the clinic and ask if there is any update from IHP. They told me they will check and call me back.\nNo call back, no update.\nI called IHP directly and was informed that there is no appointment request from the panel clinic under my profile.\nWhat a bad service from 1 Aljunied Medical.",
