      "text": "Nestled in Asia Square Food Court, the Vietnamese food stall has a simple ordering system. The rice with grilled pork and the dry noodles with chicken were just average. They didn‚Äôt taste as authentic as other Vietnamese restaurants. The pork didn‚Äôt look very appealing in one look. Considering the price is higher because of the location, expected it to be better. It still tasted good, but it was just ordinary. Lots room for improvement",

      "text": "Pretty authentic southern Vietnamese food, the availability of chili-oli sauce (Sa T·∫ø) is a good indicator. Besides well-known beef noodle (a.k.a Ph·ªü), I‚Äôd highly recommend to try crispy chicken noodle dry as video attached.\nSelf-order, the queue is always long but service is pretty efficient.\nThe only downside is the order machine is often out of paper, so no receipt. You better take a picture of your order number after making payment. I almost collected a wrong order as the other one looked so yummy than mine üòÅ",
