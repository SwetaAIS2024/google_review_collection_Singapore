      "text": "The food standard stayed pretty much the same after these years. Pretty good.\n\nThe counter staff were nice to advice against not having ice in the bandung as its too sweet. üëç\n\nWhen the food was ready, our buzzer did not go off. Believe due to low battery. One of the younger staff came over to find our buzzer. I have pet peeve of eating food that was left cold, and I snapped at him a little.\n\nI'm sorry young bro, its my bad. You were kind enough to come find us. üòû\n\nThe food was still a little warm, thankfully. Alls still good.\n\nWould visit again!",
