To√†n Long Qu√°ch,5,"So far the best one I have had in Singapore. Here why:

* Fragrant and fluffy rice üçö. Also not too wet not too dry, just nice.
* Well made chicken. Tender and juicy. The roasted one also have nice skins.
* Veggies are fresh.
* and the soup is just well seasoned. Almost all other chicken rice places in Singapore just put a bland bowl of soup, but here she made it super nice.

I roughly estimated that I must have had at least 100 chicken rice plates here, since 2019 and still counting.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101652060661055256348/reviews
Sufen Lee,5,"One of my favorite stalls at Adam Road FC. Repeat customer for their roasted chicken thigh rice. The rice is cooked perfectly - Á≤íÁ≤íÂàÜÊòé, not too oily, not too wet or not too dry.

Lady boss shared how she took time to figure out how to get her rice right at home. And the best way to have her chicken and rice if it's a take out.

Friendly and obliging owners. And I love the passion and spirit of excellence she have towards her food.

I told her how I loved her rice and she beamed. Do let her know if you like her food too. Dedicated hawkers deserve more praise to keep our local food alive.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101269803193723353169/reviews
