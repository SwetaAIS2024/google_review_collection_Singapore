nurul nadiah,1,"ordered something online and accidentally put sparkletot’s address and  staff scolded us for it. i couldn’t do anything as the website i got the item from had auto changed the location for delivery. family member went down to collect but staff showed an attitude. just to add on, the staff had a light coloured hair and the hair is long. please advice them on this as things like these could have been settled nicely.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103640441631346075890/reviews
