Susan Ng,5,"One of the hidden gems I recently found. Very very affordable food options with special mention to the fishball/minced meat noodles stall and the Fish soup/ban mian stall. Taste is good and portion is definitely value for money. Given the increase costs, they are still selling at such economical prices and maintaining the standards. Will definitely come again and hope more will continue to support them for them to upkeep this value",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115592153429655278003/reviews
Greg Tay,5,"Only one super stall here which is my favorite. The bak chor mee stall ( minced meat noodles ) stall is the best I tasted within 3km radius. Nothing beats this nearby. Some stalls like the chicken rice stall already closed due to inferior taste. But this stall has a queue most of the time. Die die must try. Oh... If you like pork lard in your noodles you have to request. By default it is not included due to health consciousness of singaporeans and older retirees living in the area.
Stall holder lady is very accomodating and pleasant. Not like some grumpy stall holders.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106016485464677542301/reviews
Angie Ling,4,"Recently opened, Teck Seng Bee Claypot Rice at this coffeeshop.  Was pretty surprised that the claypot rice was super good! Added the salted fish, and ordered the 梅菜扣肉 as well. It was a nice dish as well. Glad that Chai Chee has something nicer to eat!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115912021747467223459/reviews
TCH,4,"Many choice of local food in this kopitiam.  Chicken rice stall with promotion $2.50 a plate of chicken rice.

Tanjong Rhu Wanton Noodle looks quite popular.

I personally tried the e 37 Fishball noodle and BCM quite good!

However today I tried the Dim Sum; they have a bowl of porridge for $1.  So I ordered the porridge, Chee Cheong Fan and 2 Cha Siew Pau total $5+.  Had to say the Dim Sum tasted rather normal!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467592239988127131/reviews
