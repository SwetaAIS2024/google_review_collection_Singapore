      "text": "Perfect for what we liked to eat.  Unlike those other buffets where more is best, I don't see a point to have so many varieties and can't even try them all.\n\nThis place has a good balance of price and just the right dishes that we love to eat. Gives us focus to enjoy them.\n\nThe grill was excellent and for the first time for a bbq, the prawns were grilled perfectly, so perfect that the shells don't stick to the flesh. (Shells sticking the flesh typically is overcooked).  Compliments to the Chef!\n\nI feel they needed perhaps one more staff to handle the Saturday service but nonetheless they were really good, accommodating and super friendly.\n\nPerfect evening, celebrating my dad's 79th birthday!\n\nDogs are welcomed too which is a big bonus! Our border collie was a happy chappy.\n\nLove the vibe and environment, will be back again soon!",

Choose between seafood and meat.\nAt the buffet there are the traditional roast meats, seafood,decadent desserts and much more.\nWe also had some festive Christmas cocktails and mocktails while sitting outside surrounded by the lush greenery. We picked to sit inside their newly renovated Sanctuary Tearoom while dining.",

The set lunches were not only delicious but also offered great value for money.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Jason, Angela and the service staff. Their warm and helpful demeanor truly elevated the dining experience, making it even more memorable for the two seniors.\n\nThank you for providing such a wonderful dining experience. I look forward to my next visit and will definitely recommend the Tearoom to others.",
