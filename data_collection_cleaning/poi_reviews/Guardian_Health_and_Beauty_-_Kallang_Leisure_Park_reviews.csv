Parita Chitakasem,3,"Smaller than average, but convenient outlet which has most of the items you need from a drugstore. Be careful to check the receipt as some of the offers which are advertised at the shelf are not reflected in their system, so the cashier may charge you the original higher price by accident. Better to check the receipt to make sure.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102356148454609478796/reviews
L.,5,"Would love to compliment a lady cashier staff from this outlet. At around 2.45pm on 27/08 I entered the outlet and asked the lady staff if there‚Äôs Aveeno travel size for sale. She told me only left the baby series (which I already have). After wandering myself awhile, she asked me to the counter and passed me 2 of these travel size Aveeno Skin Relief which I was looking for. She told me these are free samples. I felt so lucky already as I‚Äôve been searching this series for my eczema child at many outlets to no avail, and she could have not bothered to let me know about the free samples too. This kind gesture is worth being mentioned. Thank you lady staff, you made my day.‚ù§Ô∏è",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115617956747134366721/reviews
