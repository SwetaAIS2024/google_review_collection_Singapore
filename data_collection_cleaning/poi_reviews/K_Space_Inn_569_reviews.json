      "text": "It's hard to choose the worst hostel in Singapore, but this one is in the top 3. Everything is self-service, so you won't see a soul, just instructions and warnings of fines that shouldn't be useful, so don't heed them. The only night I was there, a drunk and noisy guest who was actually drinking in the room made noise until very late. Another girl and I warned him several times, and he laughed. He had video calls until 12 am. The worst part was that I called reception several times (there's an intercom) and nothing happened. EVERYTHING is a toy, there are no plugs or anything functional in the capsule, which is actually made of cardboard. I felt really scared and changed beds, because I didn't want to sleep near an unbalanced drunk and I sent an email and WhatsApp at night with photos and evidence and they told me \"we are sorry. when we arrived the man had already left\" I left at 9 am and the drunk was still there, so the hostel staff worried about the matter around noon. What use are apologies, if for example the drunk had become violent? What does this hostel do in case of emergency? Fine for letting yourself be beaten by drunk guests?",

      "text": "Positive : Rooms are cleaned, bed sheets are cleaned, there is a fridge and a corridor with tables and plugs for working. Rooms are quite safe and for a short rental (2 nights), this is not so bad.\nNegative : Bathrooms are really dirty, it's a shame.  There is only one toilet available, bidet sprayers are broken so bring with you some tissue.. There is no hand soap anywhere.. (and of course no body soap or hair soap but i was not expecting so much..). Floor is quite dirty, the guests should have to leave their shoes at the entrance of the hostel. Carpets are black with a dead cockroach at the entrance of the door.\nMy advice concerns to any backpackers to not come in Singapore. The quality of hostels is very and more bad every years, they are taking advantages of the high demand of immigrants and tourists, prices are completely not in adequation with the quality of services. If you come on the end of june like me, you have to pay minimum 45-50 $ i guess to find an appropriate hostel.",
