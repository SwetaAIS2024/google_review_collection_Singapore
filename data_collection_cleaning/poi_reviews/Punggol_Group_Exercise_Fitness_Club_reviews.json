Terence, the trainer, was very prompt and helpful in providing me with the info that I requested. I signed up for my first trial work-out on the same day and it was just what I needed. The right intensity of workouts and abit of challenge to get my heart pumping. I was perspiring buckets after. The best part was the outdoor environment, participants who were very friendly and welcoming that made the evening very enjoyable.\n\nI will definitely join them again.",

Now that I'm back in the same area all I could think of was starting back with Coach Terence.\nHe motivates alot n let's us take it on our own pace. I loved his zumba classes when he use to have it. He is really a good n patient Coach!",
