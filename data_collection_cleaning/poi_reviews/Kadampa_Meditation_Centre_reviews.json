Have been going for the last few months and it’s brought about a big change in me. It’s very relaxing.",

I had called myself a Buddhist for a long time but I know Buddha's teachings superficially. Yet like learning golf, you need to learn to learn the right strokes from the very beginning from an experienced golf instructor, without correction later on. This is the place with the right lineage and therefore right teachings. I am speaking from personal experience.",
