Ian Fong,1,"Although its small nice and charming terminal, the efficiency and bus scheduling, are one of the most sub standard in singapore. Although the schedule shows a certain time of departure or arrival, the timing is always off, and it may even exceed 5 to 10 mintues. Not acceptable especially if we pride ourselves as one of the best public transport in the world.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100988869261745720065/reviews
jonathan,1,"The bus drivers in this interchange can sometime skip bus or come 5mins late. I hope SBS take note of this because this always happen and the bus app always put 3 mins despite waited for 5mins lol. To add on, just today , a 129 bus supposed to come 115pm but ended skipping and the next bus came at 130pm.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118071278025929992945/reviews
YTExotic27 (Flame2744),2,"quite small, i don't see a lot of people boarding the buses here and no bus guides here. the security guard is also very unfriendly. only good thing is that it's located next to a hawker centre.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106082080819174636793/reviews
