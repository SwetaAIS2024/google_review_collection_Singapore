      "text": "Love this place for Ê∞¥ÁÖÆÈ±º and Ê±§Èù¢ (noodle soup). Their Ê∞¥ÁÖÆÈ±º is aways piping hotüî• with lots of soy beansprouts and spiciness is just right for my little one. We have been coming here for years and generally no crowd at coffeeshop on evenings but can get crowded during lunch. The lady at the stall always make an effort to remember what we like and our orders. They can remember even if we don't visit for months.\n\nThe fried rice is decent too and prices are very affordable. What's most impressive is what they really go out of their way to help with your requests. We like to have our noodle soup only with the veg ingredient and they would accommodate.\n\nWorth checking out if you are in the area. The quiet of the place is an extra bonus as we don't like to squeeze.",

      "text": "Spicy and yummy mala at affordable price. About half the price of another recent place I went and I ordered more this time. Can use CDC vouchers some more! Ordered medium spicy and it was just bearable with a great numbing tongue feeling. Great to sweat it out on a cool rainy evening. A bit hard to get to if you don‚Äôt drive but parking is free and it‚Äôs not crowded which is great. Service is super fast and friendly. My go to mala place in the future‚Ä¶",

Will ask for less than xiao spicy next time!\nPrice was also amazingly affordable. Lady staff was very polite as well. Good food and good service!
