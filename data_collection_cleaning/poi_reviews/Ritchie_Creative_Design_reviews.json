Their workmanship is excellent, and they maintained steady progress despite our tight 2-month timeline for a full overhaul.\n\nRonald’s expertise shone through—he resolved on-site challenges with practical solutions. Wee’s meticulous eye for detail helped preempt potential issues, while Justin’s creative designs elevated the space.\n\nWhat impressed me most was their commitment to balancing client needs, quality, and deadlines. A top-tier interior design firm that delivers on its promises. Highly recommend!",
