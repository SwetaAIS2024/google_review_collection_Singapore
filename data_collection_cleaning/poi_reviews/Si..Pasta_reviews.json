Very polite and friendly service from the lady who took our orders.\n\nWe saw many customers patronized Si Pasta, definitely a good and healthy sign that Si Pasta is doing a good job. Keep it up Si Pasta.\n\nUnfortunately, the atmosphere was not that good due to the flies at Koufu. Hopefully, Koufu and all the stalls will step up the cleanliness of the place so that customers will have a more enjoyable dining experience.",
