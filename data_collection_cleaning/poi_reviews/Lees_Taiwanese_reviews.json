      "text": "First timers to this place must definitely try the Lee‚Äôs Signature Rice ($11.80) which is a great sampler dish offering iconic taiwanese staples.\n\nThe Signature Rice comes with FIVE sides ‚Äî braised meat, fried chicken , braised egg , braised tofu and preserved vegetables. Each side was well executed, they were all tasty but my favourite was the fried chicken. It was crispy yet still juicy and the light powder seasoning made it extra addictive.\n\nTopped up $4.60 for a side vegetable and winter melon tea (not pictured). Was pleasantly surprised by the vegetable as it seemed like they topped it with a bit of braised meat. Not to mention, the portion is actually enough for 2 pax so you can share this with your friend.\n\nWould be back to try their other dishes since it‚Äôs so affordable!\n\nüëâüèºüëâüèº Follow me on Instagram @littlemissramensg for more food reviews!",

The food was subpar, and the waitress seemed slightly impatient at our request for more vinegar in our heavily starchy mee sua. The bento set was poorly fried, with the flour coating soggy and stuck onto our rice. Only decent dish we had was the zha jiang noodles. The place was nice, but food just wasn‚Äôt it üòî",
