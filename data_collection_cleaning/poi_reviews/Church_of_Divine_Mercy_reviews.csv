Tran Minh Tuan,5,"A warm and impressed Roman Catholic church with one of the strangest crucified Jesus Christ I have ever seen. The only option for travel is the bus since the church does not locate near MRT station. The time for mass is as below:

+ Sunday (4 masses): 7 AM - 9 AM - 11.30 AM - 5.30 PM and one Saturday mass at 5.30 PM;
+ Weekdays: 6.30 AM - 6.15 PM
+ Public holidays: 8.00 AM.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107138955775511673051/reviews
