Angel Cheong,4,"It is a very nice environment here. This place is fully packed. The band is very engaging and they can sing many types of songs. Hokkien, Cantonese, English and Chinese songs. I went on Sunday and I love this band! The chicken wings are crispy and delicious. I love this Tom Yam mama seafood pot.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106414060291768557647/reviews
Nick,5,"SUCH A COOL PLACE! Look at me! This is the life. Chicken wings, live band, and really nice windy place! Do visit in the evenings from 7.30 pm onwards. There is a different live band everyday. The Saturday one is good. The crowd is singing along as I type this. So cool!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103527161898281171382/reviews
Julie Sin,5,"A more cooling place compared to its former location.

There are Mookata, Thai zichar and many other stalls. We ordered mainly from the Thai food stalls tonight. There is a fried porridge stall which looks like a zichar stall.

Note there is live band at 630 to 930pm. There was also a group of active seniors dancing away when we were there. Music is of course very loud and we just enjoyed the food without chatting.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105948443341037791792/reviews
Mantou,2,"It's looks so appetizing and cook and served by Thai, but unfortunately very disappointed. The Mama noodles not nice, and fish cake usually won't go wrong also disappointing.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118213126945726447138/reviews
Hwee Min Chong,5,"This place offers a variety of Thai dishes. Spicy steam sotong had 2 huge squids! Nice balance of sourness and spiciness and goes well with rice. The fried kang kong was an interesting twist to the usual sambal kang kong. The fried vegetable itself was rather tasteless. Hence, youâ€™ll need to eat it with the dipping sauce served on the side. Omelette minced pork has the good amount of fluff and eggy goodness.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117626203019572409617/reviews
