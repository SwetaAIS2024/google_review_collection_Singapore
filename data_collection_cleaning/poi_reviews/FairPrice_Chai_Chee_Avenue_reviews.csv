Rasidah Abdul Rahman,1,"It's Hari Raya festive,  it's nice to listen to the Hari Raya music to soak up the festive atmosphere. I have observed for several years that this branch turn on the Hari Raya music at a very low volume. It's either you turn up the volume of the Hari Raya music so that it is audible to your Muslim shoppers or you don't turn on the music at all. I noticed other fair price branches turn up the volume but not at this branch. While , Christmas and Lunar New Year you turn up the volume very high. Does the person in charge of the store in Chai Chee has issues with Muslim shoppers !!??",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115391063767414793801/reviews
Peter Hee,5,"My wife ordered a pork ribs / pork knuckle to add to our growing dishes of good for Christmas lunch.
When my wife collected the food at 1158 hrs ( 25 Dec 2024) there was only the miniscule pork ribs.. Pork knuckle was nowhere to be found.
The store manager, a lady by the name of Xiao Ling, was quick to remedy the situation by asking us to collect the ribs first and she undertook to ensure we get our pork knuckles.
We left NTUC Fairprice Chai Chee just with the ribs based on her berbsl assurance. Of course I was sceptical
At 1335 hrs, Xiao Ling was at our door, hand delivering the pork knuckle ( still warm) to us.
We found out that she had gone to the NTUC at Bedok Mall, signed for the pork knuckle there and delivered it to us. All this while relying on leg muscles and public bus service.
Now NTUC,  with such staff, do remember their G. E. M for irate customers, excellent customer service and with a smile on her face all the while.
This Xiao Ling deserved more than a "" good job"" done..",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106880466878330377798/reviews

George W (Oreo the Cat),1,"More often than not, the Meiji Plain Crackers that I buy from NTUC Fairprice Chai Chee are in pieces. I think it must be caused by rough handling of the products in transit or in the store. See photos attached. Almost all the packages are like this. Your staff must be made aware to handle such products with extra care. The next time I see the crackers in pieces when I open it, will Fairprice offer to replace my purchase with a new box of crackers?",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113159097227833060752/reviews
Lindy,1,"This FairPrice has rats. I’ve seen fat rats running around multiple times but management doesn’t seem bothered. Rats can carry many diseases including hantavirus, leptospirosis, lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV), Tularemia and Salmonella and yet the management allows rats to run along side with our groceries. Can management please engage pest control to terminate the rat problem asap.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115017034813668394269/reviews
