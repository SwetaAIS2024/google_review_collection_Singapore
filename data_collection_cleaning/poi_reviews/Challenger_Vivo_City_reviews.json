Despite the store’s policy that goods sold are not exchangeable, Richard took the time to understand my concerns about receiving a repeated gift. He went above and beyond by seeking approval from the store manager and even arranging for a replacement product from another store.\n\nThroughout the process, Richard was professional, courteous, and solution-oriented, making the experience smooth and pleasant. His dedication to customer satisfaction truly stands out, and I am grateful for his help.",

      "text": "Be careful asking the guy there in the TPlink corner. He is not friendly at all, i got scolded for asking the range of the wifi extender. As always I was using a low mild tone when asking the question to at least not being rude. Its my first time experience about this kind of rudeness. I am not sure if that guy is tired or what, regardless there is no valid reason to scold your customer just for asking a simple question. If you dont know the answer then can politely say \"im not sure\" i can accept that. Anyways there lots of challenger store here so i dont think its not the end since i can always go to diff store. Dont ever go to this store and buy TPLink not knowing what is the product specs else you will be scolded if you ask question \"Lesson from me and for me\"",
