      "text": "My family and I have been eating here for years. Never did a review before as I never took photos before. We like the place for the spaciousness, the service (the captains know us after all these years) and the warm smiles and  helpful staff.\n\nWe come here mostly on weekends for lunch and we'll get dim sum (all sorts over the years) plus some dishes. Most recently we've been getting roast duck and this time tea smoked duck. And then a vegetable dish or two, this time spinach with lily buds in superior stock (one of our favourites).\n\nThe dim sum (see pictures) could have been hotter (freshly steamed) but it's pretty much the standard here in S'pore (as compared to HK for example) so can't complain. All the dim sum was good except for the siew mai which was kind of hard and stuck together. The XO fried carrot cake was actually just warm when it arrived as well; very different from when we ordered it in the past. So can be better,\n\nThe tea smoked duck was excellent! First time we're having it, I think but three of us finished the duck after all the many plates of dim sum. We didn't do so well on the spinach but it was good too; we were just too full to finish it all.\n\nWe had egg tart to finish (no picture because we ate too fast) and that was also excellent. Flaky pastry and perfectly baked. If it wasn't so rich and sweet, I would likely have ordered another plate!\n\nOverall, another great meal here and we'll be back.",
