Hao Jun Chua,5,"A hole in wall coffee joint below a hdb flat.
Prices are on the lower side compared to other cafe.
Boss is always friendly and welcoming.

Coffee was great! Plenty of other option if you prefer non coffee.
My go to coffee spot if I want a quick fix of caffeine.

Downside is the lack of air-conditioning so it gets abit warm during hot days.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104663638936153648995/reviews

Olivia,5,"I highly recommend the mocha here. It’s not too sweet, and the chocolate flavor is refined—not like cheap chocolate! The seating is a bit limited, but it’s a great spot to drop by when you’re in the mood for a good coffee fix.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101166677750622474863/reviews

Alvin Lau,5,Pay a visit and support this local owned neighbourhood coffee place! A young chap who had many years experience of brewing coffee! Their coffee beans changed once/twice monthly! Their single origin with medium roast coffee is good to try! The owner is friendly and always open for coffee suggestions! His concept is to go for a chillax coffee place! Moreover you can get 1 free cup after purchasing 10 cups from him!,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114363387658244018275/reviews
