K K,4,"The local friends took me here to eat frogs porridge.
It was not very expensive and good quality.
I saw mainly local people and this is not touristic place. So that it is good place to come!

Monda S.,3,Consecutive Michelin star ü§î. It‚Äôs average. The sauce tasted about the same except a little variation: plain vs slightly spicy. Too liquified for me. Frog meat was fresh and porridge was cooked to the right texture. Stick to their main üê∏ dish and porridge.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101637225463540088196/reviews
Thanakorn Jornjarern,5,"The Geylang Lorong ‚Äú19‚Äù Frog Porridge

‚ÄúThe only recommended Michelin Frog Porridge in Singapore‚Äù

Frog porridge may sound unusual to some, but it's a dish I appreciate, especially since many of us in Thailand enjoy frog, even if we don't prepare it in the Singaporean way. For those who haven't tried it, it might seem intimidating at first, but I assure you, it's far tastier than you might expect, and you'll find it hard to stop eating once you start. The spicy version, in particular, pairs wonderfully with the smooth, plain rice porridge, and the sauce is simply fantastic. The texture of frog meat is similar to chicken, but it's even better because it's lean and naturally sticky, containing no fat at all. This dish is a must-have for me whenever I'm in Singapore, and I consider this particular spot to be the best among the popular places.

Chan Alvin,3,"Tried the 3 + 1 free portion today with porridge and rice.

Waited in line to order and the lady taking the order passed her duty to another lady, then another man, before it was ultimately passed back to her.

Through this process I waited 10 minutes trying to figure out who I should place my order with.

Now onto the food. Whilst the meat is really fresh, the sauce is really also much too sweet. Seems like too much sesame sauce was added.

Saw a lot of dine in and take away customers there and guess they have a fan base.

Not to my liking but probably will be challenged by the hardcore fans of this stall.

Price whilst not really expensive is not cheap either.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100974511028676415959/reviews
Cooper,5,"Had dinner here and tried the frog porridge‚Äîwhat a pleasant surprise to find it‚Äôs a Michelin-recommended spot, recognized from 2018 to 2024! Clearly, the competition for Geylang frog porridge is intense. This place seems to attract more locals, and even late at night, there‚Äôs a long queue outside. The portions here are generous and very reasonably priced. Salted egg yolk crab was only $50 per crab, and the frog porridge deal was $18 for two frogs with one free. Honestly, I regret spending $96 on chili crab and $9 per frog at another place before discovering this gem.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102217468384629834626/reviews
