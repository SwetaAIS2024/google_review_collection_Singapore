Jade Wang,1,"I used to enjoy having breakfast or afternoon tea with family and friend in toast box. This is first time I felt such a disappointment when I saw the breakfast served in toast box @yew tee point.  The portion was so small and totally different from the picture. The red bean soup served to my husband was just half of a small bowl. The peanut butter thick toast, was so thin and small! Same as the flossed toast!

Jasmine Ho (Luxiferette),4,"Cafe is smaller after renovation.
Air circulation is much better than before, no more ""greasey"" smell on the clothes after having my breaks there.
Service staff are very cheerful and nice as usual.
Still one of my favourite ToastBox outlet.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107824729496529629195/reviews
Daniel Ang,1,"This place deserve less than a star. I'll be contacting SFA after writing.
Starting from the customer service, the cashier lady in brown polo t-shirt was unnecessarily loud and kinda rude when asking for our orders.
Her colleague making coffee beside her tried to apologise on her behalf.

Next when looking for table we noticed that the empty tables were not sanitized when customers left. They only clear the plates and cups but never even wipe the table to clean the coffee/gravy/rice on the table. This was constant throughout our 30 min breakfast experience. I sounded this out to the lady clearing the table next to ours and she did start cleaning some tables.

Last the problem worse was the files, they were all over everywhere.
I can guarantee that there were at least 20 full sized adult files. Just my table alone had 7-8 buzzing around.
Almost every customers all around us were fighting them. Just read the other reviews. It's really that bad.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107764354744991028477/reviews
