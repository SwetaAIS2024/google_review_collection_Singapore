Sindhu Balasundaram,5,"I just wanted to take a moment to express my deep appreciation for the incredible nurses at ATA Medical. From the moment we arrived for our master checkup, we were met with such warmth and kindness. Each one of you made the whole process feel so smooth and comfortable, and we truly felt at ease.

Thank you for taking the time to patiently explain each step, as well as the numbers that appeared after every test result. Your thoroughness and attention to detail made the experience so much clearer. We also really appreciated how you informed us that the doctor would follow up for a more detailed review and gave us the flexibility to choose between an over-the-phone or face-to-face consultation.

We highly recommend ATA Medical for anyone seeking general consultations and yearly checkups. Your professionalism and care truly stand out!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101562907527163682080/reviews

debeeong,5,"Went for our flu jab today at lunchtime. We did the online pre-registration before arriving.  Impressive service upon arrival at the clinic - the entire process from registration to submitting of online consent form and then the jab and finally payment, all took less than 15 minutes! Super efficient and prompt. No long wait. The jab itself took only 1 second to be administered! The medical staff who attended to us was very professional and well-trained. And the clinic was well lit and very clean.ü§©",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109076510822517882213/reviews

Peace,5,"I had a seamless experience from scheduling my health screening appointment to my post-screening review. The medical team, from reception to the clinical team and Dr. Jana Lim, was exceptional. They were patient, attentive, and genuinely listened to my concerns and feedback. At each checks, the team explained clearly what they will be doing, checking, how it will be done, purpose of the tests etc I felt well cared for throughout the entire process. Thank you for the good experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103715435119962203145/reviews
