Most of the school staff are kind and understanding(except for SOME TEACHERS, but unless ur super unlucky u will meet the good teachers) and the canteen food is pretty good. Overall I will recommend this school is pretty good. Just be warned that the kids are a bit overcompetitive but other than that, I'd recommend this school! (Mrs tham best teacher)",
