      "text": "Tucked away in Changi Airport, Crystal Jade delivers a comforting taste of classic Chinese cuisine amidst the travel buzz. I tried the duck rice and a side of stir-fried pak choy, and both were excellent. The duck was beautifully roasted—tender meat with crispy, flavorful skin, served over fragrant rice that soaked up the rich sauce perfectly. The pak choy was fresh, vibrant, and just the right amount of garlicky crunch.\n\nService was efficient, and the setting was clean and relaxed—ideal for a satisfying meal before a flight. Great quality food and consistently good flavors. A dependable spot for a quick, authentic Chinese meal at the airport.",

      "text": "Food was good. All the dim sum items were good be it the siew mai, har gow, pan fried carrot cake and cha siu bao...they were done just the way we like it. The star was the beancurd roll. We would have ordered more if not rushed for time. We ordered 3 bowls of noodles e.g. duck, wanton and char siew. The noodles were done very nicely. Add the red chilli and it takes the food to the next level. The congee was done well too in Cantonese style. The meats were expectantly good and kept the standard of Cantonese roast. 2 thumbs up for service staff Lee Lee who was attentive to our needs though the place was quite busy and understaffed at the point of visit. She even asked if we would like to order some tarts to takeaway when we had finished our food.  Will visit again the next time we're in the terminal.",

      "text": "We always frequent this restaurant whenever we are at terminal 4. It was a vast experience from our last visit few months ago. Their dim had no chilli at all. We used to request for the dim sum chilli dou ban from their kitchen but today I was only given mala chilli and green cut chilli for dim sum. Crystal jade known to serve hongkong dim sum and noodles and roasted meats. Though this is an express outlet, I do not understand why u cannot serve chilli for dim sum.\n\nNext, their tea is no longer refillable.\n\nThey do not have chicken feet for dim sum. Forgot if they didn't have this dish since day one or recently. Very limited menu. Sell roasted duck and wanton noodles on menu but don't have roasted duck noodles.\n\nAnd I saw them brewing HOT Hong Kong milk tea in a PLASTIC container.\n\nEverything we asked for is no, no, no.\n\nThis time round, the after taste MSG was overpowering. Felt so thirsty after the meal till now, even after many cups of water.\n\nWill not visit again. Disappointed.",
