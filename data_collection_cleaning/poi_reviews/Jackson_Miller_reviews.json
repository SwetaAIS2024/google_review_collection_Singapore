This remains a lovely restaurant for food and dining. The beef as part of the set dinner was especially sumptuous last night. The service is always excellent here, and so is the wine. Thank you for making our celebration night yesterday a wonderful one üôèüèª",

      "text": "Date of visit. Saturday April 17th 2021 for dinner.\n\nThe service was relatively good. 9/10\n\nAssorted bread rolls (rasin, plain white, walnut grain) with butter was good. 9/10.\n\nMushroom soup was good, 9/10.\n\nEscargots was lacking in garlic and so was the toasted garlic bread. Add more garlic and it should be perfect. Rating 7/10.\n\nThe Tomahawk steak 1.4kg was a tad too tough - too chewy. The mushroom, kale and small whole potatoes were very good. Overal it did not impress. Do not think we will order this again. Tasted better ones else where. Rating 7/10 at best.\n\nThe Prime Roasted beef was better, soften than the tomahawk. However still too chewy. 7/10 rating at best.  The days of The Harbour Grill (predecessor to Jackson Miller) roasted prime rib was much better.\n\nSides : Caesar salad was so-so 6/10. Corn on the cob 9/10.  Asparagus was okay 7/10 rating.\n\nAppetizers : French oysters 7/10. We prefer the Canadian or Japanese ones that are fuller & creamery. So 7/10 rating.\n\nOne critical feedback, the waitress in black suit Ms Tran packed the left over steak as requested and retrieve the remaining bread rolls (2 of 3) saying no take aways and apparently to be ‚Äòrecycled‚Äô into the bread roll plastic bin. That is a hygiene issue especially during this on going pandemic. The club need to explain this odd service. What is wrong having to pack 2 remaining bread rolls (1 was consumed) that was served already, exposed for a good 45 mins though partially wrapped in cloth towel. Strange.\n\nAnother odd observation. Ms Tran upon receiving the oysters from the kitchen proper, started shifting the oysters with her bare fingers to make room to place the two dips on the bowl of ice along side the oysters. Perhaps to save an additional trip to our table? SMH.",
