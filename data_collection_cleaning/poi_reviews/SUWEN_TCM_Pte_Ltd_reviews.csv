Desmond Chang,5,"I recently visited Su Wen TCM for my back treatment, and I was truly impressed. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable throughout the process. The treatment has significantly improved my back after two sessions. The atmosphere was calming, which added to the overall positive experience.

I highly recommend Su Wen TCM to anyone looking to explore TCM. I will definitely be returning for future treatments!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117714346791927195564/reviews

Cheryl Ong,1,Location is ideal for a new neighbourhood but completely unprofessional service. My father went to this clinic for acupuncture and he came home with one of the needles still stuck on him??? Shouldn't it be SOP for the doctor to know how many needles were used and retrieved? They provided no service recovery for the error on their part. Would not recommend this clinic.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114800163056358917114/reviews
lun lun,5,"Happen to chance upon this TCM shop as I stay nearby and I’m glad I did.
I have always have frequent headaches and Panadol extra (2 pills) has always been the solution to this issue.
Until I start going to this TCM shop for Tui na. Each session is 60mins and it’s really torturing as I’ll need to endure the pain throughout. Despite calling out and telling her that it’s too pain, but she’ll say just tahan for awhile. But I never once regret going to them because I really feel better after every session.
On certain days, when my headache kicks in, I’ll make last minute call and she’ll try her best to accommodate and ask me to come down at 9pm to give me a 30mins session so as to ease my headache.
Really thankful I met them and I’ll highly recommend for you to try out their service. But bear in mind, the pain is real, but good!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110360097230783981355/reviews
赵凤云,5,"This is a Chinese medicine clinic for treatment. I have been following them. The massage therapist is very professional, and the Chinese medicine doctor is very careful. Their prices are reasonable. Cupping and Gua Sha are all included in the treatment fee, and there is no separate charge. I will continue to follow up",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102499861242037234516/reviews
