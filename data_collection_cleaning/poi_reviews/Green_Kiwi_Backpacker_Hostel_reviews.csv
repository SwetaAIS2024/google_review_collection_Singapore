Fitri G,5,"The service is consistently good. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean.  There's a rooftop hangout spot which is cozy and where I almost always meet new people. The price is very reasonable. I can always count on the Kiwi (now Rucksack Inn) as an inexpensive place to rest my head, and they've never let me down.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114126410964128920387/reviews
Matthew Dennett,5,"This place was good to stay at. The rooms are clean and tidy. The breakfast is quite simple, toast, tea and coffee but is free so I'm not complaining. This place has now joined or is at least working with the neighbouring hostel ruck sack inn.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106226082937754571286/reviews
James Ford,3,"Staff were lovely but the place was very dirty and run down. Didn't seem like anyone was really caring for the place anymore. Bit like a neglected house, broken ceiling tiles, cockroaches in the hallways, dirty toilets and usually empty soap dispensers. The rooftop garden had definitely seen better days and after a few days there I began to wonder if anyone was actually managing the place, apart from the front desk staff, who were very friendly and accommodating..",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109532588952675018475/reviews
Marfello Justin,5,"I visited and stayed here 5 years ago, back then I was still 11 years old and the staff was so friendly, the place was very cozy and I enjoyed the hospitality, this place was near to the MRT Station and the local supermarket. It wasn't that far from the airport too, It was a blast staying here. Fully recommend it! The room 5 years ago feels like more of a dormitory though because of the bunk beds, I dont know if anything changed nor this place is still open",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115831269348146901345/reviews
Jaz Hamilton,4,"A great value backpackers. The hosts were friendly and informative and the location is short walk to the MRT line; ideal for stopovers. Dorm room quality is average and the top garden is pretty tired, but it's a nice place to converse with other travellers.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105515514622013969306/reviews
