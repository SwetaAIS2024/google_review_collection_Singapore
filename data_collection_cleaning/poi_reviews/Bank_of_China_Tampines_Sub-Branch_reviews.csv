SAMUEL CHIANG,1,"Just open, long queue, wait 3 hours. Stupid bank, only just want to activate accounf due domain!Their account easily get domain and no notification! Only way to activate is bring NRIC down to branch. Now they eat up all my money with available balance zero due got freezed up. No transaction allowed! Worst bank. Awhile later increase wait more than 4hours! Really absurd! Why canâ€™t they emulate like other bank where u can activate domain account online thru internet banking? Now we have digital NRIC via Singpass.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104570832281699682828/reviews

No Name,1,"Waiting time is long and the teller's service is not up to standard. (Teller no: 4160407) She didn't explain how to use the app to link the account and digital token. I have wasted my time calling helpdesk the whole day to settle the issue. During the account application, she told me to download the app and wait for her but when the whole application end, she didn't help me on the apps. I also feel that the whole crew from this branch is unapproachable.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102942532776699409242/reviews
Meng Pok Thum,3,"Long waiting time, usually 1.5 hours, 2 to 3 hours during peak, go and queue before the bank open at 10.30am, then waiting time can be a  short 30 minutes",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117910893271871312647/reviews
Thoe Teck Seng,4,"Contrary to the negative reviews that is posted here, I was served by customer relation officer Cheong Yoke Kwan who is very patience & professional.She took the trouble in explaining the processes involved in new accounts registration. BOC has a more thorough detail protocols submission than other banks. As such the time consume for each customer is much longer. Generally I find the counter staff very friendly and approachable. It was a pleasant & fruitful banking for me. Thanks Mdm Cheong.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100305223117971744057/reviews
