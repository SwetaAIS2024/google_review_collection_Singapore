Zhang Er Lee,5,"Had a toothache and the Eunos branch suggested I come to the Geylang branch. It was super helpful of them to help me make a last minute appt and the Geylang branch called me directly to confirm. At first when they knew I may not make it at the indicated time slot, they even suggested to help me check with Aljunied branch. I‚Äôm impressed by their helpful and attentive service!
Turned out that I had gingivitis and needed an injection and gum treatment. Dr Wong is super experienced and I felt assured that I was in good hands and was at peace throughout the whole treatment process. The numbing cream helped to numb the sensation and I couldn‚Äôt feel the injection and the removal of infected gum tissue. The whole process was completed at around an hour.
Would greatly recommend Q&M for helping me!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113272812400381880085/reviews
