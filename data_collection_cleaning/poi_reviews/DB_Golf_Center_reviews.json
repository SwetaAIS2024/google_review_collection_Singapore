Apart from being a great coach, his enthusiasm, energy, and passion for the game of golf is contagious and I would certainly recommend him to an every golfer regardless of skill sets and handicap.",

Of all the coaches I have been to, he is the most knowledgeable in how the body works in the golf swing, and was able to identify what I had to prioritise on despite me having multiple swing faults. With all the great technology and his technicalities, he truly allowed me to gain so many insights on my swing and improve drastically. Best coach!",
