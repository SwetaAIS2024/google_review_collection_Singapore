Rafael Navarro,4,It is a good place for a ride as usual in Singapore is clean and full of trees and plants. I came a Tuesday (11:50 am ) and found it no so crowded. It also has a playground,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109171718785728989869/reviews
visqueraient,2,No issues with mountain bikes rented from here (perhaps as they are often used) however I had a very mixed experience with tandems. The service leaves a lot to be desired as well.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112405932165978190004/reviews
Ray Runner,1,"Served by grumpy uncle at this outlet.

The bicycle was heavily used. The head and taillights did not work. The gears were wonky and kept slipping.

My friend who also rented from GoCycling experienced his seat constantly slipping down.

The rental is not cheap either.

In summary, poor service and low quality and unreliable bicycle.

I would recommend HelloRyde or Anywheel over this.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118407887035187088442/reviews
Clarence Ow,5,"We came here to return our bike after riding all the way here from pasir ris.

The uncle here is chill and humorous.

We saw grey clouds in the sky and commented that it is going to rain.

The uncle simply says that even the whole singapore rain, here also wont rain.

He is absolutely correct, the grey cloud just pass by only.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112234615480628100933/reviews
