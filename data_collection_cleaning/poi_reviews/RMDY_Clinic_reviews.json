When I was looking to make another appointment with him, I saw he had set up RMDY clinic and didn't hesitate to book an appointment there. Amazingly, he remembered my name and kept my record. Dr Edwin is always happy to answer questions/concerns and is very passionate about preventive care.",

He goes the extra mile to ask more questions and dig deeper.\n\nHe asks about our medical history with great care and spots those little red flags for us. We really appreciate his professional approach and highly recommend Dr. Edwin's clinic.",
