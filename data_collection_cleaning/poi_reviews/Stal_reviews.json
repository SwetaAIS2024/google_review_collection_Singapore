      "text": "Responsive admin who answered me quickly before I panicked, and gave good advice how to maximise the space. Sufficient space for my people (about 30 ish). Room temperature just nice. Good caterer had enough space to set up. Most attendees are amused by the big figurines hahaha. Having your speaker sit on the monster bike to present is also a mood. We also rented the pool which is clean. Pool area has more than enough space for 25 of us. Maybe because of the previous night’s party, the room floor felt sticky. Overall good place to make an impression. 4/5. Visit us at @get_ecstatic on IG profile our 2023 highlights to see more pictures of the event held at this good venue",
