umake mehungry,4,"There was a time when we would make the journey all the way to Old Airport Road, braving the famously long queues, just for a bowl of Xin Mei Xiang‚Äôs comforting traditional Lor Mee. With their recent expansions, I‚Äôm thrilled to see this nostalgic taste becoming more accessible. Just last weekend, I had the chance to visit their Clementi branch. Today, they have grown to six outlets, located in Balestier, Clementi West, Holland Drive, Bishan, Tampines, and, of course, their iconic stall at Old Airport Road.

Xin Mei Xiang Lor Mee‚Äôs Clementi Outlet
In addition to the classic Lor Mee we know and love, Xin Mei Xiang has introduced a range of creative variations. These braised noodles are now paired with an array of toppings such as chicken cutlet, fish flakes, pork belly, and even scallops. Beyond their popularity with locals, they‚Äôve gained significant recognition, having been featured in the Michelin Guide and highlighted by various media outlets like Makansutra, Shin Min Daily News, CTrip, and Gourmet List.

A quick glance at the menu was all it took to spot our favorites, and we made our decision swiftly as the queue was growing. Here's what we ordered: four different variations of Lor Mee.

I‚Äôm quite accustomed to their signature bowl of traditional Lor Mee, which comes loaded with shredded fish, tender braised pork belly, crunchy bean sprouts, and a flavorful braised egg. All of this goodness is served over yellow noodles, perfectly soaking up the rich, gooey braised gravy.

Signature Lor Mee ÊãõÁâåÂç§Èù¢ - $6

Savor the best of both worlds with a combination of fried and shredded fish paired with braised noodles. This is a great option for those who prefer a fishy twist to the traditional bowl of Lor Mee.

Double Fish Lor Mee ÂèåÈ±ºÂç§Èù¢ - $6

The  Lor Mee dish beautifully showcases two distinct types of fish: crispy fried and tender shredded fish, offering a delightful mix of textures and flavours. The rich, savoury braised gravy ties everything together, making it a satisfying meal for fish lovers.

If you‚Äôre craving something fried, go for the Chicken Cutlet Lor Mee. The cutlet is deep-fried to golden perfection, making it a delicious complement to the bowl of savoury noodles.

Chicken Cutlet Lor Mee ÁÇ∏È∏°ÊâíÂç§Èù¢ - $5

The Chicken Cutlet Lor Mee offers a satisfying crunch with its perfectly golden, crispy cutlet. Drizzled with savoury gravy, it's an indulgent pairing that elevates the traditional Lor Mee experience.

The Scallop Lor Mee is a premium addition to the menu, standing out as the priciest option. It's a delightful twist on the traditional Lor Mee, featuring succulent scallops that elevate the dish to a more indulgent experience.

Xin Mei Xiang Scallop Lor Mee Êñ∞ÁæéÈ¶ôÊâáË¥ùÂç§Èù¢ - $8.50

Eager to sample a bit of everything, we added extras like Ngoh Hiong, chicken cutlet, and shredded fish to enhance each of our individual servings.

Overall, the taste was quite satisfying, bringing back nostalgic memories of our breakfast trips to Old Airport Road Food Centre.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111406931807185833571/reviews
Melody Ong-Goh,4,"I‚Äôve heard really good stuff about the Xin Mei Xiang Old Airport Lor Mee and was surprised to know they have now expanded to 6 outlets. I brought my mum and sis with me recently to check out the Clementi West outlet and we had a sumptuous meal in a clean and peaceful environment.

Xin Mei Xiang have won many awards including being included in the Michelin Guide, Makansutra and People‚Äôs Choice Awards.

Craving a bowl of flavorful Lor Mee that hits all the right notes? I love it with a generous amount of garlic, vinegar and chili for the full kick. We best enjoy the thick gravy with abundant ingredients and with a mix of yellow noodles and beehoon.

We tried the Signature, Crispy Fish and Braised Pork Lor Mee and I feel that the signature gave me the best of every bit. I hope to try the Hakka pork and scallop lor mee next time.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106306459754694107032/reviews
Willtravelforfood17,5,"Thicc and delicious lor mee on a rainy day at Xin Mei Xiang Zheng Zong Lor Mee really hit the spot! There are 5 outlets throughout Singapore now and they are also available on caterspot, foodline, foodpanda and GrabFood!

We tried their:

Signature Lor Mee - broth consistency was just right, not too thick, not too thin. Noodles were springy and well cooked and we had a generous topping of fish flakes and pork in it.

Double fish lor mee - loved the big, well-cooked chunks of cod fish

Braised pork lor mee - Pork was melt-in-the-mouth

Hakka fried pork belly - Really tasty, moreish and crunchy

Doris Tan,4,"Xin Mei Xiang Lor Mee

Heard a lot about XMX Lor Mee at old airport road so try this at Clementi West/ West Coast area instead.

Portion was big and suitable for carbs lovers.

Very interesting texture as the big bunch of taugeh (beans spouts) are nearly raw.

We didn‚Äôt manage to see the scallop option on the menu so we ordered the Signature ($6/$8), double fish ($6/$8), braised pork ($5/$7) and chicken cutlet ($5/$7) versions.

Might try the double fish Lor mee again in future as it includes fried fish which is a nice treat!
