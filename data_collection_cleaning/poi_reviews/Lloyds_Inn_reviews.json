Bathtub was big and tall, so the water level was alot higher than other hotels I've stayed at, making my stay even more enjoyable! Bath area was outdoor so it was a good new experience! Staff are friendly and welcoming too! Definitely highly recommended to stay here!",

Very close to Somerset metro station and to Orchard Road Street. Access to multiple tourist places or local restaurant/market is very easy. The included breakfast at the nearest coffee was delicious. Definitely will come back again",

      "text": "### **A Minimalist & Serene Stay at Lloyd‚Äôs Inn Singapore ‚Äì Great for Business Travelers**\n\nI stayed at **Lloyd‚Äôs Inn Singapore** during a **business trip**, and overall, it was a **comfortable and peaceful experience**. This boutique hotel is perfect for those who appreciate **a minimalist design, a quiet atmosphere, and a location close to shopping and dining options**.\n\n#### **The Stay ‚Äì Clean, Calm & Well-Located üè®**\nThe hotel‚Äôs **aesthetic is simple yet elegant**, with a nature-inspired, modern feel. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully designed for relaxation. **It‚Äôs an excellent choice for business travelers** or those looking for a peaceful retreat away from the city's hustle.\n\nOne of the major advantages of Lloyd‚Äôs Inn is its **location**‚Äîjust a short walk from **Orchard Road**, making it convenient for shopping, business meetings, and dining.\n\n#### **A Few Downsides üö™**\n- **Limited View from the Rooms** üèôÔ∏è ‚Äì While the rooms have windows, the view is mostly **a blank wall** rather than the cityscape or greenery, which might feel a little confined for some guests.\n- **No In-House Restaurant** üçΩÔ∏è ‚Äì The hotel does not provide its own breakfast, but they offer **vouchers for two nearby restaurants (500-700m away)**. This worked fine for me, but it may not be ideal for those who prefer a more convenient dining option.\n\n#### **Breakfast Experience ‚Äì Two Different Styles üç≥**\nLloyd‚Äôs Inn offers two choices for breakfast, each at a partner restaurant nearby:\n1. **Asian Breakfast** ‚Äì A great option for those who enjoy **local flavors**, offering a variety of rice and noodle dishes.\n2. **German Breakfast** ‚Äì A **Western-style** breakfast with a good selection of bread, eggs, and sausages. This was my preferred option as it was a bit more filling and balanced. **(Good experience at both locations!)**\n\n#### **Service & Facilities ‚öôÔ∏è**\nThe staff was **friendly and accommodating**, and I would rate the service **4/5**. However, I did encounter **a technical issue with the room lights** not turning on/off properly for two days. After informing the front desk, they **promptly assisted me and arranged a room change**, which was appreciated.\n\n#### **Local Guide Pro Tips üî•**\n‚úî **Great for business travelers or those seeking a quiet, minimalist retreat.**\n‚úî **If breakfast convenience is a priority, be prepared to walk to partner restaurants.**\n‚úî **Expect a peaceful, noise-free stay‚Äîbut don‚Äôt expect a city view from your window.**\n‚úî **If you experience any room issues, report them right away‚Äîstaff is responsive!**\n\n#### **Final Verdict**\nDespite a few minor inconveniences, **I would stay here again** for its **clean, quiet ambiance and great location** near Orchard Road. It‚Äôs a solid choice for business travelers and couples who appreciate **a peaceful, minimalist environment**.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚ú® **(4/5 ‚Äì A stylish and serene boutique hotel, but limited in-room views and no on-site breakfast.)**",

Overall, a great place to stay.\n\nThe only downside is - the location is a little bit out of the way into a quiet neighbourhood where you'd have to walk a decent amount from the nearest mrt station (Somerset).\n\nCheck it out!",
