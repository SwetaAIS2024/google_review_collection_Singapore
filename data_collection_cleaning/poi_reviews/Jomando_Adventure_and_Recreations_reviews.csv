Travel & Food,5,"Loved this store, as it has a wide variety of bicycles to choose from for your next adventure. If you are exploring Coney Island or the areas around, you should get an hourly or a whole day ride from Jomando. While you are at it pick up a conversation with Joe (the owner), he is super cool.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106053886224922371151/reviews
btb 2010,5,"We had a great experience renting bicycles from this shop! The uncle with white hair was extremely helpful and friendly—he gave us useful tips on where to go and even recommended the most suitable bicycles for us. The bikes were in excellent condition, and we thoroughly enjoyed our 90-minute ride. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a smooth and enjoyable cycling experience. We’ll definitely be back again!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113001044020897231192/reviews
Winnie Yeo,5,"I have visited this place on 2 different occasions. Both times the staff were friendly and honest.

The first time I went, the staff were really patient and honest. They not only helped the kids choose the bikes until the kids felt safe and stable. They also honestly told us to rent for an hour first, since we are unsure how long we would take to go to Coney island. Their bikes are also in a better condition compared to other bike shops I have been to.

The second time, I arrived before my friends. The weather looked very iffy and I wasn't sure whether we should proceed with cycling at Coney island. The staff there told me not to. And said that the rain is likely heading towards our direction and might be a heavy one. We heeded his advice and headed off. Shortly after, it really poured. Really appreciated the staff's honesty. He could have just rented us the bikes and not cared.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117032678701356981050/reviews
Liwei Chiang,4,"We were quite hesitant to visit because of all the scary reviews posted earlier. But glad we did. The shop owner might not have the sweetest smile in Punggol but he recommended bikes appropriately. He also adjusted the seat height for all of us and gave us advice that we won’t be make able to a round trip around Coney Island within an hour. Bikes were not brand new but felt reliable. The smallest bike chain dropped off in Coney Island, lucky for us that it was easy to fix. Would recommend this shop if you want to cycle around here. Of course, have to mention we come at the time when it was very quiet.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110831823629358579813/reviews
Nicole Kessler,5,"Had a wonderful experience with the owner of the shop. He was friendly and helpful. My 7 year old didn't know how to cycle and upon hearing this, the kind uncle gave us tips to help my son pick it up. We came back another day to try again and since it was a quiet weekday, he helped coach my son for a while too. Needless to say, my son could cycle on that second try. Thank you for such a pleasant experience.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104486180237277103741/reviews
