No idea about the meaning of the red gramophone-shaped ornament at the concourse level but it looks very unique.\n\nAnother thing I noticed with the new TE-Line stations is that path guides for queue aren't installed yet along the platform door. Perhaps the SMRT will do it some time later, especially after the JB Sentral-Woodlands North line completed (thus multiplies the ridership from the current base)?",

If you need to go to the embassies of China, Myanmar, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines or the UK High Commission, you should alight here (not at Napier), though it'll still be quite a walk",
