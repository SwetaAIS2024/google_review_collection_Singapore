Dj was great, it got busy at ~ 1 am but not cramped, drinks were reasonable and made quite strong so I’d say value for money. One big minus is the only ladies toilet but otherwise nothing negative",

      "text": "Came here for the Neon Lights festival afterparty. It was empty at 12.30AM, but I'm not sure if there's a crowd later. That's what the door lady said, but we didn't stay. The service was really bad - it was as if we owed the both of them money, and they talked to us really rudely which put us off. The main reason for the 1 star review.\nThe music inside was sort of electro, dance floor was big and I can imagine that it'd be nice if there was a crowd and the music was more danceable to, but it just wasn't my type of music, nor my friends'. Drinks were priced average at $15.\nHowever once again, what really put us off from this club was the way we were talked to.",

Most the tables were low sort- furnitures from the Chinese restaurant that operations during the day.\n\nOn a whole it was just meh. Dj seemed to have played more dark techno instead of house techno which could have brought about a better and more uplifting experience.",
