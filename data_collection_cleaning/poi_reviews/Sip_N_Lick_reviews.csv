Jen S,5,"Nice drinks and ice cream! Arrived just before closing when the teas were no longer available, and the owner(?) kindly explained this. Looked at the drinks menu and decided to get non-teas instead, and noticed the ice cream range was good too, so got ice cream. Surprised by the good taste and texture for the affordable price! Good service too. Thank you.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117521401971854690666/reviews
cheezey ryan,5,"Bought the Taiwan Milk tea with black pearls
Large was 3.7, medium is 2.7. Pearl was 50 cents
Quite cheap tbh. around same prices as I-tea :)
Very cosy, went after ""afterschool rush"" so no one.
Got the 50% sugar. was quite sweet but not overly sweet.
No ""old tea taste"". milk was decent
Pearl was not sweet which i feel is good as i dl sweet pearls
Very good location outside multiple schools and under hdb so targeting younger crowd.

Saw they have icecream but not that hungry so will try next time

Overall amazing for its price and quality wise is quite good almost as good as the premium places",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115914558954034253366/reviews
