Be aware that it can get quite hot in the afternoon.",

The great thing about it is that you can re-queue and go on the ride again if you want another chance of catching the animals. Be careful on the first drop as there will be quite a lot of water rushing in, lift your feet up if you don’t want wet feet!",

It cost 5 dollers which is quite expensive but with the membership you can go on it for free! You also can ride it unlimited times as long as you do not exit the ride. My only complain is that it took  too long to get off the ride.",

Though we do feel the boat moved a little too fast for us to enjoy the animal sightseeing.\n\nWe went on a weekend at about 12pm+ and there wasn't a crowd. By the time when we finish the 5 min ride, there was a long queue. Guess we were lucky!",

Due to the re-ride we get to see more and more animal as sometime these animal hides and not able to see all of them. Took us a few ride to get to see all the animals in action. For those who don’t want to be disappointed have to go for the multiple ride to see them.",
