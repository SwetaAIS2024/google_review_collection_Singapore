      "text": "I ordered crispy chicken bento set $8.50 but i was too hungry so I did not take photo. The food looked appealing. The chicken (I ordered no spicy) was nicely flavoured with the sour plum powder, I liked the pickles and all other ingredients were nice too. Unlike some of their competitors, they were not stingy about their chicken portion which made me feel that my $8.50 is worth and also gave me a surprise since I did not have high expectations. Plus the staff very good service, always polite and patient. Highly recommend!",

I never felt so appreciative when he served us so cheerfully and understanding when we came back to ask for slightly more chilli. Keep up the awesome work! Will definitely visit again. 4/5 LEEKS",
