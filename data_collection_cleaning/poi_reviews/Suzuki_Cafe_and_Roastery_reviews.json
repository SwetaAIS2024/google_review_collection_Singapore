      "text": "Truly hidden gems. Pretty little Cafe in between industrial building. We tried signature cold brew V60 Uganda it was good, can feel the difference to normal coffee. The latte also very nice, the milk doesnot dominate the coffee taste, balanced well. Atmospheres and decorations are truly outstanding. Parking is free just in front of cafe.",

      "text": "This was a gem of a find! Tucked in an industrial area. I’d never expect such a setup. Accessible by bus. Loads of parking space.\n\nWorth the trip!\nThe zen atmosphere is appealing. It would be less quieter during peak hours. Monitor this information on Google Maps. I’d recommend coming in between peak periods to enjoy the serenity and calm.\n\nThe decor gives a soothing ambience. The service crew are friendly and interactive so ask them about the pastries and desserts.\n\nThe coffee\nIt is well balanced. The roast is not acidic. Robust and nutty.",

They also help you to grind the beans so that was helpful. Was told Chowa which is the dark roast and yugen are for espresso while the rest is for filtered coffee so ask the staff if you are unsure what to get in your next visit.",

Just that today was kind of a bumper as 2 teams came in to discuss about work after me, which masked the soft music as their voices filled the place.\nService is definitely 5  stars! Friendly with a smile! Ordered take-aways and they are so considerate that they gave a fork and some napkins. And the paper bag is stylish unlike Starbucks. It looks very good for gifting.",

And the first impression into the cafe was the calm/ peaceful Japanese zen decor.\n\nThey are probably famed for their drip coffee, which we both decided not to go for, potentially to our regret. As it turned out, the latte and mocha were rather forgetable.. didn't quite leave an impression.\n\nLastly, the space is not a big one, and in case it gets crowded (if ever), it'll lose the aesthetic/ peaceful appeal. So, I suggest folks to get here during odd timings to enjoy the ambience more.",
