      "text": "Nasi lemak is very tasty, no doubt about it. But $25 nasi lemak for a small lobster seems overpriced but that is just my opinion.\n\nService is very slow. Ordered 1st round for dine in, it took some time but we thought maybe because the lobster need a longer time.\n\nThen ordered again 2 additional rice only for dine-in (all the rice we ate as I said it was tasty) and 4 packets of takeaways of chicken nasi lemak. They instead prepared all for takeaway.\n\nWhen we ask for the rice as we need it for dine-in, the young female order-taker wearing tudung rolled her eyes and said it‚Äôs not ready. Quality product indeed but service need to be much better.",
