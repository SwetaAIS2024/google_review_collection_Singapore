TIMOTHY WIMALA,5,"A very nice and even albeit slightly light wok hei on the thinner kway teow does not disappoint at all with the bouquet of flavors when evenly mixing the gravy and lard morsels. The ingredients are adequate and quite generous in this day and age for the price with whole prawns, and large bite sized slices of pork. Even the amount of Cai Xin is considered substantial for today's market. The thinner kway teow gives a very slight gelatinous texture compared to the broader version of kway teow and when lightly charred and mixed with the gravy and lard, I find this meal very fulfilling. I would rather support these kind of businesses that strive to deliver value and satisfaction while upholding the taste profile and texture. Honestly most of the wah tan hor outside is really just egg sauce without much thinking and hardly any ingredients. I would urge skeptics to really give these guys a try. Service was excellent with the 2 guys juggling  both ordering/billing and cooking duties really well.

The hokkien fried beehoon is a sleeper hit. There is a certain old world flavor to it that inspires a lot of nostalgia. You won't find any photos of it at the store but it gives a nice balance especially when paired with the wah tat hor. I am glad I gave it a go as well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111399091446826140845/reviews
Leon Kwang,4,"ÊúàÂÖâÊ≤≥ is really not bad at all!

Actually, we came to Katong Shopping Centre for the 2 banana üçå cake stalls and decided to have a late lunch (2:30pm on a Sunday) at the famed basement food court. 95% of the patrons at the packed food court were here for the ""Katong Delicious Chicken Rice"" and we felt intrigued enough to order some.

And while we waited (30-40 orders ahead of us), we got Tuck Kee Son's ÊúàÂÖâÊ≤≥ and we were suitably impressed. If we had not ordered that much chicken, we would have tried the other menu items.

In a nutshell, we'll be back for sure! :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,"Highly recommend Ipoh style food! The three fishes we had tonight were all so tasty. Glad we went with dish labelled A1, the Yu Kong Hor noodles with its delightful egg on top. The staff here were very friendly too despite being close to 830pm closing time. Really value for money! Cashless methods like PayNow well accepted here. We hope to be back again, thank you for tonight!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
I W,4,"Was at Katong Shopping Centre on a Sunday evening, and noticed that there were few viable eating options.  Decided to give this stall a try.

According to the person taking my order, Wat Tan Hor ($6.50) is one of their specialities.  I ordered that as well as Baby Octopus ($11.80) and Oyster Sauce Chye Sim ($4).

Wat Tan Hor was presented in bowl of thick, starchy gravy.  I am a huge fan of wok hei, especially when it comes to horfun.  There was faint wok hei in their horfun probably because it was ""neutralised"" by the thick starchy gravy.  I was rather ambivalent with this style of preparation. But can well imagine someone else liking this.

Taste 3.5/5.  Value 3.75/5

Baby Octopus:  The Octopus was on the tough side.  Would have been better if the dish had been steamed for a minute less.  Other than that, no complaints.  The Octopus was fresh.  Portion was okay.

Taste. 3.75/5.  Value. 3.5/5

Oyster Sauce Chye Sim - This dish was well executed.  Vegetables were fresh and not overcooked.  Their style of preparation enhanced the taste of the vegetables.  Portion seemed generous.

Taste 4.25/5.  Value 4.5/5

Was agonising whether to give this 3 or 4 stars.  Finally decided on 4 stars as I could imagine myself returning to this stall to try other dishes.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107686746966044708528/reviews
Justin Tan,2,"Response to the owner:

1. I grew up in Singapore and know that ÊúàÂÖâÊ≤≥ is not a Singapore concept.  It was through Instagram posts that I noticed this dish. I do not need to justify my beliefs. The unbeaten egg looks like the moon, ÊúàÂÖâ, and the Ê≤≥, refers to the flat rice noodles.

2. I am not a food critique, but I can cook well. I write honest reviews about my experiences,  debunking many Instagram posts where the content owner has been incentivised by the businesses without declaring them to be. Indeed, in your IG profile,  several posts include partnerships with content creators. Food critiques are not necessarily experts in the tastings of food.  They are enterprises,  driven by profits and incentives, examples being SethLui and Miss Tamchiak. I ignore their recommendations based on really awful experiences.

3. I do not expect you to sell at a loss. For the air-conditioned setting and the rents, you can charge higher prices. You can get Hor Fun for lower prices in HDB hawker centres or coffee shops.  I suggest you check out the Bedok area.

I came here for dinner in January 2025, after seeing an Instagram post about this eatery.  I decided to try the ÊúàÂÖâÊ≤≥, which is like hor fun, but with an unbeaten egg in the centre. This concept is, I believe,  from Malaysia. The hor fun is a type of skinny rice noodles which I do not consider suitable for wok frying. When I tasted the dish, there was slight bitterness, possibly due to overcooking. The portion was small, and there were only 2 pieces of prawns and a few slices of pork. The vegetables used were not choy sum, but spinach.  You get mostly the stems. For $6.30, it does not represent value for money. I won't be patronising this stall. There's air-conditioned seating in this venue.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115739474329491912284/reviews
