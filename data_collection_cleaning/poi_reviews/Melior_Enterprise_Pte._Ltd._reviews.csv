Yvette Ng,1,"Items purchase broken in less than three months of using and moving into new home. Hard to get servicing in busy schedule and hard to get to location with no response and no SELF lalamove option to make things easier if you have busy work life schedule . Buy only if you are willing to throw money away for bad after service and lack of response. Don’t even bother to email, it doesn’t work.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115413278570722161775/reviews
