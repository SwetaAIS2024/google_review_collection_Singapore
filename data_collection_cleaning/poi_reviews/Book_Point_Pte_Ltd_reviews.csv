Jacob Fernadaz,1,Highly overpriced. Some look like they were printed by them. No privacy. U got two staff staring at you. You will be scammed. They offer no refunds nor exchanges as soon as you pay,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111232161896075914923/reviews
Z.M.,1,"Yellow, stained and spotted books for 10% off original sticker prices HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA. To add to the joke, you have a rude and patronising owner: “So what you want, 3 for $10?!!”

What I want is to tell everyone I know to avoid this place. There are much better 2nd hand bookstores in Bras Basah to spend your time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113301019541003400464/reviews
kai,1,"Outrageous prices for books which are in very bad condition. I saw a lot of books where the price now is more expensive than the original, in no other shop I have ever seen this in my life. This is a second hand shop!!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103278317595245040012/reviews
Seung Hoon Oh,2,"Good selection but prices are unreasonable.

$25 for a used version of a book which retails at $29? Granted, it is out of print (only because there is a new updated version out).

Good variety and I hope visitors are willing to pay a pretty penny for whatever they seek.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117517294001691004949/reviews
takemi,3,"I found a rare book on this shop placed an order, item arrived and packaged nicely everything went good. The book itself is in a good condition, the one thing I REALLY don't like about it is the fact that THEY PUT ON STICKERS DIRECTLY ON THE BOOK. Both at the front and the back. Getting rid of the sticker and glue residue is not a very fun thing to do. I risk scratching the matte coated cover. Putting your store stickers on rare/collectable/antique books (which is what your store is all about) IS A BAD IDEA. Why your management think it's a good idea to do this IS BEYOND ME.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105842650840841012835/reviews
