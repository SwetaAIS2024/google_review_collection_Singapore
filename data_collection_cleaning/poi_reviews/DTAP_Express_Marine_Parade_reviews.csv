Emily C,5,"Overall: Highly recommended!
Doctor: I was initially sceptical as Dr Tan Wei Jie is new but I am so thankful to have seen him. He is very patient, kind and knowledgeable. He listens patiently to your concerns and is totally non-judgemental. He kindly said he doesn't want us to spend so he won't order unnecessary tests. He actually asked if I have time and said he likes to spend a full 30 minutes with his patients before dishing out medical advice to allay my worries. I feel so much better now! Highly recommend this doctor.
Appearance: The clinic is very clean and modern in design.
Front counter: A Chinese lady and an Indian lady. Both kind and friendly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106841314522287552530/reviews
Avaneesh Selvamani,5,"Highly Recommend DTAP Express! Came here to get my Hep B Jab and it was very efficient. Finished everything within 15 minutes too.

caralyn c,1,"Went for a consultation a few weeks back and I'm disappointed to say that the service I received has been awful. Paid $62 for the initial consultation, and Dr. Ezlyn insisted I take a test costing an additional $269. When the results came back negative, my symptoms persisted. I informed the doctor, but she dismissed my concerns. Furthermore, despite my stating I have no sexual partners, she assumed I had a sexually transmitted disease and didn't believe me. I'm deeply disappointed to have paid close to $300 to receive zero professional advice from this clinic. It was a complete waste of time and money, and I 100% would not recommend visiting.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109896126131737880801/reviews
Zikri Zainudin,5,"Dr Tanâ€™s expertise and knowledge were evident in the way he listened attentively to my concerns and provided thoughtful explanations for the treatment options available.

Throughout my experience, Dr. Tan also demonstrated genuine care and compassion, making sure I felt comfortable and understood every step of the way. His attention to detail and commitment to delivering the best possible care is truly commendable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112301731782552829655/reviews
