      "text": "I have chronic migraines that seem to be related to my menstrual cycle, so I started seeing Physician Ho in mid 2022. Both my migraines and menstrual symptoms have greatly improved since. I appreciated that Thomson TCM and her seemed to specialise in women's health, whereas the TCM practitioners I had seen before were more generalist. I am thankful to Physician Ho for always taking the time to explain when I ask questions, and she keeps a very open mind when we discuss health interventions that may not be TCM related.\n\nMy health had a setback when I had gotten covid in mid 2023, and Physician Ho nursed me back to health again. Each time I had different health issues – even a tooth infection that required antibiotics, I relied on Physician Ho to restore the homeostatic balance in my body. And of course I have to mention Shirley, who has been very kind and helpful to me too, especially sometimes when I have to reschedule my appointments. Grateful for the care over the years.",
