Fun Kwok,4,"Toast box standard is pretty much constant.
Prices are kind of a tad higher than the other coffee places.

This toast box has a lot of art in the premises. Even the ceiling has a lot of cherubs painting on it.

Service was prompt and food was good. I think the festive reindeer cake was nice, although it had quite abit of cream on it. But the kids love it.

The drink size is big which is comparable to the price point of the drink. The curry was good, but is 3 pieces of chicken wing really enough. I do hope that the number of chicken wings in the curry do not get reduced in view of all the food prices hike.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102827686654539049214/reviews

Andrea Tan,3,"Came on a weekday evening, and the breadtalk side of the store was closed. Only the toastbox side is open. Portions are okay for the price as we had a voucher. However, do note that the curry chicken set costs $2 more than other outlets around SG.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105860376252278587604/reviews
