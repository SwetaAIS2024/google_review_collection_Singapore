Rachel,5,"Really sweet lady who will give advice on how best to mend your outfit. I brought a coat that had a torn inner lining, she assessed it, gave me a quote and ask me to consider if it's worth fixing or better to buy a new coat. Very honest with no hard sell :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104563032232154354307/reviews
