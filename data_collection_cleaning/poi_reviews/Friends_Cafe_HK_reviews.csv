Keng Cheong Tan,4,Authentic HK comfort food in an old-school setting. Ambience is good for group settings. The chicken baked rice in a tomato cheese gravy was piping hot and full of flavour. The curry fish balls were acceptable but the balls were quite small with little gravy. The chicken chops were great and freshly cooked. Drinks are decent.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102762619432424724330/reviews
Lee,2,"Came at 4.45pm. No crowd.
Very basic and instant food. Explains prompt service.
Do not expect normal HK milk tea, if you want sugar, ask for the sachet.
Can give pandan milk tea a miss.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109335508978658529038/reviews
Tony Tai,1,"Food was generally ok. Baked spaghetti however tasted blend and is only saved by the pork chop.
Pricing is decent but somehow we have a bad service experience today.
Was asked to sit at a table which looks reserved and I eventually asked for a change. Fortunately so as the gp came in like 10mins later . Bad decision by the supervisor
At check out … was reaching the counter to pay and saw my bill flashed but suddenly someone came cutting in and the ‘supervisor’ changed to her bill coz likely a regular as they were chatting all e way over dinner .
Poor customer service and low EQ in dealing with customer.
Will not come again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110884771797111049431/reviews
Chi Hong Hwang,5,"This was highly recommended to us by a friend for serving authentic HK food. The food did not disappoint! My favourite was the hot plate beef and the clams! Also the black sesame paste is one of the best I have eaten in Singapore. Can taste the black sesame and not starchy, also not too sweet. The server Ah Yong served enthusiastically from the time we arrived till we left. He gave us many suggestions and was open to feedback that we gave. The other youngan serving us was also quiet but smiley and obliging. The eatery and the utensils were all authentic to a HK Ice Eatery （冰室）Overall excellent and certainly will return.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103614009093464438172/reviews
Wei Ghee Ng,4,"Homely and authentic deco
Wife didn't like the baked rice with pork chop
