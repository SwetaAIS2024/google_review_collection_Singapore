      "text": "The best swimming club, strongly recommended to those seeking improvement in swimming techniques and stamina for children in competitive swimming. Tao Li now offers two locations for trainings, the short course pool at Sembawang is a great addition to the long course pool at Temasek, for different training purposes. Coaches are professional and pay attentions to every detail in daily training sessions. My kids attend trainings at both locations, they are highly motivated by coaches and absolutely enjoy trainings at Tao Li.",

Everything was clearly communicate beforehand in regards to my son experience in swimming, he is just 2.5 yrs old. Never had any formal swimming lesson before and want to pick up swimming. Definitely he is FEARFUL and knew nothing at all.\n\nThere was no attempt at all to bring him back to class and he was just playing at the baby pool himself. 45mins past like this and there goes the trial...\n\nIf you are for competitive swimming, it might be for you. But to learn swimming, please avoid here.",
