Ravish M,4,Good experience to travel by the bus to JOHOR Bahru. The bus stop is pretty easy to spot except little confusing for the different buses arriving and departing. You must be careful and alert to spot your bus. Thought conductor will help you to advise on your route but it could be messy during the peak hours,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116138807654098240752/reviews
Dachaini Baskaran,1,"DONT DESERVE any STAR for the service via 2nd link towards Gelang Patah/Bukit Indah/Perling/Sutera Mall.. the worst transportation mode ever from 2nd Link JB customs towards mentioned places. Just because CW doesnâ€™t have competitors at this point, their service really sucks!!! No GRAB or Personal pick ups allowed into this point..the only and sole transportation is this bloody CW Yellow bus!!! Buses keeps on moving with no pick up on passenger who been waiting for more than half an hour..the drivers just ride off the bus EMPTY but the ppl waiting in LONG Q!!! I hope someone would start another bus company for this point!!! Which nvr would happen, disappointment!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112152855368904402658/reviews
