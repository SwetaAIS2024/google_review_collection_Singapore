Twinkle Vangie,1,"Very dishonest staff. Do check for overpricing.  They overcharged each time and did not honor the rice garden pricing according to the color tags for ntuc members. Even if non member, clearly is overcharging.. Felt con by the staff  -  tofu with very little meat,  2 green veg  - $5.20. When I asked to the staff serving, he sounded very loud and angry.  Please avoid this stall if possible.
