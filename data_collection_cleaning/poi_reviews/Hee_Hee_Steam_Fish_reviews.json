Have previously tried the steamed seafood sets at Hee Hee Hee Steamed Fish in Toa Payoh, super stoked it has opened an outlet in Clementi! The Golden Pomfret üêüserved Hong Kong style was very fresh considering it‚Äôs in a hawker setting, meat was supple and the flavors enhanced by the soy sauce, ginger and minced garlic! Each set also comes with two dipping sauces to add that extra kick to your fresh seafood!\n\nAlso got the BB‚Äôs parents seal of approval (quote BB papa: ‚Äútastes like BB mama‚Äôs cooking‚Äù) after recommending to them! Other seafood options available include Grouper & Bamboo Clams!\n.\nüìçAddress: Gourmet Street, 431 Clementi Ave 3, Block 431, Singapore 120431\n.\n.\n#shiok #jiaklocal #sgfoodporn #sgfoodlover #sgfoodtrend #burpplesg #singaporeforeveryone #wantwoeatsg #sghawker #hawkerfoodsg #sgeats",

I recommend the nai bai over the okra as the okra releases its soluble fibre, which can be unpleasant to some due to it's wet/soggy texture\n\nHawker was very friendly and gave us extra coriander and spring onions !\n\nOverall a great experience, would definitely come again :)",
