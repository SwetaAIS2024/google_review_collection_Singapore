Sean Poon,5,"PU TIAN WEI a must try. I had ordered the fried bee hoon, fried rice, and Lychee Pork. Chinese cuisine fried rice and bee hoon is notoriously hard to master. Yet the Chef had aced both. The pork chop that came with the fried rice is extremely tender. His chilli sauce is a perfectly match to the fried rice and bee hoon. Although Lychee Pork is an average affair. The price point is good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104302598059978578735/reviews

Cheryl Lim,4,"1) Drink store had fruit juices and deserts (Aiyu, Grass jelly) on the menu but they said they were out of all of them on the day I went (29/07/23). Ordered their ice lemon tea instead but it was absurdly sweet

2) Fishball noodles were quite good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104772352309308188418/reviews
