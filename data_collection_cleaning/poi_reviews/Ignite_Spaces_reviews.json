Note they have quite a huge collection of board games (and some are new!!!)\nGet the arena pass as it’s one entry price for the whole day (until they close shop) & they have small private rooms for up to 4 people;\nGreat place for hanging out with friends and team building (or when you didn’t get to do prawning downstairs)\nCurrently there’s a free drink promotion for first visit & 20% off",
