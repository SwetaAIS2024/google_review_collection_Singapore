      "text": "I have been a supporter of this Mookata before they shifted to this new unit. The last unit was nearer to the Caltex Petrol Station. Now it has shifted further away from the Caltex station with renovation. The boss shared that for the previous unit, the landlord changed hands and rental went up exorbitantly by 150%. Therefore they have to shift.\n\nRenovation was much nicer as compared to the previous unrenovated unit. The only shortfall was the aircon wasn‚Äôt as cooling as I wish it to be.\n\nThere are buffet stations for patrons to self serve if they opted for the normal Mookata Buffet. If you opt for the Premium Buffet, you will need to scan a QR code to select the premium dishes and they will serve it to your table. However, for other dishes besides the premium dishes, you also have to self serve at the buffet stations.\n\nThe premium dishes consists of some good quality beef, salmon, tiger prawns, crayfish, huge succulent oysters, lala, mussels, clams, fish etc.\n\nThe boss is very friendly and spends time chit chatting with patrons, asking them for feedback to improve their quality and review. I told the boss I was a regular customer prior to them shifting and renovating.\n\nThey have an option of $5 drink where it is refillable and you have 5 options of drink choices-lemongrass, water chestnut, Thai milk tea, Thai green milk tea and I forgot the last. Haha\n\nüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",

Their chili comes with different spice levels.\n\nEvery table has its own exhaust. So no BBQ smell. Cosy and spacious environment. Friendly and helpful staff.\n\nDefinitely a great place for family and gatherings with friends.",

      "text": "First time here for their mookata buffet. Honestly, was abit worried as trying the mookata here for CNY reunion dinner. But it turned out great, better than expected.\n\nCosy environment, wasn‚Äôt too smoky and was not stuffy. Had the standard buffet for 4 pax. Spread was enough, there were marinated chicken and pork, clams and mussels. Free flow thai milk tea was priced affordably. Oh, there‚Äôs ice cream included too!\n\nWhat made this place better than expected was the amazing service from the boss and his service staff. Attentive, approachable and super friendly.\n\nThank you for tonight, hope to be back soon. Wishing the boss and his team the very best in 2025. Heng Ong Huat ah!",
