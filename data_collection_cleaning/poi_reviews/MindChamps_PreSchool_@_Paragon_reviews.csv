Raine Du,5,"Thank you to N2 teachers Ms Jac, Yang Laoshi, Ms Winnie, & the team of teachers led by Principal Shermaine. Sch admin Jasmine is always friendly & helpful to parents as well. My boys enjoy going to school & I see them using more vacabulary & increased confidence in using both English & Chinese at home. The teachers are always very responsive & supportive of our needs. The curriculum is structured & well established. We always receive timely updates of our childrens' learnings including photos of their activities. I appreciate the school organising parent child bonding activities & excursions as well. Thank you Mindchamps team @ Paragon!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101627320987828845965/reviews

Eva Tan,5,"Attended the workshop held by the school to understand the lessons. Shoutout to Principal Ms Shermaine, Ma Laoshi, Ms Nur, Ms Anies, Ms Jacqueline and Teacher Tobby! And not to forget Ms Jasmine.

Great to know  the fun music lesson the kids had in school and my kid is so happy when I sing the bear monkey song. Thanks to the school for organizing and Teacher Tobby who is leading the class.

Also, special thanks to Ma Laoshi who guide my son in learning Chinese Language which he is less exposed to.

Natalia Lidya,5,"Today marked the end of our son’s preschool journey. Reflecting on the past five years, we thank God for choosing MindChamps Paragon. Initially, we didn’t consider it due to the premium cost, but we’re glad we did. We even forgo the deposit we had paid to another preschool closer to our house.
The visit to the centre itself was a random visit while we are waiting for our PD appointment. As we stepped inside the preschool, we immediately captivated by the warm welcome from Miss Jasmine, the admin, and the principal back then. We observed the harmonious interactions between the champs, from the youngest to the eldest, like a family. The teachers at MindChamps Paragon may appear young and inexperienced, but all the champs love them. Their passion, energy, and love for champs are evident.
Fast forward to today, we wanted to express our deepest gratitude to all the teachers, assistant teachers, current principal, vice principal, and admin who have played a pivotal role in our son’s preschool life. Your contributions have made our parenting journey easier and more fulfilling. We firmly believe that it takes a village to raise a child, and constant and open communication, coupled with trust between teachers and children, are crucial.
We extend our heartfelt appreciation to all the teams at MindChamps Paragon, especially Fan Laoshi, Miss Eunice, Hsu Laoshi, Miss Jaslyn, Lin Laoshi, Miss Sherlyn, Bing2 Laoshi, Miss Jacqueline, Miss Jasmine, Miss Shermaine. Keep up the exceptional teamwork and excel in your areas of expertise. We will undoubtedly miss each one of you.
Lastly, to parents still considering a childcare/PreSchool option, we strongly recommend visiting MindChamps Paragon. Trust us, you won’t regret it.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115797493860157608782/reviews
