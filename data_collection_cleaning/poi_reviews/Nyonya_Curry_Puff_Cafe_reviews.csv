Joey Low,5,"Tasty curry puff with solid filling. Pastry is crispy. Giant fishball is nice and juicy. Goreng pisang is good too! Definitely a must to try.

FoodieDirectory,3,Curry puff was average. Canâ€™t beat the more established Brands. But the discovery of the day was the fried banana. Really sweet on inside and light crispy batter on outside.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114040935321134660301/reviews
H,5,"We have been frequenting this shop since almost 10 years ago. They sell one of the most delicious curry puffs in Thomson area, thin and crispy crust with generous fillings of meat and egg.

Sue Asff,5,The mutton curry puff is the best imo. I love having prata next door then come here to get curry puffs. The price point is lower than ock and it is more homemade flavours. Nice packaging for a box of 10 and good to bring to gift. Very polite staff!,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118063503336419300601/reviews
Sharon Chua,5,nice curry puffs with thin flaky crust.  value for money as the fillings are quite substantial.  Love the strands of onions inside sardine puffs and the chunks of chicken meat in the chicken curry puffs.  Love that it is not oily.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106012988034437765019/reviews
