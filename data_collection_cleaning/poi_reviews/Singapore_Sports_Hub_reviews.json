Got outside and saw an amazingly beautiful view. Too bad I haven’t explored the rest tho, so it’s a 3 star first. But everything ended up great! There is also a running track, maybe any runners can run there. Have a nice day!",

      "text": "Inhumane and inefficient security and crowd control at Sports Hub\n\nI am expressing my deep concern and dissatisfaction with the security and crowd control measures implemented during concerts at the Sports Hub. The recent handling of pedestrian movement and accessibility has not only been highly inefficient but also questionable, inhumane, and outright impractical.\n\nOn 15 Feb 2025, Saturday evening, visitors faced severe inconveniences due to poorly designed and illogical pedestrian flow regulations. Specifically, traffic was permitted to walk from the 'bridge to Kallang MRT' (Level 3) to Kallang Wave Mall (Level 1) via a designated route (walking along the outer perimeter of the stadium to the OCBC Aquatic Center, through to Level 1, and eventually to Kallang Wave Mall), but inexplicably, the same route was not allowed for return access. At no point did the signage indicate that this was a one-way route, causing confusion and frustration (as evidenced in the attached photos).\n\nTo make matters worse, when we sought guidance from stadium security staff, we were advised to return to Kallang Wave Mall, take the lift to Level 3, exit near the entrance, and walk along the outer perimeter back to the 'bridge to Kallang MRT.' However, upon following these instructions, we encountered yet another blockage, leaving us with no feasible exit options except through Stadium MRT. This lack of foresight completely disregards the needs of shoppers and visitors who do not intend to use the MRT but need to return to the 'bridge to Kallang MRT.'\n\nAs a result of these nonsensical restrictions, we were effectively trapped for over an hour (from 6.30pm to 7.30pm), unable to leave Kallang Wave Mall. Ultimately, many, (imagine if it involves elderly individuals, pregnant women, and those with mobility issues) were forced to walk along Nicoll Highway in the rain—a longer and more hazardous route without shelter—just to exit the premises. Such measures are not only highly inconsiderate but also pose a direct risk to public safety.\n\nAdditionally, these unnecessary crowd control measures significantly deter the public from utilising the Sports Hub for its intended sporting purposes. Runners and fitness enthusiasts are being displaced from using the tracks during days of concerts, making one question whether this venue should be renamed a “Concert Hub” instead, as concerts appear to take priority over public sports activities. It is also worth noting that major sporting events rarely use the stadium, further diminishing its core purpose.\n\nIf the authorities’ preference is to cater exclusively to concertgoers, perhaps a formal advisory should be issued discouraging the general public from utilising the Sports Hub and Kallang Wave Mall during concert events. Otherwise, a serious reconsideration of the current policies must be undertaken to ensure that all visitors—whether concertgoers, shoppers, or sports enthusiasts—are given fair and reasonable access to the premises.",
