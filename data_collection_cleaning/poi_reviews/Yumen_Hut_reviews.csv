Teo Pearlyn,1,"The vegetables tasted bitter. Ordered fried fish mushroom noodle. I donâ€™t taste mushroom from the noodle.

The coffee and tea are instant type.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109966358346276591879/reviews
Jason Lim,3,"First time here, my wife was fascinated by the photos and different variety. After we ordered, she shared with me a mix of Google reviews - some good some bad with only 2.7* for over hundreds, some praising for it's economic pricing vs rest of other restaurants here in Downtown E!.

I have given a 3* because to be fair, the rating varies from individual to individual some prefers tasty or heavier seasoning while some prefers lighter.

Their seafood Yi mee - 6.5/10, with some  decent taste but prawn bit small
Otah - 8/10 must try
Spinach mee dumpling - 2/10, completely off expectation I think they should indicate seasoning or flavouring rating to manage patrons expectation
Curry chicken noodle - 5/10, spicy yet not enough curry flavor

I may return just for it's otah for Dabao let my parents try.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105077761621672750125/reviews
Yeung Jasmine,3,"I would say it is a relatively cheap option that can be found in Downtown East. There is a variety of noodles & soup bases to choose from. We chose Tom Yum + pumpkin noodles and Seafood soup + carrot noodles. However, the taste was really so so. Once is enough :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114611266380229526266/reviews
Hao Tan,3,A small noodle restaurant located within Downtown East. They are Halal certified. Theres a few noodles dishes on the Menu. Simple decoration. Clean and comfortable.  Prices were reasonable comparing with other foods shops around the area. Foods were average. Will try other restaurants rather than revisit.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117487638688399238932/reviews
