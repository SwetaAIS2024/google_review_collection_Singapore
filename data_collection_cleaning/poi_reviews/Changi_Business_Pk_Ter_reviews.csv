Javen Leow,5,"Very isolated bus terminal - there is nothing surrounding the bus terminal, except for the rear entrance into SUTD (and even then most students would rather enter via the side entrance at Upper Changi station).
Consequently, very few people use this tranquil terminal. There is space set aside for a canteen, but it looks like it has never opened.

Only two bus services call here - 47 and 118.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103533744765056843646/reviews

Francis Marzuq,5,"Son left accessory bag on bus 47, made online report to Lost and found to SBS. Email arrived before lunch that it cannot be found. Spouse made a trip personally to terminal since we can't get phone contact to terminal anywhere. We found bag almost immediately. Kudos to terminal customer service and bus captain.
