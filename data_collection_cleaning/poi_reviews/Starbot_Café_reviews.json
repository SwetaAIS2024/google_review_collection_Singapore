They gave some deep fried item in our veg meal, not sure,.what do they use to deep fry. It's expensive but food doesn't stand for the price. There was simple ask salt pepper and were not able to find in complete store and didn't see any interest from staff to locate.Staffs are rude, My experience was not great and least recommended place to go.",
