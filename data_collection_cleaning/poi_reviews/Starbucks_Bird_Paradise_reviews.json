      "text": "Located at Mandai Wildlife West Deck level 2. Next to Forest Stream Trail and facing Bird Paradise entrance, opposite Pavilion Banana Leaf restaurant and Membership Experience.\nEnter was well greeted by the manager(white long sleeve shirt) with a big smile. We found a table indoors around 7 tables and there's outdoor tables too.\nWe tried Matcha Soymilk Latte hot and ice version. The hot version is rich in Matcha and the ice version is good which my friend commented  as the weather is ðŸŒž.  As for the Matcha Burnt Cheesecake is good too strong Matcha taste. There's a small miscommunication between me and tge Cashier maybe my voice is soft so she can't hear me clearly, and she just charged me one Matcha Burnt Cheesecake so I thought I have 2 Cheesecake and the manager(sorry, never take note of his name), he is kind enough to serve us another piece of Matcha Cheesecake and told us can proceed to make payment after the long queue. Is very thoughtful of him of serving us the cheesecake first.",
