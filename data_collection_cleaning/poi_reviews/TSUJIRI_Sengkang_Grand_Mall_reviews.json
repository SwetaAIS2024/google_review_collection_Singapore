She claimed the matcha pudding with its Creme Brulee like topping was god tier, to me it's ok wouldn't come all the way to SK Grand just to have it though. Personally I had a refreshing sorbet to cleanse my palate, which was pretty average.",

Instead of making guests surprised with the final price, why not just say the price as it is on the menu? Seriously misleading. Expect rlly slow service, 20min for a cup of matcha. I understand that it is during peak hours, however, other matcha places have been able to keep up with the pace of orders",
