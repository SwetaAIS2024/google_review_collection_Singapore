Daphne Ng,5,"My mum of 76 years old experiences chronic lower right back pain for a week; there will be shooting pain periodically & her walking is also weaken.
I chance upon pain treatment home clnic under Levan, within one session of lymphatic & deep tissues massage, he is able to identify all her painpoint & weakness, that led her to much much better well being & even able to walk steadily with the chronic pain after one hour.
This is without injection or medication as stated in their website.
Trust that my mum will get better & better as she go through more treatments under Levan.

Nurah Kadar,5,"Before i do the treatment here im having severe knee pain and whole body aching and after doing the treatment, my knee pain reduced a lot and i can walk better and stand longer. Before that i visited the TCM which is so painful and my whole body turn blue black and became worst . Im very glad i engaged  Levan home services and he is very good and took care of me very well. I highly recommend anyone to try this treatment as the treatment is no pain at all. Last time i have very bad insomnia and can only sleep one hour. Now after the second treatment i can sleep soundly and througout the night. Thank you very much Levan for helping me.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105713564770363821188/reviews
Lim Larry,5,"Levan's physiotherapy has been a game-changer for me. His targeted treatment for my knee joints,  sciatica, shoulder, wrist, and finger pain provided significant relief. By the 5th session,  I was already feeling much better,  and after the 7th session,  I was nearly pain free, able to return to my normal activities like 5-8 km walks and my work routine. Initially skeptical,  I'm now now grateful I found Levan. His professionalism and expertise truly improved my quality of life. Thank you Levan.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105531661834182898446/reviews
