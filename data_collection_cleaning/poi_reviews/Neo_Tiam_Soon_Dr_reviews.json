      "text": "My ex company always send staff to Dr. Neo as they r siblings. Dr. Neo doesn't communicate wif me after medical check up,  instead he informed CEO & HR dept of my results. In conclusion, my CEO summons me back from overseas where I worked, to inform me that I may hv breast cancer due to lumps detected and gave me a letter signed off by HR Director to state that the company will not be liable to pay for such expenses. Dr. Neo & my ex CEO (Mr. Neo, his brother) are totally unprofessional, I don't see the necessity of a CEO to speak to me abt such issue abt my breasts/ health, very upset üòü & caused me unnecessary anxieties, the doctor shld be the one to talk to me, right?! I went for thorough check up at Cancer centre, and there's no lump, no cancer. Thank goodness!  üôè",

      "text": "We had our first injection for pneumonia in this clinic last year. The clinic said we can claim 100% through Medisave even for the 2nd one. So my wife and I decided to go ahead but now that we are back for 2nd injection, the clinic claimed that we have to pay first before they allow the 2nd one. The clinic reception people were acting rude when we try to explain that it should be the same as the first one where we can claim 100% based on what they assured us. They said they do not trust patients at all so they have to make us pay, instead of going through Medisave procedure. Warning! Do not trust this clinic!",
