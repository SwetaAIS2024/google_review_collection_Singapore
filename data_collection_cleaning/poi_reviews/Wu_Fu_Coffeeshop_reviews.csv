Pearl Tok,5,"The coffee shop is just nearby Tampines Polyclinic. Spacious, clean dining experience. The zhi char stall offer dine in $12 Thai style curry fish head, really worth eating. Big portion of fresh and the curry is appetising! Sometimes, when the fish head is finished, it will be replaced with fish meat, which cost $15.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103792607692879987274/reviews
Johanna Chow,4,"Decent coffeeshop in Tampines!

Always come for the Lor Mee and the Yi Xin noodle stall is pretty good too. Curry puff from the Malay stall is very nice, tried their mee soto and I give it a 7.5/10. Skip the roasted meat stall, char siew and roasted pork was so-so.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104436666547405320865/reviews
Jeremine Poh,5,"Surprisingly nice claypot rice in the neighbourhood after the renovation! We love the charred smell and taste, will be better if the 锅巴 is not charred to black (the chef needs to be more patient and control the fire well). The chicken is well marinated and tender. 1 claypot rice at $7 can feed a big eater or 2 adults.

Their soups are great too. We ordered lotus soup and ginseng chicken soup. My dad loves the meicai pork! Will be back for herbal chicken soon",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104765725791442449178/reviews
Kelvin Poh,1,"Despite previous reports and clear 'No Smoking' signs, people continue to smoke within the coffee shop premises.

Throughout my dinner with my family, I could smell cigarette smoke, which is particularly concerning since my kids were inhaling secondhand smoke. Smoke travels easily, and I believe stricter enforcement is necessary to prevent this.

From my observation, the two individuals smoking appeared to be aware of their actions and were constantly looking around, likely to avoid detection.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103496137315601811482/reviews
Alan Lye,1,"Upon getting our orders of 2 bowls of lor mee, I requested for garlic and chili paste as there were little left. However I was rudely refused by the stall keeper “You don’t know how to eat lor mee is it? Where got people add garlic one?!”

So I nodded, took my orders and left the stall. Will never visit again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112970661107136812220/reviews
