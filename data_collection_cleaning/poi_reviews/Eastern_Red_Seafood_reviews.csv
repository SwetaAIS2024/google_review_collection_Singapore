Elijah Tan,5,"We embarked on a night cycling journey to east coast and were fortunate to stumble upon a stall that happened to be selling an exquisite array of seafood.

The auntie serving us was super smiley and friendly. Glad to have visited her stall.

We simply enjoyed their stingray and bbq garlic butter prawns. One of the better ones we have tried.

Not really a fan of the garlic lala. The sauce that it was cooked in was a bit too thick for our liking.

Highly-recommended!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109287346354369266778/reviews
