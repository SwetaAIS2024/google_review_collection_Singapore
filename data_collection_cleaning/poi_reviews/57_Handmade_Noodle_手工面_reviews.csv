Delson Tan,2,"Came to this coffeeshop looking for the long lost pork chop noodles but it has since been replaced by another stall. Saw some Google reviews recommending this stall and decided to try. Portions and taste was average. However hygiene is terrible. Before starting the meal, my mom commented the spoon was dirty and changed another one. Towards the end of my meal, notice ld a long strain of hair stuck to the side of the bowl. Immediately got turned off and stopped eating. Hope nothing happens to me.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104060112806128287329/reviews

R≈´kasu,4,"This is not my first visit. Then I realised there was no listing on Google map, so I added one.

One of the best ‚Äúdry‚Äù mee hoon kway I have tried.

Usually mee hoon kway are soup base. If you have not tried dry type, do give them a shot.

At $3.50 per plate the ingredient are simple yet tasty. A good mixture of vege, minced meat and ikan bilis together with their recipe of vinegar makes this an appetising dish.

My only wish is that they can have option to replace the meatballs to fishballs.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117694150673352299197/reviews
