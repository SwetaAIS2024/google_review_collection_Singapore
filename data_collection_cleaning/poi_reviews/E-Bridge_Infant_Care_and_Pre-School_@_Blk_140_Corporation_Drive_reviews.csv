Jenn,3,"facilities are good, Teachers are patient and kind.
The only thing parents need to know before enrolment is that childâ€™s first day, we are not allowed to stay in with them like any other preschool, which is not very good esp they are trying to adapt to new environment and new people. School updates are also very minimum",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115141096687934438717/reviews
Sophia Yeo,5,"Posting this on our kids' last day here, and wishing we could bring the entire school with us.

Ever since walking past the preschool and deciding to enroll the kids here because we felt good vibes, then enrolling and being really thankful we chose right, and hearing great feedback from grandparents, we had every intention to keep the kids here until they had to attend primary school.

Unfortunately, plans changed and we had to move. And initially we were (to be frank) a little worried that the kids would not get the same support. But instead, their teachers actively supported us, even to the point of looking for books that covered topics about moving and attending new schools.

Never thought I would be so sad about having to leave a preschool, but we are. This is an incredible school with a selection of highly motivated, patient educators who are genuinely invested in the children.

A huge thank you again to their teachers:
Gao Laoshi & Ms Nasha, Mr Evan, Ms Xinyi and Xin Xin Laoshi - thank you for being the reason Maya loves school and gets grumpy if we pick her up too early.
Ivy Laoshi, Ms Afiah, Ee Laoshi, Ms Nadya and Ms Yin-ning - the simple fact that Kai our COVID baby who cried so badly at first and blossomed into someone who runs right in and is now so well adjusted is testament to the incredible support offered to him.
Special mention to Ms Chloe and Ms Syuhaidah as well, and everyone else who've supported their journey here. Your dedication has not gone unnoticed.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107236963755846187636/reviews
Josephine N.,5,Enrolled my son to IFC this year. Positive experience so far. Teachers are nice and activities planned are good for the infants development. I like the fact that the infant bay is separated in another building (good to have during covid period),3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105486183636473039942/reviews
Bryan T. (Duke of Admiralty),5,"One of the latest facility by Eton Bridge located within Yung Ho Spring I, Taman Jurong. From the looks of the learning and activity space it has, I would say it is ready to take alot of applications. Has a full size kitchen even to cater for kids meals during the day. Overall positive impression of the place, but suggest parents to visit during the day for a closer look and ""test the water"" with your child before deciding.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101230268358111404101/reviews
