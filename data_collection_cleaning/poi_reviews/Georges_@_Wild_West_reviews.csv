Chris Koh,5,This restaurant is really located in the wild west. The place is very ulu and quite difficult to get to unless you drive. Parking is free as there is no designated parking lots. The meat were all tender and juicy. Specially love the roasted pork belly. There is outdoor seating so pets are welcomed,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110140186706826086199/reviews
Melvin J.,5,"Had dinner at Georges @ Wild West, a chill spot with good food and casual vibes. Ordered the Half BBQ Baby Pork Ribs ($26.90) and Beer Battered Dory & Chips ($17.90).

The ribs were tender, slow-cooked for four hours, according to the staff. You can really taste the effort. The dory was nicely battered and crispy, and the fries were crispy, just how I like them.

A nice touch, their salad greens are sourced from a local farm, which supports the community and adds a freshness you can taste. Itâ€™s these small details that make the meal feel more thoughtful.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110204106470894976302/reviews
Wendy Yong,3,"Place is easy to drive to. Ample free parking. As I brought my furkid so we sat outside. Most diners were seated inside. We reached about 7plus for dinner, exterior is all dark. Nothing much to see.
Ordered steak, carbonara, impossible burger, chicken chop etc. Portion is small. Taste wise average. Food took a while to serve. For 6pax, we spent about $270+.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105929998922661059677/reviews

Ryan Tan,2,"Not accessible by public transport, it is a rather quiet and peaceful area to dine in. Food quality was below average, ordered a salmon fish, and was overcooked. The milkshake served was way far off from what was shown in the menu. Can't get our refund and were given the excuses that the image was taken during the early development phase. We had no choice but to accept, tasted like vanilla milkshake with slight hint of salted caramel. Definitely not recommending anyone to visit for their food at this price point.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115840213604703705318/reviews
