      "text": "Excellent Service and Professionalism!\n\nThis is my second time patronizing L S Tyres & Automotive, and I have nothing but good words for their service.\n\nI was informed by my car servicing technician that my tyre needed replacement due to wear and an unrepairable puncture. After finding a suitable set of tyres from L S Tyres, I made a call, and within 10 minutes, we had arranged for me to head down to their workshop.\n\nUpon arrival, I witnessed a team of highly skilled technicians working swiftly and professionally to replace my tyres. Their efficiency, expertise, and attention to detail were truly commendable. The entire process was smooth, and I left feeling assured that my car was in good hands.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for quality tyre services with top-notch customer care!",

      "text": "Visited to replace my worn car tires to Michelin Primacy 4ST. Straight forward deal and price was reasonable. They also advised me on getting wheel alignment done, and pointed out my worn brake pads and wheel nuts (all legit need) which i gladly replaced. They were also very kind to help me remove my worn suspension stopper at my request. Tires done nicely and helped to clean the rims and shine the tires (will add a photo soon). Lady boss was still very active and hands-on, coming over multiple times to check the work and it was a joy chatting with her. Happy to see her still strong and agile.",
