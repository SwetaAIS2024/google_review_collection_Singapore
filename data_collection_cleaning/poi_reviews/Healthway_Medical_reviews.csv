Fernling,5,"I had a great experience at Healthway Medical. The nurse on duty was super attentive, demonstrating genuine care and professionalism throughout my visit. They always provide reassurance and make me feel comfortable made a world of difference.
The doctor was also very remarkable, showing immense patience and taking the time to listen carefully to all my concerns. They explained everything clearly and made sure I felt comfortable and well-informed at every step of my care.

linda demello,5,"Both Dr Gong and Dr Loong are professional and caring GPs. They are supported by an equally considerate and friendly team led by Stella. My husband and I have been cared for by them for more than 10years. As a first point of contact for medical issues, they are widely and deeply knowledgeable. Waiting times can be a little long as the GPs take time to treat each person, you are not a number at this clinic. You are a cared for patient.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108884599219863287590/reviews
