a e,5,This place is amazingly unique in Singapore. It’s like the one stop shop for all the local brands and the space keeps changing I went there during before Singapore Design week on the week itself and the next week it’s different. The brand prices are actually pretty reasonable it’s mainly female oriented it seems but there’s some brands that are for guys and kids . A lot of different Jewelry brands and fashion that are so local I’ve not hear about and have not seen them in any of the regular malls where international brands are common.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117960194292242399104/reviews

Coco O,5,"Lovely shop with Singapore brands and Singapore design. Not tacky souvenirs, but cool local designs and well known local designers.
There's beautiful gifts here that would work as farewell gifts just as much as for everyday use at home. Beautiful clothes and jewelry as well",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101461615639083957237/reviews
Skye Cai,5,"Cute place with more than 100 Singapore local designers stores in.
The outlook itself is also fashionable and the whole place smells very good.
Not much crowd and when walking in, a store give perfume sample to smell.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Paul Estuar,5,"Wonderful collection of clothes, small home goods, and other items from local independent designers. The layout is like a market with individual displays from each designer. I found it interesting to have a printed biography about the designer in each stall, so I can learn something about their background and their design philosophy. The staff are friendly and helpful. The single-floor space is a nice contrast to the mega brand malls that line Orchard Road. Come here and support local makers, and go home with a true original from Singapore.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106778668737983232529/reviews
