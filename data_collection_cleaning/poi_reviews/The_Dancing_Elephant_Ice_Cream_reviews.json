The price is ++ but definitely I will come back again and again. Thanks for the good effort in coming out the yummy ice cream. My next try is the brendy chocolate.",

      "text": "Just as other reviewers have said, the speculoos and salt flavor ice cream is so special! I also really enjoy their homemade biscuits/cookies. They are so buttery and tasty. Don’t be surprised if they are sometimes sold out. There are nut-free brownies for customers who are nut-averse. I return because I know a portion of the proceeds goes towards a rescue elephant in India.",

Saw a hole in the kaya ice cream scoop and felt the portion could have been more and flavour stronger too. Mocha fudge was nice. There are tables outside the stall to sit and drawing paper and pens for kids to scribble.",

Melts fast so make sure you finish it!\n\nThai mango ice cream was also great! Had many mango ice creams but Thai mango ice cream was pleasantly different. Something different and uncommon so try it.\n\nIG @iambruisedlee",

Cashier also seemed abit stern and lukewarm albeit well mannered if that makes sense.\n\nPrices for single scoop from $4 onwards; dark chocolate wasn’t aromatic and lacked the bitter after taste while their signature salted speculoos was alright but overly sweet, best to be shared.",
