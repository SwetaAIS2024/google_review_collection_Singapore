Nelson Lim,5,"Refer to receipt for what I ordered. Overall, I’ll say that all the dishes are nice. The meehoon has wok hei, chicken is juicy inside and crispy outside and the veg was very aromatic from the fried garlic.

Coffee shop environment, nothing to shout about.

Gave my kids candy so, 5 stars for their service. It’s a little things that go a long way.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117926345924996702573/reviews
Joanne Cheng,5,"The eatery is located in the coffeeshop in the industrial area. It is spacious and has parking lots. And not difficult to find parking space. Suitable for big families to visit for dinner gatherings.
Food portion is pretty generous and always enough for the family, the kids love to order cereal prawn ball, pig trotter mee hoon and curry fish. The fish head steamboat is also another yummy dish we ordered often. ☺️
At times, I also do mobile to order and can pick up easily.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110408957347137900620/reviews
Jun Kai,2,"Tried the Mongolian meat rice, and honestly, the meat just didn’t feel right. It had this powdery texture that made it seem like it wasn’t real, whole meat  - more like low quality meat with fillers. I get that hawker stalls have to work with tight budgets, but I’d honestly rather get a smaller portion of real meat than whatever this was. Real meat has more protein. And whenever I order meat dishes, I am actively trying to get more protein. I don't like feeling shortchanged for what I (or anyone) reasonably perceive it meal to be. When they see meat rice - common consensus is it to contain real meat.

It just felt like a letdown, especially when other zhi char places use proper meat. Left feeling ripped off, and I definitely wouldn’t order this again. Don't think I would be coming back here again. The last time (before this incident) when I wanted to order - the person also kept ignoring me when I tried to get their attention. Though this time, their service is better, but the meat I got was a letdown.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116988250543618787949/reviews
