      "text": "Extremely bad experience at one of the wards here. Something happened tonight that made me fuming mad. My elderly mum is currently warded at this hospital.\n\nShe has high fall risk and is wearing adult diapers. At 7.45pm, she wanted to go to the toilet as her diaper is already very wet.\n\nI consulted the nurse on duty, and she reassured me that the nurses who are taking over at 8pm would shower my mum once they take over.\n\nSo, I asked my mum to wait a bit. 8pm came, and I asked the nurse again. She said they needed more time for the hand-over to the night nurses.\n\nIn the end, at 8.15pm, my mum could not take it any longer, and I told her to use the adult diaper she‚Äôs wearing.\n\nAt every 15 min interval, I would ask the night nurses when they would shower my mum. They kept on giving fluffy reasons to brush me off.\n\nI observed that they were happily chatting away while working on their computers. They even asked me to leave. But, I told them I would not leave until they shower my mum.\n\nFinally, after 1 hour 15 min, at the very LATE timing of 9.15pm, they then decided it‚Äôs time to shower my elderly mum.\n\nI do not wish to write this review. I am a patient person & I have a lot of respect for the medical & nursing profession.\n\nBut, the flippant way they handled the situation and not being empathetic to an old lady‚Äôs needs is really unacceptable.\n\nAfter the shower, my mum started sneezing non-stop. That‚Äôs because the nurse did not bother to use a towel to wipe her hair dry!!! üò° üò° üò° I had to quickly use the thick serviettes to dry her hair.\n\nSeeing me doing this, the night nurse finally bothered to bring a towel for my mum, and I personally dried my mum‚Äôs hair.\n\nI hope CGH would seriously review this grave lapse in service & care incident.\n\nDate: 16.8.2023\nVenue: The Integrated Building CGH",

      "text": "3 family members n I went to visit my sister in Ward 57 on 19 Jan n the gantry system was very bad n disappointing. I understand that only 2 visitors are allowed at a time but we were told there‚Äôs 1 visitor up there so after checking for quite a while, only 1 person was allowed to go up. After finding out only 1 person was upstair, I clarified with the staff n was told he had to do a bypass to let another person in. Each time when anyone wanted to go up they had to do bypass again. That has taken a lot of our time just to visit. I wonder what will happen if there‚Äôs an emergency for us to go up n who is going to be responsible for all these problems. The gantry problem has to be addressed urgently.",

The only thing is that cardiac clinic has  beverage vending machine not selling HOT DRINKS like ‚òï or üî• üç´ , üçµ which is ashamed as the air conditioning temperature is quite cold.
