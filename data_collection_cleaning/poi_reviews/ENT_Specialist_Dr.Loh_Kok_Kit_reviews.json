He always makes a point to be as clear as possible during consultation while at the same time, being mindful of his patientsâ€™ anxiety of their conditions. Thank you very much!",

Better to spend the $12K one day op and hospital stay somewhere else. Didnt need to take parental advice from you just because your children are doctors and to be told that my son is being manipulative.",
