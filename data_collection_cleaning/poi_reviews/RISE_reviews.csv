Daxter Yeo,5,"BEST Breakfast Buffet Ever – RISE at Marina Bay Sands!

If you’re in Singapore, you MUST experience breakfast at RISE — it’s out of this world! From the moment I stepped in, the bright, luxurious setting set the tone for an unforgettable morning.

The spread was jaw-dropping: fresh laksa made to order, fragrant nasi lemak with crispy chicken, fluffy prata with rich curry, comforting congee with classic toppings, and the most perfect kaya toast I’ve ever had.
There were also butter chicken, wanton noodles, and endless Western classics like fluffy omelettes, bacon, sausages, and hash browns.

The bakery station was heaven — buttery croissants, danishes, muffins — all freshly baked.
For something lighter, there was a beautiful spread of mango, rambutan, papaya, and a rainbow of fresh juices.
The yoghurt bar was another highlight — thick, creamy, and delicious!

The service was five-star: warm, efficient, and genuine. Plates were cleared instantly and coffee topped up with a smile.

This isn’t just a meal — it’s a celebration of Singapore’s multicultural flavors in a single, incredible sitting.

RISE absolutely blew me away — I’m already planning my return!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112676269452896865057/reviews
Lhacuze,5,"Our recent anniversary dinner at Rise Restaurant was nothing short of exceptional, largely thanks to the outstanding service provided by our server, MJ.  From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the wide variety and quality of the global buffet. The Thai dishes, specifically the fragrant green curry and perfectly balanced thai noodles and sticky mango were highlights, showcasing authentic flavors and meticulous preparation.

While the restaurant's ambiance was impeccably clean and relaxing, it was MJ's exceptional attentiveness that truly elevated the evening.  He anticipated our needs with uncanny accuracy, ensuring our champagne glasses were never empty and our plates cleared promptly without interrupting our conversation. His positive energy was amazing, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere around our table.  Beyond his professionalism, MJ possessed a remarkable ability to connect with us on a personal level.

The entire experience was seamless and enjoyable, from the initial greeting (though somewhat brief) to the final farewell.  While other staff members, like Nina, also provided excellent service, MJ's performance was exceptionally memorable.  The combination of exquisite food, impeccable ambiance, and MJ's unparalleled service made our dinner at Rise Restaurant one of the best buffet experiences we've ever had.  We wholeheartedly recommend Rise, and we'll certainly be returning, hoping to be served by MJ again.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107409553505153366940/reviews
Christopher U,5,"We had an opportunity to stay a night @ Marina Bay Sands and I made sure not no missed the Rise Breakfast Buffet.
If you are a foodie like us; I think it's a must to experience different selection of great dishes. I know prices is on the higher side but its totally worth it. If we had a chance to stay two nights, for sure we had back to back breakfast at the Rise Restaurant. Too many stations that is hard to pass up not trying some dishes.
Great food selection and outstanding service. Strongly recommended!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112456220555772504593/reviews
Jason Tan,5,"I’ve dined at RISE at Marina Bay Sands many times, but my most recent visit today was truly unforgettable, all thanks to the exceptional service provided by Chef Bon, the receptionist Donaya, and Thong.

As my daughter don’t eat beef or lamb, her food options at the buffet were quite limited that evening. I wasn’t expecting much could be done, but to my surprise, the staff went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. The receptionist warmly listened to her dietary needs and took the initiative to check with the kitchen. She made us feel seen and cared for right from the start.

Chef Bon, despite how busy the kitchen must have been, took the time and effort to prepare something special for us. His kindness and attention to detail truly touched me.

It’s rare to encounter such sincere hospitality and genuine warmth, especially in a busy restaurant setting. All three of them turned what could have been a quiet, restricted dinner into a deeply heartwarming experience. Their thoughtfulness and team spirit reflect the very best of what great service should be.

The food at RISE is always of great quality, but it’s the people who make the real difference. Huge thanks once again to Chef Bon, the Thai receptionist, and Thong. We will definitely be back again, and will wholeheartedly recommend RISE to everyone.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110150854777862739577/reviews
SJMG15 S,5,"The breakfast here is truly outstanding! There’s a huge variety of choices to satisfy every palate, from healthy options to hot and cold dishes, plus an impressive selection of cuisines including Indian, Japanese, and more. Everything is fresh and flavorful, making it a delightful way to start the day. The atmosphere of the place is equally amazing, adding to the overall experience. While I do find it a bit on the pricey side, I’d say it’s definitely worth trying at least once for the quality and variety it offers. Highly recommended!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108307970715161243833/reviews
