      "text": "Cozy izakaya place which I hear many Japanese visiting. walk in has a dining limit of about 90 mins, more than enough time. The most memorable dish was beef tongue soup, the broth was sweet with its fat and the tongue was so tender that you could \"laji\" with them. Sorry for the language, trying to be funny. Its chicken meatballs were just ma-ma so-so. Along with its grilled stick dishes, a little drier in meat. 5 kinds sashimi was good though, not too cold and the best cut was its salmon, it was so thick and succulent, wooden chopsticks can't hold it properly.. ðŸ˜†\n\nOverall, a chill place you should try.",

Most dishes here are very well made with great authentic flavour.\n\nTried the daily lunch special oyakodon today. Itâ€™s alright but could use a little more salty flavour.\n\nYou gotta book to guarantee a seat here. Walk in is possible but no guarantee. You can try to ask if have walk in seat. If no seat you can go to the isle cafe nearby.",

We were pleasantly surprised when we were served hot towels after being seated. The food cost around $23 after adding the rice set to complete the meal. Most of the dishes were okay to good, except for the Tsukune. Overall, we enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere.",
