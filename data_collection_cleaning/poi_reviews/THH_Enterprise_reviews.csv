IVAN Gan Property Consultant,1,"I went to this store to buy a phone card, and then asked me to register his passport. I gave him the passport, and he didn’t know where to put it. Then he scanned the phone card there. The phone card couldn’t be scanned. It took more than ten minutes to get it, but it was finally done. , and then lost my passport, and kept saying that I didn’t give him my passport. Even though my friend and I watched him take my passport with our own eyes, he kept saying that I didn’t give it to him, and let him watch the CCTV, saying that the CCTV was broken. , but in the end he was stuffed in a corner by himself!

I am very angry. This boss is just confused and very irresponsible. He lost the customer's passport and kept saying that the customer did not give him a passport and he should not be responsible! Fortunately, I found my passport in the end. If I lost it, how would I go back to my country? Today’s trip would be ruined. I have to find a way to solve the problem of losing my passport!

Although the passport was found in the end, it took more than thirty minutes of my time. I thought that this problem was late for the rest of my trip. It was obvious that I could solve the problem in a few minutes by going to another phone store to buy a phone card, but I spent thirty minutes here. many minutes

I'm really angry, this store is so confused and irresponsible! I'll never come here again,",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104534431231931514601/reviews
