Wisanu Tuntawiroon,5,"Telok Ayer Green is a charming urban oasis tucked away in the heart of Singapore’s bustling downtown. Despite its modest size, this small park offers a welcoming retreat where nature and design come together to provide a peaceful escape from city life.

The park’s thoughtfully designed landscape features gentle greenery, neatly landscaped lawns, and a scattering of mature trees that offer welcome shade on sunny days. Subtle pathways invite leisurely strolls, while carefully placed seating areas encourage visitors to pause, relax, and savor the tranquility that contrasts nicely with the energetic urban surroundings.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109243125213682583986/reviews
Aman Kozha,5,"A hidden gem in the heart of Chinatown! Telok Ayer Green Park is a beautifully maintained little oasis that offers a peaceful break from the hustle and bustle of the city. What stands out are the charming bronze sculptures scattered throughout the park – like the one in the photo I took – depicting scenes from Singapore’s rich multicultural past. It feels like stepping back in time, and it’s a great spot to learn a little history while enjoying the greenery.

The pathways are clean and well-paved, and there is plenty of shade from the trees, making it perfect for a relaxing stroll. It’s also conveniently located near historical landmarks like Thian Hock Keng Temple and various heritage buildings. If you’re exploring Chinatown or love quiet spots with character, it is a must-visit.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114220481994962867432/reviews
M M,5,"A beautiful little green park near China Town in Singapore.
Its an historic park, and an oasis in the middle of the city.
Only small, it has the historical statues, temple, and fascinatingly, marks the area where the original shoreline of Singapore island was. A 'boat' is on the side, and fishermen work there. It's hard to imagine, but a wonderful look into the past.

Highly recommend a walk around this small park, maybe sit down with a drink for 5 minutes and enjoy the atmosphere",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114442474015223259254/reviews
