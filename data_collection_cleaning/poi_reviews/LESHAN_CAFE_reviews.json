Some parts hard hard one.. for that imma have to give it a 2.9/5..\nthe laksa was good and flavourful 3.8/5\n\nOverall price was on steeper end. Like $32 for both dishes in total.\n\nLocated in temple so itâ€™s quite a cool place.\n\nWould I come back? Probably not on my own choice. But I guess itâ€™s a cool place for foreigners who are coming to Singapore for the first time! ðŸ™‚",

Seats in blue school style building are air conditioned, if you're afraid of the cold or resistant to the warm climate, you may choose seats at the corridor for a tea break for two, or take a seat in the pagoda at the centre.",
