Daniel Chew,1,"Extremely dismal!! Went to claim food from sentosa fun tokens but I wouldn't go back again even if I were paid to do so.

Zero stars, if possible.

Firstly most food were not available except for spring roll/french fries and wedges.

French fries -- rock hard and dry as a stone. Crumbles to dust on breaking. Not an exaggeration to say when dropped by piece they made the same sound on the table as my coffee cup

Spring rolls -- dry and extremely unpalatable. Uncooked to the extent there was so much flour residue visible just on looking into the packet

Wedges -- probably the only edible food out of the bunch, but this is hardly a compliment. The cook on it was so poor, there were some overcooked wedges and some undercooked with a prominent earthy taste

Ice cream - be warned. You will get a cup of magnolia neapolitan ice cream not unlike those sold at mum and pop shops, but for 3x the price.

This is an utter waste of food because they are hardly edible! Truthfully it takes more effort to screw up these food which is easily prepared in a fryer, than it is to do a decent job.

Thankful I didn't pay for the food, however given this is in a prominent tourist attraction, this is ghastly and not acceptable. Even if it were in a kopitiam, I would stay clear with a ten foot pole.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112390050874387632017/reviews
"Rating Food, Quality and Service",1,"The waiter serving us seem like he’s drinking on the job (had a canned of Tiger Beer behind the counter). Wasn’t able to catch what was told to him many times.

We ordered drumlets, orange juice, ice cream and cola.
- Drumlets taste as though it has been fried a long time ago and stored in a warmer.
- Orange juice basically taste like super diluted orange syrup water.
- Ice cream and Cola were the only ones we were able to consume entirely as they are confectionaries.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116389295299896318172/reviews
八田與一,1,"This is a very bad store.  When I ordered pizza and chicken, I was served something cooked in the microwave.  The pizza was also quite small and cost $20 too much.  I definitely recommend that you don't go there.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104344749532407185892/reviews
Jatin,1,Purchased ifly ticket for 119$ for my daughter today.  Asked a bit of sugar for my mother as she was feeling weak little bit. Very Rudely a lady at counter shouted that we don't give sugar free of cost.  I asked her to charge for it and gave $2 very softly.  Better avoid such arrogant staff hotel and bar. First they should learn the hospitality for such work.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113764866870016050060/reviews
