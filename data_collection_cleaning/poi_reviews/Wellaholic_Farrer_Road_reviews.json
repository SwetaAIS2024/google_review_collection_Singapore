      "text": "I started on a one year package for a monthly SHR removal session. Yesterday was my last session and I decided to leave a review.\n\nWhen I first started this session, I felt like the sessions were alright and after Iâ€™ve finished a little over half of my packageâ€™s sessions, I felt like the results werenâ€™t outstanding. Each session, there will be a new different therapist in charge, so the service was not consistent. I felt like there wasnâ€™t much results. This went on until I met Joan (I hope I remembered her name correctly)!\n\nDuring the very first time I had my very first session with her, I could feel like she was different and she made me feel very comfortable. She was very attentive and targeted tricky areas with precision which I really appreciate. After our first session together, I decided to request to have her as my therapist for the rest of my sessions.\n\nAfter my first two sessions with her, my hair growth slowed down significantly. From then onwards, the hair growth doesnâ€™t grow as much. The hair texture has also become finer and no longer as thick as before.\n\nI am very pleased with my results now. I wish I had met her earlier. Next time when I decide to start on a new package again, Iâ€™ll definitely request for her again. ðŸ¤—",

It was just a tiny suction device, which you can get off the internet at $68-$100.\n\nI also felt that my â€˜therapistâ€™ was not well trained. She missed certain spots on my face and was extremely rough.\n\nThe machine was tugging at my skin so hard and it did not feel good for the skin at all because my skin was being pulled so hard with every stroke and in all directions.\n\nIâ€™m left with what looks like blood spots/ skin hemorrhages on my face and on my forehead especially.",

Joan was very friendly, professional and made me feel completely at ease during my first session when I didnâ€™t know what to expect. There was also zero hard-sell involved here so I didnâ€™t feel pressured at all to purchase a package and only did so after I was sure that I would return. Would definitely recommend!",
