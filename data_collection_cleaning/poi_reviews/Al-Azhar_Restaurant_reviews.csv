Philip Moorthy,2,Have not dine here for sometime. Had supper just past midnite & I feel the quality is not as it was before . The prata tasted average The fish & chicken curry was too diluted & salty.  Hardly touched these curries.  Ordered the Prata set with mutton masala but ran out & replaced with mutton keema I believe which was fairly good compared to the salty currys. The salted Lassi drink was nice.  I think some quality control need to be done for the curry's.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110078323348651953102/reviews
ZN H (Food Traveller),3,Good place for group dinner after school. Usual hangout area during school days. Briyani is good. Tendoori seems not freshly prepared. Portion is generous.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114429224025835058076/reviews
Kevin (AussieFoodieAdventures),3,"The Tandoori Chicken tasted like it had been pre-cooked and reheated. It was tasty, a little dry and for $14 was definitely NOT value for money. The garlic naan at $3.50 was crispy on the outside with a soft chewy center. There was a good amount of garlic.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107203837341723663240/reviews
Mark Tan,4,"I’ve visited this place for supper several times, and it never disappoints. Open until very late, it’s the perfect spot to satisfy your cravings after a night out. While it’s popular for its Indian cuisine, especially the roti prata, the North Indian naan stands out—perfectly paired with their wide selection of flavorful gravies. The dining area is spacious, brightly lit, and impeccably clean, creating a comfortable environment to enjoy your meal. Prices are reasonable, and the convenience of ordering through a QR code and paying with credit cards adds to the overall experience.

Highly recommended for anyone seeking a late-night prata fix!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111684394902487136193/reviews
HL,5,Been coming to this place for almost 20 years. It holds great memories for me and the menu has steadily increased over the years. Food is not super awesome but I would say it's above average. And the sheer variety means there's definitely something for everyone.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116566863615297115336/reviews
