      "text": "Really nice rooftop bar with a comfortable cosy feel. Food is good, and I enjoyed the tapas very much. Some of them the portions were very tiny tho... for example the chorizo. Not consistent. The staff and waitresses were all very pleasant, attentive and polite. It's a lovely place to hang out for the evening. However I felt the live band was quite loud (and not very good, unfortunately) and it was challenging to have a conversation. I definitely appreciated the lengths of golden silence in between.... and the washrooms are one floor below haha so you need to take a lift down, or take the stairs.",

We had to request for a refund of tiramisu.  Duh....\n\nRestaurant wanted to make up BUT with invalid email?",
