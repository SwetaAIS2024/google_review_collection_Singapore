The steamed egg with pork was delish, and custardy in texture.  The pork patty did not taste overly fresh, or it could have been the fermented vegetables that was chopped and added inside.  The chicken was okay.  You have a choice of white or brown rice, as well as sides like cabbage with oyster sauce and salted vegetables, or braised peanuts.",
