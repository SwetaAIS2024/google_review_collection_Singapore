James Woo,5,"Some good stuff here! The fragrant coconut rice along with all the sharing dishes = superb combination. Flavourful, colorful, and stomachs very full! Wish they had a durian version of the signature chendol! Staff are all friendly! Will be back!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107468626183099479953/reviews
Jason C,4,"The food was pretty good, but not as good as the beach road location in my experience. The best thing about the place was the Aunty who brought us drinks and took care of us all dinner.

The sour sop drink was refreshing. We had fried chicken and the rundown both were good and recommend going with someone else so you can try both.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108860324597665559199/reviews
Jacob TAN,4,"Came here on Christmas and it was quite empty probably due to the difficulty to get parking. The nasi lemak and the ikan bilis and peanuts were nice. The meat dishes, rendang beef and fried chicken were very good. The sayur lodeh was not to my taste. The laksa had heavy dried shrimp taste. The chendol was OK but it was too expensive. The kueh salat was quite disappointing. The green portion was hard and not lemak.
Service was good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
EMOLUTION SG,4,"Everything is on point.
Rice is not as fragrant as compared to Dickson Nasi lemak.
Chicken is ideal n done well with a unique spice touch.
Sambal would prefer dickson
Cucumber is bit meh typical japanese cucumber.
Anchovies r average
Pricey compared but u pay for ambience. for full dining experience
Would still go Dickson Nasi lemak for convenience n price point.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100988133411703431405/reviews
Andrew Tan,5,"I have been a regular visitor of The Coconut Club since day one those days. My first time visiting the Siglap branch, and I must say it is still a great experience despite being a place where it is hard to find parking.

The service crew was very attentive and courteous. The environment is clean and welcoming despite being located in a small outlet.

Food is good as always, despite a change of ownership. I'm pleasantly surprised that kids under five dine for free with the rice & egg set.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100064065631123526331/reviews
