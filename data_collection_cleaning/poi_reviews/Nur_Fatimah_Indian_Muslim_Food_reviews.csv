D Y,5,"THE CURRY AND CHICKEN MURTABAK WAS DAMN GOOD. Prata also was very yums.
Serious. The indian cuisine stall here changed i think a year ago? (or so)
Went to try cause i saw someone said the murtabak, curry and prata is good.  TY TO THAT PERSON DOWN BELOW IN THE EARLIER REVIEW.

Wa really the curry damn yums when i ate with the murtabak. Its super nice.

Hope more people discover this place cause when i went at 6 it was empty,
(but ok la, after i ordered suddenly i think the dinner crowd like 5-6 people pop up behind me immediately).

HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104972702818836136510/reviews
