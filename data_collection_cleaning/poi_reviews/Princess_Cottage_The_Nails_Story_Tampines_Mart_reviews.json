Good products that are not harmful to nails, huge variety of polish colours. Good Quality of manicures/pedicures, in my 8years here, ever once had a manicure last close to 8 weeks before chipping. Otherwise, 3-4weeks not a problem. Responsible artists, ever had a case where the nail design chipped in 2days, was able to get it redone at no extra cost.",

She suggested colors for me to use to match the pictures as well. Whole session was really smooth and comfortable! The nail technicians are all very welcoming and patient when I explain what I want for my nails. Thank you so much! :)",
