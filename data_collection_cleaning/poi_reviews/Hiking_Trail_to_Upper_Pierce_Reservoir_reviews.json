      "text": "Trail Update (as of 1 May 2025):\nThe gate connecting MacRitchie to Upper Peirce Reservoir is open and accessible via the trail from Venus Drive Carpark. The route passes through the grounds of the Singapore Island Country Club and leads to a quiet view of the reservoir. While the detour is peaceful, the fencing along the country club feels out of place in the otherwise natural setting. Upper Peirce itself is a small, quiet park with not much to explore",
