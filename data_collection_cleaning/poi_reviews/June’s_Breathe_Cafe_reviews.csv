lontongstroong,4,"One pretty quaint lunch spot away from the more well-trafficked places in NTU campus, owned by a cheery middle aged couple. It's located in a concourse of the Experimental Medicine Building (third floor), accessible from the main North Spine complex from an overhead bridge.

Price is a bit more steep than in the cafeterias and they focus more on quality rather than portion size - perfect for dieting staffs and students. The menu is large - from pastries, sandwiches, cakes, wraps, cut fruits, coffee, and most importantly rice/pasta bowl with customizable topping (choices of meat, tofu, vegs). The pastries are served warm and fresh, and the bowl dishes' toppings are tasty. The coffee (espresso-based) is surprisingly pretty good and rather well-priced.

Can confirm sometimes there aren't enough seating during peak lunch time, albeit being situated inside a spacious concourse. More seating could be added so the customers can unwind.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
Cassia A,4,"It‚Äôs good and they‚Äôre realllyyy nice. But it‚Äôs expensive and the portion isn‚Äôt very big. $6.50 for a bowl (with chicken or tofu) and 3 toppings. They have brown rice which I really liked! But it‚Äôs not too much food.
They have lots of desserts like cake and banana bread.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117662481746295955146/reviews
Divyanshu Mahajan,4,"Fresh Sandwiches, salads, wraps and a decent selection of drinks. Coffees are really worth the price. Good taste but probably insufficient for lunch for the price.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110651958606620480842/reviews
