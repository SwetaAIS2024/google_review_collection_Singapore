Jol C,5,"June at the MBS branch had impeccable service.

I was looking for a pair of black leather shoes, and found the suitable design. However, the MBS store didnâ€™t have my size and June gladly offered to deliver it from another store. After I tried on the new pair, it was unfortunately too big again. She then offered me to try on my right size in another color which fitted me.

As I needed the item on that day, I travelled to the other branch instead. However, her passionate service made me feel reallly comfortable and i will highly recommend anyone to look for her",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111959152892310360968/reviews
Colin Wong,5,Chance walk in. Staff were engaging with feedback and knowledgeable to Qs (unfortunately didnâ€™t recall their names). Shoes are high quality. Itâ€™s a rare positive experience for me enough to want to leave a feedback for them. I hope Ecco will cherish these staff.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101172033169644568663/reviews
