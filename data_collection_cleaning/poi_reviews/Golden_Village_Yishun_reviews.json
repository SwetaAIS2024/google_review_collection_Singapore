      "text": "Kitty and I decided to catch a movie at Golden Village Yishun for a screening of Nei Zha 2. This theatre holds a special place in our hearts.  It was our go-to cinema back in our secondary school days, and it's still here, just as vibrant as we remember it. Stepping back into Golden Village Yishun was like stepping back in time, but with a modern twist. The theatre is even cleaner and more organized than we recall, and the seating is more comfortable.  Before the movie, we even treated ourselves to a relaxing half-hour massage on the massage chairs just outside our theatre.  The air conditioning was cool and refreshing, and the sound quality, as always, was excellent.  It was a delightful trip down memory lane, and we're glad we chose this theatre to enjoy our movie.",
