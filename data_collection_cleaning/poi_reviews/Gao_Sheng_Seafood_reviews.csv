Xan C,1,"Poor service
Vegetables was too salty (inedible level of salty)
Instead of redoing the dish, they washed it
Got back a cold sad wet dish ? So we just didnt eat it
Staff showed no remorse and ignored feedback when we were making payment

Wen Hao Teo,1,"Just the worst zichar stall ever. Waited more than an hour for just a simple hor fun and fried rice.

When asking the daughter of the stall why the order so long. She got the cheek to raise her voice and say will check. After checking her staff still got my order wrong !!

Miserable portion and tasteless food. Come here if u feeling rich and want to throw money at lousy service and food. Oh u must have alot of free time as well ! They won't serve you until it's at least an hour later.

The only reason why they got customer is because nearby not much food options when sunshine place was renovating. Now that sunshine place is up. Just eat there.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115455360246037724699/reviews
Yuzu R,1,"Waiting time super long. Superrr long (like 1h) for any type of dish, and its consistent based on multiple visits even when not busy. Even then, fish was not hot when it came out (the fire that they light below didn't do much either..). Service not that great either btw
Suggest not to patronize for dine in. Can't comment about takeaway",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102990799265638643270/reviews
