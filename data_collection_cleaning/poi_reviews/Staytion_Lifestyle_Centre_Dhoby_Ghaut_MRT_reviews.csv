Capture Asia Photography,4,"Happened to walk pass here and surprise to see a new concept after two decades old. Got some F&B like SaladStop, Kith and Tagaki Ramen. Some shops are not opened yet. Is spacious and cooling for now but not the most impressive as compare to nearby mall like Plaza Singapura.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113796572659279486041/reviews

Star,5,It definitely looks better now after revamp. The layout of the shops are neater and there are seats available for rest. But not many people hang out in this area.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105175046487020301038/reviews
