      "text": "Ainsley hosted our wedding in Hunter Valley and in a wide open farm space. He did an amazing job from giving us ideas to make sequencing smoother than our own plan, probing the vibes we wanted as well as impromptu fillers (that were required due to logistics of a DIY wedding). There was never a moment of awkwardness, he lifted the mood of the crowd.\n\nOverall, he delivered a thoroughly enjoyable time for all the guests and we had lots of positive feedback. I would not hesitate to have him host again.",

Especially his energy, the dance and music was fantastic! Having him as our emcee really gave us a lot less things to worry about as he is so reliable. Ainsley is able to speak in many languages, which allowed him to converse with both the local and foreigner workers from different country with more engagement and entertainment.\n\nThanks so much for bringing much fun and laughter. It was truly beyond our expectations. Highly recommended!!!",
