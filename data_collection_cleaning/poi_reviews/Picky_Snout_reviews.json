Elevates the taste of everything it touches from rosti to pork and chicken.\n\nPros\nRosti crispy and mildly savory very enjoyable.\n\nThey can fried their sunny side up to just right doneness\n\nMeh\nGrilled chicken was average. Creamy mushroom looks good but don't have umami or savory to it.",

      "text": "Rosti stall situated in a heartlander kopitiam of Kovan. Service is alittle slow and prices abit on the high side given that it’s kopitiam. And this kopitiam in the past i always avoid one cause it’s so damn stuffy. Ordered the creamy mushroom chicken rosti($11). I like that it comes with a side of greens. Chicken is nicely grilled and pairs well with the cream sauce. Rosti is relatively crispy not nua like some really lousy ones i had in pasar malam. Overall not too bad.",

But now the chicken chop seem to be fried first before grilled but last time it was grilled nicely.\nRosti was still good and crispy and much better than other shops!\nBut the additional sausage cost $5.90 and was so small in size and miserable. It was too overpriced for me",

Much better versions at Buddy Hoagies or Marche for a bit more cost.  Will give it a hard miss for the future",
