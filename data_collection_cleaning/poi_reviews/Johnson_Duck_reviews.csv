Edmund Tan,1,"Environment is hot.

The meat? ðŸ˜…
I ordered Roast Pork, Char Siew, Roast Duck, Roast Chicken, the meat is super ordinary.. I believe many of the stall outside would beat their meat hands down.

Fragrant Rice, no much fragrant.
The meat dry and hard.

Would never trust this brand anymore.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117267076908226380393/reviews
Marcus Wan,1,"Food is ok, pricing is odd.

Roast duck rice is $4.50.

Roast duck rice, with extra duck is $6.50 (add $2).

Charsiew and roast pork rice is $5.30.

Charsiew, roast pork and roast duck rice is $9.30 (add $4??).

The additional duck costs an extra $4 but the portion of extra duck meat is half of the $4.50 roast duck rice.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112583403085949351456/reviews
D L,3,"The duck is good. Whole duck $20. But it's tough

This packet of duck and char siew with rice $6.30. char siew is flavourful but a bit tough. Achar is a nice addition",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104966613744701231932/reviews
LP Pua,3,"There was more duck meat than what you usually get at other stalls. The taste was okay, but nothing special to shout about.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Song JY,2,"While the food is quite nice, their noodle portion is KID SIZED. finished in a few mouthfuls. Totally not filling

And their meat is inedible because almost all are pure FATS!

Paid $4.50 for roasted pork noodle is already quite ex, but now you cant even eat the meat so imagine paying 4.50 for plain noodles?! Cutthroat..",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103585893321484247472/reviews
