HELEN TAY,5,"Exceptionally good service.
Was hesitant upon reading the reviews about horrible service.  However, the next prata place is a distance away.  So, I decided to take the chance and mine! Am I impressed!
Everyone was smiley, including the diners. We were seated immediately like in a restaurant - not something I would expect of a corner coffeshop.  Menu was brought to us  quickly.   Dishes was served with a smile and ""Enjoy your meal!"".  Everything was fast and efficient from  placing order and paying to the serving of dishes.

Cheese prata is excellent.  Crispy n tasty shredded cheddar cheese.  Maggie goreng is good.  Curry fish is ok.

Atmosphere is a dark tone like a ""bar"" feel.  Modern pendant lamps.  Clean tables.  Toilets need some work though.

Will come again for sure.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116120211127023719040/reviews
