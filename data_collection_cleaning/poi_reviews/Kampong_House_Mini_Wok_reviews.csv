AC Chan,4,"The sight of sliced fish served in an old-school aluminium steamboat pot is too tempting to resist.
The soup is savoury with lots of won bok [a.k.a. Chinese cabbage], tomatoes and tofu. However, the fried fish slices are mostly batter with just a morsel of fish meat within.
On the other hand, the prawn paste chicken [a.k.a. har cheong gai] is a must try here. We love the crispy golden-brown skin with juicy meat and the fermented shrimp 🦐 paste is strong!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Derrick Lin,3,"Order the Tom yum fish at $9.60 with rice. Very large serving, with lots of fish and vegetables…I think it’s enough for two. Overall it’s okay, but I think it’s kind of like drinking ketchup plus chilli water , half way through, taste fatigue kicks in and you don’t feel like eating anything anymore",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105989843156970934066/reviews
