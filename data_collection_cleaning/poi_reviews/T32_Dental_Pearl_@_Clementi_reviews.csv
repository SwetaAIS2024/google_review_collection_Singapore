Zachary Koh,5,"Visited Dr Benjamin Koh today for a simple cleaning appointment. However, he still took his time to perform his job meticulously, patiently explaining each step he is about to take. His kindness and empathy shows when talking to his assistant or patient. Truly one of the most remarkable dentist I have met. Overall was an extremely pleasant visit and would make him my regular dentist.

Would recommend Dr Koh to anyone looking for quality dental care over anything else.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114516821121719023145/reviews
