Vijay Mehra,5,"Dear Dr Tan,

A huge Thank You to you and Dr Toh for your Excellence, your Problem-Solving, and your Expertise in your fields.

You worked as a Team both for the surgery and for the post-op recovery period, to safely and quickly bring me back from a very delicate situation of intestinal adhesions and suspected Intussusception of my intestine caused due to a previous surgery many years ago in India - appendix- which led to related adhesions and food-induced obstruction.

I am now back at work and traveling again in Asia Pacific.

I am forever indebted to both of you.

With Deepest Gratitude,
Vijay Mehra
