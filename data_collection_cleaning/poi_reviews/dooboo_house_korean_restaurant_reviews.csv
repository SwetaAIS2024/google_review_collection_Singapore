Jamie sim,5,"Nice restaurant with house made fresh tofu run by very friendly Korean lady boss !
Paid RM85 for 3 dishes - seafood tofu soup, grilled saba fish & pan fried tofu.
It’s located at level 2 so need to find the staircase entrance beside Kopitiam.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100185795230024660335/reviews
Han Zi Teo (Zee),5,"The tofu is wonderful! Definitely worth finding this hidden gem. Ordered the grilled pork, tofu stew with kimchi and the fried tofu, all superb decisions. Will definitely be back again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108476612773361844976/reviews
Ocean Chua,3,"The interior of the restaurant is decent but what’s horrendous is the absolute disgusting service this restaurant provides. Asking for a refill of side dishes will deliver you with an unpleasant glare as if you’ve done something wrong. The staff’s attitude is unwelcoming, and any request seems to inconvenience them. It’s a complete shame because the food has potential, but the service ruins the experience entirely. If you value good customer service, this is not the place for you.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118350659453469458711/reviews
K.H. Lee,5,"Hey, my global gourmet friends in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Do you seriously want to experience the Korean cuisine, taste, care and kindness, hospitality, friendship and etc....? The right answer is this Dooboo House. They make the most nutritious Tofu themselves and serve all the table in genuine manners you will really appreciate and remember so long. They are so good at welcoming, cooking and serving. I've visited just once today but, they deserve to be known and praised more. I am really proud of them. Visit and enjoy Korean Spirit!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107806021094053149246/reviews
