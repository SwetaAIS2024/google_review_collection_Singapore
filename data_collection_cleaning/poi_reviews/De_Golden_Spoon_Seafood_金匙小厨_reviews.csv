Gavin Chai,5,"Another good tsi char in SG serving fresh and decent food. Went for a wine and dine with friends before xmas and ordered an abundant of food but only get to take the pictures for the razor clam and crab meehoon as both dishes are the main highlight of that night.

The clams were big (and pricey) but freshly prepared and cut into bite sizes, steamed with generous serving of glass noodles topped with garlic and soy sauce.

Crab meehoon is packed with umami but not as heavy as the ones in Yang Ming. The crab is big, juicy and succulent.

Other dishes like coffee ribs, crispy chicken are not in the picture because they are gone too fast.

The environment and service are what you normally expect of from such restaurant, not too bad, not excellent either. Nominal corkage charges applies.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111531668040893577385/reviews
J L,4,"Food portions are relatively bigger and more affordable compared to other zi char restaurants.

Coffee ribs are tasty. The cripsy chicken was surprisingly tender and not dry! But a bit small for whole chicken. The crab beehoon is  very flavourful. We ordered the larger prawns (cost $7 per piece), which are fresh. Cereal prawns were good, but should have tried the stir fried garlic instead to appreciate the freshness of the prawns even more. Vegetables well stir fried! The large sized claypot tofu is really huge.

My parents are picky eaters, and surprisingly mum gave thumbs up for this restaurant- said all the dishes are very 入味 and not too salty!

Service is efficient. Washrooms are very clean. Ambience is good- not noisy.
Can park at the open carpark right outside the restaurant, so its very convenient.

Will come back again!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109582284728240689665/reviews
Lily Choo,4,"We order crab beehoon & crispy fried sotong. Tasty& flavourful. Only we feel very thirsty after meal. Very crowded, must eat fast, can't enjoy eat slowly here. We feel sad can't get the table in the aircon room. After that we feel lucky to sit outside because we see inside is so packed & noisy.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110597603861969309056/reviews
Matthew Lee,4,"A colleague recommended this place for a gathering and we decided to visit and it is almost everyone's first time except for the colleague who recommended.
She was the one also decided on the dishes to order so we just sat and waited for the food to come.
A very retro and old school Chinese restaurant still very crowded on a weekday night and there were many other foreigners as well.
Ordered enough dishes to share, and the small was already decent enough for 6 people everyone got to try a bit of everything in each dish.
First had the fried sotong which was pretty nostalgic,  don't get to eat this dish often. The sauce is sweet and a little sour, making it quite appetizing to start the meal and eat other dishes.
Did a wrong order, wanted to order a vegetable dish ended up them getting us a plate of seasonal greens while we already ordered the spinach with 3 different types of eggs. Nonetheless both were different style and pretty decent as well. I loved the wet and soupy spinach with eggs more and felt it was executed very well.
Har jeong gai is probably one of the signature dishes to order, as well as the salt and pepper ribs. Nothing to fault and was quite tasty. Not really a fan of ribs but somehow this dish won me over and I thought it was better than the chicken because of the flavours.
Last dish wanted the homemade tofu but also ended up ordering the seafood claypot tofu instead. To me it was a pretty good dish with all the ingredients I liked and also the gravy was so good if I didn't control myself would have easily downed with a couple of bowls of rice.
It was a good meal and also was surprised it was quite reasonable after splitting the bill. Not a bad place to visit and I would recommend making reservations cause it can be quite crowded even on weekday nights.

G Wong,5,By far one of the better seafood places in Singapore. Their signature crab bee hoon has a nice “wok hei” and a very thick seafood taste. Their chilli crab and salted egg crab were very good as well. Their fried baby squid is a must have.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102487169418305364045/reviews
