HX C,1,"Bought the same chilled sparkling water two days in a row. First day, the indian cashier charged me $1. Next day, the chinese cashier didn't scan the barcode and charged me $1.30. When asked about the discrepancy, I was told there was an additional charge for drink because it was cold. Nice lie. Don't make payment with the Chinese cashier, you might receive a 30% markup on chilled goods. Who knows, you might even be charged for standing in their aircon.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111198695651406133587/reviews
