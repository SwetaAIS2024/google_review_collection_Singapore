They gave great, insightful tips about basic kart fundamentals and what to look out for when out on the track.\nThey also recorded videos of me on track, giving advice on the line choices and braking markers, which were really useful and definitely cut down my time because of that! Will definitely come back to you guys again üôèüèª",

Although weather conditions was not the best, Coach Ijan made the best out of it and managed to teach me a lot during the session. Mechanic Zach was also of great help to ensure the kart was ready before heading out. Thanks for making the session an enjoyable one!",

My 10 year old son enjoyed his time on the track so much and made 30 seconds improvement of track time within one trial! It‚Äôs amazing. The karts are also in good conditions and well maintained. Thank you Ijaan and team for the passion and commitment you portray in this sport! :)",
