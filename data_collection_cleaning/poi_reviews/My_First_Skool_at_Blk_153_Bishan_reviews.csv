K H chua,5,"I highly recommend this preschool. My son started as an infant and went onto PG with them before we moved out of the area. Throughout the time he was there, the teachers were caring and taught him many things. I particularly like that he learnt daily skills like taking off his shoes, zipping his bag, eating independently etc.

Personally, I also like that the school emphasises care towards the environment and inculcated the practice of recycling, reusing and even upcycling materials we come across in our daily lives. This helps my child to look beyond the self and to consider the larger environment he lives in and looks for ways for sustainable living.

The Principal is a highly hands-on person who knows all the children’s names. She spends time with them in the classrooms and helps with their transition from class to class. The teachers are also professional and passionate about their work. They keep the parents informed in a timely manner on updates regarding the child and other school events.

I am really happy that my child got off to a great start in life at this preschool. Keep up the good work, Ms Lin and teachers!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861755191383960184/reviews
