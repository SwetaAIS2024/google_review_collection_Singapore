HC L,3,"Tried the Hainanese pork chop rice. The pork chop was hot and freshly deep fried but it was quite hard and overcooked. Tomato sauce was very sweet, perhaps they can place it on the side? The fries were surprisingly good- crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. May be back to try the other dishes but not the pork chop rice.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
Patrick Goh,5,"Premium Irish butter matched perfectly with crispy toasted white bread, aromatic & tasty laksa broth, surprisingly perfect canned pork knuckles fried bee hoon‚Ä¶better than staple Hokkien style.
Best of all‚Ä¶traditional strong & Hainanese KOPI & TEH in modern thick porcelain cups. üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105723423860642238828/reviews
Wesley Wong,4,"This local eatery at Kallang Leisure Park specialises in traditional Singaporean food, offering an authentic experience of classic dishes like kaya toast, soft-boiled eggs, and noodles. The quality of the food and beverages here is notably superior to larger chains such as Ya Kun Kaya Toast or Toast Box, making it a standout choice for those seeking genuine flavors. The kaya toast is perfectly crispy with a generous spread of fragrant kaya. Whether you‚Äôre in the mood for a hearty breakfast or a satisfying snack, this spot delivers a delightful taste of Singaporean heritage. If you‚Äôre in the area, it‚Äôs definitely worth stopping by for a flavorful and fulfilling meal.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107433449088212182977/reviews
MightyFoodie,5,"Their Curry Chicken is rich and aromatic, highly recommended to go along wjth the toast bread or a bowl of rice. Dont quite like their Hainanese Pork Chop as the sauce is way too sweet.

Lociko Qisu,5,"Came here for lunch, swift service and the place was not that crowded. Food wise is pretty good and the price is decent considering the inflation this year, was able to relax while waiting for the rain to pass. Feel like the beverage option was kinda limited but I guess it doesn't quite fit the theme of cafe that well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104101787712319383669/reviews
