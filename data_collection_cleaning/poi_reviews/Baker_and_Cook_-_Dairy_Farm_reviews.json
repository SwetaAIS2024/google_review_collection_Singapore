Makes you feel that you're getting a good bang for your price. The freshly made pizza, made to order in their nice big oven. Wow the pizza is really amazing. Really nice.",

The brand is always located in nice neighborhoods so we werenâ€™t surprised to see it spring up in this estate.. the plush greenery around adds to a nice atmosphere. Came on a weekend morning but place got progressively crowded towards lunch. Both indoor and alfresco options and the staff were helpful in getting us seated. They have a really nice array of breads and cakes, and a good Xmas vibe all around.",

Went to pick up some breads, always love their artisan sliced bread. And decided to stay back for pizza & drink. Sourdough pizza (by plank) is highly recommended, perfectly paired by  wine by glass (at reasonable price).\nVery nice and friendly staff/crew, enjoy my time there and will be back again! Keep up the great work team!",
