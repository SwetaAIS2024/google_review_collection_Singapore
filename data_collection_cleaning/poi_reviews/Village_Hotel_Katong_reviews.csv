Vivian Guzik,5,"The hotel is very clean and rooms are spacious. Very convenient as it's nearby the train station, bus stops, shopping malls and cinema. There's a supermarket below the hotel. Many food shops and bars nearby as well. The staff are all very welcoming. Always smile and greets the guests. Arina did great assisting us during our check in. Answered my queries with smile and confidence. I will definitely come back again.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112574915053261127662/reviews
Mai,5,"I stayed here for two nights during a work trip to Singapore and had a good experience. The hotel kindly upgraded me to a room with a bathtub, but I didn’t get to use it because of my busy schedule. The room was clean, big and had everything I needed. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was fine, though it could be better. Location is close to a train station and a bus stop, plus there’s a grocery store downstairs and a few good restaurants. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. ❤️",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106556522820972545127/reviews
mahesh chainani,4,"Stayed here on my holiday in Singapore. Very good location with easy access to public transport. The only problem with the room is the glass walls for the bathroom. Using the bathroom in the middle of the night, the light disturbs the other occupant.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114150424680203793163/reviews
Adam Lindqvist,4,"Very professional and friendly staff at the hotel.
Rooms were nice but the craftsmanship of wallpaper and caulking etc. is not the best work I've seen.
Pool area is nice, however I don't know how many hours a day there is sun in this spot.
Overall I'm really happy with my stay.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101106695946365182346/reviews
Alyanna Brillantes,5,"Booked this on the last day of my business trip since this is located a bit closer to the airport. Nice price to value ratio. Love the balcony! The bed is comfortable. Room is spacious and very clean with thoughtful amenities (towels, hand towels, sanitary bag, shower cap, dental kit, toiletries). Love the accessibility of the toilet as well. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Location is also nice since it’s just a few minutes walk from Bus stops and the Brown Line MRT which leads you to many tourist spots (I recommend to get the Brown line route to Gardens by the bay than the Blue line - more accessible and comfortable route)

I also love the virtual passport / guide they provide (though this is via QR code) which is helpful for tourists. The neighborhood is very cool. Less crowd and I had a peaceful stay. This is my 2nd time in Singapore and I loved the East coast more. Highly recommended for those who want to visit Singapore.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110712015967286561131/reviews
