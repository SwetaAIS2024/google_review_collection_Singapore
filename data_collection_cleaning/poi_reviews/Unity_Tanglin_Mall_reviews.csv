Yu Min,5,"Conveniently located near our office, this outlet is perfect for lunchtime errands. The staff are always helpful and pleasant, but Ms. Helen ( a senior lady on duty today at around 2-3 pm ) truly stood out. Her kind and empathetic nature shone through as she offered cost-saving bulk purchase advice and ensured I could comfortably carry my items. Her genuine concern was heartwarming and commendable. Thank you, Ms. Helen, for exceptional service!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115186176965895250422/reviews

Aurore Van Hoof,1,"Not really helpful , bad service !! Not wealing to try the QR pay when this option exist on their nets machine... just telling me they don’t have that option without even trying !! I’m using exactly the same old nets machine where I don’t even have the paywave but the QR pay can !!
Just telling me you can’t because you don’t know how it work doesn’t resolve problem ... at least you try it ... and if it work you can learn a new thing.
Lack of service.
Working myself in service and my pay wave is not working.
When customers are not happy with it or don’t believe, you try in front of them to show that is not working and not because you don’t want to make an effort !!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106891683515891760704/reviews
