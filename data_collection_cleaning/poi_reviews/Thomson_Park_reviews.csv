NaveeN KumaR,5,"A small park in Thompson area, I don't think the size should dictate the stars. So giving 5 stars as it is so clean and neatly maintained even though it is a small park.
There is a children play area and some seaters with sunshade.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101587771686434373130/reviews

Ramesh Ramakrishnan Iyer,5,"The park is very small it has a covered shelter for you to sit and relax a few places for you to play Chinese checkers and a small children's park it's no more than 300 to 400 square feet so don't expect much from this park most of the time you will find the workers from the nearby construction sites relaxing in this place and sometimes young people come around to have a smoke or just drink and chit chat ....I found the park a good place to just relax and meet people when it is relatively empty.... it is very close to the yellow wall Taoist temple and right behind the shop houses where you can buy some food, the famous roti Prata house limited is located here, and if you're up to it bring it to the park and sit down and eat but definitely people will stare at you.... hahahaha",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105437702363751748354/reviews
