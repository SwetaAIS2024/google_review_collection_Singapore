But don't let the run down outlook fool you, as the food is superb and supremely affordable. My third time there and the place still doesn't disappoint. Worth at least a try.",

This feeds 5 people.\n\nOrder at the front where all the fresh seafood are.\n\nIdeally, the ability to speak Malay would widen your menu choices.",

The restaurant offers a unique floating ambience with stunning views of the estuary and surrounding mangrove environment. The menu features a variety of fresh seafood, including prawns, crabs, and fish, all prepared with rich spices and flavours. The price, depending on the menu selection and might be high if you take the lobster.",
