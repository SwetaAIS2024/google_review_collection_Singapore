This is like robbing.\nAnd the item has no price tag .\nNEVER EVER BUY FROM THIS SHOP. Unless you like to be “robbed”.\nI don’t know what is it more than 4 stars it should be ZERO stars",

She was very knowledgeable and managed to provide answers my enquiries .\nAlthough things here are generally pricier being in Orchard area , I still bought  some stuff because I have not seen them at my regular shops.\nAlso the best part is that this place only stocks freshwater fish so you are assured that you are not buying the wrong fish . I was also impressed by the range of small and medium- sized  fish .",
