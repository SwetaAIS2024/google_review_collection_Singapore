Shawn,1,"Overpriced Indian Muslim Stall (Al Zara) charges $8 for a Nasi Goreng Ayam. If this was at Orchard Road, I would be ok with the price. But no, this store is located in the an industrial area. When I asked him about the price, he says its the normal price for a plate of Nasi Goreng Ayam. I dont know who is he trying to scam because the average pricing is around $5-$6. Do not patronise this stall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111040976454245054644/reviews
