The sound wasnâ€™t as good as some other places we have visited, probably it is outdoors.\n\nThe place has a weird policy that diners have to leave a credit card at the counter when we started the order. Donâ€™t feel good about this, especially seeing that all the credit cards are kept at a counter, risk of being easily getting scammed by detecting the cards. Seriously think the place should review this unsafe policy.",

Servers were not attentive to outdoor tables, and unfamiliar with the menu.\n\nPerformers lacked professionalism. Singer was shaky and pitchy. Some wrong notes were played.\n\nWater is chargeable.\n\nFor the price of the food, all of this is unacceptable.",

      "text": "customer service is quite nonchalant and slow, staff doesn't bother to help. my fish and chips came, the fish came absolutely raw. PINK MEAT RAW. i told the staff nicely and all they said \"cook again ah\" the other staff asked if i wanted them to cook it again or cook a new portion. I felt that this situation was handled very badly with no professionalism. I would appreciate it if an apology can be given with a full refund of the dish. My friends and i couldn't finish the meal as the food was not delectable. The fish was not fresh, with a strong fishy rotting smell, the chicken came cold, the fries was average and barely edible. I hope that other customers can get better service with proper professionalism. we ordered three dishes with two drinks and paid $82 ðŸ˜Ÿ",

      "text": "The food at Tipsy Bunny was great, and the atmosphere was quite enjoyable. The prices were acceptable for the quality provided. However, the customer service left much to be desired. The server seemed uninterested, and what bothered me was when she started clearing our table before we had even finished our meal. There was still pizza on the plate when she began removing dishes. This kind of service really took away from an otherwise pleasant dining experience. I understand that business is business, and maybe this is part of their plan, but it didnâ€™t sit well with us.\n\nI appreciate your concern.\nHope can do better in the future.\nGreat jobs!",
