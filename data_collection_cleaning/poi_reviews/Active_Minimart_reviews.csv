Lindt MM,5,"Store is well maintained & very clean environment. Stocks are stacked neatly & easy to locate. They also separate the halal & non halal products. A lot of good buys such as packet drinks, pet bottle drinks, instant noodles etc.
Today i bought a pack of cintan noodles for 50 cents & canned spicy 🌶 anchovies for the same price too. A good  assortment of chips & ice creams. 🍦 I found my favourite childhood snack- HIRO CHOCOLATE 🍫 cake here!!!!
The store helper is friendly too. Look out for special offer items which are displayed near the cashier counter & outside the shop. 😊 Happy 🛒 shopping",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106081966351615781892/reviews
