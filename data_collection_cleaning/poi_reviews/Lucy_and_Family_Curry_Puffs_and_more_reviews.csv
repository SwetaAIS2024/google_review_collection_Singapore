Affinity T,5,"Very glad to find them and after trying all flavours of their bak zhang, i will be a regular customer haha.  We opted for delivery as pre-orders are required and it's convenient.  The rice dumplings are the best so far for my family and me. It is non-commercial, not salty and they use fresh ingredients (eg.1 whole fresh salted egg for their salted egg bak zhang).  It feels very 'family', something like mum or grandma would make with good ingredients in mind.  The kee zhang and kee zhang with red bean exceeded expectations as generally kee zhangs are not easy to make due to texture.  Curry puffs are very nice too with the right amount of spice.  Will be trying more items from them and hope they will continue to keep their high standards!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102415582635153594281/reviews
