The empty car park in B2 makes it very convenient for shoppers and mall users.\n\nI have just opened my facial skincare spa in B1 and have been keeping busy thanks to all the residents' support.\n\nSophia\nSkincare by Sophia",

A McSpicy meal combined with Coke Zero is will freshen up your day just right.\n\nü•™ Subway is small but great place to hangout with friends. Very clean and homelike. Food is healthy and refreshing. The sandwhiches are so tasty! ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nüåªüå∏ The floral shop has a variety of flowers from roses, to sunflowers to tulips. The place itself is centred right at the heart of Siglap Centre so it's easy to notice. Bought my mom's bday gift here.\n\nSiglap Centre is a classic of Siglap. Been visiting this place since I was young. Amazing place to hangout and chill !!",
