Ume-IYMAN,5,"Didn't go inside but seeing an international Arab school in Singapore, just gave me goosebumps.
Building looks neat and clean. It has credentials naming it apple school of the year. I'm sure the teachers work diligently. The academic environment in Singapore is already highly competitive. You can't stay in one mind set for too long or your kids will lag behind.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116095774061865499877/reviews
