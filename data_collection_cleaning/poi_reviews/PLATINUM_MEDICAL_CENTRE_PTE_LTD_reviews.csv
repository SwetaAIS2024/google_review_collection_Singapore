Ckrystal Chin,5,"Dr Ram is extremely patient and knowledgeable. The consultation was also very smooth with him sharing more symptoms about asthma. Thank you for the pleasant experience, Dr Ram :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115908804426501178181/reviews
Ann Tan,5,"2nd time here because 1st time experience was very good. Location and facility is great.  They have their own X-ray machine and clinic is in a quiet part of Yishun, some queue but this is normal. Doctors and staff are extremely patient and friendly.  They bother to explain what's  going on rather than merely prescribe MCs and medication leaving you ignorant of your condition.  Highly recommend.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105996823019209161614/reviews
Joseph ang,1,"The doctor gave a wrong diagnosis. I had symptoms of a highly contagious disease/virus, but they were brushed off. The next day, I went to another clinic for a second opinion because I was certain there was more to it and I was diagnosed correctly right away.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114504115236836813399/reviews
Toh Jin Yi,1,"Visited this clinic, hoping to have a straightforward blood test done for a health screening, but was incredibly disappointed by the experience. FIRSTLY, this wasn’t even my first time here, I came last week for the same blood test and despite poking my arm and wrist several times, they said my vein was too small and I was asked to come another day. (Which is today) AND TODAY, same shit again. What’s worst is, the doctor is the one doing the blood test for me. Isn’t this just a very BASIC procedure? If they AT LEAST apologised for it, I wouldn’t be so pissed off. But instead of apologising for it they were constantly citing various reasons like oh my vein were small, I didn’t drink enough water etc, does that mean everyone with small veins have to be poke countless times for a BASIC blood test?  If you’re looking for a clinic where even simple medical tests can be done, this is not the place to go. I won’t be returning and would suggest looking elsewhere for more reliable care.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100307464894963605912/reviews
Na Wang,5,"Doctor very nice .
It can help me check my physical condition carefully. It makes me feel at ease. Even if I am sick, I will not feel stressed. The front desk service is very good. It can help me make appointments for other physical examinations. It is very considerate of patients. It is very reassuring to see a doctor here. I sincerely thank the doctor and the front desk",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114765262805935149679/reviews
