HC L,3,"Pretty decent claypot frog legs with porridge. Also ordered a Chye por omelette. 3 of us: total $40.
This coffee shop has a lot of smokers either side of the seating (even the non smoking side) Some even smoked beside the tables (in the middle of the coffee shop).",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
Alan Lzp,3,"Went over to try the promotion, it was cheap and portions were good. I ate alone and could not finish it. The taste was average, might visit to try other items. They have a promotion for crab, 2 for $50.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111108744099675089998/reviews
Mel JH Tan,4,"Tried their tian ji zhou (frog porridge), which is not a typical dish to sell in a Zi Char stall. The dried chilli frog is good; generous w the sauce, alight spicy kick, frog is well cooked. but the porridge was a little more watery than those thick kinds that leave your lips sticky (as it should be). Overall, decent neighbourhood meal.

Came back here a second time to try the beef hor fun. Weird cause they add onions inside for the black bean hor fun. Don't recommend, no wok hey also.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104265155304455776774/reviews
Chan “Toffees” Allen,5,"Nicest Tze Char stall in Toa Payoh Lorong 1. Price is reasonable and service is great too. Boss is a hardworking chap with his team providing good food. Stall is located in a windy location, great with unblock view along the main road. Not many coffee shops can match this. Recommended food are Curry Fish Head, Sambal Petai Fried Rice, Curry Pork Rice, French Beans with Dry Shrimps, Fried Spare Ribs",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110097176985965725951/reviews
Murks Mana,5,The sambal fried is so heavenly! And the special pork ribs is a treat. One of the good zi char restaurants in Toa Payoh. I will soon try their other dishes.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117923319816294145236/reviews
