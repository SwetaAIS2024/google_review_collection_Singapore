狄开伟,5,"Our son Di Hao had a marvelous time at Carpe Diem Springs Preschool. We visited several other schools before but were immediately convinced that Carpe Diem Springs was the right choice for us because of the relaxed atmosphere and the warm and cheerful teachers. Children have loads of fun while learning and the teachers truly have attention for more than only cognitive learning. They also learn important life skills such as creativity and healthy living. Kids are respected and encouraged in a positive and loving way. Their independence is trained which boosts their confidence. If you want your child to have a balanced, joyful and multi-faceted early learning experience, Carpe Diem Springs Preschool is a great option.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112659929432296564807/reviews

Jun Hui,5,"Put my 2 children in Carpe Diem Springs since 2017. The teachers are caring and work closely with parents on the holistic well-being of the child. Curriculum wise, I love the 8 multiple intelligences concept and the teachers taught my children many things while adhering to this concept. The school also helps to prepare the k2 students for p1 so that the transition for the kids is as smooth as possible. Never regretted or looked back on my decision. Thank you teachers and staff of Carpe Diem Springs!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114496806215552739715/reviews
