Free crackers whilst waiting for food.\n\nOrdered KL Hokkien Mee, Penang Fried Kway Teow, BKT (dry), Herbal chicken, Muar Otak, Braised Lobak.\n\nGenerally pretty ok. Hokkien Mee had a nice smoky taste. Fried Kway Teow didn't quite have the wokhei but still acceptable. Otak was nice, quite authentic. Lobak quite close to Penang ones. Dry BKT and herbal chicken were so-so, nothing to shout about.",

Service was good just that the place was a bit warm and when you leave you will definitely have BBQ smell on you. Overall not too bad.",

      "text": "Borders close but you can consider dropping by this place for some Malaysia Lok Lok! I feel it‚Äôs quite authentic. They offer fried and steamed Lok Lok dishes. Thumbs up for their fried Lok Lok dishes, it was delicious.\n\nCrowded but the staffs were still very attentive to every request of customers. Lots and lots of selection, the prawns were really huge, and it‚Äôs peeled! Favorite items included fried crab stick, sliced abalone, luncheon meat, enoki mushroom, cheese tofu and satay! Occasionally, the staffs will also go around serving fried items like seaweed chicken, satay, nuggets, chicken wings, fried tofu skin and etc.\n\nVery satisfied after eating and 3 of us in total drank 9 cups of drinks!! For the buffet, it includes free flow of drinks, from hot beverages to canned drink, and even home made drinks like ice lemon tea and lime juice.\n\nNote: Buffet is for 2 hours! Ice cream is also served at the end. üëçüèº",

Occasionally Chef will serve you satay and chicken wings and some happening pork strips all deep fried ! Yummy! Buffet served at $25-26 per pax, comes with free flow drinks, ice cream, coffee and also crackers! You can choose your items and just let it boil or put a white peg on the plate to note that you want them deep fried . Look for Kelly who manages e restaurant there. Totally cheerful and nice. Wish there were more outlets like these. Pure and simple everytime !",
