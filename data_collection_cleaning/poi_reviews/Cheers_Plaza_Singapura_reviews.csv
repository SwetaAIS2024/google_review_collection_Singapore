Jessica Wang,1,"The cashier named Doris seems to have either a personality issue or a problem with her attitude. Every time a customer comes to shop, she ends up scolding them. If you report or complain to the company, and she finds out, she will start ranting at you even more. She never thinks she’s the problem.

There are several other convenience stores in Plaza Singapura, so unless you specifically want to experience a shopping trip where you get scolded, there’s really no need to go there.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110593790930342321197/reviews
Rylee Ang,1,The aunty doris has no manners towards customers. I ask her where is the power bank at she told me is at the cashier there. When i walk there i didnt realise it was on the table so i stood there and wait for her to come. When she was finished doing her things she walk to me and pointed at it and say “有没有搞错” with a angry tone. She don’t even have the correct attitude for customer service.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107750966346840692409/reviews

Besharps,3,Small Cheers outlet that has many convenient meals and drinks. It has a microwave and hot water available for use for convenient and instant meals. It's also quite accessible as it is located just outside of Dhoby Ghaut MRT and near to a bus stop.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111020676081888304196/reviews
