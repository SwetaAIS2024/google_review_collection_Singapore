Sam Toh (Sammy),1,"New set up, taking over the Indian food operator. Tried their Mee Goreng topped with two sunny side up. The mee goreng was bland, noodles all broke into small pieces and there is very little flavour to it. The eggs are cold and look like it's being left outside for quite sometime. This place used to be my roti prata hangout. With the food standard, won't be coming back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110777175975209979259/reviews
Ban Drecha,1,"Searching for a place for my weekly lunch with 3 kids after football practice, I decided to try this place and regret now having done this. Small piece of chicken and I had to beg for a second piece of cucumber. Next time I'll go buy four meals at the neighbors.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100534036062818188764/reviews
