Yvonne Yee,5,"Reasonably priced salad / protein bowl in CBD area. Always long Q during lunch but move fairly fast. Crew is friendly too especially for those who is new and lost. Ingredients are fresh , cooked items are tasty enough usually I order without dressing. Appreciate the 2 base option and wish the protein portion can be bigger. Overall good.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106525972077790864123/reviews

Joyce Lim,3,"Very little protein, only 80g max. Sgd9.8, quite cheap. Chicken thigh fatty and full of skin, drenched in soy sauce, bad for clean eating. Soba inferior quality. Can't taste the sauce. Broccoli undercooked and charred. Service was alright. Place always has long queue but I won't be back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114306834103372851451/reviews
KC Heng,3,"Protein (like chicken breast) always run out after 1pm. And the leftover protein like salmon, beef are usually those that needs to top up money

Wouldn’t the shop think about preparing more chicken breast to cater to the needs? Or just out to make people choose the more expensive protein

And overall the meal isn’t exactly cheap too $10+",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104888112074983008196/reviews
