Oswin Choo,5,"Pleasantly surprised! The flavors were bold but balanced. You could tell the chefs put a lot of thought into how the different cuisines would complement each other, rather than just mixing ingredients for the sake of it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105531694743471339341/reviews
Sharmala Huey Yuen Bala Raju,5,"I definitely love this place, it's discreet and has a beautiful view of the mosque. The mixologists are friendly, professional and know their stuff! Been coming here for years and still my favourite joint in the neighbourhood. Shout out to Ethan who made our gorgeous drinks last night, tasted as good as they looked! Thank you!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108750648215815006825/reviews
Bingy The Biscuitboy,4,"My friend wanted to try the Bespoke Bar when we were nearby Arab street but it was full when we went twice. There was no way to reserve seating calling or physically, and can only be done via online booking. We went elsewhere that night.

On the 2nd night, we tried our luck again and managed to get a seating after waiting for 15 minutes as another table left earlier. The bartender (Kenneth) was very friendly and fun to chat with. We ordered quite a few drinks based on his recommendation. I can’t really remember the names of the drinks and would be good if Maison Ikkoku could reply me here for learning pleasure for all. Oh, we also tried the Escargo and that was my first time as I’ve never liked the idea of eating it but hey, it was really garlicky soft and nice. I might try Escargo again!

Overall 10/10 would return as the ambience is very nice despite a place with little seating. But that makes it cosy and exclusive.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113849139533284358108/reviews
Pauline Yoong,4,A very cool bar on the second level of conserved shop house. The drinks are very pretty and there is a really nice scent that they used inside. At the back of the bar there is an outdoor area that overlooks the largest mosque in Singapore. Too bad this bar is closing soon. Hope another operator will take over.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109959124710224590577/reviews

This is the place to go if you are looking for custom-made cocktails, good quality food  with excellence service. The mixologist will create unique cocktails base on your preference and it delivered exactly what we wanted. The food was great as each dish was prepared with attention to details.
