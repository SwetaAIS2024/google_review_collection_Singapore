Adrian Teo,5,"My daughter has been learning under Teacher Keefe since Sec 1 and is currently in Sec 3, where he is now teaching her A Math. He is able to identify her weaker areas and effectively correct them. He takes the time to go through her school test papers in detail, pinpointing the exact reasons for any marks lost and helping her improve strategically.

His dedication, thorough approach, combined with his engaging teaching style, has made a significant difference in her understanding and confidence in the subject. We are very happy to have such a committed tutor. Highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109996493975512642938/reviews
Agnes Tan,5,"My daughter truly enjoys Teacher Seri’s classes, and that means a lot to us. Thanks to your engaging and effective teaching methods, she has been able to focus better and stay interested in the topics. It’s the first time my Primary 5 daughter scored full marks on a paper — and we only started lessons with you in December 2024! Thank you, Teacher Seri, for making such a positive difference in her learning journey!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113405026178422362672/reviews

Leah Lim,5,"My son joined teacher Seri’s lesson and he really enjoyed the fun experiments and clear explanations. Tr seri will also provide summary of what was taught and the important key words to note for the parents and these information is good for my son to take note for revisions. As a result, he managed to score well for his science and improve by 2 grades. Thank you for helping my boy!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102389022305626562608/reviews
陳宗仁,5,"My son scored full marks in his P5 Term 1 Science WA, and I couldn’t be more proud! Ever since he joined Blue Tree under the guidance of Teacher Seri, his love for Science has grown, and his grades have improved tremendously.

P5 is not easy, but Teacher Seri makes the learning journey smooth and enjoyable. She explains concepts so clearly that Isaac understands them effortlessly. The best part? Science tuition has become something he actually looks forward to every week!

Thank you, Teacher Seri and Blue Tree, for making Science so fun and engaging. Highly recommend to any parent looking for a solid Science foundation for their child!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117636976420013814045/reviews
