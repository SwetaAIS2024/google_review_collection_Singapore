A bit spicy üå∂Ô∏è for delivery (Chicken basil rice w/egg: dine-in at S$7.30, jumps magically to S$10.24 online after discount‚Äîmust be the Wi-Fi seasoning üôÑ). But hey, it's 2025, and merchants love playing \"Guess My Real Price\" anyway, right?\n\nConsidering the flavor-packed meal, I might bravely venture into the actual restaurant next time. Just gotta mentally prep myself to ignore that spooky 2.8/5 Google Maps rating‚Äîmaybe wear garlic around my neck just to be safe. üçΩÔ∏èüßÑüò±",

      "text": "Food is good, and the service is generally fast given how crowded this stall is.  Will definitely come back again.\n\nAnd let me just say something after reading some of the reviews because I feel someone needs to say something.\n\nGuys, this is a foodcourt outlet where the Pad Thai is $6+ and it's good quality.  This is not a high end restaurant and they don't charge service charge.  So why must some customers demand they smile and give you fantastic customer service? Please be more considerate. F&B staff work very hard and very long hours. So don't go around giving them one star ratings just because they did not lick your boots and go out of their way to please you.   Let's all be kinder.",
