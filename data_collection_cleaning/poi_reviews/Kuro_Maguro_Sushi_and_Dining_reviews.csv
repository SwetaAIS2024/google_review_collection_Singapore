derek neo,4,"I recently had lunch at Kuro Maguro, a Japanese restaurant with a cozy atmosphere and both indoor and outdoor seating options. For lunch, we opted for the Maguro 5-cut Sashimi, grilled Kuro Maguro ribs, and crispy fried oysters. Each dish exceeded our expectations, with exceptionally fresh ingredients and impressive flavors.

Lok Lin,5,"Outstanding sashimi, one of the best in Singapore ! the lunch is around $34. It is well worth it. The sashimi was fresh, I like the way they cut the sashimi, Otaro Maguro.
Highly recommend",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102085598899123756811/reviews
x chubbykitty,5,"The Maguro 5 Cuts Sashimi was incredibly fresh, with each cut showcasing a different texture and flavor — pure melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The Aburi Toro Roll with Truffle Sauce was rich and flavorful, with just the right touch of smokiness from the sear and an umami boost from the truffle.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108226043120397295429/reviews
Audrey Tan,5,"My second time back without the alcohol free flow this time round so could really appreciate the food this time. Had the maguro yukke meshi (minced tuna with runny egg) whilst my friend had the hokkai meshi (assorted seafood sashimi). All sets came with chicken karaage, chawanmushi, miso soup and orange slices. Really good and satisfying!

We shared the grilled tuna collar (kamayaki) which was done really nicely and paired with grated radish and soy.

Highly recommend for casual lunch or dinner. Seats are a bit close to each other so if you happen to have a loud neighbour, it can be a bit hard to focus on your meal.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100537510928931715089/reviews
