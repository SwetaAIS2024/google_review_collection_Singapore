WHY Quinn,4,"Directions - Right side of level 1 lifts. I started from the left and had to walk 1 round lol

Environment - Small but cosy when seated indoors. There are seats outside the eatery too but I preferred sitting inside. They even played my favorite jpop girl group song... Speed!! Feels like I've transported back to the late 90s early 20s before kpop started trending (in a feel-good manner no less).

Ordered - At the recommendation of the lady boss - Herbal chicken koka noodles and iced coffee latte (50% sugar level).

Not overly herbal and not too salty either. The chicken thigh was like m&ms, melted right off my mouth. The softbones could be eaten as well. The carrots infused with the broth was nice. Overall a comfort food dish worth recommending.

Latte was a surprise find actually. Not too strong but good enough to get some kick out of it.

Overall verdict - Will definitely drop by again if I'm around for decent comfort food at quite affordable prices.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109654108843072643671/reviews
Sean Poon,4,"Coffee is good, price is reasonable. The couple owner is very polite and friendly. The toasties is so on point, I like the ham and cheese when it is served when freshly toasted. The wide range of hot and cold beverages menu would excite you with no procastination on decision making. The main food menu would be limited, and seating is limited, too, so avoid busy hours like lunchtime. I usually park at City Gate and walk over for coffee.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104302598059978578735/reviews
Leau Russell,5,"Herbal chicken soup was so thick, so good. The chicken was so tender and soft and flavourful. Definitely did not skim on the ingredients when preparing the soup. Would recommend coming!!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108040806274882419816/reviews
YY,4,"Recommended here by Hongisbored and thought the food was pretty decent!

üçó herbal chicken certainly had that light herbal taste, and has ample of chicken meat to go with the noodles too

üêü fish soup was okay, think the garlic helped with things in general

Prices are fairly steep imo, other than the herbal chicken and fish soup. Drinks were $4 on average which I thought could deter the crowd in this area, thought some old school kopi and tea would help draw some folk here.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
LP Pua,5,"Visited this stall after seeing good reviews on a YouTube video and ordered the recommended Herbal Chicken and Fish Soup. The Herbal Chicken had a light herbal taste and wasn‚Äôt as outstanding as I had expected. However, the Fish Soup was on another level‚Äî the soup was superb, and the fish slices were thick and fresh. Coffee was normal. Overall, I‚Äôd give this about 4.5 stars.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
