      "text": "Alright, this is by far the best and the most aromatic chicken rice I’ve had in Singapore. Chicken is a bit bland but it’s tender and well balanced with the aromatic rice. It’s just so good I had to buy one more to take home. Staffs are so nice and polite. Kopi is standard, but I don’t mind. I LOVE THE CHICKEN RICE SO MUCH!",

Relatively cheap, a meal for 1 would cost abt $10 with chicken rice set with vegetables & drink. There are also western options apart from chicken rice. Friendly service rendered by the female supervisor. Good chili and the rice is not too heavy.",

The staff members are always friendly and the place is clean and well maintained. The staff chopping the chicken seems to be knowledgeable about hygiene when preparing the food.",

She explained nicely to me that Veggie condition is due to Pasir Panjang Veggie center. They have limited stock and delay of the delivery. Hence, they served this veggie.\n\nThey refund me SGD1 since I put back the veggie to \"return tray\" area as I notice it is not fresh at all.\n\nMoral of story: a simple gesture (telling the true) will secure the customer.\n\nSumarry: foods are not bad.",
