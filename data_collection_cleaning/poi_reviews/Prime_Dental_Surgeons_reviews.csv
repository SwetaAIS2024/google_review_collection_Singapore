Keong Yi Ling,1,Had a terrible experience in this clinic. I have a regular dentist for my routine cleaning every year but went to this clinic to try because it is covered by my company's benefit card. It was horrible. They finished the procedure in less than 10 minutes! It was an 'anyhow' cleaning like they can't be bothered and the doctor was in a rush to complete it. It was painful at some time too. Never going back to this clinic again. Terrible service rendered!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114528053361083529185/reviews
Diana Say,5,"I was recently attended to by Dr Lai to have cosmetic dentistry (ceramic veneer) done to my lower teeth.

Dr Lai has taken much care and attention to have the work aligned, and take time to explain each process she is doing.

I am very impressed with the finished, and would highly recommend any one needing a good dental clinic to visit Prime Dental Surgeons.
Their nurse, Juliana is also very friendly and helpful.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115589730639146599792/reviews
Simin Quek,1,"Not a pleasant experience. Not recommended.
Before going on with the service, already confirm with a price. End up another. Go at your risk, prefered Q&M just that no slot fully booked. But well. Last min thing. I was told that i need to pay certain percentage & i agreed.
The counter lady told me an amount. Afterward the session end another amount. It alright though.... just not standard.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103375395142869476857/reviews

LMY,5,"First visit here for teeth scaling and polishing, doc was fast and efficient and I didn't experience any pain. Payment via PayNow, Nets. Just book an appointment if you don't want to wait.
