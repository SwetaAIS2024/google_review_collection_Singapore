But display showed deal till 4 January. Nearly got scammed since deal was not honoured and I nearly had to pay full price. Shop with caution.",

      "text": "Today 22 Jul at about 10:45am, went over to Unity Pharmacy - Yew Tee Point, to purchase a Pack of Adult Diapers for my family member (PWD). At the Paying Counter, I was asked needed a Plastic Bag, \"Yes\" as it is a PWD Item, and my Bag was filled with Lunch items. The Lady Staff said it will be 5 cents. So, I replied that a week ago, I purchased similar item, the Plastic Bag was not charged, as I told the Staff the same reason then.\nAt this juncture, the Staff mentioned that \"no need to pay\", and I continued that people purchasing such needy items as this should not be charged. The Staff said it's ok, and that She will pay. I responded, \"Madam, I didn't beg you to pay, so I will pay\".\nThere was another Lady Staff (wearing Black) looked on, I told her is it wrong to express opinion? No answer, just a blank stare! It was a non-defining moment with a Unity Pharmacy Staff in Yew Tee Point, who didn't understand the deeper matter. To add-on, Unity Pharmacy Staff at Yew Tee lacks customer services and sort of \"tells\" of to customers opinions without thinking the implications on UNITY's image under NTUC. By and large, Staff at Lot 1 and Hillion are more customer oriented, listens and help where possible. I also wish to point out that to UNITY (and NTUC) to consider a concession for those buying such PWD Items if they require a carrier to conceal especially in a Bus or MRT.  UNITY (or NTUC) could absorb the 5 cents for them for list of identified PWD items. Or it could be those with Blue CHAS Card or even absorb under the NUTC Card. You can limit to one Plastic Bag, for more it is payable. You may wish to consider.",
