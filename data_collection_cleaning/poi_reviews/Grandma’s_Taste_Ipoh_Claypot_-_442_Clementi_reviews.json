      "text": "Found a tasty Malaysia style claypot dish here. Tried their green mustard, prawn, pork and tofu. The portion is good, and the price is acceptable. Taste is good, especially the green mustard, although I prefer it to be less spicy and more sour. The prawn claypot comes with 5 bigprawnsn but soup a bit bland, but still acceptable. The shabu pork is the best among the dishes. All below $10 per  claypot. Will try again if nearby next time.",

Actually we were looking for another claypot place with Michelin but it was closed at that time. In the end we were so happy with the food here in grandma’s, probably the other place wouldn’t be any better than this.",

Biss gave us a complimentary bowl of cool cut cucumber salad which was refreshing...thank you!\n\nDefinitely value for your buck with quality taste. We love the meatballs by the way...our 3rd time ordering it.",
