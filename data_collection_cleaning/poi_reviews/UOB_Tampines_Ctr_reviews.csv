Steffi Caroline,5,"Visited this UOB Centre and, as always, had a pleasant experience. During afternoon visit around 3pm, was particularly impressed with the friendly and dedicated staff at the registration and queuing counter. They went above and beyond to ensure that the queuing process was smooth and efficient. The staff even helped with setting things up on mobile devices, saving me a significant amount of time.

Their attention to detail was commendable—they didn’t just stop at queuing assistance but also made sure to guide me seamlessly to the relevant counter cubicle. They communicated effectively with their next colleagues handling my specific inquiry, ensuring everything was handled efficiently and professionally. Thank you.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106211704870175968579/reviews
