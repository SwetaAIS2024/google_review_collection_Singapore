When u put both chee cheong fun and porridge together, is match made in heaven. Tanglin halt hawker was a very popular place back in the 80's. Worth the try.",

Their menu has Chee Cheong Fun and porridge combos, which look really good and are very affordable. We ordered 2 types of Chee Cheong Fun to try and enjoyed them both. I would recommend the Fresh Prawn Chee Cheong Fun.",
