Jessie Soh,5,"Conveniently located underneath my block, I didn’t think much of a neighbourhood clinic.
After my first visit, I was pleasantly surprised at the professional level of the care team.
Dr Ong is a detailed and knowledgeable doctor.
He cares and gives sound advice to patients especially the elderly.
The assistants at the reception are helpful and kind.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106527597800395048990/reviews
