Muhammad Iskandar,1,"Avoid at all cost! Please lets make this hawker store close down because they give all Singaporean hawkers a bad reputation.

Portions are so small its pathetic for the price.

Beef Fried Rice ($8)
- No beef slices at all. Just rice and egg.
- Meant for 2 people. But the entire box can only have 5 tablespoons.

Oyster Kailan ($8)
- Not even a 1/5th of the container filled. Looks like leftover food.

Gung Gung ($12)
- $12 for twelve pieces. Wow....more expensive than a five star seafood restaurant.

I have grown up eating at lagoon for more than 30 years. This store needs to shut. Avoid please.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108360252583158566788/reviews
Minh Phung,2,"We order the sambal stingray and sambal petai from them. The portions were small and the stingray was still raw and we had to get them to recooked it. The petai was fine but nothing to write home about. I would not recommend this store, there are many other stores nearby selling the same things.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102444597524821556496/reviews
Celine C,5,"Actually thought the sambal stingray was delicious. Unusually fresh and fruity chilli which worked well on a hot day. Price is slightly higher than the other stalls, but at least it tasted good.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114061057958676879707/reviews
Kevin,1,Rude staff. Terrible stingray and expensive. This tiny piece cost $15. And it didnâ€™t taste like it was barbecued. Just a bland piece of skate wings slathered with mediocre Sambal.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112679266451373224764/reviews
Ian Goh,1,Food was very meh. Still edible but better to try other alternatives in east coast lagoon. Stall owner gave some kind of unhappy attitude while serving so it was kind of off putting. Wouldnt trust the recent barrage of 5 star reviews as its not the best zi char stall ive tried. It doesnt even beat average stingrays ive tried.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115205413916306988415/reviews
