Rashi Garg,5,"Contrary to other opinions, I find this school exceptional. Choosing a preschool for your child is a significant decision for parents, and I'm delighted with my selection. My daughter has grown academically and behaviorally, learning things I couldn't have taught her elsewhere. This is largely due to the excellent teacher-to-student ratio, ensuring she receives ample personal attention. I feel reassured knowing she's in capable hands. It's common for people to share negative experiences more often than positive ones, but in this case, I'm more than pleased to highlight our positive experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118319663222575313011/reviews
James Ong,1,"Please RECONSIDER sending your neurodivergent & neurotypical kids in all 7 ZEE group preschool. These are the reasons why;

1. The entire outlook of all the centres looks poorly maintained, the walls are old and mouldy, the toys in the centres are limited, the outdoor playground looks dilapidated.

2. Even though the teacher to student ratio is low.. I was able to noticed that the Teachers struggled to teach the class as there were MORE neurodivergent students compared to neurotypical and it was difficult to manage the class.

Avoid at all cost!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104548413679377913674/reviews
Katherina Mary,1,"After subsidy school fees is still very high. Releasing my daughter to cps who have no authority from anybody. How can anybody trust the teachers with their children who do not follow their school rules and regulations. ""Not to release the children to any other people other than the parents or to whom the parents gave authority to pick up"" so unprofessional of the teachers to just release my daughter like that.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114831942130865111926/reviews
