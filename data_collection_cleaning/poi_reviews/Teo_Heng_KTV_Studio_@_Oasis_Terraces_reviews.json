      "text": "Great place for small family to have a singing session! Very convenient for us staying around Oasis Terraces. We booked a medium room for 3 which I think the room max can fit 4 people. They have another medium room has 6 sofa seats and small room with 2 seats. Sound system is good, songs are very update, especially K-POP. Can drink $1 and we brought our own food. The system let you finished the whole last song even times up. They open till 1am on weekdays and 2am on weekends.",

The room was superb – clean, tidy, and very well-maintained. What truly stood out, though, was the exceptional service. Every staff member was professional and attentive, but one female employee, in particular, made a lasting impression. She was incredibly friendly and patient, answering all my questions with a warm smile. Her helpfulness truly elevated the experience. I will definitely be coming back, especially for the 5-star service she provided!",

      "text": "New outlet so it's pretty clean. Sound system is better than the one at White Sands. However Teo Heng still has a LONG WAY to go when it comes to their song selections. There are many songs that you can't find in their list compared to the bigger karaokes like Have Fun and Cash studio. Then again I guess price plays a part as well!",

When we asked in Chinese he seems 不耐烦 like I am just clarifying why so pekcek. Ridiculous behaviour he said ‘刚才跟你讲了你听不到吗” basically like I already said can’t you hear?. We asked you nicely on whether you can say again but noooo we got a rude reply back.\nPlease rectify this problem as its a very unpleasant experience",
