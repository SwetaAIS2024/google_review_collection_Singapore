Felt like it was a little too watery but taste was decent. Cheeseburger and fries were well cooked. The pine nut tart had the right texture and was paired with light cream which wasn‚Äôt too sweet. Would recommend!",

We waited so long for the main course to come even there‚Äôs not much ppl in the restaurant. The food was totally not related with French food, just normal western food. With such price and expensive service charge, the waiter didn‚Äôt even willing to help us take a picture even we asked politely, I was so speechless. Around RM450 for two person with such quality, no kidding. üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è",
