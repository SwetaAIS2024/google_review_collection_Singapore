Forest BK,4,"Malcolm Park is situated near Stevens MRT Station. It's a short walk along Whitley Road from Stevens MRT. It is also next to Tanglin Community Club and CPIB Corruption Reporting & Heritage Centre.
The park has an exercise corner on the hill slope. Rest benches are strategically located around the park.
Unfortunately, there are no rain shelters, but otherwise a clean and pleasant green space.
Up the slope or climbing up the stairs lead to some beautiful Colonial Houses.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
