Aquarium, we were exhausted and decided to take the Sentosa Express.\nI was surprised to learn that we didn't have to pay anything to get out. One only pays to get it.\nWe enjoyed the free ride which was very clean and smooth riding.",

In fact the train is running on a thin concrete line with its Wheels attached on the sides of the concrete Lane. We can know this only once we watch it from under the MRT Lane. It has Got very few stops but it gives The travelers a very good experience.",
