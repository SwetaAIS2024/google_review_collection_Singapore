Mostly 90% is bone, some with the skin and the jelly jelly things or we call it the fats?\n\nWe order a big pot for 2 pax. When we can't find any meat. We order one small pot asking for more meat and told the guy that we don't eat the skin and fat. End up the small pot only have 2pcs of meat üòÖ\n\nShould have some meat for us who don't eat fats üòÖ\n\nNever recommend. Not worth it.",
