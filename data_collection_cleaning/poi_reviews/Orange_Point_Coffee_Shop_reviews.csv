Shan L,1,"The coffee shop is overpriced—Milo costs $3?! The service at the drink stall is consistently poor. They often mix up orders and refuse to correct their mistakes, telling us to just take what they gave, even when it’s clearly not what we ordered.

The one saving grace is the Chenghao Spinach Yong Tau Foo stall. The uncle there is generous with his portions and the food is genuinely good—I highly recommend it.

If I could give this coffee shop 0 stars, I would. But I’ll give +1 star just for the Yong Tau Foo uncle.

And if you bring other food in they will chase u out",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100243111135008980597/reviews

The Genesis Family,1,"Spinach soup is over rated, the queue is long because only one person cooking, not because it tasty. Make the wrong choice to go w the queue option, waited 20mins.

Cai fan not nice, the Thai chilli tofu tasted weird

Green curry can eat but its on the watery side.

They sell fresh coconut at $3.50 which is reasonable.

Only 2 stalls opening on weekends.

Gotta give 1 star because food is not nice here",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114071894759795666732/reviews
LP Pua,2,"Decent coffee shop for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. However, giving 2 stars to the drink stall as the coffee cup had a stain at the rim. Fortunately, I discovered it early and didn't drink from the stained side.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
