We felt like the embodiment of the saying \"you can't teach an old dog new tricks\".\n\nDuring our long stay in Singapore we booked a course of lessons with Vashi of the SingaGolf Academy. Vashi is extremely patient and his style worked very well for us. We have both learnt a lot and made good progress. Thanks Vashi!",

      "text": "I’ve got some past experience with golfing at the driving range, and took lessons with Chelliah to improve my swing and consistency.\n\nInitially, I’ve had trouble with setting up the first lesson. However, after that, it was a good experience. Schedule wise, Chelliah was very flexible, rates and fees were pretty reasonable in my opinion.\n\nLessons wise, it was mostly practice and information sharing, where Chelliah felt necessary. This worked for me as it helped me to understand how my posture affects my swing, and how it also affected the flight of the golf ball. Now, I am able to look out for some of these things when I practice at the driving range on my own.\n\nThanks Chelliah and SGA.",
