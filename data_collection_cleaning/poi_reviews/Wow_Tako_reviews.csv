Cresilia Ng,1,"Had multiple unpleasant experiences with the same young female staff that others have mentioned in their reviews. Even when the flavour I wanted was clearly still available, she tried to persuade me to mix flavours and even lectured me with, “Don’t ask so much, it’s already on discount.”

Honestly, I’d much rather spend my money elsewhere than be told how to spend it by someone with such a poor attitude. This isn’t free, and I’m certainly not a beggar—I’m a paying customer, not here for a lecture or bad service! Discount or not, no one deserves to be treated this way. Plenty of other outlets offer better food and far better service. This one’s officially off my list!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108183716688150998680/reviews

Eay,2,"The tokoyaki tasted floury, and more like a bread ball and not much food in it. I ordered 15 pieces and gave me heaps of sauce and toppings which is I'm happy about it. The sauce taste not too bad though but the tokoyaki itself doesn't taste like typical Japanese tokoyaki. Haven't finish all my 15 balls the 2 bites is just enough to put in the bin. The staff she is not too bad though,unfortunately the food are. They don't accept card, cash only.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118237528520076877990/reviews
