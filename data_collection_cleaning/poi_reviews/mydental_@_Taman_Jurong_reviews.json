      "text": "I am 34 and finally decided to get metal braces here which are reasonably priced. The anxiety and the life changing decision I've made was only possible because of the stellar services by the doctors and staff at mydental@TamanJurong. Dr. Gaya helped fixed my braces and  I feel like I am in safe hands with her. I am working on my care for it. Very friendly and their follow up regarding any form of dental treatment was refreshing to me.\n\nFemale friendly environment and males/family can feel very comfortable too. My doctor who did my scaling and polishing took great lengths and detail in the procedure giving me a clean slate before my braces. I am looking forward to my next appointment. As I live nearby, very handy for me to come visit them. Highly recommended!",
