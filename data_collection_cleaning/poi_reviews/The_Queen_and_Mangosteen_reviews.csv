Arlene Kho,5,"Service staff were primarily very young people who are likely part timers. I was so surprised by how hospitable and friendly they were. Young part timers are typically shy and does the bare minimum and thatâ€™s fineâ€¦ but the staff here were so bubbly, chatty and friendly. Definitely a huge plus point!

The shepherds pie was ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯. It was probably one of the best Iâ€™ve tried. The 3 little pig burger was really nice too! Fish and chips were a little disappointing but then again our standard for f&c is usually too high so itâ€™s actually not that bad.

Sticky date pudding was lovely too!

Was quite pricy definitely. 3 mains, 1 side, 1 dessert and 4 drinks amounted to $200. Portion was big so itâ€™s not too bad.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105451342142141252662/reviews
Sarah,5,"After three weeks of traveling in Asia, we were really craving some British food and a pint. We stumbled upon this pub by chance, and weâ€™re so glad we did! My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Guinness and had a delicious bacon butty. I went for the lychee salad, which I thought was a unique and amazing ideaâ€”the flavors worked together perfectly, and I was pleasantly surprised. We would definitely come back here again!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101464983089060342698/reviews
Andy Williams,4,"Come here for a family gathering.

Had ordered a few dishes and found them to be alright, but would like to suggest a few tweaks to the menu to be more British.

For one, the sausages were too salty as compared to the ones in the UK. Nonetheless, the accompying sauces were good.

Fish ans chips were on point. Though malt vinegar should be by default served with the dish. Again, the curry sauce was nice to go with it. Would be interesting if they served with mushy peas as compared to the salad.

The beef and Guinness pie was a hit , as well as the seafood pie.

The ploughman salad should have a mix of three cheeses, perhaps can give this a thought.

Nachos was not really British but it is a hit for the table.

One gripe: the service could be more attentive to offer to remove the old plates as compared to just standing behind and only moving when the manager told them to...

Vishal Shirsat,5,"A very good place to have a casual drink and food. We loved the atmosphere. It's conveniently located in the Vivocity mall and also has a waterfront. Plenty of place to sit and enjoy delicious western/ mexican food. Good beers to choose from and a nice, lively feel to the place. Would go again for a friend's hangout.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116744492848799178941/reviews
Gregory Athanasius,5,"Nestled within VivoCity, The Queen & Mangosteen offers a charming pub-like atmosphere perfect for unwinding with friends. I particularly enjoyed the rustic ambiance, the diverse drink selection, and the tasty bar bites. Their happy hour deals, available before 7 PM, make it an even more attractive option.

A special thanks to the friendly staff member who provided excellent recommendations. The service was both efficient and friendly.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101240389824842882822/reviews
