      "text": "As a turtle lover, I feel very sad for the plight of the red ear sliders (freshwater turtles) here. These are abandoned animals, irresponsible pet owners threw them into this water feature that has no flowing water or filter, most turtles are sick (respiratory infection and metabolic bone disease), respiratory infection is a disease that can spread to other turtles living in the same water.\n\nAlgae growth also too rapid, suggesting too high a nitrate level - too much turtle poo and pee, + leftover food (fed by visitors) also causes turtles to fall sick.\n\nBy the way, these are freshwater turtles NOT tortoises. Turtles are semi-aquatic, and needs to swallow in water. Tortoises are land-dwellers and cannot swim, and will drown. There are NO wild tortoises in SG.",
