Ella Chandra,5,"I absolutely love it here. I joined in 2015 and just being here has greatly impacted my life. The people here are just so loving and welcoming. You will feel right at home after a few minutes with the welcoming people in harbor light. There is a youth ministry called livewire where youths from 13-19 join in fellowship to have games and learn more about God. There is also a Saturday evening service and a Sunday morning service. For kids,  on Sunday mornings,  we have the Royal Rangers ministry where kids can learn skills like cycling and baking, and learn about god at the same time. If your interested please do drop by!:))",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112702332149782826685/reviews
