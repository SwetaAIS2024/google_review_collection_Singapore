Flying Molen,4,"I ordered the minced pork noodles (bak chor mee) ‚Äúplain‚Äù version (i.e. neither having any chilli nor tomato ketchup) and it tasted quite good. I liked how they mixed the oil (most likely lard), soy sauce, white pepper, and other condiments. The taste was quite balanced when I compared with other stalls I had the ‚Äúplain‚Äùbak chor mee before. The only thing that wasn‚Äôt really to my taste was the type of noodles that they used. I think it‚Äôs a bit sticky. It could be due to overcooked accidentally. For a simple dish at a neighbourhood hawker centre and the price is less than $5, I won‚Äôt ask for more üòÑ",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113209867782143825808/reviews
Simon Y,4,"Decent BCM at only $4. Noodle portion pretty big for its price but the ingredients miserable, some mushroom slices, spoonful of minced meats, one meatball & one fried wanton, that's it! They should consider 2-tier pricing for the big eaters.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110316451866688483932/reviews
Zhengyi Chng,5,"A perennial favourite. Heng Heng's BCM has been consistent over the years. Have a soft spot for their dry kway teow/bee hoon with their distinctive chilli. Unlike other stalls, the owners have resisted against price increases while maintaining similar portions.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109857126872170995944/reviews
