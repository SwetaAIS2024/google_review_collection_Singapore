C,4,"The Rail Corridor is a 24-kilometer green passage in Singapore that repurposes the former railway line connecting Kranji to Tanjong Pagar. This continuous trail offers a unique blend of history and nature, providing a serene escape from the city’s hustle and a glimpse into Singapore’s past transportation routes.  ￼

The segment stretching from Biopolis through Tanglin Halt is a short but very pleasant and shaded part of the Rail Corridor. This section is easily walkable and is frequented by office workers commuting between Biopolis at one-north and the Commonwealth estate.  Along this path, walkers can experience a blend of urban and natural landscapes, with the opportunity to explore nearby landmarks such as the Wessex Estate, known for its colonial-era black-and-white apartments, and the historic Tanglin Halt area, which has undergone significant redevelopment over the years.  ￼ ￼

Overall, I’d rate this experience a solid 4 out of 5. It’s a refreshing spot for a leisurely stroll or bike ride, especially for those looking to unwind amidst nature without straying far from the city. A tip for future visitors: consider starting your walk early in the morning to enjoy the cool air and quieter surroundings.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
