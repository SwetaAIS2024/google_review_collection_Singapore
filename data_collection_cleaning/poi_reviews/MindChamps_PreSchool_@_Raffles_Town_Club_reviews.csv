Sharon Liew,5,"Great to see the Champs confidently performing on stage and even taking up the responsibility of being emcees for the performances! Thanks to the teachers for organising and coming up with the choreography, as well as all the effort put into the practices and rehearsals. The Champs learnt a lot through this process, and shows that school is not all about the academic curriculum but also about having fun and showing a different side of them! Looking forward to 2025 year end concert!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115924468805004307819/reviews
Jeffrey Teo,5,"Caring, passionate and nurturing. These are the things that immediately spring to mind when we think of Mindchamps RTC. In our time here, we have seen our daughters blossom into confident, well-mannered and inquisitive children. We have seen first hand how all teachers and staff are so passionate and nurturing about what they do and this has enabled an environment where our kids are able to excel and thrive in. It is no wonder that our daughters look forward to school every day and are always coming home with stories to share! The curriculum on offer is also impressive and we love how there is timely, effective communication between the school and parents. We are delighted to be part of the Mindchamps RTC family! Thank you!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102396226967362296368/reviews
lim yang zheng,5,"Acelyn joined Mindchamps in March last year. She was a prematured baby borned in week 27 and we wanted to ensure that she is placed in a preschool that will ensure her development. With the teachers guidance, Acelyn had grown well and inline with our expectations.

Mindchamps has all along been our preferred preschool due to their curriculum. In addition to the core subjects, they have music and gymnastics.

A big thank you to Teacher Kaori, Teacher Amanda, 丘老师, Teacher Daniel and Teacher Kavisha!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111749882516163196312/reviews

Emmanuel Heng,5,"The teachers here are of another level. They are activity planners, book curators, dance choreographers, logistics masters and trusted companions. Mindchamps should be the only consideration for parents only if finances are not an issue. However, for such a premium kindergarten, their tuition fees are very reasonable.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101835113964441831668/reviews
