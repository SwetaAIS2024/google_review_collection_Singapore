aiza,5,"Had a great experience at Bob‚Äôs Grill and Bar. The staff were excellent, friendly, attentive, and made us feel very welcome. The food was equally impressive, packed with flavour and well presented.

That said, the prices were on the higher side, which caught us a little off guard. Still, for the quality of service and food, it was an enjoyable treat. Just be ready for the bill!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104567648026229125911/reviews

Lynn Kiyomi,5,"A good and filling experience! The salt Bae part was entertaining and the last part of his performance was a surprise. Will post a Tik Tok video of it soon.

We were en route back from X-Park and I had checked the reviews of eateries along the way. Decided to give this place a try due to the good reviews and Wagyu beef flank 2hr buffet.

Wagyu beef flank was tasty and tender enough, though cooked more to medium well. Chicken was fall off the bone tender, broccoli was nicely charred and aromatic, mushroom soup and fries not bad, but garlic bread was not crisp nor garlicky buttery enough.

We had 4 rounds of the beef, including the first round. The 2nd round took some time coming and we had to ask thrice for the 3rd round, while the 4th round was quite prompt.

Music is nice, but too loud.
