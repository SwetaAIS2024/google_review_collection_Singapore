There were only two people waiting in the clinic, yet I still had to wait for a long time.\n\nWhen it came to my blood test, they couldn’t find a vein on either arm. Eventually, I suggested drawing blood from the back of my hand. However, the needle was inserted too deeply, causing no blood to flow initially. They had to move the needle around before the blood finally came out.\n\nI’m someone who isn’t afraid of needles, but I wonder how those who are scared of needles would cope in such a situation.",
