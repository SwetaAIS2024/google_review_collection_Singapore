He is full of energy and encouragement, and is great at motivating young children to learn and have fun. I also appreciate how Teacher Derrick is particular about the details so that the child builds a good foundation in drumming. My daughter enjoys her classes very much - itâ€™s such a joy to see her jamming with Teacher Derrick.",

They really enjoy the lessons and the teachers are always friendly and accommodating to requests for schedule changes or simply to allow the children to have a more comfortable experience. I am glad my boys have picked up new skills and honed them with Rocktone!",

My kid is moving steadily towards her dream of becoming a drummer and I love to jam with her on the guitar occasionally that Derrick helps to facilitate in the lovely colourful studio. One day, I hope to play in her band, thanks to Rocktone ðŸ™‚",
