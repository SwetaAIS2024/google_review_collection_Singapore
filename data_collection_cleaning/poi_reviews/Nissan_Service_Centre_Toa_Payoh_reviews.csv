Wei Han Ong,1,Just completed my 5k servicing. Send in my car at 11am and at 3pm it was still waiting to be washed. Customer service person could not answer me if the car was held up at servicing side or long queue for washing. Wanted to feedback to management regarding the long wait for a 5k servicing but was told to wait for someone to speak to me. Left the place without giving any feedback as I could not wait anymore. This place really need to improve in it's service standards and look into how to reduce its waiting time for car servicing.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106710575153383492590/reviews
Sean Eng,1,Extremely hard company to be able to get a good quality service. Attitudes need to be checked and their working environment needs improvement. Teamwork is lacking in many aspects,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104971667023288473087/reviews
HD,4,"Quite a long wait due to lack of manpower on 26 Dec (perhaps year-end staff clearing leaves) despite having an appointment. My appointment time was 9am but was only served around 9.45am. Would have given a lower rate if not for one of the staff's (Kumar) professionalism. He was very patient even though I requested for my car to be left at the service centre as I had to rush off for another appointment. Thanks for your service, Kumar!

Just my 2 cents: Perhaps the centre should not take in too many appointments if they are lack of manpower. This will affect the overall service rating as customer wait times are longer.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114624122088528858870/reviews
N Low,1,"Had a faulty aircon on my 2018 Nissan Qashqai. This service centre took 3.5 hours to “diagnose” the issue, claimed that many parts (compressor, condenser, cooling coil, cooling coil sensor) need to be replaced and quoted $3,400 + 2 days to repair. The attitude by the “technical officer” was condescending and unhelpful. They also said that they are understaffed - apparently only 3 mechanics to work on 30 cars upstairs.

I went to a different workshop which took less than 2 hours to pinpoint the issue (a jammed compressor) and replace the compressor which solved the problem for $708.50.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104013960022734186968/reviews
JACK LIM,3,"Reason Rating 3 Star , I would say overall experience for the first experience was alright.
Way disappointing it’s their after service washing service is bad. Perhaps they can improve in this parts. Even so is a compliment washing after servicing but didn’t do a good job, their skill honestly is worst then those petrol station skill.

I was attended by Kumar Sales man, with his clear explanation and time allowance toward customer expectations is good. Trying his best to speed up and clear the process. My car is new, so far don’t give me any problem yet.

Hopefully they can improve their after sales service for washing part",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114188647801507949873/reviews
