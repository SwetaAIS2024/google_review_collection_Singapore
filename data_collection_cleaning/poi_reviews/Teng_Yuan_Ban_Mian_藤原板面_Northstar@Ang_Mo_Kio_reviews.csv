Sam Wong,5,"Tried their homemade mee hoon kueh ($4.50) with an onsen egg ($1). Mee hoon kueh is thin and extremely springy. The soup base is less salty, naturally sweet and light. Every component works well together and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Overall 9.5/10.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115694236480258826587/reviews
