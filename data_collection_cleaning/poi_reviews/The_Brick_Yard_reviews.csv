Pauline Wee,5,"Tried The Brickyard for the first time on GrabFood, and it did not disappoint! The packaging was neat and secure, keeping everything fresh. But let’s talk about that darker chili—OMG, it was the real deal! Super spicy with a great kick, One of the best food deliveries I’ve had! You can really tell they cook with heart, from the flavors to the thoughtful packaging. The food comes in a keep-warm bag, keeping everything fresh and hot, and even the utensils are nicely packed—feels premium! The food itself was absolutely delicious, and I truly appreciate the extra black chili—it’s my favorite! Damn shiok! Will definitely order again. Highly recommended!

Definitely ordering again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113442208195765868656/reviews
