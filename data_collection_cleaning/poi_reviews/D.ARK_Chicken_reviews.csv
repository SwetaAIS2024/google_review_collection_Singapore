예신,5,"Chili chicken is by far the best in jojoba. Korean flavor. Crispy and soft inside, spicy and sweet sauce. I'll definitely be back.

The delicious chicken taste I had in Korea. Chicken gangjeong is the best. It's crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and the sauce is so delicious. If you want to eat chicken, this is definitely the place. Highly recommended!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101422113335946985465/reviews
