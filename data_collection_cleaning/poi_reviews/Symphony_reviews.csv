Kai Xuan Lee,4,"The wanton noodles had no wonton, just char siu, but the noodles themselves were really good. However, the soup was bland. Overall, it's acceptable and cheap food ($4) that you can find in a community.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111021202743722656292/reviews
Daniel Teo,3,"Surprised by the high ratings. Decent portion of noodles with texture thicker than mee kia but doesn't qualify as the typical thinner, springy wonton noodles. Char siew a little dry. Would have preferred thicker, dark toasted tender char siew. Sauce again was in between fishball noodles and wonton sauce. Lack a fragrant sesame scent or taste. Soup base very blend and lack flavour. Wonton itself was good though. I've had better wonton noodles in gombak area and even bukit batok east ave 4. My faves would be ones in telok blanglah drive, chomp chomp serangoon gardens and tampines west..",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104412565290870618429/reviews
MNG,4,"One of the longest surviving tenants in Sunshine place.

This shop sells only wanton noodle and they have built a loyal following.

Its noodle is egg version and cooked Al dente.

Char Siew is lean which a disappointment while its wanton is excellent. Good amount of pork and chestnut.

Its pricing is very attractive and offers great CP proposition.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
Kwong Hong,3,"Visited on a weekend morning, stall had a few customers. The stall itself is pretty small, 2 seats within and 3 tables outside.

Order the standard wanton mee ($3.80). Came with a decent amount of noodles, around 7 pieces of lean char Siew and 3 boiled wantons.

Noodles:
Noodles were drenched in a watery chilli sauce blend and probably some soy based sauce.

The noodles were the thicker kind which gives you a better bite. My issue with the noodles is that it had a very strong alkaline taste, which wasn't covered by the sauce and green chilli taste.

Wanton/Char Siew:
Wanton skins were thick and felt pretty dense. Skin was not the silky soft kind that floats on the soup. Rather felt like those 中国水饺 kind, definitely a miss for me. Meat amount was alright but I didn't really like the taste of the meat.

Char Siew is the standard lean meat 'cardboard' kind. But they did give a generous amount for a $3.80 portion. Not too thin.

Overall, slightly below average for me. Noodles and wantons could be better. But guess it is a somewhat decent food option around this area since there is almost nothing to eat at sunshine place.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101809393470427583015/reviews
Wen Ting Teo,2,"This is quite a disappointing Char Siew Noodles from the shop.

The owners told me there's no more wanton and only Char Siew Noodles left. I went to search on Google, seems like the quantity of Char Siew is similar to Wanton Noodles without wanton. However, they still dare to charge consumers $4 per packet and tell me the char siew is already a lot. I am very disappointed as I used to be a regular.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101323275704248736579/reviews
