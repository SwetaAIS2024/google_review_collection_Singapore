Mabel Zhang,5,"Did not know what to expect as the restaurant was new, but the food was so good. We ordered a vegetable biryani, butter chicken and garlic naan with drinks to share for two people. Only photos I have is of one of the pieces of garlic naan and our finished meal unfortunately. Looking forward to returning for future meals!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101209790203729013622/reviews
