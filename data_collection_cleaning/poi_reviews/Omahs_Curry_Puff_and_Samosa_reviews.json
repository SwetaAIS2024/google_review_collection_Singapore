I ordered fish fillet nasi lemak but was surprised to be given free chicken too without any additional cost. I told that I would definitely come back here again for lunch.",

Coupled with their fluffy coconut infused rice, egg and crunch anchovies, their Nasi Lemak is one of the delicious I have ever tasted. Their Nasi Lemak set is priced at $3.00 each, which is very affordable and is a deal that you shouldn't miss.",
