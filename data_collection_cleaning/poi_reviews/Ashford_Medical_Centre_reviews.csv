Wan Ilhan,5,"My mother booked a 10:30am appointment with Ashford. I was unwell with three episodes of vomitting, multiple episodes of diarrhoea and prolonged phlegm.

Upon arriving, I checked in with the lovely receptionist and within 10 minutes, I was able to speak with Doctor Nam. I told him about my condition and my Urea-Breath Test I have on the 14th of May 2025 for my underlying gastric issues. He explained thoroughly of what the cause(s) may be. Afterwards, he prescribed medication and assured me that it will not affect the UBT.

After the appointment, I collected my medication and requested the receptionist for a hardcopy medical certificate as my school requires it. The receptionist also answered my questions about which medication I should take when I get home, putting a star next to the one for my diarrhoea. Within an hour, I was able to go to the clinic from my house and back.

I would like to thank Doctor Nam and his team for getting me back on my feet by that same Friday. I am very grateful for the excellent service and effective medication given to me. In the future, I hope to go to Ashford again when I fall ill. Highly recommended ❤️
