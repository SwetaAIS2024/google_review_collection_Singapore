The two folks at the store were also friendly, polite, and attentive, which was another bonus. Overall, it is a place i will still come by to have minced meat noodles when I am around the place. Probably try out the signature one with abalone, too.",

Two meat ball, one 5 spice stick , 2 slice of mock abalones, mince meat and an onsen egg. That's about it. Got there before 6pm , ran out of chop chili. Nothing outstanding but quite lack of motivation to operate.",

      "text": "Their menu looked interesting hence I ordered their bar chor mee, mazesoba and meatball soup.\n\nBar chor mee: noodles were overcooked, to the extent it‚Äôs a little soggy, not what you want for a meepok dry dish. Taste was ok. A solid 3/5 for this.\n\nMazesoba: For a delivery/takeaway, chef didn‚Äôt consider how dry it would become, making it hard to mix everything together, I had to improvise by adding soup from the meatball soup. It was weird in taste as the soup I added wasn‚Äôt Japanese, but somehow it blended in well. Noodles were much better here compared to the meepok. Overall it was relatively tasty as well. 4/5\n\nMeatball soup: somewhat disappointing as I thought the meatballs would be larger, given what was shown on the grab app. They did mention that it was a generated image but still the disparity was totally misleading. However the meatballs tasted decent. 3/5\n\nOverall ok but I won‚Äôt go out of the way to eat this.",
