Sten (Piqued Wanderer),4,"Nice food that we had purchased.

We had purchased this and waited for more than 40mins just for the order. Not something that we should be facing but it is as per what we faced. Let's dive in yeah..

Food:
Nice and it's not the best from what we had eaten from others but hey, its a good effort yeah.. and we enjoyed it nonetheless..

Service:
Slow is something that we will describe. Many of the customers talk to each other and commented how slow it was just for their order. Cashier and dispatcher was also helping in the kitchen..

Atmosphere:
The koufu location is a great place to have your meals.. it is just that there is a need to focus on this stall due to the speed and cooking process .

All in all, we appreciate that there is a Korean/jap food here.. but we will appreciate it more if they can smile more and prep faster.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115011929186540431052/reviews
Eric Ckl,1,"Never even bother prioritise delivery order, why do business with rider/delivery? Only serve customer order while delivery order push aside and ignore after RECEIVING IT/ACCEPTING IT

Please turn off if cannot handle when youâ€™re short of staff (chef have to be cashier and working alone)

What a greedy business",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108247044402520130892/reviews
Tina Teo,1,"Staff is friendly but unfortunately that is all to it. The salmon/chicken and the sotong dish that we ordered, the salmon is sliced so thin and the chicken portion is small about the size of 2 chicken nuggets put together. The sotong portion is equally small and not fresh with mostly consist of onions. Totally not worth paying.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102326805807961380968/reviews
KiM BooN LeE,4,"Coffee shop environment but the foods are good... tried the $19.90 hotpot for 2 comes with 2 rice / noodle or could chose 1 each. U could buy 1 chicken wings for $2 with any meal purchase, normal is $5.50 (2) $10.50 (4) n $14 (6) n it really goods (only setback is chicken wings dont seem ""properly cooked, have some ""blood"" in it, not sure is it like that)... even thou the guy in the store not friendly and ""patience"", will still highly recommend to try here...",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104527916285751902034/reviews
HS,1,"Bought their food via Foodpanda and my bowl of soup was almost fully eaten. It clearly wasn't the food delivery rider as the bags were tightly sealed and every other item was untouched. Ridiculous standards.

Furthermore, the food that arrived tasted horrible. First and last time purchasing from here. Would give zero stars if I had the option.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112590913837509822877/reviews
