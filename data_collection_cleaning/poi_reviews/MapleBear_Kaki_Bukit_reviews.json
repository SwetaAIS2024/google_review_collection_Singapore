      "text": "So many things to love about this place. No need to jostle for parking space when dropping off the baby. The inside of the school is spacious and filled with educational toys and books. The ratio of teachers to infants (for infant care ) is great and teachers are wonderful and provide so many activities to keep babies engaged and learning. Despite our concerns, the principal and teachers reassured us that our baby would soon get used to the new faces and settle in. They keep us updated on his progress and sure enough he loves going there now.",

      "text": "I am very grateful to have the principal's and teachers' help and support because my child was crying when she went to school for the first time and felt strange. Now my child has settled into the new environment and she very enjoys going to school. Also, she has a lot of good friends now. I can see she has learned a lot of interesting things in school, like playing roles and cooking. We love their big tree inside the school, as the tree is filled with educational storybooks and toys. Besides this, the location is pretty good for us.",

He loved all the different activities in the day. It’s brand new so facilities for infants are very clean and of very good quality. I’ve seen many other infant care centers and this is the only one I can highly recommend. Thank you for taking such great care of my boy!",

His interest in books have grown, he is speaking well & showcasing some independent abilities like putting on his shoes, eating, doing potty, and many more. I strongly believe this is all the MBKK’s teachers continuous & consistent hardwork to cultivate good habits.",

      "text": "I only have pleasant things to say about MBKB! I sent my 3 year old there although it's not near where we stay because all the other schools in our area were full until 2023. I had not heard about Maple Bear prior to this but I am so happy I sent him there. The teachers are all so attentive and amazing. I brought up a concern on the Maple Bear app, and the teacher actually told me that she would give me a call to chat when the kids were having her nap. She also gave me some pointers on what we can do at home. I was so impressed as she had to give up a bit of her lunch time to have a chat with us.\n\nThe Directors and Principal have been second to none. The chain of communication has been very open between staff and parents.\n\nMy son has learnt so much through the activities that the teachers planned.\n\nThank you Maple Bear Kaki Bukit. You have been outstanding!",
