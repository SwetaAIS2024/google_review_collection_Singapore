Hob,5,"REVIEW: Historic.  This was the hub for Serangoon gardens in its heyday.  Before it was a car park lot, it was the bus interchange; just before it had shops in wooden shacks on its perimeter, which had moved from their location at the open longkang (storm drain) along Kensington Park Road.  I remember people criss-crossing the bus interchange- we had the ability to jaywalk safely (sic) back then! 😂
INGRESS, POKEMON GO: Oh, and for players: there are quite a number of pokestops and portals around the circus.  HINT:  then walk along Maju avenue... 😏 Get your gym gear ready... 😓",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111279973416572568370/reviews
HP NG (Astute33),5,"This may seem like a typical bus stop, but do take note that several bus that come to this stop can be going in different directions. For example, bus 73 can be going towards AMK or TPY. Check with the bus captain before tapping your card.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113606330326972330945/reviews
