I ended up waiting 1+ hour (friday morning which is not even peak hour) when i badly needed the pain meds. Clinic seems to have provision for maintaining a queue system, would recommend them to use the system for more transparency. If i ever visit again, it surely will not be without an appointment",

Firstly after I went in and said hi, i was abruptly asked ‚Äú your name‚Äù and the doctor‚Äôs tone was cold and dismissive throughout the consultation. His comments about my condition and my presence at work came across as judgmental and accusatory. No effort was made to establish personal connection, furthermore he ended the consultation with ‚ÄúGo home and do not spread the virus to others!‚Äù Anyway seriously concern the quality, professionalism this clinic group selecting their relief doctors given how disrespectful experience I have gone through. Suggest call first to avoid the suffer.",
