The slides had also signs not to walk the slope upwards.\n\nWHERE ARE THE PARENTS to properly instruct and supervise their kids what to do and what not?\n\nIn lack of that, Singapore is one kids attraction poorer.\n\nTo all the parents: Don’t ‘dump’ your kids to such places without supervising and instructing them. It’s not the Zoos responsibility.\nIt’s yours!\n\nSad.\n\n@Zoo Team: prices for ice cream, drinks and refreshments are exorbitant. That’s rip-off.",

What u see is what you get, no big wow....\n\nOpens at 0930H daily, do check if your day of visit happen to be maintennace day at their website. Waterplay may close due to foul weather.\n\nEither u walk up the 'hill' or take free shuttle from atation 1 to station 2.\n\nWashroom and Shower facility available on site. But bring your own shampoo and body wash.\n\nWatercooler and baby room available on site too.",

I was sorely unprepared for waterplay, and was saved by Sean, a staff from birds paradise who informed me that they do have diapers on hand within the first aid room, accessible via staff. Thank you staff!\n\nThere's also a quiet aircon room right next to the shower facilities for everyone. Really appreciate these touches.",
