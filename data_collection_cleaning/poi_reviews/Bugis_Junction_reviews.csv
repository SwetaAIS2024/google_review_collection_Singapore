Maheen habeeb,4,"Bugis Junction in Singapore is a lively shopping destination that blends modern retail with a touch of heritage charm. Unlike conventional malls, it features a mix of indoor shopping and open-air street-style stores, creating a unique atmosphere. The variety of shops caters to different tastes, from fashion and electronics to specialty stores",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102172810690478657026/reviews
Dresden PosÄ™t,5,"Passed by here, and it was a pleasurable experience being here, if you do not mind the usual packed crowd. There's a lot of shops here, multiple floors, and a few link bridges, depending on where you want to go. There's quite a lot of amenities here, so you can come with your family and friends. Overall, a great shopping experience in Bugis!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100555790826902422091/reviews

Fabian,4,"Original i didn't intend to give a review but since Google is asking it.

I like the vibe of this place. It is cosy, clean, and welcoming. The place is outdoors but has a glass roof. Its also fitted with air conditioning. So it was actually pleasant.

There were a number of shops here. It's a standard shopping area. What i like about this place is its close proximity and easy access to other places. Bugis Street, Victoria Street, Bugis + are all nearby.

Oh ya, we were tired of all the walking and rested here with ice cream from McDonald.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105050493329866631297/reviews
