Taizu,1,"Ordered Taro Milk Tea and added Handmade Mochi ($1.90), can't tell if I'm blind or my mochi escaped. I guess some bubble tea stores operates as a charity organisation too. üòÇ",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114447937586673582905/reviews
E TZJ,1,"Ordered Dong ding oolong, less ice, 25% sugar and  osmanthus jelly.
The drink itself tasted like plain water. Very very very subtle taste. Ice was definitely not ‚ÄòLess‚Äô, it‚Äôs more than half the cup!
So disappointing",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103108819699795808425/reviews
Ash Ash,1,"Wondering what's the craze about PlayMade. We tried first time today and it was disappointing. The Rockmelon Fresh Milk was weird. There was dessicated coconut in it. We tried to finish it but threw it half way. It was awful. Brown sugar milk tea was tasteless.
The self-order machine idea is bad. Customers taking too long to decide what to drink, making the queue unnecessary long and slow. Frustrating.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107476653421719668747/reviews
Jay S,5,"Newly opened outlet. 1 for 1 for their signature drinks from 17-19 Mar. Loved how they manage the snaking queue. Pre order on a piece of paper and fast collect. With a huge crowd, their drinks tasted superb! üëçüèª",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103783445153793643024/reviews
Kellie Sim,1,"have been a loyal supporter of playmade‚Äôs multiple outlets across sg. have come multiple times to this outlet before the closing time but was turned away because of an unstated and unspoken last order time that was not mentioned anywhere else. quite disappointing to make a visit down to the outlet only to be told this 15-20 min before the stated closing time on google maps/instagram. understand that they have a lot of grabfood orders and also that sometimes there might be people in front of us who order 4-5 drinks before our turn, but it would be nice if the last order time and closing time are differentiated more clearly. please note before coming!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102727374459859423161/reviews
