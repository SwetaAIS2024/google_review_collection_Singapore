Kia Guan Ng,3,"Limited food selection here as a few of the stalls are either closed down (at least 2, you can see the advertisement to rent out stall) or not operating (fish head steamboat) in the morning. The roasted duck is nice but not the noodles. Thereâ€™s an Indian Muslim stall, a roasted meat, rice and noodle stall and a mixed dishes rice stall. The coffee here is average but can be better. :)",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108972979221461010763/reviews
