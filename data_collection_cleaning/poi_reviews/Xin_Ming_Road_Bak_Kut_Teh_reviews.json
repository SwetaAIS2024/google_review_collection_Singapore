      "text": "Really good \"long gu\" Bak Kut Teh with strong taste of soup, meat that has the just right firmness and chewiness (don't forget to try their dragon's rib), with a juicy and VERY flavorful burst when you chew in.\n\nThe side dishes go well together and the veggies are not too salty, yet full of taste. They moved from their previous location (ex-Rong Cheng) to the Kola coffee shop. Have been eating regularly here for many years.\n\nThey also give wet tissues even though this is a coffee shop BKT. Coffee shop also has large air coolers blowing in so it isn't too hot.\n\nSoup is refillable.\n\nDon't forget to order the tea set especially if you're not eating alone! The Pek Sin Choon tea goes REALLY well with the BKT, and it is one of the few traditional coffee shop BKT that actually serves tea. Don't know why the other reviews don't seem to mention this, if you really want to complete your meal. This is the real traditional BKT, not some restaurant tiny inflation and adapted version missing flavor.",

      "text": "Finally trying them again after they‚Äôve moved over to its current location at Kola Food Centre. A little inaccessible if you aren‚Äôt traveling by car and unfamiliar with the area, but the food is totally worth the trip.\nDelicious flavorful soup that‚Äôs neither too peppery nor too bland.\nTender pork ribs that peel off easily, yet still fleshy enough and full of flavor to give the mouth the satisfaction of chewing into them.\nThe fritters were crispy and goes perfectly with the soup, and the braised peanuts were delicious!\nNot forgetting the soy sauce chili which is a great complement! It‚Äôs thick, salty, and if it isn‚Äôt spicy enough, a bite into one of the chili padi will do the trick!\nAt $22 for both of us, this is a very reasonable cost of $11 per pax. The portion is very generous given its cost (we each had 4-5 ribs!), and of course as with most bak kut teh stalls in Singapore, the soup is refillable ‚ù§Ô∏è\nDefinitely worth the trip back again, and its most value for money when you bring friends along to share the sides!

Soup taste like hot water with lots of pepper. That‚Äôs all. Very dilute without flavour. Not much meat in the ribs they gave. Lady boss tried to upsell a lot of her other side dishes.\n\nRegretted ordering from the stall. They should take down those newspaper cuttings.",

      "text": "Absolutely horrendous food and dishonest attitude from the old woman. Do not come here purposely to try their bak kut teh.The meat from the pork ribs were very hard like chewing on a cardboard. They also looked like they were oxidised and left at a corner for a long time. The soup was also not piping hot like other stalls; instead it tasted bland and too peppery like putting pepper over a bowl of hot water. The sauce in the braised pork was also tasteless and too salty.\n\nWhen I approached the old woman and asked her for an explanation as to why the pork ribs were as such, she only knew how to say \"Êàë‰ª¨ÁöÑËÇâÊòØËøôÊ†∑ÁöÑ„ÄÇ‚Äò‚Äô and rejected our request for a new bowl. From what she said, it was as if the pork ribs were of the finest quality. This is totally unacceptable.\n\nDo not come here to eat. It's an absolute waste of money and time.",
