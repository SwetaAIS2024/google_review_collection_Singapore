The veggies that come with it is very delicious though. I liked the pandan milk tea, very nice mix, providing some sweetness to the tea.\n\nThe kaya toast was quite good, very buttery, nicely melted, very creamy.",

      "text": "We dined there this morning, ordering the Toast platter and Curry chicken prata.  The food quality was acceptable, but significant improvements are needed across the board.\n\nOur order was mistakenly given to a later arrival who had ordered the same dish, resulting in a 20-minute delay.  The principle of first-come, first-served should be consistently implemented.\n\nObserving other customers receive their orders (even different dishes) while we waited was frustrating.\n\nThe service staff require additional training.\n\nMy wife's curry chicken arrived even later, after a 30-minute wait.\n\nNo apology or acknowledgement was offered for the significant delays.\n\nThe food was adequate, lacking any exceptional qualities.\n\nThe ambiance was unremarkable.\n\nHowever, the pricing was exorbitant.  Breakfast for two cost $25.\n\nWe recommend exploring alternative dining options in the area; we discovered a much more affordable establishment in a nearby building.\n\nWe enc ourage you to investigate other possibilities.",

The service poor as the food were not served together which led to my partner has to wait for almost 5 minutes before my toast was served so that we can have our meals together. The boiled eggs were served last and almost 15 mins later. And the restaurant was not even crowded.\n\nNeed to improve on service.",

Hope this brand continues to do well as there are not many brands that do local food well. Nowadays its all Chinese food and sadly the local players are going extinct",

      "text": "Took about 25 minutes for the French toast to arrive. The simplest version of french toast was with cinnamon sugar and costs $5.20. The cinnamon sugar was thickly applied and a little too strong for me. Would have preferred a plain version. But a plus point was the honey and butter slab given (see photo). Also, I ordered Teh O by mistake (via the app) and the waiter changed it back to Kopi O kosong. Good service. But I think the kitchen was understaffed and the toast came 25 min later. Luckily I was not in a hurry.",
