Shawn Ng,2,"Food extremely salty even with rice… you wonder why they have a huge drink fridge

烤鱼was food court standard with very little side dishes given, especially for 45 dollars..

Hotpot was just hotpot for 50$ as well. Spend your money else where

I asked for additional hot water to dilute soup but they poured more soup twice.

Chuan chuan decent though!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101978365299625662566/reviews
S Elan,5,"Fish was fresh and tender. We ordered additional pork which was cooked in the sauce. We loved the salted egg yolk buns, freshly fried and crispy. Packed with flavour. Skewers were nice too and adds a little variety to the fish.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103544649935674572451/reviews
Xiaohan Chen,1,"0 stars. Waited 45 minutes for our food when restaurant is 10% full, not even crowded, and the staff weren't apologetic at all. Only focused on fulfilling delivery orders and did not prioritize dine-in customers",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100973414117734535819/reviews
Wei Jian Tan,5,Brought my kids here after chinese lessons. Suan cai fish is suitable for the children. Fish was fresh and the dou miao zhi cha was nice. Great ambience and fast service!

Elisa Wong,5,Seabass we ordered was fresh and well grilled. Have been coming to cqgf since 10 years ago and glad this is one of the few that has kept up good standards both for their fish and zhi cha. Beer was unmatched too due to the 10 bottles for $38 only (3.8 per btl+),3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103670746376540900484/reviews
