TLC Is In The House,3,"Great outlet to get your booze from with a surprisingly impressive range of spirits.

It's an NTUC Finest with a bar and diner-like corner where a rowdy bunch of degenerates gather over the weekends. I tried out the ambiance for the hell of it at a wine-tasting event but I'm not gonna mince my words, there's a reason it's cheap.... It also feels and tastes cheap. But hey, it's clearly unpretentious and I'm sure that appeals to the ones who return.

Ambiance aside, the actual supermarket doesn't go beyond offering the basics probably because of space limitations. It's relatively small. On the upside, I got to taste-test a bubbly and a dry Rosé which I would never have bothered with ordinarily. The Promoter on duty was professional, chirpy and eloquent. Colour me surprised.

So there, drop by for an emergency supermarket run but it's certainly not a pub crawl spot for any self-respecting cocktail afficionado.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116246063219109577345/reviews
Will,1,"Supposed to close at 10pm.

Came a few times but they closed much earlier.

940pm and you are closed?
Not the first time.

For the times they are opened, the icecream freezer is way too cold, the whole tub at the bottom of the freezer is covered with ice. Maybe can look into it too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118119525043286062929/reviews
Yellow Bear,4,"Nice and big supermarket with a special aisle for the Alternative Lifestyle ( vegan, organic, GMO free etc ) with lots of plant-based options. Happy Shopping.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
Fun Kwok,5,"This is a really cool supermarket, which comes complete with a very good wine and alcohol selection, fresh produce, cheese selection, a nice deli, and guess what? A bar inside a grocery stall.

This supermarket took up the space which was the previous Cold Storage which was one of the anchor tenants of Centrepoint for decades. They changed up the concept of the supermarket and made it into a very good experience for shoppers. The fine selection of wines and cheeses is heart stopping and the Grocer Bar, which is a bar with good music and fine taps, is one of the amazing things of this supermarket.

That said, the foods available at this supermarket is of a high quality, with a good selection of organic produce, and the cashier staff are very friendly too. I do hope to come by to visit this supermarket again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102827686654539049214/reviews
CP,5,"This is probably the most swanky FairPrice store. And what is more delightful is that there is a drinks bar inside the store. This place offers a wide variety of wines, including those that are not available in the usual FairPrice stores. There is also a deli counter just beside that does simple roasting of any of the fresh meat. There is a small service fee of $5 for the wine and another $5 for the roast steak. It’s a very pleasant environment for a drink and bite and then do some shopping after that.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
