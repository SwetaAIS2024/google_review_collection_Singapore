Mason Tay,4,"Kopitiam – Changi Airport T3 (Post-Renovation)

There have been many new additions since Kopitiam reopened after renovations in April 2025. I don’t usually visit the airport often, so I’ll be updating my review as I try more dishes from the different stalls.

Korean & Japanese Stall – I went with the Saba fish, which was uniquely paired with sambal chilli. I was pleasantly surprised by how well our local sambal complemented the Saba—it was an unexpected but delicious twist. Loved it!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108195777674730720034/reviews

Food: 4
Service: 3
Atmosphere: 5

I remember the only food court we could find in Changi Airport was the one in the basement, mainly existed for the staff. It was like a hidden secret for those who wanted to grab an affordable meal before flying or selling kidney so that they wouldn't starve during the trip.

It's great now we have many food court for public, and T3 is not exception. They are located in the basement 2, it opens 24 hour! And the signage is clear, no longer some kind of insider secret anymore.

The price is around or slightly more expensive than regular food court. Food price has increased significantly in Singapore everywhere. There are plenty of seats and that is great, too. The choices are okay, I think if you are not picky, you can always find something to eat.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103975090698079167241/reviews
ML,3,"Newly renovated and newly reopened in early December 2024, so the environment is clean and refreshed. There’s many stalls but although it’s supposed to be opened 24 hours, when I was there only 3 stalls functioning. Maybe it was newly opened so not many stalls fully opened yet.
Tried to order something from  chicken rice stall but many options unavailable though the stall keeper was helpful.
In the end I had some Kaya bun and tea. Nothing really special but the price was affordable for the set. It’s below $4. So if you want a snack you can have this. A good place to take a rest in the late night in Changi Airport as there’s many seats and tables to use too.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106421457478618430542/reviews
Brian W.,1,"This is for the Claypot Rice & Herbal BKT store.

Rude counter girl. And I can easily throw tofu and some slices of beef in hot water with chilli oil. Worth $16.80? I'd much rather buy three bowls of ban mian and have them all in one sitting than go back to this store again. I mean, seriously? Singapore's Best Food my arse.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111466501427251333428/reviews
Sandra,5,"Just realised the food court was renovated; it seems bigger with more stalls. Yay, there's an Indian vegetarian restaurant in the food court. The set meal serving size is very big, guess that's why it's quite costly too. Hope there will be more vegetarian options available in the food court next time.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103115080435067308189/reviews
