YY,5,"Came by for a quick coffee stop after our lunch at Island Penang - which is under the same umbrella of companies.

Prices are okay, and the air conditioned environment is a welcoming addition especially in this hot weather.

‚òïÔ∏è coffee was decent, similar to the tea which we had as well

Fishballs were good, my father liked the curry üëçüèª

Definitely will be back for more coffee in future!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
Vincent Khoo,4,"Authentic Penang white curry mee. We ordered the sea food curry mee, chicken curry mee, chee chiong fun and hakka yong taufu. It is not as crowded as the sister shop a few units away. Curry chicken is authentic Penang taste. Worth coming back again if nearby.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845981260181580873/reviews
HT,4,"Clean and tidy place. Nice place to hide from the hot sun compared to a coffeeshop, while still having affordable coffeeshop prices. Good curry, it‚Äôs the thin-based kind instead of thick gravy. Not sure if the curry chicken with bread would have a thicker curry.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116385489983414228727/reviews
Chomeh Alex,5,"I  tried the nasi lemak and curry noodle from this stall, and it was an absolute delight. The dishes were packed with flavor and the ingredients were fresh and high-quality. The nasi lemak had the perfect balance of sweet and spicy, and the curry noodle was full of aromatic spices that made my taste buds dance.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116605339043090603769/reviews
Angela Lee,5,"Decent quality of food, good environment and very good service.

I asked for lesser rice for the nasi lemak hence the portion looks smaller.

Have tried the curry as well. If only the ""frozen"" taste can be cooked out. Otherwise for the price, there's not much to be unhappy about.

Fried chicken wings are good. For dessert, they have wheat dessert which is not commonly found. I usually get the aiyu jelly drink.

The lady serving me was polite and attentive.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110214808896206458338/reviews
