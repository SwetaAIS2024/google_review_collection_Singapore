Thenmozhi N,4,Lovely park though small. Quiet and peaceful especially in the mornings with lot of birds chirping; cute pets walking around. 300m track and 4 rounds > 1 KM covered easily ðŸ™‚,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101123268745172324233/reviews
S L,4,"This is the smaller cousin to the Bishan East Community Park. Itâ€™s less sheltered but has a Futsal court and a playground, which the said park does not have. Walking distance to the KPT kopitiam is another bonus for thirsty visitors!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111316266362121177513/reviews
Ant Tan (Ant),5,"Mini neighbourhood park for a quick jog or run. Approximately 300m for a round. Thereâ€™s playground, street soccer and bbq pits in the vicinity. Well maintained and greenery.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116001171041763971352/reviews
Ann L,4,The playground is well-designed with safe and yet somewhat challenging courses for the children. I believe it is suitable for 2 to 10 year olds. There is also more safe space surrounding the playground for older children to play other games. The exercise area for adults and elderly is sited near a community garden. There is ample parking spaces in the multi-storey carpark that is just a short walk away.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103657010349229508636/reviews
Lionel Tan,4,"A small park with a fun playground for the kids, although there is not much shelter for adults who may be waiting for the kids to finish their fun before heading home. A solution to this may be to join in the kids' games so it won't be so boring.

Since the playground is a ship theme, I had some fun pretending to be a shark trying to creep up on the kids.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111687787553725960008/reviews
