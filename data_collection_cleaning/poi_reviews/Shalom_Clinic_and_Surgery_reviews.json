      "text": "Dr. Soh is so amazing that I've been keep coming to him even tho my insurance not covered by his clinic and total commute takes me more than  hour. And by far the best doctor I've visited in Singapore.\n\nYou would definitely understand how professional and knowledgeable he is. Once you are in his room, you feel that his all  focus is only on you. And he always explain the process/problem calmly and as simple as possible then you just feel that you are in good hands.\n\nI never waited more than 10 minutes for consultation and his staff are nice and kind as well.\n\nI really appreciate Dr. Soh and would recommend to anyone with 100% trust.",

      "text": "Reception staff was gruff and unfriendly (no acknowledgement when I thanked her after the registration process or after collecting my medication). She took a long time to note down my drug allergies even after numerous repetitions.\nDr. Soh, made the right diagnosis. Yes, I have an outbreak of acne vulgaris, but I already knew that. He took 1 look at my face and said \"you have oily skin\" to which I had to correct him and said, I had applied a ceramide moisturiser, it did indeed have a shiny finish but in reality, I have dry skin. He was dismissive in his response and it showed in his body language as well.\nThe only positive is that I was in and out in 15 minutes. A lot faster than the time I would have spent at my regular GP. However, I did not get any sense of \"Shalom\" during my visit.",

      "text": "1 word for these people WOW. They let others cut queue just cos the patients visited them before. Your name/number is not called in sequence. I didn't know that is how you're supposed to treat people.üëèüèª\n\nAnd this is how they respond. From the name you know lah why they respond like that. When I came there was only 2 people outside & 3-4 inside. When someone came after me, they let her go in first. And I'm not talking about the old couple who went before me, because that is totally understandable. They also lied about only accepting cash payments after I asked again they were like oh why not you try to scan this QR code cos just now not working. Wth?? Not happy with your job don't take it out on sick people who come to see doctor because their sick, not see doctor for fun hor.",
