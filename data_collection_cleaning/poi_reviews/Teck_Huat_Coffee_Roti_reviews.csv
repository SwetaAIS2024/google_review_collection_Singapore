ImpeccablePat,1,"Met with a rude service attitude by their staff with long black hair tied in a ponytail. When I brought my own flask and told her to put the coffee in there, she raised her voice and asked me to repeat my order 3 times.
Even my mum asked me if it was the same lady with a bad temper.
The taste of the coffee is greatly influenced by the temperament of the one who pours the coffee. And my coffee tasted bitter this morning.
I hope that Teck Huat management will teach her anger management.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110247465241866788636/reviews
