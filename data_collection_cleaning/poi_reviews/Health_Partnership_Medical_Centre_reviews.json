Indeed the fee is higher - the pricing is listed at the reception but agree with the others that it beat you having to doc-hop and did not get your cough cured.\nJust a tip to call before visiting - the doc might be on leave.",

      "text": "Felt the need to leave a review here as the negative reviews doesnâ€™t do justice.\n\nIs funny how people went to see doctor for a â€˜cut / small scratchâ€™ & complained overpriced. Iâ€™m pretty sure the receptionist will prompt you about the consultation fee before registration.\n\nIâ€™ve been coughing really badly for over 4 months due to bronchitis. Went to different GP around my neighbourhood but the treatment just donâ€™t work for me.\n\nDrove all the way to this clinic after friendâ€™s recommendation, I must say Dr Cheong is the best doctor I ever met among all the GPs I went to. He is very detailed & even go all lengths to assessed your health records to see what other doctors prescribed you to make sure he prescribed the â€˜rightâ€™ meds which WORKS for you.\n\nWith his meds & jab, my bad cough instantly felt better (on the same day I visited him) no more sleepless night & recovered within a week?!!!! This really amazed me as NONE of the doctor can cure me this fast especially when I got bronchitis?!\n\nThough his pricing is steep, but I can assure that it is worth it rather than making multiple trips to affordable GPs but longer suffering.\nOne of the cons here is the meds shelf life is very short. other than that is all good!\n\nI highly recommend everyone to try this clinic If youâ€™re first time here.\n\nIâ€™ll definitely come back again, thank you Dr Cheong, youâ€™re amazing!",

      "text": "While I agree that Dr. Cheong is expensive, I must acknowledge that his medication and injection quality are top-notch. The treatment I received was effective and resolved my symptoms quickly.\n\nHowever, I found his bedside manner to be disappointing. He comes across as fatphobic, unempathic, and quite rude. Rather than offering support or understanding, he tends to attribute every health issue to weight, with a clear bias that overweight individuals are lazy, sitting at home, eating, and not making any efforts toward healthier habits. This kind of attitude is extremely off-putting and makes it difficult to feel comfortable or understood as a patient.\n\nIn summary, while his treatments are effective, his prejudiced and dismissive attitude leaves much to be desired in terms of patient care.",
