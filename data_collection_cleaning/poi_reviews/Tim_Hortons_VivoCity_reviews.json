      "text": "I ordered the grilled chicken pesto sandwich and the pistachio cream latte. The food was not it. The sour dough was too tough when I bit into it (not crispy). The  filling was average. As for the drink, I wouldn't call it pistachio cream latte if it's full of ice and the cream is barely there. I don't know why it was named pistachio because I couldn't even taste it. It was simple iced latte. I had heard so much about tim hortons and I was looking forward to it since it was my first time but this was a disappointment.",

Though if you want to taste and experience Tim Horton's Singapore, then, just go for it. Anyway, we ordered the tiramisu and carrot walnut cake plus some black coffee and latte. Their cakes are not really exceptional. Can find better & yummier cakes at other SG bakeshops.",

      "text": "Ordered Original Iced Capp with skimmed milk, and tried Yuzu Cream and Cinnamon Sugar Timbit.\nForgot to ask less sweet for my Original Iced Capp, tasted a bit too sweet for my liking, couldn’t taste the coffee itself.\nYuzu Cream Donut was nice, texture was soft and fluffy. Cinnamon timbits was just normal. Ambience is okay, quite hectic at coffee break time. Service was okay.\nNext visit: Ordered Mapple Cinnamon Latte with Skimmed Milk and Less Sweet, and tried their Tiramisu Mousse.\nThe Mapple Cinammon Latte was nice and lovely. It was enjoyable drink.\nBut unfortunately the Tiramisu was a disappointment. I’m a Tiramisu lover and this is not a tiramisu for me, it has no coffee taste or tiramisu flavour at all. Just sweet only. Just like you eat a sweet marscapone cream with chocolate powder on top, that’s it. Also the cake size is quite small, not worth the $8.50 price for 1 slice and some more no tiramisu taste.\nClassic Egg Croissant was not bad too, the croissant texture was flaky, but it’s a bit too buttery for my liking. The egg mayo filling was okay.",
