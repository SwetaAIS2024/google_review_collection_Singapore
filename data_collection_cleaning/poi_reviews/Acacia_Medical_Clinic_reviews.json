Apart from dispensing sound advice and spot-on diagnosis, he has been very dedicated in following up on our treatment progress. Thanks to his sharp observation and speedy referral to a specialist, we detected a tumour in one of our family members (recovered). His support staff team is also friendly and warm. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ",

But when ure sick and down in the dumps, you want at least some positive experience at the clinic. Here, ull get that. Dr Benjamin is one friendly and assuring doctor who cares for the patients he sees and doesnt rush. Once, he even saw our infant after a small freak accident, just when he was ABOUT TO LEAVE. Talk about dedication to the profession. I met many awesome doctors, he just joined the ranks and im truly grateful we found him. The staff are all so friendly, helpful and pretty much very kind.\n\nWhole team is just awesome.",

Call today to enquire about some medications but cannot get through since 6pm.\n\nManaged to get through at about 6.15pm but the phone was picked up and left aside as I could heard the conversations among the clinic staffs.\n\nWas trying to get their attention but couldnâ€™t do so. Was on hold for about 10 minutes trying to get their attention.\n\nApparently, it seems like they picked up the call and left the handset aside. They have no intention of picking up any calls.\n\nProbably this explains why till now I could not get through the line.\n\nThe phone line engaged since then.",
