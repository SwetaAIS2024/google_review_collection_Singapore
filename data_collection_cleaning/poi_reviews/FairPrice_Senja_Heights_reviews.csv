Joshua Chew,5,"Beautiful NTUC FairPrice that boosts a variety of essential items and food. There is a fresh seafood area, with poultry meats and even sushi which is hard to find in neighborhood Ntucs! You can definitely find more exotic items and the place is quite huge. The supermarket will definitely help the residents nearby. When checking out, the staff was really kind and friendly. Nice cozy FairPrice.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100928805220966571942/reviews
Nathaniel Chew,5,"Excited to have a new Fairprice in Senja, with ample space between rows and a good selection of produce. Bonuses include live stations for sushi, yakitori, roast meats, and even a mini polar cake & puff stand. If they add a bakery section with fresh loaves, it will be perfect.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106095696244067904216/reviews
