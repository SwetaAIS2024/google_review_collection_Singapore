Win Win,5,"Last month I had the opportunity to attend the open house at Playfacto Boon Keng and I loved what I saw. The event provided a comprehensive overview of the centre‚Äôs offerings, leaving me confident about enrolling my LO there. I am not one to write reviews but definitely check this student care out! Good things must share!!!

From the moment our family arrived, the atmosphere was welcoming! Everyone greeted us warmly and took the time to explain the centre‚Äôs programs and daily routines. Their passion for providing quality care and education can clearly be seen.

The facility itself is wonderful.  Classrooms are bright and spacious! I was especially impressed by how Joy did not hard sell her centre. She even suggested that we visit other centres and only sign up if we resonated with her. I am thoroughly impressed and look forward to seeing my LO flourish. Thanks, Joy and team!!! üëçüèª",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113148568338796284880/reviews
Suren Raj,5,"My child has been attending PlayFacto BK and I‚Äôve been really happy with the teachers there. They are kind, approachable, and seem to genuinely care about the kids. My child always comes home talking about how supportive they are, and it‚Äôs clear they put effort into understanding each child‚Äôs needs.

The teachers also communicate well with parents, keeping us informed about how our child is doing. It‚Äôs reassuring to know my child is in good hands in such a caring environment.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110098821802629911573/reviews
Jayne Tham,5,"Very spacious and bright. Centre Director Joy is very passionate about childhood education! She gave us a tour around the Centre and shared with us on how Playfacto is all about positive education. I would imagine this place to be very nurturing for my kids! Plus they offer enrichment like robotics, math so that parents don‚Äôt have to travel to and fro for classes!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103319322655752368962/reviews
Zames from Repair.‚Äåsg,5,"They are a spacious, clean, and very conducive student care centre run by a brilliant team of great people‚Äîthe kind I would want my kids around! They have a variety of optional enrichment classes from creative math to coding and robotics that the kids love so much. And they are located so conveniently in a new and modern building beside Boon Keng MRT station with ample and easy parking for those who drive. There is also a great cafe on the first floor, perfect for when I am early for pick up. 10/10 all around! ü§©",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111767097607633363801/reviews
CW Tan,5,I was relieved to find a quality and conducive ‚Äòafter school‚Äô student care centre in Boon Keng area after failing to secure a place for my daughter earlier in another centre located within her primary school. It was equally pleasing and assuring after having a 1-to-1 campus tour conducted by Ms Joy (Centre Head) last week. I look forward to hearing and sharing from my girl when she starts her ‚Äòafter school‚Äô life there :),a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115975694429308176200/reviews
