      "text": "Bought the 10 tics for $100 to support Cathay cinema and decided to use 2 tics today. Was told by counter staff that they cannot be used for 4 movies showing currently and one of them was the one I wanted to watch (The Sinners). I understand that the voucher tics have TCs (eg exclude Tamil movies) but these movies were newly added restrictions. Reason given for not being able to use the vouchers are they are due to distributorsâ€™ TC. The cinema is already showing so few movies (maybe 6-8), so ultimately not much choice at all. I hope Cathay will review this as it is not fair to impose these additional restrictions on the vouchers. Otherwise, there is really nothing much to watch and it will leave supporters disappointed with Cathay. Staff are very friendly though.",

Why?\nSuggestion: Using the QR code from online booking, patrons should be able to use that to go into the theatres. Save cost of printing papers. Reduce queues.\n\n2. DONT book seats at A row. Why?\nThe lights are very bright.\nSuggestion: Can dim the lights after 1/2 hour. Sitting there was so uncomfortable.\n\nSo to all other patrons, do take noteðŸ˜ƒ",
