Diana Sim,5,"Teacher Yogi’s approach to teaching phonics has been nothing short of exceptional. Her methods are not only engaging but also highly effective in helping my little one grasp the foundational elements of reading and writing.

Teacher Yogi also excels in creating a positive and encouraging classroom environment. She fosters a sense of curiosity and excitement about learning phonics, which is crucial for maintaining my little one’s interest and motivation. Her patience and genuine care for my little one’s progress is evident, and she takes the time to provide individual attention and support.

In addition to her in-class teaching, her communication with parents is consistent and informative, offering tips and activities that align with what is being taught in class.

Overall, Teacher Yogi’s phonics teaching is highly effective, engaging, and supportive. Thank You!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102017389371979656757/reviews
Zack Lim,5,"I highly recommend Kidz Literacy Cove for anyone looking to enhance their child's reading and English skills. My children attended this school since preschool and thanks to the dedicated efforts of Teacher Sarah, Teacher Jasmin, and Teacher Kieran, they have made remarkable progress in their reading abilities.

Teacher Sarah's enthusiasm and innovative teaching methods made learning phonics engaging and effective. Teacher Jasmin's patience and encouragement helped build my children's confidence in reading aloud. Teacher Kieran's attention to individual learning styles ensured that each child received personalized support.

The environment at Kids Literacy Cove is nurturing and supportive, and the teachers truly care about their students' progress. I am grateful for the positive impact they've had on my children's education. Thank you, Teacher Sarah, Teacher Jasmin, and Teacher Kieran, for your dedication and commitment!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103236380810667563048/reviews
Eileen Tan,5,"My boys have been with Teacher Sarah since they were little. The phonics programme is great as it is well executed by Teacher Sarah. We like it that she speaks proper English to the children and not Singlish like other schools. Klc is not only for young children as they also have an extensive programme for primary school kids. Even though my sons joined the group class, there was individual focus targeting on weaknesses. Would definitely recommend KLC to everyone!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100127289567405449807/reviews
