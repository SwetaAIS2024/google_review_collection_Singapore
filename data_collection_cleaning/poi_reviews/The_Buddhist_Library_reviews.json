So far... the support and experience has been great, no words can describe the experience and the great help rendered by Buddhist library.\nAlso many thanks for the great support and coordination by Mary. Without her great help, I guess I am still stuck...",

Suttas, commentaries and biographies from each of the traditions - Theravada Buddhism (the way of the Elders); Mahayana Buddhism (which speaks the language of its audience); and Tibetan Buddhism (which gets a bit esoteric) - can be found here. There are also books on quantum physics because Buddhism is about seeing the true nature of things.",
