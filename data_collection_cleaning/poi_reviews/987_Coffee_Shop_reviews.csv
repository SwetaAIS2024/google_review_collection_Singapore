DBSK,5,"Having dinner here after the badminton session nearby, they have seating open air style at the ally and u can order food from the stalls available in the coffee shop.
Drink we order Chinese tea at one dollar each turn out to be good.
Food, we ordered from zhu cha and 炒翻天 which is good, especially their 孜然羊肉 from 炒翻天. Really good. All I can say is a must try dish, but I think they only have it at limited period.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117677868418387031444/reviews

Ojisan “Hiroshi”,4,"烤鱼不错， $22.80 for that portion is pretty worth it. Fish used was batang, and it was fresh. Things to avoid if you want to add on I think are the lobster balls and sausage/hotdog and beef.

As previous reviews mentioned, people here are friendly, thus I had a good dinner and dining experience. Too bad 串串were sold out.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112623517876975514039/reviews
