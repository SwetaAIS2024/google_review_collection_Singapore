Few seating places inside and ample outside in the Lobby of the building.\nPrices are reasonable and service is quick enough. Muffins get sold out early in the day, but the rest of the things are generally available. Chiffons are definitely recommended in this place. They are light, not so sweet and fresh.\nA practical location for people working in the offices in Alexandra TechnoPark",
