Leonard Wee,5,"Nice man selling solo. Possibly the best Indian style soup kambing in Singapore. It's super spicy. I don't take spicy but I suffer 20mins to devour the whole bowl of lamb ribs.

The best!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116841518027778345489/reviews
Crystal,5,"This is just another add on review that the Sup Kambing is Very Delicious! Flavourful and will recommend to anyone who wants hot comfort soup. No one will regret the taste of this kambing soup. There is no 'bad' goat's smell from any part of the soup and it is thoroughly cooked so you can feel the essence of the tasteful soup run through when you swallow it. If cyclists wanna full meal before your journey home or to Changi Village, this will probably be one you can have. It lies at the far end corner of the hawker centre but it packs a good bowl of flavour! Enjoy!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103199255043060012721/reviews

Nur Diyana Md Nasir,5,"Bought a bowl of mutton soup from their stall for the first time today, and it was sooo good! Quickly went there again to buy two more packets to bring home. ðŸ˜„ Their original location is at Geylang Serai Market, but I'm really glad that they have opened another outlet at East Coast Lagoon Food Village!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108831633535190197352/reviews
