Rajeswari Pandi Rasan,1,"One of the school which have lots of bullying and rascim issues. My child is in Secondary 3 currently and with an existing medical condition. Even with doctors memo, the school always fail in following instructions. Doesn't remind the students or parents of an important exam coming up. Which end up the students to lose the marks and drop to NT level. And they also will not rectify their mistakes. Only give reasons. Please for your child's own future. Don't choose this school",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115477066429097469146/reviews
