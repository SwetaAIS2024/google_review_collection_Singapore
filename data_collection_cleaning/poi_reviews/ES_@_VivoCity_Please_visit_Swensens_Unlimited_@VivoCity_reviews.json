It not only waste the time for walk-in customers who might not know the rules, but also those of us who made the effort to do a pre-booking. Swensons, you can do much better than this!",

Got the salad bar with my tenderloin and was surprised that in addition to salad, there was a selection of sliced bread  (multi grain, sourdough), fruit, prawn crackers, cheese and soup.\n\nFinished off with the quintessential banana split and a single scoop of durian ice cream. Swensens ice creams are the best! Service however was rather slow, staff didn't seem knowledgeable, so that detracted a bit from the experience.",
