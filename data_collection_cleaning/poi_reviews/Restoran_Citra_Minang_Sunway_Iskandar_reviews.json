I didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food! I especially loved the cow's lung. The sambal is mildly spicy but incredibly addictive. I will definitely return to try more dishes!\n\nIn terms of pricing, it's reasonably affordableâ€”not too expensive but not the cheapest either. Plus, there is easy parking available nearby.",

      "text": "We were recommended this restaurant from a facebook group. And we cant believe we didnt find it sooner! Very excellent rumah padang. Large variety of self-service dishes and many favourites like gulai nangka (absolutely delicious by the way!). Many varieties of meat dishes... some I don't know the name but the beef is so tender and well-cooked. And the crispy beef was just like eating crisps/kerupuk! Sambal ijo was another win. They also sell other products like crispy beef skin kerupuk and teh botol. They are a bit more expensive than other places we have been to... the bill for 2 people at lunch was around RM50... but we did pick quite a few items. And I think for the location, taste and quality of the food it was well worth it. We look forward to come back again!",

The rendang meat was so hard and I informed the waitress that I can't even bite it instead she use scissors and cut into small pieces and told me it should be fine. I had a tough time chewing the meat. The least they could do is exchange to a new meat instead but NO. Well its ok.. I am not going to dine here anymore. And the price is ridiculously pricey. There are better Minang places out there with reasonable price.",
