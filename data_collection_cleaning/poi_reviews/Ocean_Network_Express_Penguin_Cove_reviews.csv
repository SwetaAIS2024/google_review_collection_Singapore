Melvin J.,5,"Had an incredible time at Ocean Network Express Penguin Cove in Bird Paradise! The habitat is wonderfully designed, making you feel like you're stepping right into the penguins' world. The environment is clean, well-maintained, and gives the penguins plenty of space to swim and play. The up-close views make it a perfect spot for families, especially with kids who were absolutely fascinated. Highly recommended for anyone looking for an engaging and educational experience!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110204106470894976302/reviews
Kieron,5,"Really cute penguins and penguin bao. Also very amazed by how some tourists need to push people and view. Just wait patiently for your turn, the penguins will still be there. Very cooling place and perhaps the only place that you can stay there for long.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111127323203347067217/reviews
Edwin Li,5,"We recently visited Penguin Cove at Bird Paradise, and it was a highlight of our trip! The exhibit is wonderfully designed, allowing kids to get up close to these adorable creatures. The space is interactive and educational, with plenty of information about the penguins' habitats and behaviors. My kids were thrilled to watch the penguins swim and waddle around, and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable, answering all of our questions with enthusiasm. It's a great spot for families, and we left with smiles all around. Highly recommend for anyone visiting with children!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113316208923277227429/reviews

WK,5,"Awesome experience. You enter from the ground level wondering where are the penguins. But as you make your way up, you will come across a video screening about the King Penguin - a must watch for kids and adults! As you ascend to the top level, you get to see the penguins. We recommend you come many times during your visit to Bird Paradise to catch them during their feeding times. They will be more active and you see them jumping, swimming around the area!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117459234078756899948/reviews
