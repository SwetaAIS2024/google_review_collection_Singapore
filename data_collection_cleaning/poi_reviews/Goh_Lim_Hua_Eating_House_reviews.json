      "text": "The roasted delights is a must go place if you like roasted duck, char siew and roasted pork. The price is reasonable, roasted duck rice is $4.50, mixed roasted pork and char siew is $4.50. The soup is $3 and very nice portion. The sauce is superb. Take note that every wed is their off day. I like the fried mee Hoon from another stall, fried Hokkien mee is also nice! Worth the try. There are plenty of open space car parks. There is a famous temple nearby. Atmosphere is so so cause it‚Äôs a coffeeshop. But it is spacious and airy. So I find it nice to dine in.",

I have to ask them for my order. Instead of asking the lady who incharge of the order and collect payment, she asked me if I paid. I told her to confirm with the lady who took my order. She impatiently handed me my order and said \"okokok\" push my hands to ask me to leave. Her bad  attitude has made me \"wok hey\", hahaha.",
