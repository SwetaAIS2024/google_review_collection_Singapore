Isabelle Koh,5,"Came across this friendly pub without a hint of the dingy and musty characteristics you might expect from a standard bar. Food menu was sizeable enough, and a range of drinks including promotions even for soju!
We opted just for food this time, with a creamy Wild Mushroom soup drizzled with truffle oil, and Smoked Duck pasta which was well-seasoned.
Definitely somewhere you can return for a cosy get-together with loved ones!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111202246520898562041/reviews
