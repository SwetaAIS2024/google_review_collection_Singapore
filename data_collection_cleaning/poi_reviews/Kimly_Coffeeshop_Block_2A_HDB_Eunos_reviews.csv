Theknee C,3,"Small popiah ($4.5 for 2 rolls, 4 small pieces per roll) probably because the hawkers are stingy on the ingredients. Taste ok with nice crunchy bits but nothing remarkable.

Beef hor fun from zichar stall was unremarkable, quite tasteless. Not to mention poor service - staff assumed I was taking away without asking me, probably because I was carrying my bag when I ordered. Didn't apologise upon realising, and when returning the amount charged for takeaway.

Wouldnt order from these stalls again.

The only good thing was that the coffeeshop is clean - perhaps that's driving the prices up.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114292727004577908480/reviews

Big Roy [eatwithroy],2,The rojak is really expensive. For $5 it probably weigh less than 100g. Tasted not bad hence another star. Oh there’s $0.20 for container.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114399014237804415281/reviews
Javin Chan,3,"Ordered Hokkien noodles and fishball minced meat noodles. Hokkien noodles is rather small portion and tasty is just average. The fishball minced meat noodles is the STAR! Noodle is bouncy and meat is just nice. Sorry for the 3-star rate but boo to the Hokkien noodles though, might return to taste test for the Yang Zhou fried rice!
But just fyi the queue for noodle stall is about 20mins, quite insane wait…",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101930097697898261901/reviews
