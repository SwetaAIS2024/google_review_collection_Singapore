Isabelle Tay,5,Food was good! Seafood and meat were all very fresh. Service was quick too. Personally think its btr to order ala carte as the platter looks like more vege than meat. Overall enjoyed the meal and will be back again!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104140455507701408773/reviews
Javier Tan,4,"Food here is good, and portions are still generous, the prices didnâ€™t inflate that much in 2025.

They really improved the location and the service here, the whole foodcourt was generally cleaner.

Personally felt this place was great, food and staff were amazing. But the killer was the extremely tight spacing between guests, led to space issues and particular group beside me kept looking over when their space felt threatened. Generally just bad environment and experience but food saved it.

The service here was amazing! This lady was so nice to help us and explain things to us slowly!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106617631020704357051/reviews
E,4,"This is my first time trying Bangkok Street Mookata at Toa Payoh. They're located in a coffee shop setting like most other branches. If you go late, there's actually a queue because the coffee shop is quite crowded and a lot of people don't eat Mookata, there's a variety of other food.

Anyway we ordered the 4 pax set with additional meat dishes which came up to around $60+ which is quite decent. I wasn't super full but I guess it was also due to the slowness of cooking. I won't blame them but it's because we chose a seat under the big a$$ fan so the wind was strong and even though they had a skirting around the fire, it  affected the fire enough till the soup never really boiled the whole time we were there. So if you want a strong fire,don't sit under the giant fans.

The meat were all nicely marinated, although I didn't really like the beef very much, but it's just me because my friends liked it. The soup was also nicely flavoured. I'd say overall it was a good experience and I would come back again in future",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103665268796109855493/reviews
