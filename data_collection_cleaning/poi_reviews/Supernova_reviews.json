      "text": "Happened to be around the area this afternoon (Saturday 4pm) so dropped by Supernova. Was surprised that it was so empty!\n\nOrdered via the online system and was served the Jasmine Oolong Milk Foam almost immediately. Cup was really huge and they were generous with the milk foam and it was tasty. The tea wasn't as fragrant as I would like it to be, but still ok.\n\nThe fried chicken french toast was served aft 10 minutes. Initially I was abit dissy about the price ($25) for a french toast, but when it was served, it was HUGE. It should be shared amongst 2 pax. Chicken was really crispy, flavorful and nice! The french toast was japan milk bread so it was thick and soft. I feel it could have been soaked in the egg mixture abit longer, but the crispiness and flavor of it was just right.\n\nService was pretty ok, idk why so many reviews dissed them for it.\n\nWhen I asked my friends living in the area why they never mentioned about Supernova, they all went \"OH YA IT IS RLLY GOOD WE SHOULD GO\" -- shows how impressive the food has been!\n\nWill def be back to try other items!",

      "text": "Spent about $90 for 2 pax, i think was a decent price for cafe and so.\n\nFirst upset point - Food serving time\nScrambled eggs was served at 12.33pm, tarter tots at 12.35pm (those was sides) following up with mains, cereal prawn pasta came 12.45pm, Rosti came 12.58pm (after friendly checking in with the staff). We order at about 12.21pm, it took about 30 ish minutes to get food fully served. With such time internal for mains the other party would have finish their mains. So it feels like watching each other eating instead of eating it together.\n\nSecond upset point - Cereal Prawn Pasta\nOh dear, I have no idea did i ordered the wrong item or something, i taste nothing on cereal prawn, there is a herbs or something added into the pasta and i can only taste garlic and that weird taste herbs or something. I had 2-3 mouth and I cant do it anymore. I believe this dish could be better.\n\nEven with 2 upset point, i think coffee is pretty decent and food. Rosti was good even with the long wait. The staff (female) is pretty nice, she apologise twice for the delay, so ok, service wasnt that bad for today.",

      "text": "TLDR: Wouldn’t recommend coming here, better establishments with more affordable prices. hygiene and food safety is a concern.\n\nAfter placing my order, I went to the restroom, which required walking by the kitchen. The smell was overwhelmingly like sewage. While the dining area itself had no odor, walking past the kitchen was unpleasant enough to make me question the hygiene standards. I don’t know the cause, but I sincerely hope management investigates and resolves it if it’s a sanitation issue. The kitchen should not smell like that and food should not be prepared in such a smelly environment.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the Steak Okonomiyaki, expecting at least a medium doneness by default. However, the steak was served rare—so chewy that I couldn’t finish it. When we asked about it, the staff initially said we should have specified our preferred doneness in the order. If that’s the case, it would be helpful for the restaurant to indicate the default doneness on their online ordering platform and let customers know they can request a different level.\n\nThat said, after clearing our plates with the three slices of underdone steak, the service staff checked with the chefs. The chefs acknowledged that the steak was actually undercooked by mistake and was not their usual standard. The server was very apologetic and kindly offered two slices of cake to make up for it, which I appreciated. We tried the Key Lime Tart and Sea Salt Caramel Carrot Cake—both were decent but overly sweet.\n\nAs for the Okonomiyaki, it was enjoyable but didn’t taste like authentic okonomiyaki. It was more similar to rosti with onions. If you’re expecting the traditional Japanese dish, this may not be what you’re looking for. On the other hand, the Pumpkin Bacon Pasta was quite good—rich, flavorful, and generous with the bacon. i would rate it 8/10. The cocktail we got was also pretty nice.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the customer service, but the hygiene concern and the food preparation issues made the experience less enjoyable.\n\nThere should be better and more consistent service, food and dining experience given the prices. Wouldn’t recommend coming here, better establishments with more affordable prices.",

The kids also loved the scrambled eggs and tater tots.\nRosti was crispy on the edges. Nothing special about the egg and sausage.\nAçaí was served frozen and I had to let it thaw a little so minus one star. Fruits were fresh.\nFrench toast with blueberry was yummy.\nService wise, most staff were friendly than not. There was only one guy who didn’t look like he was having a good day but he wasn’t rude.\nWe were told when seated that food will take 30mins so we made orders for those who were late. The food was served fast enough.",
