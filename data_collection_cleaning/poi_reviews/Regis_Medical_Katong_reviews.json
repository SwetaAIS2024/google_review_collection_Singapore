We did a walk-in on a Monday morning and we were seen pretty much immediately. Everyone was so nice, and we were even offered water right when we came in. Their prices are clearly listed at the front desk too. Dr Amit was great and took the time to talk through all of the medication that he was prescribing to us.",

The clinic itself was clean and welcoming, with a calm atmosphere that immediately put me at ease.\n\nDr. Paul is truly exceptional. He took the time to listen to all of my concerns and explained everything clearly, making sure I fully understood my options. Their approach is thorough, and they show genuine care for their patients. I never felt rushed during my appointment, and the entire process, from diagnosis to treatment, was handled with the utmost professionalism",

Luckily, Regis Medical was open, and I was greeted by the beautiful minimalist interior and the kind and lovely doctor and nurse. The doctor was very patient with cleaning my wounds and painstakingly took out all the debris. The nurse was extremely kind and helpful and offered me snacks because I looked pale.\n\nThe services provided by this clinic are impeccable, and I dare say it’s the best care from a GP I’ve ever received. Any patient seeking care can rest assured that they are treated by professionals with the upmost empathy and compassion. I’m truly thankful to them.",

I felt involved in the diagnostic process, and my symptoms and explanations were listened to carefully and acted upon. The surgery is easy to reach by WhatsApp or telephone, and they even kept in touch after referring me to hospital, to check how I was. Wonderful people, and the best experience one could hope for in fairly challenging personal circumstances!",
