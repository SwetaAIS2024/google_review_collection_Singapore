rachel oh,5,"Forever Grateful to This Amazing Tuition Centre!

We are incredibly thankful to Cognitus Academy for the tremendous impact they’ve had on our son’s education journey. With their dedicated guidance and unwavering support, our son achieved his dream grade for English in the PSLE—a goal he had worked so hard for and secured a spot in the IP route in secondary school. It was a proud and emotional moment for our family, and we know it wouldn’t have been possible without the centre’s expert teaching and encouragement.

What sets this centre apart is not just their academic excellence, but the way they genuinely care about each student’s progress. The tutors are patient, passionate, and always go the extra mile. They helped build our son’s confidence, sharpen his writing skills, and develop a strong foundation in English that continues to benefit him now in secondary school.

He’s still attending classes at the centre because he enjoys learning there and continues to grow. We’re so grateful to have found such a nurturing and effective learning environment. Thank you for being such a big part of his success!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110127932546549996672/reviews

Through the years, we see her confidence level in Math increase, from being scared of Math to loving it. We have never regret enrolling her with VM. In fact, our younger girl is also with Mr Wan.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100095890964836179135/reviews
