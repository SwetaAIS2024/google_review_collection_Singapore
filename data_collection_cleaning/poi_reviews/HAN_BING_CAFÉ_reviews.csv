Joyce Ong,5,Have been here several times over the years and the signature dry kimchi ramyeon never fails to disappoint. Yes it's not that cheap but they are generous with the ingredients and the sauce is just so addictive (I really wish I knew how they make it) so I keep coming back!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110200455987536373484/reviews
elayna chin,5,"Was looking for food near Botanics Gardenâ€¦ chanced upon this Korean restaurant thatâ€™s situated in Serene Centre. Was drawn by its deco and the wide array of Korean food. Decided to give it a try~

From the outside it looks small but when youâ€™re inside its very cozy and home-like :) loved the ambience and the waitress was super bubblyâ€” forgot to get her name but I think sheâ€™s the chef too.

We ordered a Classic Army Stew (normal spicy) and a Crispy Korean Pancake as sides. Was very pleased with the taste and the generous servings.

The army stew was rich with kimchi soup and ingredients while the crispy pancake batter and chives were just an absolute treat for the palate!

Itâ€™s a big portion for 2 pax and by the time we finished our meal we had no space for desserts already ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤¤ no regrets tho, will come again for the bingsu! :3",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105460859948112165491/reviews
Kelvin Chye,5,"A fantastic place for Korean food. Here you'll find a good selection of various nice Korean delicacies, with some interesting fusion choice as well. Various portion sizes to chooses from for some of the dishes, especially for bingsu, to fit different appetite capacity.  Friendly and attentive service staff. Do note place is small and limited seatings, so may have to wait if it is crowded.

Would love to come back here again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117999709976505884094/reviews

Pamela Lam,5,"Had dinner with my mum here last night and it was a lovely experience! We ordered beef bibimbap to share and we love how generous they are with the ingredients. Though pricey, it was made up with quality. Weâ€™ll definitely come back again to try the bingsu, which many are raving aboutðŸ˜Š",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101857651194332817338/reviews
