Din Saint,5,"Spacious place to dine in a huge group. There are both indoor and outdoor seating. At night, a live band plays local tunes and accepts songs requests too. Food variety is wide and can be spoiled for choices here. The ambience here is family friendly. The best part is the closing time which stretches way past midnight.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111695026081785780047/reviews
Ong NN,4,"Always go for the roti canai. Is crispy and not so oily.
a lot of variety. Overall the food there taste good. The price slightly higher than normal similar type of shop. But given the clean environment and aircon is worth it.

Selvinia Nofy,5,"I used to visit their cafÃ© when it was still located in Puteri Harbour. I didn't have any expectations after it moved, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the new location feels even better than the previous one. Itâ€™s spacious and clean, and the surroundings are not too crowded. The taste of the food and drinks remains the sameâ€”good and affordable. They also still offer live music.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102676437011264302982/reviews
Gone Fishing,5,"Nice place to have ur meal. Inside of the restaurant is air-conditioned. Perfect for hot weather.

Satay beef 4.5/5
Succulent and juicy. Marination was on point. Tender and crispy. Missing the lemak in between. If the lemak is there the sate will be perfect! Please put the lemak in between.

Nasi goreng tepanyaki seafood 9/10

Butter prawn 7/10. Not the same like the previous singgah selalu at danga bay.. Seems like got salted egg sauce?

Sofina,5,"Came to Mana Cafe when it was at Puteri Harbour. Am pleased with the new location as it is much bigger, brighter & cleaner. There are toilets too which is a plus.  More comfortable to hang out now. Ample parking in the weekday morning & afternoon. We love their roti canai especially roti cheese & their tasty satay.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100177935701773612541/reviews
