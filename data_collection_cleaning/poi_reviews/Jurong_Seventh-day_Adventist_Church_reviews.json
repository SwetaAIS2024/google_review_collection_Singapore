We really felt welcomed the entire time and stayed for lunch. We enjoyed fellowship with the church members who were so sweet, engaging and eager to get to know us. We look forward to returning again and thank the church for its incredible hospitality and warmth. We also found the sermons and Sabbath schools engaging and thought provoking. All round a positive experience at church in every aspect.",
