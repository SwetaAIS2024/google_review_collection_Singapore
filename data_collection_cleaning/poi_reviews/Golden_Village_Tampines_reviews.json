Proper signages are displayed for patrons.\n\nSnacks can be purchased online and redeemed at the Cinema Hall or can also be purchased on site.\n\nThe cinema has vending machines conveniently placed for that additional snack.\n\nAir-conditioning was really good and the place was clean.\n\nThe customer service staff though were not exactly friendly especially the gentleman manning the gate.  He seemed indifferent and did not bother to say \"welcome\" nor bothered to acknowledge my \"thank you\"",

      "text": "GV may be the king of cinemas in Singapore only because others are closing, but it clearly does not deserve that title. I watched a movie in Hall 1, and the seat was so uncomfortable, I started feeling pain in my back and butt after just 25 minutes. It felt like sitting on a flat wooden board.\nThe company is clearly doing well, and ticket prices keep increasing, yet the seats have not been improved for years. How long more do we need to wait for proper upgrades? It is honestly disappointing that Cathay had to close, while GV continues to run with such poor standards. I really wish it was the other way around.",
