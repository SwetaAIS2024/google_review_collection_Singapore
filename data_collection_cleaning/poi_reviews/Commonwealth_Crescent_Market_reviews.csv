Michi,5,"Tucked away in an unassuming corner of the hawker centre, I stumbled upon what might just be one of the best bowls of minced pork porridge I’ve had in a long time. It wasn’t planned, nor was I expecting much—just a quick meal to tide me through the day. But oh, was I in for a surprise.

Surprisingly one of the best minced pork porridges I’ve had! The uncle was super generous with the meat, and the porridge was smooth and comforting. Added an egg, total came to $5.50—not the cheapest, but absolutely worth it. I can’t stop thinking about it!

The hawker centre is also clean and dry. The cleaners are also very polite and friendly!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114920634455322009945/reviews
Jeffrey C,5,Porridge is 5 stars. Pork Rib Noodles is 5 stars. Both chicken rice stalls are 5 stars. Old auntie’s dessert stall is 5 stars (not sure if she’s still selling). Carrot cake is super popular (but not really my favourite). This place has so many of my favourite stalls.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106833163410885808643/reviews
LexTeo8888,3,"Nice place for porridge...but coffee not that palatable regardless whichever stall U try. Carrot cake is supposed to be good and long queue, but loses out to the Clementi food centre one in terms of taste and portion size.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115467381167777606695/reviews

TCH,4,"Old Estate Market cum Hawker Centre.  Ample parking spaces.  Surprisingly one can find many local delights here and it is also my first time eating here; definitely not the last.

Tried this BCM stall the taste is very good too.  Ample parking in the open air carpark!

AB GRILL Western food price is reasonable; decent meal for the price.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467592239988127131/reviews
