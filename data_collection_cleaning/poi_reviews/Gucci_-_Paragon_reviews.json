      "text": "The sales staff Lucy Mu was attentive and sweet to answer all my queries. Especially now, there is a Doraemon collaboration.\nGood effort from her.\n\nLocation at level 1 of Paragon.\nQuite spacious. Had 2 levels\n\nStore design was as expected of a high end store. Well decorated and classy.\n\nBags, belts, ready to wear, shoes.\nAll look so nice. Just need the wallet to be fatter a bit, to buy.\n\nStrongly recommended!",

My recommendation to anyone interested in buying Gucci in Singapore is to go to the Gucci flagship store at Marina Bay Sands mall instead. Motivated staff, large selection and a bit of â€žthe extra mileâ€œ experience.",
