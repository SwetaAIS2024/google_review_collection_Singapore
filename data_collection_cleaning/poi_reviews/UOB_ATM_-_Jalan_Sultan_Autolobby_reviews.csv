Joshua Liong,1,"Machine ate my ATM card :(
Also suspicious since the card insertion slot does indeed look different from the warning.

Steps I took:
1. Insert card and punch in PIN
2. Select account
3. Select withdraw
4. Type the amount to withdraw (note that it does not do decimals. Standard ATM fare)
5. Select “withdraw from local currency”
6. Get the screen “Your card has been retained”",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113589116589180875894/reviews
