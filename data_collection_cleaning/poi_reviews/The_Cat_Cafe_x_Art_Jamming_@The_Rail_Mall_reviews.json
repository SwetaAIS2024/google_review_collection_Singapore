Attached are various photos I have taken of the cats roaming around the cafe. Sushi was absolutely a chill cat even though the owners said she would bite. Hope all the cats will be safely rehomed after the closure.",

      "text": "The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, is a perfect spot to relax and unwind. The staff were friendly, both to us and the cats, and they clearly prioritize the well-being of the animals.\nThe cats themselves were adorable and well cared for, with plenty of playful and affectionate personalities to go around. I appreciated the variety of toys and spaces provided for them, which allowed them to interact naturally without feeling stressed.\nThe menu had a decent selection of beverages and snacks, but, I didn’t pay much attention to the taste of the food because I was too busy enjoying the cats. The café also maintained a good balance of cleanliness and comfort, which can be tricky with so many furry friends around.\nOverall, this is a must-visit for cat lovers or anyone looking for a unique and calming café experience. I’ll definitely be coming back!",

Felt like the cats were treated really well and the staff were really passionate with their work and very sociable.\n\nThis is a cat cafe I would reccomend you to go if you wanna also art jam, as I also took it up. It came with a free drink as well! Even without the art jam, this is a worthwhile cat cafe to visit.\n\nAll the cats felt very well taken care off, and will definitely come back again.",
