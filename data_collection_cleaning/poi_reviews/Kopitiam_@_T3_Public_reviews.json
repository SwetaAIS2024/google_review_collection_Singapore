      "text": "Kopitiam – Changi Airport T3 (Post-Renovation)\n\nThere have been many new additions since Kopitiam reopened after renovations in April 2025. I don’t usually visit the airport often, so I’ll be updating my review as I try more dishes from the different stalls.\n\nKorean & Japanese Stall – I went with the Saba fish, which was uniquely paired with sambal chilli. I was pleasantly surprised by how well our local sambal complemented the Saba—it was an unexpected but delicious twist. Loved it!",

      "text": "P.S: It gets very annoying lately to leave review because google never upload the photos and videos properly on the 1st or 2nd tries!\n\nFood: 4\nService: 3\nAtmosphere: 5\n\nI remember the only food court we could find in Changi Airport was the one in the basement, mainly existed for the staff. It was like a hidden secret for those who wanted to grab an affordable meal before flying or selling kidney so that they wouldn't starve during the trip.\n\nIt's great now we have many food court for public, and T3 is not exception. They are located in the basement 2, it opens 24 hour! And the signage is clear, no longer some kind of insider secret anymore.\n\nThe price is around or slightly more expensive than regular food court. Food price has increased significantly in Singapore everywhere. There are plenty of seats and that is great, too. The choices are okay, I think if you are not picky, you can always find something to eat.",

      "text": "Newly renovated and newly reopened in early December 2024, so the environment is clean and refreshed. There’s many stalls but although it’s supposed to be opened 24 hours, when I was there only 3 stalls functioning. Maybe it was newly opened so not many stalls fully opened yet.\nTried to order something from  chicken rice stall but many options unavailable though the stall keeper was helpful.\nIn the end I had some Kaya bun and tea. Nothing really special but the price was affordable for the set. It’s below $4. So if you want a snack you can have this. A good place to take a rest in the late night in Changi Airport as there’s many seats and tables to use too.",

The set meal serving size is very big, guess that's why it's quite costly too. Hope there will be more vegetarian options available in the food court next time.",
