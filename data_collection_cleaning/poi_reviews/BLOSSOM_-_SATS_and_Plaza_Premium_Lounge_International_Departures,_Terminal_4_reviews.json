The laksa is amazing, and while the food options are limited, everything tastes good.\n\nThe shower area is clean and has everything you need, which is a big plus. My only complaint is that the lighting could be better—it feels a bit dim in some areas.\n\nOverall, it’s a solid lounge with good service and a chill vibe.",

For me  I'm travelling with Jetstar. My Qantas gold member got me free access. The food is all right cos I love laksa. The seating are all very good and I love it.",

      "text": "I had a pleasant experience at this airport lounge. The first thing I noticed was how clean and well-maintained the space was. It felt very welcoming and provided a calm atmosphere, which was perfect for relaxing before my flight. The seating was comfortable, with plenty of options to suit both solo travelers and groups. The staff were courteous and attentive, ensuring that everything was running smoothly.\n\nHowever, the food selection was on the smaller side. While the options available were fresh and of good quality, I would have appreciated a bit more variety, especially for those with longer layovers. Perhaps a wider range of snacks or hot dishes could elevate the overall experience even further.\n\nThat said, the cleanliness, peaceful ambiance, and attentive service made it a worthwhile visit. I would definitely consider coming back, especially if there are improvements in the food offerings in the future.\n\nLet me know if you’d like further refinements!",

Apart from the laksa which is prepared off the stove, the rest of the hot stations are room temperature. No more soup on offer besides the bread station and no cheese as well. Environment below eye level is decent, look up the ceiling and the upkeep is horrendous for a terminal of Changi calibre, a shame by Singapore standards!",
