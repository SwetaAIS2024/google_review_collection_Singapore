Jacob TAN,4,"Kway chap has generous amount of ingredients. The braised sauce is nice and the intestine and pork belly is tasty. Very generous with the noodles.
The pig trotters also soft and tasty even though bought quite early in the morning. They must have cooked it very early I. The morning.
Service here is good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
KS Tan,5,"The photo does not do justice to the taste of the food. Was craving for kway chup and found this little set up in Hougang.

Affordable and good taste. Definitely will return again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110216657749799735047/reviews
Calvin Lee,5,"Never expect this Kway Chap store to serve up one of the nicer ones I have had for a while. The kway broth has a tinge of herbal taste which brings a bitter sweet aftertaste. I ordered $11 portion which comes with 2 bowl of kway and a good portion of braised tofu, taupok, pork belly and intestines (I opt out of pig skin since I’m not a lover). For the price, it definitely was value for money. Each portion of the food is nicely marinated with the braised sauce, not too salty or sweet with the right balance. Overall, standard for this store is a thumbs up for me.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107758079475922101192/reviews
