HC L,3,Nice place to chill out. Many tables available in the late afternoon. Good for studying and working. Not sure if free Wifi was available. Chicken pie was decent and Chai Latte was strong.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
Ian Chiam,2,"We ordered 5 log cakes as Christmas gifts for friends and associates. Notice of pick up was given 4 days back with a reminder on the eve. However, when we arrived this morning after 10 in the morning, the staff told us that they did not have the Christmas boxes. So we had no choice but accept them in commercial packing as we don‚Äôt know when those boxes will arrive though we must have paid for them in the price. The employees were apologetic and polite but we were totally disappointed and embarrassed by the packaging. I am sure the management must have a response to such a poor customer service!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107375673232756453729/reviews
Phong Jansen,3,"A simple and spacious location with an open kitchen concept. Food was normal but the food presentation is really good üòπ

Perhaps just that day, the prawn feels pretty old, got issues to remove the shell. Their soup is pretty good though, would have went really well with bread.

Favourite was the very cold air conditioning! Though I find it pretty wierd that food is served to us but not the cutlery. Not much of a problem with that just personal opinion.

Will be back to try baked stuff next time!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110851370177505265907/reviews
