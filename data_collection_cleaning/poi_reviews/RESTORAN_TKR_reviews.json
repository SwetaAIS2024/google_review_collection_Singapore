Decided to gamble and give it a try.\n\nI ordered Maggi goreng with fried egg, 2 plain roti canai, 1 roti bom, 1 roti telur, iced Nescafe, and iced tea O. Despite the crowd, everything was served within 20 minutes. Staff were friendly and attentive.\n\nThe total came to only RM26, very reasonable for the portion and variety!\n\nGreat for a quick meal before heading to Legoland.",

Not sure how much it costs to get a plate with your choice of meats and vegetables, but it may be a better option if youâ€™re feeling hungry, as portions can be small for the items on the menu. Prices are low, so you canâ€™t expect the largest portions, but the servings are decent value.",

He should put greater effort in training the staff in terms of efficiency and service. The food is okay and the location is perfect. However, the quality of service is very low. There are many staff but no one was even paying attention when I was awaiting and asking for help. Or they just ignore or pretend not to notice. It happened so many times. Probably today's visit would be my last visit to this restaurant. I feel not good whenver I visit here.",
