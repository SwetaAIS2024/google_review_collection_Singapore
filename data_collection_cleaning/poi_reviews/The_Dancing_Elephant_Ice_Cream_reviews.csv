LAWRENCE TEH,5,Love everything here. We are ice cream lover and we found the best ice cream in town. The texture and taste are superb. Mine is salty ice cream and the other one is sweet one. The price is ++ but definitely I will come back again and again. Thanks for the good effort in coming out the yummy ice cream. My next try is the brendy chocolate.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118333846970008274591/reviews
Peggy M,5,"Just as other reviewers have said, the speculoos and salt flavor ice cream is so special! I also really enjoy their homemade biscuits/cookies. They are so buttery and tasty. Don’t be surprised if they are sometimes sold out. There are nut-free brownies for customers who are nut-averse. I return because I know a portion of the proceeds goes towards a rescue elephant in India.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102954594706702648562/reviews
Crystal Koh,4,"Tried their mocha fudge vanilla ice cream ($5) and kaya ($3.50) along with waffle ($7). The waffle tasted slightly too salty and not really crispy, though it’s airy and light. Saw a hole in the kaya ice cream scoop and felt the portion could have been more and flavour stronger too. Mocha fudge was nice. There are tables outside the stall to sit and drawing paper and pens for kids to scribble.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115830770081303202896/reviews
Mark Tho,4,"Very good ice cream. Not many flavors but the two we ordered was very nice.

Maple bacon ice cream. Bacon option as topping on maple base ice cream. Really yummy and great texture. Melts fast so make sure you finish it!

Thai mango ice cream was also great! Had many mango ice creams but Thai mango ice cream was pleasantly different. Something different and uncommon so try it.

ysl,3,"Nice to hear that part of their proceeds goes to supporting wildlife conservation efforts however ice cream definitely wasn’t the best nor the worse, just decent. Cashier also seemed abit stern and lukewarm albeit well mannered if that makes sense.

Prices for single scoop from $4 onwards; dark chocolate wasn’t aromatic and lacked the bitter after taste while their signature salted speculoos was alright but overly sweet, best to be shared.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102400248972139641973/reviews
