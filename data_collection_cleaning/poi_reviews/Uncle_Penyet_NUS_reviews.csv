Alvin P,5,"Tried the steamed chicken w brown rice.  Really fresh tender chicken, and soft fuffy brown rice... seriously delicious!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117344204721580748388/reviews
Linda L,3,"The signs don't keep up with the rate at which prices are being increased; ate here as I read the stall being recommended. Definitely a solid fried chicken, though freshness of leaves is meh and tofu lacks some flavor.
Overall decent meal for the price, but perhaps doesn't live up to its good old days?",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101175583833500833132/reviews

Roger Tan,5,"My order when Iâ€™m there is the chicken wing rice. For just over four dollars, it is very value for money. The chicken wing is flavourful, with a slightly thicker crisp coating than normal. However, this gives it a nice crunch. This dish is served with curry rice.

Do request for ""nasi lemak"" chili as it elevates the flavour profile of the chicken and cuts through the oiliness too.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114718856388068742054/reviews
