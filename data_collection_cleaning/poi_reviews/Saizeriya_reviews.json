      "text": "Undoubtedly the cheapest (or rather reasonable and affordable) chain restaurant that offer simple Italian dishes.\n\nFor a table of 3, we ordered one mushroom soup each, 3 mains (Scallop Cream Gratin with Salmon, Black Truffle & Mushroom Pasta and a Grilled Salmon) and a few side dishes for sharing (Oven Grilled Escargot, Parma Ham Salad, Parma Ham Pizza, Grilled Green Mussels with Lime Garlic, Bake Clams and Chicken Wings).\n\nOverall, the mains are delicious and reasonably priced, especially the New item on the menu; Scallop Cream Gratin with Salmon.\n\nFor the sides, the Oven Grilled Escargot is the most disappointing as the taste appeared to be different from what I have eaten in the past. However, the new item, Grilled Green Mussels with Lime Garlic tasted much better with the sweet sour savoury spicy combination taste of the lime and garlic. The Baked Clams is dry and unappealing. Next, the chicken wing is not appealing as well both in terms of size and taste but expected for the price paid.\n\nBoth new Parma ham dishes, salad and pizza is delicious and reasonably priced. The mushroom soup is just normal,  given the price, I would not mind even if it was prepared straight out from the can.\n\nFor desserts, we ordered new dessert, Matcha Yuzu Cheesecake and Chocolate Lava. Both are not a disappointment; the cheesecake is not overly sweet and the Chocolate lava, is great to have to end the dinner since it is their best seller.\n\nOverall, our dining experience is great. We went on a weekday night as there is a queue even after 8.00pm. Luckily we arrived early to beat the queue, else there may be a waiting time of at least 20 minutes.",

      "text": "Came here 3 times in 2 weeks recently. Service just went from ok to terrible. Ironically, the best service I had was on a Saturday afternoon when it was peak period and crowded. Staff were very attentive and food was served fast; dirty dishes cleared fast etc. The other 2 times- weekday 3pm (non peak) was when service was very lacking and inattentive. Today was the worst- came at 230pm and ordered a pasta with wine and lava cake to be served later.\nWas seated at a table with crumbs, and the next table had lots of food crumbs on the seats which weren't cleaned at all.\nIt was non peak hours so it wasn't busy and I saw staff chit chatting and congregating at the kitchen entrance laughing when there were tables with dirty dishes uncleared. I finished my pasta and wine and kept waiting for a staff to come by but no one did as they were too busy chatting. Finally a female staff in black came and I told her dessert could be served. Alas it never came after a long wait. No one bothered to even glance at the customers. The staff were all having their own party at the kitchen entrance. In the end I went to the cashier and paid- clearly telling them to take the dessert off my bill as it was never served. She apologised twice. Cheap food and decent of her to apologise but staff should do their job during non peak hours and not just chat and fool around. Didn't take any photos this time but photos here are of my 1st visit to this branch (hamburg, mushroom soup with white wine).\nBetter come here during peak hours for better service.",
