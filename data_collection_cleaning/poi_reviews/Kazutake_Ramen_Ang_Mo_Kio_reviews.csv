KK L,1,"Ordered 2 bowls of chashu ramen, end up both soup is not consistent and taste different, salty.
Chawanmushi: order 2, 1 with ikura, tested average.
Tuna sashimi : comes in 3 thick pieces and totally i didn't eat it. My family also told me not to eat as it was dark and doesn't look fresh at all. I rather forfeit the sashimi.
Overall, won't be returning and don't understand such kind of sashimi, restaurant also able to serve to guests.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107802563297429330493/reviews

Greis T,3,"Had a late dinner - price point is good for what it offered. Ramen was decent, with a rich broth that is not overall too salty. Pork used was marinated and thinly sliced. The noodles itself was a bit too hard.

They did the fried squid well- it was crispy and not too oily overall. It was tender and fresh.

The mini chirashi don was disappointing. All the fresh fish were soaked with soy sauce and I couldnâ€™t taste the fish at all :( Rice was also a bit too mushy for me.

The California Maki and Mango Fresh Milk were value for money. The drink only cost $3.50!

Overall, I liked the atmosphere and the place; but would only go there if I have no other Japanese food to choose from.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117505720121476875881/reviews
Jeremy Khoo,5,"Found this gem in the AMK heartlands. Unassuming self service Japanese restaurant with a wide menu and chill atmosphere. All the ramen we tried was delicious and generous with the ingredients. The soups were not too heavy with qiu qiu noodles, perfect for a light meal. Standout was the chirashi which was filled with fresh fish and ingredients, well worth the price. Washed it down with a yummy and reasonably priced bubble tea. Will definitely come back again for more.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101975552015179312270/reviews
