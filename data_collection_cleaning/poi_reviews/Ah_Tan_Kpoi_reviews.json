So polite, friendly & considerate :-)\n\nWe ordered the breakfast set & only paid $3.50 which if we order from the two famous kopi places in shopping mall…. AK or TB, it will easily cost us another $2!\n\nLove the bread texture as it is soft. & they are generous in their kaya & butter spread!\n\nLove the teh!  Thick & not too sweet.  Nice!!",

Kaya is too sweet and the toasts is way too sweet without sliced butter or margarine to balance off the taste.\n\nI was in a rush and did not check with the staffs. Hope that it is just a missed on their end.",
