Turtle Puff Vlogs,5,"Visited on a weekday afternoon and there were sufficient seats to enjoy the desserts & drinks. Ordered a hot mocha, croffle with Oreo ice cream, crispy matcha croffle and banana pudding matcha latte for a total of $47.63. Everything tasted really good! I like the kunafe in the matcha for the matcha croffle. The banana pudding matcha latte had just the right amount of sweetness and thickness. Will definitely visit again!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105368545350638722999/reviews
yixuan,4,"banana pudding matcha was pretty unique, and I liked that there were actual banana pieces in the drink. not too sweet, and the matcha flavour still came through. quite a big cup though $9.80+ is slightly steep. earl grey matcha was average. enjoyed the matcha cheese sammies; the cheese was punchy n the matcha cookie crust complemented the cheesiness surprisingly well

the place was really packed (1pm on a public holiday) and we waited 30min for our banana pudding and sammies",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116395060718653547323/reviews
Jun Hong Kang,5,"Came across this cafe many times on social media and today I finally tried it and I wished I've came here earlier.

The crispy matcha croffle was one of the best dessert I've ever tried. The matcha taste was very prominent while the croffle was crispy and buttery, along with the kunafeh which is made from shredded crispy phyllo pastry dough, the whole combination was perfect. Definitely would be back just for this.

I also tried the banana pudding matcha and it was also good. I was afraid that the banana pudding might be too sweet however it was just slightly sweetened and very well balanced.

I wonder if they might consider adding pistachio crumbs or pistachio paste as a topping to the matcha croffle as I believe it would be quite a good combination.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114391004118123754474/reviews
smolbelly,5,"Heard good things about this cafe that is currently having matcha-themed desserts! Here’s what we had:

🧀𝐓𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐒𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐞 ($𝟏𝟓.𝟖𝟎)
🧇𝐂𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐩𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞 ($𝟏𝟔.𝟖𝟎)
🍌🍵𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐚 𝐏𝐮𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 ($𝟗.𝟖𝟎)
☕️🍵𝐄𝐚𝐫𝐥 𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐋𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞 ($𝟖.𝟖𝟎)

They were really generous with their ingredients because the 𝐓𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐒𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐞 ($𝟏𝟓.𝟖𝟎) was really cheesy and the 𝐂𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐩𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞 ($𝟏𝟔.𝟖𝟎) had lots of the kunafeh matcha. Both were really indulgent and could get cloying after a while so bring your appetite for this!

I also really enjoyed the 𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐚 𝐏𝐮𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 ($𝟗.𝟖𝟎) which had a generous amount of banana pudding and the matcha flavour was intense enough. Would have preferred less ice but hearsay they are having new cups soon so the ice won’t be as much!
