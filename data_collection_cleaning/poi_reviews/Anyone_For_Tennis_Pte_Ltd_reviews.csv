Tina Ling,5,"I had the pleasure of working with Coach Dave for tennis lessons, and the experience was fantastic. Coach Dave is not only incredibly fun and engaging, making the sport enjoyable for both kids and adults, but also provides individualized technical feedback that truly elevated my game. What stood out most was Coach Dave's responsiveness to our needs and questions, creating a supportive and dynamic learning environment that helped us improve our tennis skills immensely. Highly recommend for tennis enthusiasts of all ages!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108698327754415345155/reviews
