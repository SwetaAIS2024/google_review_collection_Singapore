The only complaint is that the noodles is a bit soft and soggy, next time must ask them to not overcook it. The fried noodles texture is okay with lots of meat.",

I have the latter one as I spotted some interesting chili oil at the counter and thought it will go very well with it.\n\nThe dumplings were light and have a good texture around it while the meat balls essentially were pressed meat balls or slices that has a define chewiness to it. I love the contrast of the ingredients.\n\nThe noodles for $2.80 was great, I topped it up with some chili oil and it was such a great add on to the soup I have ordered.\n\nThis make me even more curious of what kind of Funian cuisine could be out there.",
