What’s the difference!?????? Don’t be so rigid and inflexible.\nWe actually wanted 2 gula, 1 peanut and 1 coconut - not even allowed. Tsk tsk tsk!  Bad marketing and selling strategy.\n\nAnd it’s $5.. 4 pcs\nAnd it’s so small.!\n\nAnd the new peanut flavor, again a mislabel - it’s actually peanut butter - NOT NICE.\nBetter if it’s dry crushed peanuts and sugar.\n\nAnd the gula Melaka, so much less gula inside now - look at the pics- it’s NOT enjoyable anymore.\n\nWon’t be coming back.",

But I got a rude shock and horror.. when I finally can feast on my post meal dessert after a terrible day at work.\n\nSeriously being an ardent fan and supporter of you, I really cannot accept this. It’s just not the same dish without it.",

Took away 3 boxes of Gula Melaka filling for $10.50 and asked for the coconut shavings to put at the side as I wasn’t intending to consume immediately.\n\nThe Putu Piring was made fresh on the spot - Exterior was fluffy and topped with nicely grated coconut shavings along with the right amount of sweetness from the Gula Melaka in each piece, it was a delight in every bite.\n\nI’m Chinese and Putu Piring is like a relative to our Tutu but I think I prefer Putu Piring!",

I used to have these as a teenager,  but it's no longer a must-have food whenever I am in Singapore.  It's definitely worth a try for tourists. The price for 4 pieces is $2.50 in January 2025.",
