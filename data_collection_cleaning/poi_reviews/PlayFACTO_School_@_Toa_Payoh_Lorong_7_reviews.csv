Limin Wong,5,"I really appreciate Ms Amanda and the teachers, they are caring and responsible, which sets my mind at ease during work. They also go extra mile by helping to send/pick up my child to gymnastics class opposite, walk her down to bus stop and sometimes waiting with her when we were late for pick up. All teachers are nice and pleasant, my child is always happy in the centre.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101237395758538486324/reviews

Danny Sng,5,"Beyond convenience, TPY PlayFACTO foster holistic child development. Qualified staff oversee my daughter, Esther homework assistance, ensuring academic progress, while curated activities—from sports to arts—stimulate creativity and critical thinking.

Cecilia Fernandez,5,"The teachers at PlayFACTO are very kind and caring.

I always see the teachers smiling and laughing with the students while waiting for parents to pick them up.
This is very heartwarming!

The teachers also ensure homework is completed before the end of the day and that my child is ready for her spelling and Ting Xie every week.

I receive prompt updates when my child returns back from CCA both on the apps and through message.

Lastly I would like to say that the staff in the centre really goes the extra mile to send the my child down to the car, they ensure my child gets into the car safely and shelters her to the car when it is raining.

Great work teachers!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102992198226947886350/reviews
