John Wong,5,"Highly advanced and convenient convenience store which opens for 24 hours! Selling almost all the essentials you need to (barely) survive residential Life here :) From Suan la mian to combs to condoms etc etc, you'll gladly pack your goods into a super cute Octobox plastic bag at the amazingly efficient and high tech self checkout room! (The self checkout automatically detects all your items once they are in the area :o ) Just remember to sign up and register your palm for extra extra convenience! (And also that if you get locked in the checkout room you can press Exit without Purchase on the screen instead of losing your mind) Website and membership system still in the works but im sure it can only get better !",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114637193739314128743/reviews
