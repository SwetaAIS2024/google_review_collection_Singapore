      "text": "Bought 2 set of satay from 2 different stall tonight,  just to see which one hit our taste bud 😉  in term of prices both are more or less the same.But We're definitely in loveeeee with Adimann Satay!\nWe reached East Coast Lagoon food Village  at almost 11pm,but impressively their satay taste fresh ,juicy and perfectly grilled!\nAnd the best part there's lemak aka fat  in between the mutton satay. That's an absolute syioook!\nThe peanut sauce is a lil more to the spicy side and the peanut are more blended. Nevertheless it goes well with the chicken & mutton satay that we bought.\nThou, its late night but they still smiled and were friendly to customers 👍",

The portions are generous and the flavours are superb. My guests were so impressed that they asked me to recommend his stall. Will definitely patronise him again. Highly recommended! Thank you, Deen and chefs!",
