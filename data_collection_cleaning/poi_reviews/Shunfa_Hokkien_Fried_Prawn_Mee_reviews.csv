Totally awful compared to my first time eating Hokkien Mee at the same stall.

Come here during lunch time Hokkien Mee is already pre-cooked, just warmed it and served. Totally soggy and watery. Anyone can also cooked Hokkien Mee if this is the standard of $6.00

The rest of the 1 Star review given here is justifiable.

I have also downgraded from 5 Stars to a miserable 1 Star.

Failed miserably.

***************************************
I'm still reeling from the incredible Hokkien Mee experience I had at Shunfa! As a self-proclaimed Hokkien Mee connoisseur, I was blown away by the flavors, textures, and sheer generosity of this unassuming stall.

I opted for the $6 plate, which I thought was an absolute steal considering the generous serving of noodles, prawns, and pork. The noodles were cooked to perfection - springy, yet yielding to the bite. The prawns were succulent and fresh, while the pork added a delightful textural contrast.

Now, onto the pièce de résistance - the sauce! Oh, the sauce! It was like a symphony of flavors on my palate - savory, sweet, and umami all harmonized in perfect unison. I could taste the depth of flavor that only comes from using high-quality ingredients and a carefully guarded recipe.

If I have one quibble, it's that the serving of Belacan Chilli was woefully inadequate. I mean, we're talking less than a teaspoon here! I had to request extra, and while the staff obliged, the additional serving was equally miserly. Come on, Shunfa! Your customers need that spicy kick!

But here's the thing - despite this minor complaint, I'm still willing to give Shunfa a full 5 stars. Why? Because the quality of the noodles, the freshness of the ingredients, and the sheer deliciousness of the sauce all combine to create a truly unforgettable Hokkien Mee experience.

So, to all my fellow Hokkien Mee enthusiasts out there, be warned: Shunfa is the real deal. And while some of you might leave a bad review later (I'm looking at you, Hokkien Mee purists!), I'm willing to bet that the vast majority of you will be, like me, utterly blown away by this incredible stall.

In short, Shunfa Hokkien Fried Prawn Mee is an absolute must-visit for anyone who loves this beloved Singaporean dish. Don't be put off by the modest prices ($6, $8, $12, $15) - trust me, you won't find a better Hokkien Mee experience anywhere else.

Get ready to join the ranks of the Hokkien Mee obsessed, folks!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116759225490774107700/reviews
Josephine N.,2,"I came here twice. Both times ordered the $8 portion. First time the taste was OK, no wok hei, but the broth taste still OK. Prawns were fresh and big so although a bit ex and portion a bit small I accepted. Today went back and a lady took my order. I didn't see if the person cooking was the same, but it was really bad. No idea what I was tasting. No wok hei nvm the broth also no taste. The pork lard not even fried. No standard one. Will not go back.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105486183636473039942/reviews
Khoo Chee Yam,1,"Has been longing for a fried hokkien mee stall at the hawker stall. However to much disappointment, the smell of the kansui is so strong, the taste is so bland and lack of umami and wok hei. The only commendation is the prawns they used are large and fresh enough that has the sweetness to overcome the blandness. 1 star for the prawns.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114844620013502309635/reviews
Roy,1,"Took away a $6 portioned one, not a fan of yellow noodles and they use 100% yellow noodles. Starchy, sticky and tasteless broth. Pork lards are also out for a very long time, no crispiness at all. Chilli is okay but definitely not compatible with their noodles.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106500767791792704294/reviews
Felicia Yong,1,"The food is really bad…. And the pricing is crazy for the standard… We bought $15 (got queue so we thought good) end up we ate abit and throw it away cause it was legit very hard to eat….
