Agnes,5,"I recently engaged Sunscreen for the installation of roller blinds and awnings at my home, and I couldn't be happier with the results. From start to finish, the entire process was seamless and professional.

A special shout-out to Simon, the project manager, who truly went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect. Simon's attentiveness and exceptional customer service made a significant difference. He was always available to answer my questions, provide updates, and address any concerns I had. His dedication to after-sales service is equally impressive, ensuring that everything continues to function smoothly long after the installation.

I highly recommend Sunscreen for anyone looking for top-notch roller blinds and awning installation services. Their team, especially Simon, delivers outstanding quality and customer care.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108398628076291530737/reviews

lakshmi raju,1,"Got 3 retractable awnings and 1 indoor roller blind from them 4 years ago. Problems started soon after they installed these, they came to repair a couple of times but after that stopped sending anyone. So not we have the awnings and blinds which are just sitting in our house and stuck at one position. Cannot open or close anymore. Waste of money and you will not get service either even after the high amounts they charge for installing their products. Donâ€™t waste your money here, go elsewhere for getting products which actually work.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115820686082688279365/reviews
