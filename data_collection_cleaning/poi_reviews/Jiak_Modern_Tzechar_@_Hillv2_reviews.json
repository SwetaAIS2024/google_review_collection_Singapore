We were moved to a bigger table midway through to accommodate for more space for our ordered dishes as suggested by the staff which was much appreciated!\n\nGood standard of zichar food as its name suggests and could see why they are a main stay within this hillv2 area. Would probably be back to try out other dishes.",

Location was far but no complains as other nearby halal restaurants that offers the CNY specials were all fully booked. Staff were all attentive and helped with the lo hei cheers and well wishes. Overall, nice experience and food served were all piping hot and nice.",

While we were eating there was another table beside us, but the other tables were so much squeezed together that my wife, while we were eating, was asked to stand up and wait aside so they could serve the other table. There simply was not enough space for the staff to get to other tables.\n\nNext time I think better to just eat at home. Anything but a peaceful meal when dining in which is a pitty because the food is genuinely good.",

The chye poh tofu is a bit small in size but taste still OK. The sour and spicy fish soup ingredients are really too little. Finally the mango ice dessert is really nice with real mango cube at the top. Overall still OK but price is on the high side + portion rather small.",
