Blackraven,5,"Tried the curry noodle, not bad, the curry is rich and thick. Also tried the laksa, where I highly recommend the Yong Tau Fu laksa which is only 50cents more than the regular one. Mee Siam comes with thick rich gravy, and must add a piece of Otah. Also tried the rice options like Nasi Lemak, and Mee Rebus, not bad!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114385515451710838076/reviews
Y√®,3,"Frequented by the work crowd in the area, the portions of food are filling enough and reasonably affordable. There‚Äôre options to add a fried fish cake and choice of regular drink to your set meal. My sambal fried rice was decent and although is on the wetter side, was tasty and fragrant. Coffee is dependably good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110205858157050835887/reviews

suhas naik,2,Average taste. Rude staff. Even there was not much rush the staff if not keen to help in selection to foreigners. Seems this is famous cafe with main branch on 67 killiney road.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103665468060836615580/reviews
Daniel,4,"Ordered their Kaya Butter Toast set. The half boil eggs are perfectly cooked. You have to de-shell the eggs personally. If it's a problem, ask if the staff can crack the eggs for you.

The butter in the kaya toast was  a 'Little' disappointing...Little is the key word here...pun intended. Killiney Kopitiam @ East Coast Road was way more generous with their butter. You get a 'whole' slab of butter that covers almost the entire length of the toast! Here you get 4 tiny squares and you can't taste or feel the butter in your mouth. Can be either good or bad depending on your butter tolerance! I have seen people removing the butter from their kaya butter toast and throwing the butter away. üòÇ

More butter like what I get at Killiney East Coast and I will add 1 more ‚≠ê.

Service was excellent by friendly and chatty staff that were proud of her barista craft and highly recommend her kopi-peng! That's great!

Highly recommended!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100196593170329614557/reviews
