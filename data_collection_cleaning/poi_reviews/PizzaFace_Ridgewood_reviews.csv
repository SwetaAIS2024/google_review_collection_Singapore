AC Chan,5,"This thin-crust pizza has a perfectly crisp crust, soft and chewy center, and a party of ham, bacon, salami, minced beef ragu on a luscious tomato sauce base. Oh, and did we mention the runny egg? üç≥ Just picture that rich, golden yolk dripping over every bite‚Ä¶
But wait, there‚Äôs more! We couldn‚Äôt get enough of the golden, crispy fried calamari paired with perfectly seasoned fries tossed in truffle oil and topped with grated parmesan cheese üßÄ. üòò",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Minghui Chua,5,"We have always been ordering from grab and wanted to come down to try it. The pizza was absolutely amazing! the crust, the taste and the thickness was perfect. carbonara was super cheesy and creamy, just the way it should be.

This place is one hidden gem that serves really good pizza and pasta. We‚Äôll always be back and will continue to order delivery as well. (But it‚Äôs definitely way better when you dine in!)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104003443972683602666/reviews
The Eating Shrimp,4,"Their pizza surprisingly wasn‚Äôt the star. This was the Gorgonzola & Spinach Pizza, it was pretty underwhelming (not cheesy enough, the caramelised onions were too sweet). Ironically the really good dish, I didn‚Äôt take a photo‚Ä¶ but the oven-baked penne with mixed mushroom & truffle cream was the BOMB. So good.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113289028711322653544/reviews
