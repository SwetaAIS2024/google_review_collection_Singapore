Khairil Azmi,3,"This feedback is solely for the betterness of our mosque. The cleanliness could be much improved. The carpet looks quite old and worn out. Already the time to replace with newer & more comfortable one. Interestingly, while Masjid Darul Aman looks so huge from outside, but it feels so small once we are in. The layout of the interior could be improved further.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115086562090551812532/reviews

Hazhar Abu Hassan,5,Beautiful mosque. Spacious & very malay kampong style design. Good ammenities. Located near Geylang Serai with Eunos MRT station the nearest.
