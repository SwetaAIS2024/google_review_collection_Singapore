      "text": "Been visiting this stall since the first day\nThe curries for the prata are very tasty.\nThe flavours are rich and right amount of spice. Including the variety of thosai.\n\nSecondly the briyani in this shop, has stopped me from going to Little India to get my briyani fix, cooked in the traditional \"dum\" method, the portion and taste well worth your money.\n\nLastly the \"nasi padang or economic style\" dishes cooked for a meal is quite the spread. Always spoilt for choice. The taste has always been same, since the first day.\n\nProbably once a week, 5 out of 7 days I'll get my meal from this stall. Writing this review as I'm buying food from the stall as well ðŸ˜Š",
