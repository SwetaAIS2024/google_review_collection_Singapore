Sahil knows his stuff and is quite entertaining.",

      "text": "26/6/2024\nSeafood Buffet\n\n- FOOD\nEverything was fresh don‚Äôt get me wrong but most of them were cold dishes or on ice. The only hot dish which was tasty was the Barbequed King Prawn. Hope to see more effort in terms of how the seafood dishes were served e.g. the king crab legs in Chilli/Black Pepper sauce, Lobster Thermidor, etc. Lobster Claws on ice would have been better deshelled before serving with a simple strike & twist with a knife in the kitchen, as we weren‚Äôt given any tools to crack them open.\n\n- SERVICE\nService was alright, just that I was approached one too many times by the servers that wanted to clear my plate while I was still eating. Butter plate on the buffet line was quite a small block which was emptied out quickly, and wasn‚Äôt replenished for the next 30 minutes even after requesting it from one of the managers.\n\n- CONCLUSION\nOverall the food standards in terms of freshness were high, but lacked creativity. Would definitely come back again after the menu improves.",
