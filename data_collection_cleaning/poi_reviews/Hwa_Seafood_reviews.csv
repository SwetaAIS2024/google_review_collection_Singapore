Xinfang,5,Great food at a very reasonable price! Paid $120 for 7 dishes. Service was excellent too. If you’re going it’s better to make reservations cause the tables fill up fast.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101998572816297030823/reviews
M Lee,5,Was there on 11th lunar New Year day. Had some “luo Hey” with some friends. The food was really excellent. Especially the steam chicken dish. Really unique taste of its own. And the fried rice with roasted pork was superb. Overall the taste of this restaurant was great and different from other stir fried regularly elsewhere.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115860197041774564512/reviews

LP Pua,5,"It was our first time dining here, and we were surprised by the crowd at this zichar stall in a quiet industrial estate on a Sunday evening. The two of us ordered Curry Fish Head ($32), Sambal Kangkong ($9.80), and two plates of rice ($1 each). Despite their names, the dishes were not spicy. The taste was good, and the fish was fresh. The service was quick and friendly. We enjoyed the meal and plan to return with family to try their other dishes.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
