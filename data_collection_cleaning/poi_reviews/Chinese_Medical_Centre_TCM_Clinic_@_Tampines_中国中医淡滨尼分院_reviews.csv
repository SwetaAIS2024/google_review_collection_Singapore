Kevin Seow,5,Had back and neck pain for a while. Went for a 1.5 hour rub to loosen the muscles and ease the tension. Made an appointment and Ms Lucky was great. I feel much better after the treatment. She is experienced and is good in identifying problem areas and is skilful. Went to the Tampines Mart outlet for the treatment.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108596558166708505609/reviews

Paisy Loo,5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
On 30 Nov I visited TCM Clinic at Tampines for the second time to have my 60 Min Tui Na for Pain relief / 专项痛症推拿 to address my left arm pain, with my first visit occurring about two months ago. On both occasions, I had the pleasure of being treated by Wendy. She is incredibly patient and professional, taking the time to understand the details of my condition before providing treatment.

After my first session, I was amazed at the improvement—I was finally able to lift my left hand again! Unfortunately, I re-injured it and returned to Wendy for a follow-up treatment today. Once again, I left feeling significantly better and with much less pain. I’m happy to say that I can lift my hand again!

Wendy's expertise and attentive care have made a noticeable difference in my recovery. I highly recommend her services to anyone seeking effective treatment. Thank you, Wendy!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105413265272175922101/reviews
LynZ Tan,5,"I had an amazing experience with this TCM, especially therapist, Anna! Her 推拿 skills are very good, and I felt completely relaxed and refreshed after the session.

What stood out even more was her pleasant personality—she was so friendly and polite throughout. I really appreciated that she wasn’t pushy at all when it came to signing up for packages, she just shared what she needed which made the experience even more enjoyable.

She truly respects her customers' wishes and provides excellent customer service. I will definitely be returning and highly recommend her!

谢谢您安娜❤️🙏",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110741404456067988021/reviews
