Hartono Harjono,4,"A bakery situated in the lower level of Tampines One offers a wide selection of breads and cakes at reasonable prices.  Checkout service is efficient, though the store layout could be improved.  Overall, it is recommended.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102944719141464210600/reviews
YY,4,"Saw a long snaking queue and decided to pop by and see what‚Äôs good, thought it looked like a four leaves replica and can only find this stall name that confirms it.

Chocolate bread was okay, it wasn‚Äôt filled with any filling and was largely just made with chocolate flour.

Their croissants were definitely made different from four leaves though ü•ê

Chocolate horn looks amazing, probably will look to try that next time ü§§",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews

Jiahui Ang,5,Was queuing up carrying my baby with me holding onto a tray of bread and this senior lady (couldnt get her name) came forward and assist me to let me make payment first.
