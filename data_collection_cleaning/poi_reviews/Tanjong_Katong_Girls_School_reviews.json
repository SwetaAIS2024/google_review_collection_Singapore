They respect students privacy. Canteen food not bad just that the food portion are a bit too small. OGL’s are really nice and fun! Overall it’s good.",

The teachers will remind you in a NICE manner when you have a strand of hair unclipped, so for those who said that this school is trash, that's not true! I never regretted joining this school and being a tkgian.",

Overall, i love the school, great teachers and canteen food mostly halal, all nice. I love the wide range of facilities and activities in the school, they make sure it’s not ALL about studying. Loving my seniors, campfire was amazing and y’all should consider choosing this school, it’s great. I especially love the glow up room. Other than my art teacher, it’s all fine, nice classmates and overall learning vibe. TK rocks!",

She moved from fail to A1 the next term thanks to the support from the teachers during the 'drop' in remedial classes. A school that is great today and gets greater with the proactive and supportive management team and teachers.",
