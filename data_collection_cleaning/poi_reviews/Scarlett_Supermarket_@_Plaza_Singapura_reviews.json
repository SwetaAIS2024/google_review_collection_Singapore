The pancakes were excellent ‚Äì crispy, not too oily, and served warm, especially if you go early, around 11 am. The salesperson recommended adding an egg for an extra dollar, which was a great suggestion and enhanced the overall taste.\n\nThe addition of the egg provided a nice richness to the already delicious pancakes. While the food was fantastic, I felt the upsell could be a bit more subtle. Overall, it‚Äôs a great spot for a tasty and satisfying snack.",
