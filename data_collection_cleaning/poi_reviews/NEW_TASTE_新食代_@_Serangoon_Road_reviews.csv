Mabby san,5,"Great value-for-money spot in Boon Keng! The grilled fish is generous in portion and super flavourful only at $14.40â€“ perfect for sharing. Love the $1.99 side dish add-on when you hit the minimum spend, and their traditional barley drink is a must-try.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110477909319370685255/reviews
Eirene SE Lee,5,"Trying the çƒ¤é±¼ for the first time and we loved it. The portion is huge and the fish is so tender with lots of other ingredients, we could barely finish it. We liked it that the soup is not too salty but just nice.

I come here often to eat their tomato egg, cabbage and more.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104504083903266343990/reviews
