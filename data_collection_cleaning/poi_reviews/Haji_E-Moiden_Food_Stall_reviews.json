      "text": "Excellent customer service. Friendly and smiling at all times despite the pressure of the long queue of customers due to their popularity. üëç\n\nBe prepared to be disappointed if you come late as they‚Äôre usually sold out by 10 am.\n\nObjectively, the prata is really good as the dough is freshly made daily (unlike other prata stalls where their dough is bought commercially). It‚Äôs Crispy on the outside and at the same time moist & fluffy. Homemade taste indeed üëçüëçüëç\n\nThe Dalcha gravy that comes along with the prata is also one of the best that I‚Äôve tasted. Not forgetting the dollop of Sambal Tumis that goes so well with this iconic dish.",

Affordable prata with the perfect texture and taste; right amount of crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Add a delicious scoop of sambal on the side, it‚Äôs like an icing on the cake. Staff are very friendly. Highly recommended if you‚Äôre a prata fan!",
