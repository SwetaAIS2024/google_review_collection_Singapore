Kelvin Lim,2,"Bought their new offering, tuna mayo sandwich set that costs $5.40 at base price and $7.50 after changing the drinks to a large iced Kopi C.

Massively disappointed at the amount of tuna mayo the sandwich had for $5.40 (or whatever the ala carte price is). The tuna mayo filling was beyond measly. Not expecting a thick layer of tuna mayo, but this is just taking a piss at your customer. Saving grace is their coffee has been exceedingly consistent.

Maggie Tan,1,"Something is wrong with the design of the cup n the lid. Everytime I drink the coffee, the coffee will leak.  I don't encounter such issue with other take away cup.
Today is worse enough to stain quite a lot on the white top. I have enough of this mess. Will not go again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111429836172330345437/reviews
Grace,2,"We patronised this shop twice (gave it a 2nd chance) and the service was consistently unpleasant both times. However, the food and drinks that we've had so far were alright.

The kitchen staff seems to be in a perpetual bad mood and gives off very unwelcoming vibes.
For example,  when asked ""is there a bag for our takeaway items?"", we received not a verbal reply from the male staff but an annoyed look with a vague hand gesture towards the direction where the plastic bags were located.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115647910829822781707/reviews
