Alison Joy,4,Brilliantly little coffee place next to Lucky Saigon Cafe in the Salvation Army compound. Cute swings as seats to sip away coffee/tea with a cake and ready a book or chat with friends.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102477971098017065179/reviews
Rach Nida,5,This is a tea lovers’ haven with an amazing variety of teas. Tried the jasmine tea from Vietnam based on their recommendation. It’s got a pleasant aftertaste that is quite different from the usual Jasmine tea we get at Chinese restaurants. Enjoyed the tea very much and it goes well with the cake and apple crumble. So glad that we found this place.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103866601411665523804/reviews
Kristine M.A.,5,"We didn’t plan on coming in but saw two very eager dogs calling on us. It’s almost like they’re asking people to “come in!” There’s a wide selection of teas inside with good coffee options too (kopi luwak) and once you’re inside, the dogs won’t really bother you. All they’ll do is keep you company. This place is so cozy and down to earth, nestled in the most unlikely location. Thank goodness we visited!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101977683744019401831/reviews

Jazzmin F,5,"Beautiful concept, friendly owners, most of the patrons are respectful and the noise level isn’t too high. Impressed by their cold tea and how much flavour they extracted. Definitely worth a second visit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100883265521448033277/reviews
