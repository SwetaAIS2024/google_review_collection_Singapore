Nick Qi,4,"An indoor ride (?) with some surprises in store. Like most 4D movie rides, first the audience are  briefed standing in the waiting hall on the backdrop. In this case it's set between Shrek and Shrek 2.

Then into the main theatre where the audience gets to choose motorised seats (ride) or not (no ride).

The movie is good fun, well, anytime when the donkey is involved it's always fun. The motorised seats add some bumps to the road. The extra dimension is provided from nozzles on the top of the seats with smell (nice) and water spray (you disgusting Shrek!).

A good family fun experience.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106798497620017022302/reviews
Luke,4,Fun and interesting story takes about 20 minutes to watch. More suited towards a younger audience. You have to wear 3d glasses which are provided while watching the film to get the effect of things coming out of the screen. There is a seating area for people who don't want moving seats. The queue for here was the shortest in the park while we was there.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105150973468758971062/reviews

Toon Tran,5,"Shrek 4D Adventure at Universal Studios Singapore is a must-see attraction for fans of Shrek and anyone who loves a good laugh! This interactive, multi-sensory show brings the beloved characters to life in a whole new way, taking you on a hilarious journey with Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona.

The experience is more than just a 3D movie—it's 4D! With fun effects like moving seats, gusts of air, and splashes of water, you’re truly immersed in the story and feel like you’re right alongside Shrek and Donkey on their adventure. The effects are well-timed and add so much excitement, making this show entertaining for both kids and adults.

The storyline is funny and family-friendly, filled with Shrek's signature humor and clever dialogue that keeps everyone engaged. The theater itself is cozy and comfortable, with seats that give everyone a good view of the screen.

Shrek 4D Adventure is a delightful break from the thrill rides, offering a fun and immersive experience that captures the spirit of Far Far Away. It’s a wonderful way to spend time with the whole family and enjoy a lighthearted escape into the world of Shrek. Highly recommended for a bit of fairytale fun and laughter!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102078641965155497930/reviews
