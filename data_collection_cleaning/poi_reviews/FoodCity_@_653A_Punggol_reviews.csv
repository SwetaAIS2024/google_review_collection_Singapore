Joe Chin,1,"I want to say I miss the old ban mee, this new stall ubi 350 mee pok and mee tak mak that I ordered was so spicy that's the only flavor that's is for the whole bowl. I know the stall is called 泰姐辣椒面 but still really disappointed if elderly people or young kid want to eat is very difficult for them. Need some improvement.

(no.6 mee pok dry $5.80)the ingredients only have pork slice and meatball.

(No.6A mee tak mak dry $5.80) only have pork liver and meatball.

Other bak chor mee stall at least have fishball, meatball, pork liver, mushroom and fishcake for only $4.80

Would not recommend to others

But can try the porridge that's is right beside the economy rice the porridge is nice and affordable. Really would recommend that.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103600028883830572239/reviews
kiana,5,"Wide variety of food available here, from a 24hours Indian muslim store to claypot rice.

Their chicken rice is probably the best around this area
Would recommend the western store Chef Papa, loved their Sirloin Steak Pasta ($15.90) BIG portion of steak that was as big as my hand and it was cooked really well ( got a Medium Rare)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112924850008305753006/reviews
Ramesh N,3,"Clean and a wide variety of food options coffee shop. Be careful, food sold in the halal Western stall Chef Papa is not worth the price. Tanjong Rhu Wanton noodles and KNS Branch and the rest   of the stores are good for a coffee shop standard.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115967493436495560576/reviews
Tan. W,3,"Just a heads up for anyone looking for coffee during CNY 2025! The coffee stall is open this festive season, but please note there is a surcharge during this period. Make sure you’re prepared for the extra cost.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103022836553318535151/reviews
Russell Tan,1,"Solely made this post for the indian food. For months I put up with their behaviour as their only saving grace is their mutton murtabak and roti john, but they will always up sell and try to push things you don’t want. One second theres no mutton, suddenly there’s mutton available only for a certain dish. They will say Mutton Murtabak only have large size, no regular size, what kind of logic is that???

Price says 6 for Nasi Goreng, will push for chicken nasi goreng for $8. I insist on ikan bilis nasi goreng, with egg, dish ends up with just nasi goreng and egg and some chilli ketchup. plain, bland, nothing good. Avoid at all cost.

You tell me, looks good?",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108456852147688712469/reviews
