Barely visible to be honest.\n\nTheir customer support team was responsive, friendly, and helpful throughout the entire process. They answered all my questions, provided timely updates on my order, and even followed up after delivery to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase. The level of care and attention they showed me as a customer was truly impressive, and it's clear that they're committed to providing an exceptional customer experience.\n\nI'm impressed with the quality and value of the watch film from them. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and effective watch protector!",
