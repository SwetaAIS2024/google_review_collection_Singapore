Aqila Khalid,5,"Brought my K2 children here for a field trip. We had an amazing time at the children's pizza workshop! The host, Rina was fantasticâ€”friendly, engaging, and really made the kids feel comfortable and excited about making their own pizzas. The activity was both fun and interactive, with each child getting hands-on experience to roll out dough, add toppings, and even shape their pizzas. It was the perfect balance of creativity and learning, and the best part was that everything was tailored to be age-appropriate. The kids were able to follow along easily and really enjoyed the process. Highly recommend this workshop for any young pizza enthusiasts!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109504828553214704773/reviews
