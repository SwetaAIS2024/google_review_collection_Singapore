Zhai Zi Run,1,they have two cockatoos left unattended outdoors in the hot weather with only tiny containers of water - you can see that the birds are even panting because they’re overheating. this is not normal or acceptable! no one was around in the shop either to bring them into a cooler environment.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114537399950100425615/reviews
Emily Schlumberger,1,"Animal abuse! I just visited the shop and was shocked by the condition of the two birds outside. I talked to the staff and asked them to please change it. The birds are tied by a short metal string on a metal bar. They can barely move. They are both showing an intense behavorial disorder and are loudly crying for help.
I would never buy anything from these animal abusers. This shop should be cancelled or reported to the police immediately if nothing changes for the birds.
Greetings from Emily, I hope you passed on my complaint to the shop owner.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103336809216080705023/reviews
Joan,1,"Walking past this shop makes me fuming mad. It is raining and the poor bird was outdoor struggling and trying to bite off the metal chain that was chained to its legs. It goes to show how badly it has been treated and it can’t wait to break free. Owner’s response to other reviewers: “it is important to get natural and full spectrum of sunlight.” Yes it is important, but not the whole day????? You do know weather is so hot lately right? I could barely stand in the heat for 5 mins, and yet the bird has been out the whole time. If it is essential, maybe the owner shouldn’t sit inside the aircon room. Come on and work outdoors with the poor birds to get the natural and full spectrum sunlight (or rain) as you have mentioned.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110085324452627793385/reviews
Ju Li,2,"As a bird owner’s point of view, bird can be left outdoor for awhile but not a whole day, especially under the big hot sun.
Hot air under the umbrella can cause too much heat for them.

Jason Goh,5,"Joined the louts family for almost 1 yr plus was introduced by my bro in law and sister. Lotus staffs and clients are like one big family. Mr Kan & Cola are very friendly and always ready to help lots of positivity and energy whenever i visit the shop. I started off with my first jadeite pendant. After wearing it can see some changes and improvement on luck even strike 4D twice last year. Just early this year got my second item sandalwood and also review of our annual fengshui. So far so good, things has been rather smooth sailing. Hopefully more people can benefit from it!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110681917529632165979/reviews
