Jessy Liong,5,"The food was delicious and full of flavor. The Tom Yum soup was spicy and fresh. The fried rice was tasty, and the shrimp cakes were crispy. Everything was well-cooked and nicely presented.

The price was very affordable for the quality and portion sizes. The service was quick.

Highly recommend this place! Will definitely come again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106778436449593814438/reviews
Dave Ng,3,"Well acceptable Thai cuisine available in the heartland, very conveniently located. We ordered three dishes and find that the braised pork knuckles is the best. One of the service crew can speak mandarin.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102670815999657293644/reviews
Ms J. Low,5,"Very good authentic Thai food in this down-to-earth eatery at Ang Mo Kio Ave 10. Prices are reasonable, like coffeeshop price. We enjoyed the Pineapple Fried Rice, Stir Fried Vegetable, Steamed Seabass, Green Curry Prawn and Red Ruby dessert. Also the special dish Braised Pork Knuckle. We chose mainly the non-spicy dishes which are kids-friendly.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107553289974763437889/reviews

C Neil,1,"This will be my last visit to this restaurant. The male cashier’s attitude was shockingly poor—he even went out of his way to give me 18 dimes as change.

From the start, we waited nearly an hour, we were served just two dishes: a mango salad and an omelet with only three shrimp. Then tom yum soup had barely any ingredients, and when I brought it up, his response was dismissive: “I gave it to you for free. If you’re unhappy, that’s not my problem.”

Such blatant disregard for customers speaks volumes!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116572242474151595993/reviews
