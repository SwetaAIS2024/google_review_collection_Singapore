Many staff were still stocking up the shelves when the store opened.\n\nThere are many items on offer and I managed to get the chocolates at $0.69 instead of $2.75 and the coffee ground which has a reasonable expiry of a little more than one month was at half price of $8.45.\n\nI could not find a trolley, and I was directed to one. The cashier was all smiles, asked for Yuu rewards and assisted me to pack my items into my bag. She immediately scanned the heavily items so that I could bag at the bottom first.",

Please DFI, look into your staffing to have more manpower during lunch time, or don't have the deli section opened. It was fully decked out with food but no staff to serve.",
