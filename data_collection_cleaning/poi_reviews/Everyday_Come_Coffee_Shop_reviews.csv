Xavier Tan,3,"Food is pretty average. Donâ€™t be fooled by the picture of the curry fish head, the fish head is quite small and sunk below the vegetables.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106885978605096751111/reviews
CK CK,5,The mixed rice stall having promotion 2veg 1 meat at $2 & 2meat 1veg at $2.50. Itâ€™s not all dishes part of the promo as usual. If you choose certain meats or veg it will cost more. Better ask before assuming. My takeaway today was at $4 but worth a lot as I got almost the whole of a chicken drumstick with 2veg. Generous portion!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112703430868755541581/reviews
Edwin Cheng,5,"The service was extremely quick and staff were very attentive.
Food was really good as well.
Place was slightly warm in the afternoon even with air conditioning, but the good food and service will help you forget about it.
Price is also very reasonable.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106652073746891712280/reviews
Syazzy Slackster,5,"The A1 Family Ayam Goreng & Western Food half spring fried chicken with fries transcended mere sustenance. It was a symphonyâ€”an edible sonata composed by a chef who understood the art of balance. As I wiped the last smudge of garlic aioli from my plate, I vowed to return. Spring or not, this dish had etched itself into my culinary memory.

The chicken chop is great too.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102076384806910813344/reviews
Fluffy Koala,5,"JEWELâ€™S ROJAK

The best rojak in Tampines forreal!! ðŸ¥¹

Her stall operates from around 3pm onwards, however it seems like she works on her own schedule. You are lucky if you catch her! ðŸ˜…

Damn fragrant, super solid!

Enjoy your rojak!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109765195966590920930/reviews
