Mico Lim,5,"As a working mom, I always worried about my children well being, whether they are in good hands, stay happy, healthy and can learn some good values when I’m busy with my work. I can’t thank the teachers, educators and the staff at Haven Schoolhouse enough for their passion and thoughtfulness in taking care / teaching my kids. I can entrust them and hence able to focus on work during weekdays. My children look forward to go to school everyday! Thank you teachers and aunties once again!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106708729029806069053/reviews
