Patrick Yong,1,Bad experience. Took my 2nd sinopharm dose and was told i can take less than 3 weeks. After that MOH didn't update my vaccination status as it is less than 3 weeks. Make an appeal and told them the clinic allows less than 3 weeks as they need to convert back to cosmetic clinic. Waste alot of my time and they are not responsible for what they did. Did a complaint to MOH on them. VEry disappointed with the clinic and their staff. Never apologise till now.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101849934977959153722/reviews
#tiotiotio Fishing,1,Made an appointment with one of the staff on Sunday 9am. She said it was open on that day so I went ahead to book a slot for my 3rd covid jab. Went down for it and realized that they were not open. I texted the staff and she said they will be opening so gave them awhile. I waited for 30mins and still no one showed up. Very disappointed in the clinic. Never going there again.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113814443595061293451/reviews
