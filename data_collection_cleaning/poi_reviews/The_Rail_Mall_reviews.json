      "text": "To Rail Mall management: Observation about the new Burger King at Rail Mall, especially with the existing one so close by at HillV2. It does seem a little \"me too\" given the proximity. McDonald's, were they considered? Or rejected your invite?\n\nHoping Rail Mall will aim for a more diverse tenant mix in the future, something that complements rather than directly competes with what's already available just across the road at HillV2. That makes a lot of sense in terms of offering shoppers a wider range of options and making Rail Mall a more unique destination.\n\nAnother similarity: CS Fresh at HillV2 and Cold Storage at Rail Mall. Consider bringing in NTUC Fair Price when Cold Storage lease runs out.\n\nJust my feedback into consideration for future tenant selections.",
