      "text": "Buangkok Square bus stop is conveniently located near the heart of the neighborhood, providing easy access to the nearby mall, supermarket, and hawker centre. It’s a useful stop for residents and commuters heading towards the MRT or connecting to other parts of the area.\n\nHowever, the bus stop could benefit from better seating and shelter. During heavy rain, the shelter isn’t wide enough to protect from the wind and splashing water. On hot days, the limited shade can make waiting uncomfortable.\n\nIt would also be helpful to have more frequent bus updates or a digital display showing bus arrival times, as the current information boards aren’t always accurate.\n\nOverall, it serves its purpose well, but a few improvements could make the experience much better for regular commuters.",
