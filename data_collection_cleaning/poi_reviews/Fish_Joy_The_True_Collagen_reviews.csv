Wong,4,Ordered double fish soup and mackerel soup to share. I like the fried egg. Fish tasted fresh but soup was so-so,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117371414634904431515/reviews
Stanley Fong,4,"Found this food stall in a coffeeshop that served yummy collagen fish soup. It‚Äôs at Block 168, Toa Payoh Lorong 1. I ordered their best-selling Red Grouper Collagen Fish Soup (S$10) plus a bowl of rice($0.50). They are slightly different from regular fish soup and the queue can be a bit long during meal time.
Update on Dec 2023, they have change the menu and the price has increased slightly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103990023797820704361/reviews
Yan Ting Tan,1,"Wanted to order their clear soup but they say it‚Äôs not available.
Ordered the 2in1 with collagen broth which comes with fried fish and another dory fish looking kind. Soup has no umami, is kinda like carton collagen broth that‚Äôs poorly seasoned. definitely not like what the initial reviews, seems like it‚Äôs taken over by a Chinese lady. Ordered 2 of the same bowls but one clearly had a lot less soup.
Quality of the fish and soup is disappointing for this price.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112140701362127749613/reviews
Aaron Zane,4,"Ordered the 2 in 1 collagen fish soup (both fried and sliced fish)

found it a little pricey for fish soup $7.50 including rice
but after eating I think it‚Äôs still alright for the ingredients

service was a bit slow as the staff can only cook 2 pots at a time

overall the taste was not bad, could taste the collagen flavour in the soup

would come back again if i was in the area and craving for fish soup",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106234685555583809967/reviews
Pamela Lam,5,"Came here upon recommendation by friends! Their red grouper collagen fish soup is üëçüèª Very tasty with natural sweetness, fish is fresh and love the seaweed topping as well. My hushand had the teochew style steam grouper which was equally good. Highly recommended if you‚Äôre in the area!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101857651194332817338/reviews
