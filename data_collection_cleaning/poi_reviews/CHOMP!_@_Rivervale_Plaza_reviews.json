I love that the rice comes with plenty of wonderful curry gravy. The laksa here is also nice but has slightly over powering taste of dried shrimp.\nThe coffee and tea here were very good. The Kaya butter toast here is super crispy and nice. Probably the best that I had.\nService here can be friendlier.",

There are also many traditional dishes to choose from, and it‚Äôs a great place for breakfast and afternoon tea. It‚Äôs truly very convenient. The staff work hard and are very polite.",

      "text": "I frequent here every week, and the food is great with decent portions for the price. Their kaya toast set is currently just $4.80 compared to $6.40 at Ya Kun.\n\nHowever, the time taken to order might deter customers especially during the weekends. It might not seem long, but you can spend up to 15 minutes waiting to order even if you are next in-line. I‚Äôve seen customers leaving the queue because no crew was available to take the order.\n\nNo discredit to the crew as they are working hard to clear earlier orders but something for the management to think about in terms of having additional headcount or to pause the delivery orders when there is a backlog. There are just 2-3 staff working in the store on a peak Saturday morning and that is definitely not sufficient.",

I don‚Äôt see a sign put up to return your trays after meal.\nFood is served shortly after payment.\nChicken üêì cutlet rice is a mixed review of crisp tasty chicken but veg & gravy is not warm at all. At $6.90 I think for the portion served is more enough for 1 pax.\nThe laksa at $4.90 I think it can skipped. Gravy is not thick & lacked flavor.",
