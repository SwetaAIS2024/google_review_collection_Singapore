Ars 3276,3,"Staff just threw rice on the table causing the spill as per pict 4.
Other than this, the dishes were good.

Been a regular here for quite some time so know the various Roast meats n are pretty good.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114029124935079806014/reviews
Cynthia,5,"When i think of Toa Payoh, i find myself craving for the Char Siew Roast Pork Hor Fun that comes with bean sprout & i got additional green veggies on it! For $7 for a whole meal without an MSG reaction, it is definitely a treat for me!! I just have to abstain the soup just in case ☺️. Oh i should end that i come early but i see lots of folks taking away too! I am glad that the servers speak English too though they start with Mandarin always!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114735938830883821698/reviews
Andrew Goh,2,Roasted pork skin was not crispy at all and the meat was tough. The char siew is dry & hard. Both are not succulent. So disappointed ☹️,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113082254894756875696/reviews
Hazel Nguyen,1,"The worst service in Singapore I have ever gotten. The staff is so stupid. Other customers are served with chopstick and spoon at once. But we got 1 spoon and 1 fork for both. And other staff rushed us to order even we just did stand far away to look at menu, and how we can order drink without seeing the menu?",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116272669424818783714/reviews
Chan “Toffees” Allen,3,"Review 2017, 5 stars
Been eating here each week for past 3 months. Variety of food options from Duck, char siew, sio bak, chicken rice, wanton mee and more. Great service from each and everyone except 1 old uncle.

Review 2018, 3 stars
Service is not as good as in 2017. Sometimes they will ignore you even you waited at their stall. Always failed to provide what I asked for, extra chilli despite telling and reminded twice each time I ordered. They simply ignored my requests. I have stopped patronize since. The only thing they are good at are asking you for payment first.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110097176985965725951/reviews
