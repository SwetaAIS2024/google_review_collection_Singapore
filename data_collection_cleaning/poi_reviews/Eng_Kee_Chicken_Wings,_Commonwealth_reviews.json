Goes well with the noodles and chicken wings. üòã\n\nYou can also dine in for your meal and enjoy a bit of nostalgic Singapore.\n\nRecommended!\n\nüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüòã",

Like everyone said here, the fried chicken wings are the best. We managed to get the hot and crispy fried fish fillet.\n\nService by the store is fantastic and he's well mannered.\n\nFor 2 normal sized plates of noodles, 4 chicken wings, 1 fillet and 1 ngor hiong, it's only $11.40!\n\nWill return again!",

The rest are not as tastier as in the past. Beehoon not cooked well so very tough. The cabbage is very sweet instead of fragrance. The otah still ok but not spicy. The fish cake and luncheon meat is standard off shelf. So this may probably my last visit to my old memory food place. I paid sgd6.50. Their off day is Sunday. Close at 8pm",

      "text": "A great chicken wing - Nothing less, nothing more\n\nWas walking past to eat the (more superior) Ah Kee Beef Noodles. Decided to get one chicken wing ($1.60) for a bite to see the hype.\n\nThe temperature was slightly warm, wished it could have been piping hot but I guess this is the nature of economic bee hoon where the dishes are left out on display, so I consider myself blessed.\n\nWith the first bite, there was a capture of a great taste and a slight heat releasing from the wing itself. While the chicken wing was tasty, I couldn't help but consider the lack of distinction this chicken wing had. I can tell its a great chicken wing, but I cant necessarily tell its an Eng Kee chicken wing.\n\nOverall while I enjoyed the bite, at $1.60; Would I consider coming over from Commonwealth MRT to eat the beehoon here with the chicken wing? Maybe. However, to queue for a while? That would be a no.",
