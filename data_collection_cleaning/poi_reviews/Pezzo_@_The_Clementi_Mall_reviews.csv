T Yap,1,"The pizzas themselves are great. We always love their flavours.

The staff at this outlet? Not so great. In fact, bad. When it came to our family's turn, the staff took our order, and when we said we didn't want the offer, just punched in the order with a frown. Staff continued punching in other orders, making us wait for a while before she prepared our order and just dumped it on the counter top without a word.

Hope you can train your staff better. Yes, F&B is not easy and full salutes to them- but neither is it easy seeing your staff make customers wait for no good reason. We are not asking for a red carpet, just basic courtesy - yet that's not there.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106615316700213072040/reviews

navin pillai,1,The staff can get the order wrong after pointing and reading out loud what’s wanted at this place. Blows my mind.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108316237540232942527/reviews
Sharon CM Poo,1,"Super rude staff (a guy working - on Thursday 11 January 2024 about 7.10pm) Queued at the Order Here area for about 5 mins And line starts to form behind but there’s a family at the “collection point” area so some people queued behind them afterwards.

Instead of rectify which customers came first or manage the queue , the staff just look at me when it’s my turn “Queue starts from the other side” (of those people who just came)

Totally speechless , you have two other staffs doing nothing when the queue starts to form and yet you just let the queue forms and says it’s the wrong side ???

What a turn off of appetite",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106376869641436344519/reviews
