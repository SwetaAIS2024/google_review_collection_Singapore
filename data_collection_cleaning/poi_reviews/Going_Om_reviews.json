While the drink selection is somewhat limited, particularly the beer options, the snacks exceeded my expectations. The pani puri and the platter we ordered were both delightful. I would definitely return for another quick drink and bite.",

Pani puri and fried mushrooms are a must try. The rest of the foods great too. The manager surprised us with a slice of cake and candle to wish happy birthday to my friends daughter. He had overheard us talking about her birthday.\nThe cake is delicious. Vegan red velvet cake with beetroot. Moist soft and not too sweet. Tasted better than normal red velvet cake! Thank you for making it memorable night. :)",
