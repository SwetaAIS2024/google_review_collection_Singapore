      "text": "Found this hidden gem tucked just outside Paya Lebar Square, serving up authentic Japanese ramen and gyoza. Tried all three of their soup bases: 1) the tonkotsu was rich, creamy, and deeply satisfying, 2) the miso was salty, umami-packed, and incredibly comforting, and 3) the shoyu had a light sweetness with bold soy flavor‚Äîclean and refreshing. The gyoza were crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside, and bursting with savory goodness. Portions are generous, noodles cooked to al dente perfection, and each bowl comes with huge, tender slices of pork. Bonus points for the free flow of hard-boiled eggs and crunchy bean sprouts. A solid spot for a hearty, satisfying meal that hits all the right notes. The only downside? Expect a short wait during peak hours‚Äîbut it‚Äôs well worth it.",

The prices are reasonable and comes with complimentary free flow bean sprouts (for that daily veggie intake) and hard boiled eggs. The soup base is made richer and more intense by the Japanese owner to cater for local taste. It‚Äôs definitely one of our favorite ramen, that surpass even some of the popular ramens in Japan. With over 10 outlets across the island now, there is no longer a need to queue.",

Have the selection for different taste like less salty, noodle hardness, oil level... And the rare salmon katsu is so good, must try. Overall a nice eating experience.",
