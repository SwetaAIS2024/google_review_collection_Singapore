Kah Wang Tan,4,"Came on a weekday lunch time and it was a 30 mins queue probably because it’s a new hawker and everyone is eager to check them out. The chicken wing was well marinated, juicy, tender but not too oily. It was relatively big as well.

As for the beehoon, it wasn’t that bad and goes well with the chili. What I like is the portion was big.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117624172714283499367/reviews
Glen,5,"A popular stall and I understood the long queue. However, the queue shortens within seconds as the replenishing of ingredients were fast! I was behind at least 10 people and yet the boss was taking my order within 7minutes. Worth the wait! It’s cheap and freshly cooked!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106919239285712162809/reviews
Candy Tan,2,"It was a 30-35 min wait over a Sunday and I thought it should be delicious, looking at the Queue.

Then I realised it’s cox of one staff packing hence the wait. And a female cashier excitedly engaging conversation with either ex staff or staff from other outlets.

I pack 5 wings and the aroma filled my car.

The skin is crispy with slight hint of marination. As I bite into it, the flesh is a bit tough and bland. The chili is definitely not spicy but very salty. The chef might have mistakenly put more salt than chili.

Overall, I would not Q again for this stall unless other outlets prove otherwise.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117328827398638986001/reviews
