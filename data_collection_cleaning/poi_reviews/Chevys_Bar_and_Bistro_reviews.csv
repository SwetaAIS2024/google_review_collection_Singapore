Aleks Uverski,5,"a family atmosphere will give you a sanctuary feeling in crowded district.
10 year’s anniversary celebrated on 10.June!
Vintage environment, friendly staff, good selection of drinks and bar food. Not to forget affordable prices ;) a classic western bar with a touch of Asia.
Cheers!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115524407010806070121/reviews
Tony Lalor,5,"This is an amazing bar, we were looking for that place away from the rat race, and walking past, we felt like this was the place. Before we knew it, we had a few pints on the table and had fantastic meals. Had to go back a few times. Great place and a must-see place.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102133946891558823674/reviews
Shar C,5,Lovely place with absolutely banging pints of Guinness (the wine is very decent as well). Seems to attract a lot of older regulars & the music selection was great! Only downside I would say is the one bathroom stall shared by men & women.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112411831297856109318/reviews
