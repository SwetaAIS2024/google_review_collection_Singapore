KY,1,"Tried this chicken hot pot place recently, and honestly, it was one of the worst food experiences we've had in a long time. First off, the price – $7.50 for dine-in and $7.80 for takeaway – might sound okay at first glance, but for what you get? It's a joke. The portion was pathetic. Barely any ingredients, just a sad splash of broth with some scattered bits trying to pass as a meal. Felt more like a side dish than an actual meal.

Now, the service – or complete lack of it – was another disaster. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes. We were patient. But when we checked back after 15 minutes, the person in charge casually threw out another “15 minutes” with no apology, just excuses. Not even a hint of customer service. It felt like they just say whatever to get you off their back.

This place seriously lacks value and respect for customers' time and money. Save your $7.50 and go get something that doesn’t leave you annoyed, hungry, and ripped off. Never again.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107627862325395589882/reviews
Pauline Chua,5,"Tired of 8889 chicken pot?? NEVER. be it a raining day or a happy day, sad to even an emo day.....8889 chicken pot will definitely come to ur mind!

Been a returning customer since they reopened their AMK branch after covid. Choosing the flavour depending on the mood....Drunkard still our top choice, follow by Gong Bao (choice of spice level) and collagen (must try for 1st timer!) Still waiting?

Oh from 12pm to 4pm, they serve mini hot pot for 1 pax too!

Head down to their Owen branch at blk 44 Owen road and get a free plate upon google review. Enjoy n feedback if any.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107817769487701743166/reviews

Beelicious Belle,5,The soup is not as thick (watery) as the other brands but the flavour gets better as you boil the soup and add more ingredients … taste is quite flavourful but can improve further … chilli is good!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110407713963145789109/reviews
