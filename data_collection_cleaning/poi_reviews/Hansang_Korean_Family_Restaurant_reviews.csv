Aim Alastair,3,"Jokbal (Pork Throttle) was a good n flavorful dish. Seafood pancake was ordinary, and only crispy on the outer side of the pancake. For the price they’re charging, the amount of seafood is certainly a let down. Pork Bulgogi was tender and bold but a tad too sweet for our liking. Tasted both versions of Makgeolli, we preferred the sparkling over the traditional non sparkling version. Overall the food is Authentic but the prices are slightly high. The potions are too big for dinners to order more dishes to try/ share. It’ll be a great ideal to bring down the portions n prices at the same time, so that dinners can order more varieties of dishes to share around, like in many other Korean Restaurants. It didn’t live up to our expectations of such high Google reviews.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114728704006135338132/reviews
Travis Lee,5,"Hansang serves truly authentic Korean food. Be prepared that the waiting time may be long, even when the queue is short. Although the prices are slightly higher, the generous portions justify the cost, especially when you opt for one of the many promotional sets. The food were very tasty, although we would prefer bolder flavours. The lady owner was very friendly. While free items were given for leaving Google review, this honest review didn’t take advantage of the offer.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114317766905567101774/reviews
Jacob TAN,3,"We booked this place for a birthday celebrations. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the high Google review. The quality of the pork and beef were not good. The service staff were very busy and rush with their service. The ginseng chicken was so so only. The saving grace was the banchan which had good variety and taste. The Korean owners were service oriented and friendly.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
M P,4,"1st visit

They have nice gukbap and portion is quite good

Find the kimchi soup not too bad but not my favourite

I like their kimchi which is the fresh version that’s abit less sour

2nd visit

The kimchi fried rice comes with meat and cheese though I find the rice taste abit bland. The marinated pork also so so too

Also tried the bbq chicken set. Bean paste soup is not bad though abit bland with no meat taste. I find th  bbq chicken too burnt and they were very nice to change. Second batch is better but I find the bbq meat so so.

I didn’t like their barley tea as it seem to taste off but i do for kimchi which is the fresh kimchi kind",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112908652574347918174/reviews
Min Hui Lim,5,"Ordered their jjamppong and was pleasantly surprised. Although their version does not have any wok hey, the taste of seafood is very prominent, which is what I preferred anyway! Not spicy at all too, so it was a very comforting meal :’) bonus to the friendly owner whom we had a great chat with~",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113749500894354859785/reviews
