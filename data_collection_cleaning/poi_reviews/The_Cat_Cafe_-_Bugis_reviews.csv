Seri Mustika Md Nor,5,"We visited around 12.20pm on 21 January 2025, so the cats were asleep. But the hospitality from the staffs were top notch. I like how they were able to make small talks with us because the cats were asleep, so we had to entertain ourselves. And the drinks are so good! I had the cafe latte, and i know it sounds basic but I really enjoyed my time here. ü´∂üèΩ",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100139984476348808047/reviews

Carlo Miranda,5,"Cat therapy at its finest. Not rushed, not swamped with cats, but just enough to see them in their relaxed home environment. They even put up a guide for cat preferred locations to pat, which people must agree to following as the cats have their likes and dislikes. There's also a safe retreat area for cats not in the mood for patting and gawking. Meanwhile the food is prepared nicely and the staff are incredibly patient and kind to foreigners.
I went here with my newly-wed wife who recommended we go here. It is pleasing to anyone with need of cat-therapy.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114915238620575760104/reviews
H,5,"went around 7pm but most were sleeping except for a few (there was also one short point of time all of them were sleeping at the same time). however near closing time, most cats starts waking up lol. you can sip on coffee as you watch the cats.

chill and friendly staff, nice ambiance, peaceful and there was not much crowd. the window view is nice.
