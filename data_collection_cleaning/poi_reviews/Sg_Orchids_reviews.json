      "text": "Very nice orchid farm with beautiful flowers and helpful staff. The kind uncle helped to advise us on the flower arrangement and choice, and on selecting an appropriate pot. In arranging the flower he also consulted our opinions and gave advice on how to care for the flowers. 1 week on and my pot of orchids are healthy and happy, with 2 new shoots that have just appeared. Price is really reasonable, would highly recommend a visit! Do take note that some of their flowers have been pre-ordered, so you may not have a huge selection, but the remaining flowers that are available are still really beautiful.",
