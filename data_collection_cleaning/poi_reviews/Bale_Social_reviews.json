The atmosphere was fantastic, with the empty golf park providing a serene background and a gentle natural breeze keeping us cool.\nWhile food selection wasn‚Äôt extensive, it offere ample choice for small gatherings. It‚Äôs an ideal spot to enjoy a beer and some lite bite with your close one. We particularly appreciated their unique fusion of western and Indian flavours, which add a special touch.",

The creamy chicken pasta is a fusion dish using curry leaves and spices. The combination is a bit odd but the thing that threw me off is the use of fresh onion in pasta.  ü§¢ the service is quite slow as well. Have to wait for half an hour despite there being only 2 other guests.\nOverall it's hard to justify a long journey here for food.",
