Eve C,3,Very nice centre in the middle of the garden. Provide rich information on the subject by theme. A pity the videos were not working at time of visit. Most information are static and not interactive. Good to visit if you are keen in ethnobotany.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews
Forest BK,5,"A beautiful Colonial era house located at the top of the hill exhibiting South East Asian indigenous tribe's handicrafts, tools, musical instruments and artifacts in an air-conditioned environment with clean toilets. Admission is free.
Surprised to find a ""sheng"" among the musical instruments displayed.
A great learning experience. Highly recommended to visit the Centre.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews

L L,5,I was walking around Botanic Gardens and came across a flight of stairs that led to here. No entrance fee is required. The place isn't crowded. They have toilet on every floor. The contents in this museum are very educational. You learn about the type of plants and their purposes in Singapore. I recommend coming here if you want to learn something new.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112783414876414905670/reviews
Eva Dzjubo,5,"This place is amazing and an absolute must visit if you're in the area, it teaches so many interesting things about indigenous communities, plants and how we interact with them. It's so amazing, I can't believe they have made it for free for everyone. 100% worth your time if you love nature!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114185613295610756060/reviews
