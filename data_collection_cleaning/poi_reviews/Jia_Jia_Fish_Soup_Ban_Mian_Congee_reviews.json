      "text": "Tried fish soup from here after seeing its positive reviews but really shocked with my order. I got fish head soup for takeaway; just the soup without noodles or rice, it was $6 (not even sure if that’s the correct price because it would be the same price with noodles). When I got back home I realised there are about 6-7 chunks but there was no meat at all. About 4 chunks were eyeballs (seriously?) and others were really just bones without meat. Any meat that I could scrap was the little reddish fishy kind surrounding the eyeball which I could not stomach. Really disappointing. I basically paid $6 for half a bowl of soup, with 2 small slices of tomato and 1-2 small slices of tofu. Ridiculous…",
