Kennigrace,4,"I really enjoyed the set meal ($15.91). It is valued for money and so tasty.

My favourite part is the side house-made tofu, so soft and umami with minced meat gravy.

The chicken thigh is tender. It contains a bit of soft bones but no issue for me.

The chilli sauce is good too, enough kick but not overly spicy.

I would definitely eat here again if I am in the area. Recommended!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110647431375132068965/reviews
Paradise Ng,3,Overall good dining experience. Was wondering what's the purpose of having the selection for choosing remove bones and skin when it is served as per normal with the bones and skin intact? The staffs are friendly and greeted the entering and exiting customer.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111064481968582247479/reviews
michie swee chen,3,"Decided to get the chicken rice from Five Star today since we were nearby. We ordered roasted chicken rice, white chicken wing rice and Thai tofu.

Let‚Äôs review first in the tofu
- it‚Äôs fried to perfection with sweet Thai chilli sauce.
- it‚Äôs yummy but must eat while it‚Äôs piping hot üòã
- abit pricy for 4 small pieces of tofu, not value for $$$

The roasted chicken is acceptable though nothing special to note about. They given me breast meat and luckily it‚Äôs not as tough as I thought.
The white chicken wing wasn‚Äôt de-bone to our surprised but it tasted quite ok.
We were disappointed with the rice, soft but not fragrant as in other chicken rice stall.
The chilli for the chicken rice is tasty & spicy ang guess that makes the food abit tastier.

Will I visit again? Perhaps not so soon. There are many places that sell better chicken rice than them üòù",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106705193569837442809/reviews
Jason Ong,3,"Five star chicken rice has been around for quite a while, and used to be very popular. Unfortunately, I feel that the food now is not quite up to par. The roast chicken was so-so, the broccoli was not bad, but the fish soup was very bland. As they are located along a stretch of road of eateries, they will need to up their game if they want to stay competitive.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews
Julian Seow,5,"I love chicken rice so much, best Singapore food. Roasted chicken was nice, tender and juicy, goes really well with the chilli sauce that is provided. Nice to come with a bigger group to try their other dishes. I liked the cereal prawn, and the hometown tofu is also usually really good too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102992432674241965160/reviews
