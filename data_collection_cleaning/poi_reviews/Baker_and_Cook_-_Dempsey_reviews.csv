Dylan C.,5,"A beautiful spot tucked away in Dempsey, perfect for slow mornings and great bread. We came for the new brunch menu and were genuinely impressed — every dish is anchored by their 37-year-old sourdough starter (Little Johnny), giving everything from the bread board to the Dutch Baby Pancake an artisanal touch. The sourdough pasta with seafood was a standout, and the leafy, relaxed setting made it a joy to linger. Warm service, thoughtful food, and a menu that’s both comforting and elevated. Highly recommend!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108694546346754342269/reviews
Tze Shyang Foo,3,"Ordered their recommended burger, Holy Smoke . It's more like Holy-dry.. the patty although was thick but it's so dry that it felt more like I'm eating meat loaf. .
The pastas were also too salty... overall a disappointment.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105721113980454545725/reviews
Joanna Gabriel,5,"The most beautiful Baker & Cook location I've been to and with the biggest menu selection! I had the chorizo hash, juice, and got an almond cake to take home. Everything was beautifully prepared, and you cannot get better windows and light in a cafe than here! Helpful and efficient staff too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109807846443059956622/reviews
Joey Heng,3,"Food was not worth the price paid.  Portion of food was unexpectedly underwhelming. $25 for a plate like that I would expect the meat portion to be more generous and packed; rather than what I’m getting as can be seen in the picture. Also, this plate of Rueben sandwich with truffle fries was extremely oily as you can see on the plate. Honestly, would not return and would not order this again as portion was disappointing.

Can see that they don’t focus on food here but just rely on the atmosphere and surrounding area to hopefully attract customers as this is Dempsey area.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111970487349656972864/reviews

I absolutely love visiting Baker & Cook Dempsey! The staff are always so warm and welcoming, and they even remember my coffee order every time—such a personal touch!
The pastries are always fresh and delightful, and their pizza is just as amazing. It’s the perfect spot to relax, enjoy great food, and feel right at home.
