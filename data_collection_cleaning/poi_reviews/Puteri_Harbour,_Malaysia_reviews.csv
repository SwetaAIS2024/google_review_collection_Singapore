K9 Training Centre and Kennels,4,"We went as the sun was setting,so it looked quiet ,but waterfront became busy after a while.

Jeroemy,5,"Always a pleasure to visit the Marina at Puteri Harbour. You can take a nice stroll around the perimeter of the Marina. I visited a couple of times a few years back before covid, and back in 2015.

Just visited recently in 2024, and was shocked to find out that most shops & F&Bs have closed for about a year now - all started when hotel Jen shut its operations. The entire bustling area where hotel Jen used to be is now a ghost town. All the shops have closed down permanently, was a little sad to find out as the area was really nice.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113002867544321957411/reviews
hayley,4,"The wind therr is strong , which is really relaxing and helps me to blow off some steam ðŸ¤Ž there's lots of food stalls as well there, but the price is not really reasonable and the hygiene conditions were a bit concerning ... My fam and I didn't eat there, but the place was quite a vibe ! Will suggest you to go when it's a bit later , maybe around 7-8 pm to enjoy the night performances ! Overall nice place to walk around and enjoy the breeze ~",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110914349626905425666/reviews
