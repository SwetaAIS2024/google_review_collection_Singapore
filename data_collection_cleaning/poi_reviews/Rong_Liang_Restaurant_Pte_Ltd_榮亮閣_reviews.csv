C.C Quah,5,"Discovered an amazing eatery while searching for dinner. Priced modestly+ nice food+ friendly staff = winning combo!
In Singapore, where prices rival skyscraper heights, we stumbled upon a culinary miracle: refunded $2.50 for a sold-out soup, where to find? ðŸ˜‚
Definitely going back! 5/5 stars.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116254700547999874013/reviews
Alvin Choo,4,"Have been eating their food for a long time now, but I usually get it as takeaway. The roast pork and char siew rice was always a cheap and delicious meal, but this time I got the roast duck as well. I also had the salted vegetable duck soup but I thought this was quite average compared to others which I have tried.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
W8ll8am Gastby S8m,2,"Used to come here when I was young and also when I married and brought my children.

I think the standard taste drops a lot. The meat tastes frozen.

The only thing that still tastes constant is the sauce.

A sad day indeed.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101069809328749995510/reviews
