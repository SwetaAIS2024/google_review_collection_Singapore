      "text": "I can't say enough positive things about Maplebear Rochdale! It has truly been a wonderful experience for my 3 years old boy who is attending school for the first time. Their approach of learning through play is not only innovative but highly effective. My child is always excited to go and try out new activities. The teachers (esp Ms Jia Yu & Qing Lao Shi) are incredibly dedicated and caring. They go the extra mile to ensure that each child feels at home and supported. Itâ€™s comforting to know that my child is well supported in his learning and exploration journey. Highly recommended for any parent looking for a childcare center that truly cares!",
