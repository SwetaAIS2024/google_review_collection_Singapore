marie ng,5,"I only have wonderful review for the team from Magicseal!! Bryan did an on site assessment & quotation. I shared with him that i prefer to install my Magicseal outside the windows, as I’ve sliding windows and I stay first floor.
Bryan gave his professional advice, suggesting what kind of frame and to install on which window panel so as not to block the view!
The fabrication of the product didn’t take long, only took roughly a week!
Mr Yong & Mr Chong did a fabulous work on site! the team is efficient, with good workmanship. I’d highly recommend Magicseal!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113548143543626627302/reviews

Ashfiz m,5,"Excellent service from Salim and Daniel!
I couldn’t be happier with the installation experience. Daniel and Salim were not only skilled and efficient but also incredibly friendly and respectful throughout the entire process. They showed up right on time, explained everything clearly, and made sure I was happy with the setup before they left. It’s rare to find professionals who care this much about their work and customer satisfaction. Big thanks to both of them—I’d gladly recommend them to anyone!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117989374244684943147/reviews
