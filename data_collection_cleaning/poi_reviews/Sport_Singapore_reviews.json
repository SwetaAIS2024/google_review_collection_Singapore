      "text": "ActiveSG ++ app, and while it offers access to various activities and bookings, its inflexible refund policy is a major drawback.  The app does not offer refunds for unintentional mistakes, which is unacceptable.  In today's digital world, users make mistakes â€“ be it accidentally double-booking a slot or misreading the booking details.  A rigid \"no refund\" policy is not only unfair but also discourages users from utilizing the app.  This inflexibility significantly detracts from the overall user experience and makes me hesitant to recommend the app to others.  The lack of leniency in handling such situations is a serious flaw that needs immediate attention.  I would advise potential users to carefully consider this significant limitation before committing to using the app.  Thumbs down..",
