XY C,4,"I ordered the regular salad (SGD11.50 + 1 for falafel = SGD12.50) paid using the KrisPay app which is super protein packed; brown rice, spiced falafel (3x), cherry tomatoes, broccoli (abit dry), chickpeas, tofu and honey mustard sauce. The portion is super big for ladies, cannot finish in one sitting. Will return to try their sandwiches.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102084721777077961598/reviews
Jo-Anne Tsai,2,"Absolutely shocking. There were no trays for pastries so I put an almond croissant in a bag, requesting at the counter for the staff to put it on a plate for dine in. Her response was ""you can just eat it from the bag"". My partner and I were already seated with an earlier order of drinks and a slice of cake so this wasn't for takeaway.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116099022460649329551/reviews
rachel ho,3,"Food is good but cashier service is consistently poor. All the cashiers are rude, impatient and condescending. It's a shame really.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111063143252242708520/reviews
Garrick Wang,1,"Cedele shouldn’t be getting scores like this. They’ve been around for some time and their food is always spot on or at least not far from it.

The place here just feels really dodgy with the poor yellow lighting. Just doesn’t feel well illuminated. It’s not romantic, it feels dingy.

The service is poor due to the lack of staff, a problem which is crippling much of the F&B industry so, I can understand to a certain extent.

What bothered me was this - i ordered a cup of English breakfast tea and I requested for a small cup of milk to go along. I’m one of the many whom drink my English Breakfast with some milk, just to help smoothen and make the texture of the drink creamy and nice. Just like how you’d drink earl grey with lemon to make it taste a little more wholesome.

To my dismay, they told me they need to charge me for a dash of milk. What?

I mean come on, the cup is already small enough.

Just as a passing comment out of frustration, I told the lady who drinks English breakfast without even a dash of milk? She said yes there are.

Oh well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105868881630770505330/reviews
Kendrick Wee,3,Service was on the slower side though there wasn’t much crowd during lunch. Protein bowl was pretty tasty. Chicken and the falafels were good. More salad dressing would be better.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793547912532718349/reviews
