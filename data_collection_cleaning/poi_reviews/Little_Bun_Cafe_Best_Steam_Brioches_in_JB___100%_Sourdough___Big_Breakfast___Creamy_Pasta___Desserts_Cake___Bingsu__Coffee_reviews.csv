Muhammad Muawiz,4,"One of the best aesthetic looking interior shops in Eco Botanic. Had the big breakfast and the vegetable was great. They will steam the brioche bread in front of you but my expectation was higher for the price in term of taste. The waitress/cashier was really bubbly and helpful. Overall not bad, the prices are on the high sides, but if you like the environment can just order drinks/brioche to enjoy the environment, free water available on every table.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109614946268667457214/reviews
Anna Ellie,4,"If you have been to Mil toast house in Korea or in Bangkok, this minimalist cafe reminds me of it with its interior and aesthetics. Was quite surprised to see that the cafe was crowded at 11am when I visited on a weekday. 😮

Decided to try their recommended steamed brioche bun which comes two sauces of your choice - I chose cream butter and honey kaya. Taste wise, I think it’s was a bit disappointing in terms of the kaya that they gave. It was a bit watery, I couldn’t really taste the fragrance of the kaya? The steam bun was soft and fluffy, though I think it didn’t have the ‘wow’ factor? Maybe should have ordered the ham and cheese bun instead 😅

The truffle mushroom pasta on the other hand was impressive though. The flavour was rich and most importantly you can taste the truffle. Their coffee was not bad. ☕️
I could taste the caramel in my coffee which is great, because sometimes the flavour isn’t quite exactly there. The tiramisu coffee was yummy too. Overall, the food wasn’t so bad. If you’re planning to come here, do try and come early to get a seat as the cafe isn’t very big as well 👍🏼",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101222681494986618069/reviews
I am Haito,5,"Came here to try their coffee and dessert and let's just say everything is a 10/10! I will surely come back soon to try their pastas! 😍

Atmosphere:
It is great for relaxing, and their coffee cup is adorable. Music is also very chill.

Cheesecake:
Not too sweet, very soft, crumbly and decadent.

Coffee:
Finally found a coffee place near me that doesn't have any burnt taste and less acidic.

Service:
The staff here are wonderful, sweet and very professional 🫶

Additional remarks:
WiFi is provided 😁",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108046468062025245843/reviews

Joel Tan,5,The bread is so good! The coffee is really good too! Had the flat white and mocha. It is strong dark roast but not milky. The steam bread was also just right! Would recommend if you’re in the area!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101439308957065778267/reviews
