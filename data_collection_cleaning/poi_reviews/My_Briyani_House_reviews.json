      "text": "Below average briyani, came to try here as it was rather quiet and no people. Atmosphere wise definitely good especially after lunch hours I suppose, however for the other restaurants and food chains here is also rather quiet on weekdays.\nThe mutton biryani is not worth the price, 1 piece of bone with so less meat for $11? I was quite shocked to only find one piece of bone with little meat in the relatively huge pile of rice.\nThe whole plate of rice, meat, curry was totally lukewarm, not even a single bit warm. And the mutton is rather tough to bite too, it just makes no sense of just few chunks of meat on the bone with so much rice at the price. Just look at how small the mutton bone is in the rice......\nFurthermore I was so turn off when being charge $1 for chilli padi?? Why do u need to charge $1 for chilli padi? No doubt it was quite a alot of chilli however there was only 2 of us and furthermore I was the only one eating the chilli. Why can't you just give a small plate or few pieces of chilli padi without charging like what usually restaurants does?\nChicken briyani is much more worth as at least it's a piece of chicken thigh with obviously more meat then the mutton, however it's also just all lukewarm for the chicken too.\nWon't come back here ever again...",

The display menu unfortunately does not show everything they have (at least for the prata) and there isn't a full menu in sight when I visited, so most likely you will have to enquire.\n\nMeh experience only...",

If you are not interested to work, just take the day off. You are spoiling your day and our day as well.",
