      "text": "Rustic authentic Japanese restaurant. Not quite a izakaya but the menu is quite extensive. The curry pork katsu is really nice. Love the curry. But the tonkatsu don, the pork was not cooked through and can kinda taste it’s frozen pork kind. That’s why I gave 4 stars. Two tables of Japanese customers came so I guess place quite legit. Lady boss is Japanese. Price is reasonable. Mains came faster than the side dishes lol. The fried pink shrimp is yum! Total spending $88 for 2 pax without alcohol. For the amount of food we ordered it’s quite reasonable for this area. Btw they got a good selection of alcohol beer and sake.",

And very authentic Japanese-izakaya-feel complete with Japanese TV show so much so that I started communicating with the staff in Japanese LOL. Large food menu with daily specials, as well as a reasonably large sake 清酒 and shochu 焼酎 selection. If you are a lover of Japanese izakaya culture, this is definitely a place for you! =)",

This is also the place where they'd get their izakayas, watch football on the telly (it was during the world cup) and down a few beers. But the customers are quite reserved, not like the mamak crowd.\n\nOh yeah, and the food is great. Everything that our friends ordered were gone within minutes so what can you do, you just have to order more eh. The highlight for me was the stingray, which funnily enough, when I had it last was 20 years ago when I visited Singapore also.",

The beef steak was also juicy and tender and the gyoza was crispy on the outside and flavourful within. All in all you’ll get cheap beer, good food and prompt service, so you really can’t go wrong.",
