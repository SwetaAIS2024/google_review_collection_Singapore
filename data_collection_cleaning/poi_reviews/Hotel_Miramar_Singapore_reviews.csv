G Star,4,"It wouldn’t take much to spruce this place up a little to modernise, yet it’s clean and comfortable as it is. For the price you are not exactly in walking distance to the centre of the action but with a bus stop out the front, buses are coming regularly and the transport system is easy to navigate. The breakfast could do with a few more western delicacies and don’t miss having a look at the live seafood.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103675835250557347949/reviews
Peter Cougan,2,"The room we had was a box with an ensuite. And a little tired. Although, the bathroom had been re-done & was nice.
When checking in, we were asked to submit a credit card to charge $50.00 for any future charges ect. Which , took about a minute to achieve. It took nearly a week to cancel the said credit card charge & return our money. Which, had an exchange rate added to it. To get anywhere from the hotel required a cab.
Ok, but it comes with booking fee's and if it's after after say 6pm you are charged an extra fee. But , the food was impressive !. With the exception of the 20 - 30 (mine?) workers that come & go through the dining room area often In work garb. They are at times a little grubby & very often very loud & somewhat obnoxious... So , be prepared for that one , it's not much fun at all. That's twice for us - first & last time !.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115648826155895013601/reviews
TRAVEL MAN,3,"The Miramar Hotel in Singapore is a reasonable to good 3-star hotel, but in my opinion, it does not meet 4-star standards.

I originally booked a Deluxe Room, not realising this was actually the most basic option. Fortunately, we were kindly upgraded to a Premium Room (one level up), but even this was quite average and is showing its age. I’d recommend checking the hotel’s official website before booking, as calling the entry-level room ""Deluxe"" can be misleading.  The rooms are limited on power sockets, and our WiFi on floor 14 was poor at circa 25 Meg!

The location is good—about 20 minutes from both the Business District and the main tourist areas. A highlight was the excellent running route along the Singapore River into town right opposite the Hotel.

A few suggestions to enhance the guest experience if I may?

1. Sunbeds– Consider adding cushions to the plastic sun loungers for better comfort.
2. Food Hygiene & Breakfast – The chefs try very hard and are clearly talented individuals and are accomodating but the overall experience at breakfast is reduced by; 2a)The food warmers and lids at the breakfast buffet were deliberately left open by staff, or reopened when found closed too (I assume) show off their contents, this means though that all the intended hot food was exposed to open air and guests. This causes the food to cool quicker and lacks basic hygiene protection from dust, sneezing, or perhaps stray hairs. Keeping the lids on would help, surely this is why they all come with lids!
2b)The main seating area at the far end or the nice seats near the windows that offer space seem to open and then close randomly day by day, hour by hour leaving you to sit in a tight walk way.
3. Gym Amenities – Although at check-in we were told the gym provided towels and water, neither was available as of March 25. If this is a cost-saving measure, perhaps consider offering a simple bottle of disinfectant spray and a cloth instead so you can wipe equipment before and after use —this is standard practice in most western gyms.
4. Room Cleanliness– The carpets, particularly around all the edges and behind furniture, could use more a regular vacuuming, not just the middle bits, Our room was noticeably grubby over our 3 night stay.  Furniture should ideally be pulled regularly out also, it wasn't for our room as seen when searching for power sockets behind bedside tables (none).

Overall, the hotel is decent for a 3-star stay, but there’s room for improvement to meet the expectations of a 4-star rating.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101552051076084424619/reviews
Meagan Eishen,4,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Miramar. Our room was fairly nice - our only complaint is that there really weren’t many electrical outlets so if you only have 2 it can be difficult to charge devices. But the staff were brilliant, the breakfast was lovely & it was very easy to order a grab there to other places. It’s a bit out of the way for walking to attractions, but grab is a fairly affordable method of transportation. We’d stay again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117280365285095693799/reviews
