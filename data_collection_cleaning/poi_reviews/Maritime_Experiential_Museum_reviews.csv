Nitin Jain,3,"Well the exhibit looks Fabulous from the outside and would definitely pull you in, but once you get inside it's not something which will bowl you over.

It's just an average place we felt that it could have been skipped as we were on the play max pass and wanted to cover lot of destinations in just a day.

It also has the Pirates exhibit inside which has got some really good photo spots provided your phone can capture great shots in low lighting condition.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109804812840966813323/reviews

However , some of the things, like the show, is a bit old and outdated and it's not really worth the 3 minutes.  The fake pirate attack boat is nice and dry, but smells like rope",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105654750437303926782/reviews
