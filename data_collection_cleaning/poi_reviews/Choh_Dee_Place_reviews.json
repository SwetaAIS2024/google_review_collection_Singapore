Possibly the best coffeeshop in Bukit Panjang area. You won’t get hot and sweaty because it is really well ventilated. Kudos to the team for keeping it clean and comfy as well!",

It is very peaceful because you are not aware of all the traffic, just a block away. The staff were all very friendly. Best of all was that the food on the plate I received looked just as good as the one in the picture and I also really enjoyed it.",

My friends and I were standing around a dirty table waiting for it to be cleaned when the cleaner approached us from behind to clean it, we were unaware that we were blocking him and instead of politely asking us to give way, he stared and glared at us instead in an aggressive manner which really ruined the overall mood of our experience. Would complain to the management but I cant find their contact info. Food is very sub-par.",
