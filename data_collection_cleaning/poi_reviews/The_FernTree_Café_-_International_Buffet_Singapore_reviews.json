The staff are also very attentive and always ready to help specially Lennie. They offer different cuisine - but choices are not overwhelming. The food is always replenished. Overall it was a great experience! Will recommend!",

It was an amazing experience as always and the staff members made sure the dinner was special for her with an extra celebration. They also prepared a photo for her as memory for the day. Thank you so much for making the day special for our little celebration! :)",

The food was delicious, fresh, and beautifully presented—especially the local dishes that were full of authentic flavor. What made the experience truly memorable was the excellent service. A special shoutout to Mr. Philip Chew, who went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. His warmth, attentiveness, and genuine hospitality really stood out.

However, the service was top-notch! The staff were very attentive, plates were cleared fast. Thanks to Philip and the team for their excellent service and the delicious birthday cake was a lovely surprise that made this occasion truly memorable. We left with full bellies and big smiles!",
