Ling Ho,4,"Located on the second floor.

Garlic pork- awesome in taste
Pad thai prawn- awesome in taste
Kai lan pork belly- awesome in taste

Food came quickly, super worth like 3 dishes for $23. If it had just a bit more wok hei and hotter would definitely be 5 stars for me. Nevertheless, recommend.
Ps:
(There's a fruit juice stall just diagonally opposite, between a roast meat shop and a muslim food stall has pretty decent fruit juices, i had the ABC to wash down the thai food, was good).",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104662213360280912898/reviews
Chee Wan Lim,5,"We have tried twice in vain to have a meal there but was always too late as they tend to close earlier likely once they sold out their food.
Ordering is by chit looking at the photos of dishes hang around the stall.
Food is authentic and very reasonable. Only the diluted green curry chicken disappoints. Rest of food is great -
Fried fish with fish sauce
Balacan Kangkong
Garlic pork
Thai fried chicken
Prawn bean curd
Fried Tang Hoon
Will be back again to try other dishes üòã",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118275892572972593141/reviews
