ankur sachan,5,"The Curry Culture – Cuppage

I recently visited The Curry Culture at Cuppage on a Wednesday. The ambience was very pleasant and welcoming, giving off positive vibes right from the moment I entered. It wasn’t crowded at all—only two other groups were there—making it a peaceful and relaxing experience.

The food was good and the service was excellent. The staff were attentive and polite, which really added to the overall experience.

Prices are on the higher side, but that’s expected for a place like this in Cuppage, where the setting and experience justify the premium.

A great spot if you’re looking for a chill evening with good food.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102674532215476084509/reviews

Kyle Yeo,5,"Amazing food. Even better service. Jimmy and Shubahm were incredible hosts, so friendl. Finally our search for a new regular northern Indian restaurant has come to an end. One of the few places that could scratch our vindaloo itch. Naan was wonderful too. Nuff said, highly recommend!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101310954338828572954/reviews
