SOH JIN HAN EDDY,1,"I visited the Tanjong Pagar branch of 8 Medical Aesthetic Clinic and had a very disappointing experience. I was misled by beautician Anna during my Dynamic Pulse Light treatment, where I was told that my acne would stop after the 3rd session. However, after 5 sessions over 2 months, my skin only got worse.

Anna also displayed a serious lack of empathy during the treatments, brushing off my pain and questioning whether I was overreacting. The hard-selling was intense from the first session, and despite seeing no improvements, they still tried to push another package on me during my last visit.

The communication was difficult, as Anna’s Mandarin was much stronger than mine, and she became frustrated when I couldn’t understand her. On top of that, there was no proper documentation or photos to track my progress. For a clinic that charges over S$1,300, I expected a professional and results-oriented approach, but unfortunately, it was the exact opposite.

I wouldn’t recommend this place at all. If you do go, be prepared for hard-selling and inconsistent service. You’ll need to negotiate hard if you don’t want to overpay for treatments that may not even work. I personally won’t be returning. Avoid the Tanjong Pagar branch.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110032537923948038022/reviews
fan fan,1,"I had a disappointing experience at 8 medical Aesthetics 2023 to 2024 when they first moved to international plaza.

In the beginning, they took photos to monitor the treatment progress. But after a few visits, they stopped doing that. Initially I thought they forgot and asked them. They said if I wanted, they would do it. How unprofessional! During that time, I also noticed that my melasma was not getting lighter and highlighted to the 2 lady assistants/beauticians, jiaxin and edna (I can't remember her name). Their usual response was that melasma is not easy to treat. I'm well aware of that. But initially it did improved slightly but towards the last few sessions,  it not only didn't get lighter but was back to the original condition, if not worse. I reckon that could be why they stopped taking photos for comparison.

Besides that, I find it weird that the lady assistants there seem to be guiding the doctor during the treatment process. She would point to the doctor where he should focus the treatment when the doctor himself should know exactly what he should focus on and how much intensity of treatment is required? This happened to me during all my sessions there.

Another issue is that communication was mainly through/with the assistants and they were only keen to recommend products to me each time after my treatment.

There was very minimal interactions with the doctor. He had never review with me the progress of my treatment, not even once!

I was left disappointed when I completed my package without any improvement in my melasma, at best only a slight improvement in skin tone.

My initial consultation was specifically for melasma treatment which they claimed to have specific machines that their other outlets don't have.

Both doctors snd assistants at this clinic obviously lack empathy and are unprofessional to say the least. I will totally advise anyone to avoid this clinic st all costs.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116035748106478306019/reviews
V L,5,"I had a fantastic experience at 8 Medical Aesthetic Clinic (International Plaza) for my procedure. Dr. Daniel was very approachable and friendly, taking the time to thoroughly explain the process to me. Elva and Minni were also wonderful, ensuring I was comfortable and that the procedure was as painless as possible. Dr. Daniel administered the injection with great care, and I barely felt a thing.

What really impressed me was the follow-up care. The team checked in on me to make sure everything was going well, showing how responsible and kind they are. I truly appreciate the level of care I received, and I'll definitely return to them for any future procedures. Highly recommended!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100349503230330665538/reviews

Kudos too to his 2 lovely assistants - Elva and Jiaxin, for being so reassuring and caring. They are such a blast to talk for all things skincare and everything under the sun.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109901113851636480212/reviews
