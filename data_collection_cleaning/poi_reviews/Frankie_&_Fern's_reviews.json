The food was amazing - veggie brekkie was delicious, especially the baked tomatoes, and the melon mangosteen cake and lemon loaf cake were fragrant and yummy without being too sweet. Our waiter was attentive and kept our water glasses full. We loved that we could linger for almost 5 hours without being rushed. Highly recommend!",

The Brussels sprouts were quite good at first, though they turned out to be a bit too spicy for my taste and started to feel a little salty after a while.\n\nI was a bit disappointed with the wood-roasted pork chop—it didn’t quite live up to the recommendation. That might just be a matter of personal taste between me and my friend, but it lacked that “wow” factor and didn’t really have a strong meaty flavor.\n\nOn a brighter note, the ambience was really nice, which made the overall dining experience more pleasant. Maybe I’ll give some of the other dishes a try next time.",
