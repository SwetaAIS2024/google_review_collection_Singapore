We got seats in front of the chef and the kids were excited to see the chef cook for us (but also afraid that the oil will splatter on them)\n\nFood was decent but full of garlic. The garlic fried rice was very delicious. There was also free appetizer (cabbage with garlic sauce). Came out of the restaurant smelling like garlic.\n\nSpent $100 for 4 pax.",

Current promo they also add a cup of free steam egg. Upgraded to garlic fried rice which tasted  great. Overall good value and taste as the dishes were freshly prepared.",

      "text": "I don't normally post bad reviews but I was utterly disappointed by the lack of quality control at the Jurong Point outlet compared to the NEX outlet.\n\nWe ordered 2 sets of the sliced beef with garlic fried rice, and the beef arrived overcooked, tough and dry. This is the probably the worst teppanyaki I've had, even compared to those at food courts. The garlic rice that came with the sets were also atrocious - completely lacking in flavour of any kind, almost like having plain rice with bits of fried garlic.\n\nThe sliced pork was marginally better but was still slightly overcooked and dry.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the slushy that came free at the end of the meal.\n\nI find it inexcusable to be serving food of this standard, especially when it's improperly cooked and not a matter of subjective taste.",
