Commendable to the staffs for their proficiency during check in. Although there was a crowd during check in time, it didn't take me too long to check in to my room. Excellent customer service!",

Rooms are good and well equipped, located near to bus stop, its just a minute walk. Breakfast menu is good, but would have rated more if more indian menu had been added, given that many guests are from India.",

The hotel however,  could do with some sprucing up. The car park is dim, dingy and narrow. The path through to the hotel lobby (passengers lift was \"under maintenance) was an harrowing experience for me, a senior citizen,  and my high-heeled lady companion.\n\nThe washrooms are worthy of any Korean zombie movie complete with blinking overhead lights and a pipe humming that is louder than a passing jet plane.  No wonder the ladies have the fastest turnaround in Singapore.",

There were 6 different flavours of ice cream. There was a self-service laksa station. There were rice, noodles, plain porridge and sweet potato porridge. Refill of food was done quite promptly. The service crew cleared the empty plates quite fast too. I had a good experience dining there.",
