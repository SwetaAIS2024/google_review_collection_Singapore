Ariel Chen,5,"A very clean and inviting restaurant which is a gem for Japanese food in JB. Each yakitori is prepared meticulously (so more patience expected!).

Chicken belly is a must try.

Will definitely recommend to friends and family and be back again :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102381052126915520215/reviews
Faith Wang,5,"The entrance to the restaurant was unassuming and we walked past it by accident the first time. Heading up the stairs, the decor of the place was simple but sufficient.

Service was great. The restaurant is a one-man show, and from taking our orders to preparing and serving the food, we had a great time. The chicken breast was juicy and tender, and we enjoyed all the skewers we bought. Good quality and taste.

We were the only ones in the restaurant on a Tuesday night, which was quite lovely because it felt like a private dining experience. That being said, this humble restaurant is definitely worth visiting and worth more attention! The owner said he's been running it for 6 years. We hope it remains open for many more :) We'll definitely be back!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112099522913600589296/reviews

Carolyn C,5,"Chanced upon this level 3 small eatery that boasts of super delicious yakitori! We were blown away by every single skewer that served; grilled to perfection. From the yasai, to the meats, and even the Onigiri, yummy!  üòã Owner/Chef/Server= one man show; he never failed to impress with the great food and service. Even though it was a small area with only a few tables, it was clean and comfortable. We will definitely be back! üòä üëç",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111038822995080905249/reviews
Terry Chua,5,"Wanted to try this place the last time but was closed. I came back today and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Really a fantastic place and a hidden find. Fantastic food at a reasonable price. Very cozy place. Limited seats available.

Ordered the usual chicken parts and yaki onigari. Everything was fantastic especially the yaki onigari. Normally most places will serve the rice ball seasoned on the outside. This place solves the seasoning problem with their own mix of seasoning powder, which coats the rice when you break it open, seasoning the inside as well.

Well worth the trip to try the yakitori.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114779419389907602398/reviews
