      "text": "I can't express enough how grateful I am for the wonderful experience my son had at this preschool. He began in infant care and stayed until he was one and a half years old, and it has truly been a nurturing and positive journey. From the start, the teachers were incredibly warm, attentive, and genuinely caring, making sure that every aspect of his development was supported. The environment was always safe, clean, and welcoming, which gave me peace of mind knowing that my son was in good hands. He was always happy to go to school, and I could see how much he enjoyed the activities and the love from the teachers. Itâ€™s clear that this preschool has a true passion for creating a caring, enriching space for young children. I am so grateful for all the care and love they provided and would highly recommend them to any parent!",

      "text": "Both my kids attended Heartyland (infant care at Teck Whye and then preschool at Maysprings). The principal, Mrs Lee, is wonderful. She is patient with children and both my kids benefited from the nurturing environment at Heartyland. We felt our children were in good hands at all times and they loved their time there! A special shout out to the infant care teachers too, they were so loving and confident with managing babies and toddlers, we truly could have peace of mind with Heartyland as our child care provider.",
