Bella,1,Need to reset pin but can't do it online. They gave me a quick serve number. Two people in front. Waited an hour. Asked for the manager who wanted to serve but the pin can't be reset because I don't have the physical card. Why didn't they  tell me in the first place? The whole process wasted so much time. Yes I'm closing my UOB account.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111738551608361343877/reviews
Law Family,4,"I visited the branch on 18 Jan at about 9.25am and joined the queue. Once the branch opened, customers were efficiently processed into the bank by an Indian lady staff. She greeted each one of us with a bright smile and informed us of our waiting time. All the counters were opened and I was attended to swiftly. I am pleased with the service provided. There was a separate queue for the exchange of new money for lunar new year and it did not interfere with those queuing to do other banking matters. Well done!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111095348427350193243/reviews
AOCS,1,"Extremely slow service. We took the queue number to open bank account. The next number is ours, as there are no customers in line. Tell me why do we still need to wait at least an hour to be served? Ridiculous! The RMs are even walking around chit chatting to each other, what’s the purpose of their existence?",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111143966615436662779/reviews
Anita Tan,1,"At the UOB reception today a male staff said waiting time to get an internet banking into my phone app would take 10 to 15 minutes but after waiting 45 minutes, the counter staff said she was not able to do for me as the bank requires a physical ic and not a digital ic. I hope in future the uob reception would ask clients if they have brought their physical ic before giving a queue number. And the reception must not tell clients that the wait is 10 to 15 minutes when the counters are not able to fulfill the stated wait time.
Now I have to re-queue all over again at another branch as the novena branch closes at 12.30pm on Saturdays.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108652551243759696552/reviews
