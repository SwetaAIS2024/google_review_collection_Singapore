Shunyi Ma,5,"I’m a returning customer and recently ordered the Satay Bee Hoon. I requested to mix bee hoon with yellow noodles, and the staff were all very friendly and accommodating. When it’s not too busy, they even serve the food to your table. The ingredients are generous and delicious—especially the pork slices, which are really tasty. The prices are also very reasonable. I’ll definitely keep coming back. Wishing the boss have good business!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102997138929368945832/reviews
JATHL,5,"Looked extremely starchy at first but wasn’t when the noodles were stirred up. Balanced and cohesive taste, which was quite enjoyable. Crispy pork lard and a nice cooked sambal added to the dining experience. No wok hei though. But I don’t think it’s essential with a braised noodle dish.
Service was friendly and they even helped us carry some of the plates to our table.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110357299060106350854/reviews
Teck Chong Law,3,"Heard that this hawker breakaway from the other popular stall in the nearby HDB flat.  So, we ordered both dishes that were popular at that nearby stall.

The Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee was okay initially.   But the taste builds up and gets better as we continue to take more mouthfuls 👍

The Fried Kway Teow definitely outshines the nearby stall 👍👍

There was only one lady in front of us and we received the food within 5-10 minutes.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103886416957126587915/reviews
Jodeci Fine,5,"66 Noodles (Hokkien Mee & Char Kway Teow)
Open 7.30am to 8.30pm
Closed on Monday
630 Yishun Street 61, S760630

Went for a Yishun food tour and chanced upon this hkm stall. Read that they are a breakaway stall from 618 hkm.

Portion is good for $5, cooked by a Vietnamese lady. They use 3 types of mee, yellow mee, thin bee hoon & thick bee hoon. Taste surprisingly good, gravy has prawny taste, pork lard is crispy and chili is different (a little sour) but spicy (guess it's Vietnamese style). Will try their ckt next time.

We will be back!
