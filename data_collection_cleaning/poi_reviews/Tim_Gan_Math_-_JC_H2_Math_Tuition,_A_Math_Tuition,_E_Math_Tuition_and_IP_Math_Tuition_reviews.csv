Darrius Yap,5,"Having been tutored by Mr Gan for H2 Mathematics throughout my JC life, I found his notes to be well categorised and broken down into the different question types that allows for better understanding of concepts.  His website containing extra questions and video solutions is also super useful for revision. The option to take online lessons where resources are shipped to your home has also made taking tuition lessons more convenient. Mr Gan is truly a super inspirational and dedicated tutor who has helped me conquer JC mathematics. Discovering Tim Gan Mathematics on google is truly a godsend and I highly recommend this tuition centre! ðŸ˜€",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100210689810657805238/reviews
