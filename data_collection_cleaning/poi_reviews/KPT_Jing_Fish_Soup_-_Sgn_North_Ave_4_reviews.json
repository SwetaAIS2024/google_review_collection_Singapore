      "text": "Really love the fish soup here - the fish pieces are sizeable and portion is quite generous. Each of them are fresh, tender yet still full of bite. Soup is deliciously made with lots of garlic (although it can get salty sometimes), tofu, tomatoes and veggie. It's a comfort food for sure and something I think of getting regularly. Recommended to try for sure! Service is not the best though but don't let that put you off from the delicious bowl of fish soup!",
