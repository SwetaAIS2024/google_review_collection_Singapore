      "text": "Quite impressed with the standard of the food from a random industrial coffeeshop store. Only word of advice I'd give is to request for less oil and less salt because it was a bit too heavy on the salt for my liking. Chongqing spicy cubed chicken (辣子鸡) was done super well - no complaints, really nice thin slices of onion and green peppers that made the whole dish really fragrant. Shredded cabbage (手撕包菜) came with thinly sliced pork belly and had a nice kick with vinegar. Sauerkraut fish (酸菜鱼片) was a massive bowl but bummed that they used dory fish but decent taste and not too oily. Will come again!",
