      "text": "Visited on a weekday night and the token-enabled machines were available. Did not have to wait for a machine.\n\nParking spots were available in front of the laundromat but they were all taken up by multiple lorries and cars. We were somehow compelled to park at the rear of the row of shophouses, risking a parking fine and were even told off by one of the business owners along that row who claimed the road at the back belong to him and his company.\n\nStepping into the laundromat, one notices first thing the lighting, bright colours and the nice woodwork. We were very glad we found Dutch Colony coffee being served from a very expensive and branded coffee machine! The cappuccino was fragrant and the pricing seemed reasonable. Payment was cashless, making it very convenient. The condiments were DIY, had to spin them to dispense and were very cute actually.\n\nWe were also fortunate to meet the owners who were a friendly duo who shared the concept behind TDT. They even obliged us for a photo! Kudos to the team and we wish you all success! üíØü´ß\n\nPS: Would air-conditioning your place be an option you would consider as a comfortable amenity? Would be perfecto!",
