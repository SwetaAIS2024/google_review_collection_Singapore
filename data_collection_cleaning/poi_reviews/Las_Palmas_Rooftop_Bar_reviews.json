      "text": "A Must-Visit Bar with Exceptional Cocktails!\n\nI had an amazing experience at Las Palmas Bar, and a huge part of that was thanks to Karenthyna, the incredibly talented bartender. She didn‚Äôt just serve drinks‚Äîshe crafted her own signature cocktails, each one more delicious and addictive than the last. You can tell she has a deep knowledge of mixology, as she explained every ingredient and technique with passion.\n\nThe atmosphere at Las Palmas is vibrant yet cozy, making it the perfect spot for a night out. But what truly sets it apart is the top-notch service and the creativity behind the bar. If you‚Äôre looking for a place with unique, expertly made cocktails and a bartender who knows her craft inside out, Karenthyna is the one to look for!\n\nI‚Äôll definitely be coming back for more! Highly recommend!\n\n-Victoria ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è",

Taste features dark rum and other tropical flavours fit for a refreshing drink by the infinity pool.\n\nDuring the party, we took part in an engaging hands-on Cocktail Masterclass and a DIY Gin and Tonics selection, learning about the different spirits and of course enjoying the drinks! These delightful activities can also be arranged for private events.\n\nIt was a totally wonderful experience at Las Palmas and you have to gather some friends to come enjoy the awesome vibes, sip stunning cocktails while soaking in the beautiful sunset view!",
