      "text": "Worst experience ordering from this store ever. Please save yourself the hassle and don't ever order from this, not through online platform like Grab or any other. Ordered on a rainy day, because i was sick and had no energy to walk out for food. Showed that it was preparing for almost an hour, bound to delivered to my place at 7.45pm. It kept showing in the kitchen preparing. once i realised it took unusually long, tried to cancel on grab to order another food, grab support told me i can't cancel because the delivery is handled by the Domino's own delivery system. It is ridiculous! Call them and no one pick up!!!!!!!! Call yourself a pizza store????? Please make yourself training better!!!!!\n\nI did not get my food.",

      "text": "always empty and the food takes really long. sometimes they don't even assemble the seats they just leave the chairs stacked on the tables because nobody dines in. One time I ordered, went next door to burger king and ordered and received my burger, went back to dominos and my pizza still wasnt ready... despite all this the food itself is DELICIOUS (even though the bread dots always come in 1 whole loaf they dont bother cutting for you). and on 2 occasions I ordered the cinnadots the sugar powder somehow got on the outside of the box... despite all this I would still buy their food because it's that good.",
