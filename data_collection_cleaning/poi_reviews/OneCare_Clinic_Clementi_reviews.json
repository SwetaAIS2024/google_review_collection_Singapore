In my opinion, she is very unprofessional and one of the worst doctors around. She did not bother checking on the patient thoroughly and gave a very vague diagnosis. I probably can get more advice from google or even the clinic nurse than from this particular doctor. Please do check on the doctor on duty before going.",

I don't understand why people would waste time effort and energy. Nonsense. Don't waste your time.",
