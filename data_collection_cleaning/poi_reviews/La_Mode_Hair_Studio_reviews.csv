Janna Lim,1,"Worst place for a haircut ever!!!

1. I had told the hairdresser to trim my hair because I want to tidy it. But she kept cutting and cutting! I am so upset that the hair I spent MONTHS growing out and maintaining was just GONE. The length is way too short to be a trim.

2. I opted to wash my hair and the lady used her nails to scrub my scalp. It was painful. I'm surprised there was no bleeding.

3. This part INFURIATES ME THE MOST. I asked to get my fringe cut and for the fringe to remain the same shape because I had those nice korean bangs but just wanted it shorter. She kept asking if I wanted some slope and I'm like ??? I donâ€™t know what my previous hair dresser did. Ok nvm. Then she cuts my bangs and its CHOPY and of course SHORT. The chopy-ness shows so much because it's so short. I didn't say anything then because it looked ok when I left. After washing my hair myself, I got to see the MESS that it is. It's so ugly and my mother laughed at my fringe. Everyone I asked said the fringe is not nice.

I am so upset and so disappointed. I look at my hair and I feel so angry because I can't do anything but wait. The time and money spent on growing my hair went down the drain. I feel so sad and angry whenever I look in the mirror. It will take months for me to regrow my hair to the length that I want. I'm still livid and there are so many other more complaints I have but these 3 are the main ones.

Hairdressers- please always cut less. You can cut more if the customer wants. You can't put the hair back once it's cut.

I will never go back there again. Customers beware! Don't ever step foot inside!!!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108020054453070987053/reviews
