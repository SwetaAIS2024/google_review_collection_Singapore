Flo Yeow,4,"It's a hawker centre and wet market at a very old neighborhood estate, here in Singapore. They've recently renovated and tidied up the space, which makes the entire experience much more hygienic and palatable.

A good variety of hawker food stalls here at the hawker centre, including the famous Bak Chor Mee Soup. Otherwise, it's more of a day time hawker centre; not many stalls are open in the evenings.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
William Yeo,4,"My favorite stall here is the fish soup stall. I usually eat the fish porridge with fresh and fried fish. They are quite generous with their veggies, usually 3 types. Price is a bit high, $7.50 for the porridge (used to be $6, then $7 a couple of years back).",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116058920177834172565/reviews

Sangeetha Loretta,5,"Friendly people, Reasonably prices and I like the food there. Bakery, curry bun, and assorted is $1.10 only, and it's fresh out from the oven.
Try the spicy mee goreng inside the hawker, Awesome. The curry puff in Malay store is so yummy. I love to go there.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100577304388279190756/reviews
Wayne tham,2,"One of the heartland markets for Bedok residents. Food center was congested and limited selection of food. More choices along the stretch of coffee shop houses.
Many fruit stalls have sprung over time with competitive prices.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106084388072929135930/reviews
