Eric Rains,5,"Guardian is a great go to in Singapore for your pharmacy needs. This location is small with pharmacist on site, and very hard to find. Terminal 3 departure, North, main departure level (second floor). Behind the Electronics store near small food court and Currency Exchange in the middle of the hall. Boss, MK, Burberry on other side of main hall.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110521937985979080730/reviews

Natasyah kartika Putri,2,"It is actually really nice and convenient since the guardian open 24 hours, i went there around 2 am in the morning and was looking for a moisturizer. I picked a random one and ask the employee cause im ready to check out but she seems pissed and rolled her eye when she saw me. She the asked my boarding pass with unfriendly tone. I was surprised why she had this kind of attitude I understand that it is early in the morning so i ignore it. However, in the cashier she still unfriendly and rude ( im not expecting her to welcome me with a warm smile or anything) but her overall service was sooo bad. I hope this can help to improve the employee service",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105238647763402666040/reviews
