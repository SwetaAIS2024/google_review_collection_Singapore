I don't understand the poor rating. So far, based on our many years of experience with the stall, service is good and they are fast. Food is of good standard. A good range of variety to choose from. Don't have the thirtsy feeling after consumption and is not too oily. Will continue to patronize the stall.",

Happen to be in Marine Terrace area and decided to give this place a try. We were there around 7pm and there were many people having takeaway.\n\nOrdered three dishes and the food didn’t take long to arrive although the staff did inform us that there is at least 30mins waiting time. We order the 3 cups chicken, stir fry Hongkong Kailan with garlic and fuyong omelette.\n\nFood was not bad, got nothing much to complain about. 3 cups chicken was quite good, unlike most place where they chicken piece with bone, they use chicken thigh here, much convenient to eat.\n\nOverall, worth coming back again to try other dishes.",

Very disappointing! Seems like cook only made one portion by mistake and then split it into 2 portions, didn't border to make a 2nd one! Not serious to run a business like that!",
