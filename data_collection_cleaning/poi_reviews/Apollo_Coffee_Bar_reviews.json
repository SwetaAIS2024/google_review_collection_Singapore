The honey tater tots however were slightly expensive in my opinion, and not all of the tots have honey on them, more like a light drizzle, after the initial few pieces at the top, the rest didn't have any honey on them.\n\nThe chilli biang biang noodles was nice, garlicky and a little spicy comes with 5 pieces of fried chicken and an egg. A little pricy too at 20 dollars, considering the noodle portion is quite little.",

I only two small issues with the place which is the very high noise level and menu prices are also a bit high. Otherwise it is definitely a great place to hang out!!",

      "text": "A charming little coffeehouse nestled in suburban Serangoon, offering a delightful selection of brunch fare. Among the dishes we sampled, the grilled sandwich stood out â€“ a delicious combination of GruyÃ¨re and mozzarella cheese, house-made bacon jam, and wholegrain mustard. We also enjoyed the Breakfast Burger, accompanied by crispy tater tots. It featured cheddar scrambled eggs, spicy aioli, caramelised onions, and back bacon, all served in toasted brioche buns. Excellent food and a wonderful atmosphere.",

Provides you with water that is always helpful after coffee.\n\nTheir staff members are quick to fulfill orders. Very friendly and helpful. Payment is easy. All you need to do is to order after seats were provided.\n\nThe atmosphere is similar to most cafes. Neat and clean. Nice place to have coffee if you like some crowd noise. It is not suitable for people who want absolute tranquility.\n\nWill be back again ðŸŒŸ",
