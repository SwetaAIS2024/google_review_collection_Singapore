      "text": "We have a total of 4 sessions with Dr Vanni (1 family and 3 with my daughter)  and no action plan was provided to us on how to overcome my daughter 's condition. We have to ask for an update in which Dr Vanni called me and told me my girl has low self esteem and high level of anxiety. We already knew that from her psychiatrist. There was no mention on treatment plan or therapy to be conducted . My daughter feedback that the 3 sessions were spent talking about herself. I feedback to her psychistrist and he advised us to change another psychologist. The pschologist should come up with a treat ment plan after the 2nd session. Is total waste of time and money. Avoid at all cost. Unless you have extra cash.",
