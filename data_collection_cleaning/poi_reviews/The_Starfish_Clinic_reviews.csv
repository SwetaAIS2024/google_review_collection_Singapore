B C,5,"I’ve been a patient of Dr. Harun since late 2024. Every visit so far has followed the same path: a warm smile waiting to greet me at the front desk, Dr. Harun coming out to greet me with a matching warm smile, a quick and easy visit, and very simple check-out.

As a male, I feel like it’s difficult to ask for help with mental health sometimes out of fear of judgment. This whole clinic team has made it so much easier. They make it so simple to find the help I need and they’re all so passionate and kind.

Looking forward to many more visits! ❤️",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112953164253695053236/reviews
