Miles Macdonald,5,"If I could give this museum six stars, I would. I've visited the equivalent of this in London at the Bank of England, but this exhibition is vastly superior and far exceeded my expectations. What's more, it's free.
It starts with the history of currency in Singapore and how the various economic & political events led to changes in the bank notes & coinage. Many historic bank notes are on display.
Beyond this first gallery, there are many interactive exhibits that challenge you to make decisions about how to manage the economy under different scenarios. The depth and scope of the information provided here is not aimed at children. I would rate it at ""A level"" or even ""Degree Level."" As an adult with an economics degree, I really appreciated that.
The agenda presented here is very up-to-date covering MAS's involvement in the green agenda and even modern financial developments like blockchain.
Finally, for those interested in a career in finance, it provides some pointers and options for you to explore based on your interests and skills. First class museum.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112943810663501022344/reviews

Kenneth Bok,5,"I recently visited the MAS Gallery and was impressed by the wealth of information available across the two floors. The exhibit covers a range of topics related to Singapore's monetary management, reserves, exchange rates, and the history of banknotes in Singapore. The gallery provides an informative insight into the role of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), including its history and future initiatives. The exhibition is curated with great care, featuring interactive exhibits and multimedia content that engage visitors. One of the highlights for me was seeing the banknotes from different periods in Singapore's history and learning about their significance. Overall, I highly recommend the MAS Gallery to anyone interested in exploring Singapore's monetary and economic history in a fascinating and interactive way.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112028558040888671903/reviews
