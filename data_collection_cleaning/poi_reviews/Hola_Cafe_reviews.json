      "text": "I had the same experience as the reviewer named Vision Discs. The lady at the vegetarian shop was extremely rude, and I’m very disappointed with the service. All I did was politely ask for some gravy on my beehoon, but she gave me a disapproving look as if I had done something wrong. I was charged $5.80, yet I received such poor and unfriendly treatment. I don’t believe any customer deserves to be treated this way, especially when we are paying for our food. The owner of this shop should really look into this matter and ensure that customers are treated with basic courtesy and respect.",

The server was picking up the ingredients I selected while talking loudly to the customer at the back.\n\nThe food he was chewing in his mouth flew into my takeaway box which was left unnoticed by him. I was charged $3.60 for food that has to be thrown away due to bad hygiene.\n\nToo disgusted by this experience and would never patronise this economical rice store again.",
