Doesnt come with a gold bar which i was expecting to find for that price. Probably can get the same kind of food from the coffee shops beside at a better value.",

Fried fish fillet is normal. Chicken wing is under seasoned and dry.......  Ikan bilis is normal. In general, totally not worth my trip from the east......",

Eggplant was not so good. The rest of the ingredients were excellent and has old school style and taste. They were very generous with the chili (I got an extra plate).",
