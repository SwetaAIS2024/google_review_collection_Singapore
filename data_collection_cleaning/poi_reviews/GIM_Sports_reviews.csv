Mei Tew,5,"GIM Sports is definitely a place for kids who are passionate about gymnastics.
My girl has been with them for two years and has competed countless times in various competitions.
Thanks to the strong foundation and skills she has gained, she always brings home medals.

Special thanks go to the coaches there, especially Coach K, Coach Fan, coach Tania , Coach Gilbert , Coach Azim, and Coach Nikki.
They are truly amazing. My daughter always looks forward to attending her classes.
Even though the training hours are long, she enjoys herself so much.

I canâ€™t thank the coaches enough for shaping my daughter into a more disciplined and resilient individual.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103142860347129664897/reviews

Marielle Hoogenboom,5,"The coaches and staff at GIM Sports are amazing, kind and so very inclusive. Kids of all sizes, shapes and diverse backgrounds are welcomed here with open arms. My daughter learned lots of new things and has gotten so strong. They have a beautiful new spot at Marina One with coffee spots and eateries nearby. Absolutely worth to check it out.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110331352444794309194/reviews
Rachel Seah,5,My daughter joined gimsports when she was 2.5yrs old and had a great time there for over 2 years! She still speaks fondly of the place and coaches (Hi Coach Nikki!) and hopes to be able to go back for classes someday when our schedule allows for it. Highly recommended for kids who enjoy some kind of rigour and proper coaching and skills instead of just the usual kiddie gyms.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101738641429142013647/reviews
Lu Dai,1,"We got a different coach after signing up as the one at trail class. She is very rough and rude to the kids, gives a lot of pressure, my kid was stressed and crying  so we asked for a refund. Also 60% of the time in the class is waiting for other kids to finish their exercises, my child was bored and trying to move around but it was not allowed, this is a class for toddlers so you can't expect them to sit still and wait, the coach is not good with kids at all. After our complaints they agreed with a refund,  but the money has never come back to me and they are not reachable, no reply on WhatsApp and just trying to goats on me, very unprofessional! Worst experience ever, be careful when you try to sign up for the term.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117241028451734160987/reviews
