Joanne Cheng,5,The food price is reasonable! It’s nice and I forgot to take picture. The hot green tea is fragrance and nice! Auntie Peggy is friendly and dedicated to her work. I just compliment her for her attentiveness. We ordered the salmon rice and was given the pot of green tea to pour into rice. But I did not know the pot is for us to drink as well. Auntie Peggy passed to  us and guide us. The place is clean and great place to dine with friends and family.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110408957347137900620/reviews

Parh Jin Chia,5,"I wanted to take the ramen but not the meat. So I asked the staff, he kindly explained that the meat could be changed to egg.

aydenzedd,5,"Tried their Christmas menu on Christmas Eve! Their ingredients were super generous!! Really in the spirit of Christmas. Soup broth is nice as usual. The only down side is their aircon is too cold! Soup got cold pretty fast, otherwise, will strong recommend the place for dining.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115216386767630751463/reviews
