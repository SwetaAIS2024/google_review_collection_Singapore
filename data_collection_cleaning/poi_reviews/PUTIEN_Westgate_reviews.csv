Came to this branch for the first time because I really wanted to try their squirrel fish (it’s a yellow croaker carved deboned and carved into an ornamental shape resembling a squirrel and served in sweet and sour sauce), and we weren’t disappointed at all!\n\nThe squirrel fish was fantastic; the outsides were crispy but the meat was still tender and not dry, and the sauce was delicious. I love the addition of pine nuts to the sauce - in terms of both flavour and texture.\n\nTheir braised cabbage and beancurd soup is also really delicious, and you cannot not order their mazu mee sua. Every dish is really delicious and the ingredients are high quality.\n\nService is really excellent as well. We didn’t have a reservation, so we joined the queue by scanning a QR code. A what’s app message notifies you when your table is ready so you can walk around without having to wait. Once our table was ready, we were promptly seated and our orders promptly taken. The waitstaff are really attentive (even though the restaurant is packed) and will check on you often to see if there is anything you need and whether the food is to your liking.
