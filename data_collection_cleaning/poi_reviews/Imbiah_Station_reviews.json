At the Imbiah Lookout Station there is also a bus stop for Sentosa line A (which is free).  Using this bus, which acts as a \"hop on hop off\" service, you can visit many of the island's highlights.  Line A also connects to Line B, which is also free, and will give you an opportunity to visit other parts of the island.",
