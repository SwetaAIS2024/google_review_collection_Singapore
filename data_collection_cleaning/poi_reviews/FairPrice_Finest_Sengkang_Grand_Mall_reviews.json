One of the items you can find which isn't in many outlets are the fresh and cheap bento boxes. They are affordable and taste great, definitely recommend for anyone looking for a cheap and fast meal. üëç",

      "text": "I recently bought a bunch of bananas at the Sengkang Grand Mall FairPrice outlet and paid through the self-checkout machine. To support eco-friendly practices, I chose not to print a receipt. However, after leaving the bananas at home for five days, I found them still unripe and very hard, even when I tried cutting them.\n\nI returned to the outlet hoping to exchange them, but the staff insisted I needed a receipt, despite the price tag still being on the bananas. In this digital age, it was frustrating to hear this response, especially since they could have scanned the price tag to verify the purchase. It seems contradictory to promote a paperless, environmentally friendly payment system but still demand a physical receipt for exchanges.\n\nThis experience was quite disappointing, and I hope FairPrice can reconsider this policy to make it more consistent with its sustainability efforts.\nJust wonder, Is FairPrice really Fair to consumer like me ?\nDate 5 March 2025",

      "text": "I just bought here, and there some situation highlights a lack of consistency and communication within the FairPrice company. It is concerning that the staff are not properly informed about which stores accept EZLINK as a mode of payment. This not only causes confusion for customers but also reflects poorly on the company's training and management. It is important for FairPrice to ensure that accurate and up-to-date information is provided to both customers and staff to avoid such misunderstandings in the future.\n\nPlease check ezlink advertisement..",
