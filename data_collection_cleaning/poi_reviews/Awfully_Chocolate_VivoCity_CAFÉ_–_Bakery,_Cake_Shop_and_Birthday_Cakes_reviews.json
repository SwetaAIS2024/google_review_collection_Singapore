Sweetness is just right and chocolate content is quite high for most of their cakes.\n2 slices cost @ $30 so enjoy it slowly.\nSeating area is cramped and limited.\nIt's a shame the server cannot offer complimentary plain water.\nCost $3.50 for water.\nOouch.",

They are polite and friendly overall.\n\n70% chocolate drink is very nice and smooth.  Personally I would prefer a thicker texture.  Black Forrest Cake is large and great for sharing.",

The Tiramisu here is very delicious, 70% hot chocolate was on point (thought a bit sweet) and the dark chocolate ice cream provides a relaxing and chilled experience.\n\nOverall, a nice place to catch some drinks and desserts for chill out.
