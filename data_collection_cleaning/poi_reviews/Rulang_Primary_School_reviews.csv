Hui Ying,1,"When I was P6,Mdmd Sagini was a Very Uncaring teacher to my class and scolded my friend during Children's day after PSLE for singing at a Karaoke booth. My class was not allowed to sing, which is the one thing my class loves to do the most. She called my friend stupid and was Two faced and said to the mother that she is able to improve. There are good teachers but there are also very nasty ones who Hate the students and say ""it's for their own good"". Please I highly recommend not sending your children to Rulang if you want your Child to be happy and Considerate",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113133193282286613712/reviews
Captain Clap,4,"I hope someone is reading this, that rulang is a respectable school. Im a graduate from 2024 and currently in Jurong Secondary School with AL 15. My P6 form teachers are not bad, Ms Chea is a bit strict  this year i think because our class last year was horrendous (I hope this year batch 6L students doing fine) she will give us a lot homework and nag at us, but she is still an experienced teacher. Mdm Wong is my favourite teacher in P6, she is my HMT teacher and she helped me improve in my chinese that from an AL 6 in chinese prelim to AL 3 in psle :>. The discipline in this sch is not bad at all but there are some very naughty students so whatever but the food is very cheap and the bookshop auntie is very kind. One thing negative is that the female security guard is not very polite towards us but whatever.
But ovr this sch is very good to train respect and stuff and studies is very good here but those who come will have a good time! (i hope>:>)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101884016405111390300/reviews

Charlene Sim,5,"On behalf of my daughter- “I graduated from Rulang in 2024. Rulang not only focuses on academic results, but also focuses on developing students holistically. All Rulangnites usually go to the library every two weeks as Rulang encourages pupils to read more. From primary 3 onwards, when we start having ccas, the teachers do not give us homework that must be submitted on the next day as they understand that we may be tired. Rulang teaches students special programs out of the school curriculum. For example, they taught us how to play chess, save money, budgeting, being innovative and creative. They host a variety of fun activities within the school to develop us and let us have some fun. They even have 'inclusivity ambassadors' to make sure no one is left out. Rulang's D.A.R.E. values (Self discipline, Adaptability, Respect and Empathy) really helps us to become better people. The teachers there are all unique and special. Some of them may be strict, but they still care for us. Rulang teachers are cheerful and kind. I remember that there was once when it was raining heavily, the teachers held umbrellas to shelter the students from the rain. The food in Rulang is cheap and good too. All in all, Rulang is a good school and they make sure that everyone becomes a better person. Once a Rulangnite, always a Rulangnite!”",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107227121946145112521/reviews
