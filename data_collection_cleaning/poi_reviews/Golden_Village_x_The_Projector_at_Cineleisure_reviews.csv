Jie Ying,5,"Gosh itâ€™s so sad to see the fall of grace of Cineleisure, the place was the IT place in the past where the coolest kids all hang out hereâ€¦ I wasnâ€™t cool so I didnâ€™t hang out here much but I remembered this place being so happening and now itâ€™s just a huge white elephant in Orchard Roadâ€¦

Anyway this isnâ€™t about cine but the projector here is pretty lively thank god. I also cannot stress how much I love that projector provides ENGLISH SUBTITLES. Itâ€™s a need not a want for me so I am glad I found it here",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100764552532273352219/reviews
xuan,5,"freaking love it here. Great food (pretty nice fries), decent selection of drinks too - located on the 5th floor, mcd and a thai eatery located in level 1 of cineleisure.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113374613345190377704/reviews
Honestly,5,"Went to watch an animation called FLOW and surprised Projector has another cinema in Orchard! Happy for them. The place looks really good, very trendy and funky! Though the mall is quite sad, but level 5 and 6 is very happening. There was food and drinks at a cafe but no prices were listed at all.

Found the menu list online at their website, maybe we can all support them at their cafe!

Level 5 n 6 has seating and seriously level 6 has real good views.

The only downer is the toilets so do use the Toilets at the lower floors or at the Mandarin Gallery instead, than the ones at Level 5 and 6 of Cineleisure",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105876852828012901721/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,"Interesting and chill setup tucked away on the 5th floor Orchard Cineleisure! Nice place for a drink and a bite. Love the couches there where my wife and I even played a card game tonight, which was different! Cool portraits around too. This is where the main cinema ticketing counter used to be; the counter is still around but much smaller than before ðŸ˜‰ Thanks for the great service tonight! ðŸ©°",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
oXRYSTALo Ong,5,"Donkey and I decided to explore around the city with our Brompton before heading to CineLeisure. We were blown away by the changes! The familiar Golden Village Cinema had a cool new addition - The Projector, a retro-themed cinema showing everything from old classics to new releases.

We grabbed a round of beers, some sticky Korean fried chicken, and nachos with cheese. The seating area had a fun retro vibe, perfect for relaxing and enjoying our snacks. The staff were so friendly and gave us some great recommendations.  It was awesome that we could take our food and drinks into the cinema, just like at Eagle Cinematics.

The only thing that wasn't perfect was the nacho cheese.  It made the chips a bit soggy when we poured it on. Hopefully, The Projector will fix that for future guests.

The cinema itself was amazing! The seats were super comfy, with options for couples. Even though the nachos weren't ideal, the movie experience was fantastic.  The only minor downside was the shared restrooms on level six, which meant a bit of a wait.

Overall, I'm giving The Projector a tentative five stars. I'm going back soon for a more in-depth review, but so far, I'm really impressed.  We had a great time and can't wait to go back! ðŸ˜Š",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews
