      "text": "My aunt highly recommended us to Listening Lab at Marine Parade where she got her hearing aids. Got dad a pair of hearing aids with the kind help from Vina who patiently let him test and explained details of different models to us. Spent 2.5hrs with her on Thursday afternoon. When we collected the set today, Vina spent another couple of hours to let dad get used to the set and help him adjust. Now dad and aunt can communicate normally and no longer have to shout at each other and guess each otherâ€™s conversation. Such a liberation and worth every cent. Thumbs up to Vina for her excellent service. Thank you! Strongly recommended.",

      "text": "I got a pair of hearing aid  from Vina today. She is very patience when explaining my test result and even give examples on the result interpretation to address my concern. When we tested out my hearing device, she is very helpful  to guide how I can put them on. She gave me time and space to familarise with the device. For devices, from hearing aids, battery, charger and maintenance of hearing aid, she keep repeating the steps. I appreciate her kindness in doing so. Her action enable me to be comfortable with the devices and be make sure I know how to use when I get home. She is a very kind person understand my need and help to address them. I hope friends who need advice on hearing loss can come to seek consultation with her.",
