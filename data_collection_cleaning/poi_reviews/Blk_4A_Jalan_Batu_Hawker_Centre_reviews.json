      "text": "The Best kway chap in SG. Kway is soft but not soggy. Soup is awesome, mildly herbal, with lots of fried garlic bits and Chinese parsley. 2 of us had pork belly, intestine, pig skin, towkwa, egg and 2bowls of kway. All that for $7.\nThe kopi and teh from the kopi stall (facing the road) is also very good; as is the wonton mee stall 2 stalls down, run by a young man. Much better than the wonton mee in the middle aisle with the long queue.\nFYI, less than half the stalls are open in the morning, so limited options.",
