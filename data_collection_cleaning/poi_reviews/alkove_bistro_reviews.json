      "text": "Dining at Alkove was a delightful experience, though the ambiance was quite lively—perhaps a little too much for some.\n\nTheir Vongole Linguine was marvelously cooked—soft, slightly watery, and bursting with rich flavors. A real treat for seafood lovers! The Giant Chicken Schnitzel lived up to its name—huge and wonderfully crispy all over. However, while the crunch was satisfying, the chicken itself could have been better, as it was thinner than expected. The Mushroom Curry was a pleasant surprise, packed with deep, aromatic flavors that elevated the dish beyond expectations.\n\nThat said, the restaurant's atmosphere was quite noisy, with loud music and the chatter of diners almost reaching the point of raised voices. If you’re looking for a quiet, relaxing meal, this might not be the ideal spot.\n\nWe enjoyed a 1-for-1 deal, bringing our total bill from $70+ down to just $50+, making it a great value-for-money meal. Definitely worth checking out if you don’t mind the bustling environment!",

      "text": "Formally known as Ice Edge Café, they have since closed down and rebranded to alkove bistro. @alkove.sg was very popular in Kovan area, due to their French-inspired cuisine and warm, inviting ambiance, coupled with pet-friendly options.\n\nWith their wallet-friendly pricing, they go a step further with set dinner, available daily from 530pm. Order any selected mains from $13.90 onwards and pair with complimentary 1 starter, 1 side & 1 dessert. Food was generally tasty and presented nicely, with dinner set very worth it.",

      "text": "Chance upon this bistro while watching a tiktok video. Imo I wouldn't travel so far just to try something, but I am glad that I had the opportunity to dine at this place. Not upselling but legit this place can try.\n\nWas seated immediately upon arriving (reached at 7pm and i did not make a reservation, will be better if you did) The place is filled and manager mentioned that they are really packed (lucky me)\n\nThey have a dinner set from $13.90 which comes with a soup, side, main and a dessert. Mains aside, the other dishes are smaller than normal but reasonable serving.\n\nWe had beef bolognese pasta with mushroom soup, tater tots and brownie with ice cream ($13.90) and Chicken schnitzel w rice, mushroom soup, truffle fries (+$1.50) and bread pudding with ice cream ($17.90). Pasta is really good but chicken schnitzel is not bad. Pizza looks good though, can consider trying it.\n\nOverall good experience. Worth visiting.",
