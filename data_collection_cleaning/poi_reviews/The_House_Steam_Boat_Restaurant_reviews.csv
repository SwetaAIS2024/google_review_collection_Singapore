Yang,3,"Braised Beef Noodle ($7.80)(Spicy optional)
Chewy noodles in normal savoury broth. Comes with a generous amount of vegetables which are chinese cabbage, black fungus, bok choy and shiitake mushrooms. Load up with a pile of chewy tender succulent beef brisket.
Only thing I like alot is their beef brisket as it has the right texture, mouthwatering and effortlessly comes off from the bone.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews
