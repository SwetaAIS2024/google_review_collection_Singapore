However, this one was actually pretty good. Given the price, the quantity of the noodles, ingredients, and taste was above average.\n\nLook at the noodles, the glaze, the saucy look, and the springy feel, doesn't it make one hungry. It tasted delicious! Ordered the usual, vinegar, chili, and vinegar, and one can taste the delicious 3 flavours, it was pretty well balanced!\n\nThey were generous with the ingredients as well. The fishballs and the fishcakes were nice, firm, and bouncy. They even threw in a piece of fried tofu skin, rare to see it in the fishball noodles, nice touch!\n\n‚ú® Ambience wise: Coffee Shop!\n\nü§µüèª Service wise: Great! Really friendly!\n\nüíµ Price wise: $4.00",
