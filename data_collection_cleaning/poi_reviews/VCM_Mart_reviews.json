Had gone there few times & wished EVERYTIME  that it was some other cashier who would be there. But never. It would be him.\n\nIt seems that he preferred paying customer instead of us who are collecting Shopee parcels. He would be talking to them. But when its my turn, he took out the business hp, kept his MOUTH SHUT & STARED at me..\n\nI was like.. what the xxxx is wrong with you?! I had even greeted you with ‘Hello’, which is a norm when i go to any collection point.\n\nMy goodness..Shopee should delist this shop as a collection point.. but i think it wouldnt happen. So I made a promise that I will NOT EVER deal or shop here again.",

      "text": "I picked up an item from a shop today, and the shopkeeper gave me a very grumpy look, as though I was disturbing him. I noticed he was busy restocking cigarettes at the counter behind him, but I can't understand why this caused such an attitude. This isn’t the first time it has happened. In the past, I usually brushed it off as it didn’t affect me much. However, today I started paying more attention, especially since I’ve seen so many negative reviews about this shop as a Shopee collection point—and it seems those reviews are accurate.",

The last time I went, the cashier asked me to find my own package, then scolded me for moving his packages around, which he placed scattered on the floor. Just use the pick lockers at Blk 203/265.",
