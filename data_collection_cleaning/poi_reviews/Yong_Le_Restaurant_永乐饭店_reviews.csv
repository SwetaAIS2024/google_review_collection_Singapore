Stephen Chia,5,"Just tried Yong Le Restaurantâ€™s chicken chop rice. Incredibly juicy, tasty and yummy with complimentary thick & creamy tomyum soup for dipping. The steamed rice was soft and appetising, such a perfect match while eating with the chicken chop. The price is reasonable and worthy for the yummy food. Highly recommended.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106871287567931981088/reviews
