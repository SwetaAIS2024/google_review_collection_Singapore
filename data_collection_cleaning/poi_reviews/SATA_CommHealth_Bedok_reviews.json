      "text": "Avoid online or physical consultation with SATA clinic. My wife and I are absolutely frustrated and disappointed with the lack of professionalism and care at this clinic. It is clear that their main focus is on making money rather than offering proper medical advice or care. My wife’s experience with Dr. Joseph Rajendran (MCR: M14313H) and Dr. Mohd Aizat Bin Muhammad Tajudin (MCR: M19394A) was nothing short of a nightmare.\n\nFirst, my wife saw Dr. Rajendran yesterday. She had period cramps and had requested two days of medical leave. Given her history of endometriosis, which severely affects her period cramps, she already had proper medication prescribed by KKH. Dr. Rajendran only issued a one-day MC and insisted that she come back the next day if the pain persisted. He did not push any medication on her, which was fine since she had the appropriate treatment. However, the real trouble started today with Dr. Aizat.\n\nToday, my wife decided to rest for another day due to her ongoing cramps. Her employer, who is aware of her endometriosis, even encouraged her to take the additional day of rest. When my wife explained this to Dr. Aizat, he completely disregarded her medical history and the fact that she already had prescribed medication. Instead of being understanding or professional, Dr. Aizat insisted that she take his medication, or he would not issue the medical certificate. This was completely absurd and unprofessional!\n\nHow can a doctor force medication on a patient who has an existing treatment plan that works? This is a blatant attempt to push unnecessary prescriptions to profit from the consultation. We were absolutely shocked by his attitude and lack of respect for my wife’s autonomy as a patient. It is unethical to pressure patients into taking medication they don’t need. We, as patients, have every right to decline medication, especially when it is not required, and we already have prescribed treatment.\n\nI’m beyond frustrated that instead of focusing on the well-being of my wife, these doctors seemed far more concerned about their bottom line. It was clear that Dr. Aizat’s priority was making money, not providing care. It’s an absolute disgrace that this is what we’ve come to expect from a clinic that should be helping people. I would strongly advise against consulting Dr. Aizat or any doctor at SATA clinic. If you value your health and respect, stay far away from this place.",

Luna is nice which explains to me the procedure of my health screen. Then the medical assistants are all helpful and gentle , applause for the nurse who took my blood sample in painless way.",

      "text": "My wife's usual place for her scheduled Mammograms. Very expedited process. She registered for it at 0830hrs and everything was completed at 0930 hrs. The air-conditioning in the actual mammogram examination room was not working but they tried to mitigate the situation with a stand fan and small cooler unit. The mammogram OIC personnel profusely apologised for the discomfort, although the situation was beyond her control. Overall my wife was highly satisfied with her visit. Personally as an Easterner, this SATA is an iconic landmark as I remember of the old SATA clinic that was situated here 50 years ago when I lived in the Old Chai Chee area.",

They made us feel at ease, and they were very patient and kind with me as I had lost my voice and couldn’t speak at all. Receptionist Chin Hui Hui went above and beyond and even gave me a bottle of green tea cos she said I needed to drink more water. Really really thankful to them for the great experience.",

The entire process was highly efficient, with minimal waiting time and well-organized procedures. The staff ensured that everything flowed smoothly from registration to the consultation.\n\nThe check-up itself was fast without feeling rushed. The medical team was professional and attentive, taking the time to address any concerns while maintaining a brisk pace to keep things moving.",
