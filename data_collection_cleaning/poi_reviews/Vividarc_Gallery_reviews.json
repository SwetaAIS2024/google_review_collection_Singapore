The class is different from normal cookies classes as it teaches us to make cookies using the “clay marbling” technique that the artist uses to create his artpiece. A fun and enjoyable time with friends and family",

Yet, the visual beauty offered a rare calmness and serenity, a welcome escape from the chaos of everyday life.\nA visit here is worthwhile — you may uncover an artistic soul you never knew you had.",
