gevs,4,I was strolling along chinatown in Singapore after dinner and found this place tucked away discreetly at a corner lot. It was quiet since the party going crowd will not be in until much later. Had a drink here and I can honestly say the price here is much affordable than the other watering holes I have come across in Singapore.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116861028214034324976/reviews

Markus Klar,1,"Disgusting staff. Have no plan what they do. Wait forever for ordering a drink. Order a drink at 2:55am finally. 18$ and gave 2$ tip.
Then I sit down, at 3am the staff came to my table and Stole my glass and throw it into to the sink. Without any explanation or prewarning.
As I said I wanna complain to another guy, they said this is the manger and he is crazy and I should be quiet because they want to go back there (only gay place open until 3 am, the other just until 1am)

They might need it, I highly recommend not to go there at all. Weekend is also super overcrowded. Tantric is closed but they just use the reputation tantric had.

They could make so much money with that bar with staff, who are nice and know what they do and want to work at all.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100845355627828047064/reviews
Dean Selway,1,"Super rude staff, all seats empty but not allowed sit down as apparently reserved even though they were still empty when we left. Staff really unhelpful and made us feel unwelcome. Spend your money somewhere else.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102090699420367420153/reviews
GS Loh,5,"I always have a great time here with my friends. The staff are so friendly, accommodating and attentive although a bit hard when it gets very crowded on weekend nights. Good range of drinks and food, fun music and movies played on multiple screens throughout. All 'types' of people will feel welcome here so it is also a nice place to people watch. Come hang out here y'all! :)",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117827805515408148479/reviews
