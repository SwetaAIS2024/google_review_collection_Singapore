      "text": "Was there on a Saturday night. After checking out, my daughter put the items into a plastic bag. The staff (an older aunty), grabbed the plastic bag off my daughter's hands. Only after I told her and she realizing there were items in the plastic bag did she go off in a puff. Very unnecessary encounter and very rude. Daiso needs to retrain their staff at this outlet badly. Would have given a 1 star, had it not been for the items sold there which are quite nice and affordable. Staff need to watch their attitude, and not be condescending to kids just because they are kids. Daiso management needs to take notice.",
