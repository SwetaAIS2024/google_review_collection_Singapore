      "text": "I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional service provided by Mr Harry and Mr Afiq.  Mr Harry's extensive product knowledge, particularly regarding various air cons, allowed me to confidently make a purchase. He patiently explained the pros and cons of various models and, beyond air con, offered valuable guidance on choosing a suitable water heater.  Mr Afiq's service was equally impressive; he efficiently handled the payment process and ensured the air con installation appointment was scheduled to meet our needs.  Courts is fortunate to have such dedicated and knowledgeable employees.  I highly recommend them.üëçüèªüëçüèªüíØ",

He took the time to listen to my needs and carefully explained the features and differences between the items I was interested in. He provided thoughtful recommendations and guided me through the selection process, especially when I was choosing a mattress and an electric kettle. His knowledge and professionalism made the decision much easier. I truly appreciated his friendly attitude and excellent customer service.üòä",

      "text": "I was looking for an ipad and came across ipad promotion at this branch. After browsing the options available, we were attended by Mr Koh Xiong Hui who helped advise us on our choices. He's knowledgeable and was able to evaluate the requirement needed for my usage. I bought an ipad air 13\" 256GB as the 512GB has no stock and will have to wait a month or more.  Xiong Hui was helpful and friendly. He even helped out the cashier to count the bank vouchers which I included during my payment. I went again to Courts Jurong Point just last Friday to get the Pro-Pencil that my girl requested. Xiong Hui immediately help out with the retrieving of the stock till ensuring the payment are smooth, he did the packing and also help out to ensure I collected my LPrivilege points. The sales transaction is smooth and pleasant. I would recommend Xiong Hui to my friends if they are looking for any IT gadgets at Courts JP.",
