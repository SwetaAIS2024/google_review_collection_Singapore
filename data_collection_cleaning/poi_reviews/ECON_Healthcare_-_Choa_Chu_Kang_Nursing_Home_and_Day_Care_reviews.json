      "text": "A relative of mine got bruises from staying here when her diapers were being changed or when she had guided exercise, and she can’t speak or point it out due to dementia, so it was only discovered when her diapers were changed the next day. No nurses owned up to it, and no responsibility taken. Previously her finger was in bandages because they cut it while attempting to cut her nails. It’s hard to tell if they really care. ON TOP OF THAT, they did not pay for the ambulance and XRay costs. You’re injuring residents and getting their families to pay for medical costs. It would be better if you’d just close down.",
