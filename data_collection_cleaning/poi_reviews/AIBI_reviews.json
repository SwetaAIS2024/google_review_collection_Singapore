I have been calling them to get replacement parts for my Waterrower but can’t reach anybody. When I called one of Aibi’s retail shop, I was given the same customer service number and that’s it. The lady just asked me to keep calling this number. I called them two months ago, no one answer and a couple of later - no one answer.",
