The service was impeccable, with friendly and attentive staff. The food presentation was visually appealing. We ordered the CNY set menu, and all the dishes were enjoyable. Personally, I preferred the white pepper lobster to the black pepper version. The white pepper offered a subtle, nuanced flavor that wasn't overpowering, although I would have preferred some white rice to accompany it as the lobster itself was slightly salty on its own",

      "text": "Don’t wait—visit soon while it’s still a hidden gem!\n\nI recently visited this newly opened restaurant (just two months old!) for Saturday lunch and tried Set A at $88. Let me tell you—it was worth every penny. By the end of the meal, I was so full I had to unfasten my belt, thanks to the generous and absolutely delicious portions. I’ve paid double elsewhere for far less satisfying meals, so this was a delightful surprise.\n\nWhat makes this place special? Their chef, hailing from Tianjin, has worked in a Michelin-starred restaurant before, and it truly shows in the quality and creativity of the dishes.\n\nHighlights of the meal:\n\n•\tIberico Pork: So tender it literally melts in your mouth.\n•\tPaofan: Warm, comforting, and packed with flavor—pure perfection.\n•\t“Orh Nee” with a Twist: Their innovative take uses sweet potato instead of yam, offering a modern yet nostalgic dessert experience.\n\nThe overall dining experience feels luxurious, with stunning tableware and a tranquil setting nestled among lush greenery. It’s a hidden oasis that’s easy to reach if you’re driving.\n\nEven better, the tea is reasonably priced—a whole pot for just $6 (finally, a restaurant that doesn’t overcharge for tea!).\n\nSpecial shoutout to our server, Ray. His attentiveness and knowledge of the food elevated our experience. You can tell he’s a foodie himself!\n\nThey also have a Chinese New Year menu coming up, so it’s the perfect time to check this place out. With their fresh start and Michelin-starred expertise, I have no doubt this restaurant will quickly become a favorite for anyone seeking incredible food at a fantastic value.\n\nP/S: Please give me a thumbs up if you like my recommendation, I’m curious to know if you guys feel the same!",
