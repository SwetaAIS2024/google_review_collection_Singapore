Panaché Panache,5,"This is the most delicious barchor noodles of the entire punggol. The Xiaomei who serves during midnight supper makes the best noodles in Singapore, her sauce is always accurate, not too salty not too blend, perfect.
She's always friendly, and that's e reason why everyone enjoy her noodles in this stall too. 10 🌟😋

But there's a difference if it's day time order it cannot beat the 12am supper noodle. That's why I only visit after 11pm Best 👍👍👍👍👍",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104429447252353713430/reviews
Bryan Fang,4,"Ordered a minced meat noodle and added fishballs. Total $5.30

Noodles were slightly overcooked for my preference. Chilli sauce was nice. Bowl comes with a good amount of ingredients. Fishballs are good thus I added, 2pcs $1.30, slightly expensive for fishballs though.

Stall is open 24hrs so no worries even if you are hungry late at night in this area.

Overall I still enjoyed the noodles but don't have to specially travel for this.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114490699769830179262/reviews
