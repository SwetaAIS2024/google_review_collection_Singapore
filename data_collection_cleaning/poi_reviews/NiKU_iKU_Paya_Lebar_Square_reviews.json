Having the website ordering is helpful too as the wait can be a bit long.\n\nNote: the packaging is not microwave-safe as indicated, I put it in my microwave without the foil top but it started sparking even under 30secs! (Thankfully I was watching it) Best to transfer it to another dish before reheating.",

      "text": "Food is honestly decent (very hard to go wrong with yakiniku beef) but the wait is terrible. Arrived at ~ 730pm with no queue, but had to wait a whole 20min for it to cook and collected it at ~750pm.\n\nI personally watched it cook, and the grill clearly has a heating issue. This is yakiniku style beef which typically takes seconds to cook, but somehow it really took a whole 20min to cook…\n\nAnd the food wasn’t well cooked either. In the 20min I stood in front of the grill I saw salmon sticking to grills when being flipped (grill was not oiled enough) and pumpkins slices being burnt…\n\nFor most “grab and go” places people expect food fast. If you’re looking for speed I would not recommend this place.",
