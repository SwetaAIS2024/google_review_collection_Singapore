Only one person at priority counter and the rest of the counters are unmanned at 12 noon (lunch crowd) on a weekday.\n\nWhen I took picture of empty counters, security guard came to threaten me to delete the photo for “security of the bank”. Sir this is Singapore and got so many camera, when was the last bank robbery case? More likely because of all the other google review photos showing their unmanned counters and poor service! Don’t want to expose themselves to their HQ because this branch is terrible.\n\nI opened SC since 2013. Now closing all my accounts.",

      "text": "This is my first time stepping into Standard Chartered for personal banking on behalf of my parents. I must say I’m appalled at the kind of service that is provided at the front reception. Both front staff are competent and able, but are so task oriented that I felt I was in Hong Kong in a Chinese restaurant, where if I didn’t state what I need clearly or concisely I would get ignored or be given a frown. After stating the nature of my visit, the counter staff wanted to find out what I wanted. As it involved some legal matters, they were adamant tand at a point, it felt like I could not even interrupt him.\n\nAfter getting the front counter behind me, the staff just looked on and i didn’t know if I should proceed behind, I guess it’s the simple things that make a difference. In the end, when I made it to the counter, the counter staff was really polite and helpful and i got what I needed. I guess based on first impressions, I felt pretty intimidated by the reception staff as it could be I wasn’t clear or they just had to much to do, I was worried at a point they would turn me away because I asked for something that i needed help with or wasn’t sure about.\n\nIt was all good in the end, but I wished the reception staff was all polite and helpful because it was so much easier and certainly less tense on my part when I got to the counter and the matter took 5 minutes to complete.\n\nI would say first impressions matter.",
