iris,5,"a happy hour pub with friendly and attentive staff. great place to hang out after work. i loved the mortadella double crust pizza ($18) that we had. the dough was very good. i can eat it on its own. i highly recommend the tiramisu, too ($10). it’s boozy but somehow well balanced.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103358886094489340512/reviews
Lirene Bay,5,"Had a super satisfying lunch at ERWIN'S Gastrobar, and their 2-Course ($24) & 3-Course ($28) Set Menu is such a steal!

For starters, we had the Mushroom Arancini with Truffle Aioli (crispy, flavorful, and absolutely addictive) and the Bistro Salad (fresh mix of tomato, cucumber, and red onion – a light and refreshing start).

Mains were a total hit! The Australian Beef Brisket Panino di Focaccia was packed with flavor—juicy brisket, giardiniera sauce, provolone cheese, caramelized onion, and crisp romaine lettuce all sandwiched in fluffy focaccia. The Baked Salmon Risotto was rich, creamy, and loaded with broccoli, pesto, and Parmigiana—comfort food at its best.

Of course, we couldn't skip dessert, and the Homemade Tiramisu with Stout Caramel & Organic Cocoa Powder was simply irresistible. Soft, creamy, and just the right amount of sweetness.

To top it all off, we grabbed their smoothies for a refreshing finish:
🍓 Berry Smoothie – a sweet, tangy blend of mixed berries, banana, yogurt & honey.
🥝 Green Smoothie – a fresh, detoxifying mix of kiwi, green apple, spinach, celery & banana.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102213924345193254932/reviews

Ngl, ordered this when I saw that it has pistachio pesto sauce 😆 The sauce is relatively nutty with ground pistachio nuts and the grilled cauliflower is tender with smokey charred bits

𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐚𝐧 & 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐛 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧
Crispy and juicy fried chicken but slightly on the saltish side due to the parmesan. Paired with cacio e pepe mayo which is slightly tangy and cheesy

The staff told us that we picked the best seller from the double crust pizza series and it certainly didnt disappoint! I was worried it would be too doughy since it has 2 layers of crust but thankfully it’s not 😁 The crust is pretty crispy around the edges and not overly thick and comes with mortadella, truffle and cheese filling in between. Couldn’t help but reach out for more slices 😋

The sauce is made from prawn emulsion and seaweed butter and topped with cherry tomatoes and herb pangratatto. Personally prefer stronger seafood flavour for that extra oomph as the flavour is a little milder compared to the rest of the dishes imo

This also came highly recommended by the staff and I could see why. Note that it has pretty strong alcohol flavour so if you are not a fan of alcohol, you may not like it. I personally like it! 😁

M *,3,"The place is good for happy hour, bottled wine and snacks after hour. For lunch, the onion soup can be skipped, pasta is overcooked. Beef burger & chips is nicely made. Salmon is a bit overcooked.  Drinks are charged as it’s infused but no one charging water anymore with the name if infused.  Lunch set is not cheapest and need to pay extra for other drinks
Overall.. can stick to happy hours drinks and snacks.  Lunch can be better with the price charged",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103330821176864508073/reviews
kyra,4,"we went on new year’s eve, and we got baked salmon and carbonara.

baked salmon was very healthy. It had spinach, brown rice and some mashed tomatoes on the side. rice was a bit dry, but the rest tasted fine. the sides were a good complement to the salmon. the skin was crispy and the fish was soft and tasty

carbonara was good on first try, but was a bit too creamy after a few bites.

nachos was very good! but the portion size was too big for two. recommend to order when there’s more people.

mozzarella cheese sticks were crispy and the cheese was melty and could be pulled! eat it hot though, if not it becomes quite bland",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109921869539496928368/reviews
