HOLY MACARONI MAMMAMIA,4,"Hi, Kheng Xing Fei here. I graduated from here in 2023. This school is quite good, but there’s a lot of toxic and mean people that make it seem like a bad school. The counselors are actually quite empathetic! I highly recommend. Many teachers are nice too, especially the art teachers. I’ve acted a little bit childish but they’ve found it amusing and honestly, I like it when people are entertained.

The toxicity of some students have brought me in very bad mental shape. Ever since they’ve been friends with me, it has affected my personality and I was not aware of it until my friends outside of this school accused me of acting rude.

This school is quite clean! The food and beverages they sell is totally worth the price. The students get pretty good discipline when they do something wrong.(my personal experience that included myself getting disciplined.)

If you live somewhere near this school, do consider signing your child up for this school.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105847503645320438194/reviews
