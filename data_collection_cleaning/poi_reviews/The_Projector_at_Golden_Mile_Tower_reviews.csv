daezjn,5,"My all time favourite art cinema in Singapore!- a pioneer of this niche. Great eclectic interior with a noble nod to maintain the original retro fixtures and details with a friendly casual service (unusual for Singapore lol). A nice place to hang at after or before a movie with friends.They feature film festivals and animation festivals as well as some popular blockbusters and old cult films. There’s a bean bag cinema which is a nice change if you want to try something different. They serve hot food, sweet or savory popcorn and alcohol that can be taken to the cinema which is a big plus :) Some comedy and concert events also happen here which is a nice intimate experience. Highly recommend subscribing to their membership!!! Keep Projector going!!! There was talks in the past that this location will be knocked down but so glad this beautiful building still remain standing- they just don’t make them like they used to. There is also a flashy Bollywood cinema downstairs. Do checkout the overall building and architecture. It’s rather fascinating to explore.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109735352192765094777/reviews

Peter Henderson,5,"Coolest theater in Singapore with the best selection of films. Prices are decent by SG standards. Discounts for some movies like their current $6 valentine's day special.

In love with the atmosphere. So happy they kept the original character of the theater while adding their own flare on top. Also I love how steep the theater seating is. No problems with someone tall getting in the way, and you feel quite separated from the rows above and below you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114092795270809997516/reviews
Spencer Paw,4,"The size and comfort of the seats leave much to be desired. However, they show some older shows and classics from time to time besides the usual now showing stuff, definitely give them a follow on social media to keep up to date on what's up! In recent memory, I went for the Ari Aster movies, Oldboy, and The Grand Budapest Hotel. Can't wait for the Martin Scorsese season!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106133221641148569526/reviews
