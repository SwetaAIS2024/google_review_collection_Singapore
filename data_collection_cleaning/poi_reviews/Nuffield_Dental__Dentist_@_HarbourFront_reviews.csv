Magdeline Sim,5,"I recently had my wisdom tooth removed by Dr. Faisal at Nuffield Dental, and I couldn’t be more pleased with the whole experience. From start to finish, the process was smooth, professional, and painless. Dr. Faisal was very reassuring and took the time to explain everything to me clearly, which put me at ease before the procedure.

The staff at Nuffield Dental were incredibly friendly and empathetic. They made sure I was comfortable throughout my visit and provided detailed explanations about the procedure and the aftercare, so I felt confident going into recovery.

This was actually my second visit to Nuffield for a wisdom tooth extraction, having been treated by a different dentist for the first one. I was pleased to find that the quality of care and consistency of the process were just as excellent as my first visit. It’s comforting to know I can rely on Nuffield Dental for high-quality care every time.

Highly recommend Nuffield Dental, especially if you need a wisdom tooth extraction. Thank you, Dr. Faisal and the wonderful team, for making it such a positive experience!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108921733045858526521/reviews
Vicky Zhang,5,"I was in serious pain when I arrived, but the receptionist kindly helped arrange the earliest possible time slot for me. Big thanks to Dr. Chung for his amazing surgical skills—I barely felt a thing and almost fell asleep during the procedure! He said it would take around half an hour, and it was finished right on time. I'm truly grateful for Dr. Chung's gentle reassurance and exceptional technique—it really helped ease a lot of the pain. For anyone who's ever experienced tooth pain, you know just how unbearable it can be.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115299393351612250410/reviews
