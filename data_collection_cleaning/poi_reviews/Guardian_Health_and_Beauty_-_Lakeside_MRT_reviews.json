      "text": "I said \"no carrier\" at the counter (which means no plastic bag).\n\nBut the counter staff says Guardian must charge 10 cents for all plastic bags. I'm like, no, I don't want the plastic bag.\n\nThe counter staff insists I pay the 10 cents, \"must buy the plastic bag\".\n\nI asked: \"if no matter what u buy, you die die (always) must get a plastic bag?\" They said yes.\n\nI paid for my item. And after they pack the item for me, they then said \"if you don't want the plastic bag, say 'hand carry'.\"\n\nI already made it clear I don't want a plastic bag, but got one under the staff's insistence.\n\n-----\n\nFirst, Guardian is real nice; This review ain't about sh*tting about them as a whole. Do not pinpoint them over this.\n\nGuardian, please clarify: do all customers need to pay for the plastic bag regardless they want it or not, or is getting the plastic bag is optional?\n\nI hope you can also make sure all staff are clear about your plastic bag procedures too, so confusion like this won't arise.\n\nThanks üôè",
