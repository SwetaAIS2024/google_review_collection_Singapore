      "text": "I highly recommend this clinic for their outstanding care and professionalism. The doctors here truly take their time to diagnose thoroughly and even follow up after consultations. Special thanks to Dr. Mark and Dr. Lo, who went above and beyond for my family.\n\nI had difficulty breathing and initially thought it was prolonged COVID symptoms. Thankfully, they suspected an asthma attack and immediately referred me to the hospital. indeed, they were right. My daughter also had a persistent fever and abdominal pain for over a week, and they suspected appendicitis. She was referred for further checks, and Dr. Mark personally followed up on her progress, which was truly reassuring.\n\nThis is definitely a clinic I trust for their medical expertise, dedication, and genuine care for their patients. Highly recommended! üëèüëèüëè",
