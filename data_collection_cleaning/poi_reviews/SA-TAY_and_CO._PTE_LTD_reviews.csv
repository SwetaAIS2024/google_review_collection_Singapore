oh chia wee,1,"One of the worst stall in lagoon. Chicken wings are burnt and taste extremely sweet.
And the gentleman who is taking order should take a break if he is having a bad day.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105323532906123536185/reviews

Leslie Tng,1,"Food was served cold after waiting so long. Ordered the satay, squid, prawn. Squid had a weird tasting to it, didnâ€™t even finish it. There were a few sticks of prawn undercooked. Would suggest the patrons to take a look at other stalls first before rushing in to place your orders with this stall.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105021389823223131856/reviews
chrispy creme,1,"terrible service. bossman swarmed us immediately asking us questions on what we wanted. said we ordered 30$ worth of prawns based off what a 12 year old answered to a question posed as dietary preferences. guilt tripped us by saying the prawns were already on the grill 3 mins after we sat and we didnâ€™t even get to officially order.

food is mid as well, passable but not worth the price. there are many satays in the sea. not only that, but bossman is short as well. -1 star.

overall, please go to another store. i think most people get trapped here because he scouts them and swarms them before even sitting down. itâ€™s like a tourist trap but the locals also get stuck in the honey which is his cordial nature. he is not ur abang. he is a capitalist.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118193965300106399056/reviews
hasininininininininini,1,"tourist trap except for locals as well, overpriced as hell for shabby food and the service is even worse. who misunderstands and trusts a child to order for a group of people and uses it as an excuse to say you have already put the food on the grill? shame on you and your whole establishment ðŸ‘Ž",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105939123238999893867/reviews
