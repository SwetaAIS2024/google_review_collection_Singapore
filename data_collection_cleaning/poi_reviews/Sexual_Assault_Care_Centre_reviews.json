From the legal clinics to counselling sessions, all the staff involved have been very sensitive and understanding of our trauma and difficulties. We are truly grateful for the help.\n\nIf possible, it would be good for the SACC to offer subsidized therapy as healing from trauma requires deeper work with the psyche of each individual.",
