Lukas LimCheeHao,5,"This is my go to coffeeshop for convenience. I'm often happy with the standards of the food served and the service is good. I usually go to the western and noodle store to enjoy my meals but sometimes also try economy rice and fish soup. I don't really like the price of the drinks I feel it is too expensive, but overall I like this place am often frequently eat here",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111490473045279623284/reviews

Chen Carina,3,"Came specially for wanton Mee but was disappointed. First, stall only opens at 9am on Sun, had arrived earlier and thought it was closed so I ordered other food. Ordered dim sum from Kimly which I feel is expected taste and slightly below standard of other branches. Avoid the Lor Mai Kai, was dry and hard... Can have the Chee Cheong Fun and Har Gow, porridge and Siew was ok. Also had wanton Mee when it opened.Taste was ok? Sauce not too bad, char Siew is just char Siew...most appealing is the wantons (but note lotsa celery inside). Soup is veryyy anchovy for those who like it. $4.50 is too expensive for me. Would not come specially for this. Parking available at next door mscp. Coffee and tea not too bad. Note that no Muslim food here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111996576432815242881/reviews
Marcus Nah,3,"So far the wanton mee still acceptable.. even standard down quite some..

But the most disappointed and disgusting part is that their serving tray is very dirty.. use one after another and wash just anyhow wipe it by the cleaner.. just one wipe from that cloth to clean table and whatever.. Seriously if can I won't want to use their tray..

Trust me if u see how that wipe their tray.. you won't use it also.. this applies to  many food centre, kopitiam, coffee shop and etc..",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108851483842225070997/reviews
