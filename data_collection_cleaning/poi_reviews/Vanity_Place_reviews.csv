vogue,5,"It is my first time doing facial with Kelly. She is very knowledgeable and takes time to explain the different treatments she offers. I opted for the Bojin facial which stimulates the meridian points on the face, resulting in an uplifting effect and radiant glow on the skin. I also enjoyed the relaxing back and facial massages. Kelly even provided me with samples for moisturizing after the session. Will definitely be back again for more facial treatment with her. Thank you Kelly!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102133270871010319339/reviews

Fluffy Kitty,5,"It was the best facial experience I’ve had! Kelly was really friendly and talked me through on what are my skin needs. She suggested some add ons that will suit my skin type and gave me options to choose from. No hard sell! All is up to the customer’s choice. She was very thorough throughout the session. The massage was a full on massage and I nearly fell asleep. Also, during the mask session, it was so cooling that I did sleep XD Genuinely will return again! Definitely worth the money :) oh! And she gave some samples for me to try based on what she felt my skin really needs and a free Xmas gift. Loved it!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117414297907866959872/reviews
