JY Lee,4,"Dosai was tasty and not bland. Prata was thick kind, could be fluffier and more soft but its just personal preference. Just a little bit pricier but their portion makes up for it. Will be back if in the area",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106976672219961391837/reviews
benfongwz,5,"If you're looking for an old school pratashop, the kind you used to go to after school, this is it. Rustic, tasty, great service. Got 1 plain prata, 1 egg prata, 1 vadai, 1 fried ball and an iced teh tarik.

Pratas were great; plain was crispy and fluffy, egg was soft, both not too oily. Don't expect Springleaf crispiness for the plain but that's probably not why you're here anyway. Vadai is on the softer side, lentil batter and not the overly fried kind trending nowadays; fragrant. Fried ball was a miss for me, I expected a banana ball but was greeted by a dough ball dipped in rose syrup. Insides were still undercooked too and a little gummy. Teh tarik was fantastic, the tea is so fragrant and the milk is nice and light from the pulls. Put some ice and you have a good day ahead of you.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113339087508373682807/reviews
Seah Jun Kang,1,Service was great. Immediately changed teh tarik at our complain of no tea taste. After the change it still tasted the same just with more bubbles. Atmosphere was great. Feels like JB. Prata looks good just not the teh tarik.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106412941335850988703/reviews
Dylan Li,5,"We got a couple of roti pratas as a snack, and they were tasty and reasonably priced!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227455027475284936/reviews
Jeremy Matthew,5,Freshly made prata that is crispy and flaky for the kosong and the egg is chewy. Served with 2 different curries and a sweet chili makes it a wonderful meal for breakfast or tea break. Definitely one of the better prata places in Singapore.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115671130290204222423/reviews
