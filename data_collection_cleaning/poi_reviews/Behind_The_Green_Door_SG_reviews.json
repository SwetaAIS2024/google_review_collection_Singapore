A lively crowd, nice decor and atmosphere contribute to it being a highly popular place these days.\n\nThe service staff are attentive and vigilant, making it overall a very desirable place to go to for clubbing.",

      "text": "The night turned out to be quite expensive. The entrance fee alone was $65 without any drinks included. On top of that, two gin and tonics cost about $48. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t manage to stay long enough for the guest DJ to arrive. The place itself wasnâ€™t as fantastic as expected, especially given the high prices. Ventilation was poor, making it quite uncomfortable inside. Overall, not my favorite place to visit â€” definitely not worth the premium.",
