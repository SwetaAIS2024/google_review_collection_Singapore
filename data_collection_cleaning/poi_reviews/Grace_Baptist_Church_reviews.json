So far three for three have been a pleasant experience, facilities all clean, auditorium is beautiful and sound system worked with no hiccups. If you’re coming here for an event do note that parking is very limited so either come early or park nearby. I parked at Mattar MRT Surface CP, a 8-10min walk away, for free parking.",

Biblical expositional preaching, strong Sunday liturgy, beautiful worship with meaningfully rich songs. Multigenerational and large congregation. An excellent church to attend on Sunday even if you are visiting Singapore. Also very convenient since it’s just a couple minutes walking by the Blue Line Mattar Rd station",
