The Roasted Pork was crispy on the outside the meat was very juicy and tender! I hardly eat roasted duck but I enjoyed every bite of it. The skin was crisp and meat was tender too. The Chinese sausage was very nice too! The portion was good and price was affordable too! Will come back for this signature again!",

Ordered roast meat from this stall. They did not get them from the front where they show the meat) instead they get them from the back end. I called him out but he denies that.\n\nLo and behold. The meat was dry. Never coming back..",

      "text": "I am a long-term customer here. The chicken rice is delicious, but the rice given to me has become less recently. I bought it 4 times. Except for the second time, the rice was normal, and the rice was missing the other 3 times. I told the people at the stall today that the food was short. Andy replied to me, do you want more food? I said no. The food you gave me was less than before. How could Andy get back to me? I said it was just missing, and the handsome guy who was chopping chicken next to me said it didn't matter and gave me some extra rice.\nOther regular customers must have noticed this problem, but they didn't care about it, but I couldn't because I couldn't feel full with less food.\nAndy has a bad attitude. Treat customers well and customers will treat you well.",
