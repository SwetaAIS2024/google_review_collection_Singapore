I felt good doing my services here and was very comfortable with my therapist Alice. Will surely visit again! Thumbs up üëçüèª\n\nBack for the second time and this time round with the most friendly therapist Meiting. She is so attentive to details and made the whole experience 10/10.

Some eyelash extensions fall off easily, for peony Tokyo it doesn‚Äôt seems the case. Very happy with the service, due to lack of time I didn‚Äôt try the 3D-5D eyelash extensions which are their signature, will definitely give it a try after my trip. Lastly, did i mention their first time trial price is very very friendly for the wallet.",
