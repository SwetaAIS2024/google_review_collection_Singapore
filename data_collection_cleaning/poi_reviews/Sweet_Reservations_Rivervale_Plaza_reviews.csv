Minjun Hwang,5,"The staff here was very helpful. I got an incorrect menu served at first, but he immediately accepted my claim and re-served a correct one. Injeolmi bingsu tastes wonderful.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117767570280157642812/reviews
Malcom Neo,5,"Amazing dessert place hidden in rivervale.

I suggest you go for the large and the small seems small even for 1. If you have a sweet tooth, small isnt enough for you

The matcha bingsu was amazing. The matcha powder is thick and the ice cream is amazing. No wonder they sell ice cream only too. The ice was milky and smooth.

Highly recommended and i will travel there to have it again",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103408820420094292372/reviews

GG Gallium,5,"Great dessert, so yummy and delicious. We got the milo bingsu, kind service lady and patient when i wanted to use CDC vouchers. Bingsu was great i will return to try out the other flavours!

Place can be more cooling though! Aircon/Fan üòÅ",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115366756105540671160/reviews
Cad Koh,5,"The large bingsu is priced affordably at $11-$13 (Good for 2-3 pax sharing) and the small one at $7-8 (Max 1 person portion I feel). The ice shavings are rather sweet and not bland unlike some of the bingsu place. Toppings were generous for the pricing as well (See from the pictures) Totally enjoyed both the Mango and Choco banana bingsu I have eaten on 2 separate occasions. Hard to find a nice and affordable bingsu place in Seng kang. Pictured the speculoo ice cream $4.50/scoop (price varies for diff flavours) and Yuzu tea.

I totally recommend this place!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107512444785836022725/reviews
