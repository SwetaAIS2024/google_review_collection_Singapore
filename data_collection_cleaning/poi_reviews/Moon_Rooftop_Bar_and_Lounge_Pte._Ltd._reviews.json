      "text": "My daughter brought me to Moon restaurant as i have craving for seafood. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, with soft lighting and a colossal moon looming overhead, as if torn from the sky and hung from the ceiling.\n\nThe service was exceptional‚Äîattentive without being intrusive. An qi was friendly, knowledgeable, and made thoughtful recommendations that perfectly matched our tastes.\n\nAs for the food, every dish was a standout. We started with oysters which were really juicy and fresh.  I had my lobster and my daughter had wagyu steak. She loved to have her steak rare and it was indeed cooked to her liking. Both of us loved the truffles fries. We will go again to try their crispy pork belly and other dishes.\n\nOverall, Moon restaurant exceeded expectations in every way. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a drinking session, a celebration spot, or simply a great meal, I‚Äôd highly recommend it.",

      "text": "The views here are pretty spectacular! Very serene when it‚Äôs not crowded. A bit pricey but I guess you can justify it as paying for the ambiance and views.\nService by the two ladies was very friendly and accommodating.\nI would say it‚Äôs a great place for drinks with friends or on a date, although their Guinness tap might need a flush/servicing. The margarita I had was good, albeit a touch too sweet. The martini glass rim was half-salted, which is a touch I appreciate.\nI cannot in good conscience, recommend the food though. I tried the Australian Wagyu and although it wasn‚Äôt a disaster, it just didn‚Äôt seem like wagyu. Maybe a 1/4 breed at best. It was also a thin cut, served blue with a grey band and a mediocre sear. A decent steak from a coffee shop ‚Äúwestern food stall‚Äù but not at a $48++ price tag. Sorry, just ‚Äúkeeping it real‚Äù.",

The price is your standard SGD 25/ cocktail before tax which makes it all the more painful since there are plenty of great cocktail bars in the area.\nIf I return I'll have a beer or something that cannot be missed out.",
