Go through the gate, and find the stairs on the back to the left after entering the door. Go to the level B1 and youâ€™ll find the centre name written on the glass door on left.\nThe staff is very helpful and friendly.",

It mainly serves the more specialised tests, such as eye examination for license applications.\n\nFor some of the exams, it will be conducted at an external partner clinic. In such a case, they will arrange your time slot and you would just need to report to the partner clinic at the stipulated timing.",
