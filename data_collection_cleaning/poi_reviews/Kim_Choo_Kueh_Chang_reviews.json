Their salted egg yoke bz are good too, yoke is not too salty. The rice is soft, which means it is soaked well before cooking, and the ingredients are well marinated. The ratio of rice to ingredients is well balanced. For me it means less rice & more ingredients :).  I also bought some mini nyonya bz for my grandkids and they are just as tasty. The cashier is courteous & patient with customers trying to decide what to buy.",

Minus Star.\n\nDo note at second floor of the store is a small simple peranakan museum, visitors just enter the store and proceed level 2.",
