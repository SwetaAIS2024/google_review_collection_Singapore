Once you sit down they quickly touch brows and you canâ€™t get out. They will spend hours from one sale person to another to push you to do the most expensive. I pity those elderly thinking they had a good bargain during the atrium road  show. Unscrupulous tactics.",

I had this voucher from fave and the lady who attended me persisted to make a top up of $30 for a better lashes which is a cluster lash.. But low and behold, the lashes felt like those you buy from Daiso which feels so fake. It's like they cut it into pieces and glued it together with your lashes. And it damn hurts when I close my eyes! Never again! No wonder they don't allow reviews on their pages because of bad experiences from customers.",
