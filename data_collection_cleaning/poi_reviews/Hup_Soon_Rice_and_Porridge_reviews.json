When I discovered the stall still operating here, it felt like meeting an old friend. But is the old friend still the same?\n\nI remembered the food used to be a tad on the salty side, but this time it was less so. Perhaps my palate has changed with age. Anyway, good for health I suppose. Prices are still alright, and portions are definitely filling enough for most people.\n\nSo in short, this old friend hasn't changed much. Nothing is permanent though. I don't know how many more years they'll be here, but I'll certainly be making more trips here while I'm able.",

From my understanding, they are open for lunch and dinners on all weekdays. $10.50 for 6 dishes including porridge.",
