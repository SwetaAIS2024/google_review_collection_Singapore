Flo Yeow,4,"At just SGD 1.70, this fresh soya bean drink is a steal, especially given its exceptional quality.  It's rare to find such a distinct and delicious soya bean flavor, particularly in a drink format from a hawker centre stall.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
I am a Girl,3,"Was at this branch earlier today, 09 March at around 915am. Ordered 3 Ginko Beancurd ($3 each) and  soya milk($1.70). A lady attended to me. Once I placed order, I then told her no syrup when I see that she added syrup to soya milk. She smile smile tell me must tell her no syrup while pouring back /out the syrup. I smile smile replied that she never asked. So she still maintain her smile and say this must say in advance. But for beancurd she did take the initiative to ask me if I wanted syrup.  I am the person in maroon red in case they want to know who left this review (and there's also cctv camera) . Adding pictures of what I had ordered.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111706758732991650101/reviews
Juli Effendy,3,"Located at the hawker center, where by below the has traditional market. The soy bean dessert looks delicous but the taste is ordinary. I ordered a bowl with gingko, red bean and soy bean curd. The soy beancurd is not smooth enough. The gingko is over cooked and alittle bitter. A bowl cost sgd 4.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112179605402780535380/reviews

E W ‚ÄúE. S‚Äù S,1,"Dishonest. 26th Sunday (3 days before CNY), bought a cup of grass jelly soy bean milk. The price stated $2/-. After the item is ready, I handed $2. But the auntie said $2.30, cny surcharge. There is no signs / written notice of the surcharge. Furthermore, the auntie used the ice from the ice cooler which have prep cups filled with soy bean milk.
I will not visit again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114159138353090621274/reviews
