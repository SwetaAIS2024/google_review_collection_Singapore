Somehow very poor handphone signal inside, need to walk out to get some signal for phone payment modes.\n\nJap-Korean food generally ok. $6 for kimchi fried rice with an egg. Portion served quite a lot.\n\nDrinks stall choices of cocktail soda at $3.30 each, photo illustration looks concentrated with colour, actual is quite plain. Full cup of ice used for preparation, so pretty diluted. Staff is friendly and serves well, maybe the ratio of syrup guideline needs to be adjusted.",

      "text": "First time having my meal here. There are a total of 9 stalls here. All stalls are Halal.\n\nSituated by the waterfront, it is a very relaxing and cozy eatery at Northshore Plaza 2.\n\nYou can use your Kopitiam card here and pay lesser. Top-up counter available at the entrance.\n\nWe had nasi ayam taliwang and nasi Padang with Nutella and Oreo dough. Finish off with special blended coffee and tea with grass jelly.\n\nBoth foods taste delicious and fresh. We will come back again to try other stall vendors there.\n\nBelow are the stall vendors available:\n\n1. Lau Pa Sat BBQ\n2. Fitra Chicken Rice\n3. Enak Sedap Nasi Padang\n4. Astro Thai/Viet Cuisine\n5. Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang\n6. Indo Express\n7. Fat Baby Rotisserie      Western Cuisine\n8. Fat Baby Goes India\n9. D'Laksa\n\nThe only flaw, in my opinion, is that the tables and chairs are too close. Maybe they need to update the layout with only rectangular tables instead of round ones.\n\nUpdate: 15/07/2022\n\nToday we went again to try Fat Baby Western. We had Hawaian Pizza, Double Wagyu Beef Burger and Salmon Grilled Filet. The pizza and burger taste great while the salmon is a bit dry but still tasty. Overall this vendor is worth trying if you are feeling adventurous.\n\nUpdate 01/01/25: Try the Astro Thai stall today.Had the sweet and sour fish and Thai fried rice beef.\n\nTaste: Fair\nPrice: Moderate\nPortion: Not adequate\nVerdict: Not recommended",
