Eating satay with little sauce feels incomplete. Please don’t be stingy with the sauce, bro. Your satay sauce is really delicious, it just needs to be more if we want to enjoy it with the satay. Everything else was fine…",

Black pepper sauce packs a punch. Wish there's some veggie sides to cool down the heat. But still quite worth it with 2 pieces of lamb chop.",
