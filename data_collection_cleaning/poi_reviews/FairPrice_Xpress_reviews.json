The lady on duty (12.7.24 at 3.15pm) is unfriendly & appeared displeased when I wanted to pay for my purchases with a $50 dollar note. Not only she refused the business, she also continued to chat with her friend & ignored me. So I keep back the purchases to its rightful location & promised myself, not to go to this outlet anymore.",
