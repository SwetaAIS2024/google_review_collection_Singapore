Lee Jane,1,The shop staff is a scammer. She doesn’t provide Change for amount paid and claims that she cannot do that because her employer does not allow her to do so. She turned around to blame me for overpaying and started saying that I’m bullying an elder woman by asking for change.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102331187432275886951/reviews

Coco,1,"We didn't have a good service at this place , the staff (the elderly short haired woman) was not friendly and not interested in doing business  and the food is frozen chix and over priced of $7.80 for frozen food set. The drink is over priced for fresh juice compare with other stalls. The tea was too sweet even I asked for less sweet, tasted horrible.
Very disapointed, will never go back again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108940397591841285325/reviews

Paya Chinglish,3,"Intro: it used to be great value for money long ago, when it was a bigger stall, and there was a competing bubble tea takeaway stand (at where the current Subway restaurant is located) near it. it also used to be open earlier in the morning. now it feels more like it's competing with Subway and some of the more overpriced microwaved sandwiches at 7-11.

Food:
only ""cheap"" meal is the ""Student"" meal of cup noodless + a cup of iced soda syrup, which i have no interest in and i never see anyone ordering.

Fried Fish w/ Rice now cost about 8 SGD, which is more expensive than similar  ""famous"" western food stalls at Maxwell place and Old Airport Rd.

Burritos cost 5.80 SGD which looks too small but still cheaper than even more overpriced Subway Wraps. the Waffle Hotdog(or chicken) foldover cost the same and it's more filling, but waffles give me gas. the paper bags used  also tend to stick to the burritos, buns and fries which is very annoying.

===
Bubble Tea etc:

the actual bubble tea taste exactly like what you expect from a neighbourhood bubble tea shop, except escalating prices make them almost as pricey as ""brand name"" taiwanese bubble teas(and Gong cha-clone, Liho). imo the taste is similar to iTea choices of drinks. listed prices might be 50 cents more 'cause they couldn't be bothered to update the menu and signboards. IF you want large cups of bubble tea with more ""kick"", i strongly suggest buying Bubble Tea from Takagi Ramen instead.  the large cups here don't feel ""large"". the ice-blended drinks might feel more cost-effective as you can't slurp them up fast w/o getting brainfreeze. BUT if you really want brainfreeze,just buy Slurpee from the 7-11 next door.
===

Conclusion: really only worth it if you want hot food after the most of the coffeeshops are closed. it closes at 10PM, while most shops in the area close at 9PM. or you really wanna drink some bubble tea before walking to the beach or taking a public bus nearby. the prices of food/drinks at East Coast Park are even more jacked up these days.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112587492489000546116/reviews
