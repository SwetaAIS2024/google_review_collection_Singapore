Danielle Constantino,5,"I appreciate the quality of the food and the convenience of the location‚Äîespecially now that they've clearly improved their service since my last visit. The pizzas were fresh, and everything was ready on time. It's great to see consistent improvements, and this branch has definitely stepped up. A solid option if you're in the Chinatown area and craving something familiar and satisfying.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105253899776777262062/reviews
mie,5,"I visited Pizza Kreta Ayar earlier today and for some reason, this has become my go-to branch. I find the pizza here more delicious compared to other branches, there's just something about the flavor that tastes better, which I think reflects better quality. Service is also fast, and the waiting time is always reasonable and acceptable. The staff are quite friendly and accommodating, especially the manager on duty who made the visit even more pleasant. Keep it up, and maintain the good quality and the taste of the pizza !!!!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106312954271839202864/reviews
Anju Pillai,5,"I have been to many pizza hut outlet around here in sg but this one make me go into the google search the outlet & leave a feedback‚Ä¶.

I order $10.80 meal for 1 person which had a small personal pizza chicken wings & drumlets.
The taste of the pizza & chicken was beyond my imagination.. The pizza was so delicious cheesy got spices. Got perfect blend of chicken & toppings .
Generally when we order personal pizza from other outlet toppings & cheese all we need to search from micro scope as its budget friendly they totally vanish everything from it. But this outlet no words to say‚Ä¶ everything was so nice so perfect the ambiance the taste & specially the aura of the little girl who was making the pizza.‚Äù PAT‚Äù she was singing  inside the kitchen so lively so energetic so happy that her mood flows to pizza & makes it so amazing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
