KeanEng Chan,1,"Inaccurate bus timing, frequent delay or even no show sometimes.this happens every day. Sometimes, after waiting for 12 min.  we are still not sure whether the bus will show up. Truly disappointing there has been no
improvement even after so many months.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105726186652906417267/reviews
may kong,1,Unfriendly public place . The design like totally upside-down. 70% to 80% of passage at drop of points need to use overhead bridge to do change bus and this % need to share with the 50% or more ppl that come from the mrt. And 2 bus start point is out of interchange. If je going to be full develop this interchange won't able to hold the further crowd. The only star I give is new and clear.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108559659329043123990/reviews

David Loo,1,"I board bus 51 at teban garden heading Jurong East interchange,the moment I step in the driver immediately close the door without waiting for me to totally enter,as a result I was hit by the door on my hip.The most rediculous is the driver pretend never see anything at all,I was so flare-up so I told him I was hit by the door,he just simply say sorry without any sincerity as it it was nothing at all.we are passenger and using the public transport but was neglected n took for granted of our safety by the drivers,so sad to see such a scene in a civilized country like Singapore.(SBS3146U,I alight 16.15pm opposite j-cube)",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111425657683915231794/reviews
