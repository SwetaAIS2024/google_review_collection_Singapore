c k,4,"Great BBQ stick, flavorful and chewy lamb skewers. When the grill fish was served, I was very impressed with the presentation. A bigger than normal size and fish meat was firm but soup was a bit too sweet than normal. Maybe it is just a different style and not to my likeing. Will be back for more skewer meat. Service staffs was attentive and offered to change the plate that was full of fish bone.

Joy Lim,4,"Happened to passed by this not so new Chinese restaurant in Heartland Mall.

We are amazed by the options of grilled fish flavours but we choose the grills and skewers this time.

Skewers are well seasoned and the typical seasoning like cumin etc.
we like the grilled potato slice, beef and chicken gizzards.

The cold noodle is Superb with the sauce and chilli oil. Paired with shedded chicken and bean sprouts. My friend and I wanted the 2nd portions!
But too full!

French beans and shredded meat water bamboo shot taste very authentic and delicious.

Service crews have a few aunties and they are really nice and friendly. Attentiveness to each table, clearing the table promptly.

Definitely we will come back again, we don’t have to travel all the way to Chinatown. Environment is quite cosy, it’s not as noisy as Chinatown hahaha.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112272825302491064686/reviews
