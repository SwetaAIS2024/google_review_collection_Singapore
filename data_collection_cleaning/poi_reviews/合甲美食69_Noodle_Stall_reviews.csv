Li Yen -,3,"The only stall that I can find selling a bowl of noodles at $3.50 in this area. Decent amount for what I paid. If you want to eat mini wok, I think skip it, they gave me an odd way to enjoy mini wok in a takeaway bowl. ü§î",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107209361835014317044/reviews
ÈòøÂÆù,2,"Saw a long queue when I passed by this coffee shop so I thought maybe is worth the queue but after 30 mins and finally gotten our food, there was nothing but food & disappointment ü•π

The kolo noodle is normal & the fishball minced pork noodle is plain & normal‚Ä¶. The Â∞èÁ¢óÈù¢, they removed the small steamboat with fire & replaced with a paper bowl‚Ä¶. When we asked why no steamer pot all we got was ‚Äúnow new style‚Äù‚Ä¶ & the new style was just plain & boring.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
Chen Family,4,"Took the large ($4) Sarawak kolo mee, was asked whether I wanted chilli (??!). Yes, like other reviewers have commented, it's not really kolo mee Sarawak-style. The char siew was generous, but average in quality. The portion was large, for $4. I would say it's good value for money (5*), but taste-wise, slightly better than average. Not worth specially coming here for.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118145836301674418853/reviews
KiM BooN LeE,2,"Inside 1 of the 2 coffee shop that ""share"" the same walk way... Seem always have a Q but then realized really not sure why the Q.

Never again...",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104527916285751902034/reviews
Melvin J.,3,"Ordered the large Sarawak Kolo Mee for $4, personally I don't think it taste anywhere near to the original, I would say it taste more close to Johor style wanton mee (minus the soya sauce lol), slightly dry but nonetheless still a decent meal, giving them a 3 star because food is not as advertised.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110204106470894976302/reviews
