Their unbelievably low prices will surprise everyone. Their service - super quick and super friendly   - will make the queuing and raucous hordes of beer guzzling uncles bearable.\n\nYes. The environment of the coffee shop is, umm, PG21 on weekend evenings after 7pm.\n\nSupport these young men. They deserve their success.",

Everyone was given a device that would ping them when their order was ready but I was left standing in confusion.\nOn second account, he doesn’t even acknowledge me after taking my order l. After 10 mins of standing by the store trying to get my order in, I decided to just not bother. Don’t know what his deal is but could definitely tell he doesn’t want to take my order when everyone else’s order way keyed into the POS but not mine.",
