It has strong curriculum (including phonics) and all the teachers including staffs are awesome (so full of love). The principal (Ms Ariaya) holds her students' well being at high priority and the school has a much lower teacher-student ratio too. We are really grateful and thank all of you so much once again.",

      "text": "I am glad we chose Josiah @ Tampines as my boy’s first school.  Montessori learning was suitable for my boy as the lessons were based on his learning pace. The teachers were very proactive and very assuring, always gave me timely updates on his learning progress and advices on handling his rainy days. Even the teachers who didn’t teach his class updated me his progress. I could tell my boy enjoyed his classes as he would just showed me what he had learnt (like singing the Chinese song learnt that week). The non teaching team was very responsible and responsive to my enquiries.\n\nThanks for making learning fun for him! It was a great pleasure dealing with your team, and we still missed our Josiah days whenever we past by Tampines Mart.\n\nHighly recommend parents to consider Josiah for their preschool age kids. Your child totally will be in safe hands with Josiah Tampines.",

However, the teachers at Josiah Tampines had so much patience (even more than I, the parent, did) and never once raised their voices or portrayed any signs of exasperation. We saw such a vast improvement in him a mere 4 months later - he was finally talking, motor skills were finally taking off and we could now bring him out without any fear of meltdowns or social anxiety / meet relatives. He has also shown great social awareness in his willingness to greet or acknowledge people around him and takes responsibility for his actions. Thank you for the great start and for making Aydan's journey in preschool a great experience for him.",
