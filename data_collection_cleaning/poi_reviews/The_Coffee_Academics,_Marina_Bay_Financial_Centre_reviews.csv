Amanda Seah,1,"I wonder if it’s a blessing to have a supposedly well known coffee brand in a busy CBD location. It sure is IF the coffee tastes good and the quality is consistent.
Service in this particular TCA at MBFC has always been varied, some days the female barista would just pour the milk straight into the espresso like mixing water. Other days they might bother to do a proper cup of coffee for paying customers. 6.90 for a cup of dirty mocha and the two pictures I have here are worlds apart.
When I asked about the pale Milo-looking cup sitting on the counter, if that’s dirty mocha, she simply said “oh you want powder? Some ppl don’t want it” and she proceeded to dump powder into the cup. I stood appalled, to which she asked, “you want more?!” Wow. Just wow. I’ve ordered dirty mocha for the past 2 years, never, ever have I met this barista, just my day.

Kevin KW,4,"This coffee academics has been around for several years now, came back to try for the first time since covid. Slightly disappointed that a few of their coffees are no longer available (taped over in the menu board) and seems like there’s less pastries to choose from now.
But nonetheless coffee is still good , had the manuka which has some honey in it to give it a slightly sweet taste. The Okinawa is also nice from my memory having it a few years ago",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113538038005281311118/reviews
nathi Skin,4,"Delicious coffee, Very tasty coffee and nice staff.  The creative sense of the foam so the swan was very nice.  The design is also very modern and mainstream.  There are muffins to buy and different types of coffee.  You can also buy beans on site and a member card that offers many advantages.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107221411471263536971/reviews
L.G. Wee,3,"Jun 2019. This morning i was already intoxicated with caffeine. While walking past this new outlet after lunch, its aromatic roasted beans drew me in.

Lady Morpheus,1,Do you really have to jam packed the ice until the plastic cup ia deformed and can't even sit on the table without topping over? Is your lychee oolong tea so expensive that you have to fully load the ice till the brim that i can't even stuff a straw down the center? $8.10 for this sad cup of tea....,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100314224516003808214/reviews
