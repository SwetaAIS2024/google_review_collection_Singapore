Even when i added vegetables, she gave me a small dollop of it which I had to say it's too little. She eventually relented and added more vegetables for me. The pic is AFTER adding. You mean you expect customers to pay $1.50 for one teaspoon of veggie? Rice portion is for kids too. Disappointing.",

Auntie is very nice, she discounts for my elderly mother 3 dishes for $2.50. Do get to know the auntie and she will give you a lot more extra. Where to get $3 rice with 3 dishes? Really cheap.",

Besides being overly salty, the price points are not justifiable for the ingredients used.  Some soya selections are quite tasty (msg) and presented as mock sweet & sour pork etc but the salt level would probably give you a heart attack if you eat it daily.",

I dont order fried food coz they are oily and taste like stale oil.\n\nOtherwise all the braised and stir fried vegetables/tofu/pumpkin/eggplant are yummy.\n\nMorning shift aunty serving us is grouchy, u better know what ingredients u want while u queue.",
