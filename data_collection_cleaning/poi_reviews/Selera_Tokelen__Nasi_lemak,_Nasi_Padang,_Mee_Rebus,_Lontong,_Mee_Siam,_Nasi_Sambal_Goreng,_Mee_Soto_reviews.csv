faizal razali,5,"Uncle is very friendly, the Mee Soto is really good.. chili is spicy so ask for less chili if your not someone who can tahan spicy food.

The Epok Epok is the best! But only available early in the morning, by 11am expect it to be sold out.

Recommend to be there at 830-9am to get your hands on the Epok Epok",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101015130826442470404/reviews
