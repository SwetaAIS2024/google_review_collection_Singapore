      "text": "Surprisingly, it wasnâ€™t the steak that made the meal so memorable but rather the side dish and the dessert. Not that the steak wasnâ€™t good.\nI had their hanger steak, which had a decent crust and was a bit under done but was perfectly fine to me. Iâ€™d rather under than over. It was served with coarse salt and roasted garlic, which is more than you need with good beef.\nThe Brussels sprouts though, were outstanding! I think they were the best Iâ€™ve ever had, so far! Perfectly crispy and tossed in their sauce mix that balanced the bitterness superbly.\nThe tiramisu was quite a delight as well! Creamy yet airy, with a hint of bitterness that was mitigated by the drizzle of chocolate sauce. It was like an ebb and flow of gentle sweetness and bitterness throughout.\nShout out to the waitress for the recommendations! Her knowledge of the menu, passion and friendliness added to the whole experience!",

Good for a big eater\n\nAtmosphere wise had to get outdoor seats. Ongoing Reno and so not a fair call to comment.\n\nService staff were knowledgeable, helpful, attentive. Well done",

Service was great - not pushy, knowledgeable, brisk and polite. Ambiance leaned towards the casual side especially with the ongoing renovation in the mall but we had a good time. Will be back!",

If only all steaks were as well crusted. Will come back when Im feeling richer to try thatðŸ¤©",
