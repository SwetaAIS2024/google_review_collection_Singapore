Patricio Alegria,5,"One of myIf you're looking for a cozy spot that combines the best of local craft beer and smoky, grilled yakitori, this place is a must-visit. The vibe is laid-back with wooden accents and an open grill, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere.

The craft beer selection features a rotating list of local brews, with a standout citrusy IPA that pairs perfectly with grilled meats. As for the yakitori, each skewer is grilled to perfection, from juicy chicken to inventive veggie options. The tare sauce adds a rich umami, enhancing the natural flavors of the skewers.

Service is friendly and knowledgeable, overall, itâ€™s a great spot for craft beer lovers and yakitori fans alike, offering a satisfying and unique dining experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116835682781483686257/reviews

Earoel Kennedy,3,"The happy hour prices are still quite expensive - 2 small Japanese highballs for 16 which is the normal prices at Donki Bar.

The chicken karaage was over-fried and lacked flavor, and the skewer dishes were also overcooked, which was disappointing.

While the ambiance and service are pleasant, the food quality and pricing could definitely improve.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105782077382160797659/reviews
Sihan Goi,5,"Had dinner and drinks here with friends after work on a Friday evening. Ordered a bunch of izakaya food, including skewers of various types, gyoza, karaage, katsu, etc. I had the Beijing wheat beer which was not bad, but didn't like the orange wheat beer. Total came up to about $440+ for 10pax.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101606206460809087168/reviews
