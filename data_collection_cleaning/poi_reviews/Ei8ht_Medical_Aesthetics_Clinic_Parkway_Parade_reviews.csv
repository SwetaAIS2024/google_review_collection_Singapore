Linaish,1,"WHAT A DISCOURTEOUS CLINIC! My appointment was at 10am but when I reached there at 9:58am, no one there. At 10am, No one appears and clinic had no light on. Called clinic and customer center few times, no one picked up.
1020am, received a call from customer center and said will check with Marine Parade clinic.
Afterwords, received a message from customer center at 10:24am said wait for another 10min. At this point, no apology from the clinic nor their customer service.

Subsequently received a call again from customer service said go to the clinic and press the door bell. Also told me that they were there since 10am which is untruth.

Their customer service lack of sincerity and no unrepentant to be late. Unfortunately I did not receive their service so I can‚Äôt judge their treatment skills, but if you‚Äôre a on time person, don‚Äôt waste your time here.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115494367536043552268/reviews

Natalie Nguyen,5,"I came to 8 Medical Aesthetics clinic initially for simple acne treatment but was then convinced by the entire clinic: doctor Cheak and the clinic nurses for their attention, dedication and professionalism. Doctor treatment plan is very thorough and holistic and not at all pushing for high value procedures but to put my skin desired outcome 1st. Super happy with the results and i am now a frequent customer",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100488840663665127083/reviews
