Best station has got to be SCDF fire station. Bob n Charlotte was most enthusiastic and encouraging to the kids. Bob had massive loads of energy n made it so fun! Next best was the Paramedics. Kids enjoyed Shopee and Kiss92. They didnt want to leave the park. Awesome place for kids to learn about different occupations, earn money etc",
