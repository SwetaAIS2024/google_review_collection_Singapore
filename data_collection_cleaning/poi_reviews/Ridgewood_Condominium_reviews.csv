Yanzhen Bi,1,"share some bad experience from landlord of #07-03 61 Mount Sinai Drive, Ridgewood condo:
The unit has very old renovation with the original parquet floor from 1978. We rented the house for 4 years. One month after we moving out, I received a bill from landlord for repair work cost $4055 (including vanish living room and dining room area, repair parquet floor & skirting costs $1720!)
The landlord hold our deposit and did not tell what are the repair work to be done during 1st inspection and 2nd inspection.
If you are renting a unit from this condo, be careful of this landlord!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108452266092620149049/reviews
