Miss Ang,5,"Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for quality Japanese food with a cozy and welcoming atmosphere!

The sashimi was incredibly fresh. The dandan tofu sauce is homemade and unique, perfect for appetiser. For dessert, you must order the Earl Grey cheesecake!

The staff were also super friendly, attentive, and made us feel right at home.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102917556673096366848/reviews

Jeffrey C,3,"Monzen Izakaya is an ordinary neighbourhood Japanese restaurant offering a decent range of dishes. The decor is quite basic, and service is a tad slow. We find it a bit pricey for what it offers (overall experience). While the food is generally acceptable, it doesn’t particularly stand out.”",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106833163410885808643/reviews
