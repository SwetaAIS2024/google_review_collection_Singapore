While I applaud their efforts in organising a sports day for their students, this year it is on 24 august, there is no need to turn up the volume of your speakers to the maximum affecting homes in the neighborhood as far as 1 km away.  The whole neighborhood in siglap don't need to share your joy..thanks.",

Met us at the appointment time and thoroughly explained the admission process including the small details.\n\nCons >I felt the management utilizes funds on the sales and marketing department and is blinded towards the rest.\n\nThe facilities are run down, even though its an old school. That is not an excuse!\nThe money that is being earned through such a profitable school for the shareholders and investors, can be well spent on renovation and further improvement..... but NO!!\n\nThe security is not vigilant and lazy, there are live wires hanging without proper mounting or brackets.Â  There are rusted and broken drain covers, that is just waiting for an accident to happen. No proper lighting in the classrooms and the cleanliness is not up to the mark.\n\nTake a tour to get a good insight and proper justification of their asking fees!",
