Shaolin Leong,3,"Love their homemade noodle soup no.10 ! You have to try it ! Don't pack ! Consume there while it is hot ! Fantastic value at $4 /bowl including an egg !
Their minced meat ramen Shanghainese style is great too no.7 at $4.50/bowl ! One of my daughter's favorite! Lastly remember to order their dumplings (deep fried or boiled) too .
It is worth the trip ! Support our hawkers !
They sell frozen dumplings too ! Look at the queue  !",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116211953093285724040/reviews
L Chan,3,"Gan Lao Ramen $5.
Ramen was soggy & lumpy. Fried dumplings were soggy & chewy. Everything else is MSG overloaded.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116520472038541999281/reviews
C.H. Tan,5,"I've enjoyed their mee hoon kueh more than once. I find it tasty, affordable, and value for money. The mee hoon kueh also has a nice springy bite which I like.

It is one of the very few stalls that opens into the night at this food centre.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107606986562914647693/reviews

Stanis≈Çaw Saganowski,5,"They speciality is soups, but they have also dumplings, which are the best in the Empress Market. The sauce is amazing!

They cost 3sgd for 6 pieces.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114329673440621783215/reviews
