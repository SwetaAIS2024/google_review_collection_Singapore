Our family's art jamming session was led by the incredibly talented and patient Chen Laoshi and Liu Laoshi.\nTheir professionalism and guidance helped us bring our creativity to life. I was particularly grateful for their support in completing my \"Jesus Empty Tomb\" painting, which holds special meaning to me.\nThe gallery's warm and inspiring atmosphere made our experience truly unforgettable. We can't wait to come back and create more art together!\nThank you, 3u Art Gallery, Chen Laoshi, and Liu Laoshi, for a fantastic experience!",
