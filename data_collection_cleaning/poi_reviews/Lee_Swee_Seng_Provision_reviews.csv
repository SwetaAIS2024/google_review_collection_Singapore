Joe Ng,5,"This is a dying breed of retail known locally as a provision shop.  These used to be small department stores when they occupied more room selling everything from dried foodstuffs, household goods, appliances, and supplies.  These mom and pop operations have been slowly replaced by the larger chain stores.  Lee Swee Seng still carries all the dried goods, spices, sauces, and canned food that youâ€™ll need for Chinese cooking. Worth a visit just to see what a legacy provision shop looks like.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109434159714049459136/reviews
