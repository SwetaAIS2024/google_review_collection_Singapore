K Tan,4,"Had a super delicious char Siew rice lunch at Kay Lee roast meat.
Just $5.80 for one serving.
And the meat has caramel smokey flavor and rice portion is generous.
Meat cut could be more pleasing to the eye, but no complains.
Taste just as good from last visit more than 5 yrs ago.
Quality and taste is maintained.
Highly recommended.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105592887493237423833/reviews
R,1,"Standard has dropped so much. Ordered char siew rice. The char siew was so tough and dry. The chili sauce is the worst thing I've tasted in a long time. It's like a watered down version of bottled chili sauce, it's not even spicy and doesn't complement the char siew at all.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100928524923295735936/reviews
CP,4,"This is a place that I came to quite a few times over the years but it never quite wowed me until my most recent visit. This time, I was genuinely impressed by the quality of the roast meat, which was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The service staff was also much friendlier compared to previous visits making the meal very enjoyable.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
Darren Tan,2,Look good but the taste have dropped so much from my last visit. Char Siew is with charred bitter taste and the duck drumstick is just very ordinary and tasteless. not worth the money spent. Hope the owner will look into your food quality to improve,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106241955855026096175/reviews
Alford Chong (SomeGuy),5,"Even though went there past dinner hours, meats still maintained its tenderness and juiciness. Savoury glaze on the charsiew and the tender soya chicken just slips down so well. The Hong Kong style dry noodles were so springy and QQ that I ordered twice for myself.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112544484304600356903/reviews
