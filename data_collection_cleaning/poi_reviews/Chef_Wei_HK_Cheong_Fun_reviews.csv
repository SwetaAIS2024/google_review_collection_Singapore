珊珊,3,"Was excited to try the cheong fun. Ordered the one with dough stick. However i dont understand the need to have the dough stick cut into smaller pieces. Usually its the same size as the cheong fun outside.

Will be better if the dough is crispy and in one piece. Yam cake was decent.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106632263556167007031/reviews
Lisa T,3,Only the Chee Cheong fun is nice and on point in terms of flavour. Siew Mai and chicken feet were average.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101998729191684176802/reviews
Paul Toh,5,"Chef Wei is a new addition to Punggol in the famous food blogger new coffee shop.
Standard has been maintained and the Cheong funs are totally worth making the trip here.
All Cheong funs are made on the spot upon ordering and they have some flavors, such as the Cheong fun wrapped around fried dough which is hardly seen here but common in HK.
Highly recommended shop. Try the other dim sum dishes too, all very good and great value for money. No need to go waterway point any more.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110584107240453374/reviews
Choe Li,2,"Food is good. But the food order arrangements need to be improved.
The food delivery is priority. That's why the waiting time will take super long. Even there are two staff to prepare the foods. But they are like no communicate with each other. Some food are ready but some doesn't and this will make the waiting get longer.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109634315362333525197/reviews
