      "text": "One of our favourite coffee shops tucked in HDB in Jurong West near Pioneer North.\n\nThis coffee shop is always crowded and there are many options of food to choose from including mix rice, chicken rice, noodle soup, porridge, mee hoon kway, Indian stall that prepares variety of food including Roti Prata, Mee goreng, Briyani, et cetera; Chinese fruit and dried squid rojak, veggie Chinese vegetarian food, Japanese and Malay cuisine. Of course a coffee shop is incomplete without a beverage corner that also sells half boiled eggs and Kaya toast.\n\nThe three oldest stores I know are the Rojak, fishball ball noodles/curry noodles and chicken rice stalls.\n\nMy favourite store is the fishball noodles stall. Be fishball noodles, they also sell laksa, curry noodles, braised chicken feet, wanton noodles, noodles and more.\n\nMixed rice stall is also popular because of plenty of choices from variety of dishes.  The taste of their dishes quite tasty but I found the price is slightly higher, and the portion varies depending on the server.\n\nThe local coffee is quite good but the price is higher than in the city.\n\nOverall still a good neighbourhood coffee shop to visit especially when you do not know what to eat. You will find something there.",
