Roland,4,"Always enjoy the zhi cha version of vegetarian food from this stall. I think their pricing is reasonable with above average food quality.

The dishes I ordered today is meant for 4 male adult, and in quantity wise itâ€™s more than enough for all to have a filling lunch.

The curry fish head and vinegar pork trotter is also one of my regular dishes.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103766504321573171977/reviews
Esther Ong,4,"Very generous portion for the price.  I always think that vegetarian food is very expensive but this stall changed my mind. Food option is good - wide variety. The only thing ðŸ‘Ž food is very very very oily.
Minus 1 star for this.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101196033103412835566/reviews
Venny Juliana,5,"Nice vegetarian food in the quiet neighbourhood area. This stall is in a coffee shop in front of Dunman school.

The chili chicken rice very delicious, can smell the wokhey in the dishes.

The rice that they use also fluffy and soft.

I noticed that in store menu donâ€™t have creamy chicken rice and lemon chicken rice like shown in grab food menu.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114070569380434404874/reviews
