Gloria Poh,1,"Ordered kway chap set from the stall. The tou pok was so salty and the fatty meat was so tough that i couldn‚Äôt even swallow. Why would a duck rice stall not serve me duck meat but fatty meat that had been processed from the factory? I will definitely not visit this stall again, unless I want my teeth to fall off from chewing on the stone-like meat.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109172751281143077749/reviews
Darren Yow,5,"One of the best duck rice I‚Äôve tasted! The yam rice and sauce are the star of the duck rice dish, it‚Äôs arguably the most flavourful rice and sauce I‚Äôve ever tasted. ü§Ø Braised duck is of decent toughness, which I like. This deserves a 5/5 because it‚Äôs seriously so underrated in my opinion, I don‚Äôt understand why people aren‚Äôt promoting about this stall. Amidst all the duck rice stalls available in the West, this is one stall you should not miss if you love a superb sauce and yam rice in your meal üëçüèº",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115165411533391096140/reviews
ng samuel,1,"Purchased their bundle set for reunion lunch, consisting of braised duck, roasted chicken and braised meat. The braised duck was dry and hard. Roasted chicken and braised meat were dry. Thought of having the leftovers (without sauce) for a meal the next day but all had a sour smell. The meat (not even warm) was all in a bag when I arrived to collect. My first and last time purchasing from them. Cost me $75. Do reconsider before you place an order.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102811583584878137224/reviews
Repent less,1,"Everything including the soup was of terrible standard. Instead of the signature herbal taste, it's only msg and nothing else. So-called ""yam"" rice just ordinary rice in soya sauce. The meat was tough and tasteless. Totally cannot make it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110777493322629470188/reviews
