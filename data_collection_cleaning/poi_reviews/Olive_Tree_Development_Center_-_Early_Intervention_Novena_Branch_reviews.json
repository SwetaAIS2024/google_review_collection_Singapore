Felt most encouraged by the warmth of the teachers and therapists, which is much needed by kids with neurological development challenges Child now seeing good improvement after one term. Saw some of the negative reviews. Parents need to understand takes 2 hands to clap, your child development is a result of you and the centres efforts.",
