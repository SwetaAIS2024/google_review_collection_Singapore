Sam Toh (Sammy),5,"Like their concept, they offer more variety compared to Yoshinoya which was the top mind recall when you think of beef bowl. Sukiya's food is efficient and tasty. Ordered and the food arrived within five minutes. Affordable price and value for money.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110777175975209979259/reviews
jayden,5,"Had always love their suki beef bowls! Price is somewhat like in foodcourt prices which is pretty decent, beef is soft and tender, even a small or medium portion is enough to fill a meal.
Quality of food standard has always been consistent too.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
Vanqz,2,"Horrible staff work ethic.
Tables are left uncleared, staff aware of it but deliberately avoided cleaning up. Instead choosing to clear only 1 of the 3 trays left there for some reason. The remaining trays were left for 20mins until a customer approached them to have it removed.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109502973306849886603/reviews
Chewy,1,"Food taste better than the other outlets but they are of fruitflies and houseflies hovering around while I eat. Turn off for me. Have to swap the flies every 1min

To add on, while your food is already prepared and to serve, the flies probably would have taste of it first before you during peak hours.

Hopefully management will do something to control the flies.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115999463574400655077/reviews
Lawrence Wee,4,"You have to order food by scanning the QR  code and making payment for your order online.

Tea is served as you are sitted.
This is my second visit.

During my first visit, I ordered a small gyudon for less than $5, of which I was a bit surprised. So you could have a meal with free tea here for less than $5 here (gst inclusive)

On this visit, we ordered a unagi don, curry rice set with chicken karaage, and a low-carb gyudon (rice replaced by tofu) for $30.30.

The unagi don was a bit dry, and I would suggest ordering it with half boiled egg.

The curry rice was a little bit spicy for us but  helped to lift the appetite.

The low-carb gyudon is good for the health conscious and tasted alright.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106780661952254628889/reviews
