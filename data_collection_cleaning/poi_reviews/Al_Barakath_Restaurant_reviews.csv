Barakath Ali,5,"I always had the pleasure of dining at Barakath restaurant, and I must say, it was an extraordinary gastronomic experience that left me in awe. The captivating aroma of Indian spices filled the air, tantalizing my senses and building anticipation for the culinary delights to come.

The attentive staff members were knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent recommendations, ensuring that every aspect of my dining experience was exceptional as always.

I couldn't resist trying the Chicken Biryani & Chicken Mee Goreng. The tender chicken pieces melted in my mouth, leaving me craving for more. Each spoonful was a delightful explosion of flavors.

Barakath restaurant is truly a gem, I highly recommend visiting Barakath Restaurant.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110521615615997518252/reviews
Gerard James Rozario,2,"My friend used to frequent this place 1-2years ago, since he stay nearby. So he wanted me to try it out.

Nasi Goreng Pattaya was really bland, had no taste at all. They gave us a bottle of chilli, but the chilli wasn't spicy at all.

Teh Tarik so so only.

Saving grace was the omelette, at just $2, for the price, it's good. Service was good as well, that is why I gave two stars.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104331903494874729587/reviews
