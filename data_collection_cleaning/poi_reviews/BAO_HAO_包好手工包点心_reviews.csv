early chuah,4,"I feel sad now cos this stall sells such yummy baos but they are so far away from me!!! The juicy big Pau, the not so oily Kong ba pau are so 😋. Can eat a lot without guilt 😅 love the steam pork too. Too bad they don’t have the Hong Kong style steam rice with this same meat. If have sure good 👍🏻 and my favourite is definitely the lotus leaf rice❤️. This no fight! 😬 The only thing not so nice is the location cos situated in the west😅",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111463378542177022743/reviews

Maggie Ng,5,"The food is really good, and the price is very reasonable. I heard that the gong bak bao is very good but it was sold out when I reached there. Will make a trip there again to try it.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107843295367101542575/reviews
