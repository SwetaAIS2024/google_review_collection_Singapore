Jas Wong,5,"Wonderful experience!
The clinic assistants, Samantha & Sarah went above and beyond.
Despite my lateness, they handled everything smoothly and ensured my scan was completed without delay.
They also made sure I felt comfortable and at ease throughout the entire process.  Their friendly demeanor and helpful attitude made a significant difference.
A great experience overall!
Thank you!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109020186582905563368/reviews
daniel lim,5,"I have been patronising Bethesda Medical @ Suntec for my medical requirements for many years and exclusively since they moved into their current 3rd floor premises at the north atrium. Samantha and her staff nurse team at reception have always attended to my registrations and other requests expeditiously and without delay, so as to ensure that all my visits were as pleasant and smooth-sailing as possible. Dr. Tina and her team of medical practitioners have also demonstrated thoroughness in their investigations as well as provided sound medical advice and treatment plans for whatever health ailments that plagued me. All in all, i am grateful to the entire medical team at Bethesda Medical @ Suntec for their many years of taking care of my requirements, and I wish all of them well.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111871595880890311127/reviews
