Happy Bird,3,"$9.20 for a 12oz flat white! These prices are just getting out of hand. Feel like we're being robbed each time we get a coffee from this or any cafe in the airport for that matter. Will likely be the last time, can't continue like this. It's no wonder tourists are avoiding visiting Singapore. Who wouldn't avoid a country where a 12oz cup of coffee costs close to $10 or where a sandwich costs $16.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108716533290322327726/reviews
Mei Chin,3,"Had the iced chocolate, there were noticeable sugar granules in the drink, likely from it not being fully mixed. The berry muffin was tasty, though a bit small. Prices are slightly higher than other nearby cafés.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100576557181748661925/reviews
Cassia A,4,"Honestly good just overpriced. The chicken toasty with avocado and spinach was tasty and the bread was really fresh ($15). The coffee is quite good ($5.40 for an Americano) and cheaper than Starbucks or Coffee Bean.
They have healthy options and breakfast options like salad, chia pudding, etc. it’s just expensive.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117662481746295955146/reviews
Kimberley Howarth,4,"Its okay, just long queues. I was here at 7am so maybe lots of people trying to get breakfast. It is expensive tho, around $16 for a very simple sandwich. Maybe airport price...",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957590885643931784/reviews
John Kong,1,"Poor service and slow. Ordered an Americano and Latte, server was not paying attention and slow, serve these coffees to people at the back of the paying queue. For the prices I paid, I expect better service attention. Last time I will goto a Pert a Manger, you will be better of at the Hudson coffee next door or find a Starbucks",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105265903334273315635/reviews
