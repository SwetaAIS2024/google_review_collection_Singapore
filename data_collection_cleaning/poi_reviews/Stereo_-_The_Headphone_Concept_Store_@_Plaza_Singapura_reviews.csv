Sanka Hettiarachchi,5,"The best shopping experience I had when buying a pair of new headphones üéß‚ù§Ô∏èü§©!!! I had done some background research and had three models in mind. I explained this to Cyrus at the store and he was super helpful and understanding of my requirements. Not only did he let me try all three models to compare, he also explained the reasons why his customers chose each model before. He also let me try some of the top of the range models too to compare and see what audiophiles were paying top-dollar for ü§ëüéµ‚ù§Ô∏è. Highly recommend the store for having experienced and expert music lovers to serve their customers and carrying a wide selection of products to choose from and compare all at the store. Really brought back the in-store shopping experience I was missing a lot ü§©üëçüëçüëç wish them the very best!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112009533965102532541/reviews
Ruyin Goh,5,"Great service! The staff who helped me patiently let me try and recommended different models for my small ears. I managed to find an in-ear monitor within my budget that fit me and whose sound I was very happy with. The ambience of the store is also nice and quiet, with a lot of seating area to try the demo units.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118089925523316498216/reviews
Kris Aw,5,"The staff were extremely kind and helpful, and were willing to let me test up to 3 different models before I eventually landed on the FiiO FT1 Pro.

Would definitely come back when I am ready to purchase a DAC",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117745389347989306712/reviews
