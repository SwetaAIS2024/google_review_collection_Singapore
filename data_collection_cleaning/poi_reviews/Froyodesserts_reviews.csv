Clarice,5,"The food is super nice! I tried curry karage, korean spicy noodle and shishamo. Super good! The korean spicy noodle surprise me! I like chocolate and durian ice cream also!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113016226688449370747/reviews
Eugene Chan,4,"Edit on 9 Jan 2025 : Returned to order 3 dishes and 1 drink.
• Teriyaki Chicken don : Unfortunately the Onsen egg was clearly overcooked and was still served. (Lack consistency or just disregard for it hence -1⭐) Chicken , rice and sauce was still good.
• Salon Mentaiko don : salmon was dry after cooking. Might need wet brining or a mix of cooking method to maintain moisture within the meat.
• Chicken Karaage curry don : 4/5 was ok. As expected.
• Mango yoghurt smoothie : 5/5 appreciate the use of fresh mangoes. Will definitely purchase again.

Didn't know the photo was blurry but wanted to leave a positive review.

Teriyaki chicken don : Onsen egg was perfectly cooked and adds great texture to the rice. Rice was great and had adequate sauce. Chicken was well grilled. 5/5

Salmon mentaiko don : Salmon was nicely cooked. Slight crisp that adds great mouthfeel. Mentaiko wasn't too overpowering. Would like to have a tad bit more sauce/gravy on the rice. 4/5

Miso Soup : Light and well balanced. Wish it wasn't half filled.

Chilli : Quite a weird pairing with the dish but as a standalone it's good.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100912580959459936332/reviews
J,5,"Bought the cereal chicken curry rice! Waited 10-15 mins while they cooked it on the spot! Thus everything was really hot. $7 plus takeaway. Chicken pieces tasted fresh, no weird smell and it’s all huge chucks~ rice was well cooked! Curry is not spicy at all, carrot and potatoes were cut into perfect sizes (not those small small pcs) generous Amt given :)",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108836346505805335103/reviews
Emily Ho,5,"The waffle and gelato were so good! Esp the earl grey!!! The banana choc gelato tasted exactly like eating a banana. Pistachio gelato was sweet, which matches very well with the earl grey gelato. The rice bowls had a lot of ingredients and it's definitely filling. The meat didn't have the frozen taste too, and were well marinated. Passionfruit yakult drink was refreshing and not too sweet. This is my to-go place for rice bowls and gelato/waffles now!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106638367480970822498/reviews
Shu Zhe Ng,5,"Visited this shop in the morning and it was not crowded at all. Food taste pretty good with very short waiting time. Honestly, the curry is pretty healthy, not too salty and not too heavy, fits my preference just nice! Awesome choice for those who prefer lighter taste. Matcha Yoghurt is pretty decent as well, will come back for more!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107333158713312587720/reviews
