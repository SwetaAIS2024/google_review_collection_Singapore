lontongstroong,4,"Very nice brunch and coffee place. In all of my visits, the service goes above and beyond - attentive without being intrusive. The meals are tasty and made with utmost care, while not being too expensive for the full meal. The shakshuka was an explosion in the palate and nourishing, served with some garlic bread (wish they have a choice of flat bread instead, but this is just a very minor complaint!). The kaya toast was a delight and served fresh albeit the portion was a bit too small. The briny, garlicky, clam soup was also very fresh (the clam was not smelly and still springy) and properly garnished - not too thick that it still allows the natural taste of the sea to shine. Check their coffee out too, especially the silky smooth cold brew. Surprised to see it served with a whiskey glass (and proper ice rock too!).

The place has a very nice airy patio. I can see why many local dog owners frequent this place. They sell *dog* ice cream as well!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
J Koh,5,"A lovely lunch experience with my family and puppy.

Ordered the breakfast set (huge, enough for 3 paxs actually) for 2 and a tempura kale pasta (which was delicious!)

Staff was attentive, my pup got a cookie! Would be great if they offered water for my pup too...",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103331239252894299165/reviews
yamuna mohanram,5,"A small pet friendly cafe hidden in a quiet neighborhood. Do check W39 on the west coast road, behind Clementi stadium. Their food tastes absolutely delicious. I tried their soup of the day, crab meat cakes, chicken burger as a meal that comes with a drink, hummus with bread and lastly ice cream. this set all put together was 28 dollars. The portion size is quite big enough too. Of all the food, we tried what  I loved the most was the soup and fries. Soup was smooth and creamy, it perfectly paired with the sourdough bread and the fries that came as a side for the burger, I honestly can tell you this is the best fries I've had. Chicken burger and crab meat cakes were really good too. Compared to these, I was less impressed with the flavors from hummus but my husband enjoyed it thoroughly. Their bakes are absolutely yum too, I've had them in the past. For  food I would rate this place very high for flavors, presentation and the portion size.

The staff also need a big shout out, these guys are doing an amazing job. they are friendly and chill. You guys haven't come to visit them.

it's 9/10 from me.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102396677643961543131/reviews
Eugene Wang,5,"Very lovely cafe parked in a landed housing area. Food is great, atmosphere is great and an overall nice area to come to study. Was my second time here and did not disappoint.

Rita Chan,1,"The food is normal. We ordered a pasta and lasi namak. The sauce of the pasta is too watery.

I am a bit concerned about their hygiene. This is the lid of the water bottle… it’s very dirty and seems they never wash it….",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115285054268935371331/reviews
