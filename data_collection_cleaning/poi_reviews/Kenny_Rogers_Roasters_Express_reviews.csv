Chin Xuan Tan,5,"Ordered Cajun Fries, it taste very good. The fries are crispy and delicious.

The shop closes on 930pm and we get 2 free muffins each person with my friend.

The staffs are friendly and will recommend to dine here.

It is not crowded at all.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108863256906173258837/reviews
M *,4,"It’s quite a good value for quarter chicken and sides. Good thing is we can select breast piece or thigh meat. The chicken with the sauce is good, and chicken well cooked. The chicken with rice, flavouring maybe not as nice , because lack of sauce. Overall good options for lunch. Corn muffin is nice which is included",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103330821176864508073/reviews
Patrick Sia,1,"I ordered quarter chicken and was asked for additional $1 because they only have thigh part left - during lunch hours. I asked the guy why and what’s the difference. He said the thigh part is bigger. I felt scammed, Kenny Rogers shouldn’t charge the customers extra $1 for a “big” part of chicken. Look at their “big” thigh part chicken portion.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108785392785155524904/reviews

Simon Tay,1,"Order 3 quarter meal and side give wrong for takeaway. The person taking order is slow and still can key in 1 wrong side and than pack another wrong side. Order potato salad give mash potato.
