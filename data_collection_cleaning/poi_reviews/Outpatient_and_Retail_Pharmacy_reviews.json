Somehow after I enquired, my Q# was called minutes later. Go figure. When I want to pay online, they said I need to pay up before I leave the pharmacy. Previously, I do not have issue when I opt to pay online when visiting specialist.\n\nThat sums up the efficiency of a Singapore public hospital and the trust that placed on patient !!",

Patient should be able to get their medicine upon checking from Doctor consultation and no more registration required. It is a waste of time and also tiring for an elderly patient who have to wait and sit on their wheelchair unable to have proper rest. Wasted almost 10 min registering and waited more than an hour and no is still not called.",
