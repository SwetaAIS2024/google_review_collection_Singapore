      "text": "Dairy Farm Nature Park is a peaceful retreat on the edge of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, offering a mix of easy trails, educational features, and scenic nature spots. Once part of Singapore‚Äôs early dairy farming heritage, it‚Äôs now a popular spot for nature lovers looking for a quiet escape.\n\nOne of the highlights is the pleasant walk from Car Park B to Singapore Quarry ‚Äî a gentle 2km route through lush greenery that ends with a tranquil view of the former quarry, now a calm wetland with a sheltered deck. I‚Äôd rate the park a 5 out of 5 ‚Äî serene, scenic, accessible, and a great way to enjoy nature just minutes from the city.",

Those areas are not covered, so if you the 11am-afternoon sun hits you, it can be very bright and hot. You will need a cap.\n\nYou will see monkeys, monitor lizards and at some point snakes and wild bore. Pls ensure you know what to do and not provoke them. (There are signs around for you to read)\n\nIt‚Äôs a lovely 5-6km walk.",
