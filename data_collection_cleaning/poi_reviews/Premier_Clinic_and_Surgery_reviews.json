End up charged 58 dollars\nWhereas Keystone Clinic quoted me 45 dollars. Previously I am using DA clinics which is cheaper but it's further away I dun have the time to bring her so I ask her to visit Keystone but end up getting con here. Can't blame her as well cos this clinic in deed look more run down and more down to earth compare to the modern looking Keystone Clinic.",

Are we STILL in 2019?\n\nThe nurses were unprofessional without any compassion. Brushed me off and said bring your covid to other clinics for them to treat u.\n\nWHAT kind of sickness could warrant a visit to this doctor?\n\nIt seems to me this clinic is choosy about its patients. According to reviews U cannot come late even if u are desperate.\nNEVER visit this doctor is the best advise I could give to anyone. Absolutely horrendous.",
