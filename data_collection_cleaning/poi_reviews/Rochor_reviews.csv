Flo Yeow,4,"It's pretty straightforward, if you're studying or working in the area. If you're looking to shop for electronics, you'd likely need to pass through this MRT station, as it brings you directly to Sim Lim Square. The station is relatively elderly-friendly too, as there's Bencoolen Street nearby.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews

Genta,5,"Rochor MRT station, located in the vibrant Bugis district, offers convenient access to some of Singapore's most popular attractions and neighborhoods. As I navigated through the station's sleek and modern interiors, I appreciated the ease of travel afforded by its strategic location and efficient layout. The station's close proximity to iconic landmarks such as Bugis Street and Haji Lane made it a convenient starting point for exploring the eclectic mix of shops, restaurants, and cultural sights in the area. One notable feature of Rochor MRT station is its accessibility, with elevator access available at select exits to accommodate passengers with mobility needs. Whether embarking on a shopping spree, sampling local delicacies, or immersing oneself in the vibrant street art scene, Rochor MRT station serves as a gateway to the diverse and dynamic neighborhoods of Bugis and beyond.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117016178934992842533/reviews
