We were so worried that our child will give more problem when he attend school as he doesn't listen or sit. By the 3rd month our son can say ABC and now he is counting. He  can sit for a proper meal and eager to go to school everyday. He love his teacher Ms.Eshitha. We've made the correct choice of sending him to kidsmonte. All the teachers, principal and even the aunty in the school was so welcoming and we can see that they put in hearts in helping all the children there. Thank you so much!",

      "text": "My son was diagnosed with moderate autism in 2022. During that time, he changed kindergartens twice, but neither experience yielded satisfactory results. Eventually, we found Kidzmonte. After having a conversation with the principal, Ms. Pechi, I felt a great sense of confidence and hope. We decided to transfer our son to Kidzmonte.\n\nOver nearly two years, I have witnessed tremendous changes in him. Previously, he hardly spoke at all; now, he enjoys talking. He used to be very afraid of strangers, but now he can greet neighbors proactively when he sees them in the elevator. His self-care skills have also improved significantly.\n\nI feel truly fortunate that my son and I found Kidzmonte, along with Ms. Pechi, Teacher Meera, Teacher Radha, and all the other kind and dedicated teachers. Originally, my son was scheduled to start Primary 1 in 2025, but I have decided to let him spend another year at Kidzmonte. I believe that with one more year of learning and growth, he will be ready to transition smoothly into Primary 1.",
