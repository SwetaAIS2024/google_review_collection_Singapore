Adrian Chan,5,"Very good fish and chips. Compared to some fish and chips, this is not greasy to the point that you will want to stop eating after a few bites. The wedges were also nicely seasoned. There is also different selection of fishes. The place is rather small with only a few tall table and stool. Staff was also very friendly as well. Definitely recommended.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109957919811943890317/reviews
Jia En Teo,5,"Best fish & chips spot in Singapore, some say JB too. We love the Fish & Wedges in seafood flavour. It comes in an easy to go package that you can put on top of ice tea for you to continue to shop while you eat!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106038091723281092765/reviews
Rong Yi Lim,5,"Absolutely spot on Fish & Chips. Food is freshly battered and fried upon ordering, the batter is not too thick, light and very crunchy. Fish is so fresh and flaky, love the wedges as well; perfectly seasoned and just delicious all around.

There’s a promo now where if you get a set meal with drink, you will get a complimentary coleslaw.

Ice tea is on point too as a refreshing beverage after all that fried goodness. Highly recommended!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114910781687259730898/reviews
S. K.,5,"Had the fish and chips here several times and it has never disappointed. The fish is cooked perfectly and the batter is great - tasty, crispy and not too much/too little. The portion also fills me quite well. Tilapia is nicer than dory. Love the cup & bowl packaging - very cute and convenient! The staff are also very friendly and helpful. I like to eat this for lunch (they're very popular so it is a bit of a wait but it's worth it to me!)",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103411090377474571154/reviews
Galaxy C,5,"Will be back soon for more fish and chips

Chanced upon this food take way store and had the pleasure of trying the fish and chips at OPG Ocean Playground, and I must say it was an incredibly tasty experience. From the moment I walked in, the inviting aroma of freshly fried fish greeted me, instantly whetting my appetite.

The fish itself was cooked to perfection – crispy on the outside, while still maintaining a moist and flaky texture inside. The batter was light and flavorful, providing the ideal balance of crunch and tenderness. It was evident that great care was taken in ensuring the fish was cooked just right.

The accompanying chips were equally delightful. They were thick-cut, golden brown wedges, and had a satisfying crispiness that made them simply irresistible.
The seaweed flavour wedges are the best: Each bite was an explosion of flavor, leaving me wanting more with every mouthful.

The staff members were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. They made me feel welcome and were happy to accommodate any special requests or dietary preferences.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110105298525199957697/reviews
