Rach C.,5,"Kenneth is an experienced, easy going and dedicated coach. He constantly corrects students to make sure my kids plays tennis the right way while making sure that they still have fun. More importantly, he has a great passion for the sport and he always wants what's best for his students, giving extra time when he's able to or helping them in other ways outside the tennis court!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102344884301932549278/reviews
John Graham,5,"I have been training with Swing Tennis for over a year having picked up tennis again after 20 years. Kenneth, the coach, works systematically and patiently on your game starting with basic ground strokes, serve, volley and slice. He focuses on getting form and structure correct, and then on movement and footwork to build a strong consistent foundation that will serve anyone at any level.
He adapts his program to fit your needs and fitness level, whether you are a social player or aspire to play competitively.
The big advantage of  working with Swing Tennis is that it provides opportunities to play with other players of a similar level at group sessions, including even in-house or inter-club tournaments to hone your skills and enjoy the game in a non-threatening friendly environment.

Highly recommend Swing Tennis for players of all levels and ages. Super fun crowd!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113242058415694585308/reviews
Keith Ang,5,"Kenneth is a dedicated coach who takes the time to work on your techniques and overall game play. Unlike most other coaches who just feed balls during training sessions, Kenneth focuses on useful drills to help improve your overall gameplay. He also organises friendly tournaments and finds match opportunities for his students to give them something to work towards and to practice things that heâ€™s taught. Iâ€™ve improved so much since working with Kenneth! Would recommend him to anyone whoâ€™s serious about improving their tennis gameðŸ’¯",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110034706535346399786/reviews
PAVAN RAJPUT,5,"Iâ€™ve been training with Kenneth for more than a year and can easily say that itâ€™s been a fabulous experience from the 1st session we did. Kenneth, being himself trained in the sport the right way and having rubbed shoulders with the best in the country, emphasizes on building strong fundamentals. My learning curve has been shortened ever since I started training with him - but thatâ€™s not all, Kennethâ€™s takes a 360-degree approach to tennis training and helps me train my mental and physical self as well. Goes to show how much he invests in his studentâ€™s journey. Donâ€™t think I couldâ€™ve asked for a better coach - things are only looking better here on. Thanks Kenneth!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108120049718607009007/reviews
Kate Park,5,"Kenneth is the best coach I've ever had! Very experienced and attentive coaching style! Every time I make a mistake, he always gives me feedback and tries to make me fully understand so that I can correct myself. Highly recommend people who want to play the REAL tennis and get clear and precise feedback from the coach!!!! ðŸŽ¾",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114074556170760817071/reviews
