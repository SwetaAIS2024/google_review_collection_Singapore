It was a pleasant surprise to see this small shop decked out with Marvel Legends, Star Wars The Black Series, and some not so common items you would see in retail stores. Prices were reasonable too.\n\nAdditionally, they were really passionate  about toys and collecting them.\n\nI highly recommend visiting them and would definitely come again.\n\nTo note, they accept Paynow/Cash only.",
