El Alv,3,"Noodles are acceptable, but too sour for the tomato paste version.

Soup were ok, lots of cooked blood.

Liver and meat were ok.

A T,5,"Always love their soup and noodles especially mee sua. When I first tried maybe last year I think, I was so surprised the soup was so thick with the meat broth, lots of meat, garlic pieces and coriander. There are bits of ikan bilis. The soup tasted superbly good. We finished all every time!  The dried Mee Sua  was also delicious and I always ordered dried Mee Sua.  Somehow dabao I felt the soup is lesser maybe box smaller. So I prefer to dine in. Moreover here is 24 hours and  we kept coming back üòÖ. yes tonight we are having it again, I am nursing a sore throat so I opted for Mee Sua Soup, just as good.  Yummy.  There is still queue now at 11pm‚Ä¶. üëçüëçüëç",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110290698573319690288/reviews
No nickname,5,It might look simple but it‚Äôs actually not your average noodle as the noodles are mixed and coated well with the chilli mixture which had a hint of pork lard oil as well. The plus point is that the noodles are cooked perfectly as it retains a certain chew at every bite. The set comes with a bowl of meatballs with minced meat soup in which the minced is given a quick blanch before it is added to the savoury broth. The star of the bowl has got to be their meatballs as each had a certain bounce and texture to it.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115975825494422026456/reviews
wu xiuhui,2,"Ordered 2pkt fishball noodle soup. One of the soup amt they give was so pathetic. Only 1/3 of the container. After put in noodle, cant even see the soup.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101934716953541810326/reviews
Francesca Tan,4,Generally the taste and texture is good. But the signboard is misleading. Fishball soup on the board shows 7 fishballs for the price of $5.90 but I received only 5 fishballs. A bit disappointed.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101739623247310618687/reviews
