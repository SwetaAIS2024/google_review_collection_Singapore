The compact clinic also charges 1 of the cheapest prices for doing up an LPA and is listed on the OPGO website.\n\nMy visit on a weekday afternoon saw no queues, and the whole process took about 20 minutes, including a short wait and consultation.",

The doctor here, Dr Hisham (who is also the owner of the clinic) cares a lot about his patient and will take his time to listen carefully to the patient's concern, then will advise accordingly. He is very empathetic, kind and knowledgeable. Would really recommend Bartley Clinic to anyone!",

Dr Hisham attended to my concerns and provided great explanation. They also do longevity and preventive medicine which I want to know more about and is a Healthier SG clinic. Surprisinly their health screening packages are quite affordable and comprehensive. Great to have a fantastic clinic and Dr around.",
