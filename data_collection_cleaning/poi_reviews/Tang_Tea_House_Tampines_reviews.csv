ixmog,1,Steam chicken rice is not nice. Chicken meat not smooth. Rice too rough. Black sauce too sweet and watery. Chilli although spicy but watery. Cendol taste alright but the red bean inside is sour and rancid ! I will not patronise again ðŸ¤® OMG I had diarrhoea after that and on medication ðŸ’Š,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100812493399714187433/reviews
Mel CC,2,"Bought Beef brisket fried rice and wet beehoon for lunch â€¦ take away.

Black pepper BEEF BRISKET Fried rice ($8.40) tastes ok but NO BEEF BRISKET MEAT at all. So I had a beef brisket fried rice that only has fried egg on top.   1 STAR. So Disappointed

Tiga Rasa Beehon ($7,70): taste ok but soooo spicy. All I can taste is the chilli like wet sauce.  2 stars.picture attached

Sadlyâ€¦ maybe Iâ€™ll try other dishes but for those 2 items I bought, I will never buy them again.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100520646509626189722/reviews
Andrew Ang,3,"Had the roasted chicken rice, which was decent and nicely served boneless for easy eating. However, the service was lackingâ€”waited over 30 minutes for the food. Could be better with improved efficiency.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107102294621091457763/reviews
