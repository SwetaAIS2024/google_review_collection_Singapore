Amy Lim,1,"If there is a choice, I think I will not even rate them a star. The counter service was really slow. We have to spend 2 hours plus to get through an application.

First of all, the forms found online are not readily available at the counter and we have to access the website from our phones to fill up the forms and email the branch so that they can print it out for our acknowledgement. Super inconvenient. Unlike other banks where there are iPads around for customer's convenience.

Secondly the staff at the counter is the least helpful. She stared at us while we struggled filling up the forms in our phone. When asked, she will reluctantly advise the steps while looking at her own screen without even looking up.

It took us quite a while to do it. When we finally completed the forms and left, someone from the branch called much later to inform us that we need to go back again the next day as the signature is not similar to what's in the system.

From the inefficiency to attitude and lack of interest in serving our request, I definitely will not want to go back to the branch again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102737592999492960618/reviews

Sarhan,5,"Visited the branch on a Monday (20ᵗʰ January 2025 @ 4pm). Had a bit of queue but we used the sms queue function & went for dinner while waiting. Total waiting time was around 90mins probably because CNY is coming.

The teller Kong Pui Yee was friendly & efficient in doing her job.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108318036935971279843/reviews
Allan Tang,1,"Told the queue lady at the entrance on my home mortgage application, obtained a number and waited for 1 hours plus, then counter told me this belonged to the sales team at the corner tables. Have to re-queue again. Super terrible service rendered.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107159381396821349605/reviews
Vikas,1,"There is usually a delay here. Better visit during early morning hours.

There are chances that you may run into a staff member which is not at his best. This might be due to the sheer volume of customers they have to serve.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101905033524146898852/reviews
