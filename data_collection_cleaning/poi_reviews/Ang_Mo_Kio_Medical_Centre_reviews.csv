Ada Wong,1,"Arrived clinic at around 10am, standing in front of the receptionist to wait for registration and the staffs were just rude, ignoring me, just let me stand there for a few minutes. The clinic closed at 1230pm, but until 1215pm I still not managed to see the doctor. I have waited for two hours. During registration the staffs had never told me that I have to wait for such a long time because I saw inside the clinic there were less than ten patients, shouldn’t be that long probably? If expected there will be a long wait time, you should inform the patients. The patients were already feeling uncomfortable waiting for treatment and medicine, still need to wait for more than two hours which is ridiculous. Will never visit anymore.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105396324917848065517/reviews
Claudia xuan,2,"Came at 1055am and somehow Doctor is out for break when lunch closing should be 1231pm-229pm. Receptionist did a slow registration and did not inform me of the Doctor's break time.

Waited 25mins to see queue not moving (3pax infront of me) and Doctor holding 2 kopi(s) for the receptionist.

Honestly Doctor service was good, but the receptionist is otherwise...",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102342605769118777419/reviews
Suz Khal,5,"A nice and very clean clinic.

The clinic assistant Ms Mei Ling is such a friendly and helpful person. I felt even glad to have Dr Paul professional checks and advice.
This is one of the few clinics where patients are treated with much care and with mutual respect.

Unlike some  other clinics, the nurse assistants can be rude just because of 'work pressure'.

My thanks & kudos to Ang Mo Kio Medical Centre team . ♡",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106758992362011440713/reviews
RICHARD ANG,5,"Dr senior tan is very experience and approachable doctor! He will shared and explained in simple medical term about your illness.
I once injured my right leg tendon and was suffering from internal inflammation.
I was limping for weeks!
After one injection at the right spot on my right leg, I was able to walk with less pain instantly.
A few days later, I had fully recovered from pain and could walk as normal already...
Thank you Dr senior tan...",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117776935304292526005/reviews
KT,3,"Doctors are practical, friendly so the stars are for them. Receptionists are incredibly rude, blaming the patients when it is their scheduling/hearing error, their tone has never been friendly nor have they been helpful. Not great if you are feeling ok but worse if you are already ill. Avoided going here unless I have to.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113412142053561073133/reviews
