Hannah Schwardtmann,1,"Poor customer service! The first time I‚Äôve been in the clinic, they assigned me to an unexperienced therapist, who is not even a dermatologist but a flight attendant who had ONE MONTH of training in Aivee Clinic Singapore. How could you allow this kind of service!  My skin is very sensitive and I have made this clear from the start. However, the doctor‚Äôs assessment was always on a grey area of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see what will happen‚Äù. Let‚Äôs try this or that. I thought its just my face adjusting to their treatment and products so I came the second time around. This time the doctor recommended to do a Diamond Peel plus some other treatment and a change of products for skin maintenance. It made my skin breakout even more! I‚Äôm not recommending this clinic especially if you want your skin to look better and get the value for what you pay for.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110326963859644428194/reviews
Ryan Pamintuan,5,"I used to have acne and dry skin around my lips. I have been desperately looking for clinics and tried countless products for my face unfortunately they did not work for my skin. It even worsened my pimple at one point.

Aivee Clinic gave solutions to my problem. The consultation was so bespoke that they highlighted my needs. I highly recommend Aerolase and GLP for my pimples. It has been 4 weeks since I tried these services and face looks rejuvenated, glowing and my pimples significantly reduce by almost 80-90%

Thank you to my therapist Ruby for taking of my face and for giving an excellent service. Thank you to Dr. Abi for your help. I also want to give credit to staffs as they are very professional.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115726250044648985715/reviews
Vanessa Castro,5,I have been looking for a clinic who can help with me with my weight lost journey and acnes. It made me soooooo depressed because of it. A good friend of mine recommended Aivee clinic SG. I was kinda hesitant to go there but i gave them a benefit of the doubt. Now I have been a patient with them for a year!!! They helped me to bring back my self esteem and now I am confident to face the world! Keep it up Aivee sg!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104437859813783154962/reviews
Dani Vitriolo,1,"It's my first time to see a dermatological clinic that doesn't give an official diagnosis report in the invoice. It makes me question their authenticity. I only go because they waive their consultation fee every time you get isotretinoin. Otherwise, I would not go.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103704502291420919054/reviews
