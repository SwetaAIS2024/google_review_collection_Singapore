Reagan Tan,5,"I super recommend Luxe Maison!! Look for Michelle, she is super patience and kind to let me see all the colors and design that I like!
Importantly, She gave me her honest opinion of what color and size of the bag that suits me and my hubby! I will look for her and recommend her to my friends.
Ask for Michelle when you visit Luxe Maison! ü•∞",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101475028416653864534/reviews

Location - 5/5
As a new customer, had a very good experience in Luxe Maison shop, was there for about 2hours trying out the bags and was attended to patiently. Explanation was clear too. Will come back and buy again. Highly recommended.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107577513445149525727/reviews

Rohin Pathak,1,"Horrible saleswoman, absolutely condescending, can‚Äôt differentiate between a kelly or a birkin neither can she differentiate the kind of leathers or hardware.

Extremely racist and does not understand quiet luxury, looked me up and down asking me how can I afford any of these bags because I am not from her defined ‚Äúwealthy country‚Äù

Looking forward to reporting this store to the better business bureau, will make sure they are not allowed to sell their sham products again to anyone.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101360633407417123288/reviews
