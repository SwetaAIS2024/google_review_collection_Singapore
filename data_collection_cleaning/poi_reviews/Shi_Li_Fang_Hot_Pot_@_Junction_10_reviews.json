She makes friendly conversations and patiently explained about the promotions and proceed to direct me to take a seat. Inside, the manager and many staffs are very proactive. Always ready to assist me with the new digital ordering system. Previously, they had to use stamps for collect n redemption. Now is all points. Food wise, no complaints. Many options. Worth the price. Now alcohol beverages had been included. Some branches allow paywave payment. This one doesn't have paywave. Would come again by soon.",

      "text": "Review of Shi Li Fang Hot Pot @ Junction 10\n\nToday, I went to Shi Li Fang Hot Pot at Junction 10 for a last-minute meal after seeing an online offer to book a table. All the food was excellent, and I especially enjoyed the option to make my own sauce. The drinks were limited to $1, but you can top up frequently without having to pay extra unless you want something more premium.\n\nHowever, I found the ice cream disappointing; the flavor wasn’t strong and lacked aroma. I suggest improving the ice cream quality.\n\nThank you!",
