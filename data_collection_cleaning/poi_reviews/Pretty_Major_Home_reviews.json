The pan is deep enough and comes with a steaming basket, which makes it perfect for steaming items. We‚Äôve cooked sunny side ups and even pork belly in the pan and it‚Äôs really completely non-stick - making it so easy for us to wash up after cooking ü•∞ we also have their beautiful wall art that‚Äôs a great addition to our home, the textures just add so much dimensions to our otherwise boring study room!",

On top of that, the quality of the painting is VERY GOOD and it's affordable as well. Definitely buying more to add to the collection.",
