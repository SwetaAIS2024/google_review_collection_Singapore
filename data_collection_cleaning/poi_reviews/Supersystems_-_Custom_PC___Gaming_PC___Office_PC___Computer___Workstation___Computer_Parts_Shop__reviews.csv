PGR MALD,5,"Purchased a custom pc from seller. Seller was very patient and very knowledgeable. I reached out to the seller very late at night but seller still responded promptly and was available to engage in long discussions on the parts.
Once the parts were decided, seller assembled and conducted all necessary stress tests on the assembled PC. Highly efficient and skilled.
From initial contact to PC arrival, it look less than 2 days.
Price is reasonable and service is AMAZING! Better than any big market sellers out there.
