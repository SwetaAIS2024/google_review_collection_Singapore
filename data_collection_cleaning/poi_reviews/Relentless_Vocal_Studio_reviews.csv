Ben,5,"Had a trial lesson with Ariel for vocal coaching, and it was a great experience! Before the lesson, I struggled with tension, particularly on high notes. With Ariel's guidance, I was able to sing more freely and comfortably. She is incredibly patient and knowledgeable, making the learning process enjoyable. I highly recommend her classes to anyone interested in giving singing lessons a try!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111128368830879201940/reviews
