Leonard Lim,4,"If you like your char siu a little fatty and with roasted blackened bits (reminds me of KL style) and good roasted pork give it a try at Delight HK Roasted Style.

$5.50 for char siu roasted pork noodles with good serving of meat.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101173751535810787329/reviews
Rui,5,"Always wanted to try this place and found a gem in the neighbourhood.

The curry fish head is of good size, fleshy and very yummy.

I am utterly impressed by the chai po beancurd which was crispy on the outside and silky soft on the inside, drizzled lavishly with a savoury light sauce with a sweetish aftertaste.

Will be back for more dishes.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101693177281044001072/reviews
Lina Magiar,4,"Probably the best briyani in the west area..fluffy,well spiced basmati rice cooked to perfection served with a spoonful of acar and choice of mutton,chicken or fried chicken meat accompanied with a good, thick dhal gravy priced at $5.50 per plate.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110114078677642526688/reviews
Daniel Seah,4,"Ate the Flower Crab Pao Fan ($38) and the Ginseng Chicken Pao Fan ($35). The flavour of the soup was great, but the Pao Fan was nothing to rave about. It was essentially slightly fried rice put into soup. For how much crowds there are, and how quickly they run out of stock.... It is unlikely I will be back.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110646172448693971092/reviews
