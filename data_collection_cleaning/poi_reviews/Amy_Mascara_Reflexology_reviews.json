      "text": "It was a last minute booking as my body was so sore. Good point is that the place open earlier compared to other places in the same vicinity.\nIt is a good thing if you googled how to go there beforehand to avoid walking aimlessly. The location is just behind former Jen Hotel which you can park your car at roadside then walk for about 3 minutes.\nMasseur no. 7 is so good with the pressure point and customed the pressure to my liking.\nThe only downside is privacy. The premise rather small but trying to cater to high volume of customers during weekend thus you won't get private room. The massage area is separated by curtain and people still can see your silhouette. They also has male masseur for male customer thus if you prefer more privacy, I wouldn't recommend this place.\nLuckily for me that there is no one else aside from me during the booking and the masseur is so good at her job thus the 4 star rate.",

      "text": "I've been to several spas and reflexology centres but something about amy mascara reflexology that keeps me coming back. Tried the full body massage, foot only and latest shoulder head foot all worth it! The price is very reasonable too. The staff is very hospitable and they make me feel so relaxed afterwards. They even have different modes of massage; will adjust to your liking and will share why certain areas feel sore when massaged so loving the skill and friendliness there. Highly recommend to try. I prefer Masseuse Resi No 2 so I'll ask for her each time i go there. They give free water and hot ginger tea in each visit (u may decline if u dont want no problem).",

The massage was incredibly relaxing and skillfully executed, providing just the right amount of pressure. Iâ€™ll definitely be returning for another session with her soon! Highly recommend!",
