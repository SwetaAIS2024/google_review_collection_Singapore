I initially ordered just one to share since there were so many other dishes I wanted to try nearby, but I instantly regretted not getting my own. The flavors were so good that I’ll definitely order more serving next time.\n\nI also tried the Rojak, and it did not disappoint! Both dishes were flavorful and satisfying.",

Same with the kueh pie tee - they also use a very fine scrambled egg here, which I think gives less texture compared to chopped hard boil egg. They also don't use prawn (as far as I could tell).",
