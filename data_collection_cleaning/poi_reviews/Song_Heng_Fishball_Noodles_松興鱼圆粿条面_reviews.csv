Had fishball noodle dry ($4) for breakfast, was good. The noodle was well prepared, al denta & chilli was good. Do note that they only serve the noodle with fishball.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
roger heng,1,"Over rated and definitely not Gem…noodles water did not change, can taste that after effect. MSG lovers will love this stall, Stall owner does not allow to up size noodles and push you for adding fishball instead. This is more for entry level Fishball noodles.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103720153038338570905/reviews
C K Leong (Ah Leong San),5,"I’ve eaten here before but not written about it because the long queue told me it’s a very popular stall. Though there are quite a number of good fishball noodle stalls, this has constantly long queue. It sells a standard price of $4 per bowl which is great for the social economic status in this neighborhood. The fishballs are definitely handmade as the presence of big containers to make them. The fishball is really firm in texture and not too salty too. Noodles were well cooked al dente. For $4 with 5 handmade fishballs this is definitely one of my favorite fishball stalls. Please note it opens only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108882315597576503809/reviews
Mike C,4,"Dish brings back memory of eating at school canteen, ages ago. Rice Noodle  pretty good, except the yellow noodle taste somewhat synthetic. Fishball quite alright. Auntie taking orders is friendly. For the price comes with generous portion of noodles, good value for money.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112922793448186417464/reviews
KC Go,5,"This is one of the only few hawkers stall I give 5 stars.
This stall is very old could have from 1960 in tiong bahru and move here.
It is always very long queue and never stop. They only work 4 days a week.
Mee pok cook to perfect, it is firm and close to hard, but there is why I like it like Italian pasta. The sauce mixing is super good with vinegar and chilli. This must be thru years of experience to get this complex taste.
$4 portions is big with 5 fish ball, you can try $5 for 8 fish ball.
Another good about this famous stall is the owner is extremely friendly, the typical teow chew style. Smiling all the way.
It is a stall that die die must try",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113085314295831061614/reviews
