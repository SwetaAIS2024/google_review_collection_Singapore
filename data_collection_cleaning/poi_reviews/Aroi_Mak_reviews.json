Chilli is not too spicy with a nice bite (Asian palate). Food standard is promising and I wish them every success.",

      "text": "Glad to have found this homely newcomer to the CBD food scene at the ground floor of The Sail. The pad thai was freshly cooked in front of me using quality ingredients, and certainly tasted the part. The chef is Thai and cooks the dishes as her mum does in her hometown. Could not try their signature basil leaf and pork rice because their basil from Thailand would only arrive in two days. They said they only use Thai basil because it tastes better than local stock - Iâ€™ll definitely be back to be the judge of that!",

Everything was fresh, tasty, a bit spicy from dry grounded chilli (shame on me as I am Thai I should be fine with this spicy LOL). The Thai lady owner was really sweet. Recommended for a quick take away lunch here.",
