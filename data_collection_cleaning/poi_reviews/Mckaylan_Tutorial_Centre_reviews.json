      "text": "I'm very grateful to be taught by Ms Janice throughout Sec 4. I joined her in Sec 3 (after my end of year exams) and have been with her for a year. I jumped from getting a C5-C6 to attaining a B3 in my O-levels! Ms Janice is an incredibly dedicated, humorous and kind teacher everyone wishes for! She will always encourage you to do your best and her lessons are never boring :) I always looked forward to going for her tuitions. Honestly, it was her faith in me that kept me going and motivated me to work even harder to improve my English. Thank you so much for teaching me Ms Janice!! :))",

In primary school, her quizzes and games made learning enjoyable. Reuniting in Secondary 3, her guidance helped me improve my English grade from B3 in Secondary 2 to A1 in Secondary 3!!! Teacher Janice's teaching style, materials, and encouragement gave me confidence and motivation to work harder. I'm thankful for her dedication and passion ðŸ˜»ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜‹",

      "text": "I am the 2024 batch of P6s, Megann. When I first joined Mckaylan (p5) I was weak in English and scored AL 4, I also failed the tests I took at the centre. However, after much effort I had put in, as well as the materials that teacher Janice had provided for her students, I managed to score AL 2 for the Primary School Leaving Examination. I found that the worksheets I had revised from Mckaylan were very useful and interesting, helping me in remembering more of the grammar rules and the spelling of difficult words. Thank you teacher Janice for your guidance and support!",

Both of them enjoy every lesson there and look forward to attending class every week. Ms Janice has a creative way of engaging the students, making teaching fun, and at the same time imparting knowledge to them. She is also patient and approachable, and motivates my boys beyond study. I am grateful to her for teaching and helping my boys especially my eldest boy through these years.",
