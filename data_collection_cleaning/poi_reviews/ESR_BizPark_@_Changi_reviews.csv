Zareena Reena,1,"I am very unhappy with an Indian security guard on duty on the 2 January 2025 at 9pm. I was resting at an outside common area enjoying a snack where there werent any indication no food or drinks allowed, just resting. Out of no where this indian Security guard raised his voice to me telling me I weren't allowed to eat and I shouldn't litter.... ( I didn't) He was being a very rude and unprofessional. If I was in the wrong (which I don't think I was) I think there are better ways to approach  me, and not shout across to me. I expected better services here and this is my first time ever experiencing such an incident. I hope action will be taken as such an act refect badly on esr bizpark changi business park.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114217181849048914460/reviews

Ty Yap,5,I would like to share my experience while in this building. I lost my cards wallet in the building.  It is very careless of me. Went round searching but could not find.  Decide to have late lunch at Song Fa Bak Kut Teh ( i strongly recommend). While having lunch the security of the building approach me through the server whether I lost a wallet.  I was shocked they go round the building looking for me. It reflected the culture of the maintenance team. Honesty and integrity !!  I also strongly recommend to have lunch here.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107010208262873719764/reviews
