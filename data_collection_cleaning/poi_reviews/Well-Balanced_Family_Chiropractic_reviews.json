      "text": "I’ve been receiving chiropractic treatment from Dr. Jason for the past few months, and the improvements have been amazing. Before starting treatment, I often had headaches and even felt breathless at times, along with pain in my neck and back. He adjusted my posture, which made a big difference. Since then, all of these issues have gotten much better. He’s very friendly, professional, and always careful during treatment. I appreciate how he takes the time to explain everything and ensures I’m comfortable throughout the process. I feel much better now ！",

Significant progress has been made and allows me to return to a more active lifestyle without pain. As someone who is new to chiro, it has been a great experience and value for money. Highly recommend if you are looking for a clinic in the east as the location is near the MRT.\n\nBoth Dr Yen Ee and Dr Jason are very friendly and good at providing care, along with the lovely clinic staff Chie and Clai as well. It is very easy to schedule appointments using their online system or WhatsApp.",
