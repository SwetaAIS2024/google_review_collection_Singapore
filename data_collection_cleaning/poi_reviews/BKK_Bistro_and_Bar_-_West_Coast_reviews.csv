Calbee Cracker,4,Authentic Thai food in airy foodcourt setting. The herb and Tom yum broth for the boat noodles were delicious. The beef ball in the boat noodle was so soft. The grilled meat- Moo ping and pork collar were soft and well marinated too. We were pretty amused by the rainbow sticky rice but it tasted better than it looked! Overall a great first impression and we will be back to try more dishes.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110229110724135670872/reviews

Stella Teng,4,"Housed within West Coast wholesale centre food court.

Bistro would be indoor a/c setting or outdoor.

Live band is right outside of the indoor glass door. I think is every 1st Friday of the month for this band.

Mookata is outdoor seating.

2day was chill weather, good for Mookata. The ingredients prawn, cray fish were very fresh, but the grill plate itself takes too long to grill, not sure if is the airy/windy environment or the thick grill plate that is time consuming ðŸ˜‚

Then we order bistro food, wasabi fries and cripsy pork, these score back the lost points!

Toilet (foodcourt): Male, I don't know, comment was not so good. Female, at least it is dry floor, but each cubicle quite small.

Will go back for bistro food when the weather is good, as the live band was fabulous and good bistro food to enjoy with!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100319311626469387872/reviews

Jollypeppermint,2,"We ordered a snack basket which did not come. When we asked the lady staff (pink hair) if the order is coming, she said there are only two chefs and will need a bit of time to prep. But then she did not bother to check with the kitchen to see if the order was in preparation or if it was missed. Second time we asked another staff and she said will check but did not get back to us. Third time we asked the pink hair lady again to check and told her that if it is not being prepared, we want to cancel the order. And then she came back to tell us the order was missed.

Understand that they are shortstaffed but their service is seriously very disappointing. After cancelling the order, the pink hair lady still had the audacity to show black face.

Will not revisit the bistro again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100737184672881303297/reviews
