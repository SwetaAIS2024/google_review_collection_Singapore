The staff are always helpful and pleasant, but Ms. Helen ( a senior lady on duty today at around 2-3 pm ) truly stood out. Her kind and empathetic nature shone through as she offered cost-saving bulk purchase advice and ensured I could comfortably carry my items. Her genuine concern was heartwarming and commendable. Thank you, Ms. Helen, for exceptional service!",
