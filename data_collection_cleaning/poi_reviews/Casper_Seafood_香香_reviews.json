This suggests that the horfun was pre fried and simply reheated with the sauce upon ordering. Sauce was average, ingredients were passable but horfun was partially burnt and clumped together in parts. Chao tar, not wok hei. Do not recommend.",

      "text": "My 2nd visit after trying their neighbor Bak Kut Teh and steam fish few days ago. They both share the same space in this coffeeshop or restaurant. No aircon, just open air with fans. Great atmosphere especially during year end Christmas season, cooling and windy, hot sun is hardly exist.\n\nInitially we wish to order curry fishhead, but owner insisted trying their tomyam flavor, and we are convinced.\n\nYes. It was really good flavour and fresh fish. The flavor was quite unique, unlike usual tomyam spicy and sour taste, their version are more like thin curry with tomyam spices, not too spicy, and with slight sour taste.\n\nFish head size was okay, but not really large, price slightly high, usually $27+ but they charged $30 for their selection. Most importantly, the taste and large amount of veggies was still worth it.\n\nThe sweet and sour pork, we liked it very much, meat was decent, is crispy with great sweet and sour flavors. Added another stir-fry vegetables, not a bad plate of green too, is enough for two of us with great simple flavor.\n\nSweet and sour pork priced and $12 and vegetable cost $8. Still a affordable food selection and pricing. Overall, we loved it. Conclusion, we will definitely come back. Recommended.\n\nüí• Welcome to my food sharing Instagram: jkgourmets.

Only a bit expensive.\n\nHor fun wok hey yes but still can improve. The gravy is diluted and plain. I guess it is complacency or too tired. I wonder about the rest of the dishes. If Hor fun is not done right, how can I continue with the rest of the dishes?  I gave 3 stars as I yet to try the rest.üòâü§≠",

Seated easily, at a round table.\nOrdered claypot fish head and our favorite yam ring.\n\nThe claypot fish head is small. Sauce is slightly on the sweet side unfortunately.\n\nDate of visit: Sun 23 Jul 2023\nTime : 8.30 pm\n\nThis time ordered the yam ring and stir fried Â•∂ÁôΩËèú vegetables.\n\nThe yam ring stuffings are very generous and packed with vegetables, mushrooms, prawns and chicken meat.\n\nReally good food. A bit too much for 2 of us. The yam ring would suffice.\n\nCost us $29.60 with 2 rice.\n\nDate of visit: Thurs 6 Jul 2023\nTime 9 pm\n\nThis time ordered the assam fish head for 2 plus 2 rice.\nAssam fish head just as good. Sour sweet and saltiness the right flavor.\n\nDate of visit: Sun 11 Jun 2023\nTime 8.30 pm\n\nA small coffee shop with this zhi char stall and a bak kut teh stall beside.\n\nMost tables seated.\n\nOrdered just a curry fish head to try. Only 2 of us.\n\nFlavors good, even slightly on the sourish side making the curry not too heavy going. The half fish head is small but fresh. Vegetables brinjal, lady fingers, cabbage all good and some dried tau pok soso.",
