Jeong Min Kim,5,"Ms Bonnie Koh was my piano teacher ever since I started on my piano journey during my primary school years. All in all, I was with her since I was in primary school until my college years. She is ever  patient with me, which I think it is the best virtue any teacher ought to have, and will point out any blunders with my playing and correct them accordingly.

Thank you, Ms Koh, for the wonderful years of imparting your musical skills to me. I really did not regret taking up music as a side hobby as I have moved on to self-learn the violin, and as of late, the drums as well.

Music has become part of my life. Thank you!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101702648949740871929/reviews

Silantr0_o,5,"I've been a student here for close to 10 years, and I can safely say that Ms Koh has been a wonderful teacher throughout those years. She is very friendly and open towards her students to make them feel at ease, while also willing to give necessary critisicm when needed, something which was not present from my previous teachers. Her teaching has opened my eyes to how classical music can be played and intepreted to express certain emotions effectively, and I've learned a lot of techniques on how I can improve my piano playing as well.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108153904580077871096/reviews
