      "text": "A bit disappointed.  Ordered 5 dishes and mainly chef recommendation. Only 2 dishes are considered to be good.  The other 3, can forget about it.\n\nChar siew (supposing highly recommended) - 1/5. Meat so dry and tough.  No fatty part? too lean.  marination over do it.\nSalted egg fish -2.5/5.   Nothing special\nRoast chicken - 2/5. Hate the colour of the chicken.  Looks artificial coloring.  Meat so dead.\nTofu with fried radish - one of the good one.  But I don’t really taste the radish.\nEgg plant with pork floss - this one not bad.\n\nThe chicken taste the most normal and yet most expensive.  Don’t know why.\n\nThe service is excellent.\n\nWill go there is I have 25h a day.",

We had the Yu Sheng with Ice Vegetable—it was very unique and shiok. The pork livers were super delicious, and every dish we ordered was tasty. Just a heads-up, the prawns were quite expensive, got a shock when I saw the bill—$78! Despite that, we had a very happy lunch, served by friendly and cheerful waitresses",

No one is grouchy here, extra friendly good vibes! A lot of parking but lack of lifts at carpark. There is a ramp at block 4 (around middle of the block), go up the ramp and u will see a lift. Good for elderly, wheelchair and pram.",

The dark coloured noodles are from Kuala Lumpur and they are filled with delicious crispy lard. It was the best noodles I have tasted. I recommend both dark noodles and vermicelli noodles. They are unique and really tasty.",
