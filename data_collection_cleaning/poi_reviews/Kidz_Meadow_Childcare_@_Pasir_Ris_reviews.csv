Naz Lin,5,"Teachers, across all levels, are caring, loving and gentle when handling the children. They also display a positive, cheery outlook when receiving students in the mornings, and send off the students lovingly at dismissal. They would know the names of most, if not all, of the students, creating a healthy bond between students and teachers.
The Nature Magnified curriculum is also interesting and teaches the students to be more respectful and appreciative of nature.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103900360249384468443/reviews
