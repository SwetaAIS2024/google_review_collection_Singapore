Cleve Tan,5,"Second outlet of Breakfast Grill and they still don't disappoint. Sandwiches are great, especially the BFF - the fish is amazing. If you're not there for the food, the strawberry matcha is a MUST try, authentic Japanese matcha that is hard to find. Nice as a midday coffee spot too. Highly recommend.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104847247881129653723/reviews
WAGEWORTH PTE LTD,5,"Easy 5 stars!
I used to frequent the East Coast outlet, so I was thrilled to hear they’ve opened a new branch in the West—had to check it out! Still absolutely love their sammies and pastas. Not many people seem to know they’re open for dinner too, which is a shame because their pasta dishes are seriously underrated. If you go, don’t miss the prawn pasta and the mentaiko mac udon—both are amazing. Coffee’s strong and top-notch, just the way I like it. Staff are always friendly, and the cozy atmosphere makes it a great place to kickstart your day or wind down in the evening.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102342942081098773888/reviews

OWN,5,"I had an absolutely delightful experience at this restaurant. From the moment we walked in, the ambience was warm and inviting—tastefully decorated with just the right balance of elegance and comfort. The service was impeccable throughout; the staff were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely welcoming, making us feel well taken care of without being intrusive.

But the highlight was, without a doubt, the food. Every dish we tried was nothing short of amazing, both in taste and presentation. The flavors were rich and well-balanced, and the textures were perfectly executed—from crisp and fresh starters to tender mains that melted in the mouth. You could tell that great care was taken with each ingredient and preparation.

Whether it was the appetizers, mains, or desserts, everything exceeded expectations. It’s rare to find a place where every item on the menu delivers such consistency in quality. I can confidently say this is one of the best dining experiences I’ve had in a long time. Highly recommended for anyone who truly appreciates good food and a memorable overall experience.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107722870932776944737/reviews
"Xue Qi, Stella Tan",5,"Had a really positive dining experience here! Ordered the Maple Toast, BFF, and Shakshouka. The BFF was soooo good and I’m not even a fan of fish? My friends and I were very impressed! Really like the Maple Toast as well - it’s light and fluffy! Matcha strawberry and black sesame latte were great too. Will definitely be returning to try the other dishes on the menu!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101548803214853636383/reviews
