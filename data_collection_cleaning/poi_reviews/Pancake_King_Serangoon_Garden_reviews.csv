Boon Leong,4,"Loved their minjiang kueh
soft, slightly chewy exterior filled with a fragrant, sweet coconut filling.
the grated coconut inside is rich, aromatic, and just sweet enough without being overpowering.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118439101019407877742/reviews
Elna Tan,5,"Ordered the peanut pancake , banana cake, walnut butter and spring roll for take away. Peanut pancake is outstanding with crispy edges which I enjoyed within one hour from buying",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115813988242309284143/reviews
Akankshita Dash,1,"Second time visiting and instead of the peanut waffle, i got the walnut chocolate cake slice. Quite dry and stale (and I suspect this is not a fresh slice as the auntie did not pick one from the display, but from somewhere inside the store). Auntie‚Äôs service was also quite rude - she firstly told me to order right away (even though there was no queue behind me) and as I was reaching up to collect she asked me sharply to pay (my transaction had just gone through). This is singapore - I am not going to steal your food and run away‚Ä¶ do not recommend visiting this place.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111588389922084472221/reviews
Kendrick Wee,4,"Flavor was good. Harder to get these sort of pancake (ie loose peanut filling). However, the skin was no longer crispy when I finally get to eat it after an hour or so.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793547912532718349/reviews
Jackson Tan (Jackthehunter),5,The best I've tasted! It is crispy which not many has and peanuts smells very nice and tasty! Love the red bean and coconut ones as well! They will normally make and sell rather than make a lot and put there waiting for customers to buy. Always go and buy every fortnightly cos near my residence. ü§©üëç,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110191915028815430983/reviews
