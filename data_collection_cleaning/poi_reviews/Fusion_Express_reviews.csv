Aemil Harithz,3,"I eat here on a consistent weekly basis for the past 3 years, and I can guarantee 3 things:

1) Big/Oversized portions for their protein (Value for money!)
2) Taste is consistent across all my visits
3) Waiting time when ordering in person is between 10 to 20 minutes

My go-to is the Black Pepper Chicken Chop with French Fries and Coleslaw. Black Pepper sauce lacks strong pepper taste, but it is still flavourful. More akin to Brown Sauce than Black Pepper. French Fries are shoestring and seasoned with salt. Coleslaw is too creamy and thick for my liking, sometimes I eat it all up, other times I do not.

I recommend this place only because its one of the few halal options in the area, portions are big and price is affordable.

However, I do not recommend the Fried Chicken Cutlet. Ordered it 5-10 times and have always been disappointed with the chicken. Cutlet is fried in a awkward shape and is difficult to slice. Too much breading as well.

Overall, if you like it, lucky you. If you don't like it, too bad :(",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114896509902634341966/reviews
Onigiri MAYO,5,"Bang for your bucks!
Super big portions, decent waiting time and the aunty that served me was very nice.

All the takeaways are wrapped in aluminium foil to keep food hot.

The creamy chicken chop's sauce is amazing. We ordered a cheesy fried fish, although it's still warm and tasted good, the fried batter was soggy by the time I reach home, better to dine in all the fried food.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103056309661248368012/reviews
Mangali Lee,2,"Ordered fried rice with chicken chop.
However, the rice is just plain rice with some topping.
Can't even smell or taste fried rice.
Chicken chop is hard.
Disappointed.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108397823097716168715/reviews
Niyaz Aqmar,5,"Seriously great, if not very generous portions for their chicken chops AND side dishes. Overall those chicken chops or crispy fish I highly recommend. It's so good you can even eat it till you're full with leftovers. All-in-all, these for 8+ dollars? Why not give this a shot?

(Better to get this dine in than delivery imo)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112828185940556345495/reviews
amsyar,3,"The food was decent at most. A positive aspect was the generous portion size, though the flavor was fairly ordinary. It's a good bang for your buck and suitable for those seeking an affordable Western meal. The menu doesn't stand out in any particular way. Visited during a quieter time on Tuesday, waited about 10-15 mins for the order, no issues. Overall, it's an average Western food spot situated in a coffee shop setting.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117936316331341029317/reviews
