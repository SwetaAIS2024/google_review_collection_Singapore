Was walking around the area & decided to check this out. Located in the former Henderson Sec Sch compound. Good to see some ""farming"" here. F&B outlets available. Parking is available too. Saw some activities conducted for kids.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
Winston Teo,5,"I recently participated in an educational tour and volunteering session at City Sprouts in Henderson, and it was a fantastic experience! We spent the day weeding, planting, and engaging in team-building activities, which was both enjoyable and rewarding.

The youthful volunteers, tour guides, and team bonding facilitators were cheerful, well-informed, and made the entire experience even more enjoyable. They taught us about various spices, fruits, and vegetables, along with their health benefits.

One of the highlights was a team challenge, to prepare the best meal with fruits from the farm. Also interesting,  was learning about the use of Tilapia fish in vertical farming – a fascinating and sustainable practice.

The day was well-organized, with games and a delicious buffet lunch that provided the perfect break and a chance to bond with our team. Overall, City Sprouts offers a unique and educational experience that I highly recommend for anyone interested in urban farming and sustainability.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103983640077681957103/reviews
Joyce Wang,5,"Our recent farm visit was a wonderful learning journey for our Year 5 students. The experience was both educational and engaging. The teachers who led the activities did an excellent job explaining everything clearly and interactively, which really captured the students’ attention.

One of the highlights of the visit was the hands-on activity where students made their own self-watering planters. They were very enthusiastic and took great care in creating their planters. Each student brought theirs back to school, where they are now observing the growth of the plants with excitement and curiosity.

Overall, it was a meaningful and enjoyable trip that sparked interest in nature and sustainability. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100066668793097012934/reviews
Wei Liang Ng,5,"Great place to hang out with family and children. The urban farm makes it a fun and quaint experience of a farm in the city, to see different species of plants and also some animals! The small eatery which used to be a school canteen mainly sells Thai food.

Overall, reusing a closed school is a great idea as it preserves the memories of people who went through this school and creates new memories with the updated programs for everyone to enjoy!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107695499222427573277/reviews
Jiexin Fang,5,"We were coming on our own with kids but met Li Li who was friendly and kind to offer us a tour to show us the chicken coop, aquaponics with fish tank and other plants, despite the hot weather. Thank you Li Li and the boss who converted this closed school compound into such an educational and meaningful farm open to the public.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110396851352353907849/reviews
