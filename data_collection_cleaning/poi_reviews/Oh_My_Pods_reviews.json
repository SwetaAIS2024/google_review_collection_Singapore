I stayed there and rent >15 pods, turns out the owner gave us the whole room so we didn't share room with other guests. Has 3 bathrooms, laundry area, living room, kitchen, and praying spot. The minus is, it didnt have elevator. Stairs only. Kinda struggling for guests with lots of lugages ðŸ¥´",

The breakfast they have is only bread butter jam etc but this theme is nowhere available at this price so over all it's good if you are A bachelor",
