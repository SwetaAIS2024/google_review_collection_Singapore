Though it's made by their machine, it guarantees consistency on the mixture--which is always rich and of the right sweetness.\n\nThe Fishball Noodle or Mushroom Minced Meat Noodle is the stall that is mostly frequented by people here. Obvious with it's long queue all the time. Just wish they can have a way to manage it better or get the orders faster via online or qr code ordering. But then again, it's an old school coffeeshop so understandable.",
