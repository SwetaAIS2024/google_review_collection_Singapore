Jy S,5,"My daughter is learning the violin from Ms. Narin and has been taking lessons for about three months. She finds it incredibly fun and enjoyable. Before enrolling in this academy, I inquired about private lessons and various other academies. What I was looking for was a teacher with professional experience in violin performance. Ms. Narin seemed like the best choice, and after the trial lesson, we made the decision right away.

She is guiding my daughter, who is still in the early stages, with proper posture and accurate playing techniques while leading her with charisma. At the same time, she explains things kindly, which motivates my daughter to continue learning the violin.

Additionally, the manager who greets us warmly every time we walk in is always so kind and welcoming. Thank you for your continued support!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117120891561881153229/reviews
zaw htet,5,"I highly recommend Music LifeStyle Academy and Ms. Lanice as a piano teacher. The academy offers a supportive and professional environment that nurtures a love for music and a dedication to excellence.

Ms. Lanice's teaching is outstanding. She combines rigorous musical education with a solid foundation in music theory, following the ABRSM syllabus closely. Her strength lies in her ability to teach young children, emphasizing proper posture and technique from the beginning to build good habits and a deeper understanding of music.

Thanks to her dedication, patience, and passion, my daughter has made great progress in both her playing and theoretical knowledge. Music LifeStyle Academy and Ms. Lanice provide top-quality musical education, and I highly recommend them to any parent.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115217363824624358494/reviews
