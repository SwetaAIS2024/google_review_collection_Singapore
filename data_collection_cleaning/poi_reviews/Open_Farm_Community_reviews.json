Both sauces in the dish were delish.\n\nThe mango trifle dessert was the bomb! It was refreshing and tart and sweet - wish there was more.\n\nPortions were on the smallish side, so much so that we went next door to Tiong Bahru bakery for pastries and coffee.\n\nWater costs $3 per person but is refillable.\n\nThe place looks rustic while the missus says it needs some upkeep. Staff were friendly and service was relatively quick.",

I tried the oysters, the pasta with eggplant, and the dessert, and I was absolutely blown away by the flavors. The concept of the restaurant is fantastic, and the managers are incredibly friendly.

Thank you for such a delicious meal! I can't wait to return!\n\n---",

      "text": "Peaceful ambience. Staff was patient to describe the dishes. But the food was average for a Michelin guide although they were fresh. The wagyu beef was not tender. The slipper lobster roll had more veggies and sauce than meat. The scallops were alright but the price was similar to the mains. The bread pudding was not bad, not too sweet but can be heavy for a dessert. The kaya latte deserves a shoutout as it was fragrant and flavourful without being too sweet. Overall a pleasant dining experience but dishes can be improved.",

      "text": "Came to explore the idea of a local produce. Partook in their lunch menu and a few options from their ala carte menu. The highlight of the meal was the tuna tataki (the sauce was very flavorful) and their koji ice cream.\n\nThe pomelo & wild greens salad was quite disappointing. Very underseasoned and left a puddle of water after eating (as shown in the pics).; I didn't taste as nice as it was described. The bread was decent but their flavored butter was also.under salted. I ordered a farmer's pick cocktail, expecting a unique twist on their farm based flavors, and gotten a simple gin cocktail with Cucumber muddled.\n\nService wise is lacking. They dont accept cash and the service felt under trained. The chefs looked bored as they were using their phones during service in an open kitchen.\nMixed Feelings about coming back.",
