      "text": "Their three treasures (duck, char siew and roast pork) noodle is not too bad.   Reasonable portion for the price ($7).  It is the same price for the three treasures rice.  I thought they might charge more for the noodle, but they did not.\n\nNothing to complain about their noodles.  I was happy with the meal.\n\nTaste 4/5\n\nHaving said that, I'd advise against ordering the dumplings.  The filling was very salty and also tasted off - perhaps it had been in the freezer for a very long time.\n\nTaste 2/5",
