Gina,1,The new deliveryman who deliver to the canteen at the west side area is so irresponsible. Being a regular customer for so many years. Recently told him that eggs are not handled properly. Received some broken eggs left unchecked cause bad smell and is not the first time next time please double check. Yet he didn't said anything just give me a black face and left. What kind of attitude is this? I'm not going to order from this supplier anymore!,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102754266342845769644/reviews

Mak 3,3,The eggs have very good quality but they are not handled properly.  I used to order from them few months back for my minimart . Sometimes the eggs have this broken egg residue that is very difficult to see with the red coloured packaging. After few days if left unchecked will have maggots and bad smell. I am unwillingly to have the trust to order again.  My current supplier the driver really checks and packs the eggs inside his van when he arrives and hands it to me . I have the trust in him that I don't even have to check. Maybe 1 in 20 orders across 3 months only have 1 egg broken in 1 packet.  Build that trust with ur customers üëç,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114441247205550543692/reviews
