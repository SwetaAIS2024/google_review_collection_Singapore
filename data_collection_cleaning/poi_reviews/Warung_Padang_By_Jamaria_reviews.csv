Z,2,"1 begedil, 1 egg, 1 beehoon/ Mee goreng and 1 chicken, $8.50

Be ready to pay a bomb for this breakfastüòÇüòÇ

The begedil was not bad! Egg is normal. The fried chicken is okok. Beehoon and noodle not bad.. The food overall was a bit cold though.. for the price.. I don't think is worth it to eat at this stall. The portion not say it's a lot..

Maybe should try Mee soto or lontong for hot food.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105667617273316993236/reviews

Jackie Thang,2,"Taste is fine... but lontong gravy is cold hence making the rice taste uncooked. And it is too expensive.

Lontong + a little bit of tempeh... $6.  When asked this quantity of tempeh charge $2, she just look at me and smile.

If wanna charge $2, by all means, but at least give more.

Clean renovated environment though.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114576721210569560185/reviews
Olive Moha,3,"First and second breakfast is ok..then when the third breakfast,the fried mee is salty. The fourth time also salty and too much seasoning i think..after that no more buying at this restaurant.

Nazreen Raimi (Nash),3,"Order rice,sambal goreng,paru sambal and ayam curry $7.Price is ok.The part that im not happy is that why is some of the rice so hard.Did u check before servin someone? Or u purposely dont want to waste the rice thats y u still serve to customer.U must understand this we r paid customer we r not gettin the food for free.So we deserve fresh quality of food.Thats not all even the chicken i choose u gave me so stingy.3 pieces of chicken that has been cut like a piece of nugget.2 pieces meat with bone on it and the other piece u gave me is a chicken that has no meat on it.more to bone.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Pls avoid being stingy when ur sellin food.Cause u want customer to come back not run away.If u keep being like this no customer will want to come back to ur stall.And u r lookin at it.This will be the last time im goin to ur stall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116484743936843476416/reviews
