      "text": "The toilets are very clean, would recommend. However, the lights are motion activated and after 6.30-7pm it would switch off if you dont move. It isnt that stinky, and there is a supermarket nearby so you get can snacks and stay in there. The wifi in there is bad though, but there is aircon so its not really warm. The cubicles are regular sized, and there is one handicap toilet on the ground floor, which i recommend if there are very little people in the bathroom, but don't clog it up because theres quite alot of old people. The sinks and clean as well. 4/5 for me because of the quotes on the door. It can really ruin my mood when reading angst because its too hopeful.",
