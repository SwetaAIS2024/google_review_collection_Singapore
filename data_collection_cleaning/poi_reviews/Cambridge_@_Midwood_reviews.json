      "text": "We've been to 3 other preschools before this and had/are still having the best experience at Cambridge @ Midwood so far. From day one, we felt welcomed into a family-like environment where every child is known and cared for as an individual. The owner-principal, teachers and staff are empathetic, inclusive, and warm in the way they connect with both children and parents.\n\nBeing new, the preschool has pristine facilities that are both safe and inviting, creating a lovely space for learning and play. What really stood out are the thoughtfully designed programmes with children at the heart of everything.\n\nItâ€™s clear the team here is passionate about nurturing not just academic growth, but emotional and social development too. We're so grateful to have found a place where our child is thriving, and we highly recommend it to any family looking for a warm, engaging, and supportive preschool environment.",
