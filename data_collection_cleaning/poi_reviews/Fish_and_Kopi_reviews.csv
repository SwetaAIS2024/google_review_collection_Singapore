Pecan Pie,1,"Ordered the large 8 dollars portion and the portions are pathetic, super tiny thin pieces of fish in the soup, not only do they give a tiny amount of fish they also cut it so thinly it all broke up into tiny pieces in the soup and this was for their large 8, I can’t imagine if it’s the 6 small. There’s no service but staff was friendly and place is air conditioned.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102778119224471464181/reviews
Di Di,5,"The cashier was very polite. It took me a while to order as it was my first time dining here. I am happy to find a place where I can have something healthy (fish soup with vegetable) and something sweet (peanut waffle). The soup was savoury and it helped to wash down the peanut from the waffle.

I reached at around 2pm which was after work. I have found a new quiet place to dine at and chill after work.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
T0 G0,4,"$7 for a medium sized decent fish soup. Good broth. Fresh Batang fish used. You must add +++$$ for more ingredients like egg bomb. Not the most generous with ingredients but since it is located inside an aircon mall, you pay for the aircon and exclusive shop space dedicated to only Fish Soup, coffee and tea and homemade waffles. The signature chilli Belacan is a hit and miss and rather stale as it is bubbly and watery, sitting in the tube container for the longest time. The red cut chilli is barely available and swimming in a tub of soya sauce and chilli seeds. The service is cut and dry, take it or leave it. The tables are also often dirty and not cleaned, so you have to DIY.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100748004489423574104/reviews

Eunice Chan,3,"Came here to test 1st before I bring my family here. Guess what? The change less 50cents when I receive from the worker. Secondly, the fish soup taste is just So-so not even worth for the price. You can get more delicious one outside. One time visit only no next time. Okay, bye.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112407509148361337304/reviews
