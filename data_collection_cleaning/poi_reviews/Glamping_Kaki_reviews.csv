Sally Yong,5,"We had a birthday surprise rather last minute. Glampingkaki made it a huge success!! Their response is very fast, helpful and clear. It was very easy to work with them despite that it was last minute. All along the way, messages and photos were sent via WhatsApp so I know what to do and what to expect. The tent and bedding were clean and spacious, at some point when it rained, it was still comfortable for everyone to stay in the tent. The fans which they provided spare batteries for kept the tent well ventilated, yes for sure it is rainproof. The birthday decor is pretty with balloons, fairy lights and banners. It was definitely worthwhile to add on tables and tools so dining was comfortable for everyone. I have already booked the next one to enjoy the experience. Kudos to Irene, William and team! Thanks for all the help.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106754293381398967669/reviews
