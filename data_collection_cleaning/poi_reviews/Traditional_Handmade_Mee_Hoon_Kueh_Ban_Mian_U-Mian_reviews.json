      "text": "This store is helmed by old couple for many years for morning breakfast till lunch. Recently it was helmed by 2 young chaps for evening session. Not sure if they are related to the old couple.\n\nAt first look, food appeal just goes down to zero. Its a case of cutting corners.\n\nGreens vegetables choy sum or xiao bai cai has been replaced with cheaper chinese cabbage, where the servings serves less than 1/2 leaf. Plus 2 slices of button mushroom.\n\nNoodle serving serves 4 mouthful, depending on the size of your spoon. Have to dig up just for photo shoot so it looks \"more\"!\n\nSoup seems like the most expensive ingredient, as i notice others getting even lesser than what you see in photo.\n\nAnd in the meantime, the 2 chaps were talking about the cost price of replacing the plastic takeaway containers.\n\nAt $4, 1 cannot expect too much but this is just way too low ball...\n\nAnd please, don't offer a $1 discount for google reviews. People are not pathetic to the extend to write a review for $1 discount of such food standard.",

      "text": "This stall, helmed by a friendly elderly couple, seems to operate at its own pace. My Monday late morning visit, supposedly an off-peak hour, resulted in a 20-minute wait for my order.\n\nHere, everything is made fresh upon order. I opted for the Mee Hoon Kueh with Dumplings ($5.20, with egg). Each bowl comes with a trio of dumplings, sliced shiitake and straw mushrooms,  shanghai green vegetable and a decent portion hand-torn mee hoon kueh.\n\nThe star of the show is the hand-torn mee hoon kueh itself. It boasts a chewy texture that complements the light and flavourful broth. The accompanying pork dumplings are equally unassuming, with a simple seasoning that lets the natural flavours shine.\n\nThe portion size might leave you wanting more, especially if you're famished.  This is a perfect option for a light lunch. Overall, I recommend this stall only if you have some time to spare and a hankering for a bowl ofmee hoon kueh.",
