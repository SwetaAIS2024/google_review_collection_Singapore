Beautiful pieces from all over Asia with exhibitions on rotation all the time. The owner Pino is incredibly friendly and lovely.\n\nMy favourite part is the collection of vintage kimonos and obis which are then repurposed into modern day pieces.\n\nA must see if you're in Tiong Bahru or Singapore!",

      "text": "This place is one of my favourite spots in Tiong Bahru! It is like a oasis of tranquility and beauty! Every month, the gallery would present an exhibition with a different Asian thematic, periodically you can admire Indian painting, sculptures from Myanmar, Tibetan rugs, Japanese kimonos or aborigenous art pieces from Australia. All pieces are authentic, some are very old, beautiful and all of high quality. In some ways the gallery resembles rather to a museum! The ambience in the gallery is very cozy with classical music in the background.\n\nWhen visiting the gallery you might be lucky to get to know Pino, the owner of the gallery; he is a very friendly and knowledgable person; you can feel how much passion he puts into the exhibition and how much he cares about each individual art piece that he personally collected in some remote place in Asia. It is lovely to listed the stories of the art pieces - somehow each one has a personal story :) You get a very warm feeling being there.\n\nI would highly recommend it to all art lovers visiting the neighbourhood! It is a very unique and truly inspiring place!",
