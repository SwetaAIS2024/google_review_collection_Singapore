Fadh 49,1,"NEVER EVER buy the $9.00 (NINE DOLLARS) packed beryani from this place!! I really felt cheated by the huge packet only to discovered that 90% of the content was rice, 9% bone (2 pcs of bones wrapped with rempah), 1% the rempah itself. The rest you imagine it yourself of the frustration upon the discovery. Can we call this business as halal?? Idk. WallaHu a'lam bissawab.
