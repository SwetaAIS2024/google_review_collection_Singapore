Eventually I got the table. After receiving my drink in 10mins, which was fast considering they were busy. After 15mins or some I was asked if I was leaving soon bcos the person on the call said I will be staying for only 30mins. Like why would anyone stay for 30mins only at the place where live band was playing. After consideration, they asked if I would like to share table instead, in my mind it was bad already. Nevertheless, music was good just this miscommunication made the experience very bad.",

The chicken herbal soup was absolutely SPOT ON, bursting with robust flavours that go so well with a bowl of rice.\n\nThe staff and owners are welcoming, making this place feels so much more than just a place to have food and drinks. It truly feels like coming home to a safe place.\n\nWill definitely return to try their ever-changing seasonal menu!",
