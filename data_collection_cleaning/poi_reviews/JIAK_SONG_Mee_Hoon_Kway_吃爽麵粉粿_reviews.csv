E L,4,"I ordered number 1 signature, dry ban mian with minced pork, pork ball, pork slices and prawn ball. The unique flavour is the sauce, having a distinct heavy smokey taste. It's quite flavourful. Noodles are also tasty and texture is good. They use a small machine to run through the noodles or to cut it ? Not very sure. For dry version, they put the egg in the small soup bowl. Egg is watery and half cooked. The portion is not alot. Overall it's decent and can be better foe the price and branding.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103652341917602520718/reviews
Jialeng Lee,4,"The noodles at the hawker stall were a delightful surprise. The soup base was rich and flavorful, with a comforting depth that felt both nourishing and satisfying. What really stood out, though, was the unmistakable ""wok hei"". The noodles themselves were perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of chewiness to complement the savory broth. A great, affordable option for those craving a satisfying noodle dish with that authentic smoky kick.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106651375996354389379/reviews

Jason Goh,3,"I have been a regular patron of this Mee Hoon Kuay at Yishun Block 470B.

But I’m utterly disappointed and disgusted by the stall handler last week.

Firstly, the stall had a lot of houseflies and when he’s done, he had his thumb in the soup when pass to me.

I confronted him and but he instead apologise, he shouted back at me and mention he’s didn’t and he used his the other hand with glove.

Even if he did use the hand with glove, the glove was not change while preparing raw food.

I confronted him but he just replied, I’m just a worker, take it or leave it.

This is totally unacceptable and we will not patron again especially with such bad attitude and hygiene.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116328721891596281771/reviews
Darren,4,"A farily popular store at this food centre, and for good reason. Their dry noodles come in a very unique sauce that has a distinct smokey character to it - no where else have I tasted noodles like this before! The noodles themselves are chewy and has a nice bite, and the chilli has a spicy-sour kick that overall just gives this dish much more oomph. Their soup is also not your average run-of-the-mill soup either, it's almost like egg drop soup here. And best of all, all this for just $4.50...woo!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews
