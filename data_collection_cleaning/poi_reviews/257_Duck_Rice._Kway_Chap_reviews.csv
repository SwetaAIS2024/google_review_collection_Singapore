Jason Lee,4,"One of our Favourite Kway Chap in Bukit Panjang. Stall Aunties are always friendly. Love all the ingredients in the Kway Chap and ordered extra tao pok for my wife. The Braised sauce/gravy is rich & savory. Tje Kuay is cooked just nice! The portion we ordered for 2pax cost $12.

My wife finds it will be perfect if it is garnish with some coriander leaves.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117371894884760957562/reviews
ah siao,4,"At $3.50 for duck kuay teow, the portion is big.
Duck is soft and tender, but sufficiently braised- so not salty enough for me.
Kuay teow is thin and nice.
Chilli is not really spicy.
Soup has a little herbal taste.
All in good and price worthy - only if you are around the corner.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117122252684175285400/reviews

Kia Guan Ng,3,"It’s reasonably priced at $3.50 for the kway chap. It comes with a generous bowl of kway. The intestines, dou pok and two halves of an egg were not soaked in the lor sauce long enough as the colour was slightly dark. On the other hand, it’s “healthier” as it is not that salty if you soak it long. Personally I prefer the darker shade.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108972979221461010763/reviews
