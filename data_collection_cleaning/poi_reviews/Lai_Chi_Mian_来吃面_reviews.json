I was the only customer there\n\nNot once, but many times, he had shown no patience for listening to orders as mine had few big ones sometimes and then got the orders wrong\n\nLast point, he‚Äôs a terrible cook as well. Ordered dry noodles, he still cooked them it‚Äôs like soup noodles, I might as well ordered soup variation in the first place? Where got people filled the vinegar and chill sauce almost to the brim? The noodles were so soggy!\n\nDon‚Äôt even know why is he even hired üòí not the first time seeing customers leaving unfinished bowls behind and bad ratings on food delivery platforms. The shorter guy in the day cooked better",
