The ladies who work here are always nice to me and know my order before I even say it. I can easily customise it by removing pork and ikan bilis (deep fried anchovies) from my food and they will add more vegetables for me instead. I do see familiar faces / regulars at the shop.",

      "text": "I was very curious about this restaurant right after I saw reviews on google maps. Because people who gave 1 star mentioned about how bad the service is. Since I don't care much about services so I decided to visit here.\n\nI'm Korean and I feel really hard to adapt to food of Singapore since I came here two days ago. La mian in here was the best food I've ever experienced in this country. It was delicious!!! Taste of XLB was soso. If this restaurant is located in my hometown, I'd like to visit here every week.\n\nFacial expression of the staff made me scared but nothing happened. Maybe some people can think her as a rude person. It was okay to me.",
