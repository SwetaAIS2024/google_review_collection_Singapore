Flo Yeow,3,"It's the first bus stop into the Tiong Bahru area. It's near a number of seafood restaurants and the Link Hotel across the road. But that said, there's no shelter towards anywhere, and that could be a problem. You'd still need to bring your umbrella if you're travelling anywhere. It's a large enough bus stop to hide from the rain though.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
