BR Wong,5,"I came here because of issues with my mobile app , the reception was manned by YouRi , I waited really long for a counter to help me. YouRi came to check on me and enquired about the problem knowing I waited a long time, she took the initiative to call IT who recommended some steps to resolve the issue. I was really impressed by her proactive and going another mile attitude which can be lacking in most receptionist.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105906034575547265267/reviews
Cassey Lienda,1,"What bad service. I came from the East Coast area to collect a red packet from the counter. I just needed to mention the UOB officer's name and finish the process. However, the UOB staff named Anabelle made it difficult and wasted my time. I already said the UOB officer's name so I could collect the red packet, but she insisted she didn’t know the person. I asked if she was new, but she wasn’t. I had to go to another location to meet a different UOB officer. Because of this, I no longer feel like visiting that branch again. What’s the point of hiring her if she can’t do her job and help customers? I also heard this is not her first time doing this.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114609534641171096551/reviews
H M,1,"As a privilege banking customer, I was assisted by Ro Yuri --she's really the worst. I never had a bad experience at uob orchard but this time was the worst. She's very unhelpful. If you happen to get her counter, please do skip it and wait for another!!*uob please look into this particular staff",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107650049285627198195/reviews

Thanks to Ms Valerie Chin that I had a wonderful time with my family at the wellness event.

She is indeed very attentive and efficient in her duties.

Hope to attend more of such informative events on wellness.

Thank you.

Best,

Heidi Yu,1,They should remove Hong Kong as an issuing country of passports. The bank has changed it to China for Hong Kong passport holders in the backend but failed to remove Hong Kong as an option from their forms. So I had to go to the branch to submit the form. When I gave the feedback of removing the option of Hong Kong from the form the staff seemed to have difficulty understanding the rationale (they thought that there was another “non-China” Hong Kong passport). I hope this is fixed and no other customer has to waste time going to the branch.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106788954695940919206/reviews
