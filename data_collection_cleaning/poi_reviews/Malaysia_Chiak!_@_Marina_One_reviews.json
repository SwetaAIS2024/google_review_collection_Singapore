Staff took such a long time to brew the drinks, resulting in few people queueing.\n\nVisited on 16 June 2023. Ordered the Chicken Cutlet Curry Rice and Teh C. For the curry rice, the chicken meat was tough as it might be cooked a while ago before being displayed. For the drink, observed that the staff took longer than it normally would to prepare drinks, thus resulting in a longer wait than necessary.",

Few variety including kuew tiaw, chicken curry rice, minc meat noodle and beverage. Too bad no more chendol stall. Reasonable food price between $4-8. Straight forward service from staff, but I came here for food not for the service. Would be great if they can expand the space for more seat available. Recommended!",
