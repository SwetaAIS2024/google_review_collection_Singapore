      "text": "Tried this new lor mee stall on GrabFood, and I must say, it was really good! The broth was rich and flavorful, not too thick or watery‚Äîjust the right consistency. The ingredients were fresh, especially the fish flakes, which were in big chunks and added a nice texture to the dish.\n\nThe only downside was the packaging. I ordered the big size, but the container seemed a bit too small. A larger bowl would be better so there‚Äôs more space for the sauce, which would make the dish even more enjoyable.\n\nOverall, a satisfying bowl of lor mee. Will definitely order again!",

Was very excited to find a Lor Mee store in this newly opened Bukit Batok West Hawker Centre. Lucky I came earlier, there was a long queue and they sold out shortly after I finished my meal.\n\nHighly recommend you to try! 10/10.",

      "text": "My initial choice was closed and I decided to try this stall with zero expectations. While there were some positive reviews, there weren't any customer on my day of visit (PH, late afternoon), perhaps because lor mee is typically enjoyed early in the day. Thankfully, it turned out better than expected. Firstly, the standard portion of their signature bowl ($5.50) was generous for the price, loaded with fried fish, shredded braised pork (it could be chicken, it was hard to discern), egg, and fried yam fritter. The condiment station was free-flowing ingredients, a definite bonus if you enjoy a generous amount of vinegar and chilli with your lor mee. Plus, their minced garlic was very fine and blended well with the lor mee.\nI took a star off because I felt they could have been more generous with the gravy. While it was quite flavourful with herbal notes, the gravy leaned towards a gluey consistency, which might have been due to the time of my visit. I thought a slightly wetter gravy would have mixed better with the condiments.\n\nNevertheless, I think the price is fair for the quality and definitely worth trying if you are in the area.",

My qualm? Price point and a cheaper and nicer lor mee down the road.\n\nI have a question: Are they related to Jue Jia Lor Mee at Woodleigh Village HC? I'm 80% certain of this.",
