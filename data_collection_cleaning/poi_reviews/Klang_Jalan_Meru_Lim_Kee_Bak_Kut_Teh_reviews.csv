Marcus Nah,3,"Had a earlier dinnertime there at 5pm on weekday.. not crowded. Serving was pretty fast.

Taste of BKT very normal.. for their soup and also dried BKT. The YTF also so so. The salty veg taste appetizing.. crunchy a little sweetness. Served in slightly big pieces..

$50+ for 3pax",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108851483842225070997/reviews

Goh Meng Seng,4,"Bakut Teh Series

Bakut Teh (Pork Ribs Soup) & Braised Pig Trotters (滷豬腳）are two of my favourite SG dishes.

Apart from those ""famous"" restaurants (some are seriously over rated) selling these two dishes (yes, most of the time these two dishes are sold together in the same food outlets), I am always interested to try out other stalls in hawker centers and coffeeshops.

This particular stall caught my eyes after my morning walk. I decided to try it out.

It claims to be the ONLY AUTHENTIC Klang Bakut Teh! But I don't know how Klang Bakut Teh tastes like.

Anyway, I ordered 1 claypot of pork ribs. Guess how much it costs?

I was surprised that the boss asked me to go back to my seat and wait, he will serve my food shortly! Wah, that's really old style! No need self service, no need to wait for number calling nor take an electronic token... Whatever!

I was even more surprised when the boss serve my Bakut Teh! It's not the typical coffeeshop or hawker center style but the two different fried bean curds (tou pok you kua) were served separately!

The pork rib soup was serve with much pride, with tou kee properly covered over the soup.

What's left is the taste test.

It surprised me again as it didn't have the usual overdosage of pepper or garlic. The soup was tasty and smooth!

The only imperfection is that the meat on the pork ribs wasn't tender enough.

To achieve tenderness in pork ribs or pig trotters, these must be cooked for a prolonged period with simmer fire. This is one area that the stall could improve on and that would make the whole dish PERFECT!

On the other hand, the coffeeshop's coffee taste really mediocre!

If only I could finish off my Bakut Teh with my Akbar Premium Orient Mystery Jasmine Rose tea, that would make the whole experience heavenly wholesome!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114198156795244911848/reviews
Aik Peng Ng,2,"There was no price displayed so be careful what you order.  Do ask for price before ordering.  The bowl of curry pork ribs cost $8 with quite generous portion.

Had this curry pork rib and it tasted delicious.  The gravy was fantastic and the ribs were very tendered and soft.  The issue is the flavour was not absorbed into the rib so I believe the ribs were not soaked long enough in the curry sauce.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113242941318889107118/reviews
Chee How,5,"Generous portion and affordable price, good quality meat chosen, perfectly cooked rice. The soup uses lightened ingredients, yet it doesn't sacrifice the classic flavour. Highly recommended place.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112572449343521813536/reviews
