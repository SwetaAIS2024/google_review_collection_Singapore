melvyn lau,5,"Their noodle dishes are unbeatable.
Wok hey is good, fire is controlled well.
Taste is good, not thirsty after eating.
Not too salty, not too sweet, they managed to find a balance.
Special mention: Singapore bee hoon (known as sin chew bee hoon/ sin chou mi fen)

Food is cheap at very generous portions for their rice and noodle dishes. I don't think this can be found anywhere else today.

Service is good. Friendly and helpful staff.
