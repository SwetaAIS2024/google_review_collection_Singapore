Amanda Kim Woo,5,"Dr. Choo and her crew took excellent care of me during my second pregnancy from start to the birth of my child. It was my first pregnancy abroad (moved from the states to Singapore) so it really helped a lot to have a doctor who was as wonderful as Dr. Choo.

Dr. Choo has great bedside manner and is very detailed, delightful to be with, attentive and genuinely cares for her patients.

The staffs are absolutely amazing! They are so funny (makes me look forward to the visits!), remembers you by names from day 1 and most importantly VERY responsive (via email, phone or in person) which I find are all so important when this is a 10 months journey to take together.

I highly recommend Dr. Choo and her staffs in a heartbeat.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109486181920156746175/reviews
Shu Run Goh,5,"Dr. Choo and team were amazing throughout my first pregnancy. They were reassuring with all the concerns i had, especially when i had to be admitted to hospital at the start of my 3rd trimester.

During the delivery, it was a long almost 17hour labour and again we felt very comforted and guided through our decisions at various junctures, all the way through a successful natural birth.

We cannot be more thankful for Dr. Choo and team throughout this whole journey!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114965546412542948078/reviews
