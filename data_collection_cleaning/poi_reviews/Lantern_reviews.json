      "text": "I had the pleasure of being served by Asel, and I must say—she was truly exceptional. She was polite, attentive, and incredibly helpful in answering all our questions. I’ve dined at several fine dining establishments, and Asel stands out as the best waitress I’ve ever encountered.\n\nWhat really impressed me was her thoughtful approach when we asked for a couple photo. Not only was she happy to help, but she also put genuine effort into finding the perfect angle. We even showed her an example of the kind of photo we wanted, and to our surprise, she captured it almost identically. I was both shocked and delighted by her attention to detail and care.\n\nAsel truly sets the bar for what excellent service should be—she is the perfect example of professionalism, warmth, and genuine hospitality. Because of her, I’ll definitely be returning to Lantern at Fullerton Bay. She made our experience unforgettable.\n\nAs for the food, here’s what we ordered for two pax:\n\nWagyu Beef Short Rib – 10/10\nAbsolutely amazing. The meat was incredibly tender and flavorful—this is a must-try! The portion was generous and beautifully presented with a large rib bone. The accompanying tortilla was unique and delicious, unlike any we’ve had elsewhere. Highly recommend.\n\nMini Wagyu Beef Sliders – 7/10\nNot bad at all. The beef was medium rare, juicy, and tender. A decent option if you're craving something more casual.\n\nEggplant Bruschetta – 8.5/10\nTasty and well-seasoned, though I was surprised there wasn’t any visible eggplant. Still enjoyable and worth trying.\n\nMongolian Spiced Kebab (Plant-Based) – 6/10\nFlavor-wise it was okay, but I didn’t really enjoy the sauce that came with it. However, it actually tasted much better when paired with the mustard sauce from the short rib.\nSpeaking of which...\n\nMustard Sauce (from the Wagyu Short Rib) – 10/10\nThis sauce was insanely good! Smoky, chargrilled, rich, and flavorful—I couldn’t get enough of it. It elevated everything we dipped into it.",
