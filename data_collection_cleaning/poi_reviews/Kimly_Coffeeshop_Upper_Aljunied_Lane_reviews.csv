kevin yee,2,"A typical neighbourhood coffee shop. But they have a major problem - birds. You can see birds everywhere and the birds aren’t afraid of humans. With most people returning their trays, the tray return station became the birds favourite hang out.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106037688957556230667/reviews
LINDA Teo,4,"I’m reviewing Wei Jia only. Despite busy lunch hours, they never do slipshod work. All items are freshly cooked/ fried. I eat spinach soup everyday. Top up small amount of money for more ingredients since I don’t take carbs. Thumbs up for small business like them.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110369646278636149753/reviews

Ting,1,"Fish soup stall should just remove their grab payment. Their mobile data signal is weak, even when I showed them I paid and transaction is successful on my app. They refuse to make my food cause their app has no signal and thus, did not receive the payments. They made me wait for 10 min, without telling me that they are not going to give me my food. Complete waste of time, extremely terrible service.

Ask me to come back next day to check and take my food if the transaction is successful at their end. I don’t even stay in this area! Terrible service.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113683209841359141103/reviews
