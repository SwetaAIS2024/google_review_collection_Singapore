Very considerate.\n\nMostly deserted except during peak hours. No queues at ATMs, topping up stations - and clean restrooms.\n\nConveniently located next to the historical Haw Par Villa.\n\nHuge crowds used to throng it for its Chinese mythological figurines and depiction of \"hell\" punishment chambers. But alas, not anymore - even after reverting back to free admission.\n\nGuess times have changed. Singapore have changed. Values have changed as well.",
