Martin,5,"If I could give this place an extra star, I absolutely would. The experience was a perfect example of how looks can be deceiving. Take the menu item ""Like a Virgin""—what appears subtle at first delivers a punch that hits the back of your tongue with hint of spiciness, awakening your palate. Then there's ""Sweet Dreams,"" a seemingly innocent lobster dish that, once tasted, bursts with the unexpected flavor of seafood paella. I was genuinely blown away by how the flavors completely defied my expectations and played tricks on my senses. The entire experience was incredibly comfortable and enjoyable. Huge kudos to the team for making this dinner truly gastronomical. The service was exceptional, the flavours unforgettable, and the nostalgic backdrop music made the evening even more memorable.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103980397671113453881/reviews
Waldo //,5,"Clearly my photos don't do justice to the food, but it was an 11/10 experience. I was pleasantly surprised with each course. I especially loved the caviar (first course and it blew me away already), refreshing somen, and the juicy, sweet muskmelon. Lovely service by the team as well

It's the perfect restaurant to come with a date because of the Japanese food, nice intimate ambience and jams (amazing song choices btw). This place is definitely a hidden gem, worth going for sure. I guess it's not a surprise because Shoukouwa shinjidai is a collab between Saint Pierre and Shoukouwa! Both well-known with two michelin stars each",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116140695123233673060/reviews
Angel Tan,5,"Was scrolling the list of restaurants on the Singapore Restaurants Week website one day and discovered that @shoukouwa and @saintpierresg had collaborated and opened @shoukouwa_shinjidai last year. Since both are Two-Michelin Starred chefs, I was pretty excited about the meal yet pretty surprised on how easy it was to get a reservation.

Verdict? The food was really fantastic (I can’t even decide what my favourite item was), and service was also top-notch. The chef also gave us a complimentary upgrade and served us an additional slice of musk melon each 🥲 Prices are steep, but you’re paying for what you get. Recommend!

Mr J,5,"It’s been a few months since my last visit but I just had to leave a review. Amazing experience at this restaurant, I was not expecting such good quality Japanese food. Food presentation is unique and the ingredients were all very very fresh. It’s nice that it’s an intimate space, you get to chat with the chefs behind the counter to understand more about what you’re having. I had the Yume menu for dinner and it was just too good. Definitely great for celebrations or to treat your family to a good meal. Service was impeccable as well. Knowledgable on sake. Thanks Chefs and the team for this 5-star experience. It’s a wonder how other places got their Michelin stars and this place didn’t. Long story short, you’ve got to try this at least once. You’ll understand my review after 🙂‍↕️",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100883726585429159362/reviews
Zen Cheng,5,"Do not hesitate further!! This place is a hidden gem in central district of orchard. Food is excellent. Very fresh and creative (80% Japanese with 20% French influence from Saint Pierre). We tried the $380++ menu with 12 courses.  I was blown away by the first course which is made up of 2 types of caviar. The subsequent courses are excellent too. Service from the chefs and wait staff are personable, knowledgeable and attentive which elevates the dining experience. The lady sommelier is very knowledgeable and knows her sake. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone! And I will be back too! Wonderful dining experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117665310679836496573/reviews
