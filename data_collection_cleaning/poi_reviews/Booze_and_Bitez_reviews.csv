Kannan Kumar,5,"One of our favourite joints to chill when we want to bite into some awesomely good Indian fusion food and delicacies. Service is excellent. It's run by two experienced owners who has been in the F&B industry for over 2 decades. Always innovating new or revamping existing dishes.
Thier mutton keema pizza is signature item. The commando is highly addictive. Food was so good we forgot to take pictures. Check it out folks.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105804640518443851143/reviews

Mad D (best and excellent),5,"This booze&bites is a new Indian fusion dish in punggol.
Two glasses of beer are 21 dollars. I ordered the mutton pizza recommended by the boss, which is full of spices.

Then a regular French fries.
The boss is very nice. I asked him to get the ice cubes.
He gave me a small bucket of ice cubes. According to Singapore, a glass of water would not be provided for free.
I thought it would be charged, but it turned out that there was no place.
It surprised me!
In this way, a meal by the seaside is 47sgd, and there is no service fee or tax.
It is excellent.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100528823118594341349/reviews
Angela Chong,5,"A casual place to chill with family and friends and watch the world go by. Its breezy along the terrace, cosy and intimate indoors. Food is delicious and perfect for sharing. We had the lamb kheema pizza, lamb chops and commando fries. The mojito is a perfect accompaniment to wash down the fiery spicy flavours. The service is attentive and friendly.
Will definitely return for moreüòã",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106182215167408819125/reviews
