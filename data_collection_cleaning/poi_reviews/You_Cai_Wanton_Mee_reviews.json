For a large size I got 6 huge dumplings, each with flavorful minced pork and a whole prawn. Noodles were also springy (quite spicy though), vegetables were not bitter and still had some crunch to them. Highly recommended!",

The dumplings offer an upgrade with water chestnuts and a shrimp, seems like these were just wrapped in the regular pork fillings without being actually mixed in so the flavors don't really gel. Minor issue. Char siew was typical cardboard like. Still an above average wanton noodle.",

The only savior (reason for 2 star instead of 1) will be their dumpling which is good and full of meat. When eaten feels like  having Siew Mai in a softer version.\n\nIf you are going just for wanton noodle, do avoid.",
