Hartono Harjono,5,"Located opposite the food court on level 2 of Loyang Point, this store is a one-stop extravaganza for any drink you can imagine. The juices are awesome with reasonable prices, and the Thai coconut drink was particularly great. The service was amazing. Highly recommended!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102944719141464210600/reviews
- ‚Äú‚Ä™dustandtumbleweed‚Ä¨‚Äù -,5,"Really cute place at the second floor of Loyang Point, just facing the food court near Singapore Pools. Ordered the Strawberry Banana Yoghurt smoothie‚Äîit‚Äôs creamy and sweet (I might ask if it‚Äôs possible to reduce the sugar level next time), and so reasonably priced at $5 a cup. Pleasant server too. Will be back to try other items on the menu, like Green Tea Latte and Signature Milk Tea. üç°",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112209089308727695057/reviews
Barbette Strauss,5,"I love having a private moment eating ice cream, topped up with fruits & fruit juices!  Service is excellent when customers get served delicious, yummy desserts with a bright smile on a forward looking staff‚Äôs face.  Tried their coconut ice-cream the first time & that got me returning back to the stall for more - today I tried the mango ice-cream, topped up with honey dew & mango flavoured pearls & my favourite dragon fruit drink!  Yummy!! Enjoyed it to bits!!! Highly recommended place to chill out & have some juices for the health conscious & ice cream if u can spare having some extra calories in your diet like I did! üòã",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116995110127835257886/reviews

Xueling Xie,5,"It's my go-to juice and fruits shop when I am around Loyang. Their juice and fruits are priced at very reasonable prices. The ladyboss is also very hospitable and friendly. An example is I ordered an avocado coconut shake and it is at a very good value of $5 (it really is a large cup made from one whole coconut where she scoops out all the flesh for us and a lot of avocado), and a large papaya slice at a price of $1 (which really is a good price). I really love this place and on top of it, the ladyboss is really nice and makes my stay a very pleasant one.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110092935356750382097/reviews
