Daisy daisy,1,"Very strange shop, no service, 2 or 3 cashiers just chit chat sth and laugh loudly, even customer need assistant, there's no concern received. The transaction process is not smooth, one cashier is blur and another cashier is overreacted emotionally. Anyway, just bought gift for friend and moved. Overall, it is an uncomfortable shopping experience.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118414424590636043815/reviews

The item I needed was not available but she checked with other stores, found one, took the trouble to collect and transfer it to her outlet (as it was most convenient for me) so I could it. Well done!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108580195154738504895/reviews
