Yi Ling,4,"Situated at Shuttle Station 2, the little kiosk sells Ben & Jerry Ice Cream scoops, slushies, and snacks. Some souvenirs are sold here as well as some snacks. I like that the old trams design was used to recreate the table and chairs. It's quite cute , caters only maybe 2 families with its limited seats only.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115707001285123682601/reviews
