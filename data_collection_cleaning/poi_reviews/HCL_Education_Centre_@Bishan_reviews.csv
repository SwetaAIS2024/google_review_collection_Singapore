Tao,5,"Dear Teacher Vicky,

I am writing to sincerely thank you for the outstanding guidance and support you have provided Ivy in her English learning. Your expertise, patience, and dedication are truly commendable.

What we particularly appreciate is your systematic approach to teaching. Before exams, you thoroughly review all essential grammar topics that frequently appear in tests, ensuring Ivy has a solid grasp of key concepts. Moreover, you carefully analyze her performance in practice tests and tailor your instruction to address recurring weaknesses, which has been incredibly helpful in strengthening her skills.

Beyond academics, your warm and encouraging teaching style has made Ivy genuinely enjoy her English lessons. She always looks forward to your classes and has gained remarkable confidence under your guidance.

Thank you for being such an inspiring and responsible teacher. We feel very fortunate to have you in Ivy's learning journey.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106321511788494795425/reviews
Rachel LAI,5,Chang laoshi is an excellent teacher who showed tremendous patience to my son who had speech delay. She even went to extra mile when my son missed 1 lesson and couldn't do makeup lesson in time. She would offer an extra 10minutes to go through the lesson work he had missed. My son could understand her teaching very well. Weekly updates of what is being taught in class are helpful and helped in home reinforcement.
