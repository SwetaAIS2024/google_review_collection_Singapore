      "text": "L\nI recently dined at A Kitchen and it was a delightful experience! The atmosphere was spacious and inviting, perfect for a relaxed meal. However, the loud karaoke was a bit distracting for my taste.\n\nThe service was a bit slow, likely because some waitresses were busy preparing food, but they were friendly and attentive when they could be.\n\nNow, onto the food‚Äîeverything was freshly cooked and delicious! One of the standout dishes was the BBQ skewers; they were nicely spiced and incredibly affordable $1/stick. We also tried a few other dishes, which were slightly on the salty and oily side but paired well with rice.\n\nOverall, the prices were reasonable, and I left satisfied. I would definitely visit again for the great food and ambiance (minus the karaoke)!",

Visited this place on a Sunday for dinner, service was awful due to the crowd, understandable but it could be better. The restaurant is well decorated, which is a plus.\n\nWould definitely recommend this place for gathering but it won‚Äôt be my top picks for sure.",

      "text": "Colleague recommended trying the place due to their affordable Chuan Chuan ($1), and I will say it did not disappoint! The chicken is really tender, and the beef also had a nice texture to it! Both were really well seasoned and tasty. Do note that there is a minimum order of 3 for each type.\n\nThe food can be a bit oily though. For example, the ‚Äúpotato in tin foil‚Äù is cooked completely in oil, but it was still a nice dish to try. The potato frels like it melts in your mouth, and explodes with the oily flavour. Which makes it pretty addictive to eat.\n\nRestaurant is mostly self service. Orders are done by scanning a QR code, and even the drinks are self service.\n\nLike most Chinese restaurants, do come here with a larger group of people. Most of the food comes in large sharing portions.",
