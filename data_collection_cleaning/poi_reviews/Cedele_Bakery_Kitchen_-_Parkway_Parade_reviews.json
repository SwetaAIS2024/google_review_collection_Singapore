Instead of just having sandwiches, how about trying the dishes at Cedele.\n\nService can be slow and expect some waiting time. The food is delicious and there is a range of healthy dishes to choose from.\n\nMost of the mains are designed to be a protein paired brilliantly with grains or pasta.  There’s always space for cakes and Cedele is officially the best place for it.",

We ordered a Christmas salmon dish, and I was totally taken aback when the food was served ! It looked like some left over food from my mum’s kitchen ! The salmon was a thin piece n the plating was unpleasant n to think that I have to pay $28 for it ! appalled !\n\nThe other dish of chic n prawns quinoa was bland n the prawns were so tiny !\n\nThe cook must be overworked n tired to churn out sub par food !\n\nCedele  seriously you need to improve !",

The one who serve our food can serve without cutleries. My order was waited long enough about 25 mins that I thought they forgotten about my order. The person who’s making my drink, upon hearing my order, were confused as she needed to ask her colleague about the make of my drink, which was in their menu. The whole experience was bad for me.",

Score 9/10.\n\nPortobello Garlic Toss scored 10/10 ⭐️👍🏼\n\nBacon Beef Burger on Walnut Bun toasted was actually good however a tad too sweet from caramelized onions. The presentation of the salad & fried sweet potatoes was excellent. Overal 8.5/10 👌🏼 May order again but perhaps request less of the caramelized onion which juices was dripping when eating burger. Patty was good.\n\nIced Rooibos Lemon Tea is not bad. Glass a bit small small for the price. Scored 8/10 👍🏼 will order again if craving for the ‘exotic’ flavour.\n\n==============================\n\nThird visit was Sunday, April 18th, 2021.\n\nThe Hearty Breakfast was below expectation only because the eggs “over easy” was done “over hard”. Apparently, in Asia the term “over easy” is not understood that “over easy” is to flip the sunny side up eggs for 5 to 7 seconds to set the egg white while the egg yolk is left runny.  Also the sour dough bread was too hard. Maybe toasted to long. Keeping rating to 4 star for now.\n\nThe Hearty Breakfast all day brunch rated 6/10.\n\nThere are 4 other orders from picture no. 10 to 13 with ratings.\n\n==============================\n\nSecond visit was on Friday, April 2nd, 2021.\nPicture no. 4 onwards.\nPortobello mushroom quinoa 9/10👍🏼\nTofu Furikake Salad 7/10\nGrilled Garlic Chicken 8.5/10\nLoaded Caesar Salad 9/10 👍🏼\nSpinach Lentil & Grill vegan burger 6/10\n- walnut bun 👍🏼\n- sweet potato fries as expected was 👍🏼however quantity was apparently less during this visit.\n\n==============================\n\nFirst visit was Sunday, March 25th, 2021. Picture no. 1 to no. 3.\n\nPrawn Salad 9/10 👍🏼\nVegan beet root burger 9/10 👍🏼\n- walnut bread was 👍🏼😃\n- sweet potato fries 👍🏼⭐️",
