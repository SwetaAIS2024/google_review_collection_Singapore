JANET LIM,1,"The Class A ward is under-staff. It is about only 2-3 nurses attending to 14 beds
Thus, the service level is affected. For people paying higher price (class A), we will expect prompt service.
On 25 Apr 25 (fri), ward 17G, no OT or PT session was arranged and i was given the explanation that they are lack resource so they can only see patient only 2 times each week. Hence, this would mean there will be 1 day that the patient has no therapy at all and it was a waste of rehab time! Please look into this feedback and provide an explanation. This is  totally unacceptable as the patient is here to do rehab for recovery and yet she is now sleeping whole day due to the lack of resource.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112347716612686090737/reviews
Lee Ml,5,"Doctors/staff/social worker and nurses are great people.
To begin, nephew had severe stroke on 23 Jan 2025 (right side of his body). He admitted to TTSH and subsequently to ICH (level 7G) for rehab. We are given extension for nephew stay until 18 Apr 2025 (they heard us while sharing our worries). Doctors and all staff helped with the process of nephew recovery. To us, we are thankful since he can now move around without having long term helper.
We are grateful to TTSH and TTSH ICH (Integrated Care Hub).
Thank you very much üòäüôèüëçüèª",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115771800503604258399/reviews

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Mr. Teo Zhe Hao and Ms. Charmaine Leow of Level 15 Rehabilitation Group for their outstanding care and dedication. Their professionalism and compassion in guiding my dad through his rehabilitation journey were truly exemplary. They took the time to understand his needs, tailored the therapy to suit his condition, and consistently encouraged him with positivity. Their ability to combine expert knowledge with a warm, patient-centered approach made a significant difference in his recovery. I am incredibly thankful for their commitment and personal attention, which went above and beyond expectations. Their teamwork, patience, and attention to detail reflect the highest standards of care, and my dad feel fortunate to have been under their guidance. Kudos to this exceptional duo for making his rehabilitation a truly uplifting experience!

A heartfelt thank you to Staff Nurse Miss Nang of Ward 15H for her exceptional professionalism and compassionate care. From the moment my dad was admitted, she displayed remarkable attentiveness, ensuring all his needs were met promptly. Her ability to communicate with clarity and kindness made a huge difference, putting him at ease during his stay. She consistently went above and beyond, providing not just medical care but also emotional support. Her dedication and tireless efforts are a true asset to the team, and I deeply appreciate all that she has done!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105524133033629488922/reviews
