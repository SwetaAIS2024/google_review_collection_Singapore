Pankaj Prasad,5,"One of the youngest universities in Singapore has already been ranked among the top 100 universities in the world. It was inaugurated in collaboration with MIT, the USA. This modern University is famous for its research on robotics, future cities, intelligent cities, and 5G, among others. There is a vast library, world-class sports facilities, cafes, restaurants, and hostel facilities.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105766923737178226846/reviews

Fikri J,5,"Very interesting university with cool architecture and state-of-the-art equipment scattered across the campus. There‚Äôs an automated bubble tea machine and Amazon Go like shop here too.

As someone who is not studying here and only came over as a visitor for a convention/talk at the auditorium, I was quite impressed. The seminar rooms are also pretty nice and conducive too. Signboards make it easy to navigate around the building.

The campus is directly linked to the MRT station (Upper Changi Stn) via 2 underground exits (I think; don‚Äôt have to worry about getting wet on rainy days) as well as a bus stop right outside the main road which easily links you to the Expo, Tanah Merah, Bedok, or Tampines, Changi Airport (opposite direction).

It would be awesome to be a student here in this university located in the eastern part of Singapore if you‚Äôre living or staying in the east as most university campuses are located in the western part of SG.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115734785798057148033/reviews
Jonavan Lee,5,"Beautiful campus! Visited this place because Hope Church Singapore had a laser tag event at their Sports Hall 2. Very green campus with lots of trees, much like my alma mater NTU.
