Zozo,5,"If you’re looking for a place to hang out, eat, and have a blast with friends Bu Er Bu Zuo  is where you want to be! This alfresco dining spot is the perfect place to kick back, relax, and dive into some seriously delicious Chinese cuisine.

From sizzling grilled skewers to comforting hotpot and mouth-watering stir-fried! The grilled skewers? Oh, they’re a showstopper! With a wide range of ingredients to choose from, and the option of spicy or non-spicy.

And let’s talk about the Clam with Pig Stomach Hot Pot – it’s a bowl of pure comfort. The broth is so rich and flavorful, it’s like a warm hug for your soul. Pair it with fresh ingredients like having steamboat.

the stir-fried dishes – they are just as impressive.

The best part? The service is top-notch! The staff is super friendly and attentive.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109173464175521287422/reviews
William Lu,3,"It wasn't as crowded as last time I visited. I came on Sunday night and it was quite empty. Easily to get a seat and eat here. The place is quite hidden, you would see a lot restaurants in the front with small pathway to here because of big indoor sport covered it from the front. Maybe because of this as well, cause I couldn't find the place when I visited here.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
r2 d2,4,Tasted good very near to Siamese taste. A bit disappointed on the fried crispy pork which turn out to be fried Chinese style roasted pork. Thought was the thin crispy pork. Pad Thai is very appetizing. Waiting time is way too long for each individual dishes. Milk tea is super sweet. Recommend wearing long pants or apply mosquito repellent to avoid “intimate kiss” by mosquitoes.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102563355985003846010/reviews
