I have no idea why the Paylah account was still working that I cannot login my account in case of my DBS account had been closed. Does your bank have any logic to allow the account running but donot provide the access to the customer? Otherwise, there is no option in your app to close the Paylah! account and DBS online bank had so many bugs before. Really disappointed with your banking system which I never contacted in any other countries before.",

      "text": "Unfriendly staff and has a very complicated online procedure to open a simple savings account. I spent a lot of time trying to open a bank account with them, in the end, it was rejected by a sms and was asked to re-apply online which will take a lot of time. The rejection was due to a ridiculous reason which is a mismatch address between the form and the supporting document in which I think the bank could easily fix. Please improve your procedure of service. A call to the customer would be more appreciated rather than a simple sms notification. I have worked in many places around the world and have opened bank accounts in those countries, and I am very dissappointed to say that this bank gave me the worst experience so far.",
