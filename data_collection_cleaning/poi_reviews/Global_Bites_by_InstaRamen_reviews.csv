ZW Tham,5,"Interesting experience, with boiling water available for fast noodle cooking. It would be perfect if there's a microwave for heating up sides. Price from 2.30 to 2.80 for noodles.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107148152766406693819/reviews

1 Fusionopolis Way, #02-03 Connexis, Singapore 138632

🟩 Was strolling at Fusionpolis complex when we came across this 2nd level vending machine at Connexis building.

✅️ The machine is simple to use.
***********************************
🟧  Just key in the item you want to buy, press ""confirm"", and then pay by Visa.  ( 🟦 just place Visa card at card reader and it goes ""teeeee""=  ✅️ payment done)

🟧 The vending machine panel will then shift to the said level to pick up your item, and then it will drop item down at bin for you to pick up and collect.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
