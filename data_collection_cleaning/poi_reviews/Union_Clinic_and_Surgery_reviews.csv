rendezvous009,3,"I visited this clinic for more than 20 years. For most part the medications are effective except for the cough syrups ( don't take cough syrups anti covid sprays are way better). The downside the doctor is always late for work, no CHAS discounts and no cashless payments.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113365420983041472030/reviews
Edmund Wee,1,"Clinic staff unbelievably rude.
I hope she sees this.

People come because they are sick and not in the best state. That's why patience and understanding is a critical attribute for healthcare workers.

The way she speaks to patients is more akin to... I actually can't think of any other profession where it's tolerable. So there isn't any occupation she might be suitable for. Maybe one where she does not need to communicate with people.

Whatever heartbreak or betrayal that made you this way, is not the fault of your patients. Please do better or work at a mortuary instead. They  are immune to your toxicity.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100491335038078749474/reviews
Isabel Im,1,"Horrible doctor with a extremely bad attitude. My son went to see for diarrhoea due to side effects of taking Augmentin for his bacteria infection.  He just saw another clinic 2 days ago for upper respiratory tract infection and been prescribed all necessary medication for headache, muscle aches and sore throat.  However as soon as he told the Dr he didn't need the flu medicines, the Dr became angry and accused him of buying MC.  He even said things like you cannot don't want the medicine.  What is this horrible doctor doing? He obviously is just being a salesman to reap profit from dispensing medicine.  Of course we all know that clinics got their revenue from selling drugs.  But please, respect your profession and treat you patients with empathy and respect - that's for yourself too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109270351777987098615/reviews
Andrew Lim,1,"Extremely rude person at the reception. Asked if the clinic was open as the signage shows 10am and i was there at 9. Was rudely asked in a loud voice ""how you walked in? If door open, then clinic is open"" . I went on to say fine then I would like to see a Dr, to which she said doctor not in till 10.30am.  These sort of people shouldn't be working in the clinic attending to sick people. Horrible.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102219880673450812651/reviews
Evan Lin Lele,1,"The waiting time is ridiculously long. Came at 11am to get the queue, was told to come back before 12pm to ensure that I am still in the queue. So i came back at 12pm, waited in the holding area for an hour and a half to see the doctor for 2 minutes. Waste of time and effort. The holding area was cold af. my symptoms have been a lot worse after coming to this clinic. No proper queue system in place and yes receptionists were very rude. Clinic is only a last option for me.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102959762976517213722/reviews
