Kim Huat Teo,5,"It's been a while since my wife and I last sing karaoke when Covid started. Decided to give Teo Heng a try since it is short drive from our home.

First impression is the place is new and clean. As it is our first time at Teo Heng, we were figuring out how to use the system ourselves.

We were pleasantly surprised that the reception guy came to our room giving us a short orientation on how to use the system. Definitely a plus on the service. üëç",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105206088009293100331/reviews
