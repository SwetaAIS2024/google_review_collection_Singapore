Brenda Thomas,1,"The customer service here is bad, feels like the staffs ain’t happy working on a Sunday night.

When I walked into the fitting area, the staff just stared at me without saying anything. No asking if I’m trying, no asking how pieces, doesn’t tell me to go ahead to the fitting rooms…

Cashier was also the same, face was kinda black like it was my fault that she has to help me settle my purchases.

While browsing through the shop, noticed that all the staff I came across seems to have the same bad attitude. All seem to be unhappy.

If it isn’t was the clothes that they sell, I will think twice before stepping in here.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102322885085442216087/reviews
Dr Reviews,4,"Pull&Bear is a Spanish clothing and accessories brand. It is part of the Spanish parent company of Zara that is, Inditex.  The brand has three stores(previously four) in Singapore in VivoCity, Bugis and Ion Orchard. We visited the one in VivoCity.

You can get to Pull&Bear from the mall's connection to the train station. Simply exit the station and enter the mall. Take the escalator up to the first floor. Walk straight past the Dyson store and The Hour Glass and turn to your left. A shop or two down and you will be in front of Pull&Bear.

The brand is mainly known for its city style of clothes and accessories. It has a lot of the popular trends infused into its designs.     The cut and shape of the clothes range from curve-accentuating to the oversized-but-not-baggy kinds. However, their form-fitting, body hugging designs which suit the cool, pretty and expensive aesthetic are most definitely not for bigger girls. Bigger girls meaning plus-sized or you don't even have to be plus-sized. You'd have to be literally thin or have a perfect figure to look good in those clothes. Personally, that's a major drawback.

Other than that and the price of the clothing, I really have no other negative comment about the store. Price-wise, the store is expensive. Not Zara-expensive as in break-the-bank prices, expensive as in  clothes are priced the average price of branded clothing In Singapore.

On the plus side, designs for the men's clothing section are not stereotypically boring. There is a little extra creativity and uniqueness put into the designs. Lastly, the store has a sort of starbucks environment to it. For a modernized urban twist on the theme 'nature', the store has a lot of colours relating to brown and yellow like Starbucks. I definitely would visit the store to make more purchases again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112747621045786494145/reviews
Darren Yeo,1,"This brand is a clown which sells substandard products.

Bought a $55.90 short sleeved shirt from vivo outlet a couple of weeks ago. Was ironing the shirt at medium heat and the cloth just gave way and burnt through. It seems like the shirt is made of cloth with paper quality.

Went to the store to check what happened. The assistant told me the shirt should be able to withstand ironing heat of 150-230 degree Celsius (C) based on the product specifications,  but referred me to the lady manager.

The manager initially concurred on the product specifications but after I told her what happened, she twisted her words and said that due to the thickness of the shirt, the ironing heat should be less than 100C, based on the two dots indicated on the ironing logo, whereby one dot represents 50C.

Who the hell will know that each dot on the ironing logo represents 50C. If the ironing heat will cause potential damage to the shirt, the recommended temperature should be shown clearly beside the ironing logo.

No wonder the same shirt is going for sale at $29.90 within such a short time.

While the designs are nice, the product quality and customer service are absolute TRASH.

Won’t patronize them anymore.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102232648465634292693/reviews

Yuan,1,"If I could rate zero star I would. I went to the store with my family at 30/12 930pm ish and left at 10pm.

This customer service here is not professional nor friendly and helpful!

I entered the fitting room to try clothes and the staff at the counter FR sighed really loudly twice like are u trying to let me hear? I get ur tired but is this the kind of professionalism u have ? Do u train ur staff at all? What do u want the customer to feel? Apologetic? Guilty?

Next the door closes and we wanted to go out the lady working there kindly helped us open while carrying a jacket. This caused the door sensor to ring! I wonder how that happened ? She stopped to check us with a black face and after us telling her it’s her jacket she let us go without apologising like what kind of service is this? We bought it stuff and got treated like that? Like at least apologise if u have mistaken la

Overall Pull and Bear please give the staff enough trainings they seem like they don’t want to work there.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108563944347231290411/reviews
