Order kai lan, sunkiss pork rib ( chef recommend ) prawn ball, crab meat maw soup Crab was meaty and not watery. My daughter dont really eat vegetables enjoyed it. Will definitely be my next go to place for future crab craving.

Solomon Pika,1,"Bad unfresh crab mix with one good crab when you order 2 for takeaway. Everytime purposely mix the bad crab in when you dont dine in. No intergrity. You can see from my photo, top one is bad, bottom one is fresh. If you eat crab, you can easily see.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114196295153415761746/reviews
J M,1,"Mookata’s meat portions were small and honestly not that great.

We were eating Mookata when 4 cockroaches came out of the portable gas stove. Not sure if the mookata is under Uncle Leong but they had the same menu booklet. Staff still told us that they used the gas stove the day before to cook and nothing happened lol cool but it happened today and we were disgusted by it.

Dine there if you fancy having some cockroach buddies.

However, staff attempted service recovery by “treating us” for the meal.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113022886722094715754/reviews

I like the Crab Bee Hoon, it tastes light and flavourful soup. Must try their Sunkist Pork Rib, the meat is tender and it has an unique sunkist flavour, refreshing and delicious.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100395767086588692053/reviews
