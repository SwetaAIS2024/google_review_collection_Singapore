Shengyang Yu,5,"I have been visiting MICRO quite frequently and I really enjoyed both services and food. Their bread are top notch and fluffy, even my toddler enjoys their bread a lot.

The food is there is also delicious and hearty. We enjoyed the Kimchi sandwich a lot(only on weekends). Overall this is the must visit place if you are around the area, if not you will regret it.

The queue can be long, so be sure to queue and get a number.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116678951093768736283/reviews
Melissa Eisner,5,"Yummy tasty bakery goodness … that’s how I’d describe @microbakerykitchen off of Bukit Timah road. Sure, the Serene Center is not the sexiest location, but the baked goods here bring the sexy back! I didn’t stay here to dine in as I had this amazing homemade fig jam at home with my name on it, so I picked up a loaf of the sourdough, and because they were calling my name, a couple of lemon cranberry scones. And, since I was walking, I got an iced coffee to go.

At home, the bread toasted all up was the perfect vehicle for butter and jam. The crust was crunchy and the inside was soft with the right amount of chew. My coffee was awesome … not sure where they source the beans but it was a nice smooth iced coffee with oat milk that totally hit the spot. Later in the day I enjoyed the scone and it was flaky and sweet and tart, perfect for enjoying with a cup of tea. Can’t wait for my next walk on  Saturday to grab some more goodies from this spot",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117316308946167178763/reviews
Lenon Tan,5,"Weekend 8am breakfast was a bit crowded and it was easy to see why. Pastries and main sets were fresh and sumptuous. Coffee was great, among the best i've tasted.

Service was efficient and commendable for thoughtfulness. We ordered at bakery inside (they have two separate shops) but tables all occupied, cashier helpfully suggested we order coffee at other outlet bcos here disposable cups but outside better cups.

Environment is clean and nice vibes (pet friendly so plenty of furry pals)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108531854195491062188/reviews
Touristmouse,5,"I initially attempted to walk in and purchase a sourdough, only to learn that pre-orders are required two days in advance. While disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised to discover their delicious kombu butter. It's incredibly smooth and boasts a rich umami flavor.
I later preordered a Country Sourdough ($13) and collection was a breeze. The friendly crew also offered slicing service upon request. The two-day wait is due to slow fermentation, resulting in a loaf with the perfect chewy texture and a truly distinctive aroma. Honestly, this has to be the best sourdough I've tried recently. I will definitely be returning for more.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110409011587721664076/reviews
Nic,4,"love the creative menu options - want to try everything on the menu and in the display case!!!

i'm a big fan of the smashed potato tartine ($6), but the fig cream cheese tartine ($6) was a miss i feel - the pairing with the bread didn't work so well, didn't help that the figs rolled off and the cream cheese chunks were hard. maybe a cream cheese spread and a brioche bread would have worked better?

not gg to stop me from cmg back to try other options

coffee is great albeit small and comes with a beautiful paper straw that held up!!
