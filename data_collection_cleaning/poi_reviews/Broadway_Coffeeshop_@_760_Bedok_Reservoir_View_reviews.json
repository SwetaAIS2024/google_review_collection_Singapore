The Chicken Rice shop was great – the food tasted delicious and the staff were very friendly.\n\nThere are other stalls too, like the Wak Min Muslim stall and the Xiang Wei Braised Duck stall.\n\nOverall, the coffee shop is very clean. HDB parking available.",

Can’t go wrong with Nasi lemak (swapped chicken for tempeh) at $3.50 and iced coffee at $2.10- superb taste atmosphere and value and happily wasted a couple of hours here. Lucky locals !!",

It wasn’t very warm, but it was good and satiated our Indian chaat cravings. Comes sprinkled with chana masala (chickpeas), sev and boondi.\n\nWe washed it down with Milo & Kopi-c. Good strong kopi.",

The cashier got distracted and cannot process customer requests smoothly. I looked at that lady and asked if they have finished, signalling dissatisfaction, but she continued anyways. I don’t understand what is so important that the lady must impair the stall’s function when customers are already standing there. She can quit her job if she doesn’t like it.",
