Lionel,4,"Ordered the pork chop and chicken cutlet for $9.80 each.

Very nice meal! If you're a fan of lok lok, don’t miss the fried broccoli – super shiok! Will definitely come back to try other dishes.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114987248048361781546/reviews

Understand that they are busy, there's a notice shown that the food are cook fresh upon order,need to wait for the food, but it's definitely worth the wait and value for money.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104634555513612198539/reviews
Jack,4,The grilled chicken and pork set was really quite good and generous. Chicken thigh meat was well marinated and tender. Price is also very reasonable. Spaghetti with chicken was good too. Comes with full chicken thigh again. Spaghetti was creamy. Much better value and quality than you get from Astons in the same building.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288565584051666357/reviews
Jeslyn Chin,4,"Delicious carbonara spaghetti. Tried both mentaiko salmon carbonara and truffle pork  carbonara, taste good! A pity the salmon is overcooked, thus more dry and hard. Fish & Chips is crispy on the outside, juicy and tender inside. Foods are well presented on plates. Highly affordable. Waiting time is reasonable. Will be back to try more food. The only downside is the food court is stuffy and hot.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115819778291645655762/reviews
Sherab Tenzin,5,"It's located at the ground floor food court of building 750B of Chai Chee ESR BIZ Park.

Items are delicious and fairly priced. I have ordered grilled chicken & Dory Monster Combo, and classic chicken cutlet at $9.9 each.

The size is very generously large given their prices. I really enjoyed the meal. Will visit it again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115240875636662687058/reviews
