      "text": "One of the best grilled fish üêü I've eaten, I ordered the grilled fish for only 7 FREAKING dollars üíµ, it's such a cheap price for a delicious meal. It's the stall's must try top meal and it did not disappoint. üôÇ\n\nThe food was cooked fast and meal was filled with many items. üí¨\n\nThe fish was soft and soaked in sour cream. It tasted really delicious and with a great mix of flavors. The fries üçü were crispy and the portions were just right, not too much or too little. The baked beans ü´ò were nice and hot. The coleslaw ü•ó was cold but added some nice vegetables to the meal. There are also some lettuce ü•¨ hidden under the fish too.\n\nWith its fantastic price compared to other western food stalls in Singapore, I would highly recommend people to come and try the dishes especially the grilled fish. üëç\n\nüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü",

You don‚Äôt have to saw the meat or chew till the cows come home (you get the idea). Fish & Chips and chicken wings were pretty decent too.",

Food is well cooked and tasty. Only down side is slightly overpowered by their oyster sauce marination. It would be alot better if its lighter so that we can enjoy it with the sauce, coleslaw and fries. Price is reasonable for the portion served.",
