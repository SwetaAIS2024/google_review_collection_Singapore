Ribeye,4,"Good roast duck and crispy roast pork. Friendly boss asked us if we wanted the head when we ordered whole duck and gave a large bowl of soup.
Roast pork crispy skin is the highlight, charsiew is the well marbled heavily sauced rich sticky kind but could have been charred a little more.
Noodles were just ok, had some pork lard bits but were otherwise a little too plain and under seasoned.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108129213100021627372/reviews

Raymond Ng,4,"Tried the noodles, the ingredients were plentiful. Meat was tasty, but overall, the taste was like having a bowl of chicken curry noodles rather than a bowl of Ipoh curry noodles. So, 3 stars only for me.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111876314764707237157/reviews
