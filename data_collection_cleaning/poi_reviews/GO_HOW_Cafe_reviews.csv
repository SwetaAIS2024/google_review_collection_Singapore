Kimchi fried rice is the best one I have ever had - flavourful and moist!

Chicken big serving and yum, mapo tofu v flavourful too.

julia,5,"When I visited here, I was so moved by the peaceful interior. The coffee was so fresh and you can taste the best coffee by far. It is run by a Korean family, so you can taste delicious Korean food. If you come to Eco Botanic, I recommend you to visit",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105333513386450100602/reviews

Anne,5,"The food here is so good! The first time we came, we had the kimchi fried rice and tteokbokki, and they were amazing. We’ve been coming back ever since. The salted egg spaghetti is really good too, and the portions are big. Recently, we tried the matcha latte from the new menu, and it’s honestly the best I’ve ever had. The service is great, and the food always comes out fast. Definitely a favourite spot!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103677353063790612164/reviews
