Zahryn Zakaria,1,"Whoever is the dental staff that picks up the phone at winsome whampoa is very rude and unprofessional. My wisdom tooth erupted and i was in pain so i called in at 9am to check if they accepted walk ins since the clinic is located opposite my house.
First thing the women said otp, ‚ÄúAre you (some random person‚Äôs name)?‚Äù.
No hello and no good morning.
When i replied no i‚Äôm not and that i was just calling in to check if yall do walk ins since its an emergency regarding my wisdom tooth, your staff replied, ‚Äúyou go somewhere else. We fully booked‚Äù
Like okay, i understand if you guys are fully booked but there is a better way to say it. Also what a way to deter potential new customers. When i asked again if your clinic accept walk-ins even if its an emergency, she responded ‚Äúdoctor not in. doctor off. you go somewhere else‚Äù.
What a rude response.
Eventually your staff did mention to ‚Äútry my luck‚Äù and walk-in tmrw.
Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place lol.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113477844319163434112/reviews
H Tan,1,"The Doctor wanted to charge me $70 initially for consultation and medication, then when I said it is too expensive, he suggested using medisave to pay partially. Ended up I paid $40 out of pocket and $100 medisave. Please check prices when you see him. :(",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113362081689522344836/reviews
