WM,5,"This is a place where individuals and multitudes gather to pray, give thanks and pour out their hearts to the LORD.

The cathedral is built in 1847. It has a rich history and survived the invasion by the Japanese during World War II.

Services are held weekly. The place is always packed on Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Christmas seasons.

Please spend some time to kneel and pray at this place if you have not visited this Cathedral before.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105398767199270855281/reviews
