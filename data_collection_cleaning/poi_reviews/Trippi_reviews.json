The drink selection is fantastic and the cocktails are not only visually stunning but also incredibly refreshing !! Especially the green frozen drink I had, which was a perfect mix of flavors.\n\nThe staff is friendly and attentive adding to the overall great experience. Whether you’re looking to chill by the pool or enjoy a lively evening, this place is a must-visit. Highly recommend!",
