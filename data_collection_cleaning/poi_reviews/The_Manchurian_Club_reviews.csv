Muthukumar Arumugam,4,"A decent and spacious outlet for Indo-chinese cuisine. Quick serve is a plus when you make your order from the table.

You are being checked often for any of your immediate needs by having by frequent visits by the servers to the table.

Most of the items are good and tasty but certain items are too saucy. Nevertheless the taste over shoots the saucy.

Lots of options for vegetarian people and absolutely kids friendly.
