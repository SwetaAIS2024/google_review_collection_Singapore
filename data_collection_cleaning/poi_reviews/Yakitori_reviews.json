The yakitori sticks were all overcooked and bland, with little to no seasoning on it also\n\nService was poor, staff were rude and condescending during order, and was very pushy and annoyed when I just tried to put in an order\n\nOverall the experience left me with disappointment and a half finished bowl of food which I could not stomach anymore. Coming from someone who'd eat anything to clear the plate, this food was not enjoyable in the slightest\n\nWould give 0/5 if possible, need to work on their food and their poor customer service",
