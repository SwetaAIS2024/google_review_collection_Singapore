Gareth Chen,5,My Daughter has been going to this preschool from 18months and she loves it. She’s really learned a lot since joining and my Wife and I love the fact that it’s bilingual as we would not have been able to teach her sufficient Chinese at home. I just wish they had an infant care at this branch so that I could have started my Son in the same school.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102286937499133010807/reviews
