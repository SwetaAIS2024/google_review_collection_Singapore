Tried the mozerella focacia and it was average. the price does not really justify. Got a chai latte, basically tea bag style + milk. Maybe check if their kitchen is open before making your way down as it is quite out of the way.",

      "text": "One of the worst place to dine in.\n\n1. We ordered some pastries and truffle fries. The food was below average. Not worth the price point.\n\n2. We took the seat closest to the kitchen. It was very warm even though the staff claimed the air con is turned on. My family was sweating throughout and that was very unpleasant.\n\n3. Halfway, we realized there was a huge cockroach on the ceiling where we were sitting. Informed one of the staff who asked 'pardon' with a frown. I repeated that there was a cockroach and she simply said OK and turned away.\n\nWhile I can understand that every fnb establishment, it is normal to have pests. But it's the staff's attitude towards the matter that concerns me. Another staff did acknowledge and said she will inform the manager.\n\nOverall, I cannot find any reason to return to this place. Unimpressive food, price point, service and ambience.",

Wait for people, read a book, use your laptop. Perfect spot.\nPlank which serves pizza is in the same place and they're pizzas are pretty decent too.  But I just had coffee today",

We had the Cappuccino and Apple Tangs for drinks.\nThe pizza did not disappoint with its fresh taste of dough, tomato sauce base and chewy cheese covered with well cooked mushroom slices. The other pizza was a refreshingly sweet than savory.\nEnjoyed the great Cappuccino made with care and the apple tangs were thirst quenching esp inches hot weather.",
