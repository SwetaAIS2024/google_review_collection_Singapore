Mck NW,3,the entrance to MacRitchie trail was temporary closed when I went there on 10 Aug 2018 due to maintenance work. We have to take bus for 1 stop to BEFORE SICC and take the overhead bridge to opposite road for entry to MacRitchie Trail. Do check before you alighting at this stop to enter the trail.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108398586572872381724/reviews
