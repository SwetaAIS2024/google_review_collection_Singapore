Falsefast,3,"The CNY edition of the Original All Chocolate Cake was good. Itâ€™s moist, not too sweet and chocolatey. Loved the packaging, too. I picked up my order from the store and was served by a grumpy bespectacled male Chinese staff. If that was the store manager, perhaps the management should send him to attend a customer service course. Heâ€™s just not service-oriented, no smile, no thank you, just an unhappy employee attending to customers.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107614224395170529226/reviews
