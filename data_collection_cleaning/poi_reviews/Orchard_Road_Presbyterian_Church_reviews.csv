Dian,1,"Just visited there to attend 6pm service but got chase out by the parking attendant who said that no visitor or even member are allowed to park even though their carpark is empty.

The pastor spoken about being good Samaritan but in reality the church did not  accommodating at all.

Now I fully understanding why this church is the total opposite in both building appearance and the amount of congregation with the church on top.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117293036907976270458/reviews
Astraeus Brigham,5,"A very old church in singapore, built all the way back to 1878, being the oldest Presbyterian church in singapore. Initially it was built for the Scottish community, but gradually caters to a congregation of different backgrounds. There are multiple services, while the english marina service is at sunday 9am and afternoon (two per week) there are also chinese service.
Personally i found the design of the church very attractive, and i would rank it as one of the most appealing churches in singapore (both exterior and interior) somehow it's built next to a small hill, and all those plants surrounding makes it so delicate. The teaching is quite traditional and the atmosphere is conducive, both staff and pastries are very helpful and enlightening ( pastor in their suits look really professional) their choir is also very decent.
I would recommend this church to all of you even if you are just a vistor (can walk in without anyone asking or pestering anything) enjoy~",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102982344275567995798/reviews
Ravish M,5,"Beautiful church building observed while walking from YMCA towards Plaza Singapura. Clicked some pictures of this beautiful white church building from outside. As searched online, this church building was completed in 1878 and is located near Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. There is one bus stop just outside the entrance of this church.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116138807654098240752/reviews
