Tianle Weng,5,"Thai style charcoal mookata. Broth is good. Thai instant noodles. Rice well cooked.
Minimum order 39.90 set for 2 excluding rice and noodles. Portion size is sufficient.

Mookata available for dinner only. Free parking on Sunday evening, and probably pets friendly too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109011295686310991647/reviews
Chelvin Yong,5,"Meat has great flavour, the mookata uses charcoal so everything cooks really fast. Maybe one point of improvement would be more sauce choices, but overall good experience.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116794157690571128699/reviews
Ma Xianrong,5,"Didn't expect to find a tasty mookata here in the bedok JTC area. Food taste great at a value price point. Big ass fans to keep u cool and also circurate the air to keep u smelling less like mookata after your meal. Meats are well marinated, chilli with garlic awesome. Taste reminds me of the new udon before they moved away from golden mile.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111025741012326721366/reviews
Ruyan Tay,5,Repeat customer here. Nice to chill and mookata slowly. Cos there's usually no crowds and dog friendly too. Food is also v economical (39.9 for 2 pax) and you will be very full.

Sherwin Ashley Teo,5,"On a monday night it was quiet, windy and spacious. The store helper was very nice and even helped to grilled the first round of meat. Cut of meat was lean and not super fatty which made it super good for it price point compared to other joints. Overall exp was above decent and the set for two was filling. 10/10 would come back for the vibes and meat quality for it value! Kudos to the store helper for the service which was totally unexpected.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107197906354816125182/reviews
