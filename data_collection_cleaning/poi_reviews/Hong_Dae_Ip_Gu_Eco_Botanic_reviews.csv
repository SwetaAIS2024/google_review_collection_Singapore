Diana G.B,5,"Had our second visit to Hongdae Korean BBQ and it definitely won’t be our last! We ordered the 2-pax Set 5, which was more than enough food — generous portions and great value. The banchan (side dishes) were all delicious and refillable, which is always a plus at a Korean BBQ spot.

Service was excellent — for a small fee (around RM10), the staff grilled the pork for us to perfection. Everything was cooked just right, letting us enjoy the meal without the stress of grilling ourselves.

Great food, solid service, and a chill atmosphere. Highly recommend for anyone craving authentic Korean BBQ in Johor!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108591246692339183334/reviews
Skye Cai,3,"Tried the set A and add on boneless beef briskets.
Beef briskets are sweet base marinated. Good to go for a few bites, gets too heavy afterwards. The beef quality is good, tender and juicy.
Pork belly slices are quite oily with heavy pork taste.
The set comes with steamed eggs and the seafood soup. Seafood soup with good portioning of the egg tofu.
The floor is very oily, slippery.
Will not go again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Terry Chua,4,"Very nice authentic Korean food. Ordered the marinated pork collar and pork ribs with aged kimchi stew. Everything was delicious, especially the paste in the stew. I felt that the steam egg was a bit wet and thus not fluffy enough. Other than that, great place to have a meal.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114779419389907602398/reviews
Eve C,4,"My hubby dislike Korean BBQ because he felt he wasn't having a good eating while having to grill meat. He also dislike the smoke and smell from bbq. However Hong Dae Ip offers the perfect solution for all of us (kids and adults) because you still can have the korean BBQ and they are cooked on separately by the staff and bring to your table. Hence the whole restaurant dont smell and is not smoky at all!

The banchan are nice and they refill them when we need it.

They have bbq set meals, ala bbq meat, pancakes and stew. The staff are well trained and there is a Indian manager (I assume) to make sure operations run smooth.

I was cold from the air con (with fan attached) but they promptly adjusted it.

I called the WhatsApp number to book a table and it was also promptly answered.

Love the experience and would definitely visit again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews
김건우,5,"Absolutely loved our dinner at Hong Dae Ip Gu Eco Botanic!
The grilled beef brisket (우삽겹) and pork belly were fantastic — juicy, tender, and perfectly cooked. The side dishes were plentiful and delicious, and the service was warm, attentive, and very kind. We also enjoyed some classic Korean “so-maek” (soju + beer), which completed the experience. The atmosphere was lively yet cozy — perfect for both families and friends.
Highly recommend this place if you’re craving authentic Korean BBQ in Johor Bahru!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106729004699549604531/reviews
