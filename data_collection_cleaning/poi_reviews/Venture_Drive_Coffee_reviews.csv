Seah Jia Hui,5,"Rich people coffee. The brash boy/little big coffee of NTU. Very well made coffee that you find in cafe. Queue will be a little long during lunch hours, around 10-20 mins wait as there is only 1 staff taking the order and making the coffee. If you have a high paying job and are willing to spend more to get a good quality coffee then sure. If you are a peasant student then kopi from Koufu or instant coffee from prime will do the job just as well.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews
Irina Kartseva,5,"Great specialty coffee, best one on campus.

Hot coffee there have a plasent flavor taste, have never been disappointed. It’s worth here to try different beans - great choice.

Not a lover of an ice coffee here tbh, but I think it’s more personal)

Student discount is a great addition ➕

Matcha I took once - wasn't fully mixed - because it was whipped right in the cup (so for that - I’m going to Starbucks)",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109535053559157627105/reviews
Daniel Lee,5,"Great place if you are looking for an acid, floural, clean, specialty coffee.

Don't be fooled by the Google map though. It's located near the center of the North Spine Plaza, unlike where it is pinned on Google map.

I had to wander around about ten minutes from the pinned point to find here, but the coffee was worth the trip.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104535328518354147812/reviews

Helen Ng,5,"NTU students and staff are so blessed to have this great coffee in the campus. Aromatic, smooth and well balanced. You get to also choose from 5 types of beans for your coffee (white / black). Just take note of the limited seating inside the cafe.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108720959723803578599/reviews
