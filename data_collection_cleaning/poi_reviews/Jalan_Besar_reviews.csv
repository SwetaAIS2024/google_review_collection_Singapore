Kus Kus,5,Awesome passenger service~! Thank you so much for saving me~! Today around 7:50am I accidentally hurt my back while getting out of the train due to my heavy backpack. The pain was so bad I felt faint. The manager mr Joshua Lee was present and I called for help. He was so kind to assist till I can speak. Mr Sathish Kumar and Mr Asaraf then helped wheel me to the nearest clinic and register. After that Mr Sathish also help me got into a cab to go home. I am so appreciative of the staff there. They went above and beyond to make sure I am safe and cared for. I am now home safe. Thank you so much. ^^,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100729405894348522026/reviews

Bryan Choo,5,"Its a very convenient MRT station that is located near many eateries and other MRT lines.

This station was also recently opened as such most of the lifts and escalators are as well. If you are ever feeling hungry or thirsty there is a small convenience store located one floor above the ticketing area",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103855221884967000667/reviews
