      "text": "Burgers were tasty, but I wouldn’t say it’s superb or outstanding as the other reviews point out. Meat was nicely charred and you do have a choice over how well you want the beef to be cooked. The sauces, especially the blue cheese and house buttermilk dill in the Greg Norman ($28) were harmonious. The Wagyu steakhouse burger was the favourite between me and my partner. The portions were also a work of American art too.\n\nNow for the price, it is however, underwhelming. The onion rings and fries were not particularly seasoned or flavourful. The burger themselves, while good were not exactly mindblowing or the experience you’d expect from such a popular place as this. The staff were also dealing with a high volume of guests, so even though dedicated attention was structured into their hospitality policy, they do seem stretched.",

      "text": "Disappointing experience last evening as honestly the food was not up to what I would expect from Black Tap and as a dining venue within the prestigious Marina Bay Sands. We were seated in the back right corner area, a rather dark space with little character nor ambiance. The service team was nice, but getting their attention to take our order and for other items while we dined was challenging. Only the back server/bus boy was super attentive and constantly on the move, a young man with a darker complexion.\n\nAs for the food, my wife ordered the Impossible Burger, which she has had in many other establishments. The “meat” patty was overly salty and as a whole the burger was plain boring. I had the portobello mushroom sandwich and the mushroom was overly fried, tasting more like the oil it was fried in rather than anything mushroom. The accompanying sweet potato fries we both ordered at an extra cost with our burgers were soggy, horribly limp things, that oozed oil to the touch (see photo). After our initial order had gone in, we asked a waitress if we could add crispy onions to my wife’s Impossible Burger,  we got a full order of fried onion rings instead - okay, fair enough mistake, but not what we requested. Those onion rings were okay, but so wide cut, not really enjoyable. We also ordered the brussel sprouts appetizer, they were tasty on their own, probably the best thing we ordered, but the accompanying sauce was too vinegary, not really a good compliment to the sprouts.\n\nOverall, a real disappointment considering the price we paid, location and expectations. We will not be dining here again despite being regular visitors to Singapore and Marina Bay Sands.",

To me this is a great location with many shops, eateries, and places to have coffee, tea, and drinks.\n\nThe food was amazing we hand the burgers that were voted the best. They did not disappoint. The Waygu Burger and The Greg Norman. The Mexican Hot Sauce and Korean BBQ 8/10. We found the shakes was alright just an acquired taste.",

      "text": "Been in my check list for some time, decided to drop by for a quick dinner on a Monday night. Service was ok but found the waiter's tone a bit condescending & unfriendly. Placed our orders through anyway and it came promptly.\n\nOrdered a burger AND a crazyshake all to myself - one of the biggest mistakes of my adult life. To say that the crazy shake was CRAZY would be an understatement - it was actually insane. Massive cup filled with ingredients, even came with an oreo ice cream cake stuck on the side. Drank half of it before the burger came.\n\nBurgers were good. I had the wagyu steakhouse burger. Fries were well salted - but to get some other sauce to go with it, there was a $2 charge. Forgot which sauce I got but it was nice! Think it was the roasted garlic aioli. Anywho, had my burger medium, nice and pink in the middle. Overall experience was good but I couldn't sleep after that cause I was just too full from the whole meal.",

      "text": "Interesting selection of burgers, pretty good. Small menu with mainly burgers, not much variety for starters or other main course.\n\nThe milkshake with cake looks pretty but taste is below average. Cheesecake with strawberry milkshake tasted artificial and kinda starchy. Black & white has better choc milkshake but cake is dry and stale, using icing instead of cream so it’s very sweet\n\nService is hit and miss.",
