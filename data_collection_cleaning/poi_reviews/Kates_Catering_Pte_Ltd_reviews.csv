Winston Sng,5,"I've been ordering from Kate's Catering for CNY 2023, 2024, 2025 and they have provided me with excellent service. The ordering and payment processes were smooth and seamless via emails and electronic payments. The deliveries were always on time. The food was tasty with ample portions based on the number of people to be fed and the price has been reasonable. Will surely be going back to them again. Well done Kate's Catering!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111004570037483958199/reviews

Melissa Sanicas,5,"Our team had a department breakfast and lunch separately, and we ordered from them.

I didn't take photo of the lunch but both bento boxes, breakfast and lunch, were enjoyed by the teams. My boss and colleagues liked the food quality, they even asked for the website to consider for their future personal gatherings.

Delivery is on time. Always 30mins before eating time. Communication is fast both by email and WhatsApp. Everything was smooth.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105233173701385532460/reviews
MH C,4,"The CS team is very responsive to enquiry and the ordering process is smooth.
We ordered the mini vegetarian buffet plus additional curry chicken for the guests.
The food arrived safe and timely. Portion is generous and packed tidily and the guests enjoyed the vegetarian prawn fritters and sweet sour fish dish.
Only problem we encountered is that the fried tofu in the braised tofu dish tastes sour and spoilt, so most of us avoided that dish and spit out the tofu on the first bite.
Other than that unfortunate dish, it was a pleasant experience overall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103512642131931999291/reviews
