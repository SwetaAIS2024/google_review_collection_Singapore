Benjamin Lee,5,"I eat about once a month here with my kids, they loved these 3 items on the menu:
- Avocado toast
- Breakfast taco
- Breakfast quesadillas

On 4 May, Jonas was helpful and even suggested that my children can have hot chocolate instead of cold canned milo. He had also observed that after the milk foam settled, and offered a top up of milk in my latte.

Highly recommended as a breakfast place to chill and enjoy your breakfast!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102424884249921152250/reviews
Mabbel Elroy,4,"We love Guzman and haven’t had it in a while, so we were excited to visit this branch. The atmosphere and vibes here really stand out compared to their other locations.

However, we were a bit disappointed with what we received after ordering. We missed how Guzman used to include both sour cream and guacamole as part of the meal. Now, guacamole is only available as an add-on, and we couldn’t find sour cream anywhere on the menu. As a result, the taste just wasn’t the same any longer..

In addition to our recent visit, there were a lot of houseflies flying around near the counters, not sure if there’s proper hygiene in that..",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102879096020874056848/reviews
Carol T,5,"as a regular foodpanda customer, this round i’m extremely disappointed by the black beans - at the same price, it’s now downsized to a miserable HALF portion. seriously??? who would pay such a price for it? if i knew they have downsized i def wouldn’t have ordered. such a rip-off.

UPDATE (10/4/25)
first of all, I really appreciate the fact that you've taken the effort to look into this matter. I actually did not actually expect a response – not to mention such a prompt one too. it reflects your commitment to prioritize customers’ satisfaction. for that initiative alone, BRAVO!
I've returned today to use the voucher you kindly offered, and am glad that the portion of the black beans has returned to the original size! you've def redeemed yourself with your quick actions to earn & deserve a 5-star. keep up the great job!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115733230464127770640/reviews

Lon,2,"Disappointing visit. Love the pulled pork from gyg usually but this time it was in huge chunks and not pulled.

We were also given wrong set of tacos (ordered 1 soft shell 1 hard shell, got 2 hard shell). We got it replaced but it was not too crowded at the time so it made us wonder why the food quality was lower than usual.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108560953497177915218/reviews
