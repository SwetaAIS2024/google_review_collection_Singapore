Desmond,5,"Birthday dinner:
- as a wine bar ordering wine is mandatory, the sommelier was very helpful and struck up conversations here and there
- there is a good selection of wine and clearly the food in the menu is curated to pair nicely with the wine list

- the onion tarte was extremely interesting, very nice caramelized onion jam served on top of a wafer thin crust with saltiness coming from olives and anchovies which complimented the onions very well. It was also peppery which was a nice kick

- the pate was very nice, and also went well with the sourdough which they served.

- the small bites were the sardines which was a nice and tarte which provided almost a palette cleanser.

- the T bone steak was the special of the day and the portion was generous and the steak tender and well seasoned. The salad on the site was also full of citrus notes which was very nice to cut the richness of the steak.

- the seabass was nicely smoked and tender although the serving size could be improved. I was expecting a full fish for the price.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106181861952982791006/reviews
Sonia Gan,5,"Charming restaurant with an impressive wine list and exquisite French food worthy of its Michelin star accolades. All the times Iâ€™ve visited, food, wines and service were impeccable. Many of the dishes were outstanding - the pissaladiere, the scallops, lambâ€¦ the pigeon dish was the best Iâ€™ve had. The atmosphere is relaxed yet refined. Itâ€™s a must-visit for authentic French food in Singapore.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106200877720771317554/reviews
D L,5,"Tried their breakfast, which was yummy with the usual breakfast suspects plus bonus interesting options.  Do try their Kaya French toast with creme anglais. Great service, which is especially hard to find at other establishments on an early weekday morning.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117029556902099115555/reviews
Clement Lev,5,"An incredible experience from start to finish! The service was absolutely impeccable with a team that truly knows how to elevate the dining experience. I started with the foie gras, simply outstanding and probably one of the best Iâ€™ve ever had. Then came the Burgundy snails, a classic that was executed to perfection. For the main course, the rack of lamb was an absolute showstopper, perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. And to end on a high note, the mandarin soufflÃ© was light, flavorful and simply divine. An unforgettable meal! + amazing wine list â€¦.ðŸ¤© will come back.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117475660880568772802/reviews
