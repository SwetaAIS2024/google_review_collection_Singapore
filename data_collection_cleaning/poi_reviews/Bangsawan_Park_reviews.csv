Jean Chai,5,"Great little playground for young kids - lots of slides, swings and a little merry go round. There is also a fitness corner. Gets sunny in the mornings and evenings but it is shaded so still quite pleasant. Most of the sun goes by 6pm. Close to eateries like Baker and Cook, Plank and Saffron Catering for dining options (within walking distance)",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115391654025827815074/reviews

Pam Foo,4,"Quiet but very well maintained park playground with swings, slides, some of them real fast and some small for the little ones, merry go round, and lots of empty spaces to play catching, or just play with falling leaves. It's right behind baker and cook and other cafes right around the corner, but a secret little gem that brunch parents haven't seen to find out about!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117464460342332566430/reviews
Karen Koh,3,"It is a small, cosy space. It has a few exercise machines for adults and a playground jungle gym for children. A charming, secluded spot which seems constantly surrounded by parked vehicles.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107578703882002387806/reviews
