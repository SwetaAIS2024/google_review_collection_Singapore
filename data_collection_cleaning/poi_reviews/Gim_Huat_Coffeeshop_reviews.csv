megan,5,"The vegetarian food is pretty legit.
It‚Äôs also quite cheap / economical at 4 dollars with 2 ‚Äòmeat‚Äô and 1 vegetable.
I don‚Äôt know how but I finished eating the brown rice so fast. The curry sauce is curry sauce - not the hainanese type but it‚Äôs caifan curry sauce.
The dish is pretty oily but I think the rice can soak up the oils üòÖ

Another caifan stall (non-vegetarian) is also quite popular. It‚Äôs 5 dollars for what I got - chicken chop, brinjal, tofu and vegetable. More expensive slightly? But the curry sauce tastes lighter. Still a good one. There‚Äôs always a queue here haha",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100978343250742524720/reviews
Patty Palmer,5,Charcoal grilled bread or French loaf with thick kaya and butter. Both equally good. Coffee and tea made well and prices right. Gets crowded on weekends,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104267121234826142408/reviews
KW HO,4,Hong Shun Sarawak Noodles. I had the classic $4.50 bowl and it was delicious! Every strand of noodles was evenly coated with the light yet fragrant sauce. Very yummy. I‚Äôll be back!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106000450062109723276/reviews
Steve,4,"High quality wanton mee from Deng Wen Ji which open recently. They have several branches and the noodles taste very much like Kok Kee but much value for money (x2 portion) for the same price ($5)

Needless to say Sin Ming Roti Prata is among the best prata. Consistent and great taste üëç

The kopi, tea and toast is great too!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108679347901594276134/reviews
CW Goh,5,"Very crispy prata. Worth the queue if you have time. Small place though, so may not be able to find a seat. Also if you want to order drinks, just wait for the uncle to come to your table. Saw some people rejected for queuing up for drinks. Apparently it‚Äôs only for takeaway.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115037630565999841304/reviews
