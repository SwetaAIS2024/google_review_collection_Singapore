The price is steep $19 for chix and $22 for fish as you have to top up additional 4-5 bucks for normal or truffle fries/sweet potato fries. Kids prefer the chix over fish.\n\nBoth indoor and outdoor dining space with a play area for kids.",

Parking was easy though the restaurant was hidden from view until you talk in and discovered it was part of Baker&Cook.\nBurgers seem a little pricey and didn’t come with fries which I had to order as side.\nPortion and taste wise, it was pretty decent and the truffle fries remained crispy when I got home ( though the paper bag was soaked through with oil).\nDidn’t dine in so can’t comment on the service but the place seems catered for couples and small families.",

The combination of the fried chicken and Cranbury sauce are absolutely amazing plus strong cemerbert cheese which bring the burger to another level. I enjoyed the sourdough buns very much.\nFor ingredients are fresh and the burger or a freshly made.\nI think it would be great that they have more sauces for the chips and more vegetable options\n\nEnvironment : Very clean and good for friends who are hungry for quick nice burgers.\n\nService : Very friendly staffs and quick service.\n\nPrice : $ 25 / person (plus drinks )",

The burger was cooked to well done, and the thick meaty beef patty really did justice to the flavour and the overall taste to the burger. However, we did wish that the patty was juicier, it was slightly overcooked and led to it tasting a little dry.",
