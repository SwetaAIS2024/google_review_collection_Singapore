Buren,4,"Cinema: okay, seat comfortable enough, clean enough, sound is great, everything to standard

Ticketing and staff: nothing sparkling
Staff is not informative. We asked about the show timing, he showed us a screen full of everything and every show we had to wince and look for the title.

Gate only open right at the time, had to wait outside.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103975090698079167241/reviews
JM V,4,"We recently visited Golden Village at Plaza Singapura to watch Hello Love Again. Our ticket was for 7 PM, and while waiting, I grabbed some snacks and drinks as usual. After 7 PM, they let us in, and the experience was nice overall. However, there wasn‚Äôt anything particularly special about this movie theater it was just okay. A decent choice for a casual movie night.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113607140413131397124/reviews
Sidney Lock,3,Came here to watch Gundam GQuuuuuuX but spoilt by crazy people who shout & scream everytime Gundam appears. Its ok to be a fan but this obsessive disruptive behaviour is too much to bear!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108532352166799061008/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,"Have been watching movies at Golden Village Plaza Singapura since I was a kid, and decades later I am still enjoying movies here! üé• The staff are always cheerful and friendly. Shoutout to the cleaners also who work so hard after every show, let‚Äôs make things easier for them by binning our own rubbish. The pictures and audio in each cinema are great too. Always a wonderful experience, thanks! üôèüèª",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
nayk,1,"had a movie at hall 4, the picture quality is so bad it's embarrassing. horrendous low brightness and really bad black level, overall terrible contrast and visibility, like an 8-year-old TV. it feels like reading a book in a room without lights at sunset hour - it is pure torture. if i had come alone, i would've walked out within the first 5 minutes. maybe this is their intended standard and quality? LOL.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112145148773062040015/reviews
