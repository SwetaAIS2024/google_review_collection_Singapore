It is as if the chef forgot about this pot and burnt the curry and the ladies finger inside. Pretty unpleasant burnt taste throughout. And I arrived after 2pm, not like they were super crowded. Not coming to eat their fish head curry anymore.",

      "text": "Just had dinner here on the weekend. We ordered to serve 9 pax and I must say that most orders only need to be medium in size. We also choose more dishes so that everyone could try out the different dishes. The curry fish head was my favourite of all the dishes. Sambal mixed vegetables was another highlight. Marmite chicken is a great choice for kids since itâ€™s boneless. Har Cheong Chicken was pretty good. The other dishes were quite in line with most stalls. Considering a weekend, we did not wait too long for our food. This may not be the best zichar around but itâ€™s certainly one that I will revisit for its convenience and value.",
