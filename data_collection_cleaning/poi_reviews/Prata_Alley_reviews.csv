äº¦æ³“,4,"The service is super exceptional. Swift, courteous and classy, look at how they lay out the table for me!!

Otherwise prata wise is not what i was expecting. It still needs a lot of improvement, fine tuning to be better than prata master next door. A little too doughy for my liking and is unable to retain and maintian its temperature despite order to make fresh. Kwa curry is good though, it should go well with chapati too, i see the other tables were all eating thosai, prolly something to try when one visits. Good ambience, doesnt feel like a prata place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115530236241481136259/reviews
Nadirah Razak,5,"Ever since I discovered Prata Alley at Alexandra Central, I've been coming her a fair number of times (I work nearby). Thosai had never disappointed me (especially ghee thosai omg). Briyani was incredible. Prata was crispy as requested. I almost ordered a third piece but too full. Mutton curry was good. Mutton pieces tender and flavourful. The only thing I didn't enjoy was mutton soup because the pieces got stuck in my teeth but that's not their fault. I just don't have enough teeth so I couldn't chew properly.

The best thing is, no matter how busy or quiet it is, owner/manager is always thoughtful and patient. It's so wholesome to witness little interactions between him and the children that come with their parents. This is a nice place. Please don't ever change.

Amber,5,"Amazing, clean and yummy food. Great service as well. My favorite is lamb shank briyani which is a HUGE portion, but they donâ€™t have it everyday depending on availability. They can also cook prata with olive oil for a healthier option for additional $0.50.
Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food.

KYL,5,"Ordered the chicken briyani, it was great. However, the portion was rather large, I recommend sharing a serving between 2 people. Unless you have a huge appetite.

I think their service is hands down the best I've had, one that can be given 5 stars with full confidence. Unlike the Master Prata nearby, the staff here are extremely attentive and polite.

The majority of people that find the food here not to their taste probably have a preference for heavier and stronger tastes. Personally I find it just nice.

The shop is very clean with no overly loud music or stains on the table/utensils/plates. It was a great experience, I'll be visiting again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116479241546919560283/reviews
Snoop Ee,5,Had a good time here with friends. The food was yummy. Had mutton murtabak and masala thosai. Generous portion and flavourful  food. The Teh Tarik was not too sweet and nice.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117540808388622978655/reviews
