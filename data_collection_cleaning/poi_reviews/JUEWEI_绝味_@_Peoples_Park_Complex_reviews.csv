Dancy He,1,"This is the worst experience I ever had in Singapore, while I considered myself as “frequent visitor” to Singapore.
I was born in China but family migrant to Australian.

Tonight I brought my Indian friend from Australia and her 8 years old kid to Chinatown Singapore, the kid wants to eat Chinese dumplings so we stopped in front of this shop. I ordered the dumplings for the kid with $5 payment, after that I was waiting in front of the counter. There are 3 Chinese men working in the kitchen however none of them cooking our order. After 10 minutes later I spoke Chinese to one of them and I got the answer was “I call you when it’s ready”, I told him I’m standing in front of your counter and clearly can see you are not cooking my orders, while there’s no one else ordering or waiting... Then he said, it takes time, I asked how long, he said 8 minutes; then I told him I’ve waiting here for more than 10 minutes.

Suddenly, there was another Chinese man just opened the cashier and put $5 in front of me, said: you like it to wait or you can go away.
I was totally shocked!

My Indian friend saw this and she came into the shop asked me what’s happening? I told her in English as that’s the only language we communicate, then the Chinese guy yelled out to me in Chinese: speak human language!
I then spoke to him back, here is Singapore and people understands English perfectly!

Now the 3rd person showed up, he seems like a Singaporean who understands English, he tried to explain to me the dumplings need to defreeze and it takes time - I really not care about how they cook their food but it’s their racist attitude concerns.

I have no idea how Singapore government or Chinatown association allow this kind of rude and discrimination exists, this is absolutely not  tolerated!!!

I will reported to related association and hopefully these Chinese men get some basic culture education, before trading in Singapore such multi-culture beautiful country.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100461340972616318260/reviews
