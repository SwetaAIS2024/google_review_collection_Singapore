Today, my first encounter with the new doctor. All was going great however when I shared my concerns towards the end, the doctor got frustrated suddenly, pressed hard on her keyboard and gave out a sigh. üòî",

      "text": "Dr Chua is caring and takes time to properly understand my concern. She even explained why my condition could have occurred and how I could prevent it from happening again in the future. Very calm and soothing.\n\nHowever I cannot say the same for the 2 ladies at the counter. I was the only one in the clinic but both appeared like they cannot be bothered with me which is fine but the most amusing thing is they gave me my medication and I left without paying. I only realized I didn‚Äôt make payment after a good 5 minutes when I was almost reaching my office. I rushed back to the clinic and both didn‚Äôt even look up (again, empty clinic). I went to the counter and said I think I forgot to make payment. Then they very calmly check the system and were like, oh yeah, it‚Äôs $xxx how will you be paying? So absurd. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt even give a damn about whether patients paid. I wonder how they do their accounting.",
