s !,1,"isn‚Äôt a school a place for students to make mistakes, then learn and grow from them? juying is definitely not a place for that. throughout my 4 years there, the system only got worse. the discipline team, particularly ms amanda, ms amy yeo, ms elydia honestly should not be given such a high position in any school. they literally have problems with EVERY small thing. student council has become basically a hell for students and so many have already been kicked out because of minor issues that they take so seriously. yes it‚Äôs to better improve the schools standards but i rly don‚Äôt think it needs to be taken this far. ms amanda has serious favouritism issues, unreasonable and lack of empathy. ms amy yeo literally glares at every student and picks on every small thing. who does she think she is‚Ä¶. do students need to be wary of their every move? she also gave me such a bad experience on the day i collected my o level results which is after i graduated so why does she care so much?? the teacher system is this school seriously needs to improve. a huge thank you to the understanding and actually good teachers, mr soh (science teacher), mdm mani, dr tan, ms wahidah, ms yee, mr martin, mrs wong, mr choong, mdm mas, mdm lian and a couple more. instead of the ex principal, mdm soh getting angry at students during morning assembly because she received a little complain from outsiders because of one grp of noisy JYians, they should read these reviews and make some improvements instead. so it‚Äôs okay if teachers mess up but not students?? please lah",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114100339611466318718/reviews
Queenie Cheng,5,"I‚Äôm glad my child who scored 13 points for her PSLE 2024 has entered JuYing Sec. Every school has their pros and cons. The school is massive, clean and well facilitated. Most of the Kids are dressed properly and behave reasonably well. Teachers and staffs are nice and helpful. Moreover, the school used to be Jurong Institute and close to NTU.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110037706690566138700/reviews
