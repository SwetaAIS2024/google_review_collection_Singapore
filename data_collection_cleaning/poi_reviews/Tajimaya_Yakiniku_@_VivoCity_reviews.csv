Gaius Leong,3,"MISLEADING. They advertise a deluxe set menu but there is no T&C stating it applies only for lunch, not dinner, on the printed menu.

There was no server at the front to address any customers despite it being a Thursday night, the restaurant was half empty, and us having a booking.

In the end, we had to order the buffet for 5 pax. It was good but we came here for the deluxe set initially, and we're slightly disappointed at being misled.

The male manager server had a dour look the whole time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114489108093874269886/reviews
Kyle Ng Heng Khai,5,The premium buffet was delicious and well worth the money. Really nice wagyu charcoal bbq. The garlic fried rice goes well with the meats too. The place was also very nice. Recommended.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116674306253055128761/reviews

em tan,4,Chosen regular buffet meal. So far I feel itâ€™s pretty good. Food taste pretty fresh. We have changed about metal grill 3 times but the staff was pretty okay with it. The garlic rice was quite nice flavourful. Few things is it would be great the BBQ tongs could be longer. Noted there is time limit but felt that abit rushed by the staff.. as still have food on plate but was asking to clear the table.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114032444857639752833/reviews
Kendrick Wee,5,Five star for service. Food was average. Teriyaki chicken was good. Rest of the meat were about tough. Shiitake mushroom was the best vegetable dish. Both salmon and swordfish were pretty good but important not to over cook them.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793547912532718349/reviews
