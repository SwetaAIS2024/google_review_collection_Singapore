Eve C,4,"Post Review Update:
I am heartened to know that Safra Tampines Management takes proactive actions against reviews and feedback. They have responded to me and will step up on their cleanliness. Glad to give them a try again in the near future.

Rented their bbq pit. Disappointed the pit wasn't clean properly with greases on the floor. Managed to get cleaner to clean up before using. They have grill and bbq but their grills is super dirty. I don't even consider using.
The door to the pit is faulty. Hard to open. Signage that one side is faulty only paste indoor but outdoor side not pasted. People thought it was locked.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,"Had an enjoyable experience at SAFRA Tampines this morning, for a combined location run alongside various SAFRA Running Club members that brought us to Bedok Reservoir Park and back. The facilities are great here, especially the Theatrette perfect for talks and engagements. All staff are helpful and professional. The showers and toilets are clean too. Ample carpark space when we arrived in the morning too. Thank you! üôèüèª",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews

Ang Laychian,5,Very nice view from the open top of the bus. The reservoir on the tampines side is visible.  The bus is in very good conditions with very nice cool air. Good experience. Will definitely come again with my daughter.  Thanks,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111041360722581862915/reviews
