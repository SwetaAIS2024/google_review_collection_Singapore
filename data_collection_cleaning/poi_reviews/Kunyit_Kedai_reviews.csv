Yapsheng Cheng,1,"From more than 10 times a month to 10 times a year... Today I ordered a plate of kueyteoh noodles and found a big fly in it after eating a little.. I will never go to this restaurant again. The food is getting worse and worse. Most of the food is salty. The service is getting worse and worse. The food is also dirty.

Please close the shop n Let other companies run it
This is the road I pass every day when I want to have breakfast, but I will not go there as long as it is run by this company because the food is really bad and dirty, and the service is not good!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116874184770081725861/reviews
Ke Li,1,"The food taste worst and the prices are high! A bottle of plain water is sold at 1.8 Singapore dollars in this shady store, while the same water is only 0.4 in the nearby supermarket. Even if the prices are high, that's fine, but the attitude of this waitress is extremely bad. There are several stalls in the store. Seeing that there was no one at her stall, I went over to buy water. She shouted at me, ""Can't you see there are many people queuing?"" There were only two people in front of the stalls next to her, and her stall was empty. She was very impolite and shouted at the customers! I will go to Facebook, red book, and IG to publicize the bad service of your store! I will never come here again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107853563851786143006/reviews

Charine S,1,"I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, it didn’t live up to expectations. The Chinese aunty at the counter was not friendly at all — no smile or warmth, just a very cold interaction. When I paid, she returned my change in loose coins, and even knocked on the table in a rather off-putting manner.

As for the food, the fried noodles were a big disappointment. They were very dry and tasteless, lacking the flavor and freshness you’d expect. Overall, the experience was pretty unwelcoming and underwhelming. I won’t be returning.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106134387919168106191/reviews
