The amount of hard work and meticulous planning gone is visible. So many different  kinds of gems, their life cycle  stages, where they are found etc. The staff is helpful and shows you around the place.  We had planned to spend an hour and ended up spending more than 2 hours. There was an activity for our kid of breaking a rock which was fun. We also bought a pair of earrings of raw amethyst (which u won't find at a normal jeweller).\n\nThe museum is privately owned and we were fortunate to meet the owner Mr Tay Thye Sun, who is a renowned world famous geologist and a professor. He showed us the lab and the training area which was a bonus. The excitement and passion in him about gems is visible even at this age.  He informed  that the museum is his son's idea and he is a technocrat at heart.\n\nThe place is closed on Sundays and Mondays and opens late at 12. While the admission is free you have to call them and book in advance as it's a house converted into a museum. It's near Rochor MRT station. If u book Grab it takes u to the old place ( they have moved). The place is a must visit in your Singapore itinerary."", 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': ""This place was the highlight of our visit to Singapore. My family simply loved it.
