Janette He,5,"Colleagues loved the kueh so much, it looks so pretty and presentable. Not only that, it taste great too! My 2nd platter purchase, first was for customer and great comments from them as these are so nostalgic! Thank you, Yummy Times for acceding to my requests of having them to be cut into smaller pcs too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112611486873209149805/reviews
Jacob TAN,4,"Bought the curry chicken with blue pea rice.
One whole chicken thigh which was tender and flavourful. Good coconut taste and curry sauce is robust but not overly spicy. The texture of the blue pea rice is just right and the flavour of the rice is nice. It is kind of like nasi lemak.
Will try the other chicken rice the next time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
Ming,4,Glutinous rice at $2 per pack. Pretty good. The sesame ball with peanut filling was not so nice. The dough was too thick.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109226628464118431877/reviews
Daniel Sin,4,"New stall at Lorong 1 block 125 coffee shop that sells Nonya dishes.  I have ordered Fragrant Steam Glutinous Rice 咸味糯米饭 which I found quite nice with plenty of ingredients, while the 香香饭菜 (Fan Choy) is just average because of the rice does not absorb the flavor of the meats and eggs. The white bee hoon is quite bland andee siam is not bad but the chilli is really spicy. I will definitely come back up try their other Nonya dishes.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112598854240446452449/reviews
T Aries,5,"I bought the dry mee siam, nasi lemak and curry chicken rice, all the food are delicious, can taste its cook from the heart and owner are very friendly too, i requested for the chilli to be separated and they did for all my food.
Will definitely order again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107033383189916414494/reviews
