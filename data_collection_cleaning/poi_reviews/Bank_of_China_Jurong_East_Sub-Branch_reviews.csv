Felicia,1,"Be prepared to spend your whole afternoon here waiting for the queue, so bring along your phone, books, crochet, etc to keep you occupied and avoid getting annoyed by the slow counter service. Also, don’t bother to approach the security guard as he is very likely to disappoint you. However, he is very competent in helping you become more independent in the bank, “Get your own queue number”, “Check the queue number on the screen yourself”.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113484989411294971703/reviews
Jonas Y,1,"Very disappointed in BOC, ever since BOC closed their Jurong Point branch, the nearest BOC branch is at Westgate Jurong East. Today, I waited for over 2 hours and it was nowhere near my turn. I feel that BOC is really inefficient and really taking their customers for granted. How can they expect their customers to wait for several hours just to wait for their turn? Additionally, the staff is very impatient and rude, asking me to go over to one side instead of helping me. I felt that they should have staggered their lunch time from 11am-2pm in order not to affect ops instead of going for lunch break together, which increased the waiting time.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103805346813917070158/reviews
Celene Ng,1,"Had a disappointing experience at Bank of China’s West Gate branch. Took a queue number (5xxx) and waited for almost an hour, only to find out—after checking in with the counter—that they do not provide HDB housing loans. Worse still, my number wouldn’t have been called anyway because the loan officer wasn’t even around. This could have been communicated upfront instead of wasting my time. The bank should have clearer service information and someone stationed at the queue system area to guide customers properly. There was also no apologies from the counter staff for taking up my time. Poor service and lack of efficiency.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102819611908404306381/reviews
Hidden Xu,1,I arrived 1030am in the morning when the bank just open but waited until 1230pm still not my turn. I only want to open a saving account. The couple just before me spend more than 1.5 hours on the counter. Super low efficiency and no estimated waiting time. I left with hungry and disappointment.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113565508176340322787/reviews
Chua Lim Pin,1,"Arrived at 1.50pm when the closing time is 4pm as it is a Saturday but the bank has already stopped issuing queue numbers as they have too many customers. It is ridiculous as the closing time is 4pm and I arrived more than 2h before the closing time yet I was told to either go to another branch or to return another day. I wasted my time and transport fare going all the way there for nothing.
My past experience at this branch has also not been great, always having to wait for a very long time, more than 1.5h before being served. I think the bank should seriously trained their staff to increase their productivity.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113115548186612331662/reviews
