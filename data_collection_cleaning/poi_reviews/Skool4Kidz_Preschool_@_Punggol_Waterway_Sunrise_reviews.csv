Mee Soto,5,"First and foremost, you can see the excellent skills of how the principal, Ms Qynn, ran the school well. Both my kids transition well from the mega centre to this school. Our experience with the mega centre was a very bad one. We have never spoken to the previous principal and all she does is sit in the office. But for this school, Ms qynn is very grounded and I see her often engaging the kids and parents. All the centre teachers are also proactive and patient. Would like to give a shout out to teacher tin, ruiting laoshi, liya laoshi, teacher anne, teacher hema, teacher Eileen, and fang laoshi for being my kids best educators and safe space for my kids to grow and learn. If I could keep my kids in this school, I would till they reach secondary school. We love this school overall and it has been a pleasant experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110322685535264950096/reviews

Karen Yeow,5,"There are several schools around the vicinity and I was impressed with the Principal walking through me on the school facilities and programmes during their open house. It was a 1-1 interaction and I could feel the effort she put in and not rushing through things.

True enough I am further impressed with the teachers professionalism which makes my sons felt welcomed to the school. They look forward to school and could share with us what they learnt. They became more vocal and they are more willing to converse in Mandarin. Big shout out to Teacher Tin and Ruiting laoshi for bringing joy to the kids in school!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113548120598532676005/reviews
