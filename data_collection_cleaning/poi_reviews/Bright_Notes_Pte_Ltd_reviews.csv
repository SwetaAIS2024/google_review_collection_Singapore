Isabelle Sim,5,"Ms Sharon is an excellent piano teacher, probably the best I've had so far in my 15-year music journey. As a grade 8 student, she pushes me to master pieces to a high level of technicality and musicality. I often feel like I'm receiving conservatory-level lessons every week! She demonstrates the Grade 8 pieces for me with proper technique and allows me to record it so I can practice at home. With this, Iâ€™m able to overcome difficult passages at home. After class, we engage in musical exploration where we take a look at other pieces outside the syllabus, and she is more than happy to play them for me. Ms Sharon has the capacity to teach students of all ages, from toddlers to young adults like myself. She is patient and kind, and I would highly recommend her as a piano teacher.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112318781754636805554/reviews
Fui Keat Yee,5,"Teacher Sharon coached my daughter in piano from primary 2 through to lower secondary. What sets teacher Sharon apart from other music teachers I know is her focus on the learning process, not just the outcomes or exam results. She caters to the unique needs of individual students to work on their weaknesses and build on their strengths. Teacher Sharon imbued in my daughter the values of perseverance , resilience, self discipline and accountability in the face of challenges. Teacher Sharon takes every teachable moment during lessons to inculcate the necessary values and attitudes, apart from music skills. I credit teacher Sharon for contributing to my daughter's character development through music training.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109085910947881942121/reviews
