Eugene Khoo,5,"The epitome of a super local joint. Super chill vibes and the food is excellent, not your usual cheap bar bites. Great for a casual date, family, or with friends, and even just for a solo beer. Staff are super chill and friendly. A great standout in this otherwise quite dull neighbourhood. 10/10 would recommend. Pet friendly as well!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111771572506435380549/reviews

Jerico Lee,5,"Legit all the food we ordered were delicious.
Tried 2 of the beers on tap, they were ok but not great. The atmosphere and the really good food make it overall really solid. Hope they find another place to lease as they are closing soon at serene center.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101340194757959390412/reviews
