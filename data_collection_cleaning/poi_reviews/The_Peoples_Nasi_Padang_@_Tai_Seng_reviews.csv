Sean Goh,4,"Chance upon this nasi Padang stall in the Tai Seng industrial area while running some errands in the area. This stall not only sells nasi Padang but also yakiniku Japaneses bbq.  I was there around 11.45am,just before the lunch crowd. There was no queue, and I was able to order immediately. Huge variety in terms of dish selections.

Order 2 different veg and a fried chicken, the meal cost me SGD$5.50. Fried chicken was not well seasoned, it was super crispy and wasn't oily at all. The eggplant and vegetable dishes were decent, pretty similar to what you get from other stalls.

Overall, the nasi Padang is definitely above average and, most importantly, reasonable pricing. I would likely recommend and return myself again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Robin CHAN,5,"Reasonable priced Nasi Padang stall in an industrial building ( parking in the building is not cheap so try to park at the URA public car park along the road).

This food stall is an extension from a well known restaurant.

Friendly staff and great variety.

Lunch service is quite crowded so go early if you want your variety and choice. Nasi Padang stall closes at 3pm.

Evening serves BBQ beef, which I didn‚Äôt try.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110844727029880730536/reviews
William Lu,5,"Their nasi padang was good and reasonable price. Ordered one fried chicken (without bones) and two sides - sambal goreng and bitter gourd, it was $6. Accept paynow here.

It was a long queue when I ordered. I think always long queue on lunch hour though.

There was a customer complained that the fried chicken was not up to expectations (it wasn't the taste but the portion it seemed) when I was about to pay, they offered a refund or a replacement on the chicken. Good service üëç",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
Chakra HM,5,"Was my first time at Print Hub and tried the Nasi Padang for lunch. The food was very delicious, fried fish was very fresh as well as the rest. Good to go for more visits to this place",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106043624419082368472/reviews
