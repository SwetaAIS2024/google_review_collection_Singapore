They also have a great variety of side dishes like the bakwan, fried ngo Hiang and stuffed beancurd. Customers can also request for Nasi Kuning (with a 50 cents charge). It's easily accessible by MRT, just take the MRT to Kovan and take Exit C to Heartlands Mall. Definitely will be back again.",

Ordered via QR code and the food is served very quickly.\n\nOrdered the curry fish head, egg. Chap cai and beef rendang. Portion is just nice for small eaters. Favourite dish was the beef rendang and fish head. Ordered dessert after. chendol and gula meleka sago which was OK . Price is considered decent.\n\nRecommended to try if you are around the area.",

I recommend going on the weekdays as there are the lunch sets that are worth the value. The assam fish, chye poh omelette are the must try dishes, and if you're having the lunch set, it's the duck soup, chap chye, ngoh hiang, bean curd and ayam buah keluak. Really recommend for you guys to try it!",
