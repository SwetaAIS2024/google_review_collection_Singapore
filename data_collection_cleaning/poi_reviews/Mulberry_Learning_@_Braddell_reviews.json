      "text": "My child has been at Mulberry Braddell for four months, and it has been a fantastic journey! We transferred from another school, and he adapted incredibly quickly—he absolutely looks forward to school every day!\n\nThe teachers at check-in are professional and proactive, always stepping out happily to welcome the children. This reflects how well-staffed and caring the team is. My child also bonded with his teachers and friends very quickly and has never once said he doesn’t want to go to school.\n\nWe’re truly grateful for the care and support from MBR. A special thank you to Principal Ms. Fornia, who is highly professional and goes above and beyond to support parents in their journey. Thank you, Ms. Fornia, and the entire team at MBR!",

The teachers have been with the school long-term, which speaks volumes about the environment. My kids love their teachers, and the principal is proactive and involved. The school also organizes many activities that engage both parents and children, fostering a strong community. Plus, it helps that this is an HQ-managed school rather than a franchise. No regrets putting my girls here—highly recommended!",

      "text": "Our child was well-taken care of since he attended Mulberry's Infant Care at 4 months old. Teachers kept us updated via the Mulberry app with photos and messages, letting us know activities our child has been engaged in, such as baby spa.\n\nThe transition to PN was calibrated, spending a few hours at PN each day, before moving over fully.\n\nPN was filled with activities such as arts and crafts, Habits of Mind training  and Chinese lessons. The curriculum is quite holistic and beneficial for the children under their care.\n\nThe experience has been excellent, and our child's keen interest in going to school is a testament to Mulberry's teachers and curriculum.",
