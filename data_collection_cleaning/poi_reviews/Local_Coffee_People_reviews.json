      "text": "Super bad customer service and the drinks is really awful and disgusting?\nWanted to give the salted lychee tea a try and asked if the staff if the drinks is carbonated. But the first staff couldn’t answer me and I asked the 2nd staff whom also cannot answer me if the drinks is fizzy/carbonated. They had to ask another staff further in and they say it wasn’t. When I got my drink I was shocked because it looks like lemonade. And I was right because it just tasted like a salty lemonade?! I went back and checked with the staff and he just told me to stir. I stirred thoroughly right infront of him and tasted again it’s the same. And he just walked off. The rest of the staff also didn’t bother trying to remake or change the drink for me. They use their super eye p wer as if they are of any help. Outright disgusted by their rudeness and unprofessionalism. There are so many drinks places in Raffles Place and they had the audacity to provide such standard and service.",
