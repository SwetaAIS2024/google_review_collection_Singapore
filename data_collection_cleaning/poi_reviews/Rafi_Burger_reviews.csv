Homebased Burger Stall at Kota Iskandar, Iskandar Puteri, Gelang Patah, (Tanjung Kupang)

You should try their chiken chop, it served with nice homemade blackpaper sauce.

Then relax your self with a cup of Flavored Coffe. Sure will bring you up to other level.

They also serve Nice Street Burger. You should try.
