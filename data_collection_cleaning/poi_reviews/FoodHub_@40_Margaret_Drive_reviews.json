      "text": "New food court with nice colourful wallpaper & neon signs. The fish head steamboat was good but too pricey , $31.80 for a small portion suitable for two. There were only a few pieces of fish without much meat. The good thing was the soup was tasty & flavourful, they offer refill of soup. The kangkong belachan was good but charging $10 at a hdb food court is on the high side. Other stalls were Teochew fishball noodles, BBQ roasted duck & pork, Chinese ramen & dumpling, vegetarian mala hot pot, Malay stall & western food stall.",

I'm really impressed by the cleanliness, the systematic and order of purchasing foods, and variety of food they sell at most of the hours.\n\nIt comes with the \"budget meal\" if you would like to save a few bucks.\n\nI have tried their laksa, fishball noodle, tri-platter chiken rice, and loh mee. So far so good..nothing to comment about.",

      "text": "Please order with care when come to buying stuffs from the Economy Rice Store. It is always good to check the price of each dish before letting the server place it on your plate.\n\nI ordered sliced potatoes, fried tofu, and steamed egg, and it costs S$4.10. Except for the tofu, each serving portion for the other two items does not even fill my palm when I cupped it.\n\nThey determine the steamed egg as a meat product and charge a premium price, since there is minced meat in it. But, this is really cheating and profiteering; the ratio of meat to egg is like 1:10. This is a horrible tactics to charge more at the expense of people buying from this store. For business ethics, I am deducting 1 point from the overall score.\n\nOn the taste front, it is acceptable, but nothing to scream about. The food is ordinary. 3 points.\n\nI don’t expect good service from an Economy Rice Store, but when the serving staff talks down to the customer, especially when the price of the dishes are queried: a point is deducted from the overall score.\n\nOverall, I am giving this store 1 point (3 points for taste - 1 point for service - 1 point for business ethics).\n\nI don’t recommend this store. Use you S$4.10 elsewhere.",

      "text": "ate here the other day and my gf tell the aunty to take away their dumplings (6 pieces for $4.50), so we paid. but when we left we forgot about to take the dumplings. we went to ask the aunty about it the next day and she claims that she did not know anything about the dumplings. when we asked the next day there was another man stating that he will help us fry the dumplings and give to us but the aunty directly said no. Like that is so sus, when she left didn't she realise there was dumplings?? like where is the integrity?!\nSo glad I did not order $50 worth of dumplings :')\n\nOverall the food at this FoodHub is not bad but just be careful when you take away the food from the stall that is in the photo attached.",
