m n,1,"Bedok North MRT station. Horrible experience. Accidentally left my phone and wallet with my friend and she tapped out first. Could not call out to her as she walked off and hence, could not get out as I couldnâ€™t tap out and my form of communication was also not with me. Staff had the audacity to comment a very rude and disrespectful remark. This happened on the 26th of March 2025 around 12AM. If as a service worker you have no compassion for your people, why even serve? It was an accident. Not on purpose. Nobody is out to make your life harder for you, please check yourself first before making any sort of comments. Disgusting behaviour from SBS staff. Would give 0 stars if I could.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107260010590084381409/reviews
SAAziz S M,4,"It's one of the deepest mrt station. Might be as deep as newton. I like the spaciousness and the long flight of escalator up to the exit. The view outside is also nice and spacious. At exit B, you can see a mosque nearby. Liked the view inside and outside as we seldom come here.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117697808727089801385/reviews

Agnes Tan,5,Conveniently located between Blocks 620 and 621. Short walking distance from bus stop located at Bedok Church of Christ. MRT ride from Bedok North to Tampines is less than ten mins. And ride to Telok Ayer is about 30 minutes. Awesome!,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116016553997055176417/reviews
Ash,5,"Very nice material design style, simple floor plan. One thing I appreciate is how simple the station floor plan and design is - the three exits have large and clear signs labelling them, the toilets are easily found and the four card top-up machines ensure there will not be any annoying waits during peak hours. The beauty in simplicity concept carries forward to the exits as well, which are all beautifully designed, have lifts, and look nice when viewed from a nearby HDB flat",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111164444158949376534/reviews
