Sean Goh,3,"One of the few stalls inside the 50A Marine Terrace Market and food centre that operate till late evening. Basically they are a zhichar stall operating inside a hawker centre. The menu list is pretty extensive for such a small stall.

Ordered a total of 4 dishes, Portion was consider quite generous but the food was a little too salty for our liking.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
