Ice Qu,5,"They do have one of the best selections of ink pens anywhere, I will give them that! I always stop in at Evergreen for my faves and to see what else they might have to tempt me.
This shop is where you'll find lined hardbound notebooks (several sizes and in different cover designs) ready to fill with your words or scribbles. You'll find envelopes, folders, pencils, some paints, papers of all kinds, stickers, wrapping paper sheets and more.
The only unpleasantness is that the shop is very compact and aisles are so narrow they practically don't exist, but I guess that's what's good too, as they can pack a ton of stuff in a small space.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112472682452415767759/reviews
