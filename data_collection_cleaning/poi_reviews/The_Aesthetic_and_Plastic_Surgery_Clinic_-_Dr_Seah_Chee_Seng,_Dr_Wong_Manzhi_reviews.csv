Misao,5,"Dr. Wong Manzhi is very meticulous with her work, she operated on my mother’s breast after tumor removal. The stitches she’s done was very tidy and heals properly. She was recommended by our cancer doctor and shows amazing results. Dr. Wong also cares a lot about her patients and always make sure to respond fast whenever we need her assistance through Whatsapp.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107428002043962968153/reviews

First impression is oh whoa, Dr Wong look stern, suprisingly, she is pretty patience and explained in details what are the options that I have and the pros n cons depending on which type of recon i choose. After the ops, the following ups with her proved her professionalisim n caring beyond her capacilty. Dr Wong is the 2nd doc that I had seen and after consultation with her, initially,
I felt at ease with her and decided to go for the recon with her though initially I am unable to decide on whether I want or not.

Alexia Choo,5,"I am thankful to have Dr Wong support during my mastectomy and breast reconstruction journey. I still recall my first visit with her - she spent a long time to explain to me all about reconstruction and the options I had to fill up the breast, this allowed me to make a well informed decision. Her medical expertise are top-notch and she really spends a lot of time on her patients. Thank you dr Wong again and see u next time!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101522810605472785440/reviews
