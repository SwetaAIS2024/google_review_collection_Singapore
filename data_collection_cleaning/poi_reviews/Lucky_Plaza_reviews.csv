yamuna mohanram,4,"Lucky plaza is quite an interesting mall. It has a few grocery shops that sell products from Philippines, beauty salons, money exchange, employment agencies, clothing and foot ware stores. Lots of busy eateries especially Indonesian restaurants that are packed around lunch time. One snack shop that had a long line- serving desserts (cash only though) and another that had fried hot food, both are stand alone shops that aren't part of the food court. Floors are all accessible through escalators and elevators. If you are looking for snacks and food items from the Philippines then this is probably the place to go to.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102396677643961543131/reviews
Vic Mayor,4,"When we would go to Singapore in the Late 80s/ Early 90s we would always visit this Mall. It has not changed much and now has a number of Philippine Food Stores like Andok's, Jolibee, Tapa King. Lots of Filipinos here, specially during Sundays so it will feel like home.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100726652297386761725/reviews
Nancy Cheong,5,"For the price conscious bargain hunters at Orchard road: Lucky Plaza has lower to mid-range options. On the higher floors there are thrift stores selling gently used clothings. Don't forget the small food court on the top floor. Also an interesting selection of Filipino shops, eateries and bakery serving authentic Filipino bakes and desserts.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115009846014388742332/reviews
Vishal Shivapujimath,4,"Lucky Plaza is a bustling and iconic destination in Singapore, known for its affordable shopping and vibrant atmosphere. Located right in the heart of Orchard Road, it’s a favorite spot for both locals and tourists looking for great deals and unique finds.

The mall is a treasure trove of bargains, offering a wide range of products, from clothing and accessories to electronics, perfumes, and souvenirs. If you’re on a budget but still want to shop, this is the place to be. You can also find money changers with competitive rates and travel agencies offering budget-friendly packages.

One of the highlights of Lucky Plaza is its amazing selection of Filipino stores and eateries. For those craving authentic Filipino dishes, this is the ultimate go-to spot. From adobo and sinigang to freshly baked pandesal, the food here is both delicious and affordable, making it a home away from home for many.

Though the mall is not as glitzy as some of the newer shopping centers in Orchard, its charm lies in its authentic and lively atmosphere. The crowd adds to the energy, and the friendly vendors are always ready to assist.

Lucky Plaza is especially ideal for those seeking a more down-to-earth shopping experience in the midst of Singapore’s upscale Orchard Road. Whether you’re looking for bargains, delicious food, or just want to experience a slice of local life, Lucky Plaza offers a unique and memorable visit.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116487253414127134871/reviews
