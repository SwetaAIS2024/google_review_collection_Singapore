Ian Heng,5,"Had a great meal at their Toa Payoh outlet, having a wide variety of options, including special uncommon items, maintaining its freshness for dinner. Fried items are re-fried for crispiness, separately serve from the wet items and noodles. Though the queue seems long, the service was actually prompt and staff well-mannered.
Had the laksa version, perfect for a rainy day. Bonus that the stall operates 24hrs!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109433312110942599622/reviews
