Tiffany Koh,5,"Had a hearty dinner here, all the dishes were delicious. 2 pax but we cleared all 4 dishes.

Particularly love the smelly beans, crunchy and fresh. I also saw that they did properly cleaning of the beans.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103364360492811481209/reviews
JC L,5,"My family’s go to spot for a good dinner. Friendly lady boss who remembers her customers. Food is exceptional, one of the best sambal stingrays around, oyster omelette always hits the spot too.

Good sized portions, fresh seafood, perfect for sharing as a family. I look forward to my next meal here!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111522302134421651292/reviews
Lim Wei Liang Jexus,5,"I recently indulged in a BBQ feast that left my taste buds delighted and my appetite thoroughly satisfied. The variety of dishes was impressive, offering something for everyone. However, the standout star of the meal was undoubtedly the stingray sambal—highly recommended for its perfect blend of flavors and spices. The tender, smoky stingray paired with the spicy, tangy sambal sauce was a match made in culinary heaven. If you're a BBQ enthusiast looking for a flavorful adventure, make sure to try the stingray sambal. It’s a must-try that will leave you craving more!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102308556891249638395/reviews

KM T,2,"I ordered the BBQ crayfish recently at their Jurong West stall, requested for more sambal but not a lot was given. The crayfish meat was kind of dry and very little. I even asked the lady taking the order if it was fresh, she said yes. I wouldn't say the meat was crunchy, definitely not the best I had ever tasted. 3 very small crayfish for $21, not worth the price in my opinion. Even I know with all the inflation going on. I had to order the 3 vegetable combinations in sambal after finishing the crayfish and my plain rice. Not filling! The veg saved the day. It was good. If only the crayfish tasted as good. The stall's lady staff who attended to me was polite and nice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108545563643707360073/reviews
