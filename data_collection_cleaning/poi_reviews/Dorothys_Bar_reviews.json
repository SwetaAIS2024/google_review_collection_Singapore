      "text": "I tried one of their cocktails called Dorothy’s Swing, one of the staff recommended it n honestly, not bad! Tasted pretty good, definitely not one of those \"what did I just drink\" moments. I also grabbed one of their postcards as a little souvenir because why not?\n\nThe entrance was easy to spot, but heads up: the place is a bit on the cramped side. Still, the vibe totally made up for it. Their playlist? Absolute bangers! Every song a crowd favorite, especially with the gays. The place erupted when Bad Romance blasted through the speakers. Pure chaos, pure joy. Only downside? They don't take song requests but honestly, their taste is so good, you probably wouldn’t need to anyway.",

      "text": "One of the hidden gems in Singapore’s nightlife! Dorothy’s Bar has such a warm and welcoming vibe, whether you’re a regular or a first-timer, the staff treat you like an old friend. Great drinks, decent prices, and a chill crowd that knows how to have fun without the drama. Love the mix of music and the cozy atmosphere, perfect for winding down or starting the night. Definitely a go-to if you’re looking for a laid-back, inclusive space to just be yourself. The crowd is super diverse mix of locals, expats, and travellers. Definitely try the Devil’s Island, it comes in different strength levels depending on how brave (or reckless) you’re feeling.\n\nOnly downside (or plus, if you’re eco-conscious) they serve paper straws. So drink fast or bring your own metal one.",
