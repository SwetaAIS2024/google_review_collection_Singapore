Wong Jasmine,5,"6 Jan 2025

I suffered back injury on my L1, L4 and L5 and was recommended to visit Physio & Sole Clinic (Kembangan) by my Orthopedic.

On my 1st visit, I was attended by Joshua, the physiotherapist, he quickly understood my condition and skillfully administered pressure point massage on my back thereafter taught me some stretching exercise to practice at home to build-up my core muscles.

After 3 consultations, I have regained confidence in my everyday chores and able to move at ease.

I wish to thank him for my speedy recovery and wish to recommend his services to anyone who needs.

Thank you very much.

Best regards,

Trev,1,"Had a great first experience here. Podiatrist was knowledgeable and taught me ways to alleviate my foot pain. I was scheduled for a followup 2 weeks later.

I enquired before my follow up if there was another charge of 180. Staff told me no charge of 180, but did not specify a follow charge price.

I felt misled to paying another 50 for follow up as the staff told me no charge of 180 and did not elaborate further. I will be not coming back due to lack of clear communication, no fault on the podiatrist.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118065945630839887939/reviews
