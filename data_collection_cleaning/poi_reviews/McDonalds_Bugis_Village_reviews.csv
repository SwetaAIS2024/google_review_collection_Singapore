McDonald's Bugis Village in Singapore is a convenient fast-food option located in a bustling shopping and tourist area.

McDonald's Bugis Village is a solid choice for a quick and familiar meal in a convenient location. However, if you're looking for a quieter, more spacious dining experience, you might prefer other McDonald's branches or nearby cafes.

Thank you, God Bless",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110561422577939376703/reviews
Xin Hao,4,"I love this outlet for the peace, cleanliness and efficient service, even during lunch hours, as compared to the one at Bugis Junction just 200m away. It’s much better option for me with sufficient seats and comfy enough spots to enjoy a dine-in meal. Staff are all very friendly and cheerful. My meal was prepared in less than 10mins during a peak hour and I could find seats. They also recently renovated the space so it’s definitely much spacious and also organized in a way.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101038177603319548234/reviews
Mel C,5,"We visited McDonald's at Bugis Village on 21 February 2025, at 1.45pm. When we entered the store, a waitstaff was assisting an elderly customer in front of us with the self-service kiosk. Even though we ordered self-collect, because there was a lot of food, a staff served our food to us. After we were done eating, she helped us clear our table and asked us how our experience was.

Our experience was fantastic. Even though the store was busy, we received our dine-in order quickly. Our dine-in experience was enjoyable. The seats were spaced far enough apart to where I didn't feel claustrophobic. Moreover, the seating area was clean and the pick-up counter, tidy.

We even made a couple special requests to our burgers, and all were fulfilled to the tee. The fries were prepared perfectly, not too soggy but also not too dry. I also liked the limited time Ovaltine McFlurry from the store. They served a generous portion of ice cream and mixed the crunch topping into the ice cream evenly.

Thank you to the staff at this McDonald's for making our day!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107652717523220457097/reviews
Sophia “Sophia Eve” Evan,1,"Service not satisfactory.
There is some rude or can't be brothered
It's like I have to go after staff for my order..
I dun go there to beg for food..
I went there to have some meal.
I pay...as a paying customer.
I really dunno how to say further..
Management has to train crew to learn to be vigilant and pay attention to customer
Or speak with good tone..and pleasant.

Customer has to wait at counter q sumetimes to ask order or need assistance in the kiosk.
I also work in service industry.
Never in my life hurt my customer..

Mystery shopper has to go to this outlet and observe the service.

I feel if we cannot serve customer in appropriate way like respect or respond to customer promptly, never say gd afternoon sir/mdm
...or if staff busy at least respond say sorry, nothing I hear..

One cannot be in service industry, if one dunno how to serve or bias with some race..
As we will hurt paying customer.
.....this will be my last trip to this outlet..
Macdonald is my favorite fastfood
After this experience, I dunno how to say further..",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113989203545315014118/reviews
Ferdiantono Lim,5,"I was shocked to arrive at a full house McDonald’s on a Friday around midnight—apparently, people here don’t really sleep! Despite the crowd, I managed to enjoy a super delicious McSpicy along with some sides and drinks. Singapore really does McSpicy better. Luckily, I was able to secure a spot to sit, which felt like a win in such a packed place!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117289056511151480296/reviews
