The plump ponytailed lady with Tattoos at the counter is extremely rude and arrogant! Attitude sucks big time, as though we customers owe her something! Totally do not recommend!",

Other stall owners were even looking at me. When she finally responded me she told me obviously its not open why cannot see myself need to keep asking. Is it very difficult to answer a simple yes or no? Didn't buy never going to again.",

      "text": "When you receive such horrible service, everything sucks. Everyone owe their staffs a living, such an horrific experience. I placed the menu on the lower table for easy reading and wanted to ask the lady something she raised her voice and demanded for me to put it on the top table for her to see. The request was fine however the tone and gesture was utterly uncalled for. And then another staff passed the food, I asked for belancan, she kept insisting there is (yeaa there was green chilli), reached out to her again, she took out the green chilli and put the belancan in errr? Like ask before swapping?So rudee!\nOh and, they say the ability of the chef is determined by how they cook their eggs? The yolk is totally smashed :)",
