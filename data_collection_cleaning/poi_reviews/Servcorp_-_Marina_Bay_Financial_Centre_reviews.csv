IN K,1,"Old aged place with menacing protocols and charges around helping you to open office door if you ever forgot keys and around space bookings as well as printings etc. All out to bite your head off with exorbitant rates and penalizing T&Cs. Always out of cups in pantry and no proper meeting systems, no conference phones in their meeting rooms, no proper display. Take your money and go elsewhere, plenty of options in the hood.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103683442972166179281/reviews

Seongmi Kang,1,Vague and blurry T&C. The worse part is the manager lady wasn't able to explain clearly. Or they donâ€™t mean to follow their own terms because they had no clue either. Be mindful.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106352627522181581279/reviews
