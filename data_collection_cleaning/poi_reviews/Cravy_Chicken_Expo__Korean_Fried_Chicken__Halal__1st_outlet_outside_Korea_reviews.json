It can get crowded during peak hours.\n\nHere's what I got!\n\n6 pieces boneless chicken chunks set\naffordable set that comes with a side of fries and a drink. Both the chicken and fries are very crispy. There are a few different choices for the drinks (coke, rootbeer, fanta, etc)\n\nRose rabokki had thick and creamy sauce. Comes with al dante noodles, chewy tteokbokki, sausages, and sliced ham. The sauce was a great pairing with everything elseü§§\n\nThe cheese balls are so cheesy and chewy.\n\nCurly fries are a must-order, so good!\n\nService is quite good. Overall a pretty good‚ò∫Ô∏è",

The fried chicken unlike other places we visited is perfectly seasoned not only on the outside but on the inside as well which makes this chicken dish one of our favourites.\n\nBesides the chicken, the Rabokki is soooo creamy and sooo packed with flavors and ingredients like Teokpokki, Sausages and ham slices.\n\nQuality food at affordable prices. Would definitely visit again to satisfy our fried chicken cravings!",
