A looknat the drink the color pale brown which seems like there is not enough chocolate is added and too much milk is added. Taste of the drink confirms that the enitre drink is tatseless.",

Staff too busy to step out.\n\nAmbiance (2/5)\nCramped dining area with narrow walkways.\nDiners get bumped by passers-by.\nOverall atmosphere lacks comfort and inviting feel.\n\nFood (4/5)\nDelicious donuts and autumn-themed drinks.\n\nOverall (3/5)\nDespite tasty treats, the lackluster service and ambiance disappointed.\nStaff seemed detached, and attention to detail was missing.\nHopefully, management will address these issues to match the quality of their food.",
