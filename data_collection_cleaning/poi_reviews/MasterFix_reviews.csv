J S.,1,Duplicated a couple of keys and were charged $4 each. Realised I was overcharged when my fam member told me they paid much lesser than what I paid at the same place but by different staff. No receipt given either. What a scam! Side income or profiting? Are the staff underpaid so they resort to doing this? Unless duplicating keys also have CNY surcharge. But it was a week after CNY ðŸ™ƒ,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110820042880078231103/reviews
Jacqueline Lee,1,Been here many times and their break time is always more than an hour. The boss should have at least 2 staff to cover break time. Photo taken at 3.32pm,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108451105456103210572/reviews
Hass Sunny,1,"Things hasn't changed a bit with this store especially with the older Chinese guy staff wearing glasses. Expect bad attitude and service. No greeting or what so ever. He can even raise his voice at you just to tell you to take out the items. I had 3 pairs that needs to be repaired but no thanks to such poor service. Once again, never again.  Masterfix administration needs to do a reality check on this staff.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109361365909165056898/reviews
Boon Aun,1,"Wasted time, effort and energy. I paid $25 to duplicate a metal gate key. The first copy couldn't even be inserted and the second while could enter the key hole, failed to turn. I was told that the success rate is only 60% and was given a refund. Subsequently, I visited Caeg Specialist at the basement of Beauty World, paid $15, took the newly minted key back and it worked like a charm. What the difference? Well, Caeg Specialist had a locksmith who used an electronic Vanier caliper to make precise measurements of the master key. She then selected the right key with precisely the exact dimensions and did a great job.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116432938245247803819/reviews
