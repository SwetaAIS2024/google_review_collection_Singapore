Lee Cathy,5,"I'm so happy to know that Chong Hoe has an outlet at Tampines.

I've been seeing Dr. Pansy a few years whenever I have health issues.  She is gentle and reliable.

Highly recommended üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107966077599329834173/reviews
Lee Irwin,5,"Excellent TCM at Tampines Grande! I have been plagued by rashes for the past 2 years and visited a number of western doctors including skin specialists and TCM but the condition did not improve and the rashes kept coming back. Then I was recommended to Chong Hoe Healthcare and decided to pay a visit and saw Dr James Chan. He was extremely patient and knowledgeable. He looked at my condition and explained to me in detail and let me know how he will be able to treat my condition.  Only a week past and my skin rashes was almost fully recovered and I can also sleep better at night. I will certainly continue to see Dr Chan for my overall wellness. Also, the clinic exudes a very calm and pleasant atmosphere.
Thank you, Dr James Chanüëç",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110207573302301047857/reviews
Nurhanan Farid,5,"Went to get a consultation and an acupuncture for my dad as he was experiencing shortness of breath and did not sleep as well. After the session, the physician Fang Ting, did a good job and gave us a lot of tips on how to help improve my dad's condition. Additionally, I opt for a cupping session and she also gave me advice and a list of ingredients I can purchase for my wellbeing. I truly appreciate the information and attentiveness by the physician and highly recommend this place. Will be back soon for both our next session! üòä",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103923845956245369577/reviews
Tan Shu Hua,5,"My husband and I have been seeing Physician Pansy when we were seeking for a reliable and friendly TCM, after we were married as we were trying to conceive. After her consistency and patience with good management of my health, I am expecting my baby.

Pansy's holistic way of managing our health through her prescribing of medicine, herbs, acupuncture, dietary advices and daily practices have significantly improved our body.

We were so happy to have her clinic outlet expanded to Tampines which is closer to our place, bringing more convenience to our family.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102500023726286247445/reviews
