Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for quality medical care with excellent support staff.",

He explained every step and made me comfortable as I am always anxious when comes to needles. I had both health screening and flu vaccination.\nHowever, the service by the counter staff (or receptionists, perhaps?) was unfortunately poor. Took some time for just one (of the four) of them to answer my query as all seemed to be engrossed with own work. I understand that they might have been busy but the reply was rude and crude.\nI was called back to return to the clinic as my waist-hip measurement was not taken when I was there earlier in the day. When I arrived, my measurements were taken right at the reception desk, in front of all the waiting patients. Hope the service by the counter staff could be improved. Mutual respect poster is plastered behind the counter and I am sure mutual respect works both ways.\nWhen I opened my report on the app, my height was entered wrongly! Makes me wonder if the whole report is even accurate.",
