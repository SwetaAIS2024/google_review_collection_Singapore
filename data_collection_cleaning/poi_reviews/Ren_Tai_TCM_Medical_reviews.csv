Eric Yam,5,"I suffered from trigger finger pain for almost six months and couldn’t find relief with other TCM treatments. However, when I found Dr. Yuen, she used acupuncture, and after just a few sessions, my trigger finger finally recovered. Dr. Yuen is highly skilled in massage, acupuncture, and Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Although she works alone and there can be a wait, it is well worth it for the quality of care she provides.

I highly recommend Dr. Yuen if you need any TCM treatment.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108860923502644234942/reviews
Natalie Ng Wan Ling,5,"Very good doctor. I had slipped disc and it couldn’t heal after 6months. I was seriously considering doing spine surgery but I decided to give acupuncture a try. Two acupunture  sessions on my back with doctor Yan and my slipped disc issue was solved in two weeks. It was truly a miracle. She is my go to doctor whenever my kids and I have physical issues since then. She is truly, 医者仁心，妙手回春。",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110774137061892472032/reviews
Ching Yann Yap,5,"Went for a painfully knee injury. Dr. Yan was very gentle, she did heating and massaging to loosen the knee area and adjusted it back to position. Did some ba Guan and after that felt relieved quite instantly. She was very patience and gave alot of  advice. Was told if the knee gets better then no need to come back for further treatment. Reasonable price and no hard sell.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104492660207476874569/reviews
Keo Chris,5,"Dr Yan was very patient and detailed in her diagnosis. Even when I reached clinic after closing hour, she will still attend to my needs. Once, I saw an old sick patient mistakenly walked into her clinic, she was kind to personally escot patient to the right clinic beside her unit.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102746917752972963098/reviews
