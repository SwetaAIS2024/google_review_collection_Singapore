yvonne chng,1,"My friends and I have breakfast here after our walk almost every week. I really don’t know why we continue coming here when the customer service is so poor. None of the staff has a pleasant disposition; they speak to customers in a very abrupt manner often with zero eye contact and sometimes even show impatience if they feel you are slow or unclear in placing your order. And as if it isn’t already the most expensive kaya toast eatery in Singapore (you can find kaya toast sets for $2-$3 less also in the city area; at the MBS foodcourt it costs $5.50), they charge 50 cents more if you request for extra butter on your toast (and only because the amount of butter on the toast is so little to begin with) (see photo for the miserable 50 cents worth of extra butter).",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111244933591572884862/reviews
Joni F.,4,"Same quality of your usual Toast Box, Singapore Kopitiam style where you get your toast, and many local delights. Expect queues during weekends",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102431982516731167091/reviews
el,1,"Bought voucher that costs $5.90 for the kaya toast set. But cashier claims that voucher can only be used to buy a Christmas set (thick toast with some corn thing). And we did not want that.

End up had to use the voucher some other day and was charged original $8.20.

Already paid $5.90 but denied use of the voucher. It's not the first time we use the voucher anyway. Voucher stated clearly it was for local breakfast set.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975098080769128459/reviews
NN PS,1,"The staff is very rude, he’s at the cashier and served the wrong drinks then we point that out. When he came changing the drinks at the table, he knock the table after putting the drinks on the table very loudly.

Definitely ruin the mood. Better eat other branches.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116769403394705054155/reviews
Wei Chee Lim (yuyuhakusho),1,"They charge $3.50 for tea, which is a lot higher than normal place..but they give u less tea…I don’t mind if you charge more for prime areas but at least give the normal amount like everywhere else!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111522951638505602664/reviews
