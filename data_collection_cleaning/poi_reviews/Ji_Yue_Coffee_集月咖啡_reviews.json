      "text": "I’m angry I didn’t know about this place sooner! Even though I live in the area, I never knew about this cafe because it’s tucked into a narrow passage right next to the Viva Vista mall sign. They do both matcha and coffee so well - haven’t had such a good cup of each in a while. The coffee is very well-balanced with a silky foam top, and the matcha is creamy and rich.\n\nThe place is so cozy and quaint, and the couple running the cafe are very friendly. Prices are also very reasonable. Can’t wait to go again!",

The coffee (we got the iced full moon) was great, although the matcha latte was a tad bit too mild for our taste.\n\nThe banana cake was also packed full of banana flavour and incredibly moist. Will definitely be back here to try the milk toast that I was eyeing!",

They serve some bakes that are freshly baked in-house too. A hidden gem cafe run by a couple, driven by a shared passion for coffee and community. Highly recommended!",

The vintage decor, eclectic art pieces, creates a cozy and nostalgic feel. It's the perfect place to relax and enjoy a quiet moment with a cup of coffee.\nHighly recommended!",
