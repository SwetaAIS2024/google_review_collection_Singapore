Aung Ohnmar,2,"I ordered take away dinner on 11th May 2025. Steamed grouper had a very strong fishy smell, it lingered for ages and suspect the fish wasn't fresh. Smell was bad when I opened fish from the plastic wrap. I paid for it S$45. Shouldn't cook not fresh fish for customer. Everything else that ordered was okay taste-wise.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102700992338985327953/reviews
Xen,5,"Ordered at this restaurant for the first time with their lemon chicken rice, $6 with plenty of rice, and 5 chunks of chicken, the sauce is super flavourful and delicious, really leaves one coming back for more. Revisited with their honey chicken rice and again did not disappoint me at all. Super juicy and fulfilling and planning to head back to try the remaining menu dishes. The cashier might be a little cold and unresponsive but the food makes up for all of it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104000842156487678731/reviews

Rebecca Nancy,1,"When I went down to place my dinner order on March 20th, the man at the counter appeared really confused. He works in that restaurant and appeared to be confused by the variety of foods. It was made clear that I wanted my bee hoon to have sambal added and to be spicy. After waiting for 25 minutes, they packed my food and delivered it; however, when we got home, we noticed everything was a mess. Chicken with prawn paste was cooked horribly. The chicken within was blooded and a little cold. The chicken was hiding inside because there was too much flour. For Bee hoon I informed him that I wanted sambal,but he failed to inform the cook. Last night, I observed them preparing a meal for the neighbor's Tender best staff.The food looked good enough to eat,but why is it so bad when you prepare Food for your customers? I just have to wonder if you and your workers will eat the garbage you prepared for us or others. If you can't deliver what your customer requests, you should probably stop. The seafood shop that isn't halal certified can still deliver food to their customers' requests. Carry halal certified and delivery garbage food.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111105237876876694681/reviews
Nope Thanks,5,"I think this is the redeeming quality of the coffee shop.

Ordered the kway Teow Goreng twice, always great. Not too salty as well. Oyster omelette was great too. Though it's seasoned to be spicy.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114697604520200224046/reviews
