The teachers are very informed about how she is doing in school and can update me with details on how I can help her. Also, the school provides a lot of outdoor play, making it the best all-around experience for the kids!\n\nCant wait for my second kid to join soon!",

      "text": "We took a virtual tour of the school during Covid and immediately felt this was the right place for our child. After 2.5 years, we can confidently say it was the right decision, seeing our child's growth and happiness speaks volumes. The dedicated teaching staff truly connects with the kids, my child can name all the teachers, even those who don’t directly teach her!\n\nI love how the school has so many thoughtful initiatives to empower the children and broaden their experiences. Recently, my child shared that they assign a 'class monitor' for the day, which is a great way to foster leadership skills. The cultural events they plan are amazing, and we appreciate being involved as parents, creating a strong, welcoming community.\n\nThe school's emphasis on active outdoor play really aligns with our values. Early childhood development benefits so much from physical activity, and having access to a dedicated playground and spacious soccer field is such a plus!\n\nMost importantly, the kids are happy, and it's clear that the school is always striving to improve and provide the best possible experience for both children and families.",

Lots of field trips planned during the year.\n\nFor example, Parents were encouraged to participate during National Day school celebration by setting up several cultural booths to educate children about ethnicity, landmarks, food - all through games. Ours was a British booth, see photo below.\n\nOverall my son and daughter love RSH!",

      "text": "After the school tour, the lady (whose name I prefer not to mention) said to send the fee schedule via WhatsApp but never followed through. She mentioned their goal to expand the level my child would be in, but her actions didn’t quite align with the goal. During the tour, she didn’t seem very passionate about her job—or perhaps just to me. I don’t feel comfortable letting my child spend time with someone so low-energy. Additionally, they didn’t even turn on the lights in an indoor space full of children until I entered. It was quite dark in the room that day… A firm NO to this school.",

The curriculum is thoughtfully designed to promote social and emotional development. It's clear that the teachers go above and beyond to tailor activities to each child's needs and interests, fostering a love for learning from a young age.\n\nHygiene and safety are also priorities here. They adhere to safety protocols put my mind at ease, knowing my child is in the best possible hands. Regular communication with parents, including updates and progress reports, further showcases the center's commitment to transparency.\n\nThe variety of enrichment activities offered, from creative arts to outdoor play, ensures that children are engaged and excited to attend each day. The sense of community among parents is an added bonus, creating a supportive network..",
