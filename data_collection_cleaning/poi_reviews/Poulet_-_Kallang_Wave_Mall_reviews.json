Their dark chocolate creme brulee is really good, very thick, I enjoyed every bite. Try them all, you will not be disappointed! I have found their tiramisu just OK. All dishes are very good value for money. Staff is super nice and friendly. I will come back for sure!",

I especially loved the chicken, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the brussel sprouts were a standout‚Äîcrispy, well-roasted, and packed with flavor.\n\nPortion sizes were generous, making the meal feel like great value. The service was friendly and efficient, and the overall vibe of the place was warm and welcoming.\n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for a satisfying, well-prepared meal. I‚Äôll definitely be back!",

Had only wished that our table was not assigned so close to the other tables, which made us feel so awkward and uncomfortable throughout our time here. They were plenty of empty seats available at the back, and we don‚Äôt understand why it was not assigned to us since the restaurant was not that crowded.",

      "text": "Tried the lunch set which allows you to choose a starter, main course and drink. I chose the French onion soup, miso clam carbonara and ice lemon tea.\nFrench onion soup was well done but the carbonara was overly salty because of the miso. I asked for some chilli to cut the cloyness of the creamy sauce but they only have chilli flakes available. And tobasco which is not really spicy. Suggestion to the waitress that they make some red cut chilli available. After all, some pure Italian joints do provide them. Another complain: I bit into a few broken shells from the clam. It was really irritating and could be dangerous.",
