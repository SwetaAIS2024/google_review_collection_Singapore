SHARON NAVARRO,1,"Our experience in this bar was very disappointing as the man (owner) showed a not friendly treatment especially to one of our friend. He signalled a cross sign to indicate that we’re not welcome in this bar until he recognises that the friend who brought us there is their regular. He gave a poor and rude service towards different nationality, making us feel that the bar only welcomes westerns and locals. There was a scene where the man asked what’s our order, and we politely told him that a friend went to the bar counter to place our order but he insisted that our friend only ordered for himself and in a rude tone. We had enough of his indifference and told him that we were actually ordering a bottle of bourbon, that did the trick and he was kinda pleased. However,  his ill treatment didn’t stop there. He served the bottle and glasses and still rude telling us not to touch this, not to do that, and wanted his way, spoiling our mood for the night. We just wanted to enjoy the night but we were judged as if we cannot afford to be in this bar. We hope they will be more welcoming and treat everyone equally, most specially in this sector.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103066026122930369306/reviews
Marco Lim,1,"Confusing concept. Looks polished on the outside except that you have to be completely demolished of your expectations. Ordered a Negroni tasted like sweet vermouth on ice. Grasshopper tasted like mint milk not shaken not stirred, they put ice in the martini glass. White Russian tasted like Morning chocolate milk. Come here if you want to get pissed off. My orange looks like a monkey bit it off or something.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112157600953746521614/reviews
