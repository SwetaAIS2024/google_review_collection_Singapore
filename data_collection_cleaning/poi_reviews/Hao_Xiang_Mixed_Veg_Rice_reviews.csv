Ke Yuan Tan,1,"Family member ordered this takeaway. On one side, the fish was normal. Flipped to the other side, whole side was burnt and chao tah.

Simon Y,4,"Relatively new stall in the coffeeshop. The selection quite good but quality hit and miss, eg. the prawn fritters looked and tasted overnight as there were so much oil retention in the batter, possibly due to 2nd frying. But for such comprehensive selections, you do not expect every dish to be on point.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110316451866688483932/reviews
