Prakruthi Shashidhar,5,"Our daughter loves Little Seeds(SJSM). She adapted to school very quickly and adores her teachers & friends.
Great teachers, very approachable and caring.
My daughter spends almost 8 hours at school each day. Her vocabulary and social skills have improved immensely.
We really appreciate the inter-generational relationship building programme by school.
The school always provides the updates of our child‚Äôs development and also helps us, parents understand how we can help our child in their positive growth.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115062016581761807018/reviews
Oaky YT Teo,5,"I had transferred my child from another preschool due to the longer commute, and we have never been happier with this decision. Within the first month, I saw how my child had gained independence and confidence in doing things for himself. Almost 2 years down the road, and I am still extremely satisfied with how the school manages gaps for improvement - be it staff shortage which happens everywhere as we know or providing an improved curriculum. There's a strong sense of community here and while we are not a Christian family, we have always felt comfortable to request having our child sit out of some religious based activities. This inclusiveness and respect they have for everyone is a big draw for me. It filters down to how the teachers and staff are outstanding examples for the children. I have not encountered a single teacher who didn't seem fully qualified. We can also see how wholeheartedly they are raising the children alongside us parents. Another unique factor has got to be the joined activities between the nursing home and the school. Even without the activities,simply having the children share that same space with the elderly has countless benefits. My child looks forward to school everyday and goes in not just willingly but full of joy!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112139844846456156938/reviews

The teachers are nurturing and loving, the bilingual programme enables the children to experience both languages in their daily lives and the school has many open and safe spaces for them to encounter nature. The inter-generational programme is also very enriching. Thank you for the love poured into their lives!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101173146190838574294/reviews
