John Tay,3,"Had their curry fish head and it's just a normal dish. Nothing too fanciful or memorable. Place is a 10 minute walk from Yio Chu Kang MRT and it's right below a block of shop houses.

Got served immediately and the food was ready within 15 minutes.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110013923047008286983/reviews

Dan Chong,3,"Just like any other Zhi Char restaurant, can't comment much but price on the slightly high side. Key issue might be the parking where only about 15 lots max.

Ang Dolly,4,"Fish head steamboat taste just nice, not too salty not bland. The ingredients provided are ample, yet not excessive. I like it with goji berry & other herbs. Staffs are friendly. Appreciate that my mum was greeted with happy mothers' day. Can take order through phone. Price is reasonable. üëç",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105094614029268051784/reviews
