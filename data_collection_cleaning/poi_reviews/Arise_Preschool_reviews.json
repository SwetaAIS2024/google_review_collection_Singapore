A very warm and closely knitted environment for them to grow and learn with loving and dedicated teachers and staff too, who are very responsive and helpful. The children love going to school and still have fond memories of the time spent.\nIndeed, it takes a village to raise a child and we are glad that we are a part of this village.",
