All the nurses and staff here are friendly and helpful. Our toddler feels very at ease whenever we visit even when he is getting his vaccination.\n\n*TIP: parking/drop off entrance is on ORCHARD SPRING LANE.\n\nAverage waiting time: 5-15 minutes on the weekdays.",

She said she will call back and she did - she asked me \" what is your inquiry\"...so I had to repeat  the inquiry again and she told me to call back.\nWe are working and everyone is busy - and on top of it your child is in pain and trying to see if I could visit the clinic and solve the issue - and then this customer service.\nHer voice was so robotic, low tone,  nothing friendly, sounded like she's bored with work or stressed, either way it was not a great customer service and felt I did not want to take my child to the clinic.",

We left Singapore for several years, and then returned 8 years later and the staff is still kind, understanding and welcoming and if you need to see the doctor on the same day, they do what they can to ensure that your child is seen.\n\nThe doctors are knowledgeable, patient and friendly. We saw Dr. Shivani today and she was so attentive with my son and he wasn’t shy to speak to her. She explained everything clearly and explained her prescriptions clearly as well.\n\nI never feel like my questions are unanswered here as the doctors always give me time to ask.\n\nThe nurses are all lovely and do a great job of distracting the children as they are having their jabs.\n\nThey bill directly to insurance which is extremely appreciated too.\n\nThank you so much for all that you all do!",
