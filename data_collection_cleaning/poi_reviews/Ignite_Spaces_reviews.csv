Rachel Cheng,5,"Surprise find in the second level of the mall;
They offer both board games and VR escape room. Note they have quite a huge collection of board games (and some are new!!!)
Get the arena pass as it’s one entry price for the whole day (until they close shop) & they have small private rooms for up to 4 people;
Great place for hanging out with friends and team building (or when you didn’t get to do prawning downstairs)
Currently there’s a free drink promotion for first visit & 20% off",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100570360463465006898/reviews
