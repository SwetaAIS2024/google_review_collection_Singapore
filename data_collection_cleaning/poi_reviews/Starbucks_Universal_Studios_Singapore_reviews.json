      "text": "Possibly the most popular spot in USS as it offered seating and air conditioning. The blazing heat and humidity in Singapore is insane, bordering on ridiculous and anyone who had spent just 5 mins walking around the theme park would be completely drenched in sweat from head to toe. So you can imagine just how much of a welcome relief this Starbucks is when you're about to pass out from the heat. The interior appears to have been recently renovated with more seating provided. The food offerings are no different from any regular Starbucks. It gets loud and rowdy though with large family groups with kids so be prepared. Also be prepared to wait a while for a seat as few want to leave the comfort of the air conditioned interior for the ludicrous heat outside.",
