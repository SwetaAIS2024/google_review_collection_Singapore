      "text": "I currently send my 2 kids ( K2 and N1) to this campus. I really love the environment of this school, No regret! Most of every morning , if wheather is fine kids are going for outdoor walk along the river and learn about nature and get to see wild animals ( lots of cute chicks!) There are alot of events organised by teachers,  my kids are always so excited to attend those events, they get to do alot of art works, join the activities with friends, wear different costumes,  some time bring snacks to campus and share with friends during festive season. And at foyer area there are lots of cute decorations created by teachers, I always can see lots of efforts by teachers!\n\nMost importantly All the teachers and office staffs are so kind and friendly,  and even though this is Mega child care center, I'm very surprised that every teachers we meet inside the campus always remember my kids name! I always feel thankful and reassured that my kids are taken care by all those teachers and staffs :)\nI've never regretted that i send my kids this campus to learn!! :) I'm really feel thankful to every teachers and Staffs!! :)) I personally strongly recommend this school!! ðŸ˜„",

      "text": "First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to school at Sengkang Riverside Park. This is my second child who has entered the school, he has been enrolled the school since PN.\n\nFrom PN to N2, he is indeed a difficult student, he does not cooperate in school, is very naughty and mischievous. We also understand his behavior, but the teachers have never given up on him. This is something that we, as parents, are very grateful for the teachers' meticulous care for him.\n\nHe is now in K1, during the parent-teacher conference last month, his teacher also mentioned to us that he is now willing to participate in activities and curriculum with other classmates in class, he has indeed made a lot of progress.\n\nHe also shared with me what lunch he had at school, and when he received a gift from his classmate, he would tell me which classmateâ€™s birthday and gave him the gift.\n\nIn fact, his learning ability a bit delay compared from his peers, but we see that the teachers treat him the same as other students.\n\nOn the contrary, we feel that many teachers like him very much. Other children hug him when they see him coming to school and he did communicate with other children too.\n\nWhen we pick him up from school, we can see him playing with toys with other children in the class and communicating with teachers. We as parents are very pleased and grateful for this.\n\nWe would like to thank school and the teachers who taught him before and now. Thank you for never giving up on him. Instead, you have given him a lot of help and made him improve a lot in learning.",

      "text": "It has been an enriching, educational and exciting journey for both my grandsons attending Skool4kids Campus @Sengkang Riverside Park.\n\nMy grandsons are in K2 and Pre-nursery group level. Both age 6.5 years old and 2.5 years old respectively.\n\nThey both enjoyed the morning walk by the luscious greenery surrounding the campus organised by the school. The morning exploration in the park helps the kids appreciate nature and grant deep bonding amongst the kids as they discover new plants, birds and trees together.  The touch of fresh air in the morning keep their mind ready for the day's activities.\n\nThe school's curriculum has also enriched both my grandsons in their progress in learning and growth development. They have learnt to be more independent eg eating meals on their own, taking responsibility to check their own bags and putting their shoes in place. Many good practices were adopted from the school.\n\nThe teachers and staff are most helpful and friendly.\n\nFrontline administrative staff like Sharon and Raneen are always ready to assist parents and grandparents pertaining to all matters for the well being of the kids. They would at times run that extra mile to support the parents. Eg when the kid ran on a fever in the middle of the school day, they will grant focused attention on the child while waiting for the parent to pick up the kid. Immediate attention was crucial and they would always put on their best to ensure the kid is taken care like placing kool fever pad to bring down the temperature and keep the comfortable. Often time, having to also pacify crying kids to soothe them and keep them calm.\n\nThe teachers are very caring, dedicated and committed. They always keep the parents updated on the child's progress, development and issues of concern.\n\nA very communal, family oriented and kampong spirit culture and environment. I drive my grandsons to and fro school everyday and has truly enjoyed the camaraderie with the teachers and staff.\n\nA very united spirit amongst the team of teachers and staff that I cannot find anywhere else.\n\nGrandmother\nAmy Tan\nGrandsons\nJayden Kwong K2\nJace Kwong PGN",

      "text": "My baby was placed in infant care but he had diarrhoea after attending school for 5 halve days. He was subsequently down with stomach flu, cold, cough and fever whenever we sent him back to school. I understand baby's immune system is low but also probably he could not adapt to the large class size (maximum of 25 babies in each class) as his milk intake is very low when he was at the infant care centre. Thankfully we have withdrawn our baby and placed him in a centre with a smaller class size. Many thanks to Reena for the prompt and smooth withdrawal process.\nThe other admin executive actually persuaded me to stay on, saying I am receiving good subsidy rates. This really puts me off... as how can I sacrifice my baby's health for subsidy rates! Please be more considerate in your choice of words.",

Extremely poor management. Admin staffsit in office, showing no responsibilities in looking for the child and no initiatives to look for them. Just say no reply from teacher and expect parents to wait without reasons. Is not the first time experiencing waiting exceeding 15 mins to pick child. They should look into the process.",
