Traccey Lien,5,"Never been! It was the first time we took our seven-year-old to a children's in-line skating class. . . I wanted to skate but there were too many people. My classmates at Nanyang Primary School said it was fun, so I traveled across mountains and rivers to the west coast. . . The air here is good, and the children had a great time participating in their Summer School Holidays Skate Camp. Learned it in a few days. Itâ€™s amazing how quickly I learned rollerblading!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114375444467194664978/reviews
é™ˆChengè€³ä¸œ,5,"West Coast Park is fun. . We can provide professional roller skating courses for both adults and children. The coaches really care. . . I have to leave a good review! Children attend holiday training classes. . . I had a great time learning inline skating at the West Coast Park and learned a lot. . I can't wait to go to class every day. There is too much pressure in life, and children just love to play. .
There are not many Summer Camps in Singapore during holidays. Children can learn English, exercise and have fun. Some children started attending classes at the age of three or four. . ðŸ˜†",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111318896882941975801/reviews
