Alex Alferovs,5,"Took my dad to Real Health Medical at Novena Specialist Center after sustaining a shoulder/chest injury.

Reception staff are very polite and patiently assisted with the registration process.

Dr Simon (Shen Ying Bin) is very approachable and down to earth whilst providing a comprehensive and professional service.

Prior to any adjustments/treatment we sat down for a verbal consult outlining the issue. Following the consult, Dr Simon diagnosed the issue and performed several adjustments. After the appointment, a list of exercises was provided for my dad to do in his own time.

Very professional and highly recommended.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107468354157217036410/reviews

She said no objection for my wife international  travel during 3 months of pregnancy and she has suffered miscarriage. She used to give very high does of HCG injections which may not require for some ladies.  I visited this Dr by looking at her years of experience, but didt find her diagnosis and medicines knowledge up to date.   Please think twice before visiting this Dr.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103939036468452830901/reviews
