CP,5,"I think most people including myself would have eaten countless times of bbq stingray here at East Coast Lagoon Food Village. What about bbq Cod fish? This is my first time eating this after watching the video by Ali Eats. It is indeed amazing like what was shared in the video. The bbq Cod steak is crispy on the outside and super soft and yet firm, and moist on the inside. What is amazing is there is not even the slightest hint of fishiness. It is really enjoyable down to the last bite. I ordered a sambal kang kong (I asked to have it less spicy) to go with the fish. It is the best kang kong in my memory. Usually the kang kong is just spicy but this one has that hint of sweetness and lemongrass aroma. The food here is worth a try to find out for yourself.

Update: I have been back here numerous times and in this latest visit, I had their chilli crab and bitter gourd with eggs. Both dishes are executed so perfectly.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
David Oon,4,"Liked the fried calamari best. Crispy, not oily, and goes well with the sauce, fresh onion and pickled cabbage. The deep fried sting ray is also decently tasty and not overly salty. Pretty good service from the auntie taking orders.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111461636018977333111/reviews
Jonathan Chew,5,"A thick slab of stingray with flavourful sambal. While pricier than most of the other shops which start at $12/15/18 in tiers, this only has a single size at $18. They seem to prepare this en-masse at peak hours however â€“ when I ordered, I was given one immediately which wasn't piping hot, indicating it was prepared a while prior. While I appreciate the consideration for speed, I also value hot food! The stingray was great nevertheless, but it would surely have been much better fresh off the grill.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106144108752002112533/reviews
Brad,5,"Outstanding!  The stingray was tender, and the sambal had just enough heat.  The satay was delicious. The calamari was crisp and tender.  Combined with the outdoor setting on a beautiful evening, it was amazing!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110426350605866478662/reviews
punyshark,5,"Loved the BBQ crab that I ordered for a mini celebration today. The meat was thick, solid and chunky, crab weighed 900g. Everything they cook here tastes great. Usual favourite items I order are Tua Tao, BBQ Spicy Stingray, Salted Egg Prawn and Deep Fried Baby Sotong!  Loved it!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101852695494997424451/reviews
