Wanling Hong,3,"I loved this place. But i’m here to drop my review as i am extremely saddened that their standard dropped so much from 1 year ago. Came here 3 times in the past year and their quality of food consistently dropped. Nasi lemak with absolutely no nasilemak flavours at all.

It’s tough to do fnb in singapore but i really hope they can maintain their standard. They started off great, to “meh”, now it’s just bad.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105952685002524199454/reviews
Kareen Frances Chua,5,"I like the clean and tasty food, definitely less salt/ oil compared to usual sg/ my food. The chicken was tender and easy to eat. My fav was the belachan!

Rose and lychee tea was comforting. Wanted to try to rose latte, unfortunately decaf is not served here. Would suggest having decaf options as singaporeans are now more sleep hygiene conscious.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107251138755155947050/reviews
Leon Kwang,4,"Ok, 3pm on a lazy Saturday, walked in without queue and table by the window (great start).

We even got the last portion of curry chicken for the day, ordered the Rosemary chicken (which we learned is the bone in version of the boneless honey chicken), and both of them were pretty good, especially the curry chicken (homely with a bit of heat).

Now, the bacon carbonara was disappointing, it was wet and milky, clearly not their competency, but not everywhere gets every item perfect (my bad to pick this ''high risk"" item).

Special mention for the service, really attentive and accommodating.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews

LP Pua,5,"It is a small restaurant on the ground floor of an HDB block with a seating capacity of about 26. We went without a reservation on a weekend and waited around 20 minutes. For the price of around $13.80, the food was generally above expectations and came in huge portions. The ice lemon tea was very good. The service was excellent. The best part was that this restaurant does not charge GST or service charge (which typically adds about 20% to the price). Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
