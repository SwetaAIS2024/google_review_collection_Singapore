The 4D Eyebag removal makes me look younger and refreshed. Dr Medora and the team were always there even during my recovery period. The procedure is not painful and the recovery period was a week for me. It‚Äôs really worth it! It‚Äôs the best decision I have made! Thank you very much Dr Medora!",

      "text": "I‚Äôve been dealing with worsening eye bags and fat deposits for a while and wanted a non-surgical solution. I found Zoe Medical and decided to go for their 4D Eye Bag Removal treatment‚Äîand I‚Äôm so glad I did!\n\nThe whole process was smooth and well explained. The procedure was abit painful, and recovery was fast. I had some swelling/puffiness on the first week day, but by day three it was already going down, and by the end of the week, it was completely gone.\n\nThe results were amazing‚Äîmy eye bags were gone, the sunken area below looked much smoother, and the skin under my eyes started to tighten naturally. I looked fresher and more awake without any downtime or surgery.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jocelyn, who followed up with me consistently via WhatsApp and Dr Medora made sure I was doing well throughout the recovery.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a non-surgical solution for eye bags, I highly recommend Zoe Medical. The results speak for themselves, and the care I received was outstanding. Super happy with the outcome!\n\n-Darin",

Staff were informative and the initial assessment discussion with Dr. Medora was positive. No regrets after getting my 4D eyebag removal here. Only a week of downtime, but the fantastic results are permanent. While procedure results are individual, I think the team here is quite professional.",

Recovery was just a week of swelling, no pain at all. Dr Medora is exceptionally skilled and knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing. Best of all, the results are permanent.
