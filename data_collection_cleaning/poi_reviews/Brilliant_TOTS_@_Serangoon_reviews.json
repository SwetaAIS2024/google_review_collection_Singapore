      "text": "My child has been attending Brilliant Tots @ Serangoon since N1 and is set to graduate this year. I am extremely pleased with the exceptional care and attention provided.\n\nThe teachers at Brilliant Tots are truly outstanding—nurturing, patient, and passionate about early childhood education. Special thanks to Teacher Rai, who has taken excellent care of my child, forming strong bonds and giving me great peace of mind. The staff communicates effectively with parents, providing regular video/photos updates on my child’s progress and activities.\n\nBrilliant Tots' comprehensive curriculum balances structured learning and play, fostering cognitive and social development. My child has shown remarkable improvement in language skills, creativity, and social interaction. The center offers various enrichment programs, such as STEM classes, art, and physical activities, which my child eagerly anticipates. The excursions to fish farms, indoor playgrounds, annual sports day and graduation performance are a huge plus.\n\nOverall, Brilliant Tots exceeds our expectations and I highly recommend it to any parent seeking a safe, nurturing, and enriching environment for their child.",

The school also organises various excursions, activities, and engages external vendors for enrichment lessons. There is also a lovely outdoor play area which the kids enjoy.",
