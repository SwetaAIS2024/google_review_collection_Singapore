Aashmika Varma,4,"We decided to try the Mango Sorbet and Belgian Chocolate Gelato. They were quite expensive for one scoop each.
The two flavors had notably different levels of sweetness; the mango sorbet was overwhelmingly sweet, whereas the chocolate gelato struck a perfect balance between the bitterness of dark chocolate and the richness of cocoa.
The absence of a seating area was quite a bummer! :o
If you're someone who doesn't favor exceedingly sweet treats, I'd suggest avoiding the Mango Sorbet and opting for the chocolate Belgian gelato instead :P",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104152931382854540911/reviews
