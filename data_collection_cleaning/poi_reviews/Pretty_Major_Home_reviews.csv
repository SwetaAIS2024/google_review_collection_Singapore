jo jas,5,"We’re suckers for aesthetic items and love that the pretty major pot & pan fit in perfectly with the overall aesthetic of our home! The pan is deep enough and comes with a steaming basket, which makes it perfect for steaming items. We’ve cooked sunny side ups and even pork belly in the pan and it’s really completely non-stick - making it so easy for us to wash up after cooking 🥰 we also have their beautiful wall art that’s a great addition to our home, the textures just add so much dimensions to our otherwise boring study room!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109990695274605895670/reviews
Littlecheesedoor,5,"Pretty Major has been a brand associated with elegant and minimalist non-stick cookware. We were pleasantly surprised by its light weight, non-stick properties and versatility after cooking with them 🙊

They are perfect for any home kitchens and their well crafted design and light weight make them a true blessing for any aspiring home chefs!

An added bonus is their super cute packaging and most importantly, they are a local brand! 🫶🏻🇸🇬

Thank you Pretty Major! 🩵",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106303146070185143378/reviews
Tuti Nur Insyirah,5,"AAll I can say is LOVE LOVE LOVEEE! The abstract painting at the end of the hallway adds a splash of colour to the rest of the otherwise minimalist room, making a stunning focal point. On top of that, the quality of the painting is VERY GOOD and it's affordable as well. Definitely buying more to add to the collection.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102815227800214075209/reviews
