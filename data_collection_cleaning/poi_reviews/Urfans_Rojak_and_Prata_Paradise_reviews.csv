Yellow Bear,4,"Nice Halal food with meatless options. For vegetarians, do inform them that you don’t want curry with meat.
Reasonably priced too;
2 Pratas for $2.60, a delicious light meal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
IAm Human,4,"Got egg, cheese and normal prata, at $2, $2.5, $1.3 respectively. Chocolate tissue plata was $4. All were pretty average, I think they could do with more cheese/ egg added.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114171272522764657729/reviews
Bryan,1,"Premade lousy awful prata.. requested one more plate as the kids were sharing, and was being question “why you need 1 more plate?”

The hell? This is the first time we were being question like this and obviously we need it?!

It’s not them washing anyway, why ask so much?!

Will not be ordering from them again, not recommended.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115527441573527762214/reviews
