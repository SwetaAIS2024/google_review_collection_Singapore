Jodeci Fine,5,"Another hidden stall from this happening neighbourhood known for their fabulous and reasonably priced kolo mee, fried ytf and laksa.

We tried the char siew sauce kolo mee @$4.50 and we are surprised how authentic it is. Exactly same taste as what we had back in random Kuching HC. Char siew and braised mince meat was delicious. Overall not overpowering, not too bland, not oily and this is the right taste we miss. Simple yet flavourful. One mouthful of it bursting with memory of Kuching!!

We will be back for the laksa.

M P,1,"I find the kolo mee very disappointing. Not much taste and no chilli added to

The noodles are ok nothing to rave about. So I wouldn’t recommend

The laksa is ok but also nothing good about it. Note chilli quite spicy so don’t mix all

Will not recommend",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112908652574347918174/reviews

Mike,5,"I tried the original taste, it’s good 👍, the Kolo mee is authentic; besides they all serves wanton/black source favourite, will it try later. Price wise it’s on par to the nearby wanton mee stalls. Overall, it’s good to have foods choice in this area",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116996185191109459511/reviews
