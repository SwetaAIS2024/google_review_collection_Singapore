The toast is good, soft boiled egg is alright. The chocolate cake I got wasn’t that great though, the cream isn’t good.",

I asked the cashier why their menu board still stated the set, and the cashier replied no longer valid!  What????? No longer valid? Or simply want to earn more money? By charging additional $2 on regular to medium size barley!\n\n$14.50 for the curry rice set!",
