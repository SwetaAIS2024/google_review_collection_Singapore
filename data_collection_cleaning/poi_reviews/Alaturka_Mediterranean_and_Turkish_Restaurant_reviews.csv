Stephanie Oh,5,"Absolutely loved our dinner at Alaturka! The food was amazing, everything we had was full of flavor and so well done. We shared a meze with flatbread, grilled meats, fish, and a few sides, and every dish was delicious. The atmosphere was really lovely too, relaxed and welcoming! Finished off with a kunafa for dessert, which was the perfect sweet ending. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for great Turkish food in Singapore! Would love to visit again :)",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111797040467859223957/reviews
jimmy wong,4,"Service staff was very helpful with our orders. Order Peynirli cheese bread, mix barbecue for 2 and Bayildi eggplant cheese dish. Food is tasty and delicious, meat is tender but on the pricier side. The place indoors is small but atmosphere is good. Overall a pleasant dining experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117478717640779878127/reviews
