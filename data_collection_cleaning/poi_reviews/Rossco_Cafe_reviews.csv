Khai Zaman,5,"Very nice place to have great lunch. Location is very spacious as it is it's own building. Plenty to choose from.

Great Malaysian local dishes which are also very delicious. Place is very clean and airy and is not so packed even during lunch time.

Highly recommended to come early as well as they have breakfast options.

Update: went again a few times and has never disappointed us. I brought my friends and family to enjoy their food and live music. If you want a solid malay food experience, this is the place.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113341514809650185484/reviews

Nur shazni Salasi,1,"The food was so-so, the glass was not clean properly. Tak sure apa yang viral atau diviralkan. I was so excited to try the food. And surprisingly, ada tali dalam my sayur. Very clear the owner took out the tali using his bare hands. The owner rasa that is okay untuk ada  tali in my food. Sorry not sorry. You guys need to go for food hygiene class. Very very disappointed with the food & the owner. Maybe here just a place for orang office area situ lepak lepak.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112020085202459157985/reviews
Harman Harison,3,Good venue for lunch. A variety of Malay style dishes. Good Malay music selection in the background with okay atmosphere. Price is a bit on the expensive if compared to other restaurants but still not too expensive.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100447961201731726488/reviews
