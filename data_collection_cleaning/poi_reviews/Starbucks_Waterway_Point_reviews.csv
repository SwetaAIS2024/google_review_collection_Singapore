YY,5,"Not a huge Starbucks, but there‚Äôs enough tables to go around, although during peak hours like in the afternoon there‚Äôs a lot of diners standing around waiting for seats.

Cham Ong,1,"Never a smile whenever I go there to get coffee beans. After grinding the coffee beans, other branch staff would take the effort to put sticky tape on the bag to ensure the powder doesn't spill.
