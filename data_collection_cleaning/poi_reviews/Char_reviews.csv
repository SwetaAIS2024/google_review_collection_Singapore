TG,5,"Great roast meats! The char siew and roast meat is tender and mouth watering!  Cooked to perfection.

We also had Cereal prawns, Sweet Sour Pork, Vegetables and hor fun.  All were good.

Only thing is it's in an old shophouse and they need to open the main door to ventilate which makes the place warm, other than that, all good!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107091521509741814511/reviews
Sanaya Bharucha,5,"What an amazing meal!

The pork char siew and the roast pork with crackling were both exceptional and paired beautifully with their egg fried rice - we even got some extra char siew sauce on the side - yummm!

The dock was tasty but unfortunately quite chewy so we left most of it uneaten. But everything else was fabulous and definitely worth a visit!

The servers were also incredibly warm and helpful!

It was a lovely bustling place so be sure to make a reservation!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115191512084078279586/reviews
Stephy Tay,3,"We chance upon this restaurant after the one we wanted to visit was closed for the day.
Char siew was nicely roasted.
The roasted pork is jsut nice and the chicken is too tough.
But the veggies is the best in my favour.

Overall experience was not bad",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114918578836460834092/reviews
Ball Ball,4,"Glad that Char has re-opened at Race Course Road. I like the slightly charred char Siew with the caramelized black sauce. A bit disappointed with the roast pork though. Their roast pork used to have a very nice hint of rosemary, but not anymore. Would’ve been better if the eggplant casserole is less salty. The tornado butter egg prawns is rich and flavorful. Totally worth the price. Service staff are attentive and helpful. Will visit again to try other dishes.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111153368016481689080/reviews

The service was exceptional—attentive, friendly, and efficient, making the entire experience seamless and enjoyable. Love the charsiu, roast pork, cod fish, sweet and sour soup. Will come back again to try others in the menu.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102852516701663371506/reviews
