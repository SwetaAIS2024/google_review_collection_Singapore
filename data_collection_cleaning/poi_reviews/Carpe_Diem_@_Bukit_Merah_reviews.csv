Phyllis P,5,"I enrolled my child in Carpe Diem Starlets Sparkle  and I couldn't be happier with my decision. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, and they go above and beyond to ensure that every child feels welcome and comfortable. The classrooms are bright and spacious, with plenty of toys and learning materials to keep the kids engaged and curious. I love that they offer a well-rounded curriculum that includes everything from reading and writing to art and music. Plus, they have a strong focus on social-emotional development, which is so important for young children. Overall, I highly recommend them  to any family looking for a nurturing, stimulating, and fun learning environment for their little ones.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111177491217474907997/reviews
