Patrick Patrick,4,"Another shopping center located between Teck Whye and Bukit Panjang neigbourhood. The main tenant is Sheng Siong supermarket.

Junction 10, formerly known as Ten Mile Junction, is a modern shopping center located in the Bukit Panjang area of Singapore. The mall has undergone significant redevelopment, transforming from its original state into a vibrant community hub that blends history with contemporary amenities.

The mall offers a wide range of facilities catering to various needs, from shopping and dining to education and fitness. It hosts a variety of shops, including a large Sheng Siong supermarket and numerous enrichment centers like Mindchamps Preschool. Fitness enthusiasts can take advantage of the Fitness First gym, while those seeking relaxation can enjoy services at the House of Traditional Javanese Massage.

Junction 10 is also home to several eateries, providing a mix of local and Asian cuisines. Whether you're looking to enjoy a meal, shop for essentials, or participate in family-friendly activities like bowling or visiting the arcade, the mall offers something for everyone. The convenient location, just a short walk from the Bukit Panjang MRT station, makes it easily accessible for both residents and visitors.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107557588153745055831/reviews

General Twilight,5,"Decent place with two storeis. Mostly some dining options, a sheng siong outlet and many tuition centres here. It is a 10 minites walk away from hillion mall. Not much footfall but it distance to a nearby hdb estate helps in getting people to buy groceries. Just a small mall in bukit panjang. It is accessible with many bus services plying the mall.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114314523990529053400/reviews
CK Tan,4,"I give this place 4 out of 5 stars. It does have the 5 stars potential but it is just that there the crowds are just not getting to this place for 1 reason - Sheng Siong is not too popular among the residences in both Teck Whye and Bukit Panjang but Mindchamps and Mr DIY should be enough to draw in those that prefer a quieter place to spend their money. However, this is definitely the place to go to for a lazy morning, weekday or weekends since it is just not as crowded as nearby Hillion Mall or Bukit Panjang Plaza, where most people prefer. Fun Toast is there with ample tables, Encik Tan, a Bakery with prices that are less than those of the 2 mentioned above. Lastly, the LRT station, Phoenix is convenient enough for most people.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102797007706981476316/reviews
