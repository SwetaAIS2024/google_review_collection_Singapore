She understands well how Montessori works and able to convince us how Montessori eventually help our kid as compared to typical thematic preschool. The school has given us a warmth impression and the admin’s quick response enhance the overall sign up experience. Our boy has settled down for more than a month and happy going to school. Most importantly he brings back his sharing almost everyday. Thank you the team in MMI Holland Grove.",

      "text": "This school is really outstanding. We are a pretty international family – I am Singaporean, my wife is Brazilian and our 5-year old daughter was born in USA – and we have lived in several different places. Our daughter has gone to different preschools in USA, Brazil and Singapore where she attended preschool most recently at MMI Holland Grove. We found this preschool to be of a very high standard comparable to the best international preschools. Their teaching methods are awesome, truly bringing out the Montessori Method. Their teachers have an excellent manner with the kids, and our daughter really liked them, as well as the preschool overall.",

They have 2 diploma Montessori teachers which is a luxury compared to many other alleged Montessori schools. They really know how to teach with positive guidance. My child comes back happy everyday.\nGreat park in front for outdoor activities.",
