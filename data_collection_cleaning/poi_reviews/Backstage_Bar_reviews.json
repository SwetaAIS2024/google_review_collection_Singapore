It was quiet since the party going crowd will not be in until much later. Had a drink here and I can honestly say the price here is much affordable than the other watering holes I have come across in Singapore.",

Order a drink at 2:55am finally. 18$ and gave 2$ tip.\nThen I sit down, at 3am the staff came to my table and Stole my glass and throw it into to the sink. Without any explanation or prewarning.\nAs I said I wanna complain to another guy, they said this is the manger and he is crazy and I should be quiet because they want to go back there (only gay place open until 3 am, the other just until 1am)\n\nThey might need it, I highly recommend not to go there at all. Weekend is also super overcrowded. Tantric is closed but they just use the reputation tantric had.\n\nThey could make so much money with that bar with staff, who are nice and know what they do and want to work at all.",

Good range of drinks and food, fun music and movies played on multiple screens throughout. All 'types' of people will feel welcome here so it is also a nice place to people watch. Come hang out here y'all! :)",
