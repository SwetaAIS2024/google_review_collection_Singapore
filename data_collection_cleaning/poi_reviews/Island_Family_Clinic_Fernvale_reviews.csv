Ethan Lee,3,"Doctor was very rushed in consult, took a vaccine there that needed follow up and neither doctor nor front desk staff informed me when I could come in again until I asked about it, neither did they schedule appt. Front desk also did not  instruct on how to take medication, as most places do.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112201972965065406409/reviews
Kim S,2,Consultation with dr felt very rushed. Wanted to share more about my symptoms but dr dismissed it by claiming that they know what meds to give. A $30 consultation that barely lasted 3 mins. Patients opt for private medical consultation over public because of its quality right? Which then well justify the price we pay. But is quality necessarily maintained?,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108167634228687743770/reviews
Chang Yao,5,"Dr Goh is very professional and quick to the point. Staff at counter is very patient and helpful in clarifying doubt, though the way they communicate is abit odd (which I assume its peak hour, hence there is quite a number of people).

Nonetheless, a quick and pleasant experience",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100329648590413352188/reviews
Janice Chai,1,"I went to the Fernvale branch today to consult a doctor because i was having covid symptoms. Doctor Goh was the one who served me, he did the ART quickly, didn’t even bother to wait 15 mins for the results and asked the staff to quickly dismiss me. When i was collecting my medicines, i asked the staff ‘The ART results are out?’ and ‘I thought have to wait for 15 mins?’. The lady said the results was out and it’s negative. I couldn’t do anything because there was many people at the clinic and i didn’t want to start any quarrel. When i come home i feel even unwell and i went to take ART at home again, the results is positive. Personally i highly do not recommend this clinic to everyone. Doctor Goh didn’t give a proper consult and the way he speaks feels like he was trying to dismiss me fast. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112850828190226937640/reviews
