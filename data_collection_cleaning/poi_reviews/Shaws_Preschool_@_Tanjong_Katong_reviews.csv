Zahraa Nasib,5,"I love the whole culture of Katong. The teachers were warm, friendly and welcoming during Open House. The communication between teachers and parents were great and responsive! Ms. Cass was my son’s first teacher. During Covid period, my son was enrolled and her responsiveness in communication allowed myself and my son’s smooth transition in Shaws. Now, Ms. Helissa often give personal recounts of how my child is in school. Not only that, the principal, Salmi is often around to welcome children and parents with bright smiles each morning. He is now a confident, and happy boy! More than that, I love how the team in Katong ensures that our children are being well-taken care of! Also, love the school events and excursions that involve parents into the school to have a rough idea of the daily activities implemented in Shaws. Thank you for your hard and great work!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108130577495932148587/reviews
Lakshmi Rao,5,"Shaws@Tanjong Katong is a lovely, nurturing pre-school. I am very grateful to have discovered them , I couldn't have asked for a more better environment for my kids. My daughter graduated and started primary school this year, the teachers did an amazing job preparing her for Primary in addition to ensuring she enjoyed all her pre-school years. My son just started going to Shaws last year and I am looking forward to raise him along with this lovely community",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111873016373087893600/reviews
Aparna Shah,5,"It’s a small school that is part of a very big establishment. Their play-based curriculum works well for my boys and I am amazed at how much they have picked up about everything. It offers a very good balance of sport, life skills, and academics. The kids do come out of the school absolutely loving it and wanting to learn more. The teachers and principal are warm, caring and approachable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112636690345056751316/reviews
