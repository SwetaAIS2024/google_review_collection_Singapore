cava lulu,3,Ming Kee Roasted joint opened one outlet here. What I enjoyed most is the noodle. It has the right texture with the just enough q-ness. The noodle sauce is a little salty though but acceptable still. I drained off slightly in this case. Both the chilli sauce are good with some kick and not watery flat.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103608440499184771354/reviews

Presila Sub,4,"Went with my friends for dinner. Nice food reasonable price. Nice service. We ordered seafood, grilled red snapper fish, baby kailan veg, fried bean curd with sauce, fried chicken, fried squid, tempura prawns with fried rice. We enjoyed the food very much. Chinese tea n beer went well with it. We have been there many times. I would recommend this a good seafood restaurant.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102712901355229343637/reviews
Ong Xiao Hui,1,"This review is for the disrespectful staff at Ming Kee Roasted Joint. I had ordered a takeaway of a rice and noddle item, and had mistakenly heard the staff mention that the cost is $5.30. I repeated $5.30? And he said yes. When I proceeded to just pay him the price he confirmed, he then corrected it and said it was $9.30. The staff inside the stall cutting up the meat then said in a mocking sing-song tone “$5.30?!”, and the staff collecting the money concurred, adding that if that was the price, there would be a long queue.

This attitude is very rude and disrespectful. I am never going to pastronise your stall ever again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100244694973537201713/reviews
Zappa Z,5,"Love the hokkien mee, roasted meats and fishball stall. Very good seating and comfortable except there's too many people smoking just at the perimeter of the coffeeshop, sometimes making it unbearable when a group of 4-5 all smoke at the same time and the cigarette smoke wafts into the coffeeshop.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115061777173732924901/reviews
