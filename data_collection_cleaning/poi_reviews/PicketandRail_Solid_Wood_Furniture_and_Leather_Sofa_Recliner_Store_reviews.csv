Nur Azura,3,"Received our sofa earlier than expected. We were told that we‚Äôd only receive in November, but got them a month earlier.. sofa looks good. Hopefully it is long lasting.

Update on user experience and customer service:

Sent a feedback to the company that the ‚Äúextended‚Äù button actually retracts the chair and vice versa. But the person told us the following

‚ÄúHi, the button setting is correct. You may see the demo taken from our showroom. Maybe the meaning of ‚Äúretract‚Äùor ‚Äúextend‚Äù differs among users. Nevertheless, the overall user experience shall be fine. thanks.‚Äù

EDDIE WEE,1,"Ordered the full leather sofa (almost 4k) on March 2024 thru Sunny. Sofa was delivered on early June after few chased on delivery date. Was very disappointed with the quality.

First photo was taken just less than a month and second photo was taken 6 months later.

The back rest is out of shape and the sitting cushions sinking... just barely one month and after 6 months it become worse.

The new sofa look worse than my 10 years old sofa.

P&R told us to take out the back rest and flatten it, where on earth we buy a new sofa and this to do this?

I did try to flatten it but once someone sit the back rest rest will out of shape.

Again if anyone thinking of getting sofa from them, please think twice.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117860269687957989470/reviews
