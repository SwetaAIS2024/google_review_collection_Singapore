Special thanks to Nurse Xin Ru (sorry if I got the spelling wrong) and nurse Sangeetha for their exceptional care and kindness. They were detailed, understanding, cheerful, and incredibly patient throughout. Their dedication truly made a difference, and I deeply appreciate their efforts in ensuring my mum‚Äôs comfort and well-being. Thank you for going above and beyond.",

      "text": "To Ward 41 Bed 20\nPlease send my gratitude to the fab service from  nurses Don Hua(from China), Patricia, a young malay lady in glasses( sorry did not get your name) and the rest of the nurses, Dr.Lee and those in the group of doctors taking turns in dealing with my mother last Monday to Saturday( 5 days).  Nurses were fabulous and caring, plus my mother who always never want to trouble nurses due to her nature of humility and respecting others. One constructive comment though that need improvement though. The different doctors that came to see my mother have different versions of the treatment rendered to my mother which I had brought to the attention to Dr.Lee . Though the ultimate objective is the same but it is essential to know what is the exact treatment was administered is essential for medical history records. Hence touchwood, when further treatment maybe needed doctors will know what was done previously. Just like the doctor has asked to bring my mother previous  records from other hospital. This is not the first time I have encounteted this. Doctors must clearly communicate what was done and other doctors who takes over the shift has the same understanding in communicating.\nPlease send my gratitude to the nurses, especially to those mentioned and Doctor Lee and the rest of Doctors in charge of Ward 41 Bed 20.\nThank you",
