No alternative at all from the management.\n\nSometimes there will be electric disruption too.\n\nMost of the lightings at the basement are out.\n\nEverytime when its raining the basement will be flooding and no action since the last 5 years I’ve live here.\n\nThe best part is if you complains to the management, they will blame you back.\n\nNo parking assigned to residents, anyone can just drive in and park ad they pleases. BUT, they made privileged parking for their management staff. What a joke!",

      "text": "Booked through Airbnb and allocated unit at block b, level 8 W1. The unit was a two-storey unit with 4 bedrooms in total. I believed our host was a business managing Airbnb units called Nest Home. Their instructions were clear and didn’t experience any issues checking in on our own. The car park was a a bit narrow though so bigger cars would need to be careful navigating in the car park. Security was good, friendly and showed their presence everywhere.\n\nThe unit was clean though I believe there was some wear and tear which was to be expected since it’s not really a new development. Bed was ok just that the bedsheet wasn’t the best quality, hence it’s abit rough. But it’s definitely clean. Towels, utensils and other necessary amenities were well provided. The unit fit the ten of us really well.",

We booked the family apartment which consist of 2 rooms,  a living room, eating area and cooking area\n\nLocation is a 5mins drive to legoland and mall of medini.\n\nBad points are the toiletries seem to be empty. But the host replaced within the same day.\n\nAlthough parking is great and there is ample security, lots are limited at night.\n\nThere is a fitness corner, gym and small swimming pool. Also a tennis court.",

The only missing piece of the puzzle here is that it's located way too remote from even a convenience store, let alone cafes or restaurants within walking distance. On the bright side it's only 10 minutes away from the second link checkpoints.",
