Table and chairs are not the normal that get you from coffeeshop but they are using wooden tables and chairs that add ambience to the place. The econ been hoon stall is the most popular and has the longest queue. Coffee and tea are nice but cost 10cents more per cup as compared to other coffeeshops",
