Rajen Arasu,5,"Utilised the SGH shuttle bus service from the clearly marked waiting area outside the Outram Park MRT Station's Eu Tong Sen Street public bus stop. Was there just before noon and had missed a shuttle bus, but another one arrived in less than 5 minutes. The shuttle bus is an essential service for senior  individuals or those with mobility issues, to ferry them from the MRT station to designated stops within the SGH complex and vice versa. Designated stops and frequency of the shuttle buses are clearly indicated at the embarkation / disembarkation points. Very evident that this shuttle bus service, operated by a pool of courteous and diligent drivers is heavily utilised.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113317460774650179369/reviews
Blackraven,5,"Bus stop is located opposite Outram Park MRT Exit #1. Bus comes around 20 minutes interval, might take longer during peak period. Friendly bus driver will bring me to specific SGH building skipping the heat. Free service for all, good for elderly people and children. Look at the map for specific stops of the Orange and Blue routes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114385515451710838076/reviews
Hock Heng Claudia Teo,1,"The shuttle bus time table as mentioned is 8am to 7pm.
This evening a few visitors were waiting around 635pm. NO ORANGE shuttle came .
One of the coach passes us at around 645pm BUT DO NOT STOP. May I know why? Please counsel your drivers. We rushed from work to see our love ones and they dont even care. They are irresponsible. This is my 2nd experience.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113773173935879927320/reviews
陈煜顺,1,"Why are there so few blue short-distance buses? I've been waiting for nearly 10 minutes. Four orange short-distance buses have passed by, but there is no blue short-distance bus. Where is your driver? I walk faster than waiting for your short-distance bus. Please add more corresponding short-distance buses.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110942838084868897393/reviews
