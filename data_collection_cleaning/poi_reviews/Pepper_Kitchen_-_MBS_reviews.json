The portion is generally good in size for a filling meal. For beef, one can add on the portion one desires n pay for it. Served with 2 side dishes, the menu combination is a delight.",

The rice is cooked perfectly and their food is quite mouth watering as it sizzles on the hot plate.\n\nThey serve a wide range of hot plate dishes - all freshly prepared in front of you! The line can get long but it moves fast and you won’t be waiting too long.\n\nThey are generous with their portions and their side condiments and sauces complements their dishes very well!",

      "text": "This food facility is embedded in the food court in marina bay sands shopping mall\n\nOMG the best steak\n\nI ordered the limited time raw rib eye steak cut(160g) with two extra eggs. I also asked for side of raw sliced beef. Served raw, cooking on a super hot sizzling iron plate with scoop of mashed potato, previously “frozen” corn kernels, the meat was perfectly seared on one side and you are supposed to flip meat and let it cook to your liking.  The best cut of meat melted deliciously in my mouth.\nThe rib eye steak 5/5 had a bit of flavorful butter on it it was one of the best steaks in my life\nThe regular sliced beef was only ok. 3.5/5\nMashed potato was creamy and nice 4/5\nCorn was standard 3/5 nothing special good enough\nEggs were done well crispy underside sunny side up 5/5\n\nIt came with a bowl of rice on side.\nI didn’t care for the two side sauces(soy garlic and sweet brown) 1/5) don’t spoil you beautiful meat with these below par sauces.",

      "text": "Tasty And Affordable!  I love that meals are served on a sizzling hot plate.  Their meats are tender and portion is good enough for the price you ar paying.  Sides are tasty too!  I like their mashed potato and sweet corn.  Waiting for your order could take a bit of time and for some reason you have to queue while waiting for your order.  Maybe they can use a buzzer system like what most food courts do.  Service is what you’d expect on a food court in Singapore.  This court is filled with tourists although there’s a ton of seats it can be a struggle to find one.",
