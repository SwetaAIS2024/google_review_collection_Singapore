Goh BC,5,"Hidden gem of Clementi. The scrambled egg was really good, and the coffee was on point too. I accidentally spilt the ice coffee of the half and half (which is very value for money). Shoutout to the staffs who cleaned up the sofa and floor rapidly and offered a replacement coffee. Pleasantly surprised and we will be back :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117556544293297216247/reviews

Faye Yap (Âè∂Ê†©ÁªØ),5,"The food here is literally AMAZING! üòã
I had the breakfast set, and literally every bite was scrumptious‚Äîthe bread was buttery, the tater tots were crispy, the scrambled eggs were creamy.

However, I do think that their matcha is pretty bad as it tasted too much like grass, even having the powdery texture while drinking. So that was pretty off putting.

Other than that, a really nice place to dine and chill to catch up with friends. Just that the price might be on the higher end (~$30 for a main and a drink)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101750484940912874032/reviews
JTalk 007,5,"I visited Monday Coffee Bar located at 209A Clementi Ave 6, and it was a delightful experience from start to finish! This cozy cafe has quickly become one of my favorite spots for brunch in the area.

I ordered the Daily Breakfast Set which is priced at $20.It was a generous portion that included crispy tater tots, flavorful German sausage, and perfectly scrambled eggs served with sourdough bread. The combination was not only delicious but also satisfying. I particularly loved the crispy texture of the tater tots and the savory taste of the sausage. The only thing I would change is having the sourdough bread served separately from the eggs, as I prefer to enjoy them individually.

The atmosphere of Monday Coffee Bar is another highlight. The cafe is beautifully designed with Japanese minimalist decor, featuring warm wooden tones and simple yet elegant furnishings that create a relaxing ambiance. It‚Äôs an ideal spot for catching up with friends or enjoying a quiet meal alone.

In addition to the great food, I found the service to be friendly and attentive. The staff made me feel welcome and were happy to answer any questions about the menu.

One practical aspect worth mentioning is the parking situation. Although I didn‚Äôt drive today, I noticed plenty of HDB parking spaces available within a short distance from the cafe. The rates are reasonable, making it convenient for those who do choose to drive.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101811590948255374199/reviews
