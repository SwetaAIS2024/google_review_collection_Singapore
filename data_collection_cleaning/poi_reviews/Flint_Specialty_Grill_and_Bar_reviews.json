      "text": "The newly renovated food court is really crowded!  I snagged a seat in front of Flint, so I figured I'd check it out.\n\nFirst, I got the ribeye with red wine sauce.  The steak was incredible (for a hawker outlet); it was delicious on its own, but the sauce really took it up a notch.\n\nThen I tried the smoked duck with pesto pasta. That pesto was so fresh-tasting, especially the basil.\n\nSince I was loving it, I ordered the grilled chicken chop with brown sauce.  It didn't disappoint.\n\nThey use black pepper in everything, which gives it a nice kick.  It was a really great and satisfying meal.",
