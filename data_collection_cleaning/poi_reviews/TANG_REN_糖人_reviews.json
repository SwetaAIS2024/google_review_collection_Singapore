      "text": "I had an awful experience at Tang Ren. We ordered the Mongolian Chicken Rice and it was absolutely horrible. The chicken tasted spoiled and had an unpleasant, watery texture. On top of that, the dish was way too sweet—completely off from what Mongolian chicken should taste like. The rice was a joke: bland, dry, and barely enough to call it a proper meal.\n\nThe entire dish felt like it had been thrown together with zero care. I left feeling disgusted and cheated. I don’t know what’s going on in their kitchen, but they seriously need to step up their game—or just stop serving this disaster altogether.\n\nAvoid this place at all costs!",

We have eaten many kaya butter toast in sg and Malaysia. This is the first time I feel so cheated for this particular toast. Take a look at the photo on the butter. I have never seen any kaya butter toast that look generous butter on the side and when I opened up the bread it tells an entire different story.\n\nThe wanton noodles is decent. I have eaten better ones in food court around JB.\n\nI definitely won't patronise again.",
