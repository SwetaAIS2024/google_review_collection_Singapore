      "text": "It's been a while since we visited this restaurant, and after this experience, I remembered why. Starting off with the positives - the HK style coffee and tea here tasted really great. Love the rich flavour and it didn't taste very sweet.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was a major disappointment. The toast was decent, but nothing special about it. The pork trotter noodles was really bad. The noodles had a very strong yellow noodle taste, and the pork trotters were mostly just bones. The wanton noodles was bland and lacked flavour, but overall better than the pork trotter noodles. We also ordered the HK fried noodles, which was a waste of money as it had very few ingredients and tasted underwhelming at best.\n\nService and environment of the restaurant were average. Given the overall experience, we probably won‚Äôt be returning.",

I have been eating this combination for yearsss here, really love it so much! Also if you sit in this restaurant, try their char siew, duck and pork belly combination. Must eat these with the signature sweet plum sauce! This is the best way for enjoying the meal. For the drink, try Horlick if you never try before. I brought my cousin here then they love Horlick so much!",

Ordered\n\n1) 3 combi platter\n2) zhu Chang fen (dough fritters) & vegetarian\n3) soy chicken rice\n4) lo Mai kai\n5) Siew Mai\n6) beef ball\n7) ee fu Mee\n8) char Siew soh\n\nGenerally the food here is okay.. not too bad and not very fantastic. Okay lor. The ambience is very Hong Kong like where it is noisy and lively as it is mother's day, the waiter that serves us (liao fang) wished us a happy mother's day and gave us a free green bean soup. She is very nice and gave us some menu recommendations which turns out to be good.\n\nOverall the food is okay, not very special not very bad.\n\nBut the service is really good. Shout out to liao fang for the service.",
