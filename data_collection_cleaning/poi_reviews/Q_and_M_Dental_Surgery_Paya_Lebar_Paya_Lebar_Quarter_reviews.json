      "text": "The first ever dentist who cannot tell the overall condition of my teeth without an xray. Kept insisting on an xray when I told her I don't need it. I'm just there for general cleaning and polishing. When I asked about how my teeth were looking overall, she said I can't tell without an xray. All the dentists that I been to were able to give me some good advise. You can tell that the dentist just wanted me to spend more on unnecessary xrays.",
