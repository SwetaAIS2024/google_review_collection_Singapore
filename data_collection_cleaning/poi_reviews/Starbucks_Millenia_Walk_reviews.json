I see an empty seat and as soon as I sit down the barista calls my name!\n\nAnd as it was the first time I used the app I got 50% off!\n\nThis location was also recently renovated so it's got nice chairs etc",

Most importantly, the place was always clean! Perhaps need some signs to ask the patrons to clean up the table after eating/drinking. Cleaning after people is not any baristaâ€™s job.",
