Tan Lu yi,5,"One of the best Thai food place I've been to in sg so far. The food was good ! especially the fish, I usually don‚Äôt really like fish but this is really fresh and crispy the sauce was very good too. The green curry was very fragrant and the beef was tender, very flavourful and creamy for the curry. Their clear tom yam has so many ingredient in it and the flavour was fantastic enough spicy and enough sourness too. Even the stuff chicken wing was very good. The desserts are good , not too sweet and very good especially the taco, mango sticky rice, Tapioca and the tang yuan. Totally worth coming!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101641743426264216153/reviews
Carol Tan,3,"Food was kind of disappointing.. only the green curry was acceptable.
Filling for stuffed wings and the fried fish slices with black sauce unappetising.
Vegetables very plain.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102370094698562218614/reviews
Stella,5,"Even though there were numerous signs stating 'No outside food & drinks allowed' throughout the restaurant, the staff was very accommodating and allowed people to do this. See the photo; the couple purchased two coconuts from Fairprice and orange juice from iJooz. I was curious, so I approached the staff; they were aware but not opposed to it. I suppose I can bring my own food and eat here next time, as there is a free seat and table! üëç",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114857297531246209563/reviews
Douglas Tan,5,"One of the best and authentic Thai food you can find in Singapore. Highly recommended, should try out their Prawn Tamarind Sauce, Green Curry, Phad Thai etc. Their desserts were amazing too! (see pic).

Lyn (Ê∑ã),4,"I was craving some good Thai food, and Jai Siam sounded perfect since it's right next to the NTUC (super convenient!).

The food was decent, don't get me wrong. But for the price, I was expecting a bit more.

Maybe we were just extra hungry, but the portions seemed a tad on the small side compared to what we were expecting. Still tasty though! Just gotta factor that in next time we decide on Thai for lunch.

Note: My photos are zoomed in.

Tips below üëá

Portion Patrol: I might have to do some recon on reviews beforehand to see if portion sizes are consistently on the smaller side.

Ask about upsizing options! Some restaurants might offer a bigger portion for a small additional cost.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105664369630463226540/reviews
