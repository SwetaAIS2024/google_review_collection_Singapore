      "text": "Himawari ‚Äì The Japanese buffet I didn‚Äôt want to tell you about.\n\nLook, I really wanted to gatekeep this one‚Äîbut good food deserves a little spotlight. Himawari Japanese Restaurant quietly delivers one of the most satisfying Japanese buffet experiences out there, and I‚Äôm still dreaming of that sashimi.\n\nLet‚Äôs start with the Shabu Shabu. The broth starts off soft and light, but after a good simmer? It transforms into this comforting, umami-rich hotpot that hits the spot‚Äîespecially after you‚Äôve gone ham on the sashimi.\n\nAnd speaking of sashimi‚Äîfresh, chunky, generous. No sad slivers here. The tako sashimi had me going back for seconds (and thirds), and the variety? Definitely punches above its price point.\n\nSoft shell crab came out cold‚Äîhard pass. I enjoyed the grilled shishamo, but the fried version didn‚Äôt quite hit. The fried stuff, especially the tempura, is a must-try though‚Äîlight, crisp, and all kinds of satisfying.\n\nSushi is okay, and I found the handrolls not too exciting. So unless you‚Äôre a diehard, maybe don‚Äôt waste precious stomach real estate there.\n\nAnd now for dessert: they only offer four ice cream flavours, but these come in individual tubs and taste like the good stuff‚Äînot cheap, fluffy filler. It‚Äôs a classy little ending to a full-on feast.\n\nHonestly, I didn‚Äôt have enough stomach to try everything‚Äîbut what I did manage to devour was seriously worth it.\n\nVerdict: An underrated gem for Japanese buffet lovers. Great quality, comforting hotpot, and a satisfying sweet finish. Come hungry, pace yourself, and maybe‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs keep this one hush-hush.",

The restaurant atmosphere was good, not too many tables hence the crowds wasn't too large.  The service by the staffs team were good. We enjoyed the evening. Serving speed was fast even with the restaurant crowded. Car parking was easy. Pricing was reasonable for the spread they provided. Will plan to revisit soon.",
