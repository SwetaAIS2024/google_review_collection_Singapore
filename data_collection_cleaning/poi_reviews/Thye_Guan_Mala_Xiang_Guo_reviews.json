Lastly a piece of advice, you have to chase them if you waited too long, as I was in the queue first and waited patiently for my foods and I ended the last one to receive my foods. Just because I didnâ€™t chase themâ€¦Their service donâ€™t even deserve a star at all.",

When I go back home, to my shock, there was so much peanut in it ! This is a big deal because Iâ€™m literally allergic to peanuts. I would rather her take out the peanuts than plucking out the coriander ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘.\nShe also doesnâ€™t know how to pack properly, and the food is all slanted in the plastic bag.\nPrefer the older female aunty which can adhere to my requirements properly.\nThis new staff also charged me 50cents more than what the aunty would charge meâ€¦..",

Cheater and scammer. Not only short change customer the taste of the chicken pot $35 totally different. Chicken is uncooked and all bone today. Totally no ethics. In the end I throw away. Less oil also become more oil. If you want to waste money to ruin your day go ahead and order.\n\nThis is not the first time they do this scam No more order from here.\n\nIf I can give zero star I will.",

      "text": "Price is incredibly increasing!\nI used to take food below $12 included 2 rice. Recently, same portion of food became $14-16 since 3months ago! On last week, I ordered the same with 2rice, she only gave 1 rice when I collecting. So I declared and ask her to check the receipt on machine and TOLD ME MINE WAS WITHOUT RICE SO I NEED TO ADD ON FOR RICE. I ask her to show me the receipt she looked at just now, she look again and SAID IT WAS NOT MY RECEIPT. This really doesn't make any sense!! Also, mala at other place will show u when they weight, but this never! I wonder how much COMMISSION the woman self collect each month? Its really not trust worthy store.",
