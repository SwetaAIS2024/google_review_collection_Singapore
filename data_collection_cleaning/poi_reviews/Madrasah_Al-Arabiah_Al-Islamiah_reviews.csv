Benny Tucker,1,"I attended Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah for 4 years and was disappointed by the lack of resources and qualifications of the teaching staff. The facilities were made to seem advanced however it was not, they advertised that they had a VR room however we never used VR equipment in that room. This school also had limited funding for books and supplies, which made it challenging for students to fully engage in their learning. Additionally, I encountered a high number of teachers who were unqualified or ineffective in their teaching methods. While there are some good teachers that really care about students, they are the exception not the norm. A teacher once told me that the earth revolves around the moon and not the other way around. He also said that dinosaurs did not exist and that the fossils of them are faked to hide the truth of flying horses.These types of teachers and these facilities of no utilities  made it difficult for me to get the support I needed to succeed academically. I hope that in the future,  Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah will invest in its facilities and teacher training to provide a better educational experience for students.
