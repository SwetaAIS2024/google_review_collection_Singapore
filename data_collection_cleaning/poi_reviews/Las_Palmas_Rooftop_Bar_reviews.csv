Kirthi Kashini276,5,"A Must-Visit Bar with Exceptional Cocktails!

I had an amazing experience at Las Palmas Bar, and a huge part of that was thanks to Karenthyna, the incredibly talented bartender. She didn‚Äôt just serve drinks‚Äîshe crafted her own signature cocktails, each one more delicious and addictive than the last. You can tell she has a deep knowledge of mixology, as she explained every ingredient and technique with passion.

The atmosphere at Las Palmas is vibrant yet cozy, making it the perfect spot for a night out. But what truly sets it apart is the top-notch service and the creativity behind the bar. If you‚Äôre looking for a place with unique, expertly made cocktails and a bartender who knows her craft inside out, Karenthyna is the one to look for!

I‚Äôll definitely be coming back for more! Highly recommend!

Michael Wu PhD,5,"the pool is not big, but the restaurant and bar area are very nice. If you stay at the hotel you can use the pool and the cabana, otherwise you will have to spend a minimum of 300. The food was ok, but the drinks and the view are great.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105061099394492403376/reviews
Kean // keanmono IG & TT,5,"Chill out at one of the best rooftop bars with an amazing panoramic sunset view of Singapore's cityscape!

As part of Las Palmas 2nd Anniversary, we were treated to a Magic After Dark party where it was an evening of fun, spectacular drinks and delectable bites.

Really loved the limited edition Tropical Spell cocktail which comes in a pretty bronze cup in the shape of a pineapple and you can even bring it home! Taste features dark rum and other tropical flavours fit for a refreshing drink by the infinity pool.

During the party, we took part in an engaging hands-on Cocktail Masterclass and a DIY Gin and Tonics selection, learning about the different spirits and of course enjoying the drinks! These delightful activities can also be arranged for private events.

It was a totally wonderful experience at Las Palmas and you have to gather some friends to come enjoy the awesome vibes, sip stunning cocktails while soaking in the beautiful sunset view!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110201119911939984946/reviews
