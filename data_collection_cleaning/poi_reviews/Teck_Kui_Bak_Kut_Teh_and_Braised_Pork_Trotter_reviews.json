At $6.50 per bowl comes with 2 thick and juicy pork loin.\n\nGreat tasting soup that‚Äôs refillable.\nI also love the fact that they minced up their garlic.\n\nI personally felt that their quality rivals SongFa but at a much more affordable pricing.",

      "text": "Came by for lunch on a weekend. Found this rather interesting new stall . Ordered the mixed parts collagen soup, Kong Pao pig trotters, preserved veg along with rice.\nThe white collagen soup based is the same soup based on all their other dishes like the kway chap. The soup itself is similar to other collagen soup from steam boat stall but on the lighter side and peppery. The other ingredients found in the soup  belly shabu, stomach and small intestine were prepared well.\nTheir Kong Pao pig trotters is also a different take from the usual. The gravy is less thick, you find the dried chilli and it has some Sichuan peppers. What I like is in my bowl, they gave meaty pieces along with the bony trotters part.\nThe preserved veg tasted less salty than others and you get a nice garlicky aroma with it.\nWill definitely come back couple of months later and check if they can make the collagen soup slightly more robust.",

      "text": "We all love traditional black version kway chap, the herbal within it is so aromatic.\n\nThen we found this stall, they have BKT, Pork Trotters and the only stall in SG (I guess) that sell one of a kind *White Kway Chap*. White version of kway chap sounds so interesting. Order 1 bowl at $5.50 for sharing. They serve quite big portion with alot of kway.\n\nThey use bkt broth with nice herbal and peppery taste that's neither too strong nor too light. Kway(ccf style) is very thin and smooth but firm bite. Comes with intestine, stomach, lean meat and ‰∫îËä±ËÇâ. Their  Âí∏Ëèú is also well-cooked which is non salty at all and very ÂºÄËÉÉ. Overall, excellent broth excellent taste. Finished till the last drop and will be back again.\n\nüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã",
