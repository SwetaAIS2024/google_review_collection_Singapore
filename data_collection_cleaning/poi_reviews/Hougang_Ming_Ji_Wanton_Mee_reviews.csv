AStonedSeal,5,"Ming Ji Wanton Mee has been my constant place to get my breakfast / lunch.

$4 for a basic wanton noddle set. Higher price for fancier one but all still under $10 per pax 4sure.

Great wanton mee. Lovely soup, hardworking folks. Give it a try. Will not disappoint. Just maybe differed type of wanton style from you had personally.

I hope they keep going! Positive employees.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105805778856423824883/reviews
