James Ang,5,"Classic neighbourfood roasted place, but additionally they have all kinds of heartland food options like economic beehoon with various add-ons.

Super value for money; only $5.20 for beehoon, curry vegetable, luncheon meat with a kopi-O!

Tried their wanton mee with Kopi-O on a separate day. Only $4.80! Hahaha I love Singapore heartland food ",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100655878992435360282/reviews
