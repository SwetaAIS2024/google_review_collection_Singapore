Ying Ma,5,"Many thanks to Teacher Monica for her patience and efforts in guiding my girls to appreciate music. I am not someone who chase after piano exams because I think helping the kids sustain their interests in music is more meaningful, but Teacher Monica is good at focusing on the important foundations and making learning fun while covering the exam skills, killing two birds with one stone. This year my girls took their first ever piano exams in life, and both obtained their Distinctions. One of them got almost perfect scores for Grade 3. More importantly, they have enjoyed learning piano and never dread it with all the guidance from Teacher Monica. We are grateful for that!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113489048355901095028/reviews
Jodie Luu,5,"Teacher Monica has been teaching my kids ever since they started their piano journey when they were around 5 years old. She understands the strengths and weaknesses of each child and knows how to motivate them. More than just learning how to play the piano, the kids are learning how to play elegantly. I also greatly appreciate her flexibility and agility in moving the piano lessons online during the circuit breaker period to minimize any disruption to the kids' learning momentum. My kids enjoy their piano lessons and are also happy to practice almost everyday at home. Overall, it has been a positive experience thus far.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113204817962053070364/reviews
Xue Bai,5,"As an adult student, I have been learning piano with teacher Monica for 7 years and achieved ABRSM Grade 6 so far. Teacher Monica is not only my piano teacher but also friend who is always encouraging me for my piano study and also sharing with me useful parental tips. Two years ago, my daughter started her piano journey with her too. She enjoys taking lessons with teacher Monica from the very beginning. Her distinct teaching technique keeps my daughter progress steadily. She is a kind and caring teacher who likes to give kids stickers and small rewards whenever they show improvement.

I highly recommend teacher Monica as a music teacher for any adult or child who wishes to learn.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104308780545892076411/reviews
