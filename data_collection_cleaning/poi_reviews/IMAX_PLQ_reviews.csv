I am Shiela,5,Space was just right and the big screen has good resolution that captures all the right spots but I would recommend sitting not too close for better viewing. The place and chairs were clean and comfy and it's very close to the restrooms which were also very clean and well-maintained. Would go back for a good movie next time..,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102240643710713485179/reviews
