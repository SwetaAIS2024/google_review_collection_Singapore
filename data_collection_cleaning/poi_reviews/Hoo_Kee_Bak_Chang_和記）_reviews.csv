j,5,"I received Hoo Keeâ€™s hokkien rice dumpling and K*m Ch**â€™s nyonya rice dumpling as gifts. I steamed both on the same plate for 25 mins in the same rice cooker. Just comparing the dryness, Hoo Keeâ€™s dumplings had the right amount of moisture, while KCâ€™s one was a little too dry inside. The rice was especially fragrant and they were so generous with the portion of ingredients in the hokkien dumpling. Ingredients used were well-seasoned as well. My entire family is Team nyonya rice dumpling but they absolutely loved this. Grandma even asked me to buy more back for her closer to Dragon Boat Festival ðŸ¤—",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116533979878880476490/reviews
Ruth Ng,5,Hidden Gem. The Bak Chang here may be smaller in size compares to other places. But the quality is definitely better. What you pay is what you get. I bought the $4 & $6 ones to see the difference. Will definitely buy again!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100445000743705986908/reviews
Alvin Choo,5,"This is the only bak chang in Singapore that I bother to buy, because once you have tasted it, everything else just pales in comparison. Although it's $6 a piece for the one with all the ingredients, I think it's still worth it given how everything else has increased in price as well.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
Steven Chow,1,Did a pre-order of 2 dumplings a few days in advance as I wanted to get for my dad. However got a call back from the shop that MOQ is 10 cause near to the festival . This is the first time I come across this. Quite disappointed they donâ€™t want to take small ordersâ€¦,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107985246054805441513/reviews
TAN SH,5,"Bought tdy. Served by 2 senior ladies. The outlook of the shop is v nostalgic n traditional type. Bought the ""green"" type.

Was delighted when i saw the fillings inside. Worth my trip n definitely the price. Ingredients was of the right amount in ratio to the rice. Some bak zhangs too much rice n little fillings. Hoo Kee uses lean meat which I liked. Taste was just right. Strong fragrant bak zhang smell once I pry open it ðŸ˜Š.

Thank you for carrying on the tradition and selling the bak zhang at an economically reasonably price in midst of the economy where everything prices shot up.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103256791921178972576/reviews
