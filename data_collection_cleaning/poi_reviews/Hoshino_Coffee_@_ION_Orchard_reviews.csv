Sonja S,4,"Nice japanese café at ION.
Had the soufflee pancake with berries. Was delicious and not dry like other reviews here of course a sauce is needed so don't order a plain pancake . Sandwich was also good. And Mille Crepes was also nice.

Would come again :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105620019421665045797/reviews
Yenleng Tan,1,"I had the beef curry omurice and it was DISGUSTING. The dish came 15 mins after the first one and by then my mum's food is no longer hot.

The egg on the omurice was just an enlarged egg white. Compared to your menu where the egg actually looks like an egg, it seems like the chefs made it out of egg white instead? And to my horror when i cut in ITS LITERALLY FOAM?? It literally tastes like im eating foam. And after that my dish was flooded with WATER thats probably from the egg. How can you call yourself a japanese establishment when your main dish omu rice tastes like this? As expected the egg white tastes of nothing.

Dish was also served on a chipped plate.

French toast was the saving grace. My mun also commented that her dish which was the curry pot was not bad too.

I am thoroughly disappointed, wont be returning again. Google reviews are low for a reason.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107215486807043403262/reviews
Rachael,3,"we totally expected to wait a while for our food given the recent reviews, but surprisingly our dishes were all served within 15mins despite the full house! portions were generous, but food could have been better seasoned.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103770313950666742733/reviews
Anastasia Larkina,3,"I had a lunch set and it was rather good. Not being a huge fan of Japanese food, I might be a little biased. The omelette was good,  beef was a little more fatty than expected. Matcha was nice. Everything was served in no time.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117389662623700867052/reviews
Ethan Ong Wee Tiong,5,"Repeated visits before this review. Ordered the Omu rice n teriyaki chicken steak with salad (100g) lunch set and “Hoshino” spaghetti with eggplant, shimeji, bacon n sausage, and the mini soup (Homard Bisque). Had iced coffee with milk n sugar. Prefer this to the hot Hoshino coffee, as this iced coffee has a strong taste n really has a kick. Not a fan of iced coffee n this is the only one that satisfy. Swee Ling is very friendly, n also observant to notice that we needed to change seats due to weak mobile signal. Thanks to Swee Ling n the little girl assistant Clarice for the service.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112485984526390357369/reviews
