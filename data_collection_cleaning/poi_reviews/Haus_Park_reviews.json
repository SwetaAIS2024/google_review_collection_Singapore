      "text": "Great place to have a short jog or walk and yet be able to enjoy the sunlight while u have ur routine.\n\nThis location is one of the long exercise park instead of a big park. One of the unique parks we have seen around. For a unique park like this, this will be a good place to work on static exercises. You can your journey starting from the underpass, have a warming up walk towards d end of park and plan your exercise work out. Once you reach the open area of the machines available or just the sitting area, you can start exercising.\n\nIt is a good way to work out and yet use the timing to ur own benefit. Body weight exercises are always in trend no matter when n where. U can then restart or end the exercise routine by walking pass the lush flowers and leaves brushing past by u.\n\nIf u get d right timing, this place is definitely a lovely place to work out with ur love ones.. Check the timing out urself üòÅ\n\nCheers!!",
