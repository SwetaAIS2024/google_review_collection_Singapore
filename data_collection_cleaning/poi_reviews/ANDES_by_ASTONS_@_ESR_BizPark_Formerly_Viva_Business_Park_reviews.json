I guess cause they use the sauce for taste rather than salt & pepper. Fried chicken cutlet was juicy, sides were great as well. What was good was that the portions were great for me.\n\nService though was slow, waited about 30 mins for my meal, might be because they were understaffed. Was difficult to get them to refill water too.",

When we feedback to the waiter to ask the kitchen to check if there was any issue (as it didnâ€™t taste as bad previously when we came), the waiter simply dismissed us by asking us to give our feedback on Google review. The standard has simply gone done so much and so hereâ€™s the Google review as requested by them",

Food is usually consistent and tasty, sometimes a little more burnt under the chicken, or like todayâ€™s fish, hard on one end :/ (forgot to take fish photo) Too generous with the chili packets but at least I wonâ€™t throw it.\nCashier lady and waiter Uncle were friendly, but if prices are friendlier I would come more often! ðŸ¤­",
