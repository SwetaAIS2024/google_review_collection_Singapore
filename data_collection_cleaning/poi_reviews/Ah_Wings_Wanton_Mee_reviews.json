      "text": "April 2025: I had just finished a 10 km hike and was craving for wantan noodles.  There were 15 people waiting ahead of me even though I came at 1115 hrs. When it was my turn, I ordered the char siew wantan noodle $5 and a bowl of dumpling soup for $5. I asked for 1 piece of chicken feet and paid an extra $1.50. Maybe I was polite, and the owners gave me an extra piece. The soup was delicious,  full of anchovy flavours.  The dumplings have pieces of prawns in them. The char siew was moist, but I wished that they could have been fattier. The wantans were delicious.  The noodles were springy but had a bicarbonate soda taste, which disappeared when mixed with the chilli sauce. This is certainly a favourite stall of mine, even though I don't like the food centre, a bit warm and small. It closes on Monday,  Thursday, and Friday. There's a bubble tea stall almost close to it, and the drinks were refreshing and cheap.",

      "text": "Good old fashioned Cantonese style hofan & noodles. Good wanton & dumplings! Braised chicken feet & mushrooms is nice too ! Soup is light & sweet. Home made charsiew is tasty and not fattening.\nAlways long queue. Reasonably priced. Most popular stall in the center. Closed on Monday.\nUpdated 23th Nov 2024\nTried their wanton hofun soup with chicken feet today !!!! Nice !!! ü•∞üòòüëçüòç\nI prefer their soup rather than dry noodles and hofan .\nThey sell frozen dumplings and wanton too ! (Last pic.)\nTo avoid long queuing time come after 2pm.\n\n15 April 2025 just came back from holiday really missed it ! Came at 1:30pm no queue quickly ordered a big bowl of horfun soup ! Nice !! Unfortunately no more chicken feet !",

Distinctive Cantonese flavour, generous servings and most importantly, hand made Wanton and Shrimp dumplings is heavenly made! Spoke to the owner and he is very courteous and pleasant. Can‚Äôt give full marks for atmosphere as it‚Äôs a typical hawker centre. Do note the limited opening days and timings if u wish to try! Will certainly return for more!",

      "text": "I ordered their Char Siew and Wanton Noodle ($5) , accompanied by a serving of Dumpling Soup for an additional $5 which comes with 5 huge pieces .\n\nThe noodles, famed for their authentic Hong Kong-style preparation, boast a satisfying springiness and are generously coated in a harmonious blend of sauces. The char siew topping is expertly charred to perfection, with thick slices showcasing a gradient of dark to light hues.\n\nComplementing the noodles are plump and succulent handmade dumplings, generously filled with a flavorful mixture of minced pork, shrimp, and black fungus. The thin dumpling skin provides a delightful contrast to the rich filling, resulting in an explosion of flavors with each bite. And let's not forget about the wantons‚Äîthey're insanely good too, adding an extra layer of deliciousness to this already stellar dish.\n\nThis offering from Ah Wing's Wanton Mee is a definite must-try, delivering a perfect harmony of taste and texture.\n\n---Pro Tip---\nQueue: There's a queue formed before opening hour but it moves fast once it opens.\n\nPayment: QR code payments and cash available.\n\nTakeaway: Frozen wantons and dumplings are available for purchase.",
