Eric Ng,5,"Very humble store in a hawker centre helmed by a very friendly order taker and a great chef who dishes up simple hor fan (with great wok hei). The price is very reasonable and the dishes are great.

Don't expect restaurant ambience but for hawker centre San Lou Hor Fan, uts outstanding. You can ask for their crispypork lard bits too.

Highly recommended and will visit again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115480430589749990521/reviews
Wee Ting Khow,5,"$6 per dish and takeout is 30 cents per box. Very tender beef slices and thick fish slices without skin. Hor fun has wok hei and very good elastic texture, not mushy or undercooked.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115232150410365122372/reviews
Wei Kang Chin,5,The beef hor fun and seafood fried rice are very delicious and the wok hei is definitely there. Value for money and CDC voucher is accepted too.

sulin lau,5,"Not able to decide which hor fun to try, I greedily ordered the option ‚Äúwith everything‚Äù - fish slices, beef slices, prawns. And added an extra egg.

I knew I was in for a treat when I saw the giant licks of wok hey flames üî• üî•dwarfing even the cook himself and filling the entire kitchen.

I also watched him cook each protein separately - fish slices, beef slices, prawns, and finally an egg droppped into sauce, and crunchy bean sprouts to finish.

Of course it took longer to cook, but damb was it worth the wait. A smoky char is evident from your very first spoonful - permeating the sauce and the hor fun noodles. All 3 proteins were pitch perfect, with that juicy just-barely-cooked texture.

With extra egg, just $6.70. Simple food made exceedingly well, a total joy",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113631111920883685352/reviews
