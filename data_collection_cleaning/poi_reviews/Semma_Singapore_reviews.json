The service was quick and the staff were responsive. Had a pleasant experience, would return! Do join their membership programme if you would like a free shot on the house.",

      "text": "Decided to try this food joint for lunch. Tried a variety of dishes (Prata, mutton, prawn, biriyani, Madras tea). Pleasantly surprised with the pleasing minimalistic setup. The ambiance was good. Ordered the food and It was a surprise to see quick Service. Did not have to wait long at all. Coming to food ... The best was\nthe amazingly soft Roti Parata (Plain, Egg, cheese). Pepper Prawn was just awesome. Not spicy but it had the right blend of taste. Gravy was good with Parata. Also had Mysore mutton, again the gravy was good. mutton was a bit hard and pieces were chunky,  not as great as I expected.  Biryani was just average. Last but not the least, the Madras tea. It was well made. Perfect tasting tea to go with the food.\nOverall it was good experience.",
