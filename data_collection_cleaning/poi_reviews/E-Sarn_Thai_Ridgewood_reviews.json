      "text": "Vegetarian food availability: 2 stars.\nThere is vegetarian food available but it tastes sbad.\n\nHorrendous food. Tastes very bland.\nWe visited this restaurant as there was numerous reviews stating its excellent service but we were incredibly disappointed. Its unauthentic flavour made us dislike this place along with its sky rocketed price. We ordered the tom yum soup which was incredibly bland. It was sweetish and really felt like dessert more than tom yum soup. The Thai Green Curry was incredibly thin in texture. It was bland and there was no spice. Exorbitant price was also charged for the small portion they gave. 14 dollars for that pile of unseasoned food was not worth it. The tempura was   not even seasoned well. The chendol was horrible and an insult to Thai cuisine. It did not even have shaved ice. There was just plain solid blocks of ice.\nThe servings is small, the service is inefficient, the taste is horrendous and the cost was exorbitant. They do not have much vegetarian options too.\nI will never visit this place again for sure.",

None of those Instagramable BS.\n\nThis is the only place where I like how the dish, ‚Äúbeef pad see ew‚Äù (fried kway teow) is done. No other place suffice. My staples are‚ù§Ô∏è: pomelo salad, homemade fried spring roll,  pandan chicken wings, Thai veg omelette, and beef pad see ew.\n\nDine with more people in order to share and try more dishes.
