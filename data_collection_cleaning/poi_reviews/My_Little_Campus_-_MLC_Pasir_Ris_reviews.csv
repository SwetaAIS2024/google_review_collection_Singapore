Thuat nguyen minh,5,"Highly appreciated.
My first child has joined My Little Campus about 10 months ago when he was 2 years old. As a foreigner, I and my wife don’t know much about Singapore and the education program here. We had so worried at beginning to put him in school where the environment complete different from our origin country. But it was an amazing journey at My Little Campus for us since the first day still now.
My son has had the opportunity to engage in a diverse range of activities that have greatly contributed to his development. From learning colouring to mastering the skill of tracing letters, the curriculum has been thoughtfully designed to stimulate his creativity and fine motor skills. Equally important, the guidance provided on social interaction and playing with friends has helped him build essential social skills and team-play. I appreciate the well-rounded approach to education that the school provides, fostering not only academic growth but also valuable life skills.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111138528758604066674/reviews
Charyl Chan,5,"My girl started playgroup at MLC just one month ago, and in just 2 weeks she is no longer crying during drop off and pick up. Even walk into school herself, waving bye to me!

Not only that she has learn to be much more independent, wanting to eat on her own during mealtimes, and wants to walk on her own to school every morning.

It’s amazing how the teachers at MLC Pasir Ris teach the children!

Teachers are great and friendly too!

Not forgetting Principle Agnes, who is quick in responding and very efficient! And make sure my girl is doing well in school during the first few weeks!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101763402722705839421/reviews

I'm so happy with MLC Pasir Ris. The principal, teachers, and parents all work together to understand each child and help them grow. They've really helped my child become more independent and confident. And you know what? My child really, really likes going to this school and always tells me about it! I'm thankful for how they take care of my child and I think other parents will like it too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118375945530929131414/reviews
Jocelyn,5,"My girl attended My Little Campus (Pasir Ris) since she was a toddler. Now she is going to graduate soon. I have witnessed how my girl had grown to be independent, learning so many new things and enjoyed going to school. The teachers there are so so nice and always updating us my girl's progress. She had close relationship with the teacher's there and always told us she love her teachers so much. No regrets choosing My Little Campus (Pasir Ris)!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105394278703562161759/reviews
