Before attending this tuition centre, I have been struggling with math and science. After attending this tuition centre my parents and I could see a huge improvement in my results. There is also a reward system to encourage students to do better. Thus, I recommend Star Treasure to any parents looking for an amazing tuition centre",

      "text": "Ms Tan (Math, Amath n Physics Teacher) puts in a lot of effort into making sure each and everyone of her student understands the subject well and does not just teach formulas only. She makes understanding methods easy by giving us relatable examples that are not only lucid but also effective in explaining how the method works. Ms Tan shows passion in her teaching as she cares for every student, this is shown through her action by encouraging us and checking on us frequently. She is also very flexible in terms of tuition times and I feel very comfortable to switch lessons alternatively since she teaches all 3 subjects. Whenever I have a question or stuck on a problem at home, a quick message to Ms Tan and she can get back to me within minutes. Overall, Ms Tan is a compassionate and effective teacher that can pull grades up if effort from the student is also put in!",
