Maria T,5,"Had an amazing night out at Luni with my husband! The drinks, the food, the whole vibe ‚Äî everything was spot on. The medium-rare steak was *chef‚Äôs kiss* and really proved that great bars can also serve great food.
But honestly, the real star was the scent/essential oil-infused cocktails. So unique and super well-made! Xan, the bartender, is clearly passionate about what he does and it really showed in the drinks and the way he talked about the whole concept.
If you‚Äôre looking for a fun, different experience, Luni is *the* place to go. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116264055153062131613/reviews
Lorraine T,5,"Your olfactory senses activated the moment you step in, in the most lovely soothing way. Scent-sational cocktails. Appreciate that there's a washroom right in their space as compared to the old Apartment coffee where you had to head back out for a public bathroom. Lovely lighting. Good music for a Sat night tho a tad loud if you're seated near the speakers. Best Espresso martini - you can actually taste the coffee instead of artificial liquor sweetness. All praise for this place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100765991992046713300/reviews
Noel Huang,5,"Went to Luni on a rainy evening, this scent inspired bar was incredibly cozy and so happened they had Thai kitchen takeover which I love!

The owner and bartenders here are really attentive and friendly, you might just end up becoming friends  or staying long than expected.

It's really nice to see Zack's passion for scent and attention to detail coming fruition in this bar. üçª Thanks for the amazing night.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117294615995197685380/reviews
Janice Lee,5,"I found out about a very interesting and unique place when I signed up for Cocktail Making Class. Turns out the place is Lun√¨ - Scent, Bar & Kitchen. Yes, my first thought is what has scent got to do with bar and kitchen? But knowing that there is a kitchen cemented my decision to go for the class with empty stomach so that I can try the food here. I will also see how scent plays a part in the whole experience.

Actually, aroma always plays a very important part in gastronomy, but more of accompaniment to taste. And at Lun√¨, this element takes the center stage instead, and it works beautifully. The cosy, stylish bar, with lots of soft glowing lights, is lightly filled with aroma of lemongrass, amping up that cosy feeling.

The essential oils, infused into the cocktails, take things up a notch with the enjoyment of the drinks. I‚Äôm usually not into bitters, but at here, with the sweet aroma added, I totally dig it due to the good balance of bitter taste and sweetness from the aroma. The other cocktails are also unique and so good on the palates. Yes, aromas do enhance the taste of the cocktails, by a mile.

The food here is delicious, which is why I suggest coming here with some room in the stomach. The food menu is well thought-out, with simulating flavours to juxtapose perfectly with the cocktails while not eclipsing the delicate aromas of the drinks.

The service here is excellent. The bartenders and service staff are all so friendly and prompt to action. Xen, the sensei for Cocktail Making session makes it fun with the casual easy vibe. He is so knowledgeable, thus sharing with us the history and origins of cocktails, making the experience even better. And the part about locking the true aroma of mint, it is so eye-or-nose opening. This us a must-try experience.

Truffle Angel Hair Pasta with Scallops and Ikura is so briny sweet, with a hint of zest to perk up the taste. This dish is special in which the pasta has this curly and slightly firm, chewy texture, like it had been lightly deep fried beforehand. I like this unique texture.

Grilled Tiger Prawns is a must-try here. The prawns and broccolini are perfectly grilled to have that rich, intense aroma and taste of char, while retaining the creamy texture and juicy core respectively. The char is very pronounced, being top notes of the flavours yet having none of the bitterness.

To top it off, the sauce of passion fruit and yoghurt is creamy and tangy, contrasting so well with the char and elevating the taste.

Ember cocktail surprises me with its bitter taste that I actually like! Bitters is not my thing, but this drink catches my fancy with its sweet aroma and smooth feel. Yes, aroma makes a difference here.
