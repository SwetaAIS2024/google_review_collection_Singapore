Radziah A K,5,The food is good and I really like it that they make 100 percent effort to include kid’s meals in their menu. Even having the option to separate the sauces (considering some kids are picky eaters). Good job! Will definitely continue to support such restaurants!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110592152982512929323/reviews
memoir06,2,Bought NASI LEMAK GEPREK for lunch today and my spice level is 8. The Nasi Lemak tasted of rancid coconut milk. I ate cheap nasi lemak before but none taste like this. So horrible that I have to threw away the rice. Fortunately the chicken is good to eat. Please use better quality coconut milk.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108869389316149620316/reviews
Sten (Piqued Wanderer),5,"If your taste buds need some kick, this is it!

Papa Ayam serves choices especially in terms of spice level. Many variations, even up to 15 or more.. the best part of it lal, it is Halal!.... Let's dive in!

Food:
Yummy is one that cant avoid.. hahaha.. it's nice meal to have, although there are no seating area dedicated for this shop.

Service:
Rather fast and steady flow. Staff seems to be friendly but we guess they are still adapting to the needs of the new venue.

Atmosphere:
Since OTH is already a vibrant place, it builds up on this. The whole area looks funky and bright. Hip and trendy as well yeah

Overall, the place looks like a fastfood place to be at. It would be best if it was a seated restaurant type.. but it works too.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115011929186540431052/reviews
