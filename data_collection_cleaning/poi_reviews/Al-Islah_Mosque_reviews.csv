Nur Iman Rostam,5,"Masjid Al-Islah of Punggol is a beauty in its right and the architecture of this amazing mosque resonated with my impression. It looks as if it had travelled from the future back to the present and landed on a 'floating' pedestal. The red-pinkish theme of the mosque gives it an air of elegance without the need for additional decoration.

Buses 117, 119, 381 and 382 run from Punggol Temporary Bus Interchange to bus stop no. 65341 (Opposite Block 272C) which is a few metres past the mosque. Or you could get down at PE1 Cove or PTC Punggol on the Punggol LRT and take a walk towards the direction of the mosque along Punggol Field.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110287485091231667131/reviews
ABDULLAH CHOWDHURY,4,"It's a nice mosque (Sunni) located at Punggol. Spacious place, disciplined but the Khutba is on Maley language.

You can pray 5 times prayer and Froday Jummah. Precisely It's on the area of COVE. You cab pick LRT/ bus to reach there.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113175102174585558696/reviews
HampterLikesKebabz,5,"This mosque is very modern and clean. It has a total of 4 levels and the parking lot is used for solat jumaah. The staff here r very kind and would smt give food and beverages to students who come for solat jumaah. The toilets r really clean and there is a lot of places to take ur wudhu. This mosque also has religious classes (madrasah) which u can take for ur kids. The cafe food here is really nice. It’s well ventilated and the top floors got air con. The cons of this mosque is that smt the roads around the mosque gets congested and may not be enough seats for people to solat jumaah although its big. When there is not enough seats many people would have to wait outside the mosque to solat. If lucky, they may have a seat when readjusting for solat. Not only that, students would have troubles going back to their school bc it would be really congested. Secondly, some of the students here that come for solat jumaah r irresponsible they play with the water in the wudhu area. The cons here r not bc of the mosque but it’s just abt the people using the services here. Overall it’s a good mosque and I come here every Friday!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113645902962709038355/reviews
