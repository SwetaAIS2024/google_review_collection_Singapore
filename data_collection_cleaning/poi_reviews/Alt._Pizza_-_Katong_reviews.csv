EMOLUTION SG,3,Counter staff lady was nice but overworked handling too many tasks. Not quite a dine in place its a delivery venue with just 3 tables. Pizza was soggy in the center falling flat down when held up. Just Crust was still crispy n good. Not flavorful cheese n fillings for this hangover pizza. Wings were ok but doesnt look crispy like in the photo. $28 bucks for a super single set seems pricey. Will try others,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100988133411703431405/reviews

Timothy TM,4,"The truffle mushroom pizza is one of the best pizza I’ve had in Sg!! Hawaiian pizza and garlic bread was quite good not the best. Only 3 tables in this store is mainly for takeaway but still nice to sit there for a meal.

RCSC,4,"Nice thin crust pizza. Very little base dough so the toppings stood out. Had the truffle mushroom and chicken bbq ones. Preferred the truffle mushroom as it was very aromatic.

Pasta wise, I love that they use a thinner linguine. Veryy nice shape. Aglio was just ok.

Calamari could be better as it was not very crispy.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101381356185028377091/reviews
JR,4,"The creamy bacon pasta was abit tasteless so not really recommended, ordered the sourdough pizzas, got the beef one (this was just normal and alot of onions, didnt realize it has onions when i ordered this so it was my bad) +  Truffle Shuffle (this was good, not too overpowering, truffle taste abit light but overall taste is ok!)  if you order delivery, you may heat up at airfryer at 160 degrees for 6mins, it’ll be so crunchy and the cheese melts again! Good! Oh the chicken finger quite expensive but normal taste only",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114550840373190192032/reviews
