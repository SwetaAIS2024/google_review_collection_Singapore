Chloe Koh,5,"I highly recommend Therapist Goh TP as a therapist for anyone dealing with pain and discomfort. I’ve been working with him to manage pain from sprains and chronic neck tightness, and he has been an absolute lifesaver. Therapist Goh's approach is both professional and compassionate, taking the time to understand my specific needs and crafting a personalized plan to help alleviate my discomfort.

His expertise and skill in addressing muscle tension and joint pain have made a noticeable difference in my recovery. Not only does he use effective techniques, but he also takes the time to explain what he's doing and why, which helps me feel more confident in the process.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103354307799224894567/reviews
Samantha Tan,3,"Ready medication works well. Operating hours not very accurate, staff will leave exactly on the dot of closing time. But operations will cease for the day 15mins before closing. Do take note on the timing else it's a waste trip down.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115394865342786594549/reviews
Wong CC,5,"Beijing Tongrentang is exceptionally good in tuina therapy. I experience it once for my plantar faciitis (heel pain) which western doctors  just recommended physio that didn’t help after 1 year. Here, after 5 sessions the pain vanished. Second experience was pain in my left palm at base of thumb, hand ortho doctor prescribed a brace for 3 months without moving my thumb and it did nothing - Here, after just 1 tuina session it healed. Dr. Li Bin is the expert in tuina, you should give him a try.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105775061372332519842/reviews
Siyuan Chen,5,tuina here has worked very well for my slipped disc issues. hospital physio has either never worked for me or the therapist simply gives a set of exercises with no real interest in your issues. here they do not push you to take on more treatment than necessary or sign on for packages - just visit when needed.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111214685135308372180/reviews
siau seh qiao,1,"as for tuina, after dr wang left in early this year, the successor dr wang is not as good as his preceder.
as for neike, met dr wang yan for one session, and she did have some brilliant points on my body, but the treatment is nearlly useless.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100760030179261874807/reviews
