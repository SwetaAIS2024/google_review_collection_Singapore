      "text": "I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation for Dr. Joel Lim at Northshore Family Clinic. He recently did the dressing for my son and was extremely gentle, patient, and friendly throughout the process. His calm and reassuring manner helped put my son at ease, which made the experience much more comfortable for both of us.\n\nDr. Lim took the time to explain each step clearly and handled the dressing with great care and professionalism. It’s not easy to find someone who is not only skilled but also genuinely kind and compassionate. We’re very grateful for his excellent service and would highly recommend him to any family looking for a caring doctor.",

However, the only drawback is the front desk staff wearing a hijab, who has been described as rude and lacking compassion by many patients, including myself.\n\nNotably, numerous reviews have echoed similar sentiments, highlighting the staff member's behavior as uncompassionate, especially when patients are already feeling unwell and vulnerable.",

It truly helps families.\nHowever, as there have been many reviews with the front counter staff wearing a hijab, i do agree she is rude, impatient, and defensive. She does not have the quality of being a service staff. I am not here to face your attitude. I will close one eye because my aim ultimately is for the doctors experience. But disgust me is the way this staff is handling her patients. The previous staffs at counter were all very helpful, except for her. She has definitely need to learn more from her colleaugues.",
