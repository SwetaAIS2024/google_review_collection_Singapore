      "text": "Firstly I like to mentioned this school is too greedy of your money. Before you apply any phlebotomist course do make sure you have experience, either you are SN or EN you can proceed with the course. If you have no background in phlebotomist and wanted to change job scope better not. Once you completed the course all the job you apply under phlebotomist they will asked, if you have any experience adleast 1yr if no just forget it. You will waste your money. I did asked the lecture if no experience can get the job, he is just giving you false hope that you can easily apply for the job once you have the certificate. And the school admin nor lecture will wash their hands once you completed your school with them, difficult to get them for the ojt and e cert.",
