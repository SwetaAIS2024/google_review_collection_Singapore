      "text": "A pretty unknown weekend morning only, farmers market. MUST call before going sometimes they bring all the stock to roadshow.\n\nThey sell a variety of vegetables not at the cheapest price as compared to the wet market (pictures included) but we buy with the peace of mind knowing that it is made in Singapore with no harmful pesticides unlike some suppliers that the vegetables look so perfect.\n\nFor people who own a garden, they also sell a variety of seedlings to speed up your harvest.\n\nYou can also spend a few minutes to walk around and admire the vertical farming.\n\nThe lift is the only way to enter the farm, so no point parking all the way up. Just park near the lift.\n\nOtherwise just bring your phone and go for a morning jog.  They accept paynow.",
