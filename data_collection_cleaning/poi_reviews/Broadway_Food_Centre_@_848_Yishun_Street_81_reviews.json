      "text": "I will be going around trying their stalls. However for today , it would be Mei Xin Tong Tau Foo. I really like the offer for the 5 ingredients with noodle/rice would cost no more than 5 dollars. Really quite a steal. For this meal, I had Curry Laksa Noodle (Yellow Mee).\n\nThe price is the main seller of the meal. Next, it would be the option for Laksa Curry and to deep fry your ingredients. Not always a given at your local YTF (Yong Tau Foo) stall. Additionally, the selection is as usual with the tofu with meat etc.\n\nHowever ingredients wise , doesn't seem to meet the other franchises ratings. (I have not tired others. It appears to have decent ratings at other outlets). Ingredients does not seem as fresh, deep fried items are too dry and laksa curry was not as flavourful and slightly watery. It does have some spice kick nevertheless but nothing much for the spicy lovers.\n\nI would give the stall a 2.5 ⭐ but bumped it up to a 3 due to the generous price. You could choose to skip and explore the other alternatives in this coffeeshop.",
