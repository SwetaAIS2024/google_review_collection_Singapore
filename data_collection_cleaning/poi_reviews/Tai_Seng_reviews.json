      "text": "If you’ve ever been to Tai Seng MRT station around 6 PM, you know it’s a nightmare. The place is packed with people, especially Malaysian workers, and it’s chaotic.\n\nGetting on a train feels almost impossible, and if you miss one, good luck—sometimes you have to wait an hour just to catch the next one.\n\nThe crowds are overwhelming. Everyone’s crammed together, and there’s no space to breathe, let alone move comfortably. It’s frustrating how disorganized everything feels.\n\nThere’s no proper queue system, and people are just pushing and shoving to get on the train. It’s stressful and exhausting.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that the trains don’t come often enough to handle the number of people. You’d think they’d plan for such a busy station, but it seems like they haven’t.\n\nMore trains, better schedules, and some crowd control would make a huge difference. Until then, commuting through Tai Seng during peak hours will continue to be a test of patience. It’s honestly a terrible experience.",
