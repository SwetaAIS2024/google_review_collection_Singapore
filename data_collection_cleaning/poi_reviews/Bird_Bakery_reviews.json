      "text": "Bird Bakery is a delightful spot to grab a bite before or after exploring Bird Paradise. They offer a range of fresh breads and savory options, along with fruity beverages. The atmosphere is bright and cheerful, thanks to the large windows that fill the space with natural light. The pastries and cakes are delicious, especially the Signature Swan Cream Puff and Mini Nest Chocolate Savarin. While slightly expensive, it's a worthwhile treat within the park. Service can be slow when crowded. Good coffee and ice cream",

Quiche was alright, nothing fantastic and it was pretty small. The ambience of the shop was comfortable and cooling though, great to rest the legs after a day at the park.",
