S. ME,1,"Poor service ,lack of observation of the staff which treat u as criminal . I walk in with a bag of oranges from Ntuc. And I come out with empty hand as most of the shelves are empty. When I walked a distance she called me from far and asked about the bag of oranges. Do you think is appropriate? And the store also installed with CCTV , what's the use of it ??! Sorry to mean it but it feels offended.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103506784908345970723/reviews
MZ Chua,5,"If I can give more than 5 stars I will definitely give them. The staffs are all so friendly, they remember you and greet you with a big smile when you go back every time. They will let you know if the fruit you are getting is ready to eat already or still need to let it sits for another day or so. If you need anything and cannot find, just ask any one of them and they will help you with it instantly. Great and friendly mart near my house. üíïüëç",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103257170768921671508/reviews
