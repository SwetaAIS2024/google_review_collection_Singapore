Han Lee,4,"Very small and unassuming coffee shop near the oldest HDB in Singapore (which is part of a heritage trail).

The butter Kaya toast is amazing! They were very generous and the drinks are cheap! $1.20 for Kopi / teh. Hard to find such price points in Singapore these days. The eggs are huge and opened for you!

There is a Malay food stall which is v popular too. Will try next time.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116918025714974988/reviews

Azlin Sani,4,"I can only comment on the 1st malay stall (nearest the entrance) after eating here a few time. Food is authentic traditional taste, so good and very affordable. Seats are limited, so most customers buy n pack. Friday is filled with congregation from local mosque at lunchtime. I can eat here everyday!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109668145250434276473/reviews
