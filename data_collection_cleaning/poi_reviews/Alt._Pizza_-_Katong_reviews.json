      "text": "Counter staff lady was nice but overworked handling too many tasks. Not quite a dine in place its a delivery venue with just 3 tables. Pizza was soggy in the center falling flat down when held up. Just Crust was still crispy n good. Not flavorful cheese n fillings for this hangover pizza. Wings were ok but doesnt look crispy like in the photo. $28 bucks for a super single set seems pricey. Will try others",

Only 3 tables in this store is mainly for takeaway but still nice to sit there for a meal. Staff are friendly, food is good value and ur getting quality pizza most importantly.",

Preferred the truffle mushroom as it was very aromatic.\n\nPasta wise, I love that they use a thinner linguine. Veryy nice shape. Aglio was just ok.\n\nCalamari could be better as it was not very crispy.",

Good! Oh the chicken finger quite expensive but normal taste only",
