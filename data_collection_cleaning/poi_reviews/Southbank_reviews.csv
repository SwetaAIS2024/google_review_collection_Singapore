Fer R,1,We almost got scammed by a “rental” unit in this building. It was pretty elaborate scam where the agent sent us this video & arrange a viewing. He/she had a colleague/personal assistant to bring us around the building & view the unit at level 18. Beware!,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113400603617852797126/reviews

Arif Lukman,5,"I've sent food here quite a few times (am food delivery rider). The view from the highest floors is simply amazing. The lift is also pretty damn quick, which, due to my irrational fear of lifts, unnerves me a little. But the ride is quite smooth so there isn't much issue there. The security guards are pretty helpful too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108144158051410009276/reviews
Sixtytwo Wave,1,"Very bad attitude main security guard. Give wrong lift lobby direction but refused to admit and want to quarrel.

I m a delivery driver. I informed the main guard and a part time guard at least 6 times and showed him the delivery address on my app that I need to go to unit #××-12 (one two) and block 881. He kept insisting its the wrong block stated in my app. And informed me to go to the other furthest lift and another block.

So I went but couldn't enter the unit number on the intercom and came back to the guard post again. I even called the customer to clarify. The guard denied his mistake and wanted to show aggressiveness. He said that I mentioned unit zero two (02), not unit One Two (12). How can the words ""zero"" and ""one"" sound the same!!

Time is precious to all customers n he just wasted 15mins of mine n customer's perishable items.

So unprofessional as a security guard to the residence. If don't like that resident, don't bring issues onto delivery people.
