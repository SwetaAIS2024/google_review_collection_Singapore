The options can get quite odd to go with pasta like peanuts, cucumber, corn, and boiled eggs. The serving size can be rather small.\n\nThe place is clean, spacious, and comfortable.\n\nVegetarian option available.",

Lunch can only be served strictly from 11am (not even a second earlier!) with the staff standing around watching the clock on their handphone to strike 11am before they can proceed to take order. A really strange practice.",
