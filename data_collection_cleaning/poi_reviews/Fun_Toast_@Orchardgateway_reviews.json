      "text": "The Fun Meal I had this afternoon was very toothsome! The must-try BBQ Prawn with Rice (SGD8.90) and signature Yuan Yang (SGD2.20) were good-sized and prepared to my tasteüéØüéØ\n\nSucculent prawns with long beans, eggplant, lady's fingers and onion in a tangy tamarind (aka assam) sauce were well-flavored, marinated and cooked. Excellent medley of sour, sweet and savoury  flavors coming together harmoniously. Piquant and nummyüòãüòã Yuan Yang, as always, was fragrant, thick and had the perfect ratio of tea-coffee-milk and sweetnessüëçüí™\n\nFun Toast @Orchardgateway has a variety of food & beverage choices at pocket-friendly prices and a clean, ample space. Direct access to/from Somerset MRT Station and nearby office buildings via the underpass makes it a convenient spot for take-out, casual meal, social meet-up, pit stop to rest tired feet or after-work chillax.",
