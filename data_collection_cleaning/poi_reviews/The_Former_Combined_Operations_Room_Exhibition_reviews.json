Built in 1934 and was first used for the Sikh Contingent of the Straits Settlement Police Officers. Later used for Sikh officers and their families and became a barrack. During WWII, it was disbanded in 1945. After the war it was used by many government ministries including the Ministry of Interior and Defence. It was also last used as the Police Headquarters. There is also a Museum there and it's worth a visit.",
