      "text": "My family and I came here to have a BBQ meal for the first time. The bill came up to more than $200. The boss was not helpful at all and refused to reverse credit card charge after paying bill. I had requested to re-pay with 10% discount after seeing an offer at a small screen at side of payment counter. My company will readily do it and help customers as long as there is no one making a payment after the customer has made the transaction. The boss insisted that the screen indicated that no discount can be claimed after making payment but if you have a certain sense to help customers defray their high cost of dining, why canâ€™t the payment be made void? I have encountered various merchants and business operators who do it almost immediately as long as there is no one making payment after me. Will not come again if the boss is so fixated on making money. Would you? This is a case of penny wise, pound foolish. The boss thought that he was right and justified not to help this customer but in doing so, he will lose  plenty of business from me and my acquaintances for many years to come. Weâ€™ll just go to other eateries that offer the same type of food but with bosses that are genuine and sincere towards customers.",

Later on, we added the 2mm pork belly, which I loved so much of the solid meat texture! The Korean boss cooked all the meats on our table,  nice... There are 6 side dishes, salad, soup, and steam egg included. I simply loved the potato salad! The Cass beer added a final touch to my meal, which I enjoyed so much! Thank you!! â™¡",
