Kah Mun Tong,5,"quiet and cozy bar tucked behind a painting in conrad. drinks were slightly sweet, but incredibly well balanced (kiko yume, hojicha old fashioned, plum passion, in-house rendition of bee's knees). got the happy hour platter to have a taste of the food - was ok, but not as impressive as the drinks. would highly recommend coming here for their cocktails!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102505535620880984184/reviews

Jason Reid,5,"A hidden gem located on the 1st floor of the Conrad Singapore Orchard! The entrance has a secretive vibe, adding to the charm of the experience. The cozy space is intimate yet inviting, and there’s even a secret menu for bites if you know how to ask.

The cocktails we tried were fantastic, each with a unique touch of Japanese influence that felt both innovative and thoughtfully crafted.

Special thanks to Mark for the exceptional service. We’ll be back the next time we’re in Singapore!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108276899749081178705/reviews
Rennie Lee,4,"Had the Tsuki set here. Small quiet place with nice vibes. We especially loved the sashimi dish, the marinade was so good! Other dishes were good too - uni was not the smelly kind. Overall, good experience here~",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104896149882118051128/reviews
Akosua Wee,5,"Came here for dinner, and their service here is really top notch! The 2 guys who attended to us were really nice and polite! They took time to explain the menu and dishes to us 👏🏻 Really love that little touch!

Thankful it wasn’t a very busy Friday as well, so had a quiet dinner, which was nice!

Loved the starters and the maki! Def worth trying the house maki - the mentaiko sauce was AMAZING! And the uni pasta, was a really rich creamy sauce which went so well with the uni!

Really great first time at this place, and enjoyed ourselves!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114324517151298244395/reviews
