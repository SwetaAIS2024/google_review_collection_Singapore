      "text": "This was my third visit to this restaurant. My first two experiences were disappointing‚Äîthe pasta and fried chicken I tried previously were unpleasant, with the chicken being particularly dry.\n\nThis time, we ordered the roast chicken, and it was a game-changer. The chicken thighs and wings were cooked to perfection‚Äîtender, juicy, and impressively large. The fries, however, could use some improvement; they‚Äôre best enjoyed while hot.\n\nThe cheese sticks were decent, though I would have preferred a tangier, more acidic dipping sauce. Unfortunately, the Korean-style wing sticks were a letdown, with a sauce that didn‚Äôt capture authentic Korean flavors. The fish and chips are also worth skipping.\n\nThat said, I‚Äôll definitely return for the roast chicken‚Äîit‚Äôs the highlight of the menu.\n\nPretty full in the evenings especially on the wkends",

Surprisingly the rice I was served was chicken rice, I didn't expect that but the food was delicious nevertheless. I will obviously be coming back after such a wonderful first visitüòÅüëç",

Just like how Mcd's also has a larger portion of fries.",
