      "text": "I recently visited this Yakiniku outlet, and while the experience had some positive aspects, there were also several disappointing elements. The food itself was acceptable, nothing particularly memorable but not terrible either. However, I was disappointed by the very limited variety of choices available at this location. For a Yakiniku place, I expected a wider range of options, both in terms of meats and side dishes.\n\nThe service was another letdown. The restaurant appeared to be understaffed, and those who were working seemed to be in no hurry to attend to customers. There was a noticeable lack of attentiveness, and it felt like the staff were taking their own sweet time, which led to longer waits for service.\n\nOverall, while the food was passable, the limited options and lackluster service make it hard to recommend this particular Yakiniku outlet at Downtown East. If you're looking for a more satisfying dining experience, it might be worth exploring other options nearby.",

Utensils and cups are not cleaned well, grill stove also looks bad with food scraps in it. Family had diarrhoea after eating at the restaurant and wont be going back again. Management seriously need to review hygiene and staffing issues.",

Not impressed!!\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-//-\n\nWent to look for food at downtown east in Pasir Ris & decided to give this outlet a try‚Ä¶\n\nProbably due to shortage of manpower, their servicing staff are mainly students & not so familiar what they offer‚Ä¶\n\nThe marinated pork belly is a bit salty but goes well with the sauces they provided‚Ä¶\n\nOverall, not bad but portion of food quite little‚Ä¶. Just my opinion üòû",

      "text": "New outlet that just recently opened at Downtown East! Service was decent and the sauces were not too bad as well.\n\nThe meats were fresh but the portions were slightly lacking for the price. Overall a clean and good vibe eating here. The grills were very strong and one should take caution not setting them too high, else a slight fire may break out, especially with the fattier cuts of meats!\n\nOne can expect to spend around $50+ if ordering other meats apart from their set meals. They also serve (as an added paid option) unsweetened iced tea which is great!\n\nDo note that their break time is usually between 3.30pm-5pm, hence they will be temporarily closed during those hours.",
