Fang Ying Pang,5,"DR Kang and the staff in this clinic are very warm and pleasant . The clinic environment is clean and welcoming . As we make appointments before coming in , there is usually a very short wait to see the doctor .

Dr Kang is patient and assuring , answering all my questions . His medications work well on me. He is knowledgeable and very approachable .

The clinic also checks in with me a few days after a consultation , just to check how everything is going . ðŸ˜Š",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115243440240086631441/reviews
