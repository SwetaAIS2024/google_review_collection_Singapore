Zhang G,5,"Jes is a very experienced best teacher. And she is friendly, hardworking. My daughter said her maths class is interesting and she doesn't want to sleep. Thanks a lot for Jes teaching S4 Math at very important times. Helping my daughter got A two from B three.

Alex Toh is an excellent Chemistry teacher. He can help grasp the key points and teach everything my daughter doesn't understand. At first she worried about Science failure. In the end she got A One at O Level exam.

Jes and Alex are No.1 tuition teachers among all the tutors I know. Highly recommended.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101754781175349929503/reviews
lachattesg lachattesg,5,"Mr Toh is a truly caring and effective tutor. He not only coached my child from a Fail in lower secondary to Distinction for O levels, he also worked on encouraging her and building up her self confidence. He had so much belief in my daughter's abilities and that spurred her on to work towards that Distinction. That mattered a lot to us.

Thank you, Mr Toh!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114893091812958839873/reviews
