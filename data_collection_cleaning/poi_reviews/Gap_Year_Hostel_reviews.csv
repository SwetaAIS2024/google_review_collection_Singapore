Frank,1,"This review is for Gap Year Hostel's side business as collection point in 2023-2024.

We’ve had consistent difficulties collecting our parcels from Gap Hostel’s collection service. Despite visiting during the recommended times (10AM - 6PM) and checking back frequently (like, every hours), the front door is often locked and unattended, with no contact information provided. This has led to our parcels being returned due to limited storage time. Attempts to kindly address the issue with the owner were met with an unapologetic response citing limited manpower. Given this ongoing issue, we have decided not to choose Gap Hostel as a collection point any longer.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103401617665802474102/reviews
Camille Petit,1,"While I understand parcel collection is not your main business, I would expect that the collection hour mentioned are respected. I walked there with a 7kg parce from ParknParcell and none to manage the parcel, no staff to open the door. I waited 15min and decided to walk to another collection point 1km further, also close ...",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108547958227304422822/reviews
B T,1,"Terribly awful parcel collection point, staff left for the day in the afternoon as early as aroubd 3pm without any handover and left their tenants to front the reception, who are expectedly unable to hand the parcels to customers. All orders were returned in this frustrating experience as a result of the staff's irresponsible attitude. ** Staff informed that collection time was within operating hours of 10am to 6pm, which customers abided to. Updated review to clarify that claim by owner of expectation for 24/7 service is false.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112874320611828288332/reviews
Al,1,"Terrible collection point. Collection time says 10am to 6pm, but no one is around. Waited for more than 30min. Called the phone and no one picked up. When the guy came back after 1 hr, he was unapologetic as well.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117316501742326337127/reviews
Djoeis Shi,4,"Hostel is good. Not too expensive. It is capsule style for for 1 person.

This location is not very far to either Farrer Park MRT or Boon Keng MRT (NEL north east line / purple).

There are some halal and non halal eateries nearby.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111128052716293687431/reviews
