      "text": "I called them to solve my power outage problem. They quoted assessment charge of $80 which I accepted because it was after midnight. However, the charges to replace the circuit breakers were way too exorbitant. S$1800 just to replace 25 breakers and 3 switches, which took just an hour or so. On top of that, the electrician did not test that the problem had also caused a fused connection at the main estate DB until after finishing the job, so fixing all the circuit breakers did not resolve the issue. I had to wait till the next morning to resolve the outage issue with my estate electrician. Definitely a AVOID this company.",

He explained that there will be additional charges to other assessments which is ridiculous and dishonest practice. This was not communicated to me clearly earlier during the call.  I only understand that additional cost means the repair service and part costs.  I will never use their service again.",

But they somehow still can spell out the wrong company's name in full for this company (you can check the reviews).\n\nPlease either check whether youre giving reviews for the correct company, or have your eyesight checked. Its very unfair for the employees and stakeholders of any company to work so hard, only for a negative reviews to be filed when they dont deserve it.",
