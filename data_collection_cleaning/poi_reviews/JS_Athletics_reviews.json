      "text": "My children rejoined JS Athletics after being away in Japan for nearly 5 years. We are in SG for the summer holiday. Many new faces, but Coach Manjit is still there! My oldest son and grade 8 daughter recognized him as if he coached them last week. Feels like they never left JS - my children. Indeed they didn’t; In Japan, they ran with the JS training tips and protocol. For two years, when we were in Spore with JS, we attentively listened to the coaches, including coach Lydia and Jack. Coach Lydia coached my youngest son, Lucas, then 5yo, the runners’ mindset; she imbued confidence and the joy of running. Yesterday, Lucas 10yo blazed the track with smiles, effort and enthusiasm. If you are looking for coaches who teaches the right way to run, JS athletics is the gold standard.",
