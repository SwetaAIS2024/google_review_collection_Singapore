Charis Toh,1,"I couldn’t book my vaccine appointment, but the staff blamed me for not booking before the closing date. I was told to get my last dose around this time, six months after the first dose —how is that my fault? The staff even told me they no longer have the vaccine. Very disappointing",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117434872375299048312/reviews
Angela Thomas,1,"Terrible service- the nurses/counter staff are extremely rude and impatient. The doctor was pretty mediocre, in my opinion. Overall, I will not recommend this clinic at all. There are hundreds of better clinics out there!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117612075025514873833/reviews
Adrian Wee,1,"Do not visit this black shop for your helper 6 monthly check up. I ask my helper to go Keystone Clinic nearby. She stupid saw this black shop thought cheaper based on the look. End up charged 58 dollars
Whereas Keystone Clinic quoted me 45 dollars. Previously I am using DA clinics which is cheaper but it's further away I dun have the time to bring her so I ask her to visit Keystone but end up getting con here. Can't blame her as well cos this clinic in deed look more run down and more down to earth compare to the modern looking Keystone Clinic.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116251833082642505152/reviews
Abdul Azeem Mustakin,1,"Q up for one hour. 1st in Q. Went in to register - CANNOT register. Why?
Told me if I’m covid positive I cannot visit this clinic. Are we STILL in 2019?

The nurses were unprofessional without any compassion. Brushed me off and said bring your covid to other clinics for them to treat u.

WHAT kind of sickness could warrant a visit to this doctor?

It seems to me this clinic is choosy about its patients. According to reviews U cannot come late even if u are desperate.
NEVER visit this doctor is the best advise I could give to anyone. Absolutely horrendous.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117467175887960549734/reviews
Zann Yap,1,My dad had a fall. He was unable to get even some dressings for his abrasions on his knees. Asked to go hosp instead. You or your staff should at least provide some form of dressings or helped cleaned up the wound. Why you open clinic for what?,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106195334770417409431/reviews
