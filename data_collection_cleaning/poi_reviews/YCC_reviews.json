There's like 5 pieces of pegaga leaves and it's yellowish....  I found this very disappointing...\n\nThe nasi goreng gila was served with 2 sticks of satay.... The nasi goreng is quite bland & not served hot....\n\nNasi cumi bakar is fine.. that's the best we have on the tables during our dinner .\n\nOxtail soup is a thumbs down.... We take about a piece and stop cause the meat is almost stale.\n\nOverall , it's not a pleasant experience.. with the price charged, I think the customer deserves better food..\n\nBut, thumbs up to the staff for being so welcoming & attentive!!!",

Service was prompt and staff friendly. As it was a Monday, there was only one other couple there. Great ambience and the weather was kind as it was just after the rain. Food was okay. Squid was nicely grilled. Oxtail was tender. But the \"keropok\" was already \"soft\" and the mee rather sweet. Will come again to give their speciality set meals with clams, prawns, mussels and stingray a try. They also have 13 types of different \"sambals.\" Only managed to try two this time round.",
