So many unnecessary rules and they kept finding reasons to pin point people and scold them. After iftar , the facilitators are not clearing up the place properly, grains of rice are around the prayer area. Prayer mats are apparently for covering up boxes of things and worshippers are not allowed to take them for their spots. What rubbish? Can tell nicely as it’s ramadan period why need to shout and point people during this holy month. During bayaan time they are asking the crowd to keep quiet but another volunteer at the same time is screaming for donations and sales of quranic books. The facilitators need to revise their mannerism and how to conduct crowds in a proper way. Out of all the masjids I’ve went to I’ve seen larger crowds than this but handled properly.",
