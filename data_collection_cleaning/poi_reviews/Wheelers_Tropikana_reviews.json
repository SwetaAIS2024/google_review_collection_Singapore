Only have pasta for mains.\nThe food is delicious but the portion is modest. Excellent customer service by Joe and team. Would love to be back to experience the night vibe with live band. Ample parking. Best to bring some mosquitos patch or repellent along.",

The food is exceptional — every dish was flavorful and beautifully crafted, showing off the culinary expertise of the kitchen.\n\nThe service was just as impressive as before. Raymond was warm, knowledgeable, and ensured that everything went smoothly throughout our meal. The staffs’ attention to detail really stood out, making for an stress-free and enjoyable dining experience.\n\nThe ambience continues to be a major draw. The atmosphere is inviting and stylish, perfect for a relaxing night out. To top it off, the live band created a fantastic vibe, playing just the right mix of tunes without overpowering conversation.\n\nIf you’re looking for a great meal, stellar service, and a fun, lively atmosphere, Wheeler’s Tropikana is definitely worth a visit. I’ll be coming back for sure!",

These positive vibes were also apparent and brought out by the Tropikana crew on the wedding day itself.\nOn top of that, there were raving reviews from the guests:\nTwice cooked pork w sweet chilli tamari\nOndeh ondeh\nSlow cooked beef stew with potato, carrot and spring pea\nRoasted organic chicken with confit garlic and lemon",
