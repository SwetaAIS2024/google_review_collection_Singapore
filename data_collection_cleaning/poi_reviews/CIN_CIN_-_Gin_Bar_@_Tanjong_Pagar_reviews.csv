Florence Leow,5,"🟩CIN CIN - Gin Bar @  Tanjong Pagar
❇️ Oasia Hotel Downtown
100 Peck Seah Street #01-02,
Singapore 079333

🔵 Cin Cin is a stylish 75-seater gin bar located in the heart of Oasia Hotel Downtown on the first level. 🟦 As I stepped inside, I was surrounded by a sophisticated and soothing ambience that is perfect for a relaxing evening.

● I scanned through their drinks' menu quickly, and found that their extensive collection features boutique gins from around the world, craft gin cocktails, and gin-inspired drinks.

🟫 I was informed that Cin Cin is primarily a gin bar, and their operating hours are from 3 pm to 11 pm, Tues to Sat. ➡️ They're closed on Mondays and Sundays. 🟥 They have Happy Hours from opening time till 8PM.

🔶️ I ordered the fresh Orange Juice at SGD6+ a glass.

🟦 Service wise = The bar tender, Marco, is a really nice guy. The moment I stepped in, I was greeted by Marco with a wide smile and he ushered me to my seat and offered to dry my folded umbrella ( as it was raining outside). He had a very genuine disposition and was polite, friendly, cheerful and affable.

🟩 It is staff like Marco that makes a place pleasant and interesting. He is an asset to the Cin Cin Bar Lounge. I hope to be back here again with my hubby some day.

Bernie Chin,5,"Lovely cocktail bar. Been here a couple of times. Love their gin based cocktails. Happy hour at $16 per cocktail, but only 4 different types. G&T going for $10. They serve great bar snacks. Was told the snacks come from Marmalade Pantry. One of the better truffles fries I had. Buffalo wings was great too. Cozy ambience and excellent service.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109214621085246958273/reviews
Eugene Wang,4,"Nice fancy hotel bar at a hotel. Came here for some cocktails (Tai tai Tini and Clover club) which were very creative and delicious. Drinks are on the pricer side, paid $57.55 for 2 cocktails including GST. Atmosphere is nice, would recommend coming here at least once.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114747557607427381629/reviews
Anirudh Ayyala,5,"Went for the cin cin free flow gin 2nd time. I must say they are the nicest folks at any free flow alcohol offering avenue. To add, you get access to gins from over 50 choices. Honestly most value for money free flow in SG.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114278238326097466968/reviews

Have visited Cin Cin quite a few times over the years and their creativity with gin cocktails is worth praising every time. During my most recent visit, we ended up trying quite a few drinks. My favourites were the Kopi Kaki, Bloody Berry, Golden Fox Negroni and the Foxy Badger. The Kopi Kaki drink is a must try in my view.

Service is quite good here.

Cin Cin is definitely one of the best gin cocktail bars in SG, and if gin cocktails are your thing, this place is a must visit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117541567004086369769/reviews
