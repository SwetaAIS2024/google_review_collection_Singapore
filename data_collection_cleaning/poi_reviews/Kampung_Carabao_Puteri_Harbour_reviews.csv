wj l,1,"If I can use one word to describe the food here, it is “soggy” and “flavourful”. All of the dishes were consistently soggy and overcooked. The flavours have been amped up to be as salty and sweet as one would have imagined. It is unbelievable how the restaurant could have garnered an average of 4.5stars here. However the consolation being the price is reasonable, would rather they optimize for quality and price it higher…",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112771299025909158494/reviews

Irene D,4,"Our team had lunch at Kampung Carabao , which overlooks the yacht harbour and is located in the quiet surroundings of Forest City. The peaceful environment made for a relaxing dining experience. Aesthetically, the restaurant is pleasing, with a traditional Thai vibe.

As for the food, the Tom Yum soup was excellent, as were the pineapple fried rice, pandan chicken, and prawn omelette. However, the Pad Thai was too soggy, and the crispy kangkong was overly oily and lacked flavor.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105755199362573534660/reviews
Miss Tulip,4,"Staff is friendly,
Only the food is a bit different taste from other Carabao at Stulang.
Price is reasonable .
Only the food quality and taste a bit  disappointed
I ordered Mango Sticky Rice but seems sticky rice was overcooked.
But depends on your preference.
It’s only my opinion.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109643493382969099539/reviews
