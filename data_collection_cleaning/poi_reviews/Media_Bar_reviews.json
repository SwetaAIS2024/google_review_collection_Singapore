Said it was ok. The fries didn't taste very fresh.\nI ordered Cobb salad. Good size. However not much on quantity of items in the salad. First time I had a Cobb with a half cooked hard boiled egg...I liked the oozing of the yolk into the salad.\nWe ordered brownie with peanut butter ice cream and was really good and the size is quite large. It's take me almost 3 days having small portions each time\nI'd go again and try something else.",

      "text": "I actually went there yesterday for a friend's celebration. It is located within the same compound of the new JW Marriott but is apparently owned by a different management.\n\nAmbiance was decent, music and drinks were so-so.\n\nWhat was deplorable was the service attitude and the bill charging. We practically booked out the whole restaurant (not that they had alot of customers in the 1st place). The bar manager was rude, had poor service attitude and was unprofessional. He also tried to push for increase spend when we clearly highlighted our budget.\n\nThey did not tell us and our guests that water was chargeable - which led to over S$250 on water alone!!! They do not offer any discounts on menu prices despite a large customer spend and when we examined the bill there was also a level of double counting (some guests paid for their own drinks).\n\nFor a new watering hole, I expected more in terms of service. Will NOT go back there again.",
