ET Home,5,"I’m a soup lover and found this stall with generous delicious soup. I have tried a few of them on the menu and will try the rest. The soup is piping hot and with fresh tender pork ribs. The flavorful soup definitely will warm your empty stomach and satisfying feel.

It is also children friendly as I bought it home for some kids and they love it.

What is best if you dine in, you can still top up the soup but of course please don’t take advantage of it and show graciousness towards this benefit.

They have golden gourd and white rice to go along with the soup. Their ingredients are fresh and boiled till it’s so tender for kids and senior.

The fullness of the soup is there, the peanuts in the soup are well cooked, ginkgo are soft, red dates are sweet, pork ribs are tender and many others ingredients are tasty too. White Chicken meat soup are a bit too chewy but the black chicken is good.

It is good to go along as a side dish as a meal for family.

Residents who live around here should truly agree with this reviews as I always see queues going on and on.

The staffs are friendly and nice with their attitude towards patrons.

Pak Soon Lau,4,Pretty decent set of traditional pig stomach soup with steamed white rice at $6.60. The portion is quite generous but second refill of soup is apparently not allowed. Good selection of other soups available. You may opt for pumpkin rice too.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107524637554500568527/reviews
