Thusitha Kariyawasam,4,"Visited Saizeriya at Eastpoint Mall, and it was a wonderful experience!

The menu had a great variety of choices that were perfect for little ones â€“ from creamy pastas to cheesy pizzas, they were all smiles.

The staff were warm and attentive, making sure we were comfortable throughout. Food came quickly, and the prices are super family friendly too. Good dining spot that works great for a casual family meal. Weâ€™ll definitely be back",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111031053351929053721/reviews
Angel Cheong,4,"Itâ€™s a good experience eating here. The staff are always very friendly to serve you even though they are so busy with everyone. The shop is fully packed and queue is super long. I love all the food we ordered. I super love the garlic focaccia sourdough bread while it was served warmed. Itâ€™s really delicious! Itâ€™s a cheaper version as there is no gst or service charge. The portions maybe small but one can order 2 different dishes if it does not make u full, or u can eat with rice or focaccia bread! Yums! ðŸ˜‹",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106414060291768557647/reviews
E,4,"Best value for money western food if you're not a fussy eater. The pork ribs cost only $10, where to find? And the taste is pretty decent too. The chicken salad is less than $5 and comes in a big bowl. It's quite filling as the chicken portion is pretty big. The salmon salad is a bit less abundant but still ok.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103665268796109855493/reviews
mo ses,1,"At saizeriya simei , they turn on the lights at 1106am and at 1109am they still don't let us in to just sit down at least. Even when you are not able to open the restaurant at 11am which is stated at the restaurant, minimally you could let us sit inside. As I type this now it's 1110am and the restaurant is still not opened for operation",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108343221540060742783/reviews
Julian Co Yi Feng (Shss),3,"Ugh. It was so good. The food and service were excellent, and the staff were friendly . The thing that bumped everything down was the ventilation. We were at the first few tables and it felt very hot. Dissapointed.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117471222596701926675/reviews
