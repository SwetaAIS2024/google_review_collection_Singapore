Lim Kee Hwee,4,"Today I had this curry rice for dinner and I want to give my honest review. I don't think the previous reviews I have read here about this stall are fairly written. They deserve a better rating. It's a hawker stall and the price and portions are fairly priced, everything are more expensive these days due to inflation. I am also happy with the food server's attitude and was given a free bowl of soup with vegetables as well. Personally I will visit and eat from this stall again in the future.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101519551705258394945/reviews
J,1,"Dishonest and over charge. Ordered ala carte, pork and chicken cutlet, with 3 vegetables. 4 plain rice. Price? $50 note with no change.

Upon return to clarify price, they then said it's $42 and returned $8.

$10 for chicken, $10 for pork, but did not elaborate on how they calculated the balance 3 vegetables and 4 plain rice for $22 despite repeatedly asking them for it. They kept insisting price is right without giving the breakdown and said ""it's like this, there's a queue behind, don't waste their time.""

Eat at your own wallet's peril.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115402134391482929768/reviews
LQ SEE,1,"There’s plastic in the curry rice. Totally unacceptable. When I showed to them, they said ohhh ohh, not even apologising, while I’m awkwardly standing there, only then they offer to change a new one… but that’s not really the point… please improve food handling quality….

Tbh, first impression was not the best as the thickness of the cutlet is freaking thin, thinner than the batter… was eating more flour than meat…",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114023141773308022892/reviews
Bloody Toad,4,"Nice curry rice!  They are likely from Vietnam. Curry taste a bit different from what SG locally taste, but still taste great!  Prices are stated at the signboard and quite logically priced.

Those who like curry rice may want to give it a try.

Something new to the addition to the stall.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113593135148233291633/reviews
Ruennshen Lew (Alex),1,"AVOID AT ALL COST!

The curry is disappointingly bland and watery, while the staff is very rude!
The set meals are pathetic, they only cut 3-4 pieces of cutlet with scissors and discarding the rest back onto the tray for the next customer.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108227996790110567558/reviews
