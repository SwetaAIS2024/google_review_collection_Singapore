      "text": "My family member was feeling very unwell and the nurses and doctors on duty attended to her promptly upon arrival at A&E. Her face was red and lips appeared swollen. This incident took place on 16 March, Sunday, around 1.05am.\n\nThe doctors wasted no time to give her an injection as well as drip. A blood sample was also taken. The treatment was spot on and she felt a lot better after 30 minutes.\n\nShe was given a few hours to rest and recuperate in a quiet and conducive environment before she was discharged from the hospital.\n\nSo I would like to thank and commend the team on duty that night. I was told that they are all Singaporeans. Keep up the good work! üëçüòä",

      "text": "Efficient Visit with some Caring Staff\n\nOverall:  My visit to NUH's Emergency Zone F on a Saturday was efficient and positive. Registration, assessment, and waiting time took a maximum of 30-45 minutes, which felt lucky compared to what I've heard.\n\nHighlights:\n- Fast Service: The overall process was quick, especially considering it was a weekend.\n-A big shout-out to Nurse Jenifer Bedania for her exceptional kindness, attentiveness, and care. She truly made a positive difference in my experience.\n\nAreas for Improvement:\nDoctor 1: While the first doctor was pleasant and offered suggestions, his lack of immediate familiarity with my condition felt concerning. (He searched it online in front of me)\nDoctor 2: Dr. Balakrishnan, while efficient, had a rather blunt bedside manner. This might not be ideal for everyone.\n\nOther Nurses: Some of the other nurses, particularly a young Indian nurse, seemed inexperienced, complaining about how to open a pack of meds finding it \"very annoying\" (like whut?)\n\nDespite these, my experience at NUH Emergency Zone F was positive. The quick service and Nurse Jenifer's care were much appreciated.",
