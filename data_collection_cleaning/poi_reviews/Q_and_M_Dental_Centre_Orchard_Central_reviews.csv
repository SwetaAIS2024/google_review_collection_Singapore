Michelle Chinatsu Khoo,1,"We were really hopeful and excited to try this dental service, especially since it’s a reputable chain. Unfortunately, the experience fell far short of expectations. From the start, the appointment felt rushed, with very little time spent on understanding our concerns. The doctor began treating a decayed tooth right away, without first carrying out a full general examination of the teeth which this should be the most basic to begin with before suggesting X-tray which will cost more than its necessity.

When I asked whether a complete check-up had been done, I was told it wasn’t possible because not enough time had been booked. Apparently, the clinic only allocates 30 minutes per patient, which hardly allows enough time to properly address concerns or perform a thorough evaluation. The doctor suggested we return in two hours, but with our packed schedule, it was unrealistic to spend that much time waiting.

The entire experience felt more like a fast-paced process than the thoughtful, patient-focused care one would expect from such an established name.
It was a disappointing experience that didn’t reflect the level of care or professionalism we had expected.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107652050186657467962/reviews
YCC,5,"Been following Dr Emma since her previous clinic, and I am so happy that her new practice also have the guided biofilm therapy machine too, as the usually scaling polishing is very painful for me, is that kind of nerve pain, but when I opt for this it’s very gentle!

Highly recommend those with dental phobia go try this instead of the usual one.

Dr Emma is very patient with kids too! Happy treatment for me :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103010696067371579091/reviews

Yeo,1,"Our appointment was at 5pm. We came in advance of our appointment timing. It is now 6pm and it is still not our turn yet. Seems like the clinic overbooked patients to maximise profits without respect to patients' time! This is the longest waiting time we had to wait for a private clinic. This impacted our schedules for our subsequent other matters, causing us much inconvenience. When we voiced our concerns about the long waiting time, all 4 staff simply looked at us. What terrible service you have Q&M!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111773492993097382488/reviews
janecia,1,"i had a bad experience during my recent visit to this outlet for scaling and polishing. after a brief consultation, Dr Denise had advised for a filling and fluoride treatment. all these, including scaling and polishing, were done in 15-20 mins. the scaling and polishing was done roughly, with water splashing all over my face and my gums had bleeding slightly. the fluoride was only applied on one tooth and i was charged $40. all in, they charged me $313 for shoddy work. extremely disappointed and will not visit again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116524205010199788802/reviews
