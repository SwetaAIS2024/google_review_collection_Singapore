      "text": "If you like your chicken chop on the drier side like me, then this stall maybe what you are looking for. The chicken chop is old school Hainanese style, lightly covered in flour but still very crispy. The sweet and sour sauce with onions and pineapples is simply the perfect match. Not too sweet or bland. For this amount of serving at $5.50 today (Dec'22), I think it's quite reasonable compared to most other western food stalls. Please do be patient because the stall is operated only by one person.",

Lucky me ! Closed on Monday.\nThe cleanest oil ! Unlike ...........let's not mention names !",
