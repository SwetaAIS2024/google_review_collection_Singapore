Chelsea Kang,2,"My grandma loves the nurses, but we checked her in and paid the insane private fees (she doesn't qualify for subsidy) because she liked the Level 1 unit. Not even half a year later, they move her to a Level 5 room without informing us first. Zero alternatives given, zero communication. Administration pushes everything to the nursing managers who inadvertently leave things out cos of how busy they are. Very poor protocols and SOP, rooms are really bare bones and it's not worth it if the fees are not subsidized.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112972978156035578343/reviews

Chris Lee,5,My mom is housed here for many years. It provides round the clock monitoring of patients. The coat has been stable for many years. That allowed us to plan ahead for decades of care. The nurses communicate any issue to the family regularly.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116440299972982099255/reviews
A N,1,"I used to think that this is one of the better nursing home in Singapore, but there are definitely better ones. As time passes, one will see thru the place and people, sadly without heart and soul...... The only thing worth mentioning is probably the basic nursing care.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110984474211633907389/reviews
