Yellow Bear,4,"Free admission. Beautiful place dedicated to Sri Krishna. Even though Iâ€™m a nonbeliever, I feel welcomed as the priests and devotees greeted me with warm smiles. I believe they are all kind and gentle people as followers of Sri Krishna are loving vegans/ vegetarians.

The architecture of the building and statues are simply beautiful; amazing art pieces to me. Even the pillars are beautiful.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
