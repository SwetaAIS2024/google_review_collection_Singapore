      "text": "Island Kitchen Penang is easily one of my all-time favouritesâ€”their food has never let us down. I just tried their Braised Pork Belly with Salted Fish, and wow, it was absolutely superb! It might just be my new top pick. Though to be fair, Iâ€™ve had a few favourites here before tooâ€”like their Fried Pork with Belacan, Penang Char Kway Teow, and the rich, Asam Curry Fish Head. Every dish is a hit!",

      "text": "This is one of our regular favourite spots!\n\nThe char kway teow (#201) is super nice, full of flavours with great char taste. We gotta order 2nd plate ðŸ˜†\n\n3 sour juice (#602) is a MUST TRY to those who love SOUR (sugar syrup is optional).\n\nThe desserts are tasty! I love both their Chendol and Aloe Vera (#502) served with shaved ice. A go-to for a hot sunny day in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬\n\nForgot to mention, their service is super efficient, though thereâ€™s NO SERVICE CHARGE to be paidðŸ˜Š",

      "text": "Island Penang Kitchen serves up an impressive selection of authentic Penang dishes in a simple, casual environment. With orders coming quick out of the kitchen, the Penang Char Kway Teow stands out with its smoky wok hei and a perfectly balanced mix of prawns, Chinese sausage, and pork lard.\n\nThe Fish Curry is another highlight, rich and flavorful, making it a must-try for curry lovers. The menu features single-sized portions, ideal for sampling multiple dishes in one visit. For dessert, the Chendol is a dependable option, delivering a refreshing sweetness to round off the meal.\n\nThe setting is no-frills, but it complements the focus on great food at wallet-friendly prices. As a fast-casual spot, it doesnâ€™t take reservations, so be prepared for potentially long waits during peak hours. Despite this, service is efficient, and the turnover ensures a steady flow of seating.\n\nIsland Penang Kitchen is a great place to enjoy authentic Penang flavors without breaking the bank, perfect for casual outings and food enthusiasts alike.",

Island Penang Kitchen, located in the heart of West Coast, is a go-to spot for those craving authentic Malaysian cuisine. Specializing in Penang-style dishes, the restaurant offers a menu packed with rich flavors, from fragrant Char Kway Teow to comforting Assam Laksa. The ambiance is casual and unpretentious, with a homely feel that makes it perfect for a relaxed meal. Service is friendly and efficient, ensuring a pleasant dining experience.
