There was a small wait and just simple seating but for the price and authenticity of the slow cooked meat, this is a must visit in Singapore.",

The consomm√© is super unique tasting.\n\nFew months later, they released their Sambal Belachan Fish Tacos & it‚Äôs really the best thing on their menu right now, for me, personally (although I wish it was spicier hehe).\n\nSo glad they‚Äôre finally settling down into curbside crafters soon and hopefully there‚Äôll be more on their menu (more spicy items please) üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ",

      "text": "Absolutely phenomenal! I recently discovered this hidden gem of a birria taco spot, and I can‚Äôt stop raving about it. From the moment I walked in, the warm, inviting atmosphere made me feel right at home.\n\nThe birria tacos are truly a work of art! The meat is incredibly tender and flavorful, bursting with rich spices that transport you straight to Mexico. Each taco is generously filled and comes with a side of luscious consom√© that is perfect for dipping. I also appreciated the fresh, handmade tortillas‚Äîso soft and authentic!\n\nWhat sets this place apart is their commitment to using fresh, local ingredients. You can really taste the quality in every bite. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, eager to recommend their favorites and ensure you have a delightful experience.\n\nIf you‚Äôre in the mood for some mouthwatering birria tacos, do yourself a favor and visit this amazing spot. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back for more! Highly recommend!",
