Marcus,1,"Bought a corner ceiling fan from this store. They assigned me the worst installer in my life i ever encounter.

Charge me $60 for installation and installer charge me $80 for wiring and trunking.

This is the trunking standard of $80.

End up i tear down everything and redo again.

Fan cost me $198 but installation end up cost more than the fan. Really what a joke !",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105842765467526187603/reviews
C S,5,"Shop is located in the West Coast HDB heartland, next to a hawker center and near a shopping mall.  Both owners are nice people and attentive to their customers. I was looking for ceiling fans and the owner explained and demonstrated several types of fan available in the shop in terms of wind coverage & strength, the light temperature, the wind noise, room type, the remote control and pros/cons.  I have learned something new while chatting with the owner.  Thanks for the sharing of knowledge.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115958393276448524911/reviews

Jenny Sufen F,5,Had a pleasant experience with Sarah who was knowledgeable about the products and recommended me appliances that suited my needs. Also very flexible with the delivery timings that I requested. Delivery staff were also very efficient in installation of fans which I had requested and also knowledgeable about their products. Highly recommended!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105561203422833070441/reviews
