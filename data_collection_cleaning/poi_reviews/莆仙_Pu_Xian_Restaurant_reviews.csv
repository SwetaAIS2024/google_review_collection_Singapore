Lance Tan,5,"Excellent food with great service. We have been a patron here for almost 2-3 years now and have been returning customers. You might think that this restaurant is just a knockoff PuTian, but the quality of food and service here is pretty up there.

The lady manager of the place is always so hospitable and friendly to all the customers, introducing new dishes as well as recommendations.

So far whichever dishes that we have ordered are all tasty and of reasonable portion size. Definitely try their signature beehoon.

I recommend coming with bigger groups to try more of their dishes. Excellent place for gatherings with family and friends.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103171518127946119222/reviews
Ed Chung,4,"Located on the 2nd floor of the mall, this Chinese restaurant offers quite an extensive spread of Putian themed dishes and diners could order ala carte from the menu, set meals or buffet. It was noon time, and we came by here for our lunch as we were nearby running errands.

The restaurant was almost full house when we arrived and we were ushered to the table near the main entrance since all the other tables were occupied. After a good 15min wait, we requested to change to anther table inside as diners were leaving.

Ambience was cosy and relaxing with nice decor, we decided to go for the buffet. It was $39.90++ per pax, with a duration of 90mins (time started ticking when the first dish was served). There were 3 dishes that could only be ordered once, but all others can be ordered repeatedly, the main dishes and dimsum items.

And wow, must say the food were actually quite good and yummy. As we have never heard of this restaurant before but the ""other one"" that's more well-known with a few outlets island, we were surprised of it's spread and quality. Most of the food were nicely prepped and cooked. We liked the fried rice vermicelli, deep fried/sweet and sour fish, lychee with pork, braised abalone, the soup of the day, deep fried yam with sugar, braised chicken feet etc, just to name a few. But we couldn't order all the dishes.

And they also had a good spread of desserts, including the durian ice cream, yam paste with ginko nuts and black glutinous rice with coconut cream. They were really delicious and good, presentation was exquisite! Chinese tea, softdrinks and coffee etc were included in the spread as well.

We ordered quite a number of dishes and enjoyed the food! Staff were friendly, helpful and efficient too in serving and clearing the used plates and serving food frequency quite fast and so you do not waste time waiting. And trust me, 90mins is sufficient for you to taste the lovely dishes. Of course, if they can extend the time to 2hrs or unlimited timing, that would be perfect, since we always love to chit chat and eat leisurely and slowly instead of having to take note of the ""timing"".

And you can use your CDC vouchers here too which we used to offset part of the bill.

Overall, the food was really nice and we will revisit again!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105056380002360483849/reviews
