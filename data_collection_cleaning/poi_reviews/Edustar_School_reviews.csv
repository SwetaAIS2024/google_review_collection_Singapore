Celeste Thng 湯皖棋,5,My eldest daughter has been going to Edustar since she was P4 as her English compo was almost failing. She loves the compo class at Edustar and her compo improved a lot as well. The teachers and the owner of Edustar are very kind and are always willing to lend a helping hand when needed. This year my girl added customized math class 1 term before PSLE to give it a boost. Highly recommended tuition center who cares more for the students than profit margins.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113989811080814887519/reviews
