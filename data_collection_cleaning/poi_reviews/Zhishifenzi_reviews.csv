yong chuang koh,5,"The service and food surpassed my expectations. Their Mookata provided a great variety of food and an excellent customer experience . I ordered food items and a chicken soup. The aroma of the soup and food is appetising. The seafood and meat are fresh. I would strongly recommend everyone try their marinated meat and seafood because they are tender and delicious.
