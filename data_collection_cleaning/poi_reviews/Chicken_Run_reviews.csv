Joel Tan,5,One of the best chicken pots I had. Quality of chicken is good; tender and moist. Comes in a mini claypot with a fire below. You can ask to add more gravy and add side dishes. Fantastic lunch deals at $10.90. Will be back.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106082472909570506113/reviews
T Y,3,"I always see the place crowed, so I decided to give it a try. We decided to order the medium chicken pot with level one spicy which cost $21.90 for 2-3 person sharing. Customizable options with three levels of spiciness. The thick brown broth goes perfectly well with rice. They will top up the soup, which turns the pot into a steamboat. Additional-on is available for the steamboat. The prices range from $1.90 to $3.90. Besides that, we ordered egg fried rice with honey chicken chop. The taste is average. Maybe next time we can consider their lunchtime promotion.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112126987571849762797/reviews
Wei Jing,5,Tried this place for the first time and was satisfied with the quality of the food. The chicken hotpot was nice as it wasn’t salty and the chicken cubes were tender too. The ngoh hiang was average but crispy. Love the French beans with garlic & shrimps too. Attentive and friendly staffs too. Would recommend.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114423662560713270527/reviews

Chicken pot(M) 鸡肉香锅
Stir fried Baby Spinach 蒜炒箥菜
Pork belly with Crushed Garlic 蒜泥白肉

🍜 Food wise:
It should be very good to start eating the Hot and sour fish pot, the soup was so refreshing and was very appetizing. The fish was pretty firm and delicious, and dip it with their chilli sauce for an additional spicy kick! Good for sharing between 3 or more people!

Next, the chicken pot was saucy, the bubbling of the gravy by itself looked very appetizing already. Taste wise was not bad, the meat was pretty tender and nice chewy texture. Other ingredients were fresh, crunchy and sweet. In my opinion, the meat size was slightly small, if only the meat was a bit thicker, and throwing in a bit more dried chilli then I think would be perfect. It still tasted quite nice in general! Good for sharing between 2 or 3 persons given the portion of meats, the chunks of fish from the fish pot was more satisfying and sufficient.

Stir fried baby spinach was fragrant, fresh and savoury. Quite good, veg lovers might appreciate it more!

The pork belly was nice, coated with aromatic minced garlic sauce along with fresh crunchy cucumbers. Overall taste wise still has room for improvement though.

✨ Ambience wise: Felt slightly like Song Fa Bak Kut Teh or Dian Xiao Er restaurant, Chinese restaurant vibe!

🤵🏻 Service wise: Great!

y x,5,Love this chicken hotpot. Can choose to cook the side dishes yourself or cooked for you by the kitchen. Dine in a few times and top choice for claypot chicken. Cooking time is slightly longer hence won’t recommend to eat if you are in a rush. Else good place and affordable!,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117375655905020266482/reviews
