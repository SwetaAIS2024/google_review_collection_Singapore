The KTV system is up-to-date with the latest songs and has an excellent sound system, so you can really enjoy your karaoke sessions. While you might have to wait a little if itâ€™s full house, the pool table is just $2 per game.\n\nThereâ€™s plenty of parking right outside the pub.\nHighly recommend! :)",
