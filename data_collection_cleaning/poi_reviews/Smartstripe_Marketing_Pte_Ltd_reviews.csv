Veronika Wongsarot,5,"I‚Äôve had a great experience working with the Smartstripe team particularly Margaret. From the start, she was highly professional, responsive, and attentive to every detail. The quality of their cards exceeded expectations ‚Äî sharp printing, excellent material, and aligned with sustainable practices too. It‚Äôs clear they care about both their craft and their clients. Highly recommend!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109765300295187201574/reviews
TJM,1,"Rude, unprofessional and entitled staff. Will never recommend

Re: Yes due to pdpa.
Interaction was with a staff from your sales team mainly made via calls, emails will indicate otherwise - very strategic. So, there were no paper or email trials for your investigation. Perhaps this is why it has been unnoticed by your management.
Appreciate your team reaching out, however, we cannot condone such practices with our vendors.
Hopefully improvements will be made.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110718944476026156589/reviews
