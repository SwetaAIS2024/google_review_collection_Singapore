Wilson Chew,2,"This is one of the worst McDonald out there, I think if not because of its premier location, it would have gone out of business long time ago. The staffs there are always rude (to be fair, I think this is the boss’s fault as the shop is very understaffed and everyone looks stressed out). Whenever there are good stuff like a good toy for happy meal, they are always out of stock, and even the auto machines run out of receipt.

Recently they hired an older gentleman name Seah, the manager obviously is not happy with him but honestly I think he is best staff there, at least he is very friendly to customers, which is more than what I can say for everyone else there.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101041109320259020672/reviews
Fazz Mohamad,1,"1 simple meal with 2 honey mustard sauce was too difficult for u to fulfill it accurately.
Triple cheese burger meal upsize with medium sprite and large fries add on were 2 packets of honey mustard sauce. Yet when I reach home no honey mustard sauce. Simple yet complicated to fulfill my orders",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103615593762806009967/reviews
saini ekwan,2,"Noticed a decor on a glass panel beside the self-order booth. To me, it looks like an animated outline image of a pig’s head, as it is pink in colour with a drawing of its pointed ears + what looks like a snout. (see photo attached). I asked the outlet shift manager, he claimed it’s an image of a cow. When I asked him why a cow is pink in colour, he gave me a sheepish smile. When I asked him if the image looks like a cow or more like a pig, he smiled again without giving me an answer.
It may be a trivial issue I’m bringing up here, but I feel a change in the colour of the ‘cow’ from pink to brown or black would avoid any unnecessary misrepresentation of the image since McDonald’s is a halal-certified eatery.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106431709706484998303/reviews
Carol Chang,1,"The packaging is damaged, the drink spilled all over. Half the cup is gone. There is absolutely no honey provided! Very bad experience, destroy your days!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113539004434828535441/reviews
Blackraven,5,"Tip: Enjoy the fries first, because they are good for the first 5-10 minutes only!
(Jun2023) Very popular delivery services from this outlet, with a busy mobile order collection counter. Small outlet quite cosy and efficient service!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114385515451710838076/reviews
