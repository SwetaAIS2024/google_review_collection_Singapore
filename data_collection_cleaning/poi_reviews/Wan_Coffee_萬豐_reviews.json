      "text": "Passed by this place multiple times, but never gave it a chance until just recently. Ordered their rendang chicken rice & nasi lemak with chicken fillet. To my delight, both were well-presented, flavorful, and good portion. Their signature coffee is quite intense, but I got no complaints about that. This restaurant covers 2 shop lots which provide ample space for diners. Waiters were polite, and food were quick to be served. My only negative comment is the amount of flies there. I'd say this is an underrated restaurant; would come again.",
