The rice alone cost $1.50 for a normal rice, which I can buy 3 bowls next stall at 50cent each.\n\nOverall experience: Disappointed\n\nFor next Customer who ordering, please remember to ask him for the price first before you place an order. They do not key in cashier when they collect payment. Very dishonest. Shouting at other customers and being rude, another customer walked away after my order.",
