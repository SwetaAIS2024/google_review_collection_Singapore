Lu-anne Yan,5,"A cosy space with lots of friendly regulars. Special shout out to bartender William - a young and talented mixologist. As this place isnt primarily a cocktail bar, there were not a lot of ingredients available for him to be able to fully work on customised drink requests but he was quick on his feet, listened to my preference and created a couple of really delicious cocktails based on that. A perfect hangout spot to unwind after work in the east side. I'll be back!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116005433635204642968/reviews

Clare L,5,"It saved us from the raining day.! Lovely place with lovely service.
Fried Ebi were good with the combination of the wasabi Mayo sauce. Mozzarella cheese sticks were legit which you could see on my picture. The waitress made sure your popcorn cup was full. ! Free flow popcorn!!
Definitely recommend this place for your after work drinks or somewhere you would like to chill.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108916871259693497832/reviews

J Stasia,5,"Amazing service, amazing food, amazing cocktails, amazing ambience. In a very intimate setting, you're immediately treated with great hospitality. I love that you can speak to the bartender and get yourself a bespoke cocktail exactly to your liking. The food items I've tried so far are really good too but could be a tad on the pricier side. I love the impossible slider and pizza! I actually prefer them to the meat options. The prawns were delish too! Definitely coming back often!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112390676495421943232/reviews
