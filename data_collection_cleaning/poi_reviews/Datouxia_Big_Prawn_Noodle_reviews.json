The prawn noodle did not disappoint, the soup is not the over rich type but tastes homely and soothing. The price of $9 for a big bowl also comes with 8 decent sized prawns, full prawns that have been de-shelled, not those cut into halves with the shells intact type. Very nice and very good value for the cost!",
