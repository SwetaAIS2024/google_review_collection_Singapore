Raymond Seah,4,Been wanting to try the lamb stew here. Finally get to try the dish today. Its like lamb bak kut teh with herbs. The lamb is surprisingly tender and the broth is tasty. I will ask for more vegetable or beancurd skin the next time. My friend decided to  order beef bak kut teh after seeing my lamb stew order. Here's the beef BKT.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113361663713818392653/reviews

Today is SUPER HARD for me to set a review... Really super hard... To the people who knows me... KNOWS HOW MUCH I LOVE FOOD.. I have made up my stomach to let EVERYONE knows... üò©üò©üò©üò©

THIS IS THE BEST TOM YUM I EVER HAD.. NO WHERE ELSE BUT IN A FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD IN MCPHERSON

Yes you heard me out loud.. The reason why i said it was hard for me cuz EVERY SINGLE TIME I HAD TO MAKE THIS REVIEW... Tom Yum bowl is empty... JIN MANE ENTAH DA KAUP GUA NYE TOM YUM LA  üëøüò¨ü§ê.. Sampai je trus tom yum hilang.. So JUST FOR TODAY! I tried locking my saka la dey.. Instead of buying SINGULAR bowl.. I just bought THE MEGA TOM YUM CHICKEN ""4pax""  **WORTH IT""*  took 2 boomerang snaps and choose this one instead edited a lil while eating this SUPER DELICIOUS SOUP.. You can definitely taste THAILAND in every slurrrrpppp la sehhhh..  Bought a couple of times and im more to a CHICKEN FAN than SEAFOOD.. They have both.. and i always ask for EXTRA spicy..  and it NEVER FAILS ME.. Legit NEVER EVEEEERRR FAIL ME...

If ya'll don't believe me.. Go and try for yourself... I am picky with my food for me to be super in love it.. PEOPLE WHO KNOWS ME.. THEY CAN TELL YA when i love it.. I SERIOUSLY WILL LOVE IT...

So MEGA TOM YUM CHICKEN which i opt for EXTRA SPICY.. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Nur Shahfiqah Akbar,5,My hubby loves the bak kut teh. Not too strong and not too light for a 1st timer! Superb chocolate banana fritters. Came for the 2nd time for their Tom yum noodle and I love it too. Nothing to critic. Just over the moon. Would love to come again real soon!,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115446120308477336802/reviews
Alethea Tan,5,Visited halal delicacies to try their halal bak kut teh (beef) and it was extremely delicious! The aunties and uncles working there were also very friendly. Definitely recommend visiting this place,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105210942627727176212/reviews
hazel frank,2,The stall is NOT OPEN on weekends. And on weekdays they are not open as indicated on google. Came twice on weekdays after 1pm and still not open. Should update timings and not make customers confuse!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110227035012285837122/reviews
