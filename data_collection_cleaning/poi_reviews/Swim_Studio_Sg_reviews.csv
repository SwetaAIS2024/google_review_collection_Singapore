Starz Star,5,"My two kids have been with Swim Studio since they reached the qualified age of 4. Recently, the studio has improved its branding and safety measures by adding its logo to the swim caps, which is a great initiative.

Now, my children, who are almost 6 and 8 years old, are at Stage 1 and Stage 3, respectively. A big thank you to Coach Cindi for her patience and for making the lessons fun and enjoyable! She is a responsible coach who, despite her busy schedule, takes the initiative to send reminders to parents.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110784806382467801272/reviews

Davini,5,Liqi is an extremely patient and dedicated swim coach. She is successful in helping learners overcome their fear of deep water through fun and safe water activities. She practices active listening to ensure her learners learn and apply the correct method of swimming. Her reassuring approach builds confidence in swimmers and I'm glad I am a seasoned swimmer after a year of class with her when I started without much experience.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107705092056242127277/reviews
