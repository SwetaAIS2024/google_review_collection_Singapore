And not to mentioned it is free to if we cannot afford . Of course if we are able to pay we should pay. And its not that pricey either. Its just right. It was $60 a month if im not mistaken.",

In the toilet, no signal at all. Berak while not playing phones is the boring-iest things ever.\n\nThe carpet in mosque is okay. Delicious to pray pray.",
