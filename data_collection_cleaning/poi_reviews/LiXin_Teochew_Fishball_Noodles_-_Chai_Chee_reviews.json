It has plenty of ingredients, making it a colourful bowl. Fried fish cake is a must order, the meat is well seasoned and savoury. Fishball is not very Q and rather bland, likewise the soup. The noodles stole the show although famed for fishball.",

We ordered the fried fish sticks, which at $4 is very expensive given the small portion. Inflation is probably a common reason although I'd think it's not worth the price overall",

The soup was also rather bland. Somehow the seasoning for the noodles quite off. Saving grace were the fishcakes were pretty good.",
