Automotive lovers, do visit Millenia Walk on weekends, you sure will find at least 1-2 sports car there !\nIt’s a common place for car owners to gather and meet for lunch/coffee.\nThe mall is aesthetic. It has Great food, cafe, and it’s very accessible if you want to cross to Marina Square or Suntec City via shelter walkway. Also this place is packed yearly during F1, whereby F1 fans will come here to see and have a chance to meet their fellow racers and also one of the nearest exit to walk to the F1 zones.",
