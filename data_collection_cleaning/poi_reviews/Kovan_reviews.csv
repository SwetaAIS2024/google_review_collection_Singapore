Flo Yeow,4,"It's an MRT station that works for the surrounding neighborhood. It's clean, well structured, and connected to Heartland Mall. Is it any unique, no. Does it work as a public transportation facility, yes. If you're coming through Kovan or Hougang, you'll likely pass through this.

Just be mindful of which exit you're heading towards, or else you may be walking around blindly and end up walking a fair bit further.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Luke Phang,5,"Situated just after Serangoon and before Hougang, Kovan MRT is one of the northern station on the North East (Purple) MRT line. Notable landmarks here include 3 condos, 1 mall, 1 hawker center and numerous eating places.

People come to Kovan mostly for the food or to catch a bus to Tampines. It's tough to enter the train here during peak hours, as it's right smack between two concentrated places.

There are 3 exits at this station and the toilets are above ground. There is also OCBC ATM.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117681118694147432030/reviews
