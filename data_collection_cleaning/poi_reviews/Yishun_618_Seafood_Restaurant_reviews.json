Fish horfun is alright. Crab meat tofu is good. ÊéíÈ™®Áéã is good. Harcheongkai is good. Crab is good. Sambal sweet potato leaf is good.\n\nSitting at the back al fresco style is nice and chill, especially with the community garden next to you.",

Ordered for dine in and waited for 25 mins before I went to ask and realised it was put for takeaway. No one informed me that the food was ready even though the person who took the order heard wrongly. Disappointed with the service they gave for newcomers. Food was not at a standard where such treatment was justified. Try at your own risk if you are new to this place üòñ",
