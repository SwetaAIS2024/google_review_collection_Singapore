Liau Yuan Wei,5,"Ate dinner with my parents and partner here.
We had 1) Assam Fish Head 3) Three Way Egg Vegetables 3) Gong Bao Chicken Cubes

Generally the food tasted great and portions are generous. Service also very fast as we got our food within 10mins of ordering. One can PayNow instead of cash (but no PayWave). Total bill was $50 for 4 pax, which is priced allright for zichar",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101467908285337699109/reviews
