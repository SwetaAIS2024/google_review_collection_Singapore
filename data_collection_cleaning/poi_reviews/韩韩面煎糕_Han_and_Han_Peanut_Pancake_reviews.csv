Super Fragrance,5,"Ordered crispy pancake with peanut for $1.80.

Don't understand why it is more expensive than original when amount is lesser. Nevertheless it has all i am looking for in Chinese pancake the crispy and the sweet and savory peanut filling. A rare find.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
Raegan Loh,5,"Exceptional find in a neighborhood market. This is the chewy type MJK which is freshly made upon ordering. Highly recommend to eat this while it’s hot for the perfectly crispy “wings”. Generous dollop of the peanut spread which has a crunchy peanut butter consistency. The pancake thickness is just right as well - has a good, soft bouncy bite to it. Craving this again as I am typing out this review!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105599329046622290460/reviews

Jay Sng,5,"Come here for really good peanut pancake. But be prepared to wait and service is definitely not a strength here. The mood can be as gloomy as the thunderstorms in Sgp.
