Kristy Christy,1,"Hi SATS, if you’re going to hire a foreigner, at the very least, ensure they’re properly trained in basic customer respect. The lady at your counter was extremely rude, treating us as if we were criminals rather than travelers. Her attitude was unacceptable—nowhere near what should be expected at a check-in counter. We’re here to travel in good spirits, not to be disrespected or made to feel uncomfortable. Please make sure she receives proper training before placing her back at the front desk to deal with your customers or passengers again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109425545174528688995/reviews
