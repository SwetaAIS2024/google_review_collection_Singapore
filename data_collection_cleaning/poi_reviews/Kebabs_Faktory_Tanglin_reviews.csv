Bren A,1,"Second and last visit here.
I had ordered hummus and corn chips.. the staff heard it as chips.. like fries. And then he tells me he can't change it as it is already fried. On top of that, he didn't mention there's an additional surcharge for the fries.
The first visit, they ran out of chicken, and only had tikka chicken. They did not mention that that was additional.
Oh. And what some people mention about lack of hygiene is true. They always touch the food with bare hands, even after touching the cashiering machine.
This place does not seem very hygienic nor honest.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116328377056822464274/reviews

Update, after follow up from mgmt we had the opportunity to try the food.  Both the lamb and chicken exceeded our expectations.  Meat was tender and the flavors were authentically well balanced.  We asked for it to be spicy and it definitely hit the spot.  Overall good value for the quality and taste, and the service was much better.   I hope they can keep up the standards, will definitely will be back when in the area.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106756360162747615051/reviews
U Ahsan,4,"We recently visited (June 2024) and had a delightful dining experience. We ordered two wraps and a kids meal. We tried the gyro wrap and lamb wrap, both of which were good. The wraps had tender meat and complemented perfectly with vegetables and tasty sauces. The serving size was generous. Each wrap was hearty and filled us up nicely. The kids meal was also ample, providing a good portion size for a child. The kids meal was a hit with our little one. It was well-portioned and came with a nice variety of items that were both tasty and kid-friendly. It's always a plus when a restaurant takes the time to cater to younger diners with the same care and quality as they do for adults.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115269218839280629625/reviews
