Hoong Wai Wong,4,"Keep forgetting to take pictures whenever I eat here, at least once a week.

The roast duck, roast chicken, char siew are not spectacular, ok can eat.
But for the cheap price it is very value for money.

The service and friendliness is impeccable, auntie can remember your usual orders and can chat.

The coffee shop is rather warm and stuffy, endurable cos usually just eat and go.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106237336061537561898/reviews
