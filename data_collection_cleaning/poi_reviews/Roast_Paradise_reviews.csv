Chong How,4,"I think the price is q expensive, roasted pork is the usual standard you wld get somewhere outside, with $5.50 price with soup. Not so affordable.. Wld think NTUC downstairs is better, $5.30 with duck and roast pork",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116852952092019913610/reviews
Phyu Sin Myat,5,usually don’t write reviews but i had this for dinner today and it’s one of the best roast pork rice i’ve had. it’s hard to find a generous portion roast pork rice that isn’t too salty and affordable imo. flavorful and yummy (loved the chili too) maybe the only downside i would say is that it wasn’t crispy (which didn’t really bother me). i was so satisfied and will definitely come back in the future. $5.5,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110396972719253469878/reviews
Shawn Lim,3,"Price is too high. Food is tasty but have to think rice
Imagine paying 17$ for duck leg and pork belly.
I paid 12$ for my duck noodle + charsiew + add meat and look at the amount of duck they are giving",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116318284490548474431/reviews
Bonnibelle Hoo,3,"Overall food standard is WAY WAY WAY LOWER as compared to old airport outlet. My mom told me not to try it but I don’t believe. Rice is NOT as fragrant, roasted meat NOT as fragrant.  Only consistent thing is the chilli. What a disappointment and waste of my $7.30",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112696930833971352673/reviews
w wong,1,"I bought a packet of Char Siew rice to take home, but what I got was disappointing.
Instead of the usual Char Siew pork, it was just a small slab of Char Siew fat
- and no, I’m not exaggerating! It was literally just a chunk of fat,
with a thin layer of roast on top to mask it.

On top of that, the rice was undercooked today, which made the whole meal even worse.

This wasn’t the first time I had an unpleasant experience. The last time I bought their Roast Duck
- it came with some loose pieces of tough, hard meat
- the kind that seems like the stall wanted to discard,
but decided to serve to customers buying their more expensive set meals.

Today was the last straw. I won't be eating from here again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112010417396180484747/reviews
