HC Lum,3,"It’s as traditional as it seems but just they are just resell. Nothing was made on the spot. Bamboo Shoots Soon Kueh is very difficult to find and they came with a price as well. But I think their skin it’s a little bit too thick for the kueh, probably need to hold the amount of bamboo shoots. As for the Black Kueh, it’s black sesame sweet filling inside. Both kueh I tried are decent and although the skin is thick, it’s enjoyable chewy at the same time. You may wan to try their mini version for tasting.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107295031316336799609/reviews
