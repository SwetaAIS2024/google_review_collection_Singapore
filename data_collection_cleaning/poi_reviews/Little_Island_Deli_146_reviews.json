      "text": "It's one of the food and drink booths at Kallang Stadium, and it's honestly extremely underwhelming. Given that they seemingly use part time employees, the entire process was very haphazard, and it felt very much like a school canteen.\n\nThe cashiers weren't very friendly or familiar with their devices, when the menu is already so short. I had difficulty telling them I wanted my Cabernet Sauvignon, because they only know it as red wine. Given the huge markup that I'm already paying, and to have such an experience, is unacceptable.\n\nIn any case, given that I'm rarely here, and that there are many other stalls all around the stadium anyways, it's fine.",
