Ordered the new year promo and all 4 pizza taste horrible cold and hard. Cinnamon bread was cold and hard.  spoilt our new year celebration becus of your lousy food. It's indeed a shame as my past dinning experience with Domino Australia was good. üò≠. Decided to give your pizza a pass from now onwards üçï",

I haven't tried Grab Domino but I guess I will choose pickup next time if I have the time to go pickup.\n\nIf my calls wasn't pickup by the worker in Jalan Kayu, I will only suffer because I think foodpanda has some issue with its system where I couldn't report missing items even though the indicated delivered.\n\nThank you for recovery order of my food and delivered to my house. Also, thanks for the giving me extra pizza for my lost. I was so glad that worker in Jalan Kayu finally answered my call after 10 calls. Thank you so much! I felt much better.",

      "text": "A really bad experience ordering Domino's for dinner. First, the chicken kickers smell rotten or spoiled. The texture of the  meat was soft and slimy... Didn't want to risk food poisoning so threw it away.\n\nNext, the pizza boxes did not have those little plastic supports so the top of the boxes collapsed onto the pizzas. The pepperoni pizza dough was undercooked in some parts and I can taste the raw dough.\n\nFinally the cheese bowl-cano, errr.... cheese \"platter\"...  Tasted like really cheap processed cheese from a can.\n\nOnly good thing was the speedy delivery and got our pizzas within the hour.\n\n70 dollars for this quality,  adios Domino's!",
