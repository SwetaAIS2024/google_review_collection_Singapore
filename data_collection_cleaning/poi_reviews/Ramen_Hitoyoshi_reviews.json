      "text": "Typical Tonkotsu Ramen shop with variety of ramen dishes and sides on offer. Good tonkotsu broth and choice of noodle thickness/doneness allows for some level of customization. Overall, it’s a treat, but the broth feels a bit too reliant on salt and the portions of soup is a bit low be the noodles.\n\nThe staff is helpful without becoming pushy.\n\nCustomers should take note that the prices quoted on menu are pre-GST. This makes the overall price of a meal a bit higher than most other ramen places. While the quality is also higher than most (it reminds me of the ramen from packed street restaurants in Japan), I’m not exactly sure that alone can justify the hike entirely.",

All in all will definitely go back and try the non-spicy.\n\nThe auntie-lady staff was lovely too and assists us warmly.",

The only thing I would say to avoid is the normal chashu (1 long piece of meat). Apart from that, everything else I’ve tried is tasty (only tried noodle dishes). I really like the free beansprout as well, always dumping a large amount into my ramen for a crunchy texture.",
