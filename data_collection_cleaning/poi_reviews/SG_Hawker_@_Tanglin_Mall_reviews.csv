Hui Yee Seah,3,"Food is tasty, staff is friendly. But it‚Äôs disappointing that the shop uses disposable utensils (bowls, cups, cutleries) even though the customers are dining in. Very wasteful and damaging to the environment. Will not be eating here again until the management stops this unnecessary use of plastic.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116287494690755761397/reviews
Herk Ng,1,"The person cooking noodles and taking orders was incredibly rude and nasty to everyone. He didn't want to listen to my order, then when he got it wrong, he raised his voice at me. He made a new bowl, but it ended up looking like the below.

The photo below shows a ""dry"" noodle. I could barely taste the sauce with the amount of liquid swirling inside.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111560781906012412058/reviews
Marie Chang,1,"I would give this place zero stars if I could. I came here with my husband and 1 year old daughter and sat at a table that had 4 seats. This old cleaning lady told me (rudely) to go over to the table for 2 seats since we only had 2 people. I pointed at my daughter in response and told her that we had 3 people and that table is way too squeezy for us especially with a toddler that grabs everything in sight. She disregarded me and said that my daughter isn‚Äôt counted since she isn‚Äôt eating. We simply walked off, not wanting to make a scene and she said something equivalent to ‚Äúgood riddance‚Äù. I‚Äôm honestly appalled at this. I‚Äôm not expecting 5 star service but this level of rudeness and discrimination for a family with a young child is completely unacceptable at any establishment.

We used to frequent this place and yes we know this cleaning lady has an attitude but this is the last straw. Will NEVER return unless they completely revamp their service staff/model.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109896251289023696625/reviews
Merryheart,3,This place serves Singapore hawker food inside Tanglin Mall.  Pricing is reasonable which is comparable to outside hawker price. Good choice for a quick meal or snack. Quality of food is acceptable but the staffs were not attentive.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101391398296811227556/reviews
Kai,1,"Had my lunch at this place.

Ordered the curry rice and braised pork and cutlet.

Braised gravy is too sweet to my likings, egg is totally dry ü§¢ and the braised pork is like 80% fats‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Quite a disappointing meal and possibly one of the worst Hainanese curry rice I ever had.

My first and last‚Ä¶..",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117612273412230021726/reviews
