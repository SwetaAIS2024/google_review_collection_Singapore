They have been there every step of the way guiding and instructing us what to do and expect.\nThe package covers all needs from the beginning to the last send off. Every little needs and requirements are looked into.\nThe team is even ready to hand out tissue to family members. Such a simple act but it shows that they are extremely sensitive to the family needs and atmosphere.\nSet up for the wake is elegant and professional. We were informed of the timing of every step from the set up and tear down.\nOur family appreciates and thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the superb professional service!!\nLastly thank you too for upgrading the hearse to the Maserati. It gives great dignity to the deceased.\nSpecial shout out to Eugene the funeral director assigned. We appreciate your service.\nThank you, Elson for the complimentary coffee machine. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

      "text": "The level of service by Serenity Funeral Service is superb. From the time of activation until the time that the funeral service is over, the physical and spiritual support was endless. Their punctuality and guidance throughout was truly commendable, as this was my first time organising a funeral for a loved one. We have been greatly blessed by their services. We only needed to call them and inform them our need when my brother passed away. They were able to effectively advise and recommended suitable funeral package according to our financial ability. All the necessary bookings for the funeral wake to the cremation and ash management were fully organised from start to finish. Their logistical partner also gave their full support and set up the wake location within 2 hours, and the wake went full steam thereafter. My family and I were deeply grateful for their seamless support, making our difficult time more bearable.",
