Wong Family,1,"A extremely rude staff. She gave me the wrong timing of receiving my email and said she was referring to my last wed email; which clearly in simple English meant last week - however I was referring to just yesterday which was wed this week.
With the confusion of wrong timing and wrong date, I was just asking if she is referring to my email - she then became rude and just hung up! Worse experience ever",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110013828588764355187/reviews
