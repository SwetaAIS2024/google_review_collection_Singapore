j c,2,"Shopee parcel collection is smooth at this shop. Beware the store keepers will ask you to ""buy something please"" While I usually do try to get something from them while collecting my parcels, my peeve is they do not have much things and they have no price tags on their items. So how would I know how much something cost or if they would just key in whatever price they want. Also, the store keepers have NEVER smile or say thank you or anything else polite to me or anyone other customers at the shop while I'm there. Come on, you guys rely on our business. Is it very hard to be polite? Will your faces crack to smile?",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114203978711818633605/reviews

Christine A. Lee,1,The worst Shopee collection point ever! Refused to release my parcel even though I've received a message from Shopee that it is ready for collection. No customers and quiet day but they refuse as they don't entertain collection on Sunday and public holidays even though they are open and there's no customers around. Twice they kept asking my mom to purchase something when she went to collect her parcel. Very unethical and Shopee should stop using them.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107385167265235290270/reviews
Xenia Tan,1,"My recent experience at this store was incredibly disappointing and unprofessional. Despite it being the last day for Shopee parcel collection, the store refused to accommodate me, citing a non-existent queue on a quiet Sunday. It was evident that there were no other customers present at the time of my visit.

Moreover, the staff's attempt to coerce me into making a purchase by offering assistance with my parcel collection was appalling and unethical. This manipulative behavior is unacceptable in any business setting.

I urge others to avoid patronizing this store due to their lack of customer service and questionable business practices. My trust in this establishment has been completely shattered, and I will be blacklisting them from my future shopping endeavors.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116261112855862305634/reviews
Bill Z,4,Just collected my Shopee parcel here for the first time - was worried when I read the other reviews but it was ok and smooth to collect. Same for others beside me too. There is a wait but understandable as there are other paying customers and the staff need time to find your parcel amongst a few boxes.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102935257637340345313/reviews
