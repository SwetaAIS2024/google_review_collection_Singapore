      "text": "Smash Tennis Academy has been fantastic for my 8-year-old daughter! She's been attending group lessons with Coach De En for two years now, and she's grown so much. The classes are small, up to 4 kids, so she gets plenty of attention. Coach De En is great with kids, making the lessons fun and engaging. My daughter is now able to play and really enjoys tennis every week. Highly recommend!",

Coach Wilson easily spotted my mistakes and corrected them in an easy-to-understand way, allowing me to quickly grasp the essentials and get into the proper state. I've already recommended them to my friends and neighbors ✌️ I hope I can learn to play tennis correctly with ease and joy soon! haha​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",
