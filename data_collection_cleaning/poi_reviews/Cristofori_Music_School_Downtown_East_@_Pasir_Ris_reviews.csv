Eliza,5,"Just started a few weeks of violin lesson for my 4-year-old with Cristofori Downtown East. My son will definitely continue his music learning journey with this school.

The admin staff, especially Mr Edmund was very helpful. He went the extra miles to make sure my requirements were met. His replies were prompt and he was very good at giving suggestions to encourage me to eventually gave Cristofori a try. He wasn‚Äôt hard sell and impatient. He is friendly, efficient and undoubtedly one of the best music school admin staff I have ever met.

The violin teacher, Miss Vicky is very accommodating and patient. She is able to be friendly with my son and at the same time be firm with him. He has been following the lessons and often surprised me with how well he is comprehending her instructions. Miss Vicky is flexible with her approaches in teaching violin to toddlers and she is comfortable to allow me to sit in during the violin lesson.

All in all, i am having a very positive and pleasant experience with this music school.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106953726141887789238/reviews
