USA Ribeye my first time trying - a bit fatty otherwise it is delicious cos pretty tender. Mushroom sauce is fragrant. Potato puree is very smooth and taste is just right for me. Oh peppermint tea is very fragrant too. Will recommend and come again.",

      "text": "Overall food taste: 3.5/5‚≠êÔ∏è Finally dropped by to dine in at this place after seeing some previous good reviews! I had the fish & chips - a menu item I was looking forward to try after coming across those few positive reviews. I liked that the fillets were rather sizeable and nicely deep fried - not too greasy/overdoneüëçüèª and fries were crisp and light as well. Salad was quite refreshing too. My order came with tomato soup (of the day) as appetiser, which tasted quite ok though a tad lukewarm.\n\nOnly gripe would be that the fillets tasted extremely healthy and bland - seemingly as if cooked without any seasoning at all. Not a problem for the super health-conscious; I personally would prefer this to it being overly salty/oily, but may not be to the liking of majority.\nMy plate was replaced after the waiter initially served the food though, as he somehow noted that the original fillets served were notably smaller in portion size (than pictured previously) and appeared much oilier to me as wellü§î. Kudos to the kind gesture though, much appreciated!üíØ\nWould probably try the other menu items if I drop by again in futureüôÇ",
