Chee's Cafe Corner is a fantastic takeaway home-based business that has become my go-to spot for coffee and bubble tea. The variety they offer is impressive for a Home-based business, with options that cater to all ages in the family. Whether you're in the mood for a classic coffee or craving a refreshing bubble tea, they have it all.

The prices are very affordable, making it easy to treat yourself without breaking the bank. The quality of the beverages is excellent, and you can tell they use top-notch ingredients. I particularly love their iced americano and match latte, which is always perfectly made and delicious.

The convenience of a home-based takeaway/delivery service within the district is perfect for the neighborhood, and the friendly service makes the experience even better. Chee's Cafe Corner is a true gem in the neighborhood. Highly recommend giving them a try!

PS very cute design of their logo on the cup and the kids are learning how to do deliveries in their neighborhood!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105741370999723276499/reviews
Zhi LianG,5,"My wife super love the ice lemonade. Till we forgot to take the photo!! Super refreshing for recent hot humid weather.

Had also ordered cafe latte and hazelnut latte (packeted, super convenient to drink it the next day). IMO, why ordered from Starbucks when Chee‚Äôs coffee is better/cheaper. Most importantly easy to order if you‚Äôre staying near this cafe. Will definitely ordered again!

The Boss is friendly and talkative too.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112626840713493806780/reviews
Darwin Goh,5,"Bought the latte, orange americano, matcha latte and chocolate drink and we absolutely love them all. I personally love the matcha latte and the orange americano. The matcha is thick and smooth and the orange americano have a good sweet and tangy flavour to the coffee. üëçüèªüëçüèª",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103622049936791511157/reviews
