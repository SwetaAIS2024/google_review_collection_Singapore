Right from the moment we stepped into the clinic, we were welcomed with genuine warmth and utmost professionalism by the friendly staff. Jason's expertise and meticulous approach were evident throughout the entire examination process. He took the time to carefully explain the results, ensuring we fully understood them, and patiently recommended me spectacle models that were suitable for me and my wife’s face shape. We wholeheartedly recommend Jason from OJO to anyone seeking a highly knowledgeable and compassionate optometrist.",

      "text": "Stumbled upon OJO optometry and was attended to by Jason. Bought my contact lenses and Jason very kindly shared with me samples of products I was interested in (coloured contacts, lens solution etc). Knowing that I was also uncertain about trying a new range of coloured contacts, Jason offered a pair of dailys before committing to a purchase. Thank you for the dedicated service & thoughtfulness! The team gifted an umbrella too.\n\nHonestly recommend Jason and team for anyone looking for good service and product range!",

To my surprise they was very diligence in helping me. The whole process from finding a spectacle to my liking, eye check, payment and getting my spectacle was fast. They took about 10-15minute time to do my spectacle. I am grateful that I pass by this shop and decided to give it a try. And they were all very friendly. Special shoutout to Amirah, as she was really nice and patient while doing all the eye check for me. I would highly recommend this place!",
