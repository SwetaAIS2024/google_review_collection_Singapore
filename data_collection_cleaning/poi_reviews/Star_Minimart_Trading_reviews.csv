Gin & Garfield,5,"I was here to collect my Shopee parcel. Couldn't find it on google maps, so i helped him set up on google maps. Hope it can bring more business to this small shop and also to help others/shopee members find the shop. Haha. Uncle is friendly and helpful.
There are plenty of parking lots here as well. Also, there is a carpark exit (exit only) that is very near the shop. So, don't need to worry about parking fees. Just collect and go.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107353623863604624641/reviews
