Aehs Lee,4,"Not only dimsum but 燒臘 roast duck / meat / chicken is recommended with wonton noodles. Best combi-portion too.

Service wise really depends on moods",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109979942438073241191/reviews
FoodieDirectory,3,Chanced upon this HK dim sum restaurant. Opened in 2020. Not bad tasting but paying restaurant prices for coffee shop atmosphere isn’t exactly affordable. Having said that dim sum is better than Kimly etc. Just not as good as your regular dim sum restaurant.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114040935321134660301/reviews

dorisyong,3,"There is Hong Kong style herbal duck and the usual chicken rice and other roasted meat fare. There’s also healthy herbal soup and clay pot rice. There’s also a dim sum stall selling a variety of dim sum and porridge. Then there are the ubiquitous drink stall, Muslim prata and zi char stalls.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101978539412430365487/reviews
