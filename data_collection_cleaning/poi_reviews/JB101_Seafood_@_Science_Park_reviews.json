      "text": "Free parking is available on Sundays for visitors. There’s no GST or service charge, but that also means you shouldn’t expect any service.\n\nThe restaurant has both indoor and outdoor play areas for kids, which is a nice touch, though they don’t seem well-maintained.\n\nUtensils were quite oily, so if you’re particular about cleanliness, you might want to give them another rinse before using them.\n\nAs for the food, the taste was average, and the dishes we ordered had a very watery texture. A portion of rice costs $1.60.",

It is a popular zi char restaurant in Singapore, renowned for its authentic Johor Bahru–style dishes infused with rich wok hei flavors. They have live band too! Awesome place to chill over the weekend indeed!",

For birthdays they play happy birthday song through the restaurant when the cake is served. The cereal prawn was below average as the flour was very thick. The ingredients generally also tasted like they were frozen.",
