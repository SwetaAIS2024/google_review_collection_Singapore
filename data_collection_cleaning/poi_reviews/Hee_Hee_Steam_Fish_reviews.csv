Lili Ang,5,First time trying. I ordered the steamed sea bass. It's fresh and tender. Really tasty. It's served with 2 types of dipping sauce.  It doesn't come with rice but you can add it at 70¬¢. Can easily serve 2 pax. I look forward to trying other dishes.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115950409953847040271/reviews
MH & El,5,"[CLEMENTI EATS] üêüüç≤ WHOLE POMFRET AT $12 IN THIS ECONOMY?! Consider me sold! Have previously tried the steamed seafood sets at Hee Hee Hee Steamed Fish in Toa Payoh, super stoked it has opened an outlet in Clementi! The Golden Pomfret üêüserved Hong Kong style was very fresh considering it‚Äôs in a hawker setting, meat was supple and the flavors enhanced by the soy sauce, ginger and minced garlic! Each set also comes with two dipping sauces to add that extra kick to your fresh seafood!

Also got the BB‚Äôs parents seal of approval (quote BB papa: ‚Äútastes like BB mama‚Äôs cooking‚Äù) after recommending to them! Other seafood options available include Grouper & Bamboo Clams!

laine ooi,5,"Affordable and delicious steamed seafood dishes. I recommend the nai bai over the okra as the okra releases its soluble fibre, which can be unpleasant to some due to it's wet/soggy texture

Hawker was very friendly and gave us extra coriander and spring onions !

Overall a great experience, would definitely come again :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115995247149745539344/reviews
Chris Chong,5,We were drawn to this stall as we noticed many others having it for lunch. It was delicious and did not cost as much as we expected. Ordered the otah steamed egg & $12 flower grouper. Just enough for 2 pax. Deciding on the seabass or pomfret for our next visit.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110006550653359996461/reviews
