Trevor Cherry,5,"Great food selection. Tempura is excellent, as is the barbecued meat, and the ramen is delicious. We have eaten here twice and will certainly be visiting on a regular basis.
Update: on a further recent visit we tried the soft shell crab salad and it was excellent. I definitely recommend it. We also had the Tonkatsu Ramen, which was equally delicious and some of the very tasty BBQ meats.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111071622328259984171/reviews
sze yah chng,4,"Their food actually taste better than it looks. The draught beer is nice, ramen a bit too normal, yakitori better avoid, too dry; cha Siew rice not bad but most outstanding is their garlic fried rice, using the stone bowl and make it tastier. Good service",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101633724786132733500/reviews
Shangjun Tang,5,"Excellent Japanese food with decent portion sizes. Sashimi was fresh. Chirashi Don came with generous servings of sashimi on top.

The shoyu ramen was wonderful. Delicious broth, and melt in your mouth char shu with a nice charred aroma.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103421812749620822313/reviews

Not much choices of restaurant in Puteri Habour, and this is the only Japanese restaurant here.

Surprisingly they serve good quality of food with very reasonable price.

However, they are short staffed, only 1 crew serving at the front line. Therefore pls prepared for waiting and pls be patience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113794925681437435909/reviews
C Mm,5,"The food was superb and the service was wonderful the 2 times we were there. Even though the wait was long for dinner tonight, the wait staff served us promptly, paid attention and attended to us whenever we needed help. I'm impressed at the level of service even though they were busy.

Place was filled with Japanese tonight and it seems packed nightly. My kids love the food there too.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113556629514653478404/reviews
