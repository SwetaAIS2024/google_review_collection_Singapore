Aunn really came through with my vision for my wedding day look. She made my skin glow and worked to make my features stand out in all the right ways. She was also so easy to feedback to and worked tirelessly with an amazing work ethic to take notes and revision what would make the look better! I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better make up artist.",

She made sure I was happy with all the details and was happy to tweak things here and there when requested. She's also a great conversationalist and talking to her helped distract me from wedding nerves. Thank you!",

Shu Zhen, the founder of Canvaseety, was the one who did my pre-wedding photoshoot makeup. As a recent bride herself, she really knew how to allay all my wedding jitters and we ended up having such a great time together that the entire makeup process flew by so quickly!\n\nShu's comforting presence, makeup skillset and eye for detail really made me feel so beautiful and confident during my PWS. We didn't have a makeup trial previously so it was really all trust, her expertise, and good vibes but she colour matched me so well and really knew how to bring out my best! Canvaseety has some of the best wedding makeup artists in Singapore, and I can vouch from the bottom of my heart that every bride is in good hands with them! Thank you so much Shu Zhen & team at Canvaseety!!!",
