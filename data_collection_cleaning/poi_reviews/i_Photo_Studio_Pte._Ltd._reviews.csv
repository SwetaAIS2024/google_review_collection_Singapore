nabila deviriana,1,My mother wanted to take her photo for ic here and the employee was very rude to her. Adjusted her hijab so roughly and without her permission to do so eventhough my mother's hijab was already fine and wasnt going against any guidelines. Charged $14 for 4 pieces of photos eventhough their photo was unclear and bad quality. The lady took her picture so insincerely. Wont repeat taking pictures here again.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110415986039248895456/reviews

Nur 'Iffah Sofea,1,"The lady staff there was really rude. Requested for help but was showing attitude and reluctance even while helping. Went there before last time and thought of giving them a chance again but was deeply disappointed. However, would like to commend the lady boss who is really nice and would help willingly.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117226459417619004729/reviews
Herculie Phyo,1,I should have heed the other's bad reviews. I brought my 5y.o. son to take passport photo. The lady there was so impatient right from the beginning. The way she spoke to us is so impatient and rude.  Avoid them at all cost.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106610845876466158976/reviews
Yaz,1,If u hv a choice pls do not visit them. No time to travel to my usual store in Hougang so I had to opt for this terrible option. The ladies there are extremely rude & impatient. Immediately dismissed off my request when I was checking if a pic can be blown up to A4 size. I was shocked when she asked me if the frame was A4 size when she shld knw it better working in a photo shop?!,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108043937884965975665/reviews
