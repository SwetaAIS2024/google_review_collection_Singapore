      "text": "Situated at the new revamped and refurbished food court at E!Hub Downtown East.\n\nThe multiple highlights and photos of why their minced meat noodles are cooked and prepped with perfection really deceiving.\n\nApart from cooking the noodles and the ingredients satisfactorily (like any other food stalls), their broth/soup is pretty tasteless. Like out from the tap water and being boiled without much base.\n\nThey could do with pork bone/ribs/femurs with salted fish as base of the soup to excite the taste buds but otherwise it’s below average for a “Signature Minced Meat” dish which I paid for $9.80!",
