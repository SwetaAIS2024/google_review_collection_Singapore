      "text": "Used to frequent this shop at Thomson Plaza but since they closed their unit there - it has been a challenge to find a shop like theirs!\n\nHuge collection of toys that is different from Toy R Us? They have toys and play things that are closer to heart (maybe toys characters that parents know more of) unlike commercialised toys on adverts. They also sell newer trendier toys like the new concept of blind boxes “Gachapon”.\n\nOne thing awesome is that they have board games for younger ages i.e. before 7,8 years old; between 5-7 years old. Budding age to introduce board games before primary one!\nSuch better traditional board games are harder to source, the newer ones in malls are great too - but just different.\n\nMassive lego collection as well :) even dated collectible ones if you’re big fan of building!\n\nMany other knick knacks as well or on-the-go games; which would probably be a better option than Roblox and Minecraft :”) to an extent.\n\nDefinitely a go-to if you’re near that area!",

      "text": "PLEASE AVOID. UNPLEASANT AND DISHONEST. We bought two fidget spinners from toy station for $30 each. The sales assistant had said that the $9 ones were out of stock. Within a day a part of the spinner came off n it was unusable. I brought It back and The Indian owner refuses to take responsibility for it. He says that he tells people that it is fragile (?? It's for kids!) n it's non refundable, both of which the sales person did NOT tell me or else I would have looked for a cheaper model. His exact words \"even if you had walked out and it it got broken in 5 minutes I can't do anything. Much less in one day\". Very unpleasant. Avoid.",

He was flexible enough for me to purchase via PayNow and for me to arrange my own delivery. Overall good customer experience. I will go back for more :)",
