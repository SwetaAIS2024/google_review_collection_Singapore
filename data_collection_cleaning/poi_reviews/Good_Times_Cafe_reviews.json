      "text": "Stepping into ‚ÄúGood Times Cafe‚Äù feels like flipping through the pages of a vintage scrapbook. Nestled in a space that channels the charm of a bygone kampong (traditional village), this eatery is a love letter to nostalgia, with its weathered wooden furniture, retro posters, and knickknacks like old radios and enamelware. The ambiance alone is worth the visit for those yearning to relive simpler times‚Äîthink communal wooden benches, rusted tin signs, and the warm glow of hanging lanterns.\n\nThe menu is a treasure trove of old-school snacks and dishes, from kaya toast with soft-boiled eggs to ba zhang to home-made kuay. While the food delivers a comforting wave of familiarity, the flavors themselves are hit-or-miss. The snacks, though fun to share, tread closer to just okay than memorable.It‚Äôs clear the focus here leans more on evoking nostalgia than culinary excellence.\n\nService, however, is a bright spot. The staff radiates warmth, greeting guests with genuine smiles and patience, especially when explaining menu items to younger diners unfamiliar with kampong-era bites.\n\nThat said, the prices feel steep for the experience. While the retro vibe and friendly service justify a slight premium, some dishes cost noticeably more than similar offerings at heritage hawker stalls or even competing themed cafes.\n\nVerdict: Good Times Cafe is a delightful spot for a trip down memory lane, perfect for sharing stories over childhood snacks or introducing younger generations to the aesthetics of the past. But if you‚Äôre seeking bold flavors or value-for-money meals, temper your expectations. Go for the ambiance and nostalgia‚Äînot the food‚Äîand you‚Äôll leave with a smile (and maybe a few Instagram snaps).",

      "text": "Tried Good Times at Eco Botanic on Saturday morning. Waited about 10 min for a table. Food wise rather retro and authentic Malaysia taste. Tried pork porridge, wanton noodle, nasi lemak, meat ball, and black coffee. Taste wise wanton noodle is fragrant with pork lard in it. The soy sauce tastes good. Nasi lemak chilli is nice and not the sweet type. Meat ball available on weekend and taste good as well. Worth to visit again if crave for local and retro Malaysia food.",
