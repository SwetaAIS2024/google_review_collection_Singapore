Jeremiah SW,5,"Owner was very friendly, helpful to bring out toys to introduce and show to me when I popped by this afternoon. They have pretty wide variety of Starwars and Marvel collectibles. There are uncommon and rarer pieces as well. Check them out!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103651829987359561256/reviews
Winston Goh2,5,"Toybros stocks up with old and new toys that I don't see in normal retail stores or toy shops. Unique. Fairly priced. Some hard-to-get ones are there too. Sometimes, they have back issue comics from mid 1970s onwards. Highly recommended ü§†üëç",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114085134904366681690/reviews

Jun Boon Tan,5,"Came to Queensway randomly and came across Toybros! It was a pleasant surprise to see this small shop decked out with Marvel Legends, Star Wars The Black Series, and some not so common items you would see in retail stores. Prices were reasonable too.

Additionally, they were really passionate  about toys and collecting them.

I highly recommend visiting them and would definitely come again.

To note, they accept Paynow/Cash only.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110153666335365506113/reviews
Jay Jay,1,"Long story short, came across this seller on carousel, was told last piece available is his shop, listing stated $50, price suddenly increase to $65 after offer was made then mark as it‚Äôs sold, still can say nothing to do with toysbro. It‚Äôs obviously your shop. Can simply just explain you not willing to sell it at $50 right now.
