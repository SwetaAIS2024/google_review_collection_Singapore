Each procedure went well, and the recovery process was seamless, with no complications.\n\nThe cost was also relatively affordable, particularly with the ability to utilise Medisave, which made the process more accessible and manageable.\n\nI would like to extend my thanks to Grace, who was consistently helpful, responsive, and reassuring throughout my visits. I’m also deeply appreciative of Dr. Bruce, whose professionalism and clear communication made the procedures far less daunting.",

Both were professional, efficient and made the whole scaling and polishing pain free and relaxed.\nDr Lisa always only does what is appropriate and necessary . She doesn't recommend procedures which may be aesthetic but not beneficial in view of my age and condition of my teeth and that is much appreciated.",
