Hau Keong Yoong,5,"This food court, located within one of the country clubs in Singapore, is a hidden gem serving some of the most delicious local fare. Signature dishes like Singapore laksa, Hokkien mee, and prawn noodles are highly recommended for their rich flavors and authentic taste. The prices are very reasonable, the portions are generous, and the service is impressively fast—making it a perfect spot for a satisfying and fuss-free meal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108275806822915842503/reviews
JATHL,5,"Nice, relaxing setting, although there isn’t a good view of the golf course. Open to public.
Tried their stir fried laksa which had a mix of yellow noodles and thick rice vermicelli, 3 prawns, squid rings and tofu puff slices. Quite a moreish dish but I would think a bit more protein and a bit less carbs would be ideal. Didn’t like that the prawns weren’t deveined.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110357299060106350854/reviews
WT Wong,3,"Overpriced and average quality food .
Ordered Kopi C but glass was half full! Wanted to order their monthly promotion item, but E menu stated as ‘Sold Out ‘, time of order was before noon.
Lack of attentive service staff as there were many part timers . Would expect higher level of service is a clubhouse .",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116204037022034321113/reviews
Eve C,5,A pleasant find in an unexpected location.  Very nice restaurant serving delicious local food. Service was good. The signature fried chicken wings are a bit overrated with the high price. The chicken rice with breast meat tastes very dry. The rest are good. Restaurant overlooking the golf course. Outdoor and indoor seating avail. Very nice flowers ceiling design.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews
Michelin Inspector,4,I had the korean beef bibimbap. Delicious since its served on stone pot. They could have added more beef. The buffalo wings are delicious. But the wings could be crispier and spicier.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108167496990200967081/reviews
