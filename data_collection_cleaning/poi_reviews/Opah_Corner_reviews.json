Where else can you find affordable nasi sambal goreng, lontong, mee rebus in Singapore?\n\nReviewers want to complain about the taste when they couldn't afford something better. I'm pretty sure the food was what you could only afford and the most convenient for you, hence you opted to buy it at that point of time.\n\nYou want high quality nasi lemak you go restaurant and spend more. You want cheapest nasi lemak you go and travel to ananas. Make your reviews make sense before you write.",

Tasteless and sticky rice, fish fillet that taste like flour with very gross texture, missed out ikan bilis, asked for a little more sambal but the makcik asked: “how much you want? Want extra need to pay hor”. I don’t usually give google review but i really have to do it for this.",
