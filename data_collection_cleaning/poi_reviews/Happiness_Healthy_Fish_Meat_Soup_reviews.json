The soup is tasty, the serving size is good, and I’d recommend the Fried Fish with Bitter Gourd. Can’t go wrong for anyone after fulfilling local comfort food.",

That explained the curt replies and hurried service.\n\nBeing the only fish soup stall in the area also meant there are no reasons to improve. So, nothing has changed in the last five years since I moved into the area.\n\nThe plus factors are affordability and consistency.",

More than fair value for the money.\nWould have given higher rating but I prefer the soup stock more robust than the style here.",
