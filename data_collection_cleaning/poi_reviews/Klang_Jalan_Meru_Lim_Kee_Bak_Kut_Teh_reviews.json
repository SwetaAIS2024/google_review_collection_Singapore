      "text": "Bakut Teh Series\n\nBakut Teh (Pork Ribs Soup) & Braised Pig Trotters (滷豬腳）are two of my favourite SG dishes.\n\nApart from those \"famous\" restaurants (some are seriously over rated) selling these two dishes (yes, most of the time these two dishes are sold together in the same food outlets), I am always interested to try out other stalls in hawker centers and coffeeshops.\n\nThis particular stall caught my eyes after my morning walk. I decided to try it out.\n\nIt claims to be the ONLY AUTHENTIC Klang Bakut Teh! But I don't know how Klang Bakut Teh tastes like.\n\nAnyway, I ordered 1 claypot of pork ribs. Guess how much it costs?\n\nI was surprised that the boss asked me to go back to my seat and wait, he will serve my food shortly! Wah, that's really old style! No need self service, no need to wait for number calling nor take an electronic token... Whatever!\n\nI was even more surprised when the boss serve my Bakut Teh! It's not the typical coffeeshop or hawker center style but the two different fried bean curds (tou pok you kua) were served separately!\n\nThe pork rib soup was serve with much pride, with tou kee properly covered over the soup.\n\nWhat's left is the taste test.\n\nIt surprised me again as it didn't have the usual overdosage of pepper or garlic. The soup was tasty and smooth!\n\nThe only imperfection is that the meat on the pork ribs wasn't tender enough.\n\nTo achieve tenderness in pork ribs or pig trotters, these must be cooked for a prolonged period with simmer fire. This is one area that the stall could improve on and that would make the whole dish PERFECT!\n\nOn the other hand, the coffeeshop's coffee taste really mediocre!\n\nIf only I could finish off my Bakut Teh with my Akbar Premium Orient Mystery Jasmine Rose tea, that would make the whole experience heavenly wholesome!",

The bowl of curry pork ribs cost $8 with quite generous portion.\n\nHad this curry pork rib and it tasted delicious.  The gravy was fantastic and the ribs were very tendered and soft.  The issue is the flavour was not absorbed into the rib so I believe the ribs were not soaked long enough in the curry sauce.",
