Cynthia Adeline,4,"I have only tried the hotdog buns only. Not sure about the other dishes. I can only say that the buns are my students' favourite. The buns are heated up before serving. You can top it off with   chilli, ketchup or mustard that are placed at the side of the counter. Another plus is the price. $1.50 For a hotdog bun. Inexpensive yummy snack.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117477837348344667984/reviews
Calvin Foo,1,Would not recommend. Order 2 curry chicken with rice and worst ever curry chicken I've tried. Chicken pieces very little and a lot of potatoes. The garlic bread side dish was the best dish! Also tried the spicy seafood steamboat and the soup was like water with a bit of spicy cube...,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102339338922254571419/reviews
Muhd Hayyun Azhar,1,Food here is bad to okay depending on what you eat. I ordered the chicken chop and getting the Egg yolk sauce was a huge mistake. It didn't even tasted like egg. The chicken was okay. My mother order the oyster noodle soup. The soup was literally a strong soy sauce based soup. Would probably not come back here again,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117175777609777184125/reviews
