      "text": "Ordered the $8 portion as the $5 portion was not enough for me! It‚Äôs too good! Love the slightly wet and thick gravy. It came with 2 different chilli sauce, mix it well with the Hokkien mee and it‚Äôs heavenly! They did give generous amount of pork lard too which goes so well with the hokkien mee. Came during evening time, service is fast and do not need to wait long. It‚Äôs a clean and well maintained hawker center. Highly recommended üëçüèª",

      "text": "Decently delish HKM with Wok Hei\n\nThe wok hei was the first thing that hit me! Delish actually. But the two types of chilli, the hot&tangy and the spicy sambal didn't really worked for me. After I mixed it up, the spices masked the wok hei and reduced the appeal of the dish for me. Though I must say the fresh and generous serving of crispy pork lard makes up for it.\n\n$5 for a small plate is acceptable as it comes with 4 mid sized prawns. A little short on pork belly though, which I prefer more of.\n\nWill go for it if I happen to be in the neighbourhood. Service is quite fast, seeing that's it during a crowded lunch time.",

The prawns and squid are fresh, the broth rich yet not overpowering, and the belacan lends just the right depth of flavour. Portions are generous, and the optional add-ons make it even more satisfying. A must-try for anyone craving classic Singaporean Hokkien Mee",

If you do not take shrimp or squid, you can make it known to the front counter staff and they'll make adjustments accordingly. Overall, a truly yummy and authentic taste of Singapore Fried Hokkien Mee.",

      "text": "As a child, I frequently ate the Fujian Mian from the actual Simon Road coffee shop. My parents were fans and they made me one too.\nThis one doesn‚Äôt taste the same but has a semblance. It‚Äôs still nice though, in the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù context of the dish.\nI had the $8 portion, that came with 5 small prawns and some strips of arrow squid and pork belly, all buried underneath the noodles.\nThey serve two types of sambal to appease both camps, I suppose. But honestly, the traditional accompaniment is the cooked (darker) sambal and not the blended version.\nI only had to wait about 5 minutes. I think the heavy rain was keeping the customers away.\nAnyway, it‚Äôs one that I would have again if I‚Äôm in the area.",
