      "text": "The last time I ate here was Jun 2023. It's Jun 2024 now, and they still only accept cash payments. In an era where cashless options like PayNow, PayLah!, GrabPay, and others are widely available, it's quite inconvenient to not have any of these options. There have been several occasions where I came here without any cash and, unfortunately, couldn't patronize them. I wonder how many customers they miss out on due to this opportunity cost. The lack of modern payment methods might deter many customers who prefer cashless transactions.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered their fried rice couple of times, which unfortunately didn't meet my expectations. The rice was wet and clumpy, lacking the usual fluffiness and separation you'd expect from good fried rice. Additionally, there were only a few pieces of spring onion scattered throughout the dish. Are they rationing spring onions? This made the dish feel sparse and less flavorful than it could be.\n\nOverall, while this branch has potential, there are significant improvements needed both in their payment options and the quality of their dishes.",

      "text": "Update without photo:\nFried rice was still fragrant and nice, but the pork chop now tasted more oily and less tender and also smaller. Quality dropped as probably old uncle was no longer there to do the pork chop.\nPreviously:\nFried rice tasted so right with a little moist and flavourful distribution of sauce, and the non-oily pork chop combined perfectly with the crispy chilli. King indeed!",

      "text": "Tried the mala fried rice with black pepper pork chop. The price is hefty at $7.9 but the portion is also very large. So I think the price is still reasonable.\n\nThe black pepper pork chop is pretty thick and soft inside. Quite good flavour.\n\nThe fried rice is very nice. Full of nice fragrant egg and nice dose of mala. Not overpowering but infused in every grain and taste good.",
