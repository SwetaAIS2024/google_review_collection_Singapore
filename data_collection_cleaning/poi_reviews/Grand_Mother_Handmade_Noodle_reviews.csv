Darren Cheong,3,"Try the soup ban mee and dry ban mee. I would say the dry ban mee is better.

The broth tastes plain a bit disappointing.

There are many ingredients, but the minced meat also tastes plain. The good thing is that it's not frozen minced meat, so it doesn't have that fridge taste. The meat is fresh.

I love the ikan bilis very crunchy and yummy!

Overall, when mixed together, the taste is just okay. The pork oil flavor isn't very strong, maybe.

The price and portion are reasonable.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136407063098297690/reviews
Renee Ong,1,"Although the price is $4.50 for this much and the handmade MHK was good, but the soup is so blend and has weird taste. Maybe next time order dry version. As the waiting time is about 15mins with buzzer.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111880374353850126940/reviews
YY,5,"First time trying this stall having explored many others here at this hawker, and thought this was a great stall that we missed! üòã

üçù tried the dry variant this time around, and both of us thoroughly enjoyed our bowl of noodles! It was clean yet not bland, topped with a generous serving of ingredients and only at $4.50!

Definitely a bowl of comforting noodles to be had, with the queue management being a buzzer system and additional plus since that alleyway is a little crowded at times üëçüèª",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
yvonne L,1,"Egg yolk was so over cooked that I have to return the dish to the stall and ask them to redo the egg. They refused and said I should have told them if I want my egg to be ""undercooked""??? Anyone who eats this dish knows that the egg supposed to be runny. Anyone who cooks eggs knows this is not just an egg that's overcooked, this is a dry and crumbled looking egg yolk that is severely overcooked.

Shame on you for refusal to make good a mistake and try to blame on your customer.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110825747761265385073/reviews
Jacob TAN,3,"Bought mee hoon kueh dry and a ginseng chicken soup back for lunch. The mee hoon kueh has quite a strong taste of garlic but a little bland. Not much ingredients for the noodle and no soup.
The ginseng chicken soup has mild ginseng taste but doesn't have the intensity. The soup is a little mild. The chicken drumstick is soft.
This stall has many other dishes. Although I  am not impressed with these 2 dishes, I will give the other dishes a try the next time I am there.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
