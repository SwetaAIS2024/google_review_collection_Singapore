Staff can be more courteous and serve customer instead of checking his phone, especially if customer is already waiting.\n\n19 May 2023 - Outlet is located in Asia Square Food Garden. There was a small queue but service was still quick and efficient. The Teh C ordered was acceptable.",

If the management of Toast Box see this, I think you should either give them a retraining or put them out of the front line so your customers won’t experience such lousy and rude attitude.",
