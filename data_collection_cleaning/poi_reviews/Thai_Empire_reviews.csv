GoAheadGroupFan,5,"On Wednesday 26 February 2025, I had the shrimp paste fried rice with tom yum soup for my lunch at Koufu food court at Koufu Group Headquarters in Woodlands, and I liked this meal as the shrimp paste fried rice with tom yum soup tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these other Thai dishes (except pork and beef) from this outlet in the future.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105877449322822053371/reviews
