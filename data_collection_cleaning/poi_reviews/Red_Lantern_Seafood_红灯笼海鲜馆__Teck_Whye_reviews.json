Hotplate Tofu: Standard dish, though nice addition of fish and sotong\n3. Garlic Kailan: Allright dish\n4. Gong Bao Chicken Cubes: Although sauce is nice, but the chicken cubes cut into way too small pieces to enjoy, swear there’s more onions than chicken",

One of your female staff rather bigger in size and with some grey hair at the front and golden hair at the back, she was verbally abusing/bullying another younger female staff. She said \"if you can't work properly then go home, don't work\" loudly in front of customers. Yes it's a Friday night which is busy but clearly the younger lady is trying to keep up doing her best. As a senior should provide guidance not verbal bullying, then another older lady who is in charge of bring the food from the kitchen to the counter for the front staff to hand out to customers. It's not the first time orders placed she just placed them at the table outside of kitchen instead of bringing it out to the stainless cabinet next to the counter. The previous team had done a great job serving everyone except this lady who had been here the whole time (the lady who brings food from kitchen to counter)",
