Raymond Kwan,5,"Chanced upon this place while looking for a place to have dinner with my friends. Quality of food is slightly better than Aston and price is competitive too. Will definitely revisit with my wife and daughter to try out their Rosti. I ordered the seafood platter, upgrade to a meal and had their Tiramisu for dessert. the Tiramisu was an 8.5/10 for me.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110703335874051557315/reviews

Nicole Lee,5,"Went there after lunch about 3 pm and the crowd was gone. Ordered a fillet and the sauce is salted egg for a change. It is done perfect and I love the baked potato. There is free coffee or tea before 4pm. In addition, the restaurant does not charge GST! This is awesome! ðŸ¤©",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112922041162594840870/reviews
Sim Simon,4,"Lots of ala carte food choices from the menu (beef, pork, chicken, fish etc) as well as their sets (with soup, bread and hot drink).
All delicious and at pocket-friendly prices!
Rather noisy though, especially during peak hours.
Seating arrangement was comfortable enough.
Staff were helpful and efficient.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115942688592554491924/reviews
