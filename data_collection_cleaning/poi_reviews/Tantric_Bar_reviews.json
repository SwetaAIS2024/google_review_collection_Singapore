The drink menu has a wide variety of cocktails - from sweet and fun to serious mixes - to numerous varieties of shots. Handsome hard-working staff take time to be friendly with everyone, which is the one reason Tantric remains a local institution. Opens at 5 pm which is the right time for a quiet drink, come after 8 pm to mingle and meet. Reservations suggested for anytime after 7 pm.",
