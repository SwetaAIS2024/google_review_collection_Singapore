      "text": "Think all of us have ordered a burger medium rare only to end up with a well done patty. I'll start off by saying that this is not one of those episodes. Mine came nicely pink on the inside and oozed goodness. Round that off with some nicely cooked bacon and voila, one step closer to burger perfection.\nThe crispy fries were indeed crispy (probably refried) and not over salted. Serving size was ample and the side of salad was simple and refreshing, with a dressing that wasn't over the top.\nIf I had to nitpick, there was maybe just too much truffle flavored mayo, which can often overpower everything else, including the meat. Again, that would be quibbling over what would be a very competently done streaky bacon burger. Blur ?! No. Not at all... 4.5 stars!\n\nPS. Service was great too !",

      "text": "Walked in to the restaurant on Thursday night at 9 pm. There was another table of about 6 people finishing their meal. While waiting for our orders to be prepared, I asked if they closed at 10 pm and they said only Friday to Sunday. We appreciated that they didn't turn us away. We were delighted to see the large portions sent to our table and were wowed by the quality of the meals. The burger was a nice medium rare with lots of fries while the roast chicken salad was just amazing. Total bill was SGD49, which is a fair price (just don't convert to MYR, die).",

The burger was pretty good patty was medium pinkish. Fries was also very crispy. Not the best burger I've had but nice cozy vibes and price is reasonable.",

      "text": "I had the Signature Burger at 2 Blur Guys, and it did not disappoint! The patty was juicy and flavorful, paired perfectly with a soft bun and just the right amount of sauce. Everything came together really well, making for a satisfying and well-balanced burger.\n\nThe quality of ingredients was evident, and the portion was just right. The place has a nice, casual vibe, and the service was friendly too. Definitely a spot worth checking out if you’re craving a good burger!",

      "text": "Best burger in Singapore????? 3 letters. NAH. For the quality and taste the price tag for 20 dollars plus is totally not worth it. 2 blur guys completely blur to their beef burgers.\n\nThe truffle egg burger gets a flat 6.5/10 nowhere close to meadesmoore. There was so much mayo. The party was cooked perfectly but the taste was not as beefy as I wanted and it wasn’t that juicy. Some more it’s in their recommended and the amount of people so little. The quality control is atrocious.\n\nThe fries were not nice. It tasted weird and I don’t taste any truffle. 5.5/10\n\nService nothing to brag about just doing their job.\n\nOverall not worth coming here it’s SUPER DISAPPOINTING.",
