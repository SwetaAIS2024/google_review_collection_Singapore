Martin,5,"The staff is really helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Especially Reiven and Chris both helped us tremendously with transport information to Malaysia.
We liked the Geylang district, it's a vibrant and authentic neighbourhood with many affordable restaurants. The bus stop is only one minute away, the MRT 12 minutes.
Our double room was great value for S$90.
The only downside are thin walls to the floor, some customers were noisy in one night, but that's not the hotels fault. The electric systems were humming a bit, but nothing to be bothered about.
We definitely recommend it.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101706784031857979017/reviews
devi putri,5,"I was quite satisfied with this hotel. The room was not very spacious, but it was clean. The staff handling check-in was very friendly and informative. The location is convenient, close to a mini market and several dining options within walking distance. The bus stop is also fairly close to the hotel.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113750980456899758240/reviews
Elizabeth F,5,"It‚Äôs a good budget hotel.
Stayed for 3 nights. The check in process was fast & easy. The room‚Äôs decent, the bed pretty comfy, there‚Äôs even a hair dryer inside the drawer, there are water bottles, coffee & tea, water kettle provided in room, and also the bathroom has water heater.

Another plus point is there‚Äôs bus stop not too far from the hotel, just 2-3 minutes walk. There are many small stores to buy your necessities, snacks, water, etc, and restaurant that open ‚Äòtill night.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102102685458175743202/reviews
"Gennelle Faye Valensoy, PTRP",5,"Rooms: Clean and comfy.
Staff: Accommodating & friendly
Location: Not all buses pass by the bus station near the hotel. The MRT is a bit far, about a 10- to 15-minute walk away.

If you're traveling with a group (3-4 persons) just use grab instead ‚ó°Ãà

I loooove this hotel! 10/10 would recommend. Smells gooood with AC in their hallway. Bathroom is clean with heater!! ü§©üòç

They even allowed us to check-in early. There's also a blower, water heater, drinking water from the tap, coffee, and tea.

Worth it!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116144034792815935715/reviews
Deh Vil,5,"No frills, budget hotel - perfect for S, S, S!!!

We moved from a 5 star hotel in the CBD to this property and was skeptical at first.

To our surprise, it is a clean, no frills budget hotel. If all you need is the 3 S‚Äôs, then this is a place to be. Clean rooms, sheets, towels and comfortable accommodations. Awesome water pressure from shower and awesome AC.

We were in Room 309, and yes, it is a wet shower, but the floor is well sloped that the entire bathroom does not get wet, if use the shower curtain properly.

Only has body wash (no conditioner and lotion) and instant coffee/tea I think.

No bedside plug ins, so consider bringing an extension cord, though there are 3-4 plugs in the room.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101193464114934659229/reviews
