      "text": "I recently visited Nomad Soirée  for mother's day with my mother and was absolutely delighted! Their grazing platter is a standout — beautifully presented, with a thoughtful selection of cheeses, cured meats, fruits, and artisanal accompaniments. The quality and freshness of the ingredients were top-notch, and it’s clear a lot of care goes into curating each board. The ambience of the cafe is cosy and inviting, making it a perfect spot to relax with friends or enjoy a quiet bite. Highly recommend for anyone who appreciates great food and a charming atmosphere!",

      "text": "I recently had the pleasure of grazing at Nomad's Soirée, and I have to say, I’m hooked! Their grazing boxes are a game-changer for any gathering. I ordered the \"Gather & Graze\" box for a small get-together, and the presentation alone was jaw-dropping. It felt like a work of art, with a perfect mix of savory and sweet treats that catered to every taste.\n\nThe flavors were incredible—everything tasted so fresh and high-quality. I loved that they offered something unique and special, like the \"Camembert of Hearts,\" which was as delicious as it was beautiful. The service was equally impressive. They made the entire process easy and fun, from the ordering to the delivery. I can tell they really care about providing a top-notch experience.\n\nAnd then the Arabica coffee!\n\nNomad's Soirée, located at The Brooks 1, 60 Springside Walk #01-09, Singapore 786020,\n\nOperating hours are Tuesday to Thursday from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM, Friday and Saturday from 10:00 AM to 9:00 PM, and Sunday from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM",

      "text": "Got to know Nomad’s Soirée during Covid when I gifted graze boxes to friends. Found out that they have a physical store now and during the month of Ramadan they have a few items for takeaway and no sit in. Bought the hummus with pita bread, graze box and banana bread. They were all very delicious. The pomegranate on the hummus was a nice touch and I like that it’s not oily. The graze box is very generous. And the banana bread is tastily packed with walnut and not overly sweet. Now I regret not getting the tomato soup which I’m sure will be very tasty too. Can’t wait to try their food again.",
