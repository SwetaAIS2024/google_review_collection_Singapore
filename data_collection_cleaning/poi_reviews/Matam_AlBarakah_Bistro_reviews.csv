Zaheem ahamed,5,"Mat’am Al Barakah offers an exceptional experience from the moment you walk in. The atmosphere is elegant and peaceful, perfect for both special occasions and quiet dinners. The food was beautifully presented and full of flavor—every dish showed attention to detail and quality.

The highlight of our visit was their special zurbiya rice—perfectly cooked, fragrant, and packed with flavor. We also loved the tandoori chai, which was served piping hot with a smoky, rich taste. It’s a must-try for tea lovers!

The service was outstanding: polite, attentive, and always professional. The staff truly made us feel welcome and valued.

If you’re looking for a fine dining restaurant that delivers both luxury and warmth, Mat’am Al Barakah is the place to go.
Highly recommended—we’ll definitely be coming back!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109856541170483344029/reviews
