Ray Tan,5,"One of the few places with an electronic waste bin at B1, near the escalator. It’s for light electronic equipments only. Dualengkong equipments wouldn’t be able to fit in the bin.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118226053308108066808/reviews
Skincare by Sophia,4,"Siglap Centre is not a big mall, but good enough amenities for nearby East Coast and Siglap residents to run their errands, visit their family doctors, get hairs cut and beauty up.. The empty car park in B2 makes it very convenient for shoppers and mall users.

I have just opened my facial skincare spa in B1 and have been keeping busy thanks to all the residents' support.

Yusuf Zulfi,5,"🍟The McDonald's is fancy and comfortable. Great place to dine in. Modern and sleek. A McSpicy meal combined with Coke Zero is will freshen up your day just right.

🥪 Subway is small but great place to hangout with friends. Very clean and homelike. Food is healthy and refreshing. The sandwhiches are so tasty! ☺️

🌻🌸 The floral shop has a variety of flowers from roses, to sunflowers to tulips. The place itself is centred right at the heart of Siglap Centre so it's easy to notice. Bought my mom's bday gift here.

Siglap Centre is a classic of Siglap. Been visiting this place since I was young. Amazing place to hangout and chill !!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115703775125378212966/reviews
