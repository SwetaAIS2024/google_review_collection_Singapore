Paul Yang,4,"Great for the price.  They cleaned room and changed towels each day.  Room has a small refrigerator.  There’s a second faucet for drinking water.  However, they only give you one keycard.

Note that the room is pretty small, need to step into the shower to close the bathroom door.  Ac stayed very cold the first night, and you can’t really adjust the temperature.

Area has a lot of Indian-Muslim, Chinese restaurants nearby.  Good grocery stores.  About 5-10 min walk from mrt stations.  It’s in the red light district but it seems pretty safe, at least for a guy.

I went to the nearby grocery stores to buy a fresh coconuts for $2.  Great coconut water.  In the morning I went to the Indian restaurants to get breakfast.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116017985804040890990/reviews
Sophia Pugh,4,"So long as you are expecting a pleasant room from a budget hotel, this really fits the bill. Obviously the neighbourhood may not be suitable for some but we found it very easy to explore the rest of the city using the public transport which is very accessible. In short it does what it says on the tin.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104253929090538418517/reviews

Dian Juliana,3,"Its a budget hotel, I knew. I need to maintain my expectations on this.
First, the room is nice, not too small. But the floor is so dirty. I mean, there’s lot of dust on my feet when I step the floor. And the bed is pretty hard lol idk why. It feels like therapy bed (?). Thank god it’s still a sleep able bed.
PLUS point, its near the bus stops. And the staffs are nice.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108669095803145087467/reviews
