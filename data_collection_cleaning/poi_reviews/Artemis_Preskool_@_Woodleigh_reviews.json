      "text": "Artemis Preskool at Woodleigh is a good childcare with many smart kids, trained by passionate and patient teachers. I can feel a very good progress on my son since he started the PN class there.\nThe principal, Mrs. Carol, is a very capable lady who handles and tackles things very efficiently. She tries to solve problems as soon as possible and thinks of the best way to do so. üëç\nThere are many pretty teachers there too üíï\nOn the 18 Nov 2023, Artemis held a graduation ceremony üë®‚Äçüéì for the K2 students at SingPost Centre.\nStudents from N2-K2 participated in performing together. I was surprised and delighted to see my K1 son perform so well. He had never shown me the dance movements at home before. I will definitely signed him up again to participate for the next year graduation celebration.\nThe ceremony went well, and the teachers are actively taking care of the students.\n\nMy daughter just started to join the school last month. Because my son was there, my daughter didn't feel unfamiliar. She is adjusting well after the first month of crying and adapting, haha üòÑ.\n\nThere's a weekly report from the English and Chinese teachers on their progress and what they have learned.\nEvery month, there will be an update on the curriculum for that month.\nEvery semester, there is a parent-teacher meeting.\n\nOverall, I'm happy to send my son and daughter to Artemis Preskool at Woodleigh.",
