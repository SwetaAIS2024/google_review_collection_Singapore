Jameson Soh,5,Beautiful food. Came here for dim sum and thoroughly enjoyed it. The price is quite high but the quality is also amazing. You get value for your money.  On top of all that if you yous Kris+ you get 9miles per dollar! Super good value.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114638474903750139514/reviews
Jialeng Lee,4,"For our company lunch during Lunar New Year, the food was decent overall. My favorite was the roasted chicken, though there wasn’t much of a truffle flavor. The desserts were a real highlight, and I absolutely loved them! The service and environment were both decent as well, making it a nice meal to celebrate.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106651375996354389379/reviews
Yingying S,3,"Had lunch at 1.15pm on 12 May, Vesak Day and Peking duck was already unavailable. It’s a public holiday and I’m shocked the restaurant ran out of Peking duck one hour into lunch service. The place was only half full.

Management declined the use of my $20 voucher for my $234 bill although it was not stated in the T&Cs that it can’t be used on a PH. Seems like they just decided on a whim to decline it without proper protocols on its usage, as they didn’t provide any other explanation aside from “today is a special occasion”.

Overall standard of food seems to have dropped from what I remember (last visit here was 2 years ago).

The good - service staff are helpful and attentive in recommending dishes. Ambience is nice and elegant. My favourite dish was the eggplant & long beans.

Overall it was still a disappointing experience though and I won’t be returning, will also no longer recommend this restaurant for Chinese food given the others that have popped up recently.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116567843907418256174/reviews
