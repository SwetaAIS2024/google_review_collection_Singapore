      "text": "I've been seeing Sherin for close to a year after experiencing the biggest trauma in my life so far. I don't think I would be nearly as balanced, as forgiving, or as positive about life today if it wasn't for her. Her relaxed yet still assured demeanor made it easy for me to communicate with her from the first session. It's still a journey but at times I've been surprised by the progress made (as someone who is new to therapy). I'm actually excited to work on myself more with her guidance and expertise. Even though this has been the hardest year of my life, Sherin is a huge reason I feel like I'm still standing on my feet. So so grateful to have found her ",

Her bright colourful persona is warm and welcoming . With time childhood , troubles , patterns become an easy jigsaw puzzle to solve as she lays it all down with so much clarity . I have gone through some of the hardest times in my life with my head high because that is what I learnt through our sessions . I learnt to believe in myself . I found a friend , guardian and an extremely skilled professional in her . I am forever grateful and I will not forget the work I’ve done with her for life .",
