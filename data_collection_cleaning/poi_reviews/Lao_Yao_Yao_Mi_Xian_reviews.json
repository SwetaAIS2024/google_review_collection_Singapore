      "text": "Ordered mala xiang guo 麻辣香锅from the same shop. Total was $18 mostly vegetables and mushrooms and some slices of beef\n\nIt took about 10 to 15 minutes to prepare and it was not hot. It was lukewarm at best. And mind you, i ate it immediately after it arrived because i was so hungry. How can you serve food that is not hot? So i requested to refry it because it was not hot. Lady at the counter was judgy probably the first time she has heard this??\n\nAnd once again, to my amazement and the chef’s professional skills, it was still lukewarm??? HOW????\n\nConsider this the best way to waste your money. You can eat the mi xian from the next stall but i would 100% stay away from eating mala here\n\nWorst mala i had in my life so far",
