Sharon Carvalho,5,"Heard about the mochi waffles here so we just had to give it a try. It IS GOOD, so good. The kinder bueno flavoured ice cream and the milk and honey ice cream were so delish, not too sweet. Service was great. Definitely heading back as these mochi bombs are seasonal.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107074008321949084427/reviews

d. alysh,5,"There’s a been hype for mochi waffles going around & after deciding on which cafe try it at, we ended up at Scoopy Doo.

We drove down around 3pm & it was really quiet and empty but upon arriving, we were surprised to see that they had 20% off ALL menu items (tea time promo) from 1pm-5pm during weekdays!

We had the mochi waffles (apparently its a seasonal waffle flavour = add $1) with 2 scoops of ice cream (kinder bueno and milk & honey).
Total damage was $15.40 (aft 20% off). Portion was just nice to share with one other person! Price included a drizzle (maple/chocolate) and a topping (fruity pebbles/oreo/lotus biscuit crumbs) of your choice.

Waffle was crispy and had just enough mochi inside which didn’t leave us feeling jelak & allowed us to finish the entire dessert!

Kinder bueno ice cream quite literally tastes like kinder bueno (amazing???) and the Milk & Honey was simple yet sooooooo good especially together with the crispy waffles!!!

Staff was kind, friendly & all smiles which made our dining experience pleasant on top of the dessert!

They’re located next to Bedok reservoir. Literally the first building on the left of bedok reservoir from the main road.

Shop is also very conveniently located 2-3 mins walk from bus stop & directly beside a multi-storey carpark! (shown in one of the pictures)

This is definitely a hidden gem. We left with no regrets and will be back for more in future :)",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106340998127798371121/reviews

John Koh,5,My second visit to this small cafe hidden away with partial view of Bedok Reservoir. Serve up a mean Waffle and variety of ice cream. The staff is friendly and gladly spoon out sample of ice cream upon request. Single scoopy cost $4.90 and it’s worth every cent. Came during  Sunday afternoon to chillax to beat the noon heat.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103447327229500686102/reviews
