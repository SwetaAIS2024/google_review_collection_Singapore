      "text": "I visited the UOB Anson Branch to exchange new banknotes for Chinese New Year, and I had the pleasure of being assisted by Mr. Jeff Chua. He provided exceptional service, explaining in detail how individuals below 60 can withdraw new cash and guiding me through the process of resolving interbank transfer issues between DBS and OCBC.\n\nNot only did he clarify everything clearly, but he also took the time to analyze the transfer issue I was facing and offered practical solutions. His thorough explanations and genuine care were truly commendable. Itâ€™s rare to encounter someone as attentive, professional, and knowledgeable as him, and I sincerely appreciate the effort he put into helping me.\n\nWishing Mr. Jeff Chua a joyous and prosperous Chinese New Year!",

      "text": "Poor service rendered by Joy Loh serving at Privilege counter 2 on 29 Dec 2022. Incompetent and unfriendly. Was there for a simple transaction - to apply for Treasury Bills using CPFOA. Even if I were a not Privilege Banking customer, I would have expected her to fill in the simple form for me, like my name, address. She even wanted me to fill in my CPFIS account number, which is on her screen right in front of her! Without asking me for my investment preference, she instructed me to cancel out competitive bid option.  Joy needs more coaching and training before being put at the counter to serve Privilege Banking customers. She lacks basic knowledge.",

Was served within half an hour after receiving my number. The staff were all very courteous and friendly throughout my entire experience. They always made sure to check if I was clear or if I had any outstanding questions. Special shoutout to the guy who helped me open my account. I didn't catch his name but we were in Rm 8 on 8th December. Would come back to this branch specifically next time :)",
