Joy See,5,"Excellent customer service from service staff Ms Cheng Mei Sien.   When I told her the noodle was very peppery (which is their noodle speciality) she had offered me a glass of water.  For my birthday month, i was given  a 20% discount off the non promo set.  She even requested a free dessert, which was expied from my membership. The food was fantastic, and I did not regret returning back again.  Please keep up this improved standard since COVID time.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114783878646907797614/reviews
Isabelle Tay,5,Came here for their lunch set. Loved the prawn dumplings as it was fully stuffed with prawns. It also came with side dishes which was not bad. Service was good despite being crowded.
