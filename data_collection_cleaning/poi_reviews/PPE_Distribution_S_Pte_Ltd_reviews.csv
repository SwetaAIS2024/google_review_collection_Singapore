Kogulan Sunderam,5,"I visited PPE Distribution yesterday, to buy safety boots as I was eyeing one and they had it. The place was clean and was greeted by almost everyone. I was attended by James, a young and friendly chap. The overall experience was great, good value for money and got a free gift.

I really recommend this place to everyone if you’re getting your safety gears.

Their unit is located on the 3rd floor of Block 9004. Take the lift and turn right and right again to reach the unit, you wouldn’t miss it when you take the right as there’ll be a signboard at the very end.

Thank you very much PPE Distribution for the warm welcome and assistance.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108585381779887018311/reviews
Wesley,5,"Very satisfied with their service.
Sadly can't say the same for the catapillar boot that I had brought from them. Can't believe how far the catapillar has fallen in their quality... Luckily the salesman and women are very understanding and exchanged another boot model with no question.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100624931181203329935/reviews
