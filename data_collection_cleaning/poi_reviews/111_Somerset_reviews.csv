Jax Tan,5,"The new Hvala has just reopened! Different vibes now! Feels energetic, bright and cheerful. They have also updated their menu! I had the matcha strawberry and itâ€™s really good, much better than the other one I had at another place.

Also the matcha petite cake just looks so good. Iâ€™m usually not a huge fan of cakes and desserts as I find most of them being too sweet. But Hvala nailed the proportion perfectly and you canâ€™t stop eating bite after bite. Definitely must come and try if you are around the area.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101394747189546537795/reviews
Di Di,5,"There is Fairprice Finest here and many affordable dining places here. It is rather quiet and not so crowded, which I appreciate.

Nandhakumar Ganesan,5,The mutton and chicken were both delicious and authentic. The rice was slightly over done but the meat was very soft and very well cooked.

Great wine, great food ðŸ˜Š both of us had the set which included a wine together with a bowl of mussels and a mains (we got the crispy pork knuckles).  Nothing to nitpick really.
