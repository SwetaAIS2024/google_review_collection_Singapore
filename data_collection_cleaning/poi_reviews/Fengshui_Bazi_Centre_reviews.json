      "text": "Just wrapped up Master Andrew’s two-day basic feng shui class, and wow—talk about a knowledge-packed session! Despite the short duration, the amount of info shared was both massive and super insightful. Master Andrew’s teaching style? He’s patient, thorough, and always ready to answer every question, no matter how many we throw his way. Plus, his sense of humor kept things fun and far from boring. If you’re thinking about diving into feng shui, this is the class to start with. Building a strong foundation is crucial, and Master Andrew’s guidance makes it all so much easier. Highly recommend!",
