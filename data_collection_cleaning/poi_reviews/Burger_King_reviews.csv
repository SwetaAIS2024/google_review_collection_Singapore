Kayatori JY,4,"Came to have my lunch at Burger King, and the new Rendang Beef was excellent! The staff were friendly and helpful, although they were short on staff.
Will come back for their new burgers in the future!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100204500550572837000/reviews
Fun Kwok,3,"Small branch which is very much understaffed but they are helpful if you do ask for assistance.
Came by in the am and the child requested for Burger King. We took the breakfast set and the counter staff was very helpful in telling us which one comes with a toy.
From what I observed, the branch does get a number of takeaway/delivery orders. With around 3 staff only, I do see that they are trying their best compared to their competitor with the Golden Arches just a few minutes walk away.
Not exactly a fair fight but I could see the staff are definitely doing their best.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102827686654539049214/reviews
B,1,"Probably my first time in BK in the past decade and sad to say will also probably be my last ever. Service was slow but that wasn’t actually the problem; the food was very sad and disgusting to eat. We spent $20 on 2 set meals but couldn’t even eat half of it because it looked so bad and tasted equally bad that we lost our appetite. The chicken burger patties were pale and tasteless (the picture is supposed to be a juicy mushroom Swiss but you won’t be able to tell), and the fries were cold. Ordered a side of salad for $3 but the cup was only half filled with very basic raw veg. Very very sad about the current state of BK as we used to have fond memories of meals that tasted pretty good when we were younger.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114915407829799123520/reviews
Jason Eng,4,"Food is good especially with coupons deals.
However I find that reception counter aunty not those 玩玩 type, meaning no nonsense type. She comments if things don’t go smoothly. Some may not use to it, but lucky I din clash with her.

She told customers need to wait 40mins for food. Lack of manpower 没办法
BK management to do something to attract & recruit more talent !!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112244911290965003801/reviews
Joanne C.,1,"Would give zero stars if I could. Staff refused to take my order over the counter despite a sign overhead stating “Order here”, saying that they were understaffed, which I can understand. However,  her attitude was also bad and she was really rude. If she had spoken politely I would have accepted it.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114264294934018393676/reviews
