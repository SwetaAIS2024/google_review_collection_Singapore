Vidya Sagar,5,"Since years visiting and had an exceptional experience! The entire staff, particularly Dr. Ho and the nurses, were friendly, helpful, and made me feel at ease.

Dr. Ho took the time to thoroughly examine my thyroid and provided personalized care. Thanks to his expertise, my thyroid levels are now normal! I'm incredibly grateful for his dedication and professionalism.

The clinic's atmosphere was clean, organized, and welcoming. The staff were attentive, efficient, and made sure I understood my treatment plan.

I highly recommend this clinic to anyone seeking top-notch healthcare. Dr. Ho and his team truly care about their patients' well-being, and it shows!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105309478287684183399/reviews

tay ck,5,"Dr choong. Is a meticulous doctor. Both visit i was the last patient at closing time. He didnt rush. He check, ask questions and took time to diagnose. On my follow up visit on 29 Nov night. He told me to go to A&E as he suspected my cough had became Pneumonia and he was correct. He told me if i was to visit the clinic in day time they could also send me to x ray but i went there at clinic closing time so i had to go to A&E.

Last but not least both nurses at the counter are very patient, speak without rush, explain the medication to patients clearly and with a smile.

I would return to this clinic if i am sick again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111078467788532506870/reviews
