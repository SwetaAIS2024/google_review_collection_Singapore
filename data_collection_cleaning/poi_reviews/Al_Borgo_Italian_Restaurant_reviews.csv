han yao,5,"Hands down, some of the best food I’ve had recently! The freshness of the ingredients and the unique flavors in the Fritto Misto were unforgettable. Highly recommended for food enthusiasts!”

And it was already listed into my little princess *Most Delicious Food listing* , and now is was the champion. However, she used to change her mind frequently and quickly, but anyhow now it was the champion which is what i strongly agreed with her.

The service is really great and the restaurant is very clean and hygienic. And they do provide kids tableware which are suitable for children's small hands which i think it made extra points as not much restaurant actually provide currently.

Overall experience is excellent! I will definitely come again and again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101424258779334785957/reviews
coco r,5,Gem in the neighbourhood. Tasty authentic Italian cuisine. Thin crusted Pizzas like in Italy. The seafood pasta in the bag is a must try. A simple place with cosy atmosphere. The team are always warm and friendly especially Mr Daniel always checking in taking good care of us. We keep going back.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109900533289837472823/reviews
Sheng,4,"Went for dinner not too long ago. The food was pretty decent. Particularly liked the lamb. It was tender, flavourful, and had a good char. Paired well with the chianti. Calamari batter could have been crispier. Pizza was alright. Toppings were good. Dough was soft, but overall structure leaned a little towards a pita. Truffle cheese wheel carbonara was cheesy and rich. Truffle Sage butter ravioli sauce was aromatic and nicely emulsified, but the pasta filling fell slightly short. Limoncello sponge with pistachio ice cream dessert was a great way to end the meal. The service was friendly and hospitable, but the place was full towards the rush hour, so some patience is needed. Limoncello house digestives were very much appreciated. Prices are on the higher end, but the quality-price ratio is still ok if you factor in location and overall experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106087228995573038993/reviews

GL,4,"Went for the cheese wheel pasta, but it wasn’t available on Wednesday. Atmosphere and service were pretty good and we enjoyed the boat pizza.

Kobe pasta and Capellini truffle were okay but I guess the cheese wheel pasta might be better.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112972962494157503604/reviews
