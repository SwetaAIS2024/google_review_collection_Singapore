Very professional and efficient team, manage to finish the installation before schedule, they even took time to check on the condition of my vehicle. Highly recommended!",

      "text": "The customer service is shockingly horrible. Please don’t be scammed by the other 5 star reviews you see. The “lady boss” named Yvonne has no basic respect and will treat you worse than a dog. She spoke to us with attitude and shouted at us even when it is a simple query. This was not the first time.\n\nI am aghast that the BOSS of Jackspeed Automobile has such foul and horrible attitude. My family and I will definitely not go to Jackspeed Automobile again and neither should any of you. There are so many automobile shops out there. It’s not worth being yelled at as a customer for no reason here.\n\nHighly do not recommend.",

However the waiting time to get the Job done even with my appt was at 8.30am. They only managed to start work at 10.03am. Do go to their workshop if you can afford to wait. The Japanese and Korean Car's are much easier to i stall FYI. Thanks Ah Seng and Jack Speed. You have a Great Mechanic here.",
