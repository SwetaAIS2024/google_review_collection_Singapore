Laabi Cook,4,"Always here for the mala xiang guo and tze char (rice or noodles only), Hokkien mee and indian muslim.

Quality of mala xiang guo changes depending on the time you visit. It's not that good during high peak hours.

I recommend the grilled fish too, it's enough for 4 person if you're having it with rice.

-----

I always order the masala thosai or indian rojak at the indian muslim stall.

-----

Ah yes, char siew rice, wanton mee and curry chicken noodle can be a good option.

-----

Taiwan stall a little disappointing and overpriced.
Enoki mushrooms has this woody smell, plus it was very oily, so it was just oozing with this woody + oil with every bite.

The salted chicken, just boiled chicken apparently with veggies of your choice. Tastes alright but nothing amazing. It's more expensive than having mala xiang guo though, probably because this has more meat.

All in all. I've had better Taiwanese food in SG but just not this place. I cook better lu rou fan too... so...

Western food will be good for those who like thickly battered and breaded items, which you can hardly taste item inside. Sorry, this is not for me.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110714697793887360400/reviews
TCH,5,"Good place to have a good meal in this coffeeshop here in Punggol.  I particularly tasted and like these 2 stalls: the Mee Goreng is very consistently good taste.

This Chinese Malaysia stall took over the precious Thai Food stall.  I tried the 刀削面 and liked it.  The broth is not oily and salty, the taste is delicious for $5 Beef noodles!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467592239988127131/reviews
Jonathan SM,2,"Dried chilli chicken, salted egg chicken, asam fish and hot plate beancurd the food taste can be better and abit pricy. It's not worth it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100657913539027904943/reviews
DDT,2,"Decent food options here with average edible food but hard to stomach food prices. Decent amount of seats but seats indoors can get really hot and stuffy.

For some reason the coffeeshops at punggol have predatory crazy prices for both food and drinks. The drink stall here has raised prices to obscene levels, and this ice teh c is already $2.30. They don't even bother to give a full cup despite already being 75% ice. Do yourself a favor and get a cheaper drink elsewhere or from the supermarket next door.

Food options as of writing includes hokkien mee, Mala xiangguo,  mince pork noodles and fish soup, chicken rice, economy mix rice and the char stall. I'd recommend the hokkien mee (despite its price) - its the local MP's go to meal as well when she's in the area for visits.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115615882001906823409/reviews
theguy_withstuff,4,"While the environment is less then appealing, the food there has a good taste, I ate the “Shredded Chicken Hor Fun” from the Chicken Rice store and it was great honestly, underrated for a dish. It will definitely enrich your TasteBud.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112628164904019834073/reviews
