      "text": "Finding a parking spot can be a challenge at first, but once you arrive at this expansive playing field, it's well worth the effort. The wide-open, grass-carpeted flying zone under a clear sky makes for an incredible FPV experience. Even after a crash, our drone sustained little to no damage, thanks to the soft landing surface.\n\nThe hut provides ample shade, making it a comfortable spot to operate from. Once you're done flying, you can head back to the Create Tower area, where eateries remain open even on weekends.\n\nFor those driving, you can park at the NUS Create Tower car park and follow the designated path. Thereâ€™s a gate in the fenced-up area that appears to be open at all times. The walk from the car park to the southern end of the flying zone took me about seven minutes. Refer to my map for the locations.",

And if you are lugging your equipment backpack you will be all sweaty by the time you get there.\nThe place is hilly and does not have much amenities other than a few tables. There are huts around but again they are another few minutes hike away.\nNothing very scenic here if you want to take pictures. This place is more for those who want to practice moves or stunts. Fixed wings, helicopters, FPV. Camera drone pilots will be disappointed.",
