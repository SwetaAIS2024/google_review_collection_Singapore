It currently features only photos and prices, lacking the crucial dish names.\nThe friendly waitress offered a coupon for a free iced lemon tea, which was a nice touch.\nThere's no GST or service charge, which is a plus.\nThe food itself is simple, consisting mainly of meat patties, rice, and lettuce. The free iced lemon tea made the meal worthwhile.\"",

      "text": "5 Stars - A Hidden Gem in Novena!\nHighly recommend trying the curry hamburger meat don â€” absolutely fantastic! The patty is perfectly fried, juicy on the inside, and drenched in rich, flavorful curry sauce that ties the whole dish together beautifully. The rice was fluffy, and the fresh lettuce and shredded cabbage added a nice crunch. Chef Lester is warm, welcoming, and clearly passionate about his food. A cozy spot with heart, flavor, and amazing hospitality. Will definitely be back!",
