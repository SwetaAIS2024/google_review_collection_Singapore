Lau Guan Zhen (Sean),5,"Ah Er Soup is the go-to spot for comforting, delicious Chinese herbal soups. The soups are flavorful, nourishing, and packed with quality ingredients. Favorites like the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall and Lotus Root Soup are a must-try. The portions are generous, and the prices are reasonable. Perfect for a healthy and hearty meal!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111510773764729640794/reviews
Debby Pauline Sim,3,"Came to try the Buddha Jump Over The Wall soup since it is the stall's speciality but i am disappointed. The soup is super salty and nothing like what the photos look like. Furthermore, the stall only accepts CASH and we had to walk opp to withdraw cash instead. Not coming again.....",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114983023723203317267/reviews

Justin Cheang,5,"Love their braised pork trotter very much, tender, juicy and huge portion of meat. Its very generous portion at $7, i cooked pork trotter before so I knew the cost is almost the same or higher , not to mentioned the time needed.

Bought 5 recently to each family members.

Highly recommend their black chicken soup, watercress pork rib soup too.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105933835519895080607/reviews
