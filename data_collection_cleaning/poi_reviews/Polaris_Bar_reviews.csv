Darren Tee,5,"The restaurant had a delightful ambiance, substantially enhanced by the live violin and piano performance. All the dishes we ordered, from the fried halibut and steak to the lamb shank and foie gras, were not only delicious but also beautifully presented. However, one area that could use improvement was the soft-spoken waitress who made it really difficult for us to hear her. Her introduction to the menu using a tiny iPad, while holding it in her hand, felt awkward and made it really difficult for us to see the menu and hear her properly. It would have been so much better if she had introduced the menu while we were holding the menu ourselves, allowing us to fully understand and appreciate her explanations. So, don’t need to whisper lah. The other waiters at the same restaurant were speaking loud and clear.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115655820970396643750/reviews
May Liao,4,"It gave us a bad experience when we come in. I heard that it is a very famous restaurant and the environment is also very good. However, there is no enough food on the spot. I really hope they can improve their short.

After finish our dishes, they apologized to us and gave us some free snacks and drinks. So far so good, their service is good.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105472617454378871769/reviews
Carol Pua,5,"Exquisite interior. Offer a variety of alcohol and mocktails.  The salmon bites entrée is the best! Carbonara truffle pasta is not too creamy, just nice. The dessert pink heaven has a mousse texture, do not fancy this, probably because I am not a dessert person.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114584911302165692699/reviews
