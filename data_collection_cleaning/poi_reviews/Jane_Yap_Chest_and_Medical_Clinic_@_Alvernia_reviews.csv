Edy Ng,1,"I went to clinic, to see the doctor with my wife to treat coughing. My wife cant interfere , cant ask anything , and cant stand beside me while the  doctor examined me.
Doctor also didnt  give me any Conclusion at the end about what exactly happened to me. This is the worst doctor  I have ever been in Singapore. No suggestion on how to prevent cough , how to reduce cough , etc.  Seems like the docter lazy to explain anything to us .

pautkaya 40,1,"I consulted with her about my cough taking long after Covid last year 2021. She was not patient with me at all even for taking notes about my medical history. When she was listening to my lung and I keep coughing, she didn’t like it and told me to control. Of course I can’t control my coughing especially when I breath deep in and that’s the reason I came to see her. The worst thing is that she didn’t answer my questions with patient and good attitude. I find her very rude as a doctor to her patient. Won’t be ever coming back again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110899493461201464913/reviews
nigel giam,5,Caring & detailed doctor. Went to many GPs to receive treatment for persistent cough but only resolved under Dr Yap’s care. Highly recommended as she pays attention to every detail to address my condition. Very reassuring and comforting in her consultations.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109655110196509389663/reviews
Guo Hong Lim,5,"Got to know of Dr Yap through a friend. Dr Yap has since become my go-to-doctor for any respiratory conditions & family consultations. She is kind, patient and very helpful given the many years of her experience.

Very motherly figure, even offered medicine for my hiking adventures!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105952383368898400897/reviews
