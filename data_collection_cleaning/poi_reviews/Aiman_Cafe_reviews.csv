syasya nurhaziqah,5,"very surprised by their sambal fried rice. i was having a hard time deciding whether i should get a sweet and sour fish bento with egg fried rice or sambal fried rice when ordering and the super helpful Faizul broke down the taste profile for me and safe to say his recommendation was really good! all my family members liked the combination. please look for Faizul if you’re having a hard time deciding what to get. he made the best recommendation! 10/10 no notes. ps i didnt get to take a picture of the food bc everyone dug in so thats all u get, sorry if it looks messy but thats when you know the food is gooood",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117035162528817545156/reviews
