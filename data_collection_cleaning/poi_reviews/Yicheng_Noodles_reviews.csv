Wilson Foo,4,"Not sure why this new stall at Clementi West Street 2 is called Yicheng Noodles because itâ€™s a cai png stall.

Variety is limited but portion is large. Steamed egg, sesame oil chicken and tofu  with rice cost $4.00. Not exactly cheap. Taste wise, chicken had a strong unwashed smell and very little sesame oil taste. Tofu and steamed egg were acceptable.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263857328212431619/reviews
