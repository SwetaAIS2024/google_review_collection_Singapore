Was a thick cut of fish with a very light crispy batter.\n\nOnly downside to this place is that its not a fully air-conditioned place, but its well ventilated with tons of fans around. You get alfresco dining and enjoy nature and people watching.",

I brought my 2 furkids here while dinning but last few days was here with a customer for lunch.  The Pepperoni Pizza is superb and the Buttermilk Chicken and Pancakes is delicious too.  I am not so much of a beer person but the Golden Ale is smooth and easy to drink.  Sitting outdoor will be recommended as it is quite breezy and there are many ceiling fans installed. Will come back to try other dishes and pizzas soon, food selection is quite good as well as the beer selection.",

I specifically found the kids' meal to be not worth ordering; it was underwhelming and definitely not worth the wait. Speaking of wait, we ended up waiting an hour for our food to be served, which is far too long for a casual dining experience. Overall, I was left frustrated and won't be returning anytime soon.",

The food we ordered Sausage Platter & hot wings were really good. And the new beer selection the have is really good, better than the last. Well done Mitch ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",
