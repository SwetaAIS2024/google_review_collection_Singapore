Momo Ng Pei yee,5,"The tailor is incredibly patient and always takes the time to listen carefully to every request. Their craftsmanship is outstanding‚Äîevery piece is executed with precision and perfection. I‚Äôm always impressed by the attention to detail and the consistent quality of their work.

Miyoko Yee,2,"Despite the good reviews I‚Äôve seen here, my experience has been nothing short of disappointing. Went to get my top‚Äôs strap fix but was underwhelmed by the quality of sewing. Thread was not of the same colour as the top, they did not cut off the loose threads and it was not sewed straight. With such skills, I could have sewed it myself‚Ä¶ last picture was the other side‚Äôs original sewing pattern that they could have referenced from.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104583059476739046657/reviews
Saleha Jubir,5,"I had such a pleasant experience with them when altering my wedding dress and tea ceremony dress. Highly recommended and trust worthy. They are very meticulous and did an amazing job with the alternation.

I also got my dresses and other items dry cleaned. It was pressed down really nicely and as fresh as they could be! They keep up to their word and true to the timing promised.

Will be coming back to them again for their excellent service and skills!

Thank you so much Needle Thread Alternations!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108999428687293985284/reviews
Kac,1,"honestly. i asked for a small repair change. i see online it is done by machine. and i came here and asked to get it done. the women who tend to me said it wouldnt be perfect and not exactly the same. i took that and paid $10
im so disappointed and im not sure to cry or laugh. the results. theyre couldnt even make it the same size. i honestly couldve done the same. $10 is a scam for little hard work. 0 effort. wasted money. i think you can tell what i wanted vs what i disappointingly got. üôÑüòêüòê so on top of that wasted $10. i might go ahead and sew on some more thread.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100914731207849767265/reviews
