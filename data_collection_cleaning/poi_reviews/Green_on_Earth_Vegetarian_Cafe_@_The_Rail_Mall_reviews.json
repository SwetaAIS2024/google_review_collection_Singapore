      "text": "Went with my family to celebrate my uncle‚Äôs birthday, knowing the food here is always great. I also appreciated that they helped store the birthday cake in their freezer before our dinner. My favorite dish of the evening was the È¶ôËæ£ÁÉ§Á¥†È±º‚Äîabsolutely delicious! üëçüèª\n\nThat said, I‚Äôm giving 4 stars due to the lack of customer service. We wanted to take some nice group photos to commemorate the gathering and asked one of the servers for help. To make it easier, I angled the camera to minimise the appearance of the un-cleared dishes on our table, but the server took the photos hastily without even a 3-2-1 countdown or effort to adjust the angle. The photos turned out cluttered with dishes in the background, and when I politely asked for a retake, she showed visible impatience.\n\nWhen we asked her to take another photo using my uncle‚Äôs phone, she rushed through it again, glancing toward the kitchen and making us feel like a burden. The entire process would have taken only 2‚Äì3 minutes, yet her attitude left a disappointing impression‚Äîespecially considering we spent over $230 here and specifically chose this place to celebrate a special occasion.\n\nWhile I understand the staff were busy, good customer service includes helping guests capture their moments. A little effort in taking nice photos wouldn‚Äôt hurt and could even encourage positive posts on social media. Unfortunately, the server‚Äôs impatience and lack of care resulted in unflattering photos that couldn‚Äôt be shared. I hope the restaurant can improve this aspect of their service.\n\nTLDR: food is great but customer service is lacking.",
