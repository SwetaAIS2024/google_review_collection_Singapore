MrA,3,"This eating house is rather rundown but it offers free parking for up to 6 vehicles. The roasted chicken rice is of acceptable standard at $3.50. The milk tea was selling at $1.30.

Many stalls were closed when I visited last week during lunchtime.

Please improve on the cleanliness as there was an irritating housefly while Iâ€™m eating.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112008289267740134602/reviews
