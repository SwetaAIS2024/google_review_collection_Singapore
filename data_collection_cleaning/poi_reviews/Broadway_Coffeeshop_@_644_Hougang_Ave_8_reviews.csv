Irene Tan M X,4,"Good variety of good yummylicious food situation in this coffeeshop!

Must-trys: Popiah, Wanton Mee, Satay, Hokkien Mee

🌯 Personally loved their Popiah here! 😋👍🏻 Must-order and I always dabao back home. Ingredients and “man guang” are fresh, not overly seasoned, blends well together and nicely wrapped! Recommend to add chili, not overly spicy but yet giving that extra spice aromatics! Really slurps just writing this review! 🤤

🥟🍜 Yummylicious Wanton Mee! Springy saucy noodles, thick char siew and meaty wantons.

🍜🦐🍗🍢 Hokkien Mee and Satay are good too! My easiest and nearest crave fix for Hokkien Mee and satay.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107234303898599875744/reviews
