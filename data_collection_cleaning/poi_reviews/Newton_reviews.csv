CHLOE LOW,4,"Short transit betw Newton Downtown Line (Blue) and North South Line (Red). Hair cut place at Blue line! Very convenient. Visit them soon :))

The red line station can be warm sometimes due to crowding & aircon under service. Friendly SMRT staff.

Landmarks: Newton Food Centre (famous for BBQ seafood, prawn mee, duck noodles, Thai food, Nasi Padang etc.)

Flo Yeow,5,"Thoroughly enjoy the Newton MRT station. It's probably one of the most important station connecting people from the West side of the country to the Central zones. The downtown line is probably one of the best addition to the rail system. Efficient, clean, and not a very long walk from the Blue to the Red lines, compared to some other interchanges.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Wee Gim Hong (Nbss),5,"I like this station very much, as because this is the only station have the access to the Downtown Line (Blue) (Newton (red line). The station is quite new as Downtown line only like 3 years ago. This station is one of the few stations that requires tap out to transfer in order to get to the Downtown or North South platform or exits located in this station. This station around in the vicinity has a some condominiums found here. There is a food Center located in this station’s exits (If I remember, to get to the food Center, it is at Exit A). This is the only interchange station that is really quiet as there isn’t any shopping malls located in Newton…",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105439552809381147212/reviews
