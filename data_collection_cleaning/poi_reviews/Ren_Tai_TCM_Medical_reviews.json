However, when I found Dr. Yuen, she used acupuncture, and after just a few sessions, my trigger finger finally recovered. Dr. Yuen is highly skilled in massage, acupuncture, and Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n\nAlthough she works alone and there can be a wait, it is well worth it for the quality of care she provides.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Yuen if you need any TCM treatment.",

Two acupunture  sessions on my back with doctor Yan and my slipped disc issue was solved in two weeks. It was truly a miracle. She is my go to doctor whenever my kids and I have physical issues since then. She is truly, 医者仁心，妙手回春。",

Did some ba Guan and after that felt relieved quite instantly. She was very patience and gave alot of  advice. Was told if the knee gets better then no need to come back for further treatment. Reasonable price and no hard sell.",
