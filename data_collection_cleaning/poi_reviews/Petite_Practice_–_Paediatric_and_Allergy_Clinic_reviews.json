Dr. Mohana is a wonderful pediatrician: she listens carefully, explains everything clearly, and is always patient and reassuring. The nurses are consistently warm, friendly, and make us feel genuinely cared for every time. We truly appreciate the care and attention our family receives here üòä",

      "text": "Dr mohana is good. The new doctor who is Mona something not that great in diagnosing correct illness with early symptoms. Maybe not that experienced? Will go back to Dr Mohana. The clinic and nurses there are rather caring, they gave me multiple follow up calls if I didn't turn up for further reviews- different from the rest of the pd I visited. The toys there are good quality. Also have a nursing room, diaper changing station (clinic can provide complimentary diapers in case of poo emergency)  and isolation room in case your child has contagious illness.\n\nBest of all, not crowded and rather spacious. Indeed my go-to pd.\n\nTake note they are not in partnership with any insurance panels starting 2025- you have to claim separately yourself for any medical bills",

We had to bring our baby in at short notice as he was unwell, and the team was able to slot us in despite their very full schedule. Dr Mohana as always was very patient and thorough during the checkup. Special shout out to all the nurses in the clinic as they are always super helpful and cheerful, which is a huge assurance to first time parents like ourselves especially when we have a sick child!",

      "text": "Repeat patient here. So happy for Dr Mohana to have moved to a new place just right opposite Katong i12. The whole clinic is clean and inviting.\n\nDr Mohana herself is genuinely respectful to children. She is so gentle and patient with everyone she meets, and most importantly she listens carefully to concerns raised and is thoughtful about the drugs she administers. I don't live nearby but I'm happy to drive down to the east just to see her when the kids fall ill.\n\nAlso very happy with the appointment system. It's easy to book a slot and see when the available timings are. Nurses are helpful. Special thanks to Usha for her gentle guidance on how to use an aerochamber. And the male nurse for being patient with my son ‚ù§Ô∏è",
