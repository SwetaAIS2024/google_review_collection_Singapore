Patrick Star,5,"I recently visited I Love Taimei at the Hillion Mall Outlet and was blown away by the warm, welcoming atmosphere created by their incredible staff! From the moment I walked in, the staff greeted me with genuine smiles and this made my visit more enjoyable. Their friendliness and attentiveness truly made the experience memorable—special shoutout to the staff member who patiently walked me through the menu and even recommended their personal favorites!

Now, here’s the great thing: I had no idea there was a voucher set included when paying for a meal and drink! What a fantastic surprise! This added value made my visit even better, and I’ll definitely be back to take advantage of this offer again. It’s little touches like these—paired with outstanding service—that keep customers like me coming back.

Thank you, I Love Taimei team from Hillion, for your kindness, warmth, and for making my day brighter. I’ll be recommending you to everyone I know. Keep up the amazing work!

Pro tip: Don’t forget to ask whether there’s any set meals or vouchers—it’s a game-changer!

Also, the food was delicious, and the drinks? Absolute perfection. 10/10!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108226494200789576599/reviews
