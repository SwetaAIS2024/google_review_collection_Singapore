celine andre,5,"Went a few times already for different problems. Dr Simon Low’s acupuncture skill is super good. Medications are all in tablet form, so no need to worry about having to brew and drink the medication. Highly recommended, but do make appointment by calling or watsapp first, as they can be quite full at times.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101365807889433653375/reviews
