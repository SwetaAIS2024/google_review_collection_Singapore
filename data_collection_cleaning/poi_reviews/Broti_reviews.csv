Kai,4,"Cute little place that piqued our interest. We just got some pastries at their neighbors, konditori, and though some cafe drinks would be a good match.

Had some trouble picking one and asked the staff for recommendations. She said her go-to was the peach matcha latte. Boy, was that a great pick.

One wouldn't normally think peach and matcha went together but it was so good. The only thing was that the cost was a tad steep.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103961412486889059100/reviews
Muhammad Hafiq,5,"Review for Broti

I’ve been a fan of Broti since its early days at the bazaar, and it never disappoints! The taste has remained consistently delicious over the years, which keeps me coming back.

The price is definitely worth it for the generous portion you get. This time, I got the Thai Green Milk Tea—one of my all-time favorites. Rich, smooth, and just the right level of sweetness. Highly recommend!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107992483335064360795/reviews

Adylina Wahab,1,"Ordered earl grey milk tea and mango brewed tea, their standard has dropped tremendously. Disappointing that they don't use to taste as good as they use to... Now they just taste of sugar..lack of any tea taste..",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113618759824447472774/reviews
