The price got cheaper from $4 and bigger portion!  Super happy\n\nYea the boss is a little slow. And I got my noodles faster cos I am the first in queue.\nHe has always been this speed since I can remember.",

It took us about 25 minutes to reach the front of the queue and have our orders taken. That would have been fine if the food was good, however, the standard of the mee pok noodles here are way below average. Noodles were stiff, bland and there was close to no ingredients in the bowl. Highly disappointing experience. Safe to say this would be my first and last time waiting in line for this stall.",
