Tio Gabriel Tio Yong Ping,4,"Restaurant is packed during lunch and dinner hour, thus come early to line up.

This outlet has limited table for 5 pax and above.
Food is unique and smells great but their taste is slightly disappointing.
Chicken comes with mushroom cream gravy which is their unique specialty. Hopefully they have more variety speciality from the selection.

They have decent service and atmosphere thou. Abit noisy due to crowded mall setting up",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112496304834029525242/reviews
Maya Ismail,5,"Had a great Mothers Day Lunch at Poulet Westgate. Food delivery, time to be seated, food quality and ambience were great! We were promptly served.

Sarah Yeo,5,I called to make a reservation for breaking fast. The manager is very friendly and polite. She sat us down and our food came just before we break fast. I appreciate her help. The food is good. We had the 3 course set meal for two. Every dish is delicious. The staff are nice too. Thank you,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104288138056419184329/reviews
Nur Iqlimah,5,"My first time trying Poulet..been wanting to try since loooooong time ago. Always long queue at causeway point site..saw one outlet at Westgate and why not...

The duck and mushroom croquette was really superb!! Like legit! 3 wasn't enough tbh. Lol

Both spicy sausage pasta  (with clam and not with clam) was alright. Not spicy to us. Maybe cause the visual was so amazing and look delicious, that I totally forgot to take photo first. But yeah, taste was alright.

Dessert, Choco creme brulee was legit awesome too! It was mix of sour, sweet and bitter! Sour due to raspberry, sweet due to the crystalized sugar and bitter due to dark chocolate.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112154388875110526113/reviews
