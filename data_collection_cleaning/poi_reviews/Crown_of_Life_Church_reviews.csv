Loke Wei May,5,"God's very real Presence every meeting in Crown of Life has met my needs to know God's Truths and to meet Jesus in a real way. The Holy Spirit's Annointing and Fire is poured out so there is Life! I receive so much impartations of Fire that  has restored my  throat from lumps that have plagued me for years. I learn to discern spirits and have learnt so much how to win in spiritual warfare, and I am still learning! My family life and work life saw great improvements. Most of all, there is completeness in the building up of the Truth System by the declaration and teaching of all the 66 books of the bible so I am solidly grounded in the Truth. There is Life and power in the ministry. I also saw miraculous healings for my daughter and my maid when I first joined the church. Their shorter arms were restored to be in balance as the same length with the other arm in a matter of seconds! I was so amazed. Over time, I grew in understanding of the discernment of the End Times, which were also taught based solidly on the Word of God. There is accuracy in the discernment of times and seasons. I am so blessed and I thank Jesus for leading me to Crown of Life, to be ministered and taught by annointed and godly Pastors! Praise Jesus! Thank you Jesus! Thank you Crown of Life Church! Hallelujah!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113724626975350893833/reviews
