While the field lights are not turned on at nights, the ambient lights provide some lighting for late night and early morning activities.\n\nThe toilets are a little outdated, but well equipped with showers, changing areas, and are well maintained.",

Love that it has minimal restrictions on entry so it remains to me the most accessible track for running, even in the early hours of the morning. Always a wonderful meeting place for the run and sport community. Tennis courts for booking too!",

Unlike those near housing estate, you do not have parents with kids strolling around. Users therefore can focus on thier training and also be motivated by the other around the stadium. üëç",

Several lanes have cones around segments of rubber in disrepair, while rubber is bubbling up in others.\n\nAdditionally, several runners go in opposite direction to flow, which regulars tell me is a common occurrence. It necessitates one or both parties avoiding each other and could be solved if all ran in the same direction.",
