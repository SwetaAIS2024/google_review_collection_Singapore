David Khu,5,"I had an excellent experience renting a car from Wallace Ang! From start to finish, the process was smooth, professional, and hassle-free. Wallace was incredibly responsive and friendly, making sure all my questions were answered and that I felt confident before confirming the rental. The vehicle was in great condition—clean, well-maintained, and exactly as described.

What really stood out was Wallace's attention to detail and genuine care for his customers. I wouldn’t hesitate to rent from him again and highly recommend his service to anyone looking for a reliable and pleasant car rental experience.

Thanks again, Wallace! Will definitely be back!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104322868202793674286/reviews

Moritz Sum,1,Returned car in early May 2023 and till date >3 months later still didn't receive back my rental deposits despite messages/emails every week. There can be no poorer service and the company's unethical practice of withholding rental deposits for many months really is not encouraging customers to ever return.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116031339815849810633/reviews

dania syuhada,1,"good range of cars, but manpower sucks. only deploy one person on standby. feel bad for them, as if they have no life. feedback, maybe put 2-3 people on standby. if there’s any problem, at least the one closest to the customer can attend to them. v pitiful for the staff.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116543253057451702508/reviews
