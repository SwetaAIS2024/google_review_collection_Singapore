Bigman,5,"This is one of the famous duck rice stall in bukit Panjang area, ordered the kwai teow with yellow noodle, added a liver - price is only $3.70, portion is just nice, the taste is just nice for me not salty at all, will come back again
Highly recommended - must try",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109542132809180614554/reviews
