Cherry Choi,4,"a very beautiful place for a walk, for cycling and for exercise as well. one little shortfall, the same pathway is shared among pedestrian, runner and biker. if you are going for biking, will need to beware of other users, especially the kids who are running around. There's some restaurants nearby, would be nice to end the walk with a seafood dinner around. good place for some family time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103309438624275794510/reviews
