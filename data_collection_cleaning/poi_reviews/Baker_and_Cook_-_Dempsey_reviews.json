      "text": "A beautiful spot tucked away in Dempsey, perfect for slow mornings and great bread. We came for the new brunch menu and were genuinely impressed — every dish is anchored by their 37-year-old sourdough starter (Little Johnny), giving everything from the bread board to the Dutch Baby Pancake an artisanal touch. The sourdough pasta with seafood was a standout, and the leafy, relaxed setting made it a joy to linger. Warm service, thoughtful food, and a menu that’s both comforting and elevated. Highly recommend!",

Everything was beautifully prepared, and you cannot get better windows and light in a cafe than here! Helpful and efficient staff too.",

      "text": "Food was not worth the price paid.  Portion of food was unexpectedly underwhelming. $25 for a plate like that I would expect the meat portion to be more generous and packed; rather than what I’m getting as can be seen in the picture. Also, this plate of Rueben sandwich with truffle fries was extremely oily as you can see on the plate. Honestly, would not return and would not order this again as portion was disappointing.\n\nCan see that they don’t focus on food here but just rely on the atmosphere and surrounding area to hopefully attract customers as this is Dempsey area.",
