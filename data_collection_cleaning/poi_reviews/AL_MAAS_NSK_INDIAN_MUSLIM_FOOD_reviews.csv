Ars 3276,4,"Seems to be a change of prata 'chefs' as 2 new faces. Been awhile since my last visit and prata now is so much better + curry sedap.

Glad to have a good prata place around the hood.

N. FALAH,5,"I've been to this kopi shop for a number of years. I always come to eat NSK Indian Muslim food since I'm a Muslim, and I can say it never disappoints me. I consistently bring my friends here and they too find the food to be decent. Last time, this kopi shop was not able to use Payton. The world has been engulfed and I'm happy to be able to use paynow. The only time the house is full is during dinner hour. Apart from that, there aren't many people. i recommend you the prata here. It may not be the best, but it's one of the best.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107100436219599443853/reviews
rachel peachy durians,5,"Tonight i ordered idly, vadai, and boneless chicken to go. Initially only wanted idly and vadai but uncle persuaded me to try the boneless chicken and I’m glad i did. It’s yummy; tastes like tandoori chicken, but it’s fried and meat is juicy (full disclosure- i heated it up in the airfryer when i got home). The dal went well with the idly; spices are well-proportioned and seasons the idly nicely. I can’t really comment on the vadai because my 3 year old daughter took it without permission and finished it but she only finishes food she likes so i guess it must have been pretty good. I include a photo of her theft. Will return when I’m in the area looking for food.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109080026179896688446/reviews
YY,2,"One of the worst prata curries I have ever eaten..

While the prata was crispy and decent (made to order), the curry was super oily - so much so that I can’t even taste any curry. Totally spoilt the taste and dish altogether.

Not a stall that I would revisit given the poor curry..",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
