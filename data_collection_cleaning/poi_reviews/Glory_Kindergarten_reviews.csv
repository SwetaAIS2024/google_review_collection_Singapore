Valerie Yeo,5,Glory kindergarten provided a safe and nurturing environment for my children to learn. The teachers and staff are attentive and loving to the students. It is a big family where everyone understands the needs of young minds and prepares them for their primary school education. We love Glory kindergarten and are blessed to be part of this big family!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114865760213326881545/reviews
Cuki Buay,1,"When my child was there I witness this group of mothers who say falseful accusations of children they do not want near their children (daughters specifically). There was this super happy boy , not hyperactive, got complained and left.(the school management is weak) This frail looking bespectacled Hannah daughter of the same mother gang swang her full water bottle 360deg when the class was given free activity. Her mother spoke to us first so my daughter thought hannah as a friend and always run to her to play. My child came back with big bruises at the tummy a few times and other times bruises at other parts of the body. The 'teacher'  Mrs Yeo lied about not seen what happened. and later some one told me about Hannah doing that. Only then did the bruises stopped after I spoke to Mrs yeo. I saw a father confronting her about something at the school gate one day. He wasn't loud but their facial expressions tell. I only remember this school with extremely bad memories.
So many bad memories here's one more. My child said they were given pandan cakes daily. They were very dry. One day the teachers chided me repeatedly for at least 2 days for over feeding my child before school because my child vommited during break time at 930am. I was puzzled, i told them it was as any other days. with children it is difficult to know what is going on so I did not pursue. My child repeatedly said the pandan cake were very dry. It took me a few days to realise that my child had choked on the food. It must be something serious coz the teachers shushed up suspiciously after a day or 2 suddenly.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103115016113316647697/reviews
