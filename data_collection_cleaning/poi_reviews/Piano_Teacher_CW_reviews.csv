Daniel T,5,"I have been taking piano lessons with Cheng Wei for 5 months as an adult learner. Having no musical background, I knew that having an experienced, patient teacher who could flex according to my learning pace was critical.

Cheng Wei is a wonderful teacher. She makes sure that I first master the fundamentals (e.g. scales) and has also provided me with very clear advice on form and technique. This has allowed me to develop a strong base which has accelerated my pace of learning. Very important as a working adult with sometimes limited practice time.

Also, she is highly experienced and her lessons are always tailored to my ability and ambitions. Already targeting several key learning milestones next year!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110423757265489326765/reviews
