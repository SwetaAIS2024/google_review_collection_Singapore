Jonathan Koh,4,"When I first entered the restaurant, I was warmly greeted and impressed by the attentive service. However, my enthusiasm dipped slightly when we were seated—our chairs were noticeably worn, and the decor felt outdated.

Fortunately, any doubts quickly disappeared once the food arrived. Each dish was beautifully presented and full of rich, fresh flavors. It was clear that a lot of care went into the cooking, from the appetizers all the way to dessert.

The service remained excellent throughout—helpful and professional without being intrusive. By the end of the meal, the worn furniture felt like a minor flaw in an otherwise outstanding experience.

Overall, while the ambiance could use a refresh, the food and service were top-notch. I’d definitely return and recommend it to others.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110322417305771163637/reviews

Ivan Michael Pung,5,"Crystal Jade Pavilion

Service : Impressive standards at this outlets. We have an Indonesia helper with us and we were trying to order food with no pork usage at all. The waiter gave us some advice and left. He came back shortly with a menu circling all the dishes that don’t have any pork. 👍👍👍 and the waiter and waitress are friendly, patient and very helpful. Kept my mums wheelchair, help us get seated, didn’t rush our order or meal even when the restaurant starts to fill up.

Food : We ordered mainly Dim Sum dishes followed by some main from the menu. It’s good! Full on restaurant setting, standard and the food was flavourful, delicious and fulfilling. Highly recommend the braised chicken 🐓 feet, Haa Kao 🥟🥟🥟 and the Egg Hor Fun 🍜. (Especially the Hor Fun!) Overall, excellent cooking skills.

Environment : This brunch has a great view of the ocean 🌅, facing Sentosa 🎢🎡🏞️. You can choose to be seated next to the large glass wall to catch the view. It also gets very busy during lunch and dinner so either make a reservation or go early.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100551027047446956883/reviews
G Z,4,"A perennial fave, we came to try their dim sum again after their rebranding to Crystal Jade Pavillion. Decent quality food, but perhaps we ordered too much fried food and needed loads of Chinese tea (香片). Thankfully their tea quality is good too and remained concentrated over at least 2 pots.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115201872598341368949/reviews
Botak,5,"The food, though delicious, cost a bomb, and since we were too lazy to go hunting,  I decided to buy my family a treat.

My favourite was definitely the peking duck with its crispy duck skin, but the worst tasting was also from the same duck...the flesh was so tough.

The rest of the food was typical of most Chinese restaurants.

Can eat if you are feeling rich.

PS: return the pickles which they place on your table; can save u some money and your tastebuds. One of the worst I've tasted.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100060791396189603978/reviews
