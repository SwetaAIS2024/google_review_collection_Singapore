Despite being a stall within the hawker center, don't be fooled by it, the taste is on par with those popular chain stores within shopping malls. Even though I ordered based on 25% sugar level, the bubble tea still taste super gao. Highly recommended if you are in this hawker center. It's located at level 2 of the hawker center, right side of the escalator so you don't miss it. By the way price is very economical too.",

      "text": "Okay, I'm a frequent buyer from this stall but sometimes, I get some inconsistency in the drinks (either too sweet or sometimes more fruits, sometimes less) which gets a little bit irritating because as buyers, we re-prchase a product holding the expectation that the quality holds. So it was a little disappointing sometimes when I could not enjoy the drink with the taste that I once had before. Just today, I had to throw my milk tea away because the sugar level was obviously adjusted wrongly (it is way too sweet than usual I wonder if the staff pressed it wrongly  because as someone with a sweet tooth, I still find the drink too sweet to be drinkable). Other than this, I love the type of drinks available at T-bar and the price is reasonably good.",

Value for money!\n\nNoted their number 1 drink is fruit tea.\nIt has big slices of watermelon with mixture of diced mango, passion fruit, pineapple etc. $3.50 for small. 0% sugar is already sweet.\n\nPeach tea white pearl also nice. 0% sugar already sweet from the pearls.\n\nMy husband tried the durian milkshake, super strong flavour, overwhelming for him. I did not enjoy the honey green tea or pure green tea, it's more like sweet Jasmin tea.\n\nService is good! Free straws of different sizes and plastic bags provided.",
