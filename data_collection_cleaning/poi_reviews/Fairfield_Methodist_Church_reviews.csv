Adam Lee,5,"The Methodist Church in Singapore (MCS) is the church that Methodists in Singapore belong to. The Church has 46 churches island-wide with around 42,000 members, and is the largest mainline Protestant denomination in Singapore. Its current bishop and head of the Church is Bishop Dr Chong Chin Chung (family name Chong) who was elected in 2016. The Church also has 15 schools, 13 kindergartens and 5 childcare centres under its umbrella.

The site of Fairfield Methodist Church was formerly Metropole, otherwise known as Jing Hwa Cinema (金華大戯院).

It was one of Chinatown's, if not, Singapore's three famous cinemas, the others being Oriental and Majestic. Designed in the Modernist style by local architect Wong Foo Nam, the building was completed in 1958.

The cinema ceased operations in October 1985. Fairfield Methodist Church subsequently acquired the building, which underwent renovations in 1986; additional rooms and church fixtures such as an altar and communion rail were added. Most of the original spaces, however, were kept intact.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115680102960193169110/reviews
Lovely Cameraman,5,"And remember when the angels said, ""O Mary, God sends you the good news of a Command of His: his name shall be Messiah, Jesus son of Mary. He will be highly honored in this world and in the Next World and he will be among those favored by God. He will speak to the people alike when in the cradle and when grown up, and he will be among the righteous."" Hearing this, Mary said, ""How, O Lord, shall I have a son, when no man has ever touched me?"" ""Thus shall it be,"" was the answer. God creates whatever He wills. When He decrees a thing, He only says, ""Be"" and it is. (Continuing their message, the angels added,) ""And God will teach him the Book and wisdom, and give him the knowledge of the Torah and the Gospel, and appoint him as His Messenger to the children of Israel.""",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114888323272768689180/reviews
