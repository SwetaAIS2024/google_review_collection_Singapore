Elisa Liu,5,"Little corner kopitiam shop with a big variety of local breakfast food. Love the chweekuey here, chee cheong fun and yam cake. Yam cake has chunks of yam inside. Caipor on chweekuey is tasty and not too salty.

Staff is really friendly despite being super busy (queue is constant). Even takes time to adjust the condiments/seasonings on your items if you're not a fan of sweet sauce or chili.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110628219914992375452/reviews
