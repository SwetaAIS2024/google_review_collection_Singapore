MH Tham,5,"Popped in for the air-con actually and was pleasantly surprised by the wide range of novelty items and souvenirs.

Contrary to my expectations, the prices were quite reasonable, unlike the zooâ€™s souvenir shop before its revamp. There are also unique spaces for gaming activities, pet-friendly events, and an outdoor area with even more shopping options.

Definitely worth a visit for souvenir hunting and a fun outing with your furkids!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112376174358198242550/reviews
