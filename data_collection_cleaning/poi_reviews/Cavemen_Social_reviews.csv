JATHL,5,"Really nice, casual yet elegant restaurant. If you want a steak, you get to walk over and choose a cut from their next door butchery. I love that they had one of the harder to find cuts, the flat iron.
Steak didn’t have a hard sear but was still very good. I’m guessing they have an in-house special seasoning.
I also tried their grilled octopus, which was equally good.
There are a few other options if you’re not a steak lover, like fish and chips, pasta and bangers and mash, just to name a few.
Their happy hour deals on drinks are pretty decent too.
Waitress on duty was very polite and helpful.
Looking forward to trying a thicker cut steak on my next visit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110357299060106350854/reviews
Ivan Loh,3,"A group of us went there for some pre-dinner drinks and bites. We had a 8:30pm dinner reservation nearby, so we thought of starting the night here. We noticed that it wasn't so crowded on a Friday night, and you would be able to get a table quite easily without a reservation. I called before heading over to make a reservation, but the staff who answered the phone said to just walk in. To be honest, the beef selection in the chiller display wasn't great. There were just a few options to choose from, so we ended up not ordering any beef. The cheese list was limited as well, but both the cheeses we selected were good. We ordered truffle fries and the fried corn, which were both decent. Not bad at all, just standard. The only negative feedback is on the service process that this place has. It's not very efficient. Besides beer, all other drinks are made, poured, and served by one guy, who also takes food orders and helps customers out at the butcher side. There were only 2 wait staff when we were there, and the other one couldn't even take our drink orders because we had to wait for the other one to come back from the butcher side. The place was not crowded at all, but we had to wait 20 mins to get a martini and a pour of whiskey on the rocks. Overall, the food and drinks are ok. The service process probably needs to improve. Our bill for a party of 4 (A few happy hour drinks and 3 bar bites) worked out to about $140.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114542374982525257775/reviews
Yeow Margaret,5,Love the truffle Brie that came complete with crackers and apricot. Got the Argentinian and Us prime steaks from the kitchen next door. Lychee draft was quite cool! Also had the sausages from the kitchen.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111292611918933968235/reviews
Ruth Go,4,"The type of restaurant that lets you pick your slab of meat and let them cook it.
We opted for the tomahawk and had them cook it medium (as their recommendation, we initially wanted it medium rare). The flavours are nice, very well seasoned. The char on the meat is just wonderful. The only issue we had is that quite a number of slices on the side were medium well and almost well done. So we didn't enjoy it as much as the middle pieces.
Would give it another chance next time since the flavours were really there and the extra side we ordered (tater tots) were very nice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112369372959976661693/reviews
Rei Axl Ye,5,"Was here for the missus's birthday, choosing the cut was a new experience for us and the staff was informative and patient. Food itself was well done and presented, the steak is tender, flavorful and juicy, checks all the right boxes for meat lovers like myself, the octopus is another highlight here. Wasnt too crowded during my visit, definitely a good choice for your next special occasion.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115827926540149694576/reviews
