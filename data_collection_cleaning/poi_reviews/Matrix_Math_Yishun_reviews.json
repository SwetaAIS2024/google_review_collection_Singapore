      "text": "Both my kids attended lessons with Matrix Math for many years. My elder son scored very well (A1 and A2) for his O Levels EMath and AMath respectively. During his time with Matrix Math, my son has developed strong interests in Math and this has certainly helped him in getting a very good course in the Polytechnic now. Once in a while, my son still returns to the center to look for his tutor as he has established a strong bonding with him.\n\nAs for my younger daughter, she is currently attending Sec 2 Math lesson at the center. When she started few years ago, her Math grades were not ideal and throughout the years with Matrix Math and under the patience and guidance of the teachers in Yishun branch, she has now excelled in the subject and even became a role model for her classmates in school.\n\nI’m thankful to Matrix Math for bringing my kids to where they are today despite me having little time to monitor them due to my busy work schedule. The teachers there have gone the extra mile to ensure my kids’ well-being are taken care of and well prepared for their school assessments at all times.",

      "text": "MatrixMath@Yishun,\nI must express my deep disappointment and\nIt is unacceptable that the teachers have seemingly given up on keeping my kid engaged and motivated in her learning. As educators, it should be your top priority to find ways to spark her interest and provide the support she needs, rather than simply accepting a lack of progress.\nI feel the teachers have not made a sincere effort to explore different teaching methods, provide more individualized attention, or regularly monitor her progress to make the necessary adjustments. It is extremely concerning that you are willing to give up on a student who is clearly struggling and in need of extra help.\nThis is not the level of care and commitment I expected from your center. Your role should be to go above and beyond to ensure each student, she is able to succeed and develop a genuine passion for the subject matter.",

She is also motivated and excited to complete her maths hw. No more grumbling...Matrix doesnt really drill. They really have an easier method to teach complicated maths questions. Keep it up.",

No words can describe my gratitude towards her on her effect put in. Thank you once again!!!",
