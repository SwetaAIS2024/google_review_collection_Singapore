EQ Xavier,4,"Tried the  Soon Kee Braised Duck, and I must say, it's a real deal. The duck is tender and has a wonderful texture that just falls apart. The braised egg and tofu are also perfectly cooked, absorbing all the rich flavors of the sauce. What really stood out to me, though, was the chilli. It's special because it has visible chilli flakes that add an extra kick. The herbal soup is also delicious and pairs perfectly with the duck.

My only complaint is that the pork intestines had a bit of a funky smell. However, the price is very reasonable, and the location is convenient, especially for those near the school.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533019712721928126/reviews
Kong Wen Sheng,1,"I don’t usually give 1star review unless customer service very bad or food tastes very bad. Today is an exception because I feel like my spouse has been exploited just because she sounded foreigner and we looked too nice. She ordered a Kway Chap set for two and it costed $12, without a lot of meat or intestines to justify the cost, the kway chap (noodles) were not cooked well. I could almost taste the dough as they stuck together. On top of all these, it doesn’t even feed half of us! This is an extremely bad eating experience with this newly opened duck rice in my neighbourhood.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105513610287991060707/reviews
helen chong,5,"Springleaf Soon Kee Duck Rice located just beside Springleaf MRT Station is an old school type shop . Ordered both the rice & kway teow , both are nice with the tasteful duck.  The ice lemon tea & hot coffee are especially good too. Always feeling very satisfied after every meal . 7 mins walking distance from Springleaf Nature Park Carpark if carpark full at the shop houses.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117367009263871660823/reviews
Sam Toh (Sammy),5,"I had the pleasure of dining at Soon Kee and was absolutely delighted by their nostalgic set-up and flavorful braised dishes. The braised duck was tender and succulent, bursting with rich and aromatic flavors that transported me back in time. The variety of other braised items on offer added a delightful twist to the meal, each dish carrying its own unique blend of tastes. The ambiance, reminiscent of a bygone era, added an extra layer of charm to the experience. Soon Kee's dedication to preserving the essence of traditional flavors while creating a warm, inviting atmosphere makes it a must-visit for those seeking a taste of nostalgia and a truly satisfying meal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110777175975209979259/reviews

Had braised duck noodles ($4.50) for lunch, was good! I'll be back to try other items on the menu, including kway chap.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
