Melvin Lim,5,"This is a take out place. They offer a variety of salads and other hot meals.

We ordered the Smoke Duck Delight salad to compliment our Kimbap and quail eggs dinner. The portion is quite big and the vegetables are fresh. All ingredients are well prepared and served.

If you are looking for a quick bite, give it a try.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108538147964918099161/reviews

frankie ng,5,"Recently spotted this new stall while on the way home from Tg Pagar MRT and bought their chicken breast salad to give it a try. I would say their portion is generous, and the breast meat was fresh and tender. The sauce that goes with it is spicy enough which I like it very much. Location is convenient because is near to MRT, anyone can just grab and go. Service staff has good attitude which make me want to return and try their beef and duck salad next.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106796666538832927907/reviews

Janis Teo,5,"Tried their Chicken Bowl recently and it was nice:) with the kick of spicy peri peri sauce, together with the soup of the day, best especially during raining days. Would go try other signature bowls once have the time to:)Do check out this place if you are near the CBD area.
