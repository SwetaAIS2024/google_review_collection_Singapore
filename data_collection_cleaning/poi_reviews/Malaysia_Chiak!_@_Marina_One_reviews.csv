Teh C Gao Siew Dai,2,"Subsequent visit 4 August 2023. Ordered the Prawn Paste Chicken Curry Rice. Taste was average. Service at the drinks stall was terrible. Staff took such a long time to brew the drinks, resulting in few people queueing.

Visited on 16 June 2023. Ordered the Chicken Cutlet Curry Rice and Teh C. For the curry rice, the chicken meat was tough as it might be cooked a while ago before being displayed. For the drink, observed that the staff took longer than it normally would to prepare drinks, thus resulting in a longer wait than necessary.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102646679801920717610/reviews
Hartono Harjono,4,"Came here during weekday lunch time. You will see very long queue, have to give effort to get seat. The food, definitely great. Few variety including kuew tiaw, chicken curry rice, minc meat noodle and beverage. Too bad no more chendol stall. Reasonable food price between $4-8. Straight forward service from staff, but I came here for food not for the service. Would be great if they can expand the space for more seat available.

EM,1,Be careful of the char kway Teow store. The old man just DGAF. See picture and you’ll know. I used 3 tissues to soak up the oil and that’s after using the 3rd tissue. Don’t eat if you don’t wish to die faster.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104722252069948339538/reviews
