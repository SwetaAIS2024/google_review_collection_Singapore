Isaac Sam,4,"This bar in Balestier offers reasonably priced drinks, making it a great spot for a casual evening out. Their extensive food menu focuses on Indian cuisine, adding a unique touch to the experience. While we only stopped by for a quick thirst quencher—a refreshing Highball—the menu looked promising. We will definitely be back to try their Chicken Butter Masala, which is their best-seller.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108426703400532001032/reviews

Qwerty,1,"Ordered 1 tower of Blanc 1664, beer tasted so pale. Evident that they mixed with water to cut costs, the beer was diluted. Struggled to finish so better to go for 1 pint to test it's quality.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104163904906912293158/reviews
Nicholas Lam,5,"Passed this place a few times but noticed that they have KwayTiaoKia recently. Could be me not paying attention so, decided to come by to try.
Had this in JB before and it was really good. It expensive based on JB standards.

Here, the staff was patient and let us select what we wanted to eat with the noodles.
The choices were amazing.
Prices are more than reasonable if you compared it to WoonKiang (RM66 vs S$26 for 3).
Strictly speaking (and me being honest), the kwaytiaokia in JB was smoother, and much more flavourful as well as much more in the bowl.
However, this was made up for the choices of accompanying foods here.
Amazing decision to drop by.
Do note that parking is sparse and limited.

They have also a wide selection of zichar choices should 卤not be your palette.

Thank you The Den.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104060762909080187984/reviews
