Other condiments on sale like the chilli and dried sambal prawn aka hei bi hiam on sale in a bottle too. Will come back again to try other other items. Auntie is very friendly. Parking is available at the multi storey  beside this coffee shop.",

Raddish has the right balance of flavour and crunchiness. Though I ask for extra chilli but was only given a small amount....guess the staff must have been instructed to control the amount no matter what customer's request.\n5 pieces for $3.50",

Unfortunately this happy experience was hampered by a very very rude serving staff this morning. It was like the customer had to beg her for everything  !!! It really spoiled the mood for a nice traditional breakfast. I definitely won't go back to Jian Bo.",

      "text": "Jian Bo is still the best Shui Kueh in SG, IMHO. Soft silky rice cakes, with a oohlala savoury, tangy, crunchy turnip garnish, and when mixed with the spicy chilli, never fails to give me that Ratatouille moment. Pair that with a hot cup of Kopi-O, wow... Heaven is on earth! Have been patronising the stall for a while, and service is ok. Just upgrade that with a smile and a hearty \"ni hau\".",
