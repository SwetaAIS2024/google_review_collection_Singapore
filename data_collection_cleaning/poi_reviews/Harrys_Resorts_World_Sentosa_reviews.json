      "text": "Harry Resorts World Sentosa is truly stands out! This place is a must-visit in Sentosa area. The food boasts flavourful options. Pizza features a thin crust and crispy texture. Fish and Chips is generously portioned and reasonably priced. It pair well with Beer.Their kid meal is well-suited for young diners. They incorporated WOW Factor. Peter, their formal service provider, exemplified extraordinary kindness and professionalism, demonstrating the significant influence of even a small act of kindness. He proved to be exceptional with children and gained my parents' appreciation. Peter eschewed high-pressure sales techniques and provided comprehensive explanations of the menu. Even in a crowded restaurant, numerous customers specifically requested his service. He delivered outstanding service consistently to all patrons. We were extremely impressed. Thank you for providing insightful food recommendations. Peter undoubtedly positively impacts his brand. We left with full bellies and happy hearts.Harry should really proud for their menu merchandising.",
