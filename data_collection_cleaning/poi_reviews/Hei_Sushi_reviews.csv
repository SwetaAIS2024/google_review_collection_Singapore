Catwoman77,1,"Just bought 2 boxes of egg sushi. Ask for extra sauce. As 1 pack is not enough. I politely ask for extra pack, auntie raised her voice and said ""NO!"". Not the first time. This old auntie is very rude. Has patronised the stall for few years. Auntie still never change her attitude.

Nurul Naimah,1,"I called IMM outlet 5 times to cancel order to due last minute emergency (5 minutes after I placed the order). No one picked up my call. Even calling other outlets in hopes they can assist to get through them - the staff can't even help because ""it's not their branch"". I've checked reviews from other customers they also experienced similar cases. Are your phones even working??",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111014596029674603142/reviews
