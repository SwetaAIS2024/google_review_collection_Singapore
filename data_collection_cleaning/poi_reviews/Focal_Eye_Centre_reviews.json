Doc and her staff seem well trained in handling kids, toddlers till teens, that explains why we do need to wait longer on specific days where appointments are back to backs. Doc Zena gives good and realistic advice each time, allows the parents a good grasp of condition before taking next steps. Assistants are efficient and thus helps in the overall process.",

Moreover, I would like to commend the clinic staff. They are efficient and definitely get the job done, just like how I'm able to receive my new spectacles within a short amount of time. Dr Zena's clinic charges are also reasonable. Thank you Focal Eye Centre!\n\n10/10 would recommend",
