      "text": "Dishonest Company.\n\nAs an SME, We compare quotations with 3 comapnies.\n\nRenus Logistics had the lowest quote and lead time, we confirmed our shipment with them.\nOn our 1st Shipment with quoted transit time of 28 days, the container was delayed and took an additional 7 weeks to arrive in Singapore's Port.\n\nAgain, Renus Logisitcs provided the lowest quotation and we worked with them for the 2nd shipment from Europe and paid extra to have the shipment expedited. 2 Days before shipment arrival, was told to top up an additional $390 as they have under quoted. I felt threatened by their import manager Zul, that if we did not make full payments including the additional cost, they will not release my 40ft container from the port.\n\nWill fill a suit with small claims tribunal against them.\n\nThere are alot of other cheaper and reliable freight forwarder in Singapore. Just beware of them claiming to under quote and request for payment prior to releasing the container from port.",
