SailwithYJ Tang,1,"Not nice! The Mala doesn’t have the basic  taste of numbness and it’s not spicy.

The ingredients tasted like they just simply boiled it in chilli water and serve straight up on the plate.

Peanut is not crunchy too.

Overall won’t recommend this shop!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113894481639858210768/reviews
