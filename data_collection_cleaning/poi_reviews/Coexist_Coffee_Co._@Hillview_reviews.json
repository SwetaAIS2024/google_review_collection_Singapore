      "text": "Your OTHER Coexist Coffee that‚Äôs of a different class and vibe.\n\nUnlike the one in the East, this Coexist coffee cafe is just a surprise. It‚Äôs situated at the rooftop of an industrial building with VERY limited parking around the building. If you fear parallel parking, park somewhere else and head over, your life would be better.\n\nFood is excellent with a special twist. I took the Thai Toast something and the Laksa Fish and Chips. Both has that tangy sour taste with a nice delicious touch. Seatings are limited but they have that outdoor option which was not available when I arrived. It was a warm day.\n\nDrinks were decent and coffee was sufficiently strong.\n\nIf you are lost, find the passenger lift with the dance pole and take it up to 7th storey then look for signs to Coexist, you won‚Äôt miss it.",

It‚Äôs tucked away in a pretty ulu spot, and you‚Äôll need to hike up a short flight of stairs to reach this ‚Äúhidden‚Äù rooftop cafe‚Äîbut the views and food are totally worth it! I was pleasantly surprised that such a small, cosy space could serve up such quality coffee and well-curated dishes. Definitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre in the area.",

The coffee was absolutely amazing‚Äîso much so that I ended up ordering 3 cups! The breakfast was also really good, though it can be a little pricey, but totally worth it for the quality.\n\nIf you‚Äôre living near Hillview and looking for a chill breakfast spot, this place is definitely a must-try. The vibe is relaxed and the food is top-notch.",

Had the chilli crab shakshuka and Thai crabby toastie, and both were amazing. Very strong flavors and the portion size is good. 10/10 will come back!",
