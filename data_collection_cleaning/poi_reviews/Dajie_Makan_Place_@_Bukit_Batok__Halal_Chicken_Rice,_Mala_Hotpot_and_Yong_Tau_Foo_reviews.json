Don't be fooled by the facade as their menu is very extensive. Many diners opt for the chicken rice set with YTF. If not, the chicken rice sets are good options!\n\nThe last time I was here, I spied additional items like fried rice and sliced fish dishes on a handwritten whiteboard.\n\nThe place gets crowded during mealtimes. If not, they are busy preparing for food delivery orders.",

Staff are friendly and efficient!\n\nThe chicken rice is pretty good, to me the amount of chicken is slightly more than usual stalls ðŸ˜…\n\nI always get the Ampang sauce for yong tau foo. The fried items are always nicely done and they will cook the veggies separately. Yet to try the other bases but there is also Hakka sauce, Tom Yum, laksa and soup!\n\nOverall, worth to stop by this place for a satisfying meal if youâ€™re nearby. Itâ€™s just across the street from the MRT anyway. They sell kopi/teh, canned beverages and also accept various cashless payments too",

So hopefully they can look into this.\n\nThe food can be nice, the staff can be wonderful but when the set up is uncomfortable, the whole experienced is compromised. Again, hope they will look into this.\n\nFood : 4 / 5\nStaff : 4 / 5\nAmbience: 2 / 5",

It's not about the amount I paid but it's when I called the bukit gombak branch to tell them about the issues, instead of apologizing the staff was very rude and just simply said ' oh ok! Nanti kita refund la! Like I said it's not the refund that I wanted but at least she could be more tactful in talking to the customer. Sometimes it's because of these kind of rude staff that made customers never want to come back.",
