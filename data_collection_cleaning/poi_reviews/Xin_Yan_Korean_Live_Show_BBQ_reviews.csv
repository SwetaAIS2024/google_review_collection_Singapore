Daniel Khoo,5,"Good vibes and nice food. The singers are great too, maybe their ear mic need to adjust their voice abit softer if not their voice might clash with the band",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111375937791290028653/reviews
KKT,4,"This can be a nice place to enjoy your meal.
The food was great, environment was good.
Staffs were friendly but still needs to improve in organising the process to handle big crowds.
And also inventory checks to ensure customer's order can be delivered.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
Joey Yong,1,"Around 7pm till 8.30pm ,the food still never come completely, already informed the staff that we still shortage of some other dishes, after informed several time to the staff, the dishes still never shown up , and keep telling us that they shortage of manpower, but the issue is instead of getting the food for the customer, they went up to the stage and do the performance and sing song, and this is what we cannot understand, so at this moment we can’t take it anymore, right after we finish whatever food that we have, we went for the payment and wanted to refund the missing dish that not been serve , but the manager told me that she don’t know how to deduct the transaction for the set meal and she give me 10% service charge discount. The problem is 10% discount is not worth for one portion of pork belly and 2 bowls of rice. And I believe that on that day got a lot customer was very unhappy for their service.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116149756495843775500/reviews
