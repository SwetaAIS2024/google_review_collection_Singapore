敏,5,"Would like to share about this Veg stall located on level 2 in Iras food court! Food is pretty affordable (prolly the most affordable in the whole area) as dishes range from 3.5 to 4.5 depending on what u pick. I really like the 菜饼, its super crispy. They also sell lor mee and zha jiang noodles. The boss is a really nice uncle! Do support him if you are around the area!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114482592434410868814/reviews
