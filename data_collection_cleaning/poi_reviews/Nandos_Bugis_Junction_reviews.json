Though all orders using apps but they still help with questions.\n\nFoods and drinks:\n- the galao is nice especially if you are looking for something non sugar.\n- the new menu honey thigh chicken bowl also very nice. Adequate portion with good sides add ons\n- sweet potato fries just too yummy cant stop once you start\n\nOverall it is very nice and a good option if you are hungry at bugis junction mall.",

      "text": "Nando's Bugis Junction ‚Äì Where Chickens Go on a Diet Before Serving\n\nWe went to Nando‚Äôs at Bugis Junction with stomachs rumbling and expectations high, hoping for a hearty, soul-warming meal. After all, when you‚Äôre forking out $16.30 for boneless chicken thighs, you‚Äôd expect at least, well‚Ä¶ a decent amount of chicken. Right?\n\nWhat arrived at the table looked like something you‚Äôd find hiding behind the lettuce in a sad school lunchbox. The so-called \"chicken thighs\" could‚Äôve passed for chicken thoughts‚Äîsmall, fleeting, and barely there. Blink and you might miss them. Or maybe that was the point: a culinary magic trick. Now you see it, now you're still hungry.\n\nLet‚Äôs be clear. For $16.30, I wasn‚Äôt expecting a whole farmyard experience, but I also wasn‚Äôt expecting appetizers for ants. Honestly, I‚Äôve had more meat fall off a KFC drumstick I dropped on the floor.\n\nThe photos speak for themselves, but just to paint the picture: imagine paying steakhouse prices and receiving a snack-sized portion that would leave even a toddler asking, ‚ÄúIs that all?‚Äù At this point, I‚Äôd have had a more fulfilling experience (emotionally and nutritionally) at a fast food chain‚Äîand still walked away with change for dessert.\n\nIn conclusion: if you're looking to pay premium prices for portion sizes that would make a hamster complain, Nando‚Äôs Bugis Junction is your spot. Otherwise, save your dollars and your dignity. You deserve a meal, not a mystery.",

      "text": "Nando‚Äôs at Bugis Junction is a great spot if you‚Äôre craving flavorful flame-grilled chicken with a spicy kick! üçóüî• Their PERi-PERi chicken is always juicy, tender, and grilled to perfection. You can choose your preferred spice level ‚Äì from the mild Lemon & Herb üçãüåø to the fiery Extra Hot üå∂Ô∏è ‚Äì so there‚Äôs something for everyone.\n\nThe set meals are a good deal, especially the 1/4 or 1/2 chicken combos with two sides üçΩÔ∏è. I personally love pairing mine with Mediterranean rice üçö and grilled veggies ü•¶. They‚Äôve also got PERi-PERi bowls, wraps, and burgers if you‚Äôre looking for something different ‚Äì all customizable and packed with flavor üòã.\n\nThe ambiance is cozy and casual, great for a chill lunch or dinner ü™ëüïØÔ∏è. Service can be a bit slow during peak hours ‚è≥, but the staff are generally friendly and helpful üòä. It‚Äôs usually less crowded during off-peak times, so that‚Äôs the best time to go for a smoother experience üï∞Ô∏è.\n\nIf you love bold flavors and don‚Äôt mind a little heat, Nando‚Äôs is definitely worth checking out! ‚úÖ Bonus points for being conveniently located right in Bugis Junction ‚Äì perfect for a meal after shopping or exploring the area üõçÔ∏èüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.",
