      "text": "Saw a lot of reviews and recommendations for their pancakes. But today I ordered something more rare in Singapore - bean curd with gula melaka (palm sugar)\n\nI had mine as a cold dessert. The bean curd  is silky smooth with good strong taste of tofu. And I must say they added a generous amount of gula melaka, giving it an aroma of coconut and the sweetness imparted dimensions of taste to the bean curd. Give it a good stir, breaking the bean curd to smaller pieces and coating each with the gula melaka, so that the sweetness is not overpowering on some spoonful and bland taste on others.\n\nAt $2 a bowl, the portion is small making it more precious as you savour every spoonful. Sinfully sweet but delicious.",
