Danny Lien,5,The long bone pork ribs was good. Tried the rabbit fish (Pek Tor) and asked for the bigger size one. Was very good as well. Must also try the preserved vegetables. Did not really like the pork trotters as it was little too dry. Good attentive service and reasonably priced. Also a good selection of fish to complement your meal.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112545989610254823192/reviews
Erica Lim,1,"Terrible experience! To be very honest, I wouldn’t even want to give a star to them. The pork knuckle was ridiculously small—nothing like the pictures or description. Definitely not worth the price. After we have highlight to them on the pork knuckle, she return with a bowl of pork and sarcastically said there is enough meat and skin in the bowl. I definitely won’t be coming back for sure. Please refer to the pic I have enclosed this is what they have serve us.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103984531692878430251/reviews
claire jinkies,3,Had the more expensive pork ribs that they charge per piece (shock) and normal pork ribs. Their meat is quite tough though the soup is peppery. Trotters was soso. Didn't try the fish but seems popular. Don't think I will be back.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107652886337982277614/reviews
Mambo G,1,"Very poor BKT. Ordered the most expensive rib at $15 with rice and You Tiao.

But they have one okay rib and one substandard one.

Both meat is tough and not tendered at all, quality is poor compared to SF.

Pls avoid !

The bowl is so small, after 2 spoons the soup is empty.

The only dark sauce served is not the sweet kind.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110772784184045197526/reviews
Dos Ocampo,4,"The bak kut teh itself is okay, except that the meat is quite chewy and not as tender as the other bak kut teh restaurants. The soup, however is very flavourful and they offer top up of it it you want more.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113878842024193042926/reviews
