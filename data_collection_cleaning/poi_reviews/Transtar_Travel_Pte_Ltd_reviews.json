      "text": "A Wednesday 9.30am at Jurong East Pickup to KL. Firstly, it was late for almost an hour. It came this old coach (not with transtar brand), noisy engine, fallen seat cushions, malfunctioned air-conditioning system. Added was driver's reckless driving. We were almost thrown off the seats multiple times posing safety hazards. I had expected Transtar to maintain its standard as a top coach service provider but now it's not. Its crucial during your booking that you are ensured taking a Transtar coach and not one they switch from dishonest practice. Lastly, email feedback to Transtar and there were no reply. Hence, it's better to post here to keep everyone alert of such scenario may happen. It's absolutely not suited for elderly if your trip has any.",
