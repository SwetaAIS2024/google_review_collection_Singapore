A full-on serve. The music was on point, the energy was electric, and the crowd was giving!\n\nSpecial love to Gerald at the outdoor bar — such a sweetheart, super fun to talk to, and his playlist? Baby, we were soulmates. Total slay.\n\nOnly one thing — I didn’t know I couldn’t re-enter after going downstairs for toilet since I didn’t get stamped. Would’ve appreciated a heads-up as a first-timer, but no hard feelings.\n\nOverall? ATE. Will definitely bring my Thai peeps here next round!",
