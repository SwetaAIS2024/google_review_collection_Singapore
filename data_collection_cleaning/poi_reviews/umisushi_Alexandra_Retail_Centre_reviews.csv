Ethan Ong Wee Tiong,3,"Just a quick takeaway, hence nothing much to review on the service or the atmosphere. The assorted maki is so so (as expected for the price). The tamago is quite nice n acceptable for the price. Giving 3 stars for the food since one is so so n the other is quite nice, hence the food rating is being averaged out.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112485984526390357369/reviews
Febrin Lee,1,"Portion is small for the price. Even kimchi was missing. Miso soup was also not part of the meal.  Still hungry even after the meal.

If you're craving for Japanese food I suggest you look elsewhere",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111852309830250621536/reviews
Remus Heng,1,5 pieces of meat is all you get. The voucher food’s portion is so little. You might as well relinquish the store and give it back to KFC that used to exist here.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116968672256258549672/reviews
Audrey Leck,2,10 Oct 2024 ordered thru Foodpanda before 12pm. After 12pm did not show order receive so called up to check. They said order just received so we waited till 1pm. When the food came it was cold. The taste was ok but cold. Hope to see improvement in future.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100311062348455233324/reviews
T N,1,"Wanted to give this place a chance despite the terrible reviews but I should have trusted my gut instinct and spent my money elsewhere.
Horrible customer service from Joan from the moment I walked in and left.
No greeting, no reading back of my order, not even eye contact - just complete silence.

Now I am a F&B manager, been in this industry for 11 years and if she is one of my employees, she will not be on my team. Unacceptable.

Ordered the curry katsu don: curry is slightly sour

Sprite: can’t go wrong with that

No wonder this outlet is empty during dinner time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101050708931658329496/reviews
