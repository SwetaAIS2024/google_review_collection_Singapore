      "text": "Mind blown by the pork noodle; its the traditional Teochew style. The pork liver was perfectly cooked. Good price, $4.80! I almost ordered a second bowl. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nThe lok lok lived up to expectations. The broccoli could be crispier. The mantou remained crispy even when it wasn't warm!\n\nThis place feels like a hidden gem. I was surprised when I came at 7:30 pm Friday night for dinner; there were a lot of empty tables.\n\nThe only problem is there's always strong second-hand smokeüö¨, even though I'm seated indoors. Throughout my whole dinner, at least 30 minutes spent here, the second-hand smoke kept coming in almost non-stop. To the extent that after I left, the cigarette smell still lingered in my nostrils. üòë\n\nThe management should really do something about this. It's not so friendly for families with young children and people who can't tolerate cigarette smell.",

However, I prefer chicken pot because it is more to my liking. Also, the friendly staff that takes her time explaining to us. Will come back again for sure!! Jiayou!!",

This coffee shop was dead and miserable a year ago until Fatty Seafood starts its operation. Food from Fatty is excellent and economical, suitable for family and individuals. The only setback about this place is the lack of management, I guess. The fat drink woman who serves drinks in the evening is lazy and spent most of the time chitchatting. Toilet doesn't even have a mirror and run down compared to other brands of chain-stores.",
