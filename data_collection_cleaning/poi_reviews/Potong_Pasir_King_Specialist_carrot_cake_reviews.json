      "text": "This was my second visit to this stall, as they were closed for business two days ago. This stall is run by an elderly couple who provide excellent service, with the lady boss personally serving your order once it‚Äôs ready.\n\nThey offer a wet version of fried Hokkien mee with good wok hei, but the prawn stock flavor is very mild. The sambal chili is slightly sweeter, reminds me of nasi lemak chili. Unfortunately, the sotong was overcooked, the pork belly was hard to find and the pork lard was inconsistently crispy. Two out of the five prawns which were smaller in size were a bit mushy, possibly due to their quality or being overcooked.\n\nAn average plate of FHM, can come and support the elderly couple if you are nearby.",

      "text": "Updated review: Came during lunch time and brought an egg with me because I wanted more protein in my diet.  Order their $5 portion Char Kway Teow with extra chili. They have no complaints about me bringing my own egg to add on.\n\nAs usual, auntie was very kind to bring my CKT to me. Their CKT is the wet type and  the fragrance of the ‚Äúwok hei‚Äùpunches my palates upon popping into my mouth.\n\nA pretty good plate of CKT. CAN EAT!\n\nOld review: Uncle is just like any grumpy old man. üòÖüòÖüòÖ but he is alright. Auntie is kind and polite.\n\nOrdered the small portion with no sotong, so uncle gave me more prawns, I‚Äôll consider them being pretty generous for $5.50.\n\nTurn out their Hokkein Mee is the ‚Äúwet‚Äù type. Their chilli is on the sweet side.\n\nCan eat again.",

      "text": "Ordered the smallest 5.50 portion of hkm. I would not say this is a legit 100 percent hokkien mee by a purist standards but it is more of a zi char wok hei style kind of hkm. There is little to minimum prawn stock flavour in the hkm but there are plentiful wok hei and egginess taste in it which I sort of appreciates. The uncle did put pork lard in it to further enhance the taste while frying. Prawns and sotongs were fresh. They do not seem to include pork belly strips which I am fine without it. My only gripe with this dish is that they actually use sambal chilli for nasi lemak or economic beehoon kind which is quite underwhelming. Overall, can eat.",
