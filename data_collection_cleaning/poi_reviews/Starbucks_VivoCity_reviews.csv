Gayan Chathuranga,4,"The Starbucks at VivoCity is a perfect spot for a coffee break while shopping or enjoying the waterfront views. The store is spacious with plenty of seating options, both indoors and outdoors, making it a great place to relax or catch up on work.

The staff are friendly and efficient, even during busy hours, and the coffee is consistently great, as expected from Starbucks. I particularly love the outdoor seating area—it offers a nice view and a relaxing atmosphere.

The only downside is that it can get crowded during peak shopping hours, but that’s expected given its prime location. Overall, it’s a cozy and convenient café that lives up to the Starbucks experience!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115580882753025627106/reviews

T T,1,"I only came to Starbucks for my birthday voucher, but was fairly disappointed. The earl grey latte was just a teabag (with microplastics!!) in water and milk, and the yuzu tea was also just a teabag.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105242925887464142210/reviews
