Sarah Grace,5,"even though we arrived slightly later than 8, they gave us happy hour price for the first hour which was so sweet of them!!! and they gave us free snacks and bottled water when we extended our sessions. service was excellent and the ladies at the counter were really friendly. 10/10 would recommend to other ppl

they charge by hour, not by pax too which is a plus for bigger grps.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117304361572697478310/reviews
