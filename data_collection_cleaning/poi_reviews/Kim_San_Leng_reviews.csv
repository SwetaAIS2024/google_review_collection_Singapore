CCS,3,"This could well be the flagship store of Kim San Leng - arguably one of Singapore's oldest, largest chain and successful ""kopitiam.""

It has evolved from a gamble start-up in Yishun Town to a multifaceted chain.

I will always make it a point to ear at this outlet whenever I AK in the area. It offers a good selection of not-so-humble foodstalls.

My favorite ones are: economic rice or porridge, tai seng fish soup, the fish ball noodles and the prawn noodles.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
P S Ang,3,"The coffee is nice but the drink service staff is horrible. Came in the morning and she never ask me what i want even tho i am next in queue to order. As i see she was doing some other drinks so i didnt say what i want. And the next thing she say,‚Äù you must tell me what you want‚Äù in mandarin. Bro‚Ä¶. Before that she was alrdy complaining about a customer at the front for not ordering and kept talking. We will order if you are ready. If you are not ready, how do we dare to order?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101513515216786900600/reviews

jumpmanz,1,Ridiculous expensive economy veg rice stall. Got charged $5.90 for this. Meat is hard as rock and rice is sticky. Avoid at all cost.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113677568135794438089/reviews
Chi Hong Hwang,4,"In this day and age when it is hard to find a good value and tasty economical rice stall, the one here is not bad. The young men behind the counter are fairly friendly. A bit cramped for space but acceptable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103614009093464438172/reviews
