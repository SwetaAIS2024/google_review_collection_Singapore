If you are lazy then go work somewhere else, we all love a job that we can just stand at the counter and not do anything and get paid to do nothing, but you chose to work so please be interested in your job. Its ONE job.",

      "text": "The store assistant was very courteous. That’s why I rated one star. “Sorry the bags for display only” seems to be a common theme/response with Hermes.\n\nHowever according to many people’s experience, you need to buy some “small” stuff like scarfs and store assistant would then show you bags in the back.\n\nIf that’s how this company wants to play/lie to customers, sure, at least make it clear. “Buy a key chain or we show you the door” that’d be fair. If you consider you are super high end and try to prevent normies from buying your stuff. Sure then set the price at 5k per key chain. Then normies don’t go in.\n\nIt’s downright disrespectful to have this type of hidden rule and like I need to beg for your bag?\n\nSeriously this is your corporate visions? Or just want to see two hobos fighting for a sandwich so you enjoy the show? Make your rules clear. Or just say we don’t welcome anyone with networth below $10m usd. SMFH",
