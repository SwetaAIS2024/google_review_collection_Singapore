Ken Peh,4,"Always have my quick fix of fried bee hoon and kway tiao for breakfast here. At this stall, they sell a good variety of choices including black or white bee hoon, kway tiao, fried noodles or fried Maggie mee. They also sell nasi lemak rice by the way. They have a good variety of options to go along as well, including your classic fishcake, luncheon meat, fried sunny side up and many other choices. Recommended for your classic Singaporean style breakfast. Price is affordable and justifiable.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
