The pool is usually not too crowded as well especially during 3-5pm. Overall, it’s a good pool for doing laps. However, I’m not a fan of the mini pool beside the slides, it tends to be quite dirty.",

With the booking system in place, the pool was not crowded, with around 3-4 people using 2 laps.\n\nThe kids’ water play area looks fun - like a normal playground but over water. Do note that each kid above 1 year old needs to have an ActiveSG account and they need to have a slot booked together with adults to enter.",
