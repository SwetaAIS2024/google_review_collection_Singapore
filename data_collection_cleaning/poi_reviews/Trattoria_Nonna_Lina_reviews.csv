Peter Jay,5,"We have been visiting Nonna Lina from 2015 and their food has been outstanding. A restaurant with minimalistic decor but serving food bursting with flavors.
The fresh salad, lasagna, crab pasta and Tiramisu were outstanding. Enjoyed a nice quiet evening and also got some food tips from Simone, their chef üòÄ",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117516116512775155982/reviews
N T,4,"Service - 5 stars
Staff were very friendly and attentive. Thank you!

Complimentary bruschetta
Came with a rye bread.

Soup of the day - seafood bouillabaisse ($30) - 3.5 stars
Slightly on the fishy side for me.

Pappardelle al Ragu Toscani ($46) - 5 stars
The star of the night and simply the best ragu I've had. To be fair I don't eat much ragu and often choose seafood over meat dishes as I find meat too gamey. The sauce was on point - it had the perfect balance of umami, acidity and sweetness that made me keep wanting to eat more. The handmade pappardelle was on the softer side.

Penne al Granchio ($48) - 4.25 stars
I've had a lot of crab pasta and this was one of the better ones. They were so generous with the crab meat there was practically more meat than pasta. The crab didn't taste fishy at all and the sauce was flavourful. My only gripe is the penne - it tasted almost wholemeal and was on the harder end of al dente. I'm not a big fan of penne as well and would personally have preferred a linguine or their handmade pappardelle. The pink cream sauce did get a little jelak towards the end.

Tiramisu ($21) - 3.75 stars
We loved that they gave a Real Slice. I haven't had tiramisu in a while - this wasn't too sweet for me throw my husband thought it was a little too sweet. Could barely taste the alcohol. Tasted more like whipped cream than mascarpone.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103165559486640653412/reviews
Shawn Teo,5,"Perfect! Food was delicious and authentic! Service was professional and hospitable with friendly staff! It really felt like I was being transported to Italy! Love the desserts and pasta, definitely recommend the Tiramisu and the seafood spaghetti. Items are pricey, but 100% worth it! For sure coming again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116266651151303337754/reviews
Cheen the Curious,4,"Pasta prices start from $50+, after GST & service charge. Ask staff about portion sizes. Two of our orders, seafood carbonara & squid ink pasta, were big portions; we could have shared. The olives in Grandma‚Äôs Salad ($45 after GST & service charge) were yummy. So were the complimentary bruschetta",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105728478783564664553/reviews
