Ben Toh,5,"Not sure why overall score is 3.5.
The terminal is beautiful, well designed, check in is clear, easy, fast, immigration is prompt (I use the auto gate though), lots of nice furnishing to relax on, visual stimulation everywhere, nice restaurants, everything you'll need from shops...

If my flights get delayed, there's no other better airports to be stuck in.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107514910859944307288/reviews
