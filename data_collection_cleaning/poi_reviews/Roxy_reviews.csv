Jack Sandys,5,Roxyâ€™s is such a vibe. The staff are incredibly welcoming and know what they are doing. We came in for a cocktail and were treated with on the house mango margarita shots and personalised drinks. Music was 90â€™s hip hop/rap. If your looking for a hideout with great drinks this is the place.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109288762334405811661/reviews
Mavis Chuah,5,"Unassuming speakeasy bar, a bar in a bar concept, IYKYK. Bartender (name: Blackie) is definitely the spotlight for us returning multiple times. Friendly, approachable, good sense of humour and really good cocktails drink. Itâ€™s hit you before you know it! He made a drink with absinthe without tasting like it at all, next thing you know 70% alcohol hitting the blood stream! Canâ€™t wait to go back again!

Their menu has interesting names for drinks ðŸ˜‰",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104586216825658248758/reviews

Amir Ahmedzyanov,5,"Great atmospheric little bar. If you're looking for something not typical with it`s own style, you would like Roxy.
Frieandly staff, cocktails, music (rap btw, just in case). I enjoyed my time there, will return, and recommend it to those who likes speakeasy, not typical bars",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112453909807805554144/reviews
Hieu Huynh,4,"Interesting speakeasy bar inside Miss Fitz.
The bar is very small. Could probably only handle around 20 people during covid times so if you want to go there during peak hours, you may want to make a booking.
Ordered the negroni and it was served on the stop with no fuss. Negroni was well balanced and came with a burnt peel as garnish.
Its worth the visit if you are in the area. May try to return and try something from the menu although the menu generally looked uninspired.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106893398509437158513/reviews
