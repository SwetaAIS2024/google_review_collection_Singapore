Aly Lim,5,"Chris Ho was extremely helpful and super patient with helping me get my new debit card. A lot of other customers were very rude to her which I find very irritating as she was nothing but nice to them. I would highly recommend consulting Chris if there are any issues but if you are impatient or have no clue what you‚Äôre doing, don‚Äôt and just seek help elsewhere",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102010681245144736851/reviews
