Jackie Thang,1,"Well known for claypot dishes.

Totally not recommended for lunch time as stall allows for 'regular daily' customers to call in and order, then 'walk-in' customers will have to wait as long as an hour just to order.

When highlighted to him that this is not a fair queuing system, stall simply replied that he got no choice as these are regular customers.

Well... then perhaps should patronise this stall only if you are a regular.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114576721210569560185/reviews
