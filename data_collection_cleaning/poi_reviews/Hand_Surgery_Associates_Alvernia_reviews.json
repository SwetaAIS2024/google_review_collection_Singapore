Dr. Tan performed surgery on my daughter on 13th December 2024, and we are incredibly thankful for the results. Since the operation, the persistent pain that she had been enduring for 2 years is completely gone, and she is now a happy and healthy girl. Dr. Tanâ€™s professionalism and kindness throughout the entire process made us feel at ease, and we truly appreciate the positive impact he has had on our family. Thank you, Dr. Tan!",

      "text": "Dr Tan Ter Chyan is a top class hand surgeon. The receps and the physiotherapist Xiu Juan at the Mt Alvernia clinic are wonderful. Thank you all so much.\n\nMy mum broke her hand and I sought a second opinion from Dr Tan because he fixed my hand many years ago and helped me to recover 90+% of my hand functions then. He was clear about what needed to be done and was confident of helping my mum to fix her hand despite her old age. He did an awesome job. Xiu Juan was also most helpful and very detailed in helping my mum to recover her hand functions. Thank you very much to Dr Tan and his wonderful team!",
