Tarun Joseph,5,"I've stayed at the b88 for 2 weeks somewhere around November '12. Was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the digs and the services that the staff provide. The rooms are clean, well ventilated and the beds and mattresses comfortable. For me, the most important aspect were the toilets and bathrooms - these were always kept spic and span.
The staff are all young, locals, mostly studying at colleges, and consequently really know their way around town - they're really helpful and super friendly too. If you ever have a day where you don't have much to do, relax in their common area - its the ultimate way to meet new people and make some awesome friends! All in all, a really good place to stay.
This is also one of the very few places in Singapore that i know of that doesn't burn through one's holiday money simply on accommodation costs. Very reasonably priced, it is for the budget conscious (which is, i think 90% of all travelers). Singapore is no longer a rich man's holiday destination. Thank you b88! :)",12 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112313000570280883012/reviews
