Cheng Ki,1,"We ordered salted egg chicken cutlet rice with sunnyside up egg and chicken cutlet noodle. All food was served cold, hard n dry as if they were dished n left aside for a while already... Taste wise was still ok. Lots of houseflies at the counter n cutlery area... Won't visit this stall again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109568992827880943809/reviews
Hung Hao,3,"Ordered a 双鱼汤- fish soup served with both fish slices and fried fish bites. It cost me around $9+. Though the price is a bit steep, I can understand that rental and it being in an “ulu” area demands that it charges higher prices for menu item. So I will not comment on the value for money aspect.

However, I did find the portion size to be a bit on the paltry side of life.

The fish soup was not filled with many ingredients, and the fish slices were a bit too fishy for my liking.

The fried fish slices is my biggest complaint unfortunately. They were mostly like off cuts of the fish, and I barely tasted any flesh and most of it was just fried coatings (or with such little fish that it only tasted like coating). Overall, it did not make for a satisfying meal.

Their menu is extensive, and I still want to try more of what’s available before making a final call. I see that they have different outlets around Singapore so I am definitely willing to try out their other outlets before coming to a conclusion. But so far? This is not a place I will come back to.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112503544637343400176/reviews
Douglas Seah,3,"Food was average but served rather fast. Seems like the shop is supposedly centered on fish given all the photos but they sell a lot of meat, non seafood based food. Mini zhi char concept. Ok for a try but nothing memorable.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107477715700835137855/reviews
Fauzi Mohd,4,Surprised to be able to find good fish soup in Joo Koon. Not overly salty soup base. Everything almost taste fresh and I felt the price is pretty reasonable for the portion given. Coming back to try there Curry Fish Head,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103869021987530566277/reviews
KH Chong,3,"Update 2021: As they expand, their standard has dropped since a year ago. Set meal fish portion is just 3 slices of fish in small bowl of soup, have to order another dish. House flies is indeed an issue.

2020: 5 star - Seafood soup is true to their reputation, thick and tasty with a pinch of wine yet not too milky, comes with two big prawns and fish maw. Fish is really fresh, whether it is in soup or deep fried. Vegetables are grown by themselves too. Homemade chrysanthemum tea and lime juice are surprisingly nice.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108028225713545630861/reviews
