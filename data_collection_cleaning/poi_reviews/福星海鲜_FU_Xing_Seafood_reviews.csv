P Loh,2,"Looking at the last few reviews from 7 months before which were mostly negative and seeing the steady flow of people ordering from the stall, thought will give it a try.

Ordered assam fish head and fried egg with chives. Assam fish head which costs $25 is ok, with nothing exceptional or bad. What irks me is the fried egg with chives. At $8, I would have expected something more substantial than what you can see from the photo. My kids feel that itâ€™s only worth $3 but I think $5 is probably reasonable. Definitely not $8. While it tastes ok, this has marred the experience and one try is more than enough for us.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106500811268054043566/reviews
Lawry S,1,"On 11 Aug 24 around 2040hr, order a yee mee. As shown in a photo given 3 or 4 pcs of vege cut in 1/4, pork slices is dry and the food sucks. Not going to patronise this stall again. Never check Google reviews before dining and after checking the reviews is bad.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106432466847556507220/reviews
Cecilia Bek,2,"Tried their white bee hoon today. Not worth for the price.
Only 5 small clams, 2 medium prawns, and a few pcs of cabbage in a STICKY GRAVY.

However compared to other hawkers, $6 of white bee hoon got squids, clams, eggs, cabbage with a super fresh soup.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117953715097833033573/reviews
