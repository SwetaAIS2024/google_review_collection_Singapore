Th Vo,5,"My son attended this school, and it has been the best experience we've ever had. This school is outstanding, not only for my son but also for many of his friends and their parents who share the same sentiment. The teachers are wonderful, always going above and beyond to care for the students. I have no complaints at all and truly feel fortunate that my child had the opportunity to study here. A big thank you to all the teachers and staff!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104056708183516187797/reviews

Somebody Someone,2,I went there last year. The teachers and discipline master don't care about the rowdy students after a while and if you protect yourself from them you will be punished and reprimanded for defending yourself. Overall the teachers were a 60% percent of the teachers were nice.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107352563447713164357/reviews
raden rahida,1,"My first daughter has been there for 6year(P6) and my second daughter has been the almost a year(P1).. My first daughter has been bullied since P3. It's stop for awhile and continue again stop continue..... worst this year my P6 daughter was physically abused by her classmates twice a week after another, first was girl the next week was boy, my daughter was bullied by threatening words too.. we talk to the teacher incharge and the teacher mentioned my daughter isn't the 'popular kind' in school. So if someone isn't popular it's ok to be verbally physically emotionally abuse???? What a stupid thing to say to the victim parents so ya we make a police report and came down to the school they suspended some of the kids but still they didn't learn anything from that they still badmouth my daughter. And today My P1 daughter was verbally bullied by some P6 student.. Ridiculous.. Poor discipline. They have kids smoking vaping at a very young age and they do it int the school toilet. At a very young age the kids started to have a boy girl relationship.. They can't control the kids, the kids acting like gangster , fighting vulgarity, rudeness mannerless Something really need to be done.. Currently they don't have a discipline master.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100476299330045794140/reviews
