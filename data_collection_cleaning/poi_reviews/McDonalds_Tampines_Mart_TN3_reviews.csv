teo jake,1,"Took more than half an hour for me to get my food, after I'd ordered on the app. Number on the screen was long gone after I'd waited in the store for 15 minutes, but my order was still not ready. Had to ask the store manager about my order twice, before she realized that my order was right in front of her all the time. By the time I'd received my order, my corn was already cold, and the butter was not even melting after mixing.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117329512231472735673/reviews
Quek Gabriel,1,"Was buying fast food this afternoon and the management was rude.
The air conditioning is spoilt. Food also takes over 30 min to serve. When asked about the slow service, the restaurant manager had to make a snide remarks, “Fast food means eat fast!”. Is this how managers are trained in PR?",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107503034174091432/reviews
Tipple Town,1,"On the contrary, I would rate them 5 stars for being the Worse McD outlet in Tampines. Order at your own risk. Food is always delayed. The time spent waiting for your food is good enough to make your own breakfast/lunch/dinner.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104517095360276716949/reviews
Irdina Izzati,1,"My food was prepared within 10 - 15 mins. But I had to wait awhile more as my drinks were still not ready which I find it pathetic as my drinks was already prepared but the staff named flora, took a while to serve me. How pathetic to wait for another 10 mins for 3 drinks.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108422103062327161544/reviews
Skydeep1427,1,Very bad experience and this is not the first time this has happened. Ordered online 20 curry chicken nuggets and 2 curry sauce and 2 honey mustard sauce as provided with the said meal. Reached home and noticed upon opening that only 1 curry sauce was given and nuggets were so dry and hard. Not sure if need to try all take away from this outlet. Bought for my kids and no one was able to chew as they too hard and cold.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117205080110360961014/reviews
