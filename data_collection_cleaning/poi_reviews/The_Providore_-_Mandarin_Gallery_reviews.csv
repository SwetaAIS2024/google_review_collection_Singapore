Audrey Chew,4,"I frequent the place quite often. Service is always pleasant and tonight Eezy was attentive as usual
The restaurant's concept has changed under the new management. I'm not sure how that will evolve over time. The Set Dinner was good value at $99 for 2 pax. One thing i miss is the ice cream sandwich dessert. Please bring it back.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113006445805863339140/reviews

We saw that she was diligent and professional, there must have been great training! It’s great to see hardworking young individuals in this society! Lovely ambience, service and night, will be coming back again!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118004526155178915040/reviews

Bernardine Chiew,5,"Came here for tea time after lunch and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We ordered the tea time set, which was definitely worth the price. The pastries and bakery items were delightful, and their specialty chai latte has always been our favourite. We were served by Eezy, who provided excellent service with a warm and attentive touch. Would definitely come back again. Thank you!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108828332961545789604/reviews
