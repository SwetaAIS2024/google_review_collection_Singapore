The mee goreng still has the strong alkaline noodle taste and the plain prata is not really plain but very oily and with a sweet glaze. At least the chicken briyani is not bad.",

Egg one didn't fare better -- you'd expect the egg to moisten the texture; but no, it was like an overnight piece!\n\nAt much higher price points of $1.70 and $2.70 respectively, there's better value to be found elsewhere (fortunately :)\n\nThe only saving grace is perhaps the teh tarik... and the consistently spicy curry lol.\n\nSomehow, Jln Kayu has lost its shine as the preferred prata place; sadly :(\n\n(Still, I remain hopeful that things will turn around... While I seek out other places to makan...)\n\n#MHTamChiak\n#WhichPrataGotStandard\n#Relegated",
