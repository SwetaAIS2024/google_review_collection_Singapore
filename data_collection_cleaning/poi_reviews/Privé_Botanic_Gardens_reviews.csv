Fab Foodie Swede Malin Nordblom,3,"Nice place to have a drink and some food after a walk in the Botanic Gardens. Breakfast, lunch, dinner or just a coffee and a cake. To be surrounded by the lush greenery while eating is great. A rooster might pop by ;)
Both western and Asian food. Egg dishes, avocado sandwich, pasta, Hainanese Chicken rice and much more. You can sit both outdoors, or indoors where it’s cooler.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107062657007062713328/reviews

Lawrence Huang Xiao Long,1,"Really Bad Experience for the Food served… I have been to Prive at other outlet and it was not bad, but this experience here is really scary till the point that you would be angry at the food

Chicken Burger was super dry and hard even for the meat, is stated Chicken Breast but trust me I was the hardest Chicken Breast my family haven eaten…

The Spaghetti (Pork Belly) was salted at its max level… very Salty…

We order the Crab cake Burger for the kids, the patty was not fully cooked and can still feel the coldness from fridge…

Only thing was the French fries… we like it a lot!!!!! That’s why u see the 1 Star here…",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116393056637460161982/reviews
