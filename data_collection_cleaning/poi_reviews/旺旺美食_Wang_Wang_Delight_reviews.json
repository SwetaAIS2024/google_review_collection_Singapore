      "text": "Alway came here with wife for some keto friendly meal with meat and soup. They serve nice claypot bak kut teh with selection on herbal type or teochew peppery type. The pork rib is very fresh and able to strip the meat of the bone clean without sticking on the bone and so far it has never failed me. The preserve vegetable and braised beancurb skin is a must for us. If u are a Fried pork lard lover must try it out. Tried the Huatiao wine chicken and Braised pig trotter where the meat is very fresh and tender believed to have stewed for long hours.\nThe boss is very friendly and the price is reasonable for the quality. Most important, my wife and myself does not feel thirty after taking their food even empty the whole pot of soup.\nI will still support them.\nThe food quality and service is good. The atmosphere is a bit rowdy as it is a coffeeshop with no air-con. Overall place keep clean and the cleaning uncle is very friendly and nice to makensure all tables are clean.\nüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",

Worst case was the plain rice was not even cooked properly. The only good thing was cheap but i couldnt even eat it & no choice have to throw. Please cook what you know. Dont just anyhow cook it and expect us to eat.",
