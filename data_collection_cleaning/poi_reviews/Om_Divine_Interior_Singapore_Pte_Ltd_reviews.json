They completed the renovation of my altar room in December 2025 and partial in jan 2025 , but since then, I've been trying to get them to return and rectify some issues. Despite numerous promises to come and fix the problems, they've consistently failed to show up, making excuses every time. It's now April, and I'm still waiting for them to make things right. Their lack of follow-through and poor communication has left a bad experience",
