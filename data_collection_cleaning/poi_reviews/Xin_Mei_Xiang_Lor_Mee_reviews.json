      "text": "There was a time when we would make the journey all the way to Old Airport Road, braving the famously long queues, just for a bowl of Xin Mei Xiang‚Äôs comforting traditional Lor Mee. With their recent expansions, I‚Äôm thrilled to see this nostalgic taste becoming more accessible. Just last weekend, I had the chance to visit their Clementi branch. Today, they have grown to six outlets, located in Balestier, Clementi West, Holland Drive, Bishan, Tampines, and, of course, their iconic stall at Old Airport Road.\n\nXin Mei Xiang Lor Mee‚Äôs Clementi Outlet\nIn addition to the classic Lor Mee we know and love, Xin Mei Xiang has introduced a range of creative variations. These braised noodles are now paired with an array of toppings such as chicken cutlet, fish flakes, pork belly, and even scallops. Beyond their popularity with locals, they‚Äôve gained significant recognition, having been featured in the Michelin Guide and highlighted by various media outlets like Makansutra, Shin Min Daily News, CTrip, and Gourmet List.\n\nA quick glance at the menu was all it took to spot our favorites, and we made our decision swiftly as the queue was growing. Here's what we ordered: four different variations of Lor Mee.\n\nI‚Äôm quite accustomed to their signature bowl of traditional Lor Mee, which comes loaded with shredded fish, tender braised pork belly, crunchy bean sprouts, and a flavorful braised egg. All of this goodness is served over yellow noodles, perfectly soaking up the rich, gooey braised gravy.\n\nSignature Lor Mee ÊãõÁâåÂç§Èù¢ - $6\n\nSavor the best of both worlds with a combination of fried and shredded fish paired with braised noodles. This is a great option for those who prefer a fishy twist to the traditional bowl of Lor Mee.\n\nDouble Fish Lor Mee ÂèåÈ±ºÂç§Èù¢ - $6\n\nThe  Lor Mee dish beautifully showcases two distinct types of fish: crispy fried and tender shredded fish, offering a delightful mix of textures and flavours. The rich, savoury braised gravy ties everything together, making it a satisfying meal for fish lovers.\n\nIf you‚Äôre craving something fried, go for the Chicken Cutlet Lor Mee. The cutlet is deep-fried to golden perfection, making it a delicious complement to the bowl of savoury noodles.\n\nChicken Cutlet Lor Mee ÁÇ∏È∏°ÊâíÂç§Èù¢ - $5\n\nThe Chicken Cutlet Lor Mee offers a satisfying crunch with its perfectly golden, crispy cutlet. Drizzled with savoury gravy, it's an indulgent pairing that elevates the traditional Lor Mee experience.\n\nThe Scallop Lor Mee is a premium addition to the menu, standing out as the priciest option. It's a delightful twist on the traditional Lor Mee, featuring succulent scallops that elevate the dish to a more indulgent experience.\n\nXin Mei Xiang Scallop Lor Mee Êñ∞ÁæéÈ¶ôÊâáË¥ùÂç§Èù¢ - $8.50\n\nEager to sample a bit of everything, we added extras like Ngoh Hiong, chicken cutlet, and shredded fish to enhance each of our individual servings.\n\nOverall, the taste was quite satisfying, bringing back nostalgic memories of our breakfast trips to Old Airport Road Food Centre.",

      "text": "I‚Äôve heard really good stuff about the Xin Mei Xiang Old Airport Lor Mee and was surprised to know they have now expanded to 6 outlets. I brought my mum and sis with me recently to check out the Clementi West outlet and we had a sumptuous meal in a clean and peaceful environment.\n\nXin Mei Xiang have won many awards including being included in the Michelin Guide, Makansutra and People‚Äôs Choice Awards.\n\nCraving a bowl of flavorful Lor Mee that hits all the right notes? I love it with a generous amount of garlic, vinegar and chili for the full kick. We best enjoy the thick gravy with abundant ingredients and with a mix of yellow noodles and beehoon.\n\nWe tried the Signature, Crispy Fish and Braised Pork Lor Mee and I feel that the signature gave me the best of every bit. I hope to try the Hakka pork and scallop lor mee next time.",
