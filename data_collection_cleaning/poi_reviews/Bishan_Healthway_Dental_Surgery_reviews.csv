fern fern,5,"Dr Wan is principled and scrupulous - a seasoned and experienced dentist who has been practising for almost 30 years. He’s one of the rare few dentists who does not use an appointments system because he will not turn away anyone who wants to see him. So no matter what time of the day you want to see him, you can just walk in and wait a while. This pales in comparison to other dentists who use the appointments system to control the schedule to their advantage - which Dr Wan is too principled to do. He might be seen as old-school in that sense but old-school morally and righetously just - a rarity in the field.

I saw him based on my husband’s recommendation and he caught a cavity that had been developing for 2 years - that my younger, less experienced dentist had not caught. Dr Wan is truly experienced and an expert professional in his field. He’s direct and straightforward - but clearly excellent at his job.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109582168391485137050/reviews
Maverick Yong,2,"I had a mouth infection, and visit the clinic to get it checked. I appreciate the anti-biotics given to control the spreading, but the referral letter was the issue.

I was given a referral letter to Novena Medical Centre, but in the end, the dentist at the clinic told me that he is unable to help me and say that the referral is invalid. I wasted my trip down to Novena, with the painful feeling i had in my mouth. I had to scramble to find another nearby clinic that was able to help me.

If you were to go to this clinic, just be mindful to accept any referral. Maybe scaling and polishing is the only thing you can look forward to here.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103393950643764277431/reviews
Andy Ong,5,"I was recommended by an ex colleague...it's first come first served concept... Dr Wan did a wonderful job... NO PAIN!  I had my teeth cleaned up here, I'm a heavy smoker and he did a great job. I have been to many dentists so far he is the one with the least pain! lol",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106684686894485405985/reviews
Ong David,1,"Visited dentist with pain in teeth and he determined that a root canal operation is necessary, and referred me to a specialist. Went to other dentists to get second opinion and it is just a minor issue, treatable using common medications. Unsure if it is a misjudgement or trying to get patients to sign up for expensive yet unnecessary treatments.

Do exercise your judgement if he asks you on the spot to sign up for certain procedures!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114446054657904525425/reviews
Angela Yeo,5,"A dentist who is passionate about dental education and does his best for his patients, even though rising costs and laissez-faire attitudes of the public toward their own personal dental care result in an increasing trend of dental loss from gum pathology! Thank you Dr Wan, for caring enough!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109647235288698145254/reviews
