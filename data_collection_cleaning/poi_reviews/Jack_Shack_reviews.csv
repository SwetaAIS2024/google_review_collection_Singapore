You will leave with not just your tastebuds well satisfied, but your spirits deeply filled as well. Too good to be true?

Jane Tee,5,"This private dining gem is for those who cherish the art of intimate, elevated dining experiences.

The star of the show here is undoubtedly Chef Jack’s signature smoked brisket. Flavourful and tender, this is always a crowd favourite.

Then there’s the uni pasta—a dish that’s nothing short of a culinary masterpiece. The delicate, briny sweetness of the sea urchin is perfectly balanced by the creamy, al dente pasta, creating a dish that is both luxurious and comforting.

Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply looking to treat yourself to something extraordinary, this is one dining experience that’s not to be missed.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110897663517633900715/reviews
