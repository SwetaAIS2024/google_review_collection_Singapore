Wei Ern ONG,3,"Got their grilled pork banh mi ($6) & pork rind snack ($3).

The baguette itself was the standout; the exterior crust was very crisp & the interior was soft.

The grilled pork, pate & pickles were average. Good filling to bread ratio.

However, the texture of the grilled pork was crumbly and lacked the sweet-salty flavour punch.

The pork rind snack was great! Crunchy, salty, spicy & sweet. Had difficulty opening the packet & their staff kindly helped me with it.

Was there around 3pm on a rainy weekday afternoon & the coffee shop was mostly empty. The space was clean & well-ventilated with lots of fans. Would not make a special trip down but definitely would patronize again (to try other dishes) if in the vicinity.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100443726692333908509/reviews

Cassandra Whitely,4,"Delicious chicken pho. Baguette was average but crispy enough. Staff were Vietnamese. Hence, they weren't able to fully understand our order, including our request not to add pepper due to an allergy. Overall, it is worth a try if you are in the area.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117740183119393035431/reviews
Timothy Utteridge,5,"Coffee shop Vietnamese (not much of a view or atmosphere) getting busy after 6. Service a bit perfunctory. Food very fresh, not over salted, sauces were tangy, pork succulent. Bread crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. Goes well with a beer from the drinks stall. Recommend a visit.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112984146789151884811/reviews
Yong-khiam Cheng,5,"Banh Mi Be Bi is a stall in a coffee shop in Upper Aljunied, serving up some of the tastiest Vietnamese sandwiches in town. The bread is fresh and crispy, and the fillings are bursting with flavour.

We visited the place for lunch on Monday and ordered grilled pork and beef Banh Mi, beef pho, and spring rolls.

I highly recommend the grilled pork banh mi. The pork is juicy and tender, and it's perfectly seasoned with a blend of herbs and spices.

Service at Banh Mi Be Bi may be a bit slow, so be prepared to wait for your order to be prepared.

Despite the wait, it's worth a visit.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117758155524218325982/reviews
