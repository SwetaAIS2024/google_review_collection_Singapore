Mayank Pandey,5,"Great mall right next to main attractions of Sentosa. Lots of places to eat and drink, and tons of candy shops. It was clean when we visited a few days ago. There are multiple entry and exit points, so didn't feel too crowded anywhere. Maybe a few more seating options on the lower floor would be useful.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107162993305909069490/reviews

Grace Ooi,4,"It was an awesome experience with the merge of art and technology to bring out the life of the painting.

Get yourself in the time when Van Gogh was in, from the painting, feel what he felt. Through the painting, it is easy to feel his strong emotions changing from time to time till he took his live in 1890 at the age of 37.

Hope you could get to see it, exhibition at limited time only.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105307186864222180520/reviews
