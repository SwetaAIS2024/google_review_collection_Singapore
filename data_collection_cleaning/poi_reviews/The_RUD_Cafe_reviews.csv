Selvinia Nofy,5,"I arrived in the afternoon, just after the lunch hour. It wasn't too crowded at that time, although some groups started arriving as I was about to leave. I really love the ambiance; the white decor creates a minimalist and tidy atmosphere. There are plenty of Instagram-worthy spots if you enjoy taking pictures. I highly recommend trying their signature drink—it tastes great!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102676437011264302982/reviews

Emannare,5,"After racing, we feel so hungry. So we had the Lalapot set, 2 refreshing drinks and Tiramisu. The lalapot was so berbaloi for 2, I think can feed more people. Everything was fresh.
