      "text": "The vibe of the place is very pleasant and relaxing. It takes me back to some of the restaurants in Xiamen.\n\nHowever, I would like to highlight two concerns: the food and the toilet situation.\n\nThe food looks amazing, but that’s where it peaks. I wouldn’t say it tastes bad, but there’s nothing about it that justifies the extreme cost.\n\nAs for the toilet, while I’m not expecting a butler or sparkling tiles with elaborate decor, it barely felt like a proper washroom. It came across more like a cement stall with a toilet bowl. In my opinion, it could really use a good cleaning.",

I like the atmosphere.\n\nThe food is good too - especially the steamed prawn garlic vermicelli, pan fried kurobuta pork chop with honey, pumpkin sauce tofu. You can give the fried rice a miss.\n\nThe service is very friendly and fast too.",

Don’t have the exhaust fume smell from the kitchen after 1 hr of dining. Food is great. Service is prompt and food serving is fast. The lady is cautious n only recommend food quantity based on the headcount and will stop you from ordering too much. Roast duck is good, the kurobota pork chop is good. Also love the steam peanut and jambu with lemon peel\nServed as appetiser. Value for money and totally a hidden gem. Need to have car transport or taxi to reach here.",
