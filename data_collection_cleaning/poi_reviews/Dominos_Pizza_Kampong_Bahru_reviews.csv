Caihong,1,"Order came late. Orders sent were wrong. Missing one large pizza!!! Called their outlet multiple times but no one answered. I wrote an email him, hopefully they bother to reply. It was a bad experience because there were not enough pizzas for my event.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105463327165128198550/reviews
Eileen Brennan,2,"I ordered on Grab at 20:33. Left instruction for driver (Dominoes do not use Grab drivers, they use their own fleet) to text/call when he was outside, so we could meet them, as we were in a hotel. Got a WhatsApp from the store at 21:04 the driver was on the way. Got no correspondence from the driver AT ALL, wrote to the store WhatsApp multiple times to receive very little communication back. Also called the number attached to Google about 10 times which just kept saying “call failed”. At 21:52, I eventually received a response from the store, a photo of our food hanging on the outside door of the hotel. The driver just left it there and never told me!! It was only barely warm, so must have been there at least 30 minutes if not more. Driver should hand the food to the person who ordered, not leave food hanging on a door in the street and not even tell the person that it is there!! Food was tasty but almost cold so not as nice as it could have been.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106889057690129885222/reviews
e s,4,"I ordered delivery through Foodpanda.
After placing my order, I checked Google Maps and the Foodpanda reviews.
There were many bad reviews saying ‘it took too long’ or ‘the wrong items arrived.’
I regretted choosing this place.

But I didn’t have to worry.
My order arrived on time, and the food was delicious.

The only downside was that the delivery person ignored me when I greeted him.
I later found out that the delivery was not by a Foodpanda driver, but by a Domino’s Pizza driver.
Except for his rudeness, I was very satisfied.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100446819310577516477/reviews
Trevor Pillay,1,"Worst Dominos in Singapore.
Ordered and never received my order.
Payment was made and no way of refunding which is nonsense.
Stay away from this franchise, I'd rather go to Pizza Hut. That way you get what you pay for, like a pizza in a box, in your hand...",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115903049372144153150/reviews
