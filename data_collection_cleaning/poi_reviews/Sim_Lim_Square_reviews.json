Gaming,computers,MAC, iPhones, projectors, laptops, speakers, headphones, SSD,HDD’s,NAS, AV amps, gadgets in general, or simply need your device repaired on the quick this place is for you ! 6 floors of tech shops catering to all, you could spend a fortune in here if you were inclined, I personally found prices varied but generally were 5/10% below RRP and I didn’t find any counterfeit items but then again I wasn’t looking for them. They had big worldwide brands in abundance, even had on the shelf stock of the 5000 series graphics cards reasonably priced too !, some second hand devices in bulk could be purchased too like commercial grade printers, screens, empty shells of what was working iMacs etc for spares…Not the place at all for your “average joe” non tech guy at all! this isn’t by any means a normal commercial shopping centre.",

Most of the shop staff are helpful and doesn't push sales, business was quiet. Managed to brought a laptop hp elite book at a good price, went down to the food court, lots of nice food, there's also subway and Vietnamese food. Hope to visit there again this week to get more great deal. Its time to help the business there. Lots of great deal on the poster as well.",

If you are going for window shopping, remember eateries are not nearby, you have to walk Infront of street and go to Bugis market for proper food.\nAnd if you are really willing to buy something go prepared n study the rates before going.\nGoing there is very easy and approachable if you are willing to walk, the nearest is Jalan Besar MRT on blue track, otherwise Bugis MRT on green track is also nearby. People coming from Bencoolen on blue track can also reach there.",
