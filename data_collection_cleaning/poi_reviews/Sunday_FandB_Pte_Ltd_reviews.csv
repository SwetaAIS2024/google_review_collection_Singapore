L. Online,4,"Mutton Soup at Sunday F&B coffee shop. AMK locals favorite. Take number first and pay only when you collect the food.
Highly recommend for those who love to eat mutton soup with herbs. Usual waiting time is around 20 to 30 mins. But worth waiting as the soup is very delicious. Close at 5pm.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116620772267484554878/reviews

Ben Ng,1,"Worst.. very stuck-up owner. They accept call in for reservation n kept telling those that walk in to wait. I been there for 1hr plus never see them serve any walk in n jus wait for those who call to collect.
Didn't try the food even i was told is nice.
I won't support such attitude hawker.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111387113204471351249/reviews
