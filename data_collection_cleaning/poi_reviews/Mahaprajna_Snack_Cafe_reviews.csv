YY,2,"Didn’t know if the reviews before I bought them, but granted they were one of the only coffee stalls opened on a Sunday afternoon, there’s not much choices around..

💰 At $3.20 for the 2 drinks, it’s at least a full dollar more pricey versus the other two I tried

☕️ taste wise, we both found it to be super bland, really not worth the money at all..

Unfortunately it’s deserving of a 2 star, would have given it a 1 star if the service was poor - not a stall I would consider returning.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
Lin K,4,Lovely elderly lady selling snacks and drinks. I come here regularly when it's too hot for the sugarcane. It's $2.50 which I think is a bit pricey but I suppose she needs to stay in business. The sugarcane is refreshing.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107661794892998180363/reviews
Sook Hwee Ng,1,This stall is selling very unreasonable price drink and snack. Rojak at $3 very small like small kid portion. Plain water at 40cts food court price. Anyhow sell drink price. Sometimes $1 sometimes $1.30 . They used to sell popiah but hv stop due to unhygienic. 👎👎👎,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111091885017801197178/reviews
