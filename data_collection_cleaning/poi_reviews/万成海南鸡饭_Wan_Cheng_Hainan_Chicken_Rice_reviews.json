      "text": "A gem hidden in an obscure location in Sungei Kadut. Although they are a chicken rice stall, I decided to try their Kway Chap.\n\nAt $20 for 3 pax, I would never expect food of such good quality! The innards and pig skin were braised to the right chewiness and extremely flavourful. I tried the recommended Malaysian style kway teow instead of the usual kway and was pleasantly surprised that it paired well with the ingredients.\n\nThought I didn't try, the chicken and roast meat looks equally appetising! This is definitely a place that anyone should consider to visit if you are in this ulu area where birds don't even want to lay their eggs.",
