Gem Manio,5,"Yesterday I had such a wonderful dining experience! The salad was absolutely delicious‚Äîthe beef was incredibly flavorful and tender, and the vegetables were fresh and crisp. It was the perfect balance of taste and texture. I even drank my salad sauce üòÇ Oh forgot to mention that I love their coffee! Hot long black.

A special mention to Nurul, who was warm, attentive, and made us feel truly welcome. Her excellent service added so much to the overall experience.

We will definitely be back!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112215737428142883509/reviews
S Ong,5,"Eating healthy can be expensive and challenging in terms of flavor. This establishment offers a free black coffee through Kris+ with a $12 minimum spend. I appreciate their food, especially the roasted pork. The salmon, chicken, pumpkin, glass noodles and mushrooms are also noteworthy. The staff consistently greet me warmly in the morning, making me feel more like a friend than a customer. Please continue to provide excellent service to encourage customer loyalty.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103168965374272212112/reviews

XY C,4,"Here‚Äôs where I am whenever I have KrisPay points to expense. I buy the SGD12 Workspace voucher in the KrisPay app with SGD10.50 worth of points in order to purchase the basic lite bowl (SGD12.50). The lite bowl portions are super filling for ladies, eat that and I am done for the day. Their best item is the tofu.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102084721777077961598/reviews
Jennifer Sakaguchi,5,"Great coffee! - I rely on Nurul, Kai, Jack and the rest of the team to get me caffeinated and off to a good start every weekday morning. They know my order without asking, and I always look forward to the friendly banter.  For lunch, the salad lunch is also very good, lots of healthy options- just make sure to go early enough for the best selection.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109614803875621320348/reviews
