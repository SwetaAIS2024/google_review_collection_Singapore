Bubble,5,"Revising my previous review as the place was actually closed for the Hari Raya month - so its actually open now! (As of may 20 2023)

Really nice small spot. Got a bagel with eggs at very reasonable price (9.90) and espresso. Nothing mind-blowing but a relaxed breakfast Coffee is good and staff is very nice. Definitely try if you are around (to change from the Stella near by)  Just word of caution if raining as the rain can get a bit under the tents for some of the tables but nothing dramatic.

*Place seems closed definitely (no of stars not accurate as have not been able to try them). Am at the sailing club nearby and have never seen them opened once, whatever the day and time. Don't think the timing portrayed on google are accurate*",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110177512477433971814/reviews
NUR DIANA ABD KADIR,5,"A rare gem in the east where we enjoyed gourmet coffee and comfort food, at the same time experienced the stunning beach sunset. Alternatively, guests can enjoy a tranquil night out  at this muslim-owned cafe. Lady Boss Ms. Suzy is very accommodating and friendly. Reasonable price, congenial ambience and a hospitable crew. üëçüèª",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102710417593314887897/reviews
