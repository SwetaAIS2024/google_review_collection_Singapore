      "text": "It was a great experience for our family in general staying here .\nThe reception staff and attendant very helpful and welcoming. The rooms are really spacious. Bath tub and separate shower area in large bathroom. Balcony is nice with good view. Provided daily house keeping and amenities refreshed. Generous 6 bottles of waters everyday which is not so common , indeed they are generous...\nThe design is good , notably the tiles near pool area comes with good grip which many hotels missed out nowadays. The package is true value for money with access to bicycle and water slides .\n\nOne bitter point was the neighbor who decided to play very loud noice till 3 am ,that disrupt the sleep . Calling the front office didn't help , they didn't take action.. hotel need to be more strict on such customers who don't think about others\n\nThe surrounding area is good except the duty free shop , families can skip that as there are people trying to use visitors passport to buy from such shops .\n\nThe hotel got nice greenery, very large gym and a small play area as well. The title resort would suit more , than just a hotel",

      "text": "Dear Hotel Management,\n\nI am compelled to bring to your immediate attention a series of distressing issues encountered during my ongoing stay, which have severely impacted our experience and may serve as a cautionary tale for prospective guests.\n\n1. Delayed Check-In and Unprepared Room: Upon arrival on December 23, 2024, at approximately 5:00 PM‚Äîtwo hours past the standard check-in time‚Äîwe were informed that our room was not ready. This delay is inexcusable, especially considering the ample time available for room preparation.\n\n2. Water Supply Failures and Unsanitary Conditions: The check-in process was further prolonged due to widespread water issues, notably non-functional toilets. Despite assurances of resolution by 6:00 PM, our room's balcony was filthy, harboring insects on the bed frame and sofa. The toilet remained unusable, forcing us to endure significant discomfort.\n\n3. Inoperative Room Phone and Service Inefficiencies: Our attempts to request basic amenities were thwarted by a non-functional room phone, necessitating inconvenient trips to the reception. Staff acknowledged awareness of these issues, citing ongoing repairs since the previous week‚Äîyet the problems persist. A maintenance technician's futile attempt to fix the phone left our room dusty with cement residue, which remained uncleaned. Alarmingly, a cleaner attempted to enter our room without proper notice while we were inside, breaching our privacy.\n\n4. Air Conditioning Malfunction: The air conditioning failed to cool the room adequately, despite being set to the lowest temperature, resulting in an unbearably hot night. A staff member's cursory inspection deemed the unit functional, dismissing our discomfort.\n\nThese compounded issues reflect a severe decline in service quality and operational standards, especially during a festive season when guests seek a pleasant stay. The lack of prompt and effective responses exacerbates the situation, leaving us distressed during what should be a joyful time.\n\nWe urge immediate corrective actions to address these concerns during the remainder of our stay and to prevent future guests from enduring similar hardships. Prospective visitors should be aware of these ongoing issues, as they significantly detract from the expected hospitality experience.",

      "text": "I recently stayed at Forest City Marina Hotel, and unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. The room was far from what I expected for a hotel of this standard. The floors were constantly damp and sweaty, making it uncomfortable to walk around. The room also had a persistent moldy smell that made it unpleasant to stay in, especially for someone sensitive to odors.\n\nThe hotel‚Äôs facilities were noticeably rundown. The furniture and decor appeared outdated, with visible wear and tear that made the space feel neglected. What stood out the most was the lack of maintenance in the amenities, which didn‚Äôt align with the hotel‚Äôs advertised luxury.\n\nParking was another frustrating issue. The signage for parking areas was unclear, leaving us driving in circles trying to figure out where to park. This added unnecessary stress to what was supposed to be a relaxing stay.\n\nWhile the location and surrounding area have potential, the hotel itself needs significant improvements to match its advertised standards. For the price charged, I expected a much better experience. I hope the management takes these issues seriously and makes the necessary upgrades to improve guest satisfaction.\n\nI would not recommend staying here until these issues are addressed.",
