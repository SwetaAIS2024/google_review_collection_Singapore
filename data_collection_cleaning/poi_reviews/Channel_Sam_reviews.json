Jia you!",

Thought to have good food at good place, but very disappointed with the food!\n\nI don’t usually put bad review but the dinner I had last night really made my heart pain as it really not worth the price. The only good food is the Erdinger Beer…\n\nFlower crabs over fried\nSambal fried rice not nice\nHofan over cooked n too much dark soy sauce\nWine Lala taste bitter\nFish & chip too much flour\nLamb chop acceptable\n\nWill not visit anymore",

      "text": "Knowing that the review is pretty bad (without looking at the comments yet), I still decided to give this place a TRY and...\nIt wasn't that bad actually!\n\nWhile waiting for the food, I decided to look at the reviews and saw many posts mentioning Abt the slow food, the service and some lousy food... I was so worried of the slow-ness as I was really hungry when I arrived at 11.20pm.\n\nBut first dish (my seafood fried noodles $10) came at 11.38pm...not bad I thot. Then before I was even halfway into that, the other 3 dishes came, vongole pasta ($14), pork satays x 10 ($14), clayfish ($24). Oh yah...and my Erdinger dark ($13).\n\nThe seafood noodles was a tad too salty but it's savoury and some people would have loved it. Not much to shout about but nothing to complain too. My partner felt the vongole wasn't authentic but I didn't come here expecting an Italian style pasta anyway, so I thought it was alright too. The satays were pretty good although slightly overpriced. And the clawfish although not the freshest (you can choose between live and not), the garlic pepper was really good! I didn't even wanted to order at first seeing that it was $24 for 3 pieces as they looked really small in the fridge, but they actually gave us 5 pieces of it instead, which made it pretty value for money then.\n\nThe price of my beer was alright too and with the live band (single solo uncle singing Abit of Cantonese and some oldies) and nice environment beside the waters, I think it's a great night out chilling in the light breeze.\n\nI suspect the management might have some of the earlier comments or for some other reasons decided to improve on their standards. I surely don't think they deserve a 2.8... and even the most critical person taking over my place tonight won't give lower than a 3.5 I can imagine...\n\nSo do come over and give them a try. Disclaimer... I came after 11pm so am not sure how it would be at an earlier time or if they were busier. Order those food which I did, and it shd still be a pretty good evening for u.\n\nOverall, 7 out of 10. I don't mind coming back again and maybe singing a few songs with the companionship of the uncle playing his guitar!",
