The staff were friendly, professional, and made sure I was comfortable throughout. I appreciated how everything was clearly explained, and the whole screening took less than 45 minutes. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a hassle-free health screening!",

Despite my last-minute request for an additional ultrasound check, they went out of their way to accommodate it. Special thanks to nurse Renee, who was super friendly and took the extra effort to ensure the completeness of the ultrasound scan. I truly appreciate the care and professionalism shown and will definitely return to this branch for my yearly check-ups.",

The staff were incredibly friendly and professional, making the entire process smooth and pleasant. This was my first time visiting the Tampines outlet, and I must say, the experience was just as superb as my previous visit to their Orchard outlet.\n\nA special shoutout to Aron, whom I believe is the manager. He went above and beyond by ensuring everything was running smoothly. He personally checked in with customers, updated us on our status, and made sure we were comfortable throughout the visit.\n\nThe level of care and attention to detail at HOP Medical Centre is truly commendable.",
