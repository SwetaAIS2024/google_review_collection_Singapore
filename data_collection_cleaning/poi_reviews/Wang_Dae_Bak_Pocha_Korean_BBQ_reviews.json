      "text": "We tried their new Seoul Butter Pork Belly menu and had the Pocha Duo Set, perfect for 2 pax at $99 (U.P. $109). The set includes:\n\n- Butter Aged Duroc Pork Belly\n- Boneless Prime Ribs\n- Cold Noodle (Spicy or Soup)\n- Kimchi Fried Rice\n- Small Soup – Choice of: Kimchi Pork, Spicy Seafood Tofu, or Seafood Beanpaste\nEverything was so good!\n\nWe also tried their Half & Half Pancake and absolutely loved it! It’s a great way to enjoy two different flavors in one without having to order two separate pancakes.\n\nTo pair with our meal, we had the Yuzu Makgeolli, a refreshing and slightly tangy Korean rice wine with a citrusy twist.\n\nOh, and a bonus, free French fries for kids!and their banchan so delicious!\n\nWith the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff, we’ll definitely be coming back for more!",

      "text": "Came for a simple meal.\nOrdered the saba fish ($20) and soy sauce ($17-18? Can’t remember) boneless fried chicken.\n\nOverall the food is decent, saba fish was fresh albeit a bit pricey.\n\nPortion for the fried chicken was slightly too little given the price as well, but the flavors were there.\n\nSide dishes were good, loved the marinated cucumber the most.\n\nMost memorable part was definitely the service there. Staff were friendly and efficient.",

The pork jowl had a sweet marinade and was perfectly balanced. The set also included seafood tofu soup, Korean fried chicken, and crispy pancakes—everything was flavorful, with the soup standing out for its rich, seafood-infused broth.",

Seemed to be left outside for long.\nThe pancake as side dish is great. Crispy at the outer and inner is soft.\nKimchi  soup is normal, with heavy pork taste.",
