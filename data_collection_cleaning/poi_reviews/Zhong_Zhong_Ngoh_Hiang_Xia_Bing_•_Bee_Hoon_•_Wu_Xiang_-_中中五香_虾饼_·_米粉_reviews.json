I don't usually eat ngoh hiang, but decided to give this stall a try as other stalls are closed in this kopitiam, and it is the best decision I have made.\n\nThe food are freshly fried, biting into the food can already know the oil is fresh as there's no funky taste or dark coloured/charred looking stains on them. Not like many other stalls I tried in SG where the food are re-fried many times and their oil don't know used how long never change.\n\nThe owners, Uncle and auntie are very friendly too, can see that they work very hard and is committed to serve good food üëç price is very reasonable also for the food quality served\n\nOverall 10/10, thumbs up will definitely come back again",

Visited this stall three times and the variety offered and taste were consistently good. Loved their non-spicy pink sauce which was nice and yummily sweet. The lady stall owner is always so friendly, almost like a long lost friend. I found their prices reasonable - 5 items for $7.20; 6 items for $11; 7 items for $13 and each of my takeaways included meat and shrimp choices but without bee hoon. Definitely my go to ngoh hiang stall when craving hits. üòä",
