Cheryl Chan,1,"The classes are not very well organised. Basically students queue up to practice drills for the session, and when competent they will be allowed to progress to the next level. But the ratio  is 1 instructor to 15-20 students. Also as an added “bonus”, there is a chubby instructor (who is not even wearing skates) who will shout condescending comments at you for motivation/embarrassment when you fall down. Join at own risk. I guess you pay for what you get.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109960018667411549379/reviews

Brigitte Tan,5,My kids enjoy themselves during lessons. Instructors are patient and dedicated. Punggol park offers a conducive environment and allows the children to further hone their rollerblading skills as they go around the park sometimes with their instructors. Rates are reasonable and standards are high.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105397797446480429778/reviews
Zoe Jane,3,"Attended a trial class on Sunday morning and there were at least 20 kids and only a few instructors. Understandably, , more attention was given to the children. The instructor only came to our group of adult learners 30 mins after class started, did some demos and scooted off. Class size is too big to get sufficient attention. Wouldn't recommend if you want enough attention and instructions to at least pick up fundamental skills.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114978868959043312927/reviews
