kotsakos Jimo,5,"Great competitive club( YCL, ESPZEN, SINGA CUP, BORNEO CUP,) for ages 7-17, all my 3 loving ‚öΩÔ∏èkids,  joined 6 years ago when TURF FC was based at TURF city rainforest pitches, and enjoyed every minute of it, now they are at balestier cricket club, in a beautiful NATURAL GRASS pitch,

PLUS the really good joining point ‚Äî->> is the overseas PRE-SEASON training for 2 weeks mainly in europe( Athens, seville, belgrade, prague etc) where the kids get to enjoy friendlies with well established teams from top level‚öΩÔ∏è

Valentina Biavati,5,"""I would like to highly recommend TURF CITY FC.  The training sessions are top-notch and the coaches are dedicated and knowledgeable. The team has a positive mindset and creates a supportive and encouraging environment for all players.
