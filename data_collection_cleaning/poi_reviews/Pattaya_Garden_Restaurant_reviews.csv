Lauren Yang,3,"I recently visited Pattaya Garden Restaurant and while the experience was good, it didn't fully live up to the expectations. The price was a little on the higher side considering the quality of the food. The green curry had a nice depth of flavor but wasn‚Äôt as aromatic or spicy as I would have liked. The tom yum soup was decent but lacked the strong kick I typically enjoy.

One positive was the fact that they offer halal options, which is great for those who need it. I also saw that they provide catering services, which could be handy for larger events. The omelette was good, fluffy, and tasty, though not spectacular.

While the pandan dessert was a nice touch, it didn‚Äôt have the intensity of flavour I was expecting. The prawn dishes were decent, but not particularly noteworthy.

In terms of value, it felt like you were paying a bit too much for the portion sizes, especially considering the taste didn‚Äôt blow me away. Overall, it's a solid option, but I would only return if I‚Äôm in the area or looking for halal dishes specifically.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109429727563301518623/reviews
Jarome Ng,5,"When my friend Jun told me that their Pad Thai was one of the best he ever had. I doubted him greatly ü§îü§î

After reading through the review by another reviewer D. boey, I formed a good impression and wanted to try it for myself ‚≠êÔ∏è

Lo and behold, I tried it myself and I am glad to say that it was one of the best Pad Thai I ever had!! Keep it up üëçüëçüëçüëç

I am going to bring my friends here too!

Jade Ong-Patzwald,4,"Food was pretty good for the price. The Green Curry is really rich and coconut-y. The omelette (I got with onion) is simple but yummy as well. The Pad Kapow was a bit disappointing though, as it doesn‚Äôt taste like Pad Kapow. Overall, would go back.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104121066061813225975/reviews
