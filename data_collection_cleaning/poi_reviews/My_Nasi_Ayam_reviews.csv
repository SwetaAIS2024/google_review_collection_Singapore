Firdaus Mahat,1,"Im soo not gonna return to this shop. Ordered Steam chicken rice L-$5.50. They gave roasted. When i told the Aunty they gave wrong order, she took back the plate of chicken and just remove the skin.. The reason I ordered steam is because of the skin.!! End up im left with dried breast part with no skins… Damn upset.!!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102815924331162542201/reviews

Loki,4,"2023 update - roasted chicken still tender and juicy, chicken rice still tastes great. $4.50 for a small plate, perfect if you’re a small eater. If not probably gotta get a second helping.

Really love the taste of their chicken rice, even though it’s expensive and the portions are small.

Used to see long snaking queues before Covid, but not so anymore. Still good though, just more expensive.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101937176024039442948/reviews
Gopi Bala,5,"It had been about 3 years since I visited this food centre.

I decided to try the chicken rice.

The rice had great flavour and the roasted chicken was also delicious. The chilli paired well with the chicken, and the soup was tasty too.

Service was also polite and efficient. I would say that the chicken rice here falls into the top 5 chicken rice that I have tried island wide.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114775727475904526433/reviews
