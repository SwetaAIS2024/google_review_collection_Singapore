Shilpa Marigold,1,"Worst experience buying Gucci shoes, i bought it from Singapore airport there I tryed shoes one pair fitted me ok which was 35.5 and told sales person to pack it now that person packed one 35.5 and one 36 size and that also both left feet shoes….. super annoying, who will do this ????? And in  brand like Gucci REALLY??????
Now when I called in customer service Gucci do you know what they answer?
They told me yes it’s our mistake we got all proof and stuff but you have to come to Singapore for exchange
Now I am from India
And they are calling me to Singapore to give exchange
Really should we trust this brand ??
I have 5 pairs of Gucci’s shoes and number of bags but such a big disappointment
What should we do in this case ??
Please suggest",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107129995509602596784/reviews
