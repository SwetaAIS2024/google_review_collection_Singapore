Zhengjie Ong,2,"Exorbitant price at a food court - might be due to the rental. Decided to give them a try given that their main outlet has good reviews.
Food was a sore disappointment though. Ordered the chicken buah keluak udon at $11. Chicken portion was pathetic with a hard boiled egg and a small bowl of udon. Chicken wasn't flavorful and when mixed in with the wet udon, it tasted diluted.
Taste wasn't good, portion wasn't enough. Expensive.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115649171861081488851/reviews
