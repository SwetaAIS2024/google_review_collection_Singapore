lynn,1,"This place is gonna give the people of Hougang diabetes ðŸ¤¢ Donâ€™t think you can choose your sugar level - I asked for 0% sugar and was told that the milk tea is already sweetened. I still went ahead with my order of Peppermint Milk Tea, and ended up with a crazily sweet drink that made my face scrunch up on my first mouthful. Couldnâ€™t finish it and had to throw half of my drink away.

The pearls were good though - very soft and chewy.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113035353984436054163/reviews
Joy Teo,4,I love this place. Affordable and the bubble tea and milkshakes are not bad. I can get flavours here that I can't get at established chains - perks of being a small shop (flexibility). I like their mocha earl grey milk tea with pearls SO GOOD. My boyfriend likes the banana ice cream milkshake.

vila,5,"This is one of the best bubble teas I've had and I mean it quite literally, koi, liho and other big name bubble tea shops couldn't compare to this old school bubble tea shop. They have a wider range than most bubble tea chains and every single one of their drinks tastes amazing.ðŸ¤— i jus wished they opened longer",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107640528500149287662/reviews
Wendi Chan,5,"Joy and Jillian have amazing recommendations based on individual customer's preferences. Often times they follow up with customers on their recommendations if the customers try them.

Peach Mango smoothie with yoghurt bursts is my favourite drink that I would personally recommend if you like something fruity sweet and slightly sour.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101739911502974476961/reviews
