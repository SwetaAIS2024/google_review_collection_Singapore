Kim Woodward,5,"Best school ever: LOVING, NURTURING, LEARNING, and ENGAGING.

My kids loved all their teachers @Alphabet. They also loved Mrs. Cat who watched over everyone at the school. My kids were so happy there that it broke my heart when we left - due to moving.  My kids still talk about Alphabet and their teachers. I remember my kids used to come home and tell me about the brain: ""Mom, did you know the brain helps you think?""  And I would hear them sing songs and tell stories that they learned from Alphabet: ""Run, run as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the Gingerbread man.""

This school gave my kids everything I was looking for and MORE!  Thank you for everything. ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107799610209666369382/reviews
Marina Kortseli,5,"Within a few minutes from Somerset MRT and central Alphabet @ Somerset provides daycare and learning in an excellent, safe, clean environment. It has a spacious outdoor playground where the kids can play, learn and explore new things through various activities. The teachers and staff are always friendly and helpful, and I appreciate their focus on safety and the care they provide to my kid daily. It gives a balance of play and learning and a positive influence that makes your kid thrive — highly recommended.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112121402274587113216/reviews
Shirley Peh,5,Nice campus with a spacious private outdoor play and water play area. Teachers are very caring and meticulous. My kid and his friends are notably happy to go to the school everyday. Location is very central and convenient as well with the Somerset MRT just around the corner. Highly recommended for parents looking for a more intimate schooling environment!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115316279309244998427/reviews
Kate Geraghty,5,"Both my children went to Alphabet (my youngest is still there) and the teachers are outstanding. I can see the care they have for all the kids, and every staff member seems to know the names of all, even if they are not their day to day teacher. The curriculum is a great balance of play and learning, and my children have spent years there running in and out every day with smiles on their faces.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116595945964709406281/reviews
