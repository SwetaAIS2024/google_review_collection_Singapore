      "text": "Dropped by Whiskdom Galaxy at Fusionopolis and tried their cookie, brownie, and a bagel‚Äîand wow, the portions do not hold back.\n\nThe bagel was massive and super satisfying‚Äîcrusty on the outside, soft inside, and packed with delicious filling. Easily a meal on its own. Their cookie and brownie were rich, indulgent, and everything you'd expect from Whiskdom‚Äôs famous bakes.\n\nOnly downside? The shop had a bit of a burnt food smell lingering inside‚Äîmaybe from recent baking, but it did take away slightly from the otherwise cozy experience.\n\nRating: 4/5 ‚Äî fantastic bakes and hearty portions; just hope the ventilation improves a bit.",

My bagel (shrooms melt) was 1. Cold in the middle, 2. Cheese was not melted. The only thing that was ok was the tater tots\n\nThe coffee options? My $7 oat white came looking as per my picture. Couldn‚Äôt be bothered asking for a change as I was so appalled that the barista thought this was acceptable to serve to a customer. Easily the worst presented coffee I‚Äôve had in Singapore.",

Staff made it to order behind the counter, like the beef wasn't pre-prepared, they took fresh raw beef and cooked it in a pan- nice but probably a long wait during peak hours. My request for no onions was entertained. The bagel is soft and brioche-like. The taste was alright but nothing amazing.",
