Very spacious aisles and the high ceiling makes the air better.  There‚Äôs good variety.  No butchery counter, so the slice meats are in the fridge.  Good that there is free 1 hour parking to pick up groceries üëçüèª",

      "text": "Needing last-minute festive groceries on Chinese New Year's Eve, I ventured into the newly reopened Cold Storage at Chancery Court, unsure of what to expect. To my delight, the store was blissfully calm, a welcome respite from the usual pre-holiday chaos.\n\nI was immediately impressed by the wide selection of groceries, including a fantastic array of festive offerings. The aisles were bright, spacious, and easy to navigate, making shopping a breeze.\n\nBonus perk: A coffee kiosk within the supermarket was a lifesaver, offering a much-needed caffeine boost amidst my shopping spree.\n\nI'll definitely be back soon!",

Didn‚Äôt reply me when I asked for help at the self check out and when I repeated my request for help, snapped at me saying she‚Äôs in the middle of something and she‚Äôs the only one there.\nA previous time when I asked where to find something, a very unhelpful staff replied, ‚Äúover there‚Äù! Which did nothing to help me locate the item.\nDisappointing because the previous staff there before the reno used to be very pleasant and it felt like a warm neighborhood store. Please bring back the old crew!",

      "text": "had a bad experience and would like to extend my apologies to the bespectacled burmese man in the hoodie who checked out my groceries. there is one hour free parking, i entered at 2220H, and checked out at 2308H but due to some cashier error, i had to check out a second time at 2320H. unfortunately the one hour free parking grace period elapsed and i was charged $3.50. after haggling and bargaining for 20 minutes, he compensated me with a box of ice cream.\ni am so disappointed that there was no petty fund available to resolve the issue simply and quickly. i really hope that the compensation isn‚Äôt out of his own pocket.\nplus points, supermarket is quite large and well stocked. ample parking very close to the supermarket doors. good discounts w UOB credit cards",
