Zhao Yui,5,"Hidden gem and my go-to spots for a drink!ü•É
Japanese + Hollywood vibes = Kill Bill style
Drinks are wonderful, as you can choose from mild to strong based your tolerance.
Favorite drink is Small Blessings, and Vesper(VERY STRONG, but has a longing taste).",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107431133982204392495/reviews
Geoff Holmes,5,"Great place to chill and chat.
The innocuous glass door to Gibson and Live Twice leads to a small modern Japanese themed bar on the ground floor.
Great service for cocktails and a small selection menu, great environment.
Ideal to go chill, chat, have a drink and light food options to go with it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105345467013700293642/reviews
YC Ng,5,"Live Twice is a fantastic spot for cocktail enthusiasts and fans of Japanese cuisine. Upon entering, you feel like you are transported to mid-century modern Japan with its elegant ambiance and moody lighting!

The atmosphere is vibrant yet intimate, making it an ideal place to hangout with friends or a romantic evening.

The service was impeccable. The staff were friendly, and diligently topped up our water and snacks.

Overall, Live Twice is a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy high-quality cocktails and Japanese-inspired dishes in a charming setting.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114616404937921117862/reviews
Melissa Eisner,5,Great spot for cocktails and little bobbles. I had an amazing old fashioned that tasted amazing. And the little croquettes were scrummy. Great atmosphere in this place as well. Highly recommend!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117316308946167178763/reviews
Jesryn Brooks,3,"If you're looking for a place where cocktails are decent but the attitude is the real star of the show, this bar might be for you. We were there few days ago and the drinks were pleasant enough, though nothing exceptional for the price. The service, however, was where things really stood out‚Ä¶ unfortunately not in a good way.

Apparently, dress codes here are silently enforced by how nicely (or not) you‚Äôre treated. Coming straight from work in less-than-party attire, we were clearly not part of the ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù crowd. One staff member graced us with her presence long enough to spill water on my wrist and, in a bold customer service move, didn‚Äôt bother with an apology or even basic acknowledgment. I guess I should‚Äôve taken the hint and brought sequins.

In short, great place if you enjoy cocktails with a splash of cold shoulder. If you‚Äôre dressed to impress, you might get a smile too!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107561755620954178933/reviews
