erivia tay,5,"Joining this tuition was the best choice i made. I was failing my science in p5 and that was when i joined this tuition and her teaching was very understandable and i end up passing my science. In secondary, I was failing quite badly for my emath getting f9 and E8 but thanks to teacher jody, my emath started passing with an A1! Teacher jody's lessons are all very very fun and very entertaining. She is very easygoing which allows us to ask her questions that we dont know without a worry. She explains all questions thoroughly and patiently! This makes me believe that i will get good grades for emath!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108149412837474564373/reviews

enqi lim,5,"before i join the tuition centre, i was really really struggling with amath and emath(failing). i decided to ask my best friend about her tution centre and ended up coming here. i have no regrets and glad that i have joined! teacher jody is extremely patient and will always answer my queries whenever i needed help! she is able to explain each and every question in a clear way which really helps me to understand the solution of the question! Her lessons are always fun and chill which makes me look forward to going to tution. Along the way, I find myself slowly improving and i started passing my emath and amath. Surprisingly, through the tution, I found myself liking amath more(hated it). Hopefully ü§û I am able to get A2 for amath and emath for olevel!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116626131231669675812/reviews
