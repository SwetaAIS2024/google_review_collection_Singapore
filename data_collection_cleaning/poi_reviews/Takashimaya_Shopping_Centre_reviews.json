There are staff stationed at the entrances to issue umbrella bags so that the mall remains as dry as possible. I was attracted the the bags and the sincerity of the auntie at Sogeum and is now a proud owner of two bags.",

The store also has a really great food court in the basement.",

      "text": "This is a review of Takashimaya and Ngee An City all together, as most of us associate Ngee An as Taka.\n\nIt is a rather old shopping mall in orchard.\n\nNotable mention is :\n1. In one section, it houses many top world  fashion brand boutiques.\n2. If you like Japanese eatery, go to Basement 2\n3. It has a very large  event hall in basement 2 ( Takashimaya Square)\n4. Occasionally having  large outdoor  event at ground level ( foto shown an event car at ground level at Ngee An Civic Center)\n5. Lot of restaurant at level 5 and 4.\n6. Taka has dedicated taxi stand. Ask the concierge for exact location as it is not at ground level.\n7. You could go to Orchard MRT through underpass link to wisma atria then arrive at the station",
