Waste of time and money.\n\nI went down for a cold and only got sore throat medicine, despite telling him I had a fever as well. No clarification asked on coughing, phlegm, etc. the next day, I started developing these symptoms and had to visit another doctor for more medicine. I have the feeling that this doctor treats us like we only want MC.",

      "text": "I recently had a fantastic experience with the dental service provided at Lee Dental. From the moment I walked in, the staff greeted me warmly, making me feel comfortable and at ease. I didn't have to wait long before being called in for my appointment.\n\nThe dental hygienist was extremely professional and thorough. They took the time to address my concerns and provided valuable tips for maintaining good oral health. The dentist, Dr. Lee, was equally impressive. They were friendly, knowledgeable, and took the time to explain the results of my exam in a way that was easy to understand.\n\nThe dental clinic is small, but is equipped with modern technology, which gave me confidence in the quality of care I was receiving. The entire team seemed genuinely passionate about their work, which reflected in the exceptional service I received.\n\nOverall, my visit to Lee Dental exceeded my expectations. I left feeling confident in my dental health and with a positive impression of the entire team. I highly recommend their services to anyone in need of top-notch dental care.",

My wife is very phobia when it comes to injection. Dr. Lee will calm her down and give her confidence.\n\nYesterday, my daughter also went for her treatment by Dr. Lee. She was very pleased with her treatment by Dr. Lee and his dental assistants.\n\nDr. Lee not only treats his patients with care, passions, and warmth. His receptionist is equally friendly and helpful.\n\nI would strongly recommend Chia and  Lee Medical and Dental Clinic.",
