      "text": "I have been visiting this clinic whenever my child is sick as I always had a good experience with the doctors. Especially Dr Mohan who was very patient with children and he was also very knowledgeable and professional. However, my recent visit was a nightmare. The doctor who was on duty that day; Dr Vincent Oei seems very inexperienced in dealing with sick children. My child was crying and instead of trying to calm her down or at least wait for her to calm down, he just forcefully tried to hold her hand down several times to put on the oximeter. He also forcefully tried to put in the tongue depressor twice to check her throat, causing her to gag and vomit thrice. He still wanted to prescribe medicine for vomiting when we told him my child didn‚Äôt have any prior vomiting episodes. It was all caused by him and no apology was given. He just bothered about cleaning himself up. Hence, I would suggest that if you have a sick child, please do call in to check who is the doctor on duty. If it is Dr Vincent, I would suggest you go other clinics unless you are desperate. Dr Mohan deserve a 5 stars but this is based on my poor experience.",

He has a remarkable ability to explain medical information clearly in simple, layman terms, which made it easy for me to understand my diagnosis. Even when the clinic is crowded, he takes his time with each patient, showing genuine care and attentiveness. His professionalism, patience, and dedication truly stand out. I‚Äôm very grateful for the excellent care I received.",
