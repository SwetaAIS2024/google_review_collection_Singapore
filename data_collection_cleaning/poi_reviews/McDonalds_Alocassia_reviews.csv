Henry Eng,1,"Experienced the service here twice. Once dine in and once through delivery. For dine in, i used my voucher to claim the ice cream but they did not give it at all.

For delivery, it was not scheduled long past delivery time (almost 30 mins after). U need to call in to check with them then they schedule it after booking on mcdonalds app.

C,1,"(1) Waited over 35 minutes noticing folks that come after me got their food first. When checking with staff, they claimed they need 5-mins for pineapple tart. Then after 5-mins another staff claimed need another 7-minutes. Hello? I‚Äôve waited 35 minutes for a ‚Äúfast food‚Äù? Averagely even restaurant need only 15-20mins to prepare a steak. What are you guys doing?

This is when it‚Äôs not even busy when we first arrived! A large group came after we seated for 25mins, became super noisy. They got their food first. Noticing an issue, I approached the counter that‚Äôs no one is there.

Staff not well trained, some bantering and goofing round.

After 45mins, I changed my order to take away. My order of double prosperity burger, large fries and pineapple tart, was given to me after 50 mins of wait. No apologies given. My burger and fries was at the counter waiting for pineapple tart for close to 50mins.

Fries quality dropped so low it‚Äôs not even close to McD‚Äôs fries standard.

I live nearby and reach home in 5 mins. My prosperity burger is cold, and fries soggy. I rather go to the next worst McD outlet - Caltex. That‚Äôs how terrible this outlet is.

Worst McDonald outlet. Management please review your franchisees. The variances in services and food quality is noticeable.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109503567716314217697/reviews
Corswain,1,"Ordered multiple times from this outlet via drive through or delivery.
