Debby Teo,5,"Retro theme, played nice Cantonese songs. Food is good. We had truffle char siew bun, emerald salted lava bun , siew mai har kao, wanton and pork chop noodles.  I would say all is good, worth the try and calories! Highly recommend this place.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114906021047307129695/reviews
August Yang,4,"I happened to pass by and found the menu intriguing. We ordered the lemon chicken rice and a salted fish meat patty rice. The lemon chicken was overwhelmingly sour, lacking the expected balance of sweet and sour flavors. However, the real surprise was their tea—smooth, well-brewed, and free from the harsh, over-steeped bitterness often found elsewhere.

The ambiance, though lively, felt somewhat cramped due to the tight table arrangement. Service-wise, certain corners of the restaurant seemed overlooked, with waitstaff occasionally missing diners in less visible spots. A bit more attentiveness in these areas would enhance the overall experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110433417533008386290/reviews
xy,5,"Great food and service! I especially love their polo bun and Arabica coffee—absolutely delicious. The serving speed is impressively fast, making it a perfect spot for a quick yet satisfying meal. The store's HK-style design adds a unique charm, making it a cozy place to enjoy with family and friends. It's also a fantastic spot for taking photos and soaking in the lively atmosphere. Highly recommend!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102806183583302740365/reviews
Blue Fish,3,"Happened to pass by this dim sum place located on 2nd floor hence easier to miss.

Food was ok, nothing spectacular.

Service was prompt, average.

Ambience was a throwback to 80s, 90s with accompanying Cantonese music. Was good!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106067155540962545159/reviews
Sin Hui,4,"visited this restaurant during holiday, expected to wait for a seat. Food was ok, not impressive, but decent.

It’s located on the second floor, which could pose a safety concern, especially for elderly guests, as the staircase area gets crowded with people going in and out.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114163106595567940090/reviews
