Hassle free.\n\nAfter lots of consultation with me, Jeff then bought a new bike on my behalf. Made edits specific for my requirements and had it delivered and built at the shop.\n\nOn collection day I was able to enjoy a lovely breakfast and coffee before riding home. An excellent experience.\n\nI've added the shopping basket....",

      "text": "Came in to do a quick tune up for my rear D and met with Jeff who was enthusiastic to help. Although he was working on another bike, he was happy to address my concerns and he did an exceptional job troubleshooting. My brakes were a little “squishy” and had too much play so I opted to also get my cables changed along with a new set of carbon brake shoes. There is a waiting area with very reasonably priced drinks and I had a nice life cold bottle of Stella while waiting. Bike rides like a dream now. Overall very happy with the service and experience. Will most definitely recommend Bike Craft to others",
