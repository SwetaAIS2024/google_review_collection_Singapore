Nurul Suzulyana Zulkifley,5,"This is a fantastic place to enjoy iftar with family during Ramadan. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, making it a perfect spot for a gathering. I was truly impressed with the menu, offering a great variety of delicious dishes. The highlight for me was the kambing bakar‚Äîit was tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Asam pedas claypot also.. woahh the best üëçüëç

The overall dining experience was excellent, and considering the quality of the food and service, it‚Äôs definitely worth the price. Highly recommended for a satisfying and enjoyable iftar!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106552691921007716622/reviews

Chan Ee Ren (Jacky),4,"Went for a wedding dinner, foods are OK, atmosphere are good enough for a wedding dinner.

Design is a little old fashioned and the lights in the middle is blocking the view of the married couple from last row.

Over all, is quite a nice place to have a wedding dinner.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100703314258664333961/reviews
Bian Lee,3,"The course is in good condition. Challenging layout with many sand bunkers at strategic locations to test golfers‚Äô course management skill and accuracy. The green is very fast, just one light tap and the ball rolled a long distance. It‚Äôs buggy on track, hot to walk for afternoon flight. Our caddy is not effective, would not search ball for us, read the wrong line during putting and made mistakes in fetching the correct club. And we were told to tip the caddy by a fixed amount, not by the standard of service she provided.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106963842817729813226/reviews
