Sharon CM Poo,5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Tried El Brasa at the hawker and wow, the food was amazing! I had the Mentaiko Fries, Rib Eye, and Samyang Prawn Pasta—all were super shiok!

The Mentaiko Fries were crispy and loaded with flavour, the Rib Eye was juicy and tender, and the Samyang Prawn Pasta had a nice spicy kick with fresh, juicy prawns * perfect if you are samyang ramyeon lover 😍

Affordable, delicious, and so worth it. Definitely one of the best hawker stalls I’ve been to. Will be back for more!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106376869641436344519/reviews

Order chicken chop $7.90 at 7.05 pm, ready at 7:11 pm, the queue start longer behind mine.

Their lettuce 🥬 is very tasty,  it added lemon juice with a sweet note which is very refreshing.
Although I don’t like heavy sauce, but the herbs sauce for the chicken blend well, not over spicy .
The pasta is well cooked & tasty.

Overall the volume & qualities worth the price to paid.

Highly recommended 👍👍

I am hoping they will served breakfast set meal someday soon. 😄",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104017026296774707444/reviews
D,2,"Ordered their Forager Burger ($12.90) with a side of pulled beef fries (additional $2).

The burger patty was not grilled, it tasted rather disgusting like it was steamed. There was a weird aftertaste from the patty as well.

The pulled beef fries tasted decent, but the beef was slightly tough and the amount of meat on the fries was very little.

Would not recommend this particular meal combo.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102851447835762281764/reviews
Rusty Muhd,5,"Purchase Pasta 🍝 for Takeaway. Food tastes Nice, Just that the portion of the pasta is small and little or did they accidentally swap the portion side with the meat side? 😂😁 We're hoping to see more improve on the takeaway portion area perhaps.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116018017369183017484/reviews
daryl koh,5,"New stall at bukit batok's new hawker centre. Extremely affordable western food options. Portions are huge and food was amazing.

I ordered their ribeye set and samyang pasta and definitely was not disappointed. The beef was cooked well and dishes were flavourful.

Definitely worth trying if you are there.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102905386113999693578/reviews
