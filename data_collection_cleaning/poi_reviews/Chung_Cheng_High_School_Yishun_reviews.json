      "text": "Jeez louise, goodness gracious, there is definitely room for improvement, throughout my years in this school, i have truly felt like a NPC (non-player-character), everyday is truly a bore and i feel like im living in a simulation. There are not many activities organised for the students to enjoy themselves and not many learning experiences (learning journey etc) like other schools. There is also a small variety of ccas to join (i think only got like 20). When you ask other school student ah whether they regret coming to whatever school they went to they prob say yes one but this school majority confirm say NO.\n\nIf you plan to go to a school in this yishun area with similar grades, definitely go to yishun town, it would be awesome sauce, all the people i know there ah, very happy one and their grades are all decent one also.\n\nChoose wisely ah\n+ pic of cchy student for fun",
