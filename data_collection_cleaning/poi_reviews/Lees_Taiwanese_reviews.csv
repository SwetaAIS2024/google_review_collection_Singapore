Samuel Lam,4,"Nice simple affordable luncheon.

Authentic and homely style of cooking. I love their Lee’s signature set and their buckwheat tea. Had the sesame oil soup chicken. This is perfect for a rainy day.

Enjoy.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103278705053675847980/reviews
Kwan,3,"Location is peaceful and nice but food is nothing to rave about.
Decent fried chicken, beef noodle broth lacked depth and meesua tasted bland and the meesua-noodles was hard.

I did like that the beef noodles were had a bite and the beef meat was very tender though.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108461821292118764510/reviews
Joey Lin,4,"First timers to this place must definitely try the Lee’s Signature Rice ($11.80) which is a great sampler dish offering iconic taiwanese staples.

The Signature Rice comes with FIVE sides — braised meat, fried chicken , braised egg , braised tofu and preserved vegetables. Each side was well executed, they were all tasty but my favourite was the fried chicken. It was crispy yet still juicy and the light powder seasoning made it extra addictive.

Topped up $4.60 for a side vegetable and winter melon tea (not pictured). Was pleasantly surprised by the vegetable as it seemed like they topped it with a bit of braised meat. Not to mention, the portion is actually enough for 2 pax so you can share this with your friend.

Would be back to try their other dishes since it’s so affordable!

Tan Leng,3,"We enjoyed the signature braised pork rice, but our meal was unfortunately marred by a rude encounter with a waitress. She abruptly demanded that we move to a smaller table to accommodate a larger group. Such a lack of courtesy was disappointing.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114085823064408068732/reviews
Emma Yeo,2,"Saw some great reviews and decided to try this place out. The food was subpar, and the waitress seemed slightly impatient at our request for more vinegar in our heavily starchy mee sua. The bento set was poorly fried, with the flour coating soggy and stuck onto our rice. Only decent dish we had was the zha jiang noodles. The place was nice, but food just wasn’t it 😔",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105280780873850170518/reviews
