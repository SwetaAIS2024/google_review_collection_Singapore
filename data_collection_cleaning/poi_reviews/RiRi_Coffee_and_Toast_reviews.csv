Siah Rui Heng,4,"$4 for the toast set, $0.40 to upgrade to iced drink.

Set comes with two pieces of kaya butter/peanut butter bread, two soft boiled eggs and a drink.

Ice kopi very good, it is thick, creamy and rich.

Need to crack eggs yourself, slightly undercooked but generally still acceptable.

Kaya butter toast was decent, canâ€™t really mess it up.

The parking around this area is quite limited though, suggest to park at the hdb mscp and walk 5 minutes.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102206301013573609377/reviews
