They have a pool table and ktv to offer if you like some entertainment!\n\nA good place to chill and sing if you like, good place for gathering with friends!",

While clarifying on the bill, they went ahead and swipe the card. I’m told that they said the price wrongly and I should man up since it’s only a small amount. Ok, u earned a few bucks more, lost a few customers and earned yourself a bad review.",
