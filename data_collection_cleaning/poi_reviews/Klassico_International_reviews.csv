Eugene Tan,4,"Bought a motorised ceiling mount laundry rack from them 5 years ago at a trade show. The steel cable from the motor snapped last week. I called them up and they provided me a quote for repair. The technician came last Fri to collect the system, and its repaired and installed today. I must say the product is very good quality lasting so many years of daily use. The repair cost is reasonable, turnaround time is also not too bad.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106156158369184787225/reviews
