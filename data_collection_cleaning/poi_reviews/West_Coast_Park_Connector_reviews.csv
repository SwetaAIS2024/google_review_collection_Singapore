Forest BK,4,"This particular Park Connector rans along Sungei Pandan Kechil section of West Coast Road to West Coast Highway.
It's a short 450 metre paved path.
Despite its short length, it's heavily utilised.
Residents living around the estate would walk or jog up and down this short stretch of the Connector in the morning and, in the evening.
The path would be exposed to  full sun in the early morning hrs. And seniors just love walking or do stretching exercises in the sun.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
