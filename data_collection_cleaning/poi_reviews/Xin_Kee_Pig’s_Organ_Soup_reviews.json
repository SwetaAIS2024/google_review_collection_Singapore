I found these little attention for details really meticulous on their part.\nBraised intestines were braised really well too, flavorful, clean and chewy(but not too chewy)\nAll in all, a super 5 stars for them! Will definitely be back when craving for more or if I‚Äôm in the area!\n\nHigh recommended!!!",

Their soup packs a punch and each organ component was nice and fresh; rightfully cooked to their own al dante.(The owner might ask if you preferred the organs to be cooked longer, but let them cook their way if you want to experience the original taste)\n\nWill definitely be back for more!",
