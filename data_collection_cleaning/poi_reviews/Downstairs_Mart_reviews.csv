Kaiyi G,1,"It has always been a reliable point for parcel collection in the past, until recently. On 13 March, which was the first day of the parcel collection, I arrived at 9.45pm. Closing time is 10pm. The young guy has already locked up the place. Knocked on door and he shook his head. I tried again and asked for parcel collection and he signalled no again. It's not asking him to open the cash register, I thought it's just done on a mobile phone. Forget it, I returned on 14 March, arrived at 9.15pm, quite ahead of closing. Door was locked and this time a lady was mopping the floor. Another customer soon arrived at she continued, nonchalantly for the next 5-10min, without giving a care. Finally she opened the door and asked what I wanted, I said parcel collection, and she said ""10 minutes"" rudely. This is simply ridiculous and a total waste of my time. Sadly, I think this is the last time I'm setting this place for my parcel collection/drop off.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106008519967260785906/reviews
Im Troll,1,"The Indian lady still can secure her job there, I'm surprised.

She was rude, lazy, slow.. Talking to the phone all the while n never bother to attend to customers.

Told her I wanted to collect parcel, gave me colours to see. Repeated many times of my pin to her she couldn't catch it.. Cause she was busy talking to d guy in her loudspeaker phone. Yet she still gave me that look n tsk me. Blamed me it was my issue cause I didn't tell her what I wanted...
I had to very slowly read each number for her to capture that.

Let's see how long they can sustain. Good luck. Bye.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113177407838916803349/reviews
S L,1,"A collection point for parcels, Iâ€™ve collected my parcels from the same counter staff twice, between 615pm-645pm on 2 occasions (1 November 2022, and 9 November 2022).

The tonality and facial expressions (which the CCTV might not be able to capture) of this particular counter staff IS SO RUDE when being approached. If she cannot provide even the basic POLITENESS when strangers/customers approach her for services, please resend her for proper customer service classes instead!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102517164841514695639/reviews
Relax Ed,1,This is really a bad collection point. The Indian lady ask me to key in the code and search for my own parcel. Serve other customer who came after me. Will not choose this place as a collection point anymore,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110677495069138387969/reviews
Boon Loong,1,"The Indian lady gave me a stare when I entered the shop and ask me to come back later as she was having her dinner. When I ask second time, she raise her voice with more irritating tone. I understand but u should not give that stupid attitude to a customer. Please do something do her as it is not the first time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107967244694655681676/reviews
