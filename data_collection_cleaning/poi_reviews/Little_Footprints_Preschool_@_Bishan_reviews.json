I wish i could send my daughter there all the way but we had to transfer school as we have moved.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Tian Lao shi and Teacher Fa; no words can express how grateful I am for taking care of my girl. üíï",

      "text": "I visited the school in end Aug‚Äô23 and met principal Angeline Mah for a school visit as I had intended to enroll my child in LFP bishan. It was a very enriching experience. Angeline took me through the school and explained the different classes and the school ciriculumn.\n\nWhile the facilities are standard, I would like to applaud Angeline and her team of teachers as I could see the passion, as well as love for teaching to the children. They jump through hoops as much as they can for the child to nuture and care for them, and I was pleasantly surprised that there was such a distinction from another LFP school nearby, where the principal appeared disconnected.\n\nIt felt like a very safe space to put my child in. Thank you to your team for the hard work you do. I didn‚Äôt place my child in due to personal circumstances of my job, but If i ever  do intend to change my child‚Äôs school again- it will be wherever Angeline heads the school. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
