Nuraidah Thani,5,I usually grab my food through the drive-in service. Staff great at multi-tasking and yet remain calm and polite when taking orders and collecting payment. It's interesting how you get to peek at the kitchen to see how the staff work in harmony together ❤️.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103955612120453735291/reviews

Ken Peh,1,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. Ordered my meal at 12:24pm, according to the receipt, only receive the orders at 12:56pm.

There's an indoor and non Aircon area for this branch. There are too many customers here and the experience is sort of heavily dented due to the slow serving. Plus sitting at the non Aircon area while waiting for your meals is really not a good one, sweating profusely though due to the weather. Another reason why there are so many people here is because this branch is kid friendly with an indoor playground. Staff over the counter are not friendly as well. Tried to seek her service why it took more than 30 minutes for an order to be served, she brushed me off by saying there's a lot of staff who are not at work today.

Go to another branch to enjoy a better McDonald's experience, this branch obviously can't handle the customer load, experience sucks to the max, Fast Food becomes SLOW food.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
kennie toh,5,"One the most efficient outlet, plenty of space indoor and outdoor (shaded of course), plenty of car space. Right next to decathlon. One of the old skool Maccas that still retain the yesteryear ambient with improved efficiency.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115287252962054955508/reviews
Joanne Gilbertson,5,"Shout out to the staff here.
Super nice. Super friendly
Our server delivering our food interacted so well with our grandson it was lovely to see.
I didn’t get her name but she collects Pokémon like our grandson.
Also Stella was so nice, she acknowledged us at the table and upon leaving
A very pleasant experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113761146299509354888/reviews
