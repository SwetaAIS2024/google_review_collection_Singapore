      "text": "Capital at Clarke Quay offers an unforgettable nightclub experience with its seamless blend of lively music, premium service, and unique ambiance. From the moment you climb the stairs to enter, the floral-like fragrance and modern decor set the stage for an upscale yet fun night out.\n\nThe DJ expertly mixes pop hits and EDM tracks, keeping the energy high throughout the night. The central bar area is a visual highlight, featuring contemporary koi fish art on the ceiling, a sleek white plant centerpiece, and a chic vibe. Drinks are available à la carte, with special discounts for professionals like bankers, lawyers, real estate agents, and air stewards who show their business cards.\n\nFor larger groups, booking a table with a minimum spend unlocks the full Capital experience. Ordering champagne, vodka, or tequila bottles transforms into a mini-show, as a parade of synchronized staff delivers your drinks with props, confetti, and synchronized dancing. Watching the procession is pure entertainment! The service is impeccable—staff clear confetti instantly, mix drinks at your table, and work together seamlessly. Even the table bins are cleverly designed for quick clean-ups.\n\nThe club’s interior combines old-world charm with modern flair, showcasing glass-encased decor and lush greenery. While the toilets are limited (just four stalls each for men and women), popcorn carts near the restroom add a playful touch.\n\nPerfect for patrons in their 20s and 30s, Capital is ideal for a night of great music, drinks, and memories.",

      "text": "Pretty good experience here each time - with very decent house DJs and music. Service has definitely improved over time and the staff can handle the crowd more effectively with reduced waiting time, more professionalism. The layout is modern and segmented in very different areas for various atmosphere - either within the plush sofas in the middle of the dance floor, along the island bar, or a more “quieter”corner of the club. VIP seats also available by the DJ console. Not sure about the food though as majority of patrons, including me, visit only for the music and drinks.\n\nMin age requirement of 21 for females and 23 for men. They are now operating on Thurs, Fri, Sat and eve of Public Holidays. Do check their website and socials for special guest DJs and nights. Generally opened from 10pm-3am. Big shoutout to Cheryl and Claudia for 10/10 hospitality always!",
