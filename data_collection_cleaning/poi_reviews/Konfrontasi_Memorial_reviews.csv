Eek,3,"There's no explanation of the design and how it signifies the struggles of Konfrontasi. It kind of gave me the impression that not much thought was put into it, even if that admittedly might not have been the case.

Also, I think that the names of those who fell in the line of duty should be up on the wall. As of now they're just anonymous and largely forgotten by Singaporeans. You wouldn't even be able to find them on the internet either, as if they aren't men and women we wanted to remember and honor. I think we could do something like the wall of names at the Kranji war memorial which is important for reminding Singaporeans that real people with their own dreams and fears gave up their lives to play their part in building the country we now live in.

Nonetheless, though it's not the best memorial, it's still ours. Worth a visit and a moment of reflection.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104209424352791082534/reviews
