Stephanie Wang,5,"Been so grateful to this school for giving my 2 children a solid foundation. The academic habits and knowledge taught means that my children were very advanced when starting primary1. Whenever we meet with former classmates from Superland their parents say the same. We are all very happy with the school. The teachers were caring and nurturing, also firm when needed. Behaviour and social skills were taught well. They put on memorable special events like end of year concert.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101954993573297674312/reviews
