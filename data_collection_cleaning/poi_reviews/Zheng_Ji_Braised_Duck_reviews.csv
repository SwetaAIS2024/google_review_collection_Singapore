yuen han,5,"Here’s a great review you can use:

If you’re looking for delicious and affordable duck rice, this place is a hidden gem! The duck is tender, juicy, and well-marinated, with a rich, flavorful sauce that complements the rice perfectly. The rice itself is fragrant and not overly oily, making each bite satisfying.

Portions are generous, prices are very reasonable, and the service is quick. This was only $4!!! Whether you’re a duck rice lover or a fan of kway chap, this stall is definitely worth a visit! Highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110017624662480656044/reviews
Kwong Fei Yee,5,"Tried out the Braised Duck Noodle, Braised Duck Hor Fun and the Kway Chap. All taste good - the duck was tender and juicy. The kway chap has lots of varieties and all cooked nicely. I added the pig face and it has nice bite to it and cleaned very nicely. The price is also really good for such good dishes. Each of the noodle dish is only $3! I cannot remember how much was the kway chap. I think it was only $5 for the mixed kway chap with the additional of a generous portion of the pig face. Really worth it.

Can try!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118030178376808365901/reviews
TSY,4,Nice fresh plate of duck rice with braised pork. Rice is really fragrant and duck is fresh. The herbal soup that comes with it is nice and comforting. Must try if you’re around the area.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105925773591242471281/reviews
Manny,5,"Due to the famous Hup Seng duck rice in the next coffee shop (which i also love), this duck rice stall is often overlooked. However, this stall will really surprise you. Duck was tender and juicy, pig ear and duck gizzard tasted clean and fragrant, and their soup has a thick herbal taste which will leave you wanting more. On top of that, despite adding rice, pig ear, duck gizzard, the total only came to $4.80. The next time Hup Seng's long queue makes you feel annoyed, do give this stall a try! It's a great alternative and not inferior to Hup Seng at all.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106473660941590855809/reviews
Dawn Lim,5,"Good value duck rice that is also yummy.

Ordered a duck rice with extra duck meat and pig's ear, plus a quarter duck meat (lower quarter), a pig's ear, and two Tau Pok to take away. All for $18.

The quarter duck was $9, rare amid today's rising food prices. A plate of duck rice without additions is $3.50. Also very rare.

The good thing is the food was also tasty. And the hawkers were generous with condiments such as the sambal chilli.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113563695447323499189/reviews
