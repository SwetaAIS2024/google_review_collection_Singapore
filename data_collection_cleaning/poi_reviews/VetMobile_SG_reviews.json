      "text": "We got to know Vet Mobile while searching over the internet and engaged with them since 2019.\nOur story started from adopting Tommy from SPCA in 2019, and as Tommy is an anxious doggy whom might have been through some unfortunate journey.\nHence, we‚Äôve decided having a vet coming to our home to take care & review Tommy‚Äôs well being is crucial.\nSince we have engaged with Vet Mobile, its not returning back. Dr Angeline & Zheng Hao has known Tommy & us since the first day we called for them.\nThey have both been very great & special people. The way Dr Angeline handled Tommy, making Tommy get used to them are so nicely done.\nWe were planning to relocate to US and have also engaged Dr Angeline to help out on the pet‚Äôs health exam. Lots of paper work involved and thanks to Dr Angeline & Team professional service & their compassion, we have had managed to complete the task.\nThere are many home vets around but not many of them were known to a lot of Singaporeans.\nI would like to compliment Vet Mobile great professional services, their kindness and great attitude in handling pets with difficulties.\nThough we will no longer be able to be physically in Singapore engaging with Vet Mobile , I would say both my husband and I have the blessing & fortunate to have known Dr Angeline & Zheng Hao & the backend unsung heroes of Vet Mobile.\nWe hope there will be more people getting to know Vet Mobile, a super unique way of engaging your pets with not only medical reviews but also many special tips of how to take care of your pets by Dr Angeline & Zheng Hao.\nThank you so much for your care for Tommy all these years, Vet Mobile ÔÅä\n\nLove & Regards from Colorado,\n\nNaya & Juergen & Tommy",

      "text": "We first contacted VetMobile seeking palliative / end-of-life care for our 15-year-old senior dog, Caro. Over the past few months, they have been our unwavering support through a challenging period of illness for our beloved dog.\n\nDr. Angeline and Zheng Hao were consistently responsive and went above and beyond to assist us. Their dedication and compassion were evident as they guided us through difficult decisions and provided invaluable advice and care.\n\nDuring Caro's final days, they ensured he passed peacefully, surrounded by love and comfort. Their presence and support were incredibly reassuring to our family during this emotional time. We are deeply grateful to them for their empathy and professionalism.\n\nMy family wholeheartedly recommends VetMobile's services to anyone needing palliative / hospice care for their pets. Dr. Angeline and Zheng Hao truly understand that this is a journey they walk with you, offering compassionate care every step of the way. Thank you for all that you do ‚ù§Ô∏è",

It is an understatement to say that they are compassionate and effective.\n\nThank you so much for caring for my cat, Tobi, being reassuring, and doing your best for every sentient-being that crosses paths with you. You guys are truly the most amazing humans and vet team. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèª‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nPS:\nDespite being a lean team, VetMobile often goes out of their way to support their clients. However, they are only human, and can only fit in X-number of clients per day. Therefore, if your animal companion needs urgent support and you‚Äôre a new client enquiring, it is important to know that it is not their fault if they are unable to provide an appointment slot (of ur preference), and that it is OUR responsibility to make alternative plans. üôèüèª",

They are professional, knowledgeable, gentle, kind, empathetic, sweet, friendly & helpful in so many aspects. Zheng Hao is strong too: the equipment he manages are rather heavy! All my cats & I thank you both so very much!\n\nNot forgetting the backend support team who are friendly, prompt in their replies, and sweet too.\n\nThank you again Dr Angeline Yang, for the kindness (Cupcake & Chocolat who have crossed the rainbow bridge), and the ongoing treatment for Babie, Munchkin & Pumpkin.",
