MH Tham,4,"Curious about the overwhelming negative reviews across multiple platforms, including multiple delivery apps, I decided to give this place a try.

Pricing was average, which was a promising start. I ordered small portions of Hokkien prawn mee, black carrot cake, and white carrot cake for two pax, mindful of complaints about serving sizes.

The food arrived promptly for breakfast, and to my surprise, it wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as expected. The white carrot cake was eggy with a mild crisp, while the black version was dark but not overly salty or charred. The best of the lot was the Hokkien prawn mee, which was moist, mildly flavorful with wok hei, and topped with a rather meh chilli and a generous portion of lard. Just two prawns though, so manage your expectations accordingly.

While slightly above average, it certainly doesn‚Äôt deserve its bad reputation, as it is better than many delivery options out there.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112376174358198242550/reviews

Siying Goh,5,"Ordered seafood pao fan and it was savoury and delicious! Good amount of fried egg given, 2 prawns, 4-5 slices of fish and maybe 10+ lala. Can be a little less salty (personal preference) - my husband didn‚Äôt find it salty.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109371438224807094304/reviews
Jechtto,2,"Personally, hokkien mee available at ungodly hours, this is still edible, very mild wok hey, almost zero prawn broth taste. For $6 there's only 2 prawns though at least the prawns were fresh. There were a few pieces of squid and pork belly and that's about it. The chilli was fine too nothing to rave about but at least it had some heat.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106407471320614893952/reviews
Lee Sean,1,"Not worth your money!
Tasteless, no wok hei, chilli taste is weird.
One of the worst I‚Äôve tried in the area",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117898934997653842910/reviews
