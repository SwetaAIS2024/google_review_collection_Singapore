Jean Lau,2,"Easy to purchase but pick up is a separate matter. Made a special trip down 3 days after receiving the collection email. Spent 15 minutes walking in circles unable to find the unit, called them then was informed the vet is not in. There is no one else around for collection and the vet will not be back for 3 hours. Wasted time, effort and parking. Was told to call beforehand in the future.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118188603569939067350/reviews
