Rex Tan,4,"They updated the restaurant recently. The food was still nice, and the prices for the set meals were rather reasonable. Portions were sizeable, too. Service was ok too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106061387136457950815/reviews
Jamie Tan,5,"The food at this restaurant is generally good, with the weekday menu being a standout feature. The sashimi is exceptionally fresh, and the ambiance is authentically Japanese, which enhances the dining experience. However, there was a disappointing moment during our visit when some of our meals took 45 minutes to be served due to a kitchen oversight. While the quality of the food is commendable, the service could use some improvement to ensure a smoother experience for diners.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103567188767254938169/reviews
"Chan Wai, 陈柃汐",5,"Very authentic Japanese restaurant, they have a few rooms with tatami type of seats. Staffs are very friendly and helpful. They forgot about the dipping sauce for my tempura but quickly serve me one when I asked for it.
The set lunch is value for money, while the ala carte is a little pricy given the location and the restaurant is in needs of renovation.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100289457793824033886/reviews
Jerry Ong,4,"We had a large group gathering here. The atmosphere was great, and they have private rooms available for more than 10 people. Overall, the food was average, not superb, The rice is not Japanese rice.

The service was good, except for the fact that the online ordering system wasn't working. We waited for quite a while for our order, only to find out when we checked with the waitress. It would be better to remove the QR code for online ordering.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110336654627948992336/reviews
Nelson Lee,5,"Despite its somewhat older appearance, this restaurant offers excellent quality food at great value. The menu is impressive, providing private dining spaces perfect for large groups, which adds a special touch to the dining experience. While the air conditioning may struggle on particularly hot days, this does not detract from the overall quality of the food and service. I'm giving it five stars because I believe the current Google rating of 3.9 undervalues what this place has to offer. Highly recommended for those who appreciate good food in a comfortable setting.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116643805849749447490/reviews
