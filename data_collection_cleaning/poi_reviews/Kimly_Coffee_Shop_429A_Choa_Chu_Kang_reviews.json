      "text": "Typical coffeeshop offer the dimsum.  Usually I only eat from restaurants.\nOrdered 3 pcs of items, fried prawn dumpling, fried Carrot cake and red bean paste sesame.\nFirstly, all item are just lightly warm and not serving hot.\nPrawn dumpling giving a small shrimp and a bit of \"fish\" paste. Carrot cake doesn't find any ingredient and red bean sesame is total a failure, the skin is thick and hard, the red bean paste is very dry.\nIf just to fill up the stomach I think it just OK. As they charge $3.00 for 3 pcs.\nThis morning, I spent total $4.50 include with one coffee. It is expensive.",

Went on a weekend afternoon, the coffeeshop is not crowded and I ordered a plate of beehoon, pork liver mee pork , laksa , chicken rice and wanton mee.\nStrongly recommend to order the pork liver mee pok. The liver is soft and tender. It’s cooked nicely. Chicken rice owner is very friendly. He gave a big bowl of soup for my kids and generous in the servings. Too bad I didn’t take pictures of it as they are too hungry.",
