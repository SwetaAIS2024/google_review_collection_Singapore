Bernard Ong,4,"Wife say give it a try. I do like the place. Spacious and the air smell alright  not dark environment.

Food is nice.the kuah is fantastic! But the drink... the teh not to my liking sadly. Tried my wife's kopi same thing not to my liking.
But will come again to try others on the menu.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115391634503009241978/reviews
Collin Ng,4,"The keuh is indeed quite good.
I especially like the golden bun oh ni, tasty but not too sweet and has the oh ni fragrance.
The curry prawn nasi lemak is good too.
But my favourite is the signature milk tea, nice!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100358502333657729087/reviews
K Woo,5,"My family has been patronising Ah Ma since 4 years ago. The Char Kway tiao is excellent. I enjoy the teochew porridge with the side dishes -my comfort food. Service is fantastic too.

I like to commend your staff at the pop-up stall in Aeon Bukit Indah. I bought 8 dumplings on 20 Mar Thu at around 2.30pm but had forgotten to take it. Your staff (looks like a teenage/young adult with long hair) searched for us at the mall and she found us when we were leaving the mall. She was panting when she caught up with us so she must have searched high and low for us. We are very thankful to her for going the extra mile. Pls convey our heartfelt thanks to her!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112768546494113098819/reviews
Bugwagen,4,"Walked in for lunch on a weekday.  It was not crowded.  The Char Kway Teow was the best, followed by the Kway Teow soup.  The kuehs were average.  Fried Yam bun was good.  The rojak wasnâ€™t great.  Nice place to chill.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109071563364310385081/reviews
