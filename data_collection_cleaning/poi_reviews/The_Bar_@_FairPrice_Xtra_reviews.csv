Victor Lim,5,"We had a wine and cheese tasting/pairing here. $55/pax. It was a good experience. Not stuffy and really relax. The bar - Sam was interesting, friendly, funny and customer centric. Ching - The Cheese Shop was enthusiastic and lots of great information. Wonderful variety of cheeses. We enjoyed ourselves. Good work and keep it up!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117379436907577710029/reviews
Yve,5,"Awesome find while waiting for my friend at Parkway Parade. This is an area on one end of Fairprice Xtra, and there are some food counters and a bar. Sat down at the bar which serves up a few craft beers, wine and simple cocktails. Prices are very reasonable. You can order food from other counters to eat at the bar counter too. Great way to spend a couple of hours if you're looking for a drink and not wanting the fuss and expense of going to a proper bar. Just don't expect ambience - you're in a supermarket afterall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107836813499490409536/reviews
Alex lee Lee,2,"""I really enjoyed the craft beer and the overall cleanliness of the establishment. Unfortunately, the manager (balding male) significantly impacted my experience. His attitude was poor, characterized by uncalled-for remarks and a lack of engagement with customers. While other aspects were positive, his behavior detracted from the overall atmosphere. I hope management addresses this.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110011371903182642284/reviews
