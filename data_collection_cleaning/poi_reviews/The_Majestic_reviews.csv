CK C,3,"A very beautiful heritage building that, unfortunately, has been mismanaged and underutilised.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
liliankuan 1 Kuan,4,"Beautiful historical structure building although being refurbished into new mall, it's still reminds me in 50's era. Heard it was an opera theater before turned into movie theater and now, a mall.

Won't it be nice, to turn it into a heritage museum to in-store all the Chinese rich cultures here. The location is really tragic, symbolic you're in the central of Chinatown.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109565599348964696616/reviews
Mr. Li (李中平),3,"The Majestic was built in 1927 by Eu Tong Sen, a tin mining and rubber magnate, built a Cantonese opera house for his wife who was a Cantonese opera fan (echoes of Mumtaz Mahal). Which was turned into a movie theater in the age of celluloid, then as a mall where people can still enjoy the art deco structure while they eat at restaurants or shop within the mall.

Came here too early while raining sadly just caught the exterior of the building across the street and before ducking inside the MRT station beside it. #RP",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109712642686684269540/reviews
Donna Cashore,3,"This Art deco building, built in 1927 by Eu Tong Sen is gorgeous with hand-painted tiles depicting Cantonese Opera and flying dragons on the facade.  But looking at the building is all there is to do at this location. Best viewed from opposite side of street.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115345192795203735565/reviews
