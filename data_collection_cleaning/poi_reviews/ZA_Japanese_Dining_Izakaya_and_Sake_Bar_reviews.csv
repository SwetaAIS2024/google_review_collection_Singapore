Terry Chua,4,"Ordered udon, Tori karaage, California maki for dinner. To me, was quite average tasting. The California maki tasted a bit odd and had a fishy taste. Could be due to the sauce or they added unagi.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114779419389907602398/reviews
Issac Chen,5,"Had a family celebration over here. Quite a nice surprise find to be honest. It was pouring heavily and the was not crowded. The owner and the staff were amazingly kind to us despite the noise level.

Food was really fresh and great to be honest for such one located in a hidden corner. Food were lighter on the palate and not heavily doused in sauces. Place is relatively small but cosy.

Overall, had a wonderful meal here. Price is decent looking at the amount of food we got, with 2 kids around. The ice cream is superb ! Definitely recommended for those around the area to give it a try. Manpower is low so manage your expectations if it's crowded !",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102460707264192871696/reviews
