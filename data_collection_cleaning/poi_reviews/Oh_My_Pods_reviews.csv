Laily Adelia,4,"Great and affordable place to stay, but only for backpackers or group of friends. I stayed there and rent >15 pods, turns out the owner gave us the whole room so we didn't share room with other guests. Has 3 bathrooms, laundry area, living room, kitchen, and praying spot. The minus is, it didnt have elevator. Stairs only. Kinda struggling for guests with lots of lugages ðŸ¥´",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117308009431587442492/reviews
