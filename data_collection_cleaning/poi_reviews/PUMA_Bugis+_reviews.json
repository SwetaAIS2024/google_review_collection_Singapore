As we went in, we were greeted with a friendly staff Lionel and he proceeded to having a chit chat with us which made us feel comfortable! He also told us about the available promotion and was efficient in serving us and looking for the sizes of our shoes! His service made me want to purchase more shoes and helped me affirm my decision!",

And we were attended by this cute girl named Jodie, even she's just 16yrs old but her way of attending to customers needs and how polite she responded is all sincerity I can feel,  no matter how busy the outlet earlier as it was Sunday and of course families with kids you know like how chaotic... but still staffs are not rude good team work as there's only 3 staffs. All of them handle professionally.",

Tried on one model, and was having a serious convo with my spouse on whether to purchase, with the shoe in my hand. One female staff with spectacles suddenly asked \"is this your size?\" and before I could even answer rudely snatched the shoe out of my hand to place it back on the shelf. Is this how you guys actually want to treat prospective customers? No wonder your store is empty on 11.11 sales on a Sat evening.\ncontact:",
