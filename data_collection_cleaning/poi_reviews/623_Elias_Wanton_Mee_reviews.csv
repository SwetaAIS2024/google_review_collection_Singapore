阿宝,3,"This stall was running a promo when I walked pass last week so decided to give it a try.

The noodle is nothing special, just like an ordinary bowl of wanton noodle.

The owner or staff definitely needs to put in more effort in order to make it.

Benjamin Tan,1,"Ordered wanton noodle. Never have I thought that anything could go wrong with wanton noodle.

The noodle is not cooked properly, partially raw. The fried wanton taste super strong of alkaline taste. The char siew is hard and rubbery.

I hardly give any stall bad review but this is one of those that need to review their cooking process.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112451030407906375249/reviews
G T,1,The worse wanton noddle I ever tasted in my whole life. Believe it or not. I don’t know how to explain. It is very very bad. I think it is not cooked by a cook.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112938235207323580002/reviews
