      "text": "Ordered so many times and this time is horribly disappointed. Ordered 300 sticks for 3 families because we love the satay and just a simple request to split the gravy to 3 pack but was rejected reason being saving the environment for reduce plastic bag. However, asked me to cancel order and split the order to 3 different orders so each order have their own gravy, make no sense to waste paper to print additional invoice and make additional orders. They rather want me to cancel order and reorder again and not wanting the split the gravy for my current order. Seriously disappointed by the operator, hope that they can be more flexible else when people want to make group purchases have to order one by one which is not an ideal way of doing business.",

      "text": "The building did a groupbuy and we ordered chicken and pork satay, which came frozen.  Once grilled in the oven, the meats were pretty tasty, especially with cucumbers, onions and ketupat.  They even provided a small pack of pineapple sauce.  The satay sauce, which nice, was not in sealed packets but were rather kept in plastic bags.",

      "text": "Good price point and delicious satay especially the mutton and pork. Our choice of satay provider whenever we have BBQ at home. Their ketupat is good too, goes very well with the satay and sauce. The highlight is that they provide pineapple sauce with the satay sauce, this helps to cleanse the oil associated with BBQ.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone looking for nice and affordable satay. The portal to order is easy to use and staff are prompt to response to your order.",
