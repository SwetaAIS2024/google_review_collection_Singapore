Ben L,4,"The braised pork ribs is pretty good, braised to tender and the flavour is good. Not salty which is always a good thing. Price is affordable and portion is good for a meal. Recommended to try if you are in the area for nice braised pork. Looking forward to trying the pork cheek next time. And the kampung curry chicken too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105615998986963836277/reviews
Katherine Happiest,4,"I enjoyed the braised pork bowl very much
It’s flavourful and tasty
It’s interesting combination is worth highlighting
There’s onsen egg, black fungus, tofu, vegetable etc

I agree that $5.50 is very good value for this tasty bowl

Chef shared that he didn’t add any MSG in his food",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103056298337699105255/reviews
Bryan H,5,Tried the pork leg bowl recently and it's really good. Very value for money at only $5.50. Their chilli and curry chicken is pretty nice too. Not to mention the owner is a nice man.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957117590225038087/reviews

Nancy Lim,5,This is a new store and and decided to try it. The boss was a very nice and humble person and explained that his meats are specially chosen to ensure good quality. The meat is sooooo flavourful!!! The pork rib meat is so soft and it just melt in mouth!! Same goes for the pork leg rice!! Price is reasonable too!!! Definitely worth buying it!!!!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102123882364090075566/reviews
