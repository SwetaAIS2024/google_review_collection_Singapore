Tried their Osmanthus Oolong Cake, Tiramisu Cream Latte and Hot Cappuccino.\nOsmanthus Oolong cake was quite nice and fluffy, the sponge cake inside was light, moist and soft, but the cream was a bit too sweet for my liking. Coffee was good and smooth, balanced well with the milk. Tiramisu Cream Latte was creamy and good too.\nTried also their Roasted Genmaicha Gelato. The tea taste was strong and bittersweet. It‚Äôs sweet at first then got a bitter tea aftertaste.\nOverall was good experience. Service was quite slow though, but staff were helpful.\nNext visit: Tried their Dirty Matcha and Matcha Strawberry Teacake for our tea time. Dirty Matcha was good, creamy and strong matcha flavour, balanced with the coffee taste. The teacake was nice, moist and wonderful, not too sweet. Both drink and teacake was enjoyable.', 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': 'Quite long queue as cafe was busy, we waited for about 20 mins. Nice atmosphere with nice music.
