Staff refused to register my son, saying too many patients to clear. See photo for how many patients were waiting to see the doctor. Very unprofessional to not follow the instructions that it states its customers and for a doctor to turn away sick individuals.",

      "text": "OneCare Medical Clinic is incredibly convenient for me, located just five minutes from my house. It’s my go-to place for medical advice whenever I’m unwell.\n\nThe staff are always friendly and helpful. Since I prefer to avoid long waits during peak hours, I often call ahead to check the crowd. There’s a particularly kind Malay staff member who advises me on the best times to visit, helping me avoid peak hours, especially on Mondays. Thanks to her helpful tips, I can usually schedule my visits for quieter times.\n\nThe doctors at the clinic are friendly, professional, and thorough. While there isn’t a permanent resident doctor, each doctor I’ve seen has taken time to examine my concerns with care and detail. This level of attention has made my visits reassuring and pleasant.\n\nOverall, the convenience, friendly staff, and professional care make this clinic an excellent choice for my healthcare needs.",

We’ve had ok experiences until today when I brought my daughter for an evening consult for cold symptoms. Won’t name names but if the management is willing to contact me for feedback, I will provide the name privately. The doctor was dismissive when my daughter tried to explain how she felt. Hardly examined her as well.",

      "text": "I had a terrible experience at OneCare Clinic Fernvale. The doctor was unprofessional and dismissive, assuming I was faking my condition just because I was using my company medical card. I requested a referral to a specialist due to my severe pain, but he refused and told me to go to A&E if it was really that bad.\n\nThis was a huge problem because, without a referral from a company GP, my insurance claim would be complicated. The next day, I visited another clinic, and the doctor there immediately issued a referral letter, even mentioning that my condition could be dangerous if left untreated.\n\nIt’s unacceptable for a doctor to ignore a patient's concerns like this. Avoid this clinic if you want proper medical attention!",
