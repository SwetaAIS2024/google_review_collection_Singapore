      "text": "Food is below average. Service is question mark.\n\nCame here for the first time. Booked table for 10 people, didn't specify outdoor or indoor. The Indian manager told us to sit outdoors. After awhile it started pouring heavily. We had to shift the table inwards as our friends legs were getting drenched by the water at the back.\n\nEverything is self-service and they still dare to charge service charge. When asked for water, the waiter told us to go to counter and walked off. When we went to the counter, was told that water is chargeable. We ordered 3 bottles of water but they only served the water after 10 minutes.\n\nF&B is an expensive industry but this wouldn't be the way you treat your guests if you were the owner of this restaurant and invited your own family.\n\nThe whole experience felt bad, cold and unwelcoming and I will not come back again even if the food is good. I would not recommend coming here unless you are looking for a kid-friendly place (sometimes they set up bouncy castle, soccer etc) and don't mind bad/non-existent service.",

Outdoor area is dog friendly here at Cafe Melba. Very ideal for family with kids or fur kids :)\n\nOverall the food is not bad and thumbs up on the chicken Pamigiana! Really tasty. Their fries are not bad too. We will surely return again for our friends gathering.\n\nService is acceptable and the food was served pretty fast during a busy Sunday lunch.",
