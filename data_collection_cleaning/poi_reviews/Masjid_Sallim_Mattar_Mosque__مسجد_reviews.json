Prayer hall can accommodate 50 congregants per level in accordance to SafeEntry regulations. Parking is a little difficult so for drivers, please search for parking at ‚Äú8 Tanner Road, HYFA‚Äù and it is a 4-minute walk from there.",

Ventilation needs to be improved as it was quite hot and stuffy despite the fans (the max speed was quite slow). I strongly suggest switching on the air-conditioning during Friday prayers to enhance the comfort level.",
