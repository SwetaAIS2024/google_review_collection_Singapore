      "text": "My daughter went to rainbow cove sennett right from PG till K1. She received good care and attention while she was there. Her eating habits improved and she started loving food! They have various activities throughout the week like gardening, sports ball, reader programs, art etc. Although there’s a school uniform, the children were free to wear anything they love and express themselves, which I thought was cool. My daughter was very fond of her nursery teacher Ms.Hannah. And as parents we valued the warmth and care shown by the principal Shelyn who made us feel confident about our choice of preschool.",

      "text": "My daughter has been in Rainbow Cove Sennett since she was 18 months and it has been without doubt the best decision I have ever made for her. Rainbow Cove Sennett gives parents and children the assurance of a home away from home. The relationship that the school has with the children and parents is very home-like. My daughter is always happy when I fetch her, the school activities are always full of so much fun for the children. The teachers are loving and respectful towards the children and professionally carries themselves in their work. The recent September Holiday Programme activities are nothing short of joy and childhood memories for my daughter! If you are looking for a place where your child would be safe and well-being taken care of, Rainbow Cove @ Sennett is the place!",

      "text": "I sent both my daughters to Rainbow Cove @ Sennett based on good reviews from a family friend. The teachers are very warm, caring and take good care of the children. The school curriculum is also very holistic, with strong focus on both languages and the arts. My girls especially enjoy the Artelier program. I’m very happy to note that my girls have grown to be well rounded girls and the elder one who has since graduated to Primary school had no problems adapting to Primary school education. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "My son studied here for 3 years and I have been recommending this school to many of my neighbours. Before enrolling, we went on a school hunt and met up with many principles/teachers. We chose Rainbow Cove @ Sennett as Ms Shelyn - the principle shared her teaching technique and principles that just aligned with ours and is respecting each child's development and characters. Moreover, she always ensures smooth line of communications with parents, either via a quick update during drop off/pick up time, or via Whatsapp.\nAnother plus point is the curriculum of the school is very exciting, even for the parents when hearing about it. They have Fun Friday and School Holiday with activities like making sushi, smoothie, Christmas wreath, Sport days, making moon cakes, chicken noodle soup, etc... all the foods can be brought back home to share with parents. I have to say the teachers are very creative and bring alot of fun time for the children.\nI have seen my son grown up so much in this school and I would like to take this chance to thank all the teachers for being part of his development journey.",

      "text": "My son has been in Rainbow Cove, Sennett for well over 2 years now. And he loves his school. The staff are well trained and treat the children with warmth, care, and respect. As a parent, I've felt comfortable going to the teachers with my questions, and I feel safe leaving my child in their care. The school provides periodic feedback on my son's academic progress, social interaction skills and emotional development. They have also helped us with some of his milestones like potty training. In particular, I find the curricula engaging, pertinent and adequately challenging based on my son's age at different stages of his growth. I especially like the hands-on activities like cookery and craft as it exposes the children to a holistic set of learning outcomes. Importantly, the school has a dedicated Chinese language focus, which is particularly helpful for my son as I'm eager for him to learn Chinese. On the nutrition front, there is a lot of care taken in curating the weekly menu - the food is wholesome, tasty and variegated. Moreover, the school is always kept clean and tidy. Lastly, the principal of the school is excellent and does a fantastic job in overseeing all aspects from running the school to interaction with parents.",
