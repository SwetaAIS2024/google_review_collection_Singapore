Bernard,5,"Since young, I have seen Dr Loh and it be maybe 25 years. I really appreciated his honesty and his professionalism in his treatment. He always makes a point to be as clear as possible during consultation while at the same time, being mindful of his patientsâ€™ anxiety of their conditions. Thank you very much!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102410402389941091293/reviews
Rachel Yeo,1,Do not visit if it's ENT case for toddler. Regretted engaging this doctor for tonsilectomy op. My 3 year old and myself were traumatized from the experience. Better to spend the $12K one day op and hospital stay somewhere else. Didnt need to take parental advice from you just because your children are doctors and to be told that my son is being manipulative.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107143932267873383941/reviews
