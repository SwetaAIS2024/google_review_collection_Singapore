suzen,1,"Went back to this China supermart with its eatery, after reading the online community to review for this stall's noodles. Apparently, the noodles with chickpeas cannot make it. Did feedback to the community, no response at all. Can forget about it. Somemore this noodles stall's staff was totally unfriendly. Due to the dine-in space is so squeeze & hard to find table. Was so happened to manage to get a table next to this noodles stall. Yet the staff still wanted me to come out if the dine-in area to go to their front stall to collect the chopstick & spoon. Zero customer service level. No sympathy towards customer, who was me got stuck between the dine-in crowds.

However, the xiao long bao was very nice. Too bad, cannot eat much. Otherwise would like to order the dim sum & duck meat. With its stall as Chengdu braised, will go back again & try it.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110813622133166743966/reviews
Dorae mon,1,"I had an extremely frustrating experience at the food court in [SCARLET SUPERMARKET. Despite many empty seats, most of them were being hogged by people who weren’t even eating. Some were using the tables to sleep, others were playing games, and one person even brought a portable fan while reserving multiple seats for family members who were off shopping.

When I tried to ask for a seat to quickly eat my meal, no one was willing to give up their table—even when they weren’t eating or were gone for long periods. One table had just two bags left on it for at least 35 minutes while the owner went shopping!

When I approached the staff for help, they told me it was beyond their control and under management's responsibility. This lack of enforcement leaves paying customers, like myself, without a place to eat while non-eaters occupy the space.

This mismanagement ruined my dining experience, and I won’t be returning anytime soon. Management needs to take action to ensure that food court seating is available for diners, not for those treating it as a lounge or personal space.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117761147849497320254/reviews
