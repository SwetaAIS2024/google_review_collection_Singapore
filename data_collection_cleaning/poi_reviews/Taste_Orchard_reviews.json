      "text": "Recently heard about this new mall and decided to visit. Very interesting concept as the mall has a supermarket from B1 to level 2.\n\nCurrently they have a wide selection of trendy eateries ranging from Korean, Japanese, local and western food.\n\nNoticed an optician shop and a tuition center upstairs, but most parts of the upper level are not ready yet. But so far it has a very homely and calm atmosphere. Can’t wait to see what it will be like when it’s all done!",

Had to get information from cashier from another store to know that the staff is on leave today and tomorrow 30th and 31st August. No information was displayed at the counter pertaining to this unavailability. Still has big big banner all over the mall showing and promoting this buffet.",

      "text": "2nd visit\nHappy to get Tokyo’s beloved chocolate boutique, Magie du Chocolat, here in Singapore! Known for its artisanal creations and luxurious presentation, this Japanese brand has taken chocolate-making to the next level!! Trust me, this is not your average chocolate box.  One bite, and you’ll understand why it’s called \"Magie.\"\n\nEach piece is handcrafted with care, making the experience feel just as premium as the taste. It’s a flavour journey across textures, from creamy and smooth to crunchy and chewy — a true treat for the senses.\n\nFeaturing\nMilk Pistachio – Creamy, nutty, and irresistibly smooth\n\nAlmond Crunch – A satisfying snap with every bite\n\nCoffee Blend – Bold, aromatic, and perfect for caffeine lovers\n\nMilk Caramel – Rich, buttery caramel wrapped in silky chocolate\n\n1st visit\nHappy to get Canelé de CHIANT, a canelé specialty store hailing from Niigata, Japan here. Crafted by a modern Italian chef with a patisserie background, these canelés are meticulously made, with each flavour created from scratch.\n\nYou can’t go wrong with a traditional canele, but de Chianti has more flavours including matcha, honey lemon cheese, coconut, salted caramel, black sesame, early grey and even saikyo miso!!!",

It has now been converted into Hao Mart Excellente Orchard and has many food outlets on the ground floor.\n\nThere is also a wine cellar cum bar where u can purchase alcohol by the bottle or by glass and enjoy it there. Like normal supermarkets, there is a fresh seafood and meat section. However, they also provide cooking service at $12 per portion if you wish to consume it there.\n\nEntrance to the carpark is via Koek Road (behind the building)",
