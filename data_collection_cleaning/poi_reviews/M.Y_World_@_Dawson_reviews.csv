Joey Wong,5,"I would like to commend and highly recommend M.Y World at Dawson. Their teachers, vice principals, and principals are friendly and approachable. As a first time parent, i truly appreciate the updates through their App and feedback during pick ups. Hence, I am able to trust my child fully during school days and head to work daily. You know your kid is in safe hands when she speaks highly of her teachers. Also, I received many praises that my child is able to speak and articulate her thoughts well at such a young age. Even I am amazed by the words she used at home. Thank you Ms Michelle, Ms Zhang, Xu Lao Shi, Ms Annabelle and Ms Mei Yee for all you have done for my child(:",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103329889384599245424/reviews
