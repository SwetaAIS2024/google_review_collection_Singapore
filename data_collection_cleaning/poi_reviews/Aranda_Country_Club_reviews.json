The living room is too big, we are able to put the backdrop to do the party in first unit and catering in second unit. Each unit has 2 bedrooms, 2 toilets, kitchen and balcony.\nFor weekend they required 2 consecutive nights. We stayed there for 2 nights last weekend. Cooking is not allowed but can use the bbq pit. And there’s a nearby mall in the area. Can use the swimming pool as well.\nI think it’s very affordable and big place to rent for all occasions. And for all ntuc members, they got a discount as well.\nAnd to get side by side unit need to book 4 months earlier.\nOverall, our stay and birthday celebration is really awesome.",

Minus 1 star because of the lack in amenities (eg. no dishwashing soap, hair dryer or plates/bowls) so you have to come prepared. Can also be noisy in the day if your room is right next to wild wild wet.  Also didn’t use the bbq pits cause was raining non-stop, but it doesn’t look very well maintained. Nevertheless, would be back next time!",
