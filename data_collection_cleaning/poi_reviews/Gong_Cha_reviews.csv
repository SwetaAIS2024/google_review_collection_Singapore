James L,2,"When they actually have the ingredients, it's good. However, the number of times that I have turned up there at around 11:30am and they are 'sold out' of pearl milk tea (i.e. they don't have any tapioca pearls) is ridiculous for a bubble tea shop.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109089289161489750200/reviews
Vicq,4,Only 2 touchscreen ordering available and it can get quite busy and crowded during lunch peak hour period. Waiting time for drinks to be prepared is about 10mins or so during lunch peak period.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106473378023729080154/reviews
Justin C,1,"Experience was during lunch hours on Thursday 10th November 2022. Terrible customer service. No ezlink payment available even though the machine said ezlink payment is available. No cash accepted. No other customer support nor help and the lady on duty that day just rudely mentioned ""we could not help"" and I left angrily. Honestly, please train your staff to have better customer service, or you would only expect bad customer reviews coming.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110458351189925251356/reviews

I tried from the Brewed Tea series. The tea is freshly brewed from a tea bag, and depending on your order, milk will be added to it.

I have tried both the Osmanthus Honey Oolong Milk Tea and the Buckwheat Green Milk Tea, both with no sugar. The tea flavor itself is quite strong and is quite fragrant.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113192406653516830642/reviews
