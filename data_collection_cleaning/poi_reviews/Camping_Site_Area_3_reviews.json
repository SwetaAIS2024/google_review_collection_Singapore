It‚Äôs hard to access here by public transport with carrying all the gear.",

Just wondering what time it will reach our campsite üòÖ",

Families could be there to camp and that's when you hope they're the courteous type who know when to pipe down.\n\nLots of joggers and fast e-scooters (not sure if it's legal) around so cross the jogging/bicycle tracks with caution.\n\nHas public washroom nearby and a pub, food & drinks are not far away. The beach is... not really clean. hardly see anybody swim there.",
