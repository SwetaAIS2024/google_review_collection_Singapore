Taste wise cant really go wrong right mookata is just mookata. Shocked at the vermicelli because for so little its a dollar. Literally suck 1 time all gone. Dont think i will go back again",

      "text": "A hidden gem in Punggol. The staff are nice and friendly. Once you've arrived, they will immediately assist you and give the things you'll need for your mookata experience.\n\nThe prices of their food are very affordable. We ordered 6 kinds of meat (pork and chicken), vegetables, tofu and noodles that were good for 3 persons and we only paid $34. ðŸ™ˆ\n\nIf you want to try this, I would highly recommend to visit before 6pm as there will be a long queue from 6pm onwards even on weekdays.",

      "text": "This place is walking distance from the Nibong LRT station and on weekends, it gets really crowded.\nFood wise - value for money. I paid $45 for a 4 pax set which comes with chicken, pork sausages, 4 prawns, squids and assorted mushrooms and vegetables. I added on some beef short plates for 3.40 each and smoked duck for another 3.60 each.\nThe meats are not the best cut, just like what you expect from other mookata.\nThe soup is not very tasty, actually after youâ€™ve put in the corn, everything tastes corn-yish.\nService is friendly and fast.\nDrinks are expensive here. Go buy from Sheng Shiong next door (joking joking)",
