Marcus Chan,5,"I think this is the best fish ball noodles in the East in my opinion. The ingredients are fresh and generous portion.
The lady boss is very friendly and smiley.

SK Ho,5,"Situated at marine terrace food centre. It is one of the best bcm around to me. Usually crowded on saturday morning, but they are very systematic and organised and fast to serve your order. The portion is quite huge for one person. I normally cannot finish all the noodles. Noodles are tasty, but don't leave a thirsty feeling after the meal.  Highly recommend.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106052152130933399046/reviews
