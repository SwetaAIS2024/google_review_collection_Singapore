The environment is clean, well-maintained, and gives the penguins plenty of space to swim and play. The up-close views make it a perfect spot for families, especially with kids who were absolutely fascinated. Highly recommended for anyone looking for an engaging and educational experience!",

The space is interactive and educational, with plenty of information about the penguins' habitats and behaviors. My kids were thrilled to watch the penguins swim and waddle around, and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable, answering all of our questions with enthusiasm. It's a great spot for families, and we left with smiles all around. Highly recommend for anyone visiting with children!",

But as you make your way up, you will come across a video screening about the King Penguin - a must watch for kids and adults! As you ascend to the top level, you get to see the penguins. We recommend you come many times during your visit to Bird Paradise to catch them during their feeding times. They will be more active and you see them jumping, swimming around the area!",
