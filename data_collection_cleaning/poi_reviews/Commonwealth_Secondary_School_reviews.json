      "text": "Commonwealth Secondary School stands out as an exemplary institution that blends academic excellence with cultural vibrancy and holistic development. The school's dedication to nurturing talents across diverse domains is truly commendable.\n\nOne of the highlights is the inclusion of Tamil literature in the curriculum, which ensures students stay connected to their cultural roots. The school also celebrates diversity through its vibrant Indian Dance (Tamil dance) program, which allows students to explore their heritage while showcasing their talent and creativity. These performances are both graceful and a true testament to the school's commitment to cultural appreciation.\n\nThe wide range of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) at Commonwealth Secondary is another remarkable feature. From performing arts to sports, thereâ€™s something for every student to pursue their passion and develop essential life skills. The schoolâ€™s nurturing environment and dedicated teachers provide the perfect support system for students to excel.\n\nFurthermore, the schoolâ€™s focus on fostering a well-rounded education ensures students are prepared for challenges beyond academics.

      "text": "I got picked on within the first week, very unpleasant. The students from my class are all quite toxic, lots of dramas going on every week. Other classes seem very chill and it looks like it's only my class that has so much things going on. Would love to be in another class, almost all the nice people I know are from other classes. Wonder why they don't split the G3 and G1/2 students, it's easy to be influenced by the people around you. The teachers teach quite well, I learnt a lot. Generally nothing to complain about except for the students there.",

Really impressed that they have a holistic mindset to education and have incorporated design thinking and eco stewardship lessons in addition to their regular curriculum.
