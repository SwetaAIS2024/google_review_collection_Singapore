Alvin Trailor,1,"Don't come here!!
The school equipment sucks. And complain for so long never buy equipment.. the whole school only has 3 amplifiers ... 3!!  And all the drums set are old and broken.
Every time when practice or rehearsal there are not enough amps and mics.  Gave feedback for so long the school never bothered us...

And note that all the five stars comments before this is written by the employees in the school so don't trust those",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100627281731100874182/reviews
