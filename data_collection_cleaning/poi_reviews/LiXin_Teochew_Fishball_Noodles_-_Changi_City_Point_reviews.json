The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the fishballs had a great texture and flavor. It was exactly what I needed to feel at home again. Definitely a must-try if you‚Äôre looking for something tasty and satisfying. Highly recommend!",

I just want to ask who in the right mind put tomato sauce in dry noodles. It was bad. My wife‚Äôs mee tai mak was super oily, call it oil noodles if you want.\n\nService just pure bad, they just serve you super slowly, make you queue, just hope you that you don‚Äôt patronize it. Good that they did that, so i hope this review helps you to avoid this store. üëç",

      "text": "The noodles were cooked al dente. Even though I asked for the dried chilli version, it did not taste spicy which was alright for me as I realised that one is not able to stomach spicy food as one ages.\n\nThe wanton was crispy with just a nice amount of filling which was chewy. The chef mistook my order of favourites as special. I think it was due to a language barrier. He was nice enough to recook it for me though as I would really love the soft boiled egg. It added much umami flavour to the noodles.",
