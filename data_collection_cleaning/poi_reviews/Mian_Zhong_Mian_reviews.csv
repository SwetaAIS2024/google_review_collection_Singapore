Mr A,3,"So many 5 star reviews a bit sus.

$5 for the starter dish, a bit exp.
Noodles is good quality, everything else average and typical.

3/5. (Probably giving slightly lower to counter the inflated rating - maybe it's 3.5 at best).",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113269740994000904590/reviews

Shikuroneko Chan,5,"All the bad reviews either too high expectations or just have been eating shit wanton their whole life they couldn't tell this one is good or yall's taste is just bad in general LOL. Anyways! Best wanton I ever had, always ordered number 1 with crispy wanton on the side, love how springy and tasty the noodles are as well as the sauce and soup! This place is an hour bus ride from where I live but it's worth it because I love the taste :]",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104098249975899203147/reviews
城川剣崎（Spidey48sg）,2,"Probably one of the most tasteless noodle dishes I have eaten recently.
Cannot trust all the 5 star review.
Ordered the mushroom noodle for $6, a little bit too expensive, mushroom was bland with no taste. Noodle was okay but really lack of flavor",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115379946730559255560/reviews
