Guy Greenshtein,5,"Found this gem randomly while looking for nearby coffee places. Decided to give it a try and I’m so lucky I did - this places is amazing!
Beautiful decor, great ambience, super friendly and helpful staff, chill music and the atmosphere is just what you need for a quiet morning or a business meeting.
The cold brew black and the homemade granola were excellent.
Definitely will go back there again!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110797210732574784088/reviews
YL Tan,4,"Tastefully decorated cafe offering some food and beverage. Menu not extensive probably because their main business is the member club above them.

fabio pesenti,5,"Incredible atmosphere and ambient. Relaxing and a bit sophisticated. Very quiet to have work conversations.
Quite limited selection in the menu, it looks like it is mostly frequented by the upstair club members.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117764528049040077417/reviews

Isabella Tan,5,A place with a touch of style. The ambience & service of the place reflected that. Taste of food was definitely worth the price though it’s on the up side. Service staff was well-mannered & professional.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113398650842009150847/reviews
