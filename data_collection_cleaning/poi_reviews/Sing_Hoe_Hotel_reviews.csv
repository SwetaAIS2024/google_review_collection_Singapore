Latasha Peltz,1,"If I could give 0 starts I would. Starting with the receptionist who barely looked up from the desk during check in to the dirty and cluttered ""lobby"", our room was a disgusting cigarette smell that had not really been clean,  toothpaste and smudges all over the mirrors, previous persons toothbrush beside the toilet, and pee all over the toilet seat. A very thin hole filled blanket was provided with a hard leather plastic pillow, and a box spring mattress. Mo real working AC(when I asked for the ace remote they were unable to give one that worked) or windows that opened, I'd that doesn't keep you awake, the phone in the room ringing all night or the very loud staff will, no barrier from other customers running water or the phones outside. The whole place felt like a jail more than a ""hotel"" , upon check out a HUGE rat ran across the lobby and the front desk couldn't even call us a cab to the airport even though they have it marked that they do airport transport!  Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere pictures are not what you get and this place is gross!!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114000990854895396653/reviews
Tanvir Hossain,1,"Terrible, the property is super old, dirty and too small. Look like a horror house, perfect for shooting films but not 1% standard for leaving. I booked from agoda for two adult and one infant. the reception clearly said that they donâ€™t allow baby, so my question is why they take booking  from online. I clearly add the filter on agoda for baby and they show me the properly. Think twice before you book this horror home.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110094776952975194360/reviews
CK C,5,"Beautifully preserved heritage building, at least from the outside. It appears to have been renamed as Mountbatten Hotel. Not sure if it is currently in business as the gates were locked.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Nikolaj Petersen,4,"If you are into historic buildings this hotel has it with peranakan friezes of symbolic animals decorating the front entrance (see if you can spot the merlions), and tainted glass windows in every room. The staff is good natured aswell but it's not for the sqimish or those who prefer to be excluded from the myriad of apperences in the world.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118202434859319838456/reviews
Belle Ng,4,"Room is cosy with old fashioned wall paper. Overall condition is good, value for money. There is no hotel with attached bathroom at this pricing.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115037046790274686606/reviews
