Big Willie,5,"Have been patronizing this place for years. We are probably visiting them at least once a month. Honestly, the ambience is not the attractive part. It is a bit old-school if that matters.

However, the food is really not too bad and pricing are also pretty alright.

Will I be back again? Yes. Both they're dimsum and dinner are great in my honest opinion. üåü",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106109863968118682802/reviews
Tot2travel WP,4,"Overall 4‚òÜ for service.

Food was a mix of good and average dishes. CNY menu with somewhat wallet friendly price.

Service by the waitresses most of the time was prompt, sometimes able to locate them. Restaurant was perhaps fully occupied during the 1st session.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109058897885515300830/reviews
Angie Ling,4,"We always have dimsum here, so we are here to try the dinner menu. Food was not too bad. Brinjal with minced meat was the best. The char siew was not bad too, not too much fats. Quite worth it to come here for dinner.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115912021747467223459/reviews

John Tango,4,"Wide selection of dim sum. Some of the dum were really good like the siew mai with prawn on top (9/10) (minced pork wrapped in wanton skin opened face), char siew pork steamed bun at 8.25/10. I will let the pictures do the talking. The pei-tan chok (century year old egg with shredded pork porridge) at 8.5/10 üëçüèº a but watery but loaded with ingredients.

Service good, nice Chrysanthemum tea. All the dim sum came out within 5 mins.

A repeat for sure, repeat factor 4/5.
