      "text": "Pandan Reservoir Park in Jurong offers a serene 6 km loop trail around its calm waters, perfect for jogging, walking, or cycling. I wouldnâ€™t call it a park in the traditional sense, but itâ€™s a great trail for those looking to get some exercise in a peaceful setting.\n\nWhile the path lacks shade, visiting during early mornings or late afternoons makes for a more comfortable experience. Itâ€™s also great for catching the sunrise or sunset, with beautiful open views across the reservoir. Amenities are limited, so bringing your own water is advisable. Benches along the trail offer spots to rest and enjoy the open surroundings. A solid choice for outdoor enthusiasts!",

There is an observation deck with ample empty sitting nests, and a huge shelter covering the premises with access to toilets nearby.\n\nThere are bus services from Jurong East (143 or 143M) and Jurong Town Hall (78 and 79) to West Coast Road bus stops serving Blocks 31 to Block 47 of Teban Gardens.

      "text": "Review written on: 10 October 2021\nThe entire perimeter around the reservoir is about 6.2 km. The track is gravels of rocks (nice crunching sound) and its a different feeling compared to the regular running tracks. There are shelters provided along the track. However, there is no shelter from trees and its a very open space.\n\nIf you plan to take a stroll or a run in the mornings, time it accordingly (6.2 km) to avoid the hot sun. Water fountain and washroom is provided near on end of the track. I think evenings would be better for photography if you are into capturing Street lamps. I started my run a bit late in the morning and mid-way, the sun got out and the running was no longer enjoyable.\n\nThe view is beautiful. Sit along some of the benches provided and take time to enjoy the view.",
