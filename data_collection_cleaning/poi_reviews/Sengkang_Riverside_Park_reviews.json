Lush greenery, calm waters, and the beautiful floating wetland made it feel like a quiet little world tucked right into the city.\n\nThe fruit-themed boardwalk and constructed wetlands were a nice surpriseâ€”spotted a few birds and dragonflies along the way too. Great place for a slow walk, a bit of reflection, or just a breather from the usual routine.\n\nGrateful for spaces like this that offer peace so close to home.",

Quite accessible from Senkang sports centre. There are toilets, a water fountain and a restaurant, although this was closed when we went in the morning.",
