Stephen Santosa,5,"A nice small neighborhood station.
The station is quite old for Singapore standard but it is clean and tidy. There is only an exit bound for each side of the main road. One of the exit is under the V Hotel Lavender and acces to the hotel entrance is fully covered so it is very comfortable. Right in the station entrance also have a small new hawker center which offer a reasonable price food.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103701872811560008224/reviews
