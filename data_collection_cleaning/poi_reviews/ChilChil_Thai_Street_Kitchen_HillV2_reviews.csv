Betty Nerissa K,4,"Good variety of individually portioned meals. I had the Creamy Basil Pork Omelette with Rice. Visited off peak and my food arrived very quickly. Authentic flavour, lovely textures and a hearty portion was served.Not overly salty or spicy.  I had the regular spice level which I found to be just slightly tingly. There are options for less spicy and non-spicy versions.
The service staff are friendly, attentive and helpful. I was asked about my preferred sugar level for my milk tea, and my dessert was served soon after I finished my main without having to request for it.
I had the Thai Red Ruby dessert. The ice is on the coarser side but the portion or red rubies is generous enough. I'd have it served earlier in the future",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106721474949422687288/reviews
XY W,2,"Tom yum soup was neither thick nor spicy. And it took half an hour to be served.
Staff are nice. But the service was very slow, as if weâ€™re in Thailand.
The fried pork too fat and super oily.
chicken wings and fried rice ok.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102685641316494468747/reviews
Ma tt,2,"Food: Appearance of the food looked nice, but the seafood mama was overly salty, making it hard to finish the plate of noodles. The Thai milktea though was rich and flavourful.

Service and ambience: I was assigned to a seat and food was subsequently served, but when a large family came in, I was requested to move to another table. This could have been prevented with better planning and allocating of seats, and that really affected the dining experience. To make matter worst, the family was creating so much noise, with the 5-6 teens yelling and shouting as though it was a market place, but staff took no action to remind them about the need to lower their volume.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102382313505418526836/reviews
Sairam Subramanian,4,"Both me and my wife love Thai street food so decided to give this a try.
We ordered Papaya salad, this has been our favorite ever since our trip to Koh Samui. And for mains - we went with Thai Basil Chicken and some Rice and Tofu curry ( don't remember the exact thing ).
Everything was good but I felt there was scope to be even better. Esp our benchmark was the street food in Thailand itself which is a high bar to beat. So I'd give this a 4/5.
Service was ok, you order on phone and you get the order in 10-15 mins. Ambience was trying to give Thai street food vibes.. small tables a bit too close.. Overall worth a visit for sure..",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115140538874299582015/reviews
Jas Ng,4,"The chef seemed to have been overly cautious with the seasonings, which was a bit disappointing. Most of the dishes were quite bland, particularly the prawn donuts, which were completely tasteless.

Over-adjusting the flavors to cater to health-conscious preferences will definitely lose those customers who appreciate the authentic and original taste of the cuisine.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112424484401348307288/reviews
