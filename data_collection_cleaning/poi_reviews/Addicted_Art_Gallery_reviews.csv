Simon Richards,5,"A fantastic gallery where you can buy online or make an appointment to view the artwork in person. Blair and Elena are really friendly and helpful and always go the extra mile.  We have bought a number of pieces from them, as have our friends, and we can highly recommend them.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107596736061663377996/reviews
Neil Hann,5,"Blair at Addicted Art Gallery has been very helpful and informative when I purchased a beautiful Limited Edition Sara Pope print. Blair promptly answered any queries or questions I had and I have received regular updates about the shipping status of my purchase. Blair has really taken the time to make my custom feel valued, I was even emailed pictures of how my print has been carefully and protectively packaged! As a keen art lover, collector and gallery trained picture framer I can honestly say it isn’t often you receive such a fantastic customer experience and I have purchased, collected and dealt with a lot of art over the last 20+ years for myself and for clients. Rarely, if ever, have I received such a warm and friendly service when purchasing art. I certainly wouldn’t hesitate to purchase art from Addicted Art Gallery again and I look forward to making further purchases in future. In fact it will be the first place I look!! I am UK based and Blair has kept me fully updated while the limited edition print I purchased makes its way to me, it really isn’t often you receive such amazing service, it is refreshing to have such personal and professional service. The delivery time is excellent, I’ve had to wait longer for pieces to arrive from UK based art dealers & suppliers so I can truly say that I’m delighted with everything that Blair and Addicted Art Gallery have done to make my purchase experience an exceptional one! Keep up the good work. 100% recommended!!!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100209034439596087399/reviews
