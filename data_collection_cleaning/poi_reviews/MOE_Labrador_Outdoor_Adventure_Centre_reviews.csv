Charlene Tang (Taonansch),4,It is very fun and the obstacles were challenging. Also the aunty there I think she‚Äôs in charge of the cleanliness she either got serious anger issues or just hate everyone. She scream at me like:‚ÄùYOU THINK LIKE THAT IS CALLED CLEAN!!!!!‚Äù And yell at the mentor:‚ÄùI ALREADY GOT COMPLAIN THAT IT IS TOO HEAVY FROM THE SCHOOL THEN YOU STILL ASK THEM TO LIFT!!!!?‚Äù My mentors were super nice i.e. Mentor Haizel and Mentor Jamus. mentor Jamus was literally the best. He came up with my whole class cheer and almost the whole dance. He could also do push-ups in handstand position. The last meal was the best and the mentors were funny. The floor is very hard so it was lucky that we all brought sleeping bags. My dorm was so far away fro the toilet seat it took so long to walk back and forth. Overall it was a fun experience and I would go again.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108846457985222922083/reviews
Girltubefun,3,"It was a three-star for me as the campsite was ok and not ok. First, it was the food which was disgusting the eggs were very oily till you could test the oil. The dorms were ok just a bit dusty and the floor was rough. They only gave us a yoga mat to put on our sleeping bag. No showering in the morning which was disgusting. There was also a very rude aunty that scolded the students for no reason. A good thing is the coaches were very kind. Coach Jennel and Coach APS if you see this you guys were the best coaches.
