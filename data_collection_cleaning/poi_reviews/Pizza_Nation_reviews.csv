V H (Purplepotarto),1,"Pizza don’t lousy. Food was cold . Ask
Them to make hot they just superficially put in the microwave in a stack . Come out
Our pizza still cold. Zero
Service. Bad attitude. Don’t
Even give one napkins, cutlery. Nothing. Give u a stare when u ask for napkins

Don’t even go near. Waste of money !",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105041711298836968116/reviews
Aashmika Varma,3,"Quite a disappointing pizza place at Tampines.

From the looks of it, this place looked really good, but when we got a couple of slices from their stall, we were taken aback by how cold the pizzas were and they didn’t taste fresh.

Additionally, if I wouldn’t have gone to get tissues, I wouldn’t have realised that they give out powdered cheese and chilli flakes in sachets which could’ve been given with the pizzas itself.

I would give this place the benefit of doubt that maybe they didn’t have fresh pizzas as we came around 8, but despite that, I’ve had better pizzas at that hour in other restaurants!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104152931382854540911/reviews
Yingying,4,Portion for pizza was alright but i was quite surprised that the pizza was very soft. Would suggest to improve the onion rings because it was expensive for a small portion that looks undercooked.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117289079780130956871/reviews
Danny Singh,1,Horrible food. Not worth the price and effort to go there. Lasagna was soggy and tasteless. Pizza was nothing more than just crust.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103674866318996100395/reviews
F H,1,"Why do their pizzas's not feel like pizza. The base tastes undercooked. The pepperoni pizza was too salty, and the toppings are flimsy too. Seasoning is non-existent.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115420135477229327733/reviews
