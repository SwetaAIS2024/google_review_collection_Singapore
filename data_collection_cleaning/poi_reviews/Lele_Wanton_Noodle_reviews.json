      "text": "Ordered $4.50 wanton noodle. Waited abit due to online order. Price is above market rate.\n\nNoodle : good\nWanton : great\nChar siew : poor\nPork lard : welcome\nSoup : average\n\nNoodle is springy and q but just slightly undercooked resulting it being slighting difficult to bit. Taste was great and also goes well when dipped into the soup. The amount was really a lot. I would rather they have a $4 or $3.50 option with lesser noodle.\n\nBoth fried and soup wanton was great. Especially the fried wanton which has a butter taste to it. Soup wanton was silky with reasonable amount of pork.\n\nCha siew was tough cut. Very typical of wanton noodle. Lack fat.\n\nThere was a few small pieces of pork lard which is still crispy, a welcome dimension.\n\nSoup just usual but it does goes well with the noodle.\n\nAfterthought... I did feel that it is kinda oily after eating",

      "text": "Have been here at Tanjong Rhu Wantonn Mee at Old Airport Road countless times and I must say, it was an absolute delight. This hidden gem is a testament to the incredible flavors that can be found in hawker stalls.\n\nI like the thin yellow noodles they use. They are perfectly cooked to achieve that ideal balance of chewiness and tenderness, and they soak up the flavors of the broth beautifully.\n\nSpeaking of flavors, the wanton mee here is packed with an explosion of taste. The combination of the savory broth and the succulent dumplings is pure perfection.\n\nThe ambiance is classic hawker center, and the service is quick and friendly. It's an ideal spot for a quick and satisfying meal. Whether you're a local or a visitor, Tanjong Rhu Wanton mee is a must-visit for anyone looking to experience the authentic taste of Singaporean cuisine. I highly recommend it for its exceptional flavors and those delectable thin noodles! Furthermore, prices are very reasonable and friendly to the wallet.\n\nThis is one of my top few wanton mee in Singapore.",

      "text": "Love this wanton mee at an old school coffeeshop. The food here is consistently good. There is always a short queue but they are very fast. The char siew is not very fatty yet is very tender. The star of this is the noodle texture as it’s not your usual Singaporean style - it’s closer to the qq Hong Kong style but also not quite, which makes it very unique.\n\nThey are on Grabfood but do try to dine in here as the takeaway version doesn’t travel well nor does this place justice!",
