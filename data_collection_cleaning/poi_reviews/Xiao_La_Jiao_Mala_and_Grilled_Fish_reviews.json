But I waited for 20 mins, and I saw at least 5 dining in customers collected plus other grab food delivery orders.\n\nTurns out my mala costed $17… It’s literally the same price as ordering the same things from Zhang Liang or Yang Guo Fu who are known for being expensive. Won’t patronise this stall again because of the price and not very nice service.",
