Empowering Mindset,4,"Great place to grab a meal. Food pretty good. But if you like quiet place, this is not a choice. Had a sandwich and the portion is really big. If you are small eater, you can share with 2 pax.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113009080732159136694/reviews
Ben Lim,2,"Order a carbonara, Grilled chicken quesadilla and Kurb truffle fries. Food wise is nice and delicious. While having our truffle fries, staff came and took away our utensils and plate and claims that he needs to wash??? And ask us to use hand instead. OMG. Grab our coffees and left with an unpleasant lunch.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114634161751316881038/reviews
Leia,4,"Good sandwiches and convenient for people working in the offices nearby.
I ordered the vegetarian sandwich ($12) and enjoyed it. I wish they gave more slaw and tomatoes. The ciabatta was lovely and fluffy. Pesto was great.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107339312369387349595/reviews
Korrine Koh,4,"The carbonara was really good, it wasnâ€™t too creamy and had a generous serving of bacon and mushrooms.

The truffle mushroom pizza was decent but the cheese was a bit too over powering and couldnâ€™t taste the truffle ðŸ¥²

The tropical blast ice blended drink was really good and refreshing on a hot day ðŸ¥°",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114709937084710063438/reviews
Sherman Guo,5,"Another outlet in Alexandra! If you are a cheese enthusiastic, must try out the mac and cheese! Melted in your mouth instantly.

The food is quality filled but unfortunately wish they could have opened more outlets, especially in the north east",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111501684253323725493/reviews
