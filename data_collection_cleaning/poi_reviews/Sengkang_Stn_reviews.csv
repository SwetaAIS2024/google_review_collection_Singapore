Daryl Bay (Ah Bay),1,Nice place. Lousy and packed busses. Single decks during peak hours. Prepare early or you cant board. Fight for your life people!!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116879265180627438463/reviews
J Lee,2,"Here’s one of the rare cases where urban design authorities seemed to have dropped the ball on foresight.

This diminutive bus stop was built way too tiny for the community that it was meant to serve. With Sengkang already earmarked as a major new town, and a yuppie generation of urban commuters guaranteeing to gather here during rush hours - so much more could’ve been factored into the expansion of this important bus stop’s capacity/size in the early planning stages, to mitigate the mind-numbing overcrowding that takes place here daily today.

To add on to the discomfort of commuter overload, the narrow walkway is also frequented by PMD riders, weighing on to the overall detriment of the commuting experience during peak hours. Avoid where possible.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104959184886426332756/reviews
