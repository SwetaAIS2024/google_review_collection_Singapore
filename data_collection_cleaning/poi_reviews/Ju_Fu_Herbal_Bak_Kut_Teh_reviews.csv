Cheong Jun Kai,5,"Have been ordering and just loving the Ban Mian here 😍, the fragrance, texture and the taste is quite different from other stores that I tried at.

One of the places that I would definitely recommend people to try at 🙂

犬熊玉,1,"Be careful when paying. The stall tender a Young prc lady is dishonest. I ask for non container all plastic can liao when tabao she look disappointed because cannot earn from container money.
When paynow that time she told me 15.3. I key in 15.3 and let her see first before pressing she never say anything. After i paid she say aiya is $15. She scoop some ikan bilis to compensate me instead of refunding. But the ikan bilis is misery portion
I see 30 cents only she also so hardup want to cheat just treat it as donation never argue with her take my stuffs and go.
I vaguely remember there was one time she also did the same stunt this time she did again.

Benny,1,"Ordered their pig trotter and probably the worst I've ever had in Singapore. Meat is tough and doesn't taste fresh, braised sauce is tasteless. Only had 2 pieces and threw away the rest. At this standard, i would recommend they close down the stall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101930206305619107566/reviews
