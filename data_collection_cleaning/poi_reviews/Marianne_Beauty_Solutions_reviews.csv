Sharmaine N,5,"I first stepped into MB in my early 20s when my acne was causing me to lose my confidence. I took a leap of faith because I had no recommendation from anyone on whether MB was any good or whether they were out to dupe me. 10 years on, I'm still going back there for facials and skincare products and massages because the owner Julie and her team understands my skin and I've seen results. It's not easy trusting a beauty salon but the team has shown that they are committed to providing quality care. This is not a sponsored post but rather to share my experience and to give a shoutout to this nondescript salon in the heartlands that have helped me so much over the years. Thank you Julie (:",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105931719640257508969/reviews
Regina See,5,"Since 1986, I have been with Marianne Beauty since my early thirties & continue with them for over 34 years because of their dedicated quality service & commitment.

My skin underwent different changes from my 30s to 60s. At every stage, I know I could depend on them to help my skin.

I am satisfied with my face contour, reduced pigmentation and expression lines reduced. Appreciate the team at Marianne Beauty for going through my homecare steps during my monthly visits to ensure my skin is well looked after at home too!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115648868693035217765/reviews
Li Ping Tan,5,"A regular for 3+ years... Julie and her team always recommend the best treatments for my skin and painstakingly explain every step as well. My face continues to be very firm and supple all these years, and has not aged much. Really like their non-invasive facials/ treatments. :)",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116280347932224023316/reviews
