      "text": "I have been to a few clinics in Singapore for a number of different treatments and Astute is by far the best and the only one I will stick with.  The staff are so welcoming and friendly. They really make sure you are comfortable and happy throughout the whole process.\n\nRecently I was treated by Dr Jason and he was very open and honest with all my requests. He talked me through all the information and offered the best procedures for the best results. I would highly recommend him.\n\nI love the little extras they give you with every treatment, Averlyn and Bernice could not want to help you more. There is no pressure for up selling, but they offer recommendations and samples should you want to try new products.\n\nThey offer really reasonable prices for the services they offer.\n\nHighly recommend this clinic for all your aesthetic and wellbeing requests.",
