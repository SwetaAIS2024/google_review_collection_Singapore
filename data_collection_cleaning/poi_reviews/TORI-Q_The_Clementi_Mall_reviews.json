Meat was grilled to perfection without being too dry. Economical in my opinion as well considering the quality of their ingredients.",

They are ok to add additional sauce onto the rice when my wife requested. The food is is comfort food. The rice servicing is generous and I love the pickles although having some takuan will really be awesome. All the grilled stuff that we ordered tasted great even though we just had dinner at Eng Heritage. The place is small but no one seems to be eating in, so we had the whole counter to ourselves. Will definitely be back.",
