SLim,5,"Choy Huat Hong Kong Roast has shifted to Blk 5036 AMK Industrial Park 2. Stall & owner were formerly from Sims Drive, with their own supporters.

We ordered de roast duck, roast pork, chicken and charsiew. Each item was well prepared. We particularly like de skin from de duck, which was so aromatic and crispy. The roast pork was skillfully done with the nice crackling skin, which is only available at restaurants. We also like de savoury sauce, which compliments the rice and meat well.

Price is reasonable too. Owner is quite pro and would deliver de part of meat you request. Really enjoyed my lunch and will definitely be back.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105464416699709160877/reviews

Josh Lim,5,"Dec 2020. Ordered chicken drumstick and char siew rice. Everything from the rice to the chicken and char siew tasted good. I preferred the char siew actually! Added a dollar for a small bowl of brewed soup. $6 in total.

Took away on May 21. Duck and Char Siew noodles. $5.20. The duck is really nice. Fatty and tender. Char Siew is nice too.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100606910212221946176/reviews
Mark L,5,Ordered a plate of roast pork and Char Siew rice. Both roast pork and Char Siew's taste are out of this world. It has a smoky roast flavour and the fats are rendered nicely.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110892887847155971466/reviews
