P Xue Wen,1,"The VTM doesn't allow user to unlock card pin, despite the DBS staff can see the actual person and their proper documentation to prove it. Was advised by DBS staff that the VTM can be used to unlock the pin. However the VTM DBS staff said he can't process it and advised us to go back to their branch to do it. Wasted my trip here! It is ridiculous.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101130719289237139014/reviews
