Deon Burger,5,"A very nice new windsurfing/supping and surfski club - very friendly personal - even if there is no wind - it’s a great place to hang out, grab a beer and wait for the wind :)",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105839681272078124638/reviews
Mely Tho,3,"I do enjoy the scenery and beach activities ambience (its 4 stars) , the manager is friendly and helpful but not a young man with a big hair, he made my smoothies with a bit of attitude (Sunday 6th Nov). But I still come to this place but just concerned with this kind of service. My suggestion just don’t work if not in the mood, my smoothies taste like water",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116489598634967256439/reviews
Raghav Kumar,5,"Wonderful place to relax and chill with a beer. Beers are wonderful and also they have non-alcoholic drinks. The person who runs the place is really friendly and kind because, he gave us superb hospitality. He even gave us complimentary bar bites as we were the first few to enter the bar. He even moved all his furnitures for me as i was in a wheelchair. Very nice people working in the bar. I strongly recommend this bar.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116026662062333725953/reviews
