The management team is truly dedicated to ensuring a seamless onboarding experience for new employees, and itâ€™s clear they take pride in finding the right fit for both the institution and the candidate.\n\nThe staff members were exceptionally welcoming, making me feel comfortable and valued every step of the way.

The management is highly approachable and open to feedback, which creates a positive, nurturing work environment.\n\nOverall, Victoria World Academy is not just a place of work but a community where each personâ€™s contributions are valued and celebrated.

So many people leave early or ditch class, and bullying is everywhere. The school does absolutely nothing about itâ€”in fact, they even gang up on students who want to transfer!",
