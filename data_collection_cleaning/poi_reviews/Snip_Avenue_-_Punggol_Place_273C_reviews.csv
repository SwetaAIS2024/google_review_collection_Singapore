Paul Toh,4,This is a no frills hair cut place. Very quick action and turnover is very fast. Very hardworking hairdressers here. Price is very reasonable. I‚Äôve got a package for $48 for 12 haircuts! Nowhere is cheaper than this!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110584107240453374/reviews

Bite Nooob,1,"I want to complain about one of the workers there, female and blond hair. For some reason whenever she cuts my hair, she messes it up. Usually other people there cut my hair wont like that one! First time i went there the lady cut halfway then she disappeared to the back, only came back after 10 mins, then the haircut also ugly! The front was too short even though said slightly above eyebrow, but then she cut 3cm above eyebrow. like hello? you OK or not??? another time i went there and she cut my hair, i CLEARLY stated cut till eyebrows 3 TIMES!!! she didnt bother, and then she still cut above the eyebrows by 3cm. This lady damn stubborn sia. say one thing dunno how to listen one.! one simple instruction also cant follow, say something also dont want to listen! HIGHLY HIGHLY dont recommend this place unless you want a shitty haircut!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102126187479796721376/reviews
