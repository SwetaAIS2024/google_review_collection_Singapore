I should have probably read some of the Google Reviews about this place being CASH ONLY. I only knew this when I got to the front of the line to order. The nearest ATM was not that close, so I had to give this a miss this time. This review is based on reputation and I'll have to come back another day with CASH",

I guess she loves it..\n\nWas shocked to know the ginko nut bean curd is $4.20 per bowl but it was worth it I guess? Full of bean curd and it‚Äôs yummy too.. just little over the price ya?\n\nCoffee shop with no air cond and some guys were smoking outside and you can smell the smokes‚Ä¶  I was perspiring and had to change  to the table under the fan‚Ä¶\nTables were were ok ok clean but not 100% clean as I spotted ants..maybe they should get pest control to fix that issue..\n\nStill gave a 5* as I am still thinking about the ginko bean curd after some time üòÇ .. not sure if their other outlets are selling this too‚Ä¶will check out the outlets near my house..\n\nOh ya, didn‚Äôt have to Q and many tables / seats available as it‚Äôs 3pm on Sat..",

The shop isn't very big nor it is conducive if you have infants\n\nI recommend their teh, kopi and roasted bread with Kaya butter. Comforting stuffs! Their nasi lemak sambal is dark in colour - it was spicy with a little sweetness with it. This nasi lemak is same same but different than the ones in Malaysia's, I added otah towards it and I enjoyed it",
