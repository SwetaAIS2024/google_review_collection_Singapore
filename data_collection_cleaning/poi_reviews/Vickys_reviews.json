Sounds & looks very average, but actually hits all the right notes. A good cake to eat regularly (if not for the price).  Good job!",

      "text": "Bought a chocolate fudge cake at Bukit Timah Plaza. Asked to take a look at their cakes as all their cakes are in a sealed box kept in the fridge. None was displayed on the glass shelf. The middle aged female staff replied coldly, \"All our cakes are the same\". Home, opened the box, found a shoddy cake with 3 iron press-like on the frosting. Which you can see in the picture. I don't know how you can bring yourself to sell this kind of cake to customers. The appearance of this cake looks far worse than the cakes selling in supermarkets and cake shops below HDB. For the price of your cake, shouldn't you show more sincerity to your customers? Also, the cake has no chocolate taste or smell at all.",
