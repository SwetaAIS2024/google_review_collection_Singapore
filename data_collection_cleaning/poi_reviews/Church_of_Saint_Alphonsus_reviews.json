Kudos to the Ushers, Eucharistic ministers and altar service boys.\n\nThe mass was very well organised.\nThe congregation was seen taking part in the Eucharistic celebration enthusiastically.\n\nI was moved by the devotion of the parishioners who turned up in very large numbers.\n\nIf you are looking to attend mass please be there at this church at least half an hour before mass begins, since it fills up pretty quick!",

It offers a place of sanctuary, reflection, and contemplation, even for non-Christians. It definitely can get very busy during Mass timings on the weekend, so be prepared to go early. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª",
