They are the only people who I trust for my wedding gowns alterations or any alterations.\n\nThey fulfilled my wish of having the corset design without the hassle of tying it. Look how pretty the back is! They also modified my tea ceremony gown and it fits perfectly.\n\nHighly recommended!",

She saved my sister's wedding outfit, which had gotten too tight over the Covid period and required major surgery to open up so that it would be comfortable for the long wedding dinner and dancing. Auntie came up with a new idea that revamp the back of the outfit by using spare fabric from a ribbon to create a dummy back and loops. It ended up looking possibly even better than the original! And she did it in just a couple days for a very reasonable price. Thank you so much!!",
