Mutton was little and the dough portion was hard.\n\nThe Roti John wasn‚Äôt very good either. Just comes with lots of cheese, and served with fries and a side of mutton. The Roti John was more bread than egg.",

The mee goreng is done pretty well, abit charred kind which adds alot of flavour (some like it some don't), don't really like the cheese fries and mutton that comes with it.\n\n24042021",
