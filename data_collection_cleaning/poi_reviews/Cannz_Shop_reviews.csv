Thomas Yee,1,"Paid $500 to remove spots on my face, valid for a year. After three months still many spots on my face. Many excuses such as cannot do the same spot twice, cannot do close to hairline, etc. Before payment guaranteed she ll do a good job. Kept pushing me very expensive products which does not help much. Small bottle of acne lotion cost $80! Suntan lotion $80! Beware.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114822884816548050777/reviews
