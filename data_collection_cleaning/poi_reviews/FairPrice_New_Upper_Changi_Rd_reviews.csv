BM,5,"Small but well-stocked place with friendly staff. In particular would like to applaud Ms Nurbidayati , a long-time staff and cashier at this outlet. She is always friendly and patient, and goes the extra mile to dispense freebies if we are entitled to them. We would even deliberately wait for her until she is available to check out. Sheâ€™s the best!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107834610102428194935/reviews
Chia Joel,4,"2 story 24 hours supermarket with almost everything you need, although quality wise it's a little lower than the one nearby at bedok mall.

They import in tesco products and all which is amazing and makes me so happy! Excellent staff and self service check out makes everything a breeze!

Great place to be at always!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111915444317413676016/reviews
