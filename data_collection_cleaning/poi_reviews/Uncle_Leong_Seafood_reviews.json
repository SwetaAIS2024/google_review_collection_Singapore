It has only ceiling fans to keep the place cool.\n\nü•¢ Service is generally friendly and efficient. üüß The prices are also very reasonable for a good seafood restaurant of this quality.\n\nüü® I have also included some throwback photos of the dishes we had eaten in the past during family dinner celebrations.",
