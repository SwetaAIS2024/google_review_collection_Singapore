LY,3,"Ordered an Americano, but the taste was strange‚Äîhard to describe. I wondered if the coffee machine was properly cleaned. As a coffee lover, this was a first for me, though it might just be my personal preference.

On a positive note, the environment was chill and relaxing, with a pool nearby. Sitting indoors was comfortable and inspiring, especially with the view of the pool water.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104856792036026895869/reviews
ItsJaycee Zhuang,5,"We went after rain, it was kind of cosy and chilling. Not many people were in the cafe so we tend to allowed to chill longer time.

The waffle is crispy, however the drinks were soso for me. The hospitality is great and I would come again!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112100541913838236784/reviews
wuan ng,4,"I brought my niece here for her swimming lesson and spotted this little caf√© nearby.

TCH,3,"1st time to this cafe in Horizon Hills Poolside Cafe.

The place is nice, however service can be improved.  Our orders took quite awhile to be served.

22LR,5,"It is just near the pool so we just came to have a bite before we swim. The food is very nice. They have curry, belgium chocolate, etc. I love the fact you can have 10% discount with membership hhgcc. The interior is very well done and the price is just ok.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115896141034540831883/reviews
