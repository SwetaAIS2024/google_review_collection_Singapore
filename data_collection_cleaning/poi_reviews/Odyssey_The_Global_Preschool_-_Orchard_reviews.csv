Vivienne Chen,5,"I like the school very much, given the very central location, it's a kind of luxury to have a decent size of area for outdoor activities so that the kids can enjoy the fresh air and some sunlight. The teachers and admin staff are kind, patient and caring, one amazing part is that they can remember the names of all the kids in the school accurately. The school has its own kitchen with amazing chefs, my kid loves the food there and even ask me to get the recipe and make it at home. Personally I'm very happy with the school and my kid also enjoys the time at school.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112904148948119734900/reviews
Patricia Alves de Araujo,5,"I fell my son is very happy at the school and I can see the way the kids learn is so playful and efficient at the same time. I was specially happy to see that Odyssey is doing all possible to adjust my son´s diet according to the restrictions that he has (gluten free and dairy free) without making him fell like he is different. Potty traininh has been a challenge for us, but the teachers are helping a lot in this process. We couldn´t be happier with our experience!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110191035692333392981/reviews

Willennium 2k,3,"Nice and pleasant from the outside. Brings back some modernity to this part of Killiney. This pre-school has potential just by its location. Hope to see more and will be back to review further once it opens in 2019.
April 2019 updated photographs. And it's opened for business.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110060552833264793514/reviews
Ling Koh,5,"I really like the preschool experience offered by Odyssey Orchard. The school grounds are nice and students get to play outdoors and enjoy some fresh air. There’s also a water play area and well-equipped art and music rooms. The school kitchen is helmed by awesome Chef Khaled who prepares tasty and nutritious food on-site for the children. Last but not least, there’s a great team of dedicated and friendly teaching staff taking care of the children.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108537641509039224318/reviews
