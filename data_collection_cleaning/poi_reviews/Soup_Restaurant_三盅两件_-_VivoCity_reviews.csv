N. Gan,5,"Soup Restaurant offers an attractive early bird promotion for orders placed before 4:59 PM. We placed our order at 4:50 PM, just in time to enjoy the 25% discount. We ordered their signature Samsui Chicken, which did not disappoint—it was served with a generous portion of ginger and was as flavorful as expected. We also had the Hometown Tofu, Qinglong vegetables, and sliced fish with spring onion and ginger. All the dishes were well-prepared, though we found the fish to be slightly fishy.

The attentive server quickly highlighted this to the Manager in Charge, Clement Sung, who responded promptly by bringing the dish back to the kitchen. Although the cook confirmed that the fish was indeed fresh, the Manager took full accountability and graciously offered a waiver since we had decided not to continue eating it. This thoughtful gesture was much appreciated.

Special mention goes to server Lee Yoke Chu, whose attentiveness stood out—she offered us ice cubes for our chrysanthemum tea and regularly checked if we needed a refill. Her warm and thoughtful service deserves recognition.

We highly recommend Soup Restaurant for its delicious food—served without the aftertaste of thirst—and for its genuinely welcoming and customer-focused service.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111536004756755931697/reviews

LLY,2,"The sweet and sour pork was highly disappointing! Many pieces of flour and the meat was not fresh tasting. Flavour was extremely plain and I get better quality at hawker centres.

Sweet potato leaf was just weird tasting. the sauce was Sickeningly sweet.

Mee sua was greasy and not tasty. There was chicken in it, and the texture was completely wrong, because it felt like something too soft and  gooey.

Chili sauce however was bery nice",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109532822556061355724/reviews
