Emi,1,"Such a terrible school, I'm a sec2 and i was an ex student in xingnan, I hated it there people could bully you and get away with it even if the whole school saw what's happening, i had one teacher who can't even teach properly and biased, that school left me so much trauma and bad memories it's no wonder your google ratings are so close to a 3 star. Not to mention i was in a dance cca when i was p3 and the lady there that taught us literally changed $50 for leggings that brakes immediately(it's so obvious it's cheaply made, scamming students to raise your shitty ass school funds is genuinely such a pathetic thing to do, they also fatshammed aswell. Your school is really pathetic and i know I'm not the only one with experiences like this. I'm not sure what's going on in that school right now but im speaking from my experience",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117911385833751224049/reviews
