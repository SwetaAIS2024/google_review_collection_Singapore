      "text": "Any tourist worth their salt should move along and give this outlet a miss.\n\nAs local regulars, we lament the drastic drop in standards both in food and service.\n\nThe quintessential order of kopi is now sadly diluted even when you request for it to be stronger aka 'gao'. And their once luscious golden lava egg tarts are now pallid, cold, and lacking in a decent amount of salted egg lava filling. They should also remove the word 'lava' because there's no flow, it's parched dry.\n\nLet's not even touch on the non-existent service unless an insolent glare from the oversized baboon behind the counter qualifies, expecting you to realize that it's now your turn to place your order?!\n\nThere's seriously not much going anymore for this outlet short of perhaps the water fountain view. This is yet another example of what you get from a business so at ease with its place in the market that caters to the uninformed tourist.",

Our repeated visits,  like the curry gravy, serving was generous, rice just nice,  coffee cup size large, can choose a variety of cakes, overall value for money, refer to bill attached.  Stall is just in front of FOOD REPUBLIC food court, easy to find.  Arrived at around 11am to avoid the lunch crowd.     CKL 28/08/2024 Wed 2031",

The staff are friendly even though they have to double up as cashier and coffee and tea maker. As for the buns, cakes and tarts, they taste normal. This outlet is just opposite Food Republic.",
