After taking out from the rice, dunno what the heck is this metal round flat metal part.\nThis is not the 1st time, previously is hair and small transparent plastic. ( Dunno how they passed their hygiene)\nTo all buyers, pls look carefully inside ur food before u eat. Sometimes u might not know it may have ‚Äúhidden gems‚Äù\nAnyway I have report to SFA for more investigations.",
