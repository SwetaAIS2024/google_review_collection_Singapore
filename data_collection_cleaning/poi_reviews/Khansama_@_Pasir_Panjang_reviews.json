I usually have low spice tolerance, but somehow, I managed to enjoy their spicy chicken‚Äîit was that good! Ended the meal with gulab jamun, which had just the right level of sweetness.\n\nWent here for the first time to celebrate my colleagues‚Äô promotions, and I‚Äôm glad I joined. Definitely coming back!",

      "text": "Went to to this North Indian joint for meal which is located withiin Alexander business park.\n\nHad the buffet, which was self service with the dishes. From nann, rice to curry & dessert. Decent variety of dishes. The mutton curry was flavorful, maybe more spicier would be pleasing. The bread was done in the premises, was served hot. Dishes were replenished frequently. Thought some dishes were interesting, as I wasn't sure what was the dish, I asked the staffs, one mentioned it was cheese and other said it was tofu..\n\nThe place was packed with people from the area during my visit. Fortunately I went prior the lunch crowd came. Friendly service staff.",

We took our Korean clients to this restaurant, and they loved the food and the atmosphere. They also have a bar attached to this restaurant, so you can order beers, liquors, and wines.  I have posted photos of the food and drink menu so one can get an idea of the items available as well as the cost. This place is good for a family dinner, friend gathering or a business dinner. All in all, a good place to have good food with an ambience and excellent service.",
