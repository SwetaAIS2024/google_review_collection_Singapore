Unfortunately it’s aged and badly needs a makeover.\n\nWorse though were the receptionists: upon arrival we were met by an unfriendly male who barely said hello, made zero eye-contact and was so disinterested that it seemed that we were putting him out; checkout was slightly better but only just - the woman was somewhat polite but definitely distant and disinterested! Very disappointing!\n\nI’d highly recommend never staying there!",

      "text": "Well located hotel a few streets over from the Sultan mosque with lots of restaurants nearby. The big con for us was the room was sooo small with literally no storage that with a cot, 2 suitcases and a pushchair it felt like literal chaos. The bed was also really creaky and we kept disturbing each other (and the baby) rolling over or going to the toilet in the night. There were steps in the corridor on the way to our room and the room was poorly noise insulated from noise in the corridor and adjacent rooms. It was windowless (we did know this on booking) which was fine as we assume the mosque may gave woken us up otherwise.",

It's walking distance to Kampong Glam, Sultan Mosque, Arab St., Haji Lane, up to Bugis St. And it's only a few blocks away from a local park and restaurants.\n\nAccessibility is also not a problem, there is a bus stop directly in front of the hotel.\n\nI was worried it might get noisy since our room was beside the road, but it has been quiet. But, I must say that the walls are quite thin. We can hear the 'action' beside our room. Lol.\n\nStaff were also friendly, we were warmly greeted by Eli at around 2am when we srrived to check-in. Overall, I recommend staying here and will definitely come back next time in Singapore.",

The staff is also good and accommodating. The location is great because it's close to places to eat and hang out! Plus, there's a bus stop right in front of the hotel. Overall, we had a good stay at this hotel!",
