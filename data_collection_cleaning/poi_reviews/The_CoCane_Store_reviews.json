Every time we are at the food centre, we will definitely order their Teh Tarik, never a taste of disappointment.\n\nOther cold drinks are equally good!\n\nAdditionally, it feels really warming to see the family run the Cocane Store, to see their closeness and happiness. :)",

I love this place for providing me with this experience but I can't help but resent them for the nihilism I now feel. Overall I recommend this place come here if ur in east coast pakr.",
