Baron Navadne,3,"My health screening took about two hours. Some negative points: the visit to the doctor seems very rushed for my taste. Relax man. It is very difficult to contact them on the phone. One has to talk to some call centre but even they cannot get hold of them. On the day before my checkup, I received a phone call asking me to confirm a test that I never requested. Positives: not much waiting time. There is a nice coffee machine and some thing to eat, although no real milk. The staff is mostly friendly and efficient, especially the nurses in charge of the tests.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103763140371509282221/reviews
M,1,"I would give 0 star considering the price I’ve paid. The female doctor on duty this morning is rushy, rude and lack of professionalism. It sounds like she has no love for the job. She kept asking me for my past medical screening done at another place despite I’ve already told her that it was a basic check up organised by my company and nothing critical has been discovered. All the info that needs to be disclosed is alr in the questionnaire, I don’t know why she needed to repeat the whole thing again like a bot. Some more asked me “Go find your past health screening report n see if you got any problems” as if she was gonna discover some serious illness. Just bother to read the questionnaire beforehand, go through the key points and make relevant suggestions… This is an absolute waste of time! I understand that you want to know the medical history of your patient but shouldn’t you be nice and have some empathy? When I asked whether it’s ok to add some other tests not included in the package, she was dismissive and just said it’s not necessary. Shouldn’t it be the customer whom is paying to decide what test to add on? She passed on a lot of nervous energy, making me feel extremely uncomfortable. She also kind of mocked me when I said I never had pap smear test done before. Definitely the worst experience ever among all the clinics I’ve visited throughout the years. Don’t come to this place if you are self paying. Go somewhere with better customer service.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107071158833238987236/reviews
Judith Cooks,1,"Extremely bad experience. Misrepresented on their invoice that they did spirometry and charged me for it. Then only tell me that the test is omitted because of COVID only after I questioned them why this particular test stated in the invoice was not done and by then i had already paid for it. Needless to say, they did not give any sort of refund for the test that they claim to perform on their invoice but actually did not perform. Their female doctor is very condescending and very poor customer experience. Pressured me to see her first and nt letting me eat after long hrs of fasting, then even ask me to close the door after her. I am the customer, i am paying her but she treats me like im her subordinate... please dont ever go to this place to do health screening. Many other options out there without pissing yourself off or starving yourself unnecessarily.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110598531750448309402/reviews
na nashi (huilian),5,"Screening completed around 1.5 hrs. Requested for female doctor and got my request. Friendly doctor and nurses. Breakfast provided is quite nice. Nice coffee and tea available.

However instructions on what to expect next could be clearer. For example provided a checklist on what to expect next.

Very poor mobile reception in premises. Wifi also needs to be improved, unable to connect even after entering OTP.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109065112149763472244/reviews
Eliane Lim,1,"Appointment took a long time to schedule. Emailed to customer service and only a few days later replied asking for more information. Provided answers to their question and a few days later ANOTHER customer service officer replied asking the same question. Finally called because I sent an email stating that they are SLOW and inefficient. Customer service officers are VERY RUDE and IMPATIENT TO TALK TO ME!

Came for the appointment, everything is about WAIT WAIT WAIT! Whole procedure took me 2and a half hours! Will NEVER come back here EVER!!!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102143636468747105062/reviews
