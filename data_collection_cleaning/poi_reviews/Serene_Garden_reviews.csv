ian tay rongde,5,Nice Chinese/Japanese style gardens. Didn't know of this place until recently. A relaxing place to walk through on a cooling day to pretend I am on holiday elsewhere. May be hot on sunny days though. There isn't as much tree cover.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117336937434831170483/reviews
