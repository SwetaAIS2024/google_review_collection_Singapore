YingSeah Tee,5,"如果要学唱歌，要找Colestudio。I look forward to the vocal lessons every week. Teacher is very encouraging and he makes the lessons fun. I can see his heart in wanting us to reach our potential and sing better. He is my second vocal teacher (way better than my previous one). He has good knowledge of music theory and techniques of singing. 2.5 mths of learning and the friends around me commented on my great improvement! if you want to learn singing, definitely recommend him!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115759728232546989242/reviews

Seedoflove,5,"I was being recommended to here through my friend. It's pretty challenging in Singapore to find a vox teacher who is patient and quick to solve our issues. I came with curiousity and guess what, Cai Laoshi was professional, sincere and understanding enough to answer all my questions!

Never painful to give it a try! Who knows this 'try' is actually a forward stepping stone in your singing passion? :-)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113814712571125803978/reviews
