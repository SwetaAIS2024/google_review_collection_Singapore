William Tan,3,"Clinic close for lunch at 12.30 pm to 2 pm. Will start to accept patient at 12.15 pm. Luckily i reach there at 12.10 pm and managed to register and see the doctor. Dr Loo is good, but not exam the patient in very detail. Probably i am just the normal cough and flu.

I am not fever, but i said i feel hot. The doctor was nice and also give me the fever medicine.

I claim the medic fee under company insurance. But if this is under personal payment, I would not suggest you to go. But for normal/general sick and claim under company insurance, you may consider. Doctor give A LOT medicinessss",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116142914043575788977/reviews

EM T,1,"I went to this clinic on 7 Oct 24 during lunch hour around 12 plus. So while I was waiting for my turn to register, I was trying to push the pen holder nearer to the desk as I saw it was going to drop. However, this reception lady gaves me a frustration tone that she though I was trying to write on a paper. As I ask her again what she was trying to say, she sound frustrated. Even when she told me today the doctor is a relieved doctor, her tone is not nice and sound frustrated. I don't see her treated other patient this way. What have I done wrong to deserve such treatment??? She didn't even call my name for the collection of medication. She called me ""Mdm"" in a unfriendly manner...and I didnt know i have to paid for the carrier.....Gosh!! Is this right? This is the first time I encounter this!

Most importantly,  the attitidue of your staff is not right that my experience feel awful! I will not recommend anyone to this clinic. Please train your staff to be polite and not to be judgmental!!!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111634060675983398545/reviews
