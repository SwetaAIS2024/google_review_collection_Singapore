Vvv Lee,5,"Drinks with reasonable priced and the staff are very friendly, especially QIQI, CHERISH & JIARONG. The KTV system is up-to-date with the latest songs and has an excellent sound system, so you can really enjoy your karaoke sessions. While you might have to wait a little if itâ€™s full house, the pool table is just $2 per game.

Thereâ€™s plenty of parking right outside the pub.
Highly recommend! :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105506371541048494642/reviews
