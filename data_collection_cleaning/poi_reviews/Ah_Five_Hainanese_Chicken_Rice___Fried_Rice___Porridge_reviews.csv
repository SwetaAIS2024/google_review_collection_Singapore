YY,5,"Came by for lunch on a weekend around 1pm and was glad to see that they still have some available although there‚Äôs no chicken on display anymore.

Ordered the breast and drumstick for me and my wife, and the bill came up to $12 - was fully aware that it‚Äôs rather pricey as compared to what was expected though.

üçö the rice was actually very amazing, it‚Äôs the kind of oily that I missed, a very nostalgic taste and made me want more as I go

üçó the chicken was tender and generous in serving, good enough for the price point

üå∂Ô∏è this one really hits, it was properly spicy on the first bite and actually was acceptable after, one of the better ones too.

Overall the dish was great because of the rice, and surprisingly because it‚Äôs a good kind of oily - must be that I enjoy that sesame oil, though my wife agrees it‚Äôs a full 5 stars too üëçüèª",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
Karl Cabral,5,"Their special chicken fried rice is still great after coming back a few years later!
Its perfect matched with their ginger, chili and thick soy sauce!

Still unbeatable in Singapore!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108881673773006999510/reviews
E Ang,4,"Tried this kampong chicken for the first time and the chicken is tender and chewy and cooked just nice and very flavorful for the chicken. Except that it is a bit pricey at half chicken for 28$ and one bird cost 38$. Except if you have liking for the liver and gizzards, this is offered as add on with no charge. This is definitely a good place for chicken rice if you are fancy for kampong chicken.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115825785627776666543/reviews
HC Denton,5,"I went here after watching the Chicken Rice stall testing youtube video of Angel Hsu and consulting the comprehensive excel list she published, with data of more than 100 Chicken Rice stalls in Singapore, including taste and hygiene (e.coli, lower is better ;p) Wow! That list is really nice, so much effort to compile it. Ah Five scored at the top both with regards to the taste and the hygiene. So I came here on two consecutive days, ate the Kampong Chicken Rice both times, I liked the taste a lot, and the owners are very friendly. I went on the weekend, at around 2PM, the atmosphere was relaxed and many free seats available at this time.

Update: It has become my definite favourite Chicken Rice in Singapore.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110192298778157303377/reviews
JC,4,"The steam chicken is not bad, meat is little tough but that is expected for kampong chicken. $18 for 1/2 chicken and $1 for each rice. Can try. Ok-ok price for coffeeshop. Personally I would prefer boneless steam chicken that is softer.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105403312120201214630/reviews
