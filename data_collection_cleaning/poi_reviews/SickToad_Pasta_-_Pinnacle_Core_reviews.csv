Liying Ju,5,"Tried this pasta place cos it was available on grab and it was surprisingly good!! The aglio olio really had a kick to it, carbonara was not overly creamy. Pasta was not overcooked even though it was a delivery order. Can try if you stay around CCK area. Order came in a neat box, but oops we gobbled up everything too fast for any photos of the food!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101691308912285386116/reviews
sushi Neo,5,"The linguine prawn aglio e olio is honestly very delicious but it would be better if the pasta portion is more.. as 16$ per box for the amount of pasta is kind of less, but nonetheless its a good box of pasta",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113842517533780280527/reviews
