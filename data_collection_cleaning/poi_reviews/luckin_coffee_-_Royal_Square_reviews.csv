Joshua Ding,4,"April 2025

Finally get to try this coffee joint. No cash transaction and only pay through app. I’m not sure if this is a good business model. Pretty much eliminate many customers like myself who is a tourist and have no desire to download the app.

Sat outside since no indoor seating available. This coffee concept mostly cater to young people as I watched many customers visited this place.

Not sure will I revisit this place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103976109092529886889/reviews
see you latté,4,"Wanted a quick caffeine fix; easy ordering & payment process via mobile app. Order (1 × hot and 1 x iced) was to be ready by 1603h but, in reality, preparation took longer than expected (@1608h). Good coffee aroma, taste, and discount despite the not-so-speedy service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109562020139406369328/reviews
JAO JAO,5,"Luckin Coffee at Royal Square is a fantastic spot for a quick caffeine fix! The speed of service here is exceptional – I was impressed with how efficiently they handled my order without compromising quality. The location is incredibly convenient, especially for those in the Novena area, and the outdoor seating is a great touch. It’s perfect for enjoying a cup of coffee while taking in the surroundings.
I Highly recommended for anyone looking for a quick, yet enjoyable coffee experience in a prime location.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101237592496501407589/reviews
