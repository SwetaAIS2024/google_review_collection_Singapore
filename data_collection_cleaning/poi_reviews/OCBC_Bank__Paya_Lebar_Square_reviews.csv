Ricky Tay,1,"Thank goodness I’m closing my account and ending the relationship with this bank. Waited for man an hour to see a counter and close my account. It started with 3 counter staff but after 60 mins of wait, there is only one serving staff at the counter and another counter not in service because the staff was counting cash.

During my wait there are a few senior customers who barged in and headed straight to the counter, whilst I do understand and respect the seniors, I thought the bank could have done a better job at managing the situation! Overall I’m glad to end this relationship with the bank and having such a big space for banks, you are not maximising the space and have no care for the customer experience.

To make matters worse, I noticed 3-4 personal banking officers strolling and using the phones to text and not serving any customers (just an observation and I don’t know what exactly they do), but it forms the perception of the customer.

Such an awful experience and I hope customers don’t have the same luck as me!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109861293191650312091/reviews
Bryan Leong,1,"OCBC, please save money by eliminating the 3 front end staff managing the queue ticket. Basically not helpful and not even looking at me when I'm asking question. Just paste your magical QR code there which is basically what they do.. take out QR code for me to scan. I'm seriously confused for having this role and not having any meaningful objective. Can't do anything other than making customer angry.. hmm..",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104366033474053283224/reviews
James Yeow,1,"Was 3rd in the queue at 4:57pm and for almost one hour, the queue didn’t even move. The customer service attending a customer was just talking non related stuff to the customer. I know maintaining good customer relationships is paramount but please look at the queue and try to clear it fast than just wasting time talking unrelated bank topic.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109554261618071207352/reviews
Wen,1,Ocbc stil sends messages asking for their clients to give their i/c numbers! Please! My elderly mum thought it was a scam and had to make her way to the physical branch to clarify because the hotline could not be reach despite her call the 1800 number and waiting 30mins in vain. Pls ensure that tech does not reduce the efficiency of your service for the elderly. And it does nit compromise their safety.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116543084022829614014/reviews
Kuo Robin,2,"Was served by counter 10 for account closure and withdraw funds via cashier order. Cost is ex compared to other banks, so inquired on faster way to transfer via MEPS, however officer responded with “don’t know” what is this payment mode and made no further effort to check. Disappointed with her service.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117250781026002713975/reviews
