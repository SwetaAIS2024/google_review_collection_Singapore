Angela Hoi,5,"I love visiting 443 Coffee Shop! The food is consistently delicious, making it my regular go-to spot for coffee and meals. I frequent this place at least twice a week and have never been disappointed with the quality of the food. The new BCM stall is good as well!! However, on a couple of occasions when I was dining alone, I did encounter some uncomfortable interactions with strangers trying to strike up conversations. Despite this occasional inconvenience, I still highly recommend 443 Coffee Shop for its great food and cozy atmosphere.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900279388550722444/reviews
Han Yu Tan,4,"I got the ban mian for $4.5

It’s pretty good here. The broth is really meaty, nicely seasoned and not too salty. The portion is quite big too, and it comes hot. I only didn’t really like the noodles as it was initially a bit tough, but after soaking in the noodle for some time, it becomes more chewy. Personally i prefer thinner noodles, but that’s my preference.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110231907823839530082/reviews
