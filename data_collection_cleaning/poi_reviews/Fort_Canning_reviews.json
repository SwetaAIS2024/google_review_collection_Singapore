Can even sleep on the floor there since its so clean. Toilets are the best among all the other lines. Big and clean. Pre or during or post covid, cleanliness still no 1. Kudos to all the staff there especially cleaning staff. Hope all train lines in Singapore follow this exemplary example.",

Toilets are clean, stations are well maintained, like all other Downtown Line stations. This isn't much different. This though, doesn't have retail outlets unlike some other bigger stations. One bummer is how it takes a long roundabout to get to Newton interchange, and it becomes a natural dilemmas whether to switch at Little India (next stop) and walk, or to sit through the 16 minutes.",
