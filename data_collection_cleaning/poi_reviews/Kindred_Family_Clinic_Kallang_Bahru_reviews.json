      "text": "Really appreciate Dr Adibâ€™s professionalism, patience and passion! So impressed with his care that I had to come leave a review.\n\nNot only is he a GP, you can also consult him for his sports science know-how. Went to him for an injury and he didnâ€™t just diagnose my pain, he gave me recovery exercises and even training exercises for longer term fitness goals, and even provided advice on other care options when he didnâ€™t need to.\n\nHe explained my vaccination and gave me understanding of the shot I was getting. Perhaps itâ€™s not a style for everyone to be given more information than needed but I appreciate that he can read his patients well and makes asking questions and taking charge of your own health much easier and more comfortable.\n\nIf I move away I will definitely come back to see him. If you ever fall sick, I hope itâ€™s when heâ€™s in! ðŸ¤£\n\nsuper love the day time receptionist also, sheâ€™s so nice",
