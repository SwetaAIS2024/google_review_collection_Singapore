Mr Syaf,4,"Friendly staff, great service for families with kids, and a very convenient location on Orchard Street. As a Muslim, I found plenty of halal restaurants below and across this building. Easy for take away food too for families with toddlers and would rather eat in the apartment.

Somerset Orchard also has a kids playroom, a playground on the rooftop and a baby sitting service. The apartment we stayed in was clean and convenient for us with three kids aged 4, 2 and 1.

We had a great stay.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106245701682189275484/reviews
Jade Web Design,5,"We had a 2 bedroom apartment which had everything we could ever need to make this accommodation our home away from home.  We appreciate the washing machine/dryer, the cute, comfortable babycot; the lovely bathroom amenities and other details like a torchlight in the bedside drawer. The playroom was very good for little children.  The breakfast is simple but good, with 4 cooked selections, bread, pastries, cereals and fresh fruits.  We love the coffee machine with espresso, latte, mocha, etc,  and even teh tarik at the push of a button.  The staff are professional, friendly and efficient.  Our local phone calls charges were waived for being online members.  The location is fantastic, close to all eating and shopping places and malls as well as MRT stations.  We will be back to stay here when we're next in Singapore.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106157159760125691002/reviews
Mere Yabaki,5,"We have returned home to Fiji from a lovely family (5) holiday in Singapore. Our stay at this place Somerset Apartments was wonderful. Cosy and comfortable bedrooms, handy washer/dryer, small fridge and microwave for quick eats and the front desk services was prompt, friendly and most helpful at all times. We found the speedy wifi use very helpful for allowing us to see Singapore in a week very well. The children were very well cared for with healthy and well catered breakfast and a pool to use too. Location wise, we could not be better placed in Singapore city, public buses and MRT nearby. Shopping malls and eateries plentiful. Worth a second trip, or third trip too :)",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110365531914475835875/reviews
The Architect Draws,4,"Three great things:
1. Rooms are very spacious!
2. Great location as it is near to the Somerset MRT and bus stations.
3. Appreciate that the room came with a mobile to make local unlimited calls and use to connect to the internet when going around.

What can be improved: It is actually an old building and could use a makeover, especially since it is located in a very touristy area. If you're room is facing Orchard Road, the huge screen from Orchard Central and the birds are very bothersome.

Dwi Hermanto,2,"The hotel is ok. Unfortunately the handy facility could not be used as wifi Hotspot. It is quite disappointing as most of guests are foreigners and need Internet connected to their mobile. If the handy could not be a hotspot wifi, it is almost no point to have the facility add it is not ""handy"" anymore. Nowadays Internet is not expensive anyway, rather than guests have to find Sim card in the city that are not familiar with.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104689672152220763621/reviews
