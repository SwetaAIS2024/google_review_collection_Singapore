Both different but really nice showcase of Asian talent! In Wonders of Nature there is more interactivity (bringing art to life with googles and actual play area) and definitely was worth the visit. Recommended!",

      "text": "The exhibition I went to has two parts. First  one (curated by the Whitestone Gallery) talked about the create ideology and philosophy of a post-war Japanese avant-garde artist Yasuo Sumi. He became internationally famous for expressing the ‘messy and frantic’ state-of-mind with bold methods and tools (e.g. abacus).\n\nThe second (curated by the New Art Museum Singapore) introduces and showcases - primarily but not exclusively - stories and artpieces from the Japanese post-war Gutai movement which believes in expression freedom using exploratory techniques and physical means (e.g. using projectiles).\n\nBoth are well curated with plenty of artworks in display. I had a fun Sunday afternoon tour browsing through them.\n\nLastly the staff - especially the manager of the exhibitions - were very very knowledgeable and approachable. They make arts approachable and enjoyable for everyone.\n\nI would recommend even for a casual wonder around and see some interesting creativities at display.",
