Ywy C,5,"I have enrolled my child into a couple of chinese tuition centres before but they were all mediocre. It was until I sent my child to Xuelin did her Chinese results show significant improvements.
Her teacher has always kept track of her progress and consistently phoned and informed me about it.

Good and effective chinese tuition if you want your child to score well.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117638407396571113339/reviews
LJ SS-,5,"It only took one lesson for my kids and I to see the difference between Xuelin and other Chinese tuition centres. Their teachers are extra caring and supportive, even though my kids are on the slower side. The best place to send your kids to!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118298580845214912734/reviews
Helen Wu,5,"Very devoted teachers and principal. Highly recommend!

I enrolled my son into their hanyu pinyin and reading holiday classes back in June. Ever since, I noticed a huge shift in his interest in chinese! Every night, he would automatically take out his own books and get me to listen to his reading. He is no longer fearful of reading chinese. I am extremely thankful towards the teachers as his confidence in chinese has made him excited to start his primary school journey this year and gave him the right foundation.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106162478842648413019/reviews
