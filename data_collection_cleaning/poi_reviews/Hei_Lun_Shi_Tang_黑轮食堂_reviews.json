      "text": "Tried the meatball soup and braised pork rice combo. Rice was decent, though not spectacular. Soup, on the other hand, was memorable. Very tasty, which also meant the radish was infused with flavour. Meatballs were substantial, had a good bite and incorporated mushrooms for additional flavour and texture.\n\nMenu is rather extensive - would return to try their other dishes",
