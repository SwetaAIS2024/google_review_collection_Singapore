WM Kwok,5,"My family had a really enjoyable stay for 2 weeks at Aranda Country Club. The team at ACC also made our stay so comfortable, constantly checking in on us.

Huge space, fresh air and easy access to amenities such as restaurants and shops.

Highly recommended for your next getaway with the family.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100710183678927715820/reviews
Sheanne Polca,5,"Booked two side by side unit in this place for 18th birthday of my daughter. The living room is too big, we are able to put the backdrop to do the party in first unit and catering in second unit. Each unit has 2 bedrooms, 2 toilets, kitchen and balcony.
For weekend they required 2 consecutive nights. We stayed there for 2 nights last weekend. Cooking is not allowed but can use the bbq pit. And there’s a nearby mall in the area. Can use the swimming pool as well.
I think it’s very affordable and big place to rent for all occasions. And for all ntuc members, they got a discount as well.
And to get side by side unit need to book 4 months earlier.
Overall, our stay and birthday celebration is really awesome.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100804128492013088400/reviews
Xin Yu,4,"Spacious room and convenient location! Room is clean and equipped with Smart TV, microwave and big fridge which is essential to host gatherings. Minus 1 star because of the lack in amenities (eg. no dishwashing soap, hair dryer or plates/bowls) so you have to come prepared. Can also be noisy in the day if your room is right next to wild wild wet.  Also didn’t use the bbq pits cause was raining non-stop, but it doesn’t look very well maintained. Nevertheless, would be back next time!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114570369072776567502/reviews
