      "text": "Absolutely amazing experience at this cafÃ©! The waffles were perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, paired beautifully with their unique, flavorful ice creams. The Latte and Americano were smooth, fragrant, and well brewed.\n\nTheir freshly baked sponge cakes were incredibly soft and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The variety of flavorsâ€”Gula Melaka, Lime, Lemon, Green Tea, and Black Sesameâ€”made it hard to choose a favorite, but the Black Sesame and Lime won me over. My husband especially loved the Gula Melaka sponge cake, which had a rich burst of coconut milk flavor.\n\nThe cafÃ©â€™s ambience is warm and inviting, making it a perfect spot to relax, catch up with friends, or enjoy quality time with loved ones. Plus, the location is super convenientâ€”just a short walk from Mayflower MRT.\n\nA big thank you to the lady boss for her warm hospitality and friendly service. Highly recommended!",
