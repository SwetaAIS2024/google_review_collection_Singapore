Ezann Lee,5,"Tried this soup store for the first time after my boyfriend‚Äôs mom recommended it, and I loved it!

Ordered $6 Fried Fish & $7 Slice Fish Soup üêü

The aunty was super friendly and welcoming, great hospitality. I went for the $7 one for more fish and they were really generous with the portions. Soup broth was delicious, very flavorful but rice serving could be a little more!

Service was also really fast, and I noticed many old returning customers, which says a lot. Definitely coming back again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110053723566779069920/reviews

Richard Sng,4,"Paid $5.00 for fish mee sua. The fishes are very fresh. The portion is also very generous with quite some slices of fishes. Together with the mee sua, this is a satisfying meal. The broth is flavourful as well. Worth a try.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104370439475671977562/reviews
Dhivya Ramathas,5,"I was in the area and decided to try the food due to the high rating. I ordered the sliced fish soup with mee sua ($7).

The soup was hearty and packed with umami, the mee sua remained unsoggy even after the trip back home, and the sliced fish was fresh, generous and chunky while remaining silky smooth.

Aunty was warm and friendly! ‚ù§Ô∏è Good homecooked food vibes and quality, I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116953055917881825881/reviews
Jacob TAN,4,This is the only fish soup stall that sells oyster omelette. Bought the oyster omelette back to try. This oyster omelette is without the gooey flour in the dish. It is simply fried egg omelette with the oysters covered inside. The omelette egg is properly fried and taste homecooked. The oysters are fresh and nice. Will try the fish soup the next time when I'm there.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
