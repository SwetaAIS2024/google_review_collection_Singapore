      "text": "One of the best Christian school for pre-nursery to kindergarten with a strong focus on the word and foundational teachings. Teachers are very dedicated. Facilities are good and built with many safety aspects for children. Price is also very reasonable and affordable. This little known gem is a very rare find. For example, Christmas is taught to the children based on biblical doctrine and not around Santa Claus and partying.",

      "text": "Went to this school for kindergarten, as well as for a 2 night camp when I was 8. We had a barbeque outside and I left my water bottle in one of the rooms inside the school/church. It was dark inside because everyone was outside and the lights inside were turned off, so I asked one of the teachers (whom I knew from when I was in kindergarten) to accompany me to get my bottle. She told me to get it myself and I said I didn't want to because I was scared and it was creepy inside (I was 8). She said coldly 'how dare you call god's house creepy?' and made me enter the dark school all alone and scared. Turned me away from god and religion growing up, and made me distrust teachers in general.",
