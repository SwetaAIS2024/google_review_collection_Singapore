Magdalene Lee,5,"Good homecooked curry chicken noodles, comes with a very generous portion of tender white chicken, taupok, and even pork skin. Lady boss was very friendly and served with a generous portion of coriander. Only remembered to take a photo halfway through the meal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112381004750725439225/reviews
Amos Chan,5,"I find this very interesting. In the afternoon this is not the hot pot shop, but a curry chicken noodle shop instead. Two ladies men the shop in the afternoon, during lunch. The curry chicken noodle I had was great. Baby was not too thick but fragrant. Paired with smooth steamed chicken. Selling at 5, 6 and $7. Price slightly higher, and has a good portion that matches the price. Will return for more",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100694782845422484182/reviews
Zarah Jane,5,"The place was a bit humid. Guess that‚Äôs just our tropical weather. Would have been great if we had the hot pot under an air-conditioned setting but the price of the hot pot made up for everything! At less than $20, it‚Äôs really value for money. We helped ourselves to the peanut sauce, which at certain joints is chargeable (ikr? Go figure) There was abundance of vegetable and they have this ‚ÄúSunny Side Up‚Äù fried egg offer which went well with the rice and soup. A must recommend for this quaint, little hawker centre. Do come before they decide to do Urban Renewal to this nice hideaway! üç≥",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109293405074405859317/reviews
