Jaslyn Koh,4,"Hi there,

I am Jaslyn, I am  a resident who
is staying at the East side. I would like to request econ to add more vegetarian instant noodles on deliveroo. Hence  I always orders vegetarian noodles , drinks and breads from econ store that is  located at the east side using deliveroo app. I realized there is only 1 vegetarian noodles. So hope to see more vegetarian noodles and vegan foods on sale. Thank you.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112550104410600048077/reviews
