Khuan Yew Cheah,5,"Delicious pork sausage banh mi. Taste is great and good size. Prices start from $6. Try the salted coffee with foam for $5. Make it a set for $10.

Friendly owner and good service. Place is small for eating in but there are small tables on the walkway outside.

Value for money for an authentic meal!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104299662595606999855/reviews
TitusYo_ _,5,"Was amazed to find this hidden gem!! Owners were really friendly and efficient!

I was amazed to find authentic banh mi, and went for the traditional banh mi, which had a rich blend of pate and vietnamese butter that complemented each other well!!

The vietnamese milk coffee was wonderfully authentic, and had the same thick, powerful aroma like those in Vietnam!!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115825026406674734704/reviews
Julia Low,4,"This Banh Mi transports me back to the streets of Ho Chi Minh City.

The baguette is delicious, with its perfectly crispy, crusty exterior and a slightly chewy interior that complements the filling.

The banh mi is stuffed generously - features a delightful mix of cold-cut meats, including pate, luncheon meat, and slices ranging from pink to white, all enhanced by generous amounts of savory floss.

The freshness of the pickled vegetables, cucumber, onions, and coriander adds a vibrant crunch and a burst of flavor, which balances the cold cuts.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116360636909081420398/reviews
