Henry,5,A good place to chill out after work or during weekend. Seems that it should be more crowded during weekdays as it is surrounded with high rise with offices. Bring here during weekend and it is less crowded.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105859231212522684498/reviews
Constantin Zhukov,4,"A convenient station in the city centre, linked to a massive underground mall that connects to other stations in the network (mainly City Hall).

If you're alighting here to get to the Esplanade Theatre, please note that the walking distance is quite long. I personally prefer alighting at City Hall instead if I'm travelling to the Esplanade on MRT. City Hall is still quite a distance away, but there's more stuff to see and it's slightly closer.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108989207217759345404/reviews
Chye Eng Ng,5,"A performing arts centre with an unique design that has performance over the weekends both in the centre and at the theatre near the bay.

There are theatre, theatre studio, recital studio and concert halls that host various concerts and musicals throughout the year.

There is also a Library@Esplanade where you can find books relating to arts and culture.

Do go up to the ""sky terrace"" to have a good view of Singapore skyline.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100423115188445938563/reviews
Ma S,4,"This is one of my favourite station as itâ€™s connected to shopping mall named Marina Square and there is a link-way to theatre and City Hall & Raffles Place:)

This area is kids-friendly so you can find many playgrounds!;)
During lunch time on weekday and afternoon on weekend, itâ€™s very crowded but morning on weekend, itâ€™s still quiet and comfortable;)",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101736631242777756594/reviews
