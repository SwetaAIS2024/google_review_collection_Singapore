      "text": "Had lunch at the restaurant after peak hour yet service was very slow.  Food wise, the mango salad and seafood tomyam soup were good. The rest were rather disappointing. Personally I felt that the chilli sauces used to cook the fried fish (which was their promotion item for new member) and lady fingers do not blend well.  It has a weird after taste especially the sauce for the fish.  Luckily the sauces was served separately, thus we could still enjoy the crispy fried fish.  The prawns tanghoon was extremely oily, we could not finished the vermicelli as it was full of oil at the bottom of the bowl.\nWe tried their desserts chendol and tapioca, not really fantastic. If you are not fussy with the chendol ingredient's texture and the coconut milk, then you may find them acceptable.\nThe ambience is okay.  Good location to slowly enjoy the meal.\nPerhaps next time we could try out other dishes which were given positive feedback!",

We almost finished our food before the main dish came out. The ice lemon tea was bitter and when we tried to ask for sugar, it took the waitress more than 5 minutes to serve it.",
