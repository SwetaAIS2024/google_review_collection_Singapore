Yap Hoe BENG,4,"Nov24, sometime going to a hawker is quite disappointing with 90% stall closes for lunch. Coming to this coffee shop is surely able to have your favourites we try the roasted stall 7/- for mixed of 3 different meats. Very good. Worth to try. The tea is good, place is airy.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116220693681278781294/reviews
L Chan,5,"Economic Rice stall.
Rice + sweet & sour pork + bitter gourd scrambled eggs = $2.80
Kopi C = $1.50",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116520472038541999281/reviews
Soo Hin Yeoh,4,"Not great but better food quality stalls than Telok Blangah Crescent Food Court next door, also brighter and airier than the dark hawker center next door.

The 12 Mixed Rice stall offers quite a high quality range of options, my sweet & sour chicken and tofu mix was priced at $4.00 but still affordable,  so a tad higher than hawker centers.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115725392210756907778/reviews
Kel Ho,2,"Latest update: stall attendent refused my cdc vouchers in sheng xin fish hotpot zichar stall. Saying they don't accept cdc. I have done it before a few months back. Is a disappointment. I suggest not to come back for big meals.

Hot beverage like kopi o which I ordered 2nd time these months.. The kopi o served was a lesser than usual. Since it happened twice from the same coffee lady. This no coincidence. Decided not to confront them. I rather avoid this coffee lady instead.

Foods is alright. 名轩 roasted meats is nice but standards not the same for everyday. 成吉 Hainan chicken rice maintained it's standards for tender chickens and same fragrant rice. Nice or not is subjective. Is enough for my palate.
Sisaket thai food serves legit Thai food. Recognized by my thai friend and favoursome. Portion might be a little small in my opinion like fried kailan. But compare to zi char fried vegetables? Sisaket serves good portio.n for $5.
Dim sum forget it. Duck rice stall standards dropped since the day it opens a few months ago. Duck meat was tough on certain days. Zi char tall was featured by some youtuber for their Assam fish head $9.90 after spending certain amount. The food was just average. Mixed vege rice is average. I had toilet runs occasionally after their meals.
Atmosphere indeed choking due to mala stall cooks if you sit indoor. Sit outdoor full of smokers. Avoid meal hours should be fine.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101230092212946091875/reviews
Jeffrey Jiang,5,"Inside this coffee shop is a nice gem of a Thai food store. They have rather authentic Thai dishes similar to what you can find in Bangkok. A meal for two as shown in the picture would set you back at $17. Beware the spice level is rather substantial, only thing missing is a glass of Thai ice tea.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102464939151659001764/reviews
