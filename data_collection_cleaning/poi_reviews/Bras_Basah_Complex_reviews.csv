Buren,4,"It's slightly different now, but it used to be heaven because I love books. There were stores and stores full of books and I could spend hours roaming through them. Now, when everything changes to digital and the interest of book has unfortunately dwindled down,  and some of my favorite shops are gone, I don't visit this place as often.

At least, it has Art and Friends here, which is probably one of the last interest. There is still a bookstore, but the charm of weird and wonderful collections of books is not as what it used to be.

It is still charming though, a older style of shopping complex with its unique shop compared to modern malls that populate the rest of Singapore.

Come here by City Hall or Brass Basah MRT. There is motorcycle and car parking as well.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103975090698079167241/reviews

As a book lover and art enthusiast, I was blown away by the eclectic mix of stores here. From cozy second-hand bookshops filled with rare finds to specialty stores stocking art supplies, stationery, and unique crafts, this place is a paradise for creatives and bibliophiles alike.

The vibe here is nostalgic and vibrant—imagine rows of stores bursting with colorful art materials, shelves stacked with books in every language, and friendly vendors happy to share recommendations. I stumbled upon a quaint café on the upper floor, perfect for a coffee break between exploring.

What makes this complex special is its cultural charm. It’s not just a mall; it’s a community hub where art, literature, and history come alive. Plus, its central location near the Singapore Art Museum and National Museum makes it a must-add to any itinerary.

Justice Okai-Allotey,4,This was a complex I visited for an event during my time in Singapore. It was a walking distance from my hotel. Was easily accessible and had visible markings and very disability friendly. I found the complex I was visiting easily when I asked the security around.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117426043620417923402/reviews
