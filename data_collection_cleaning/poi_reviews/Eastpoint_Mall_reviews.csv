Richmond Chia,5,"Just visited again Eastpoint Mall today with my wife. It has a big NTUC on level 5 and food court on level 4. There are very nice food at this food court. Should check it out if nearby. Lots of other shops here too like Japan Home, Value Shop, Courts and other F&B. You can easily get your necessities here including household and electrical stuffs. And itâ€™s right beside Simei MRT Station make the mall location more ideal than others.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102765716153717605604/reviews
Mohammad Roslan Bin Slamat,5,"KUDOS TO SIMEIANS

I went to Eastpoint Mall to buy some necessities. In my hurriedness, I thought I placed my wallet into my sling bag but I missed and dropped the wallet. I went back home without realizing it.

Only when I checked that I discovered the loss. I immediately made my way back to Eastpoint. While walking and on the line with one of my banks to freeze my card, I received a call from Eastpoint. The person on the other side was Guna, a Security officer of the mall. He assured me right away that my wallet was found and already handed over to them.

I met Mr. Guna who handed over my items to me after doing the necessary documentation.

I am indebted to the kind person (whom I wish will be showered with blessings and wellness) who found my wallet and immediately handed it over to the security team, and to Mr. Guna who immediately found my business card and called me. He had saved me much time and inconvenience with the banks and other authorities.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118407456789675707923/reviews
Joyce Chin,1,"The ladies' toilet on the ground floor is consistently in a poor state, with visible dirt, stains, and unpleasant odors present almost daily. The persistent lack of cleanliness falls short of basic toilet hygiene standards, making it a recurring issue for users.
Unlike other malls under Frasers, the toilets at Eastpoint are particularly pathetic, highlighting a notable disparity in maintenance and upkeep.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101674530256898315724/reviews
Furniture123,1,"Be cautious of their expired inventory at the supermarket in this mall. They sell expired or spoiled products to unsuspecting buyers. If you discover a spoiled item, they audaciously demand proof-implying the customer is responsible for the spoilage-before agreeing to an exchange. Essentially, they rely on customers to inspect product quality and monitor expiration dates themselves.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109152495520375433004/reviews
