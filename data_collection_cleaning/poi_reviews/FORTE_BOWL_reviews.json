Lane often had maintenance issues(pit dark out/stuck) and when we asked to change, which the staff kindly did, the lane took exceptionally long to reset the pins(30s each time). We paid a total $73.9 for 5 pax which included socks and shoe rental. Overall clean and friendly staff albeit the not so pleasant experience.",

The older female colleague was definitely much friendlier and helpful, which we really appreciate as we have young kids bowling for the first time.\nFor people who are visiting for the first time, when the staff asks how many games? If you have 4pax, it‚Äôs a min. of 4 games. This mean each pax will play for 1 round. If you want to play 2 rounds each then it‚Äôs a total of 8.\n\nOther than that, the facilities were good, staff was quick to assist us when the ball was stuck in the middle of the lane. We appreciate that a lot üôèüèª\nThank you for making it a great experience for the young kids.",
