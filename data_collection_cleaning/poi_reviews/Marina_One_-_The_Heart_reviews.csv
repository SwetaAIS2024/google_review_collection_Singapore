Kai Ling,5,Tranquil green space in the heart of CBD. Place can get really crowded during lunch hour. Understandably so as it has plenty of dining options to offer. Really enjoy strolling in the park area during quieter hours. A nice respite from hectic office vibes.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100635259993109346258/reviews
Jennifer Liepin,2,"Dead as a doorknob on a Sunday afternoon. At least half the eateries were closed, although I‚Äôm glad that there is a Cold Storage, to eat prepared food, and public dining space to then eat this at",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107459204527494230825/reviews
Quinn'z Land,4,"This, this was where Google Maps showed its incompetence. We went around for like a whole hour not being able to locate where this place was even though we‚Äôre standing exactly at the point that Maps told us we arrived. Really a frustrating and disappointing experience that also let down everything after that for us. It‚Äôs basically a residential building so nothing much to see. A couple of trees and displays at best. A little crowded since this place is now popular with tourists so you might have to wait for your turn to take photos.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101102205990100579189/reviews

JH,4,"the heart. what is the heart? some may say that it is ‚Äúa hollow muscular organ that pumps the blood through the circulatory system by rhythmic contraction and dilation. In vertebrates there may be up to four chambers (as in humans), with two atria and two ventricles.‚Äù. others may say that it is ‚Äúthe central or innermost part of something.‚Äú. but i found my true definition of the heart. that is this place. this place is truly magical. a quiet and peaceful spot tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city. the only bad thing about the place is that i could not reach the water tubes tho. a solid 9/10 üòçü§§üò´",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110211267544992129823/reviews
