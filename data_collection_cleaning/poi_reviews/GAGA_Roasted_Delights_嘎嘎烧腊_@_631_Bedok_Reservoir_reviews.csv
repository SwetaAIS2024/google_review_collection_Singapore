Yeo SiewChoo,1,"the staff is very rude. brought $20+ of chicken rice n roast meat plus soup, only give 2 pkt of chilli ( very little inside). as there's a pile of pkt chilli just in front of me, I take another 2 more, the skinny guy reached out his hand almost slapped mine. saying U must asked, not wanting it anymore I put them back.

Zon,5,"Newly opened. There was a queue of about 10 people when I bought this.

Very generous portions of roasted duck and chicken. And it cost only $5.50! Very worth it üëç",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102533773384381773636/reviews

Jin Tee Neo,1,"Rude and mannerless staff, when my father in his 70s is ordering halfway and another person cut the queue to order.

The staff ignored my father, whom he was taking the order from, and took the order from the guy who cut the queue. My father had to re-order.

Disrespectful staff, GAGA, if this is how you train your staff, then I'm speechless.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110428765195704596952/reviews
George Chan,1,"Terrible roast meat joint. Rude staff ""threw"" the soup bowl onto the tray and spilt soup all over. Ordered a roast duck rice and it was more of a roasted bone rice. Essentially paid for a plate of rice and bones. If you value your customers, you could have chosen cuts from different part of the duck and mixed the bones in - instead of giving the customer a completely bony experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102029470478158261442/reviews
