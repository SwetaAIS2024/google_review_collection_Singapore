There’s both indoor and alfresco seating, a good range of food, and plenty of room for kids to run around (bring a ball or scooter!).\n\nFood was tasty, and the staff were prompt in service. All in, a lovely weekend hangout.",

Not too crowded on a weekend which is great. There is room for improvement on the food but otherwise still a decent cafe to hang out. Indoor and outdoor dining options are available and if the weather isn’t too warm, the big bench outside is a great place to be for a big group.",

Each reservation is 2hrs only.\n\nFood is not bad. Brekky burger $22++ is nice. With 2pcs hashbrowns. Yummy.\n\nTruffles fries are nice too. $11++\n\nKids food items also not bad. With yakult and mini popsicle (apple juice).\n\nStaff tend to forget the items ordered so make sure your items all served before you go counter pay.\n\nBFT members have 15% discount. Not bad~",
