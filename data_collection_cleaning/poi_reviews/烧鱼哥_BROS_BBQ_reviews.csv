Bryan Lon,4,"I ordered their 3+1 frog together with a medium porridge, and also a sambal stingray. Their food tastes great. Both the frogs and the Stingray are delicious and I highly recommend both dishes, a solid 8.5/10. We also ordered some of their vegetable dishes and it also tasted very flavourful. This place probably has the best frogs among the other frog places I've tried in Toa Payoh. Their prices are also quite reasonable.

The only thing that disappointed me was the portion size for the frogs. As you can see from my photos, it looks less than 4 frogs and my friends and I were commenting about the portion size. We thought they had forgotten a frog or used smaller sized frogs instead. The sambal stingray is great and the portion is acceptable for the price.

Overall I had a good dining experience here. Their dishes are very tasty and flavourful. I will definitely visit again, but this time I'll have to order more frogs.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101869506055887544256/reviews
Ed Is Here,2,Taste not bad. But the ingredients so niao. Onions much much more than meat and petai and that cost 9 dollars. Abit not worth for money.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116458940252063311103/reviews
YongSheng Teh,1,Rubbish place. Ordered a $10 bbq sotong. Got a sambal sotong instead. Nevermind. It only has 10 piece or so. The ratio of onions to sotong is at least 2.5:1. Dun even bother eating at this stall where each piece of sotong cost $1.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103793032914031003143/reviews
