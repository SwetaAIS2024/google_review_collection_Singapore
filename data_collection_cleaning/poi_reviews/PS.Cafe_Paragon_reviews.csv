Beary Beary,4,"Beautiful Decor and Atmosphere

Had lunch here with some friends on a weekday. Although it was not crowded in the beginning, it became pretty full halfway thru lunch.

Which was why the service was a bit hurried and sometimes food was served without the right cutlery. However, they were responsive when attention was needed.

The food was pretty decent. Quantity was generous and plating was good.

What stood out in this place was the 6 star decor. It was not over lavish, just pretty inviting. Somehow it felt really nice to be in the restaurant. Kudos to whoever designed the place.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101788329090998743221/reviews
