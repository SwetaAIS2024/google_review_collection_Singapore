It's not that good during high peak hours.\n\nI recommend the grilled fish too, it's enough for 4 person if you're having it with rice.\n\n-----\n\nI always order the masala thosai or indian rojak at the indian muslim stall.\n\n-----\n\nAh yes, char siew rice, wanton mee and curry chicken noodle can be a good option.\n\n-----\n\nTaiwan stall a little disappointing and overpriced.\nEnoki mushrooms has this woody smell, plus it was very oily, so it was just oozing with this woody + oil with every bite.\n\nThe salted chicken, just boiled chicken apparently with veggies of your choice. Tastes alright but nothing amazing. It's more expensive than having mala xiang guo though, probably because this has more meat.\n\nAll in all. I've had better Taiwanese food in SG but just not this place. I cook better lu rou fan too... so...\n\n-----\n\nWestern food will be good for those who like thickly battered and breaded items, which you can hardly taste item inside. Sorry, this is not for me.",

I particularly tasted and like these 2 stalls: the Mee Goreng is very consistently good taste.\n\nThis Chinese Malaysia stall took over the precious Thai Food stall.  I tried the 刀削面 and liked it.  The broth is not oily and salty, the taste is delicious for $5 Beef noodles!",

      "text": "Decent food options here with average edible food but hard to stomach food prices. Decent amount of seats but seats indoors can get really hot and stuffy.\n\nFor some reason the coffeeshops at punggol have predatory crazy prices for both food and drinks. The drink stall here has raised prices to obscene levels, and this ice teh c is already $2.30. They don't even bother to give a full cup despite already being 75% ice. Do yourself a favor and get a cheaper drink elsewhere or from the supermarket next door.\n\nFood options as of writing includes hokkien mee, Mala xiangguo,  mince pork noodles and fish soup, chicken rice, economy mix rice and the char stall. I'd recommend the hokkien mee (despite its price) - its the local MP's go to meal as well when she's in the area for visits.",
