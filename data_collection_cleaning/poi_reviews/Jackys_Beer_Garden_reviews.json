It's quite insane how a cup of sugar cane is almost the same as a bowl of noodles. The kind of skills that go behind a bowl of noodles, vs the kind of effort taken to getting a cup of okay sugar cane, is just unjustifiable in my personal opinion.\n\nLarge cup of sugar cane ended up being $3.50 and I was like. Wow what a rip off!\n\nThe owners also feel quite stuck up in their little island, away from the main stretch of hawker stalls. Helps if they smiled a little more instead of portraying the \"you got no one else to buy from\" attitude.",

Apart from that, everything here is overpriced (even for the location) and the service is extremely poor with the uncle often snapping impatiently at the customers. It seems that the attitude that they portray is that the customers need them more than they need the customers.",
