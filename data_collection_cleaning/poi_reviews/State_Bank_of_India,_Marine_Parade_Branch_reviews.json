      "text": "I just visited this Marine Parade branch in Feb 2024. The new staff Xavier is very friendly and sincere. I would rate his service to 5*. My FD has expired for a few days, so I wanted to track my previous interest details. Unexpectedly, his manager was impatient and sounded a bit reproachful as to why I came after the maturity date. This made it difficult for them to track. Isnâ€˜t this an internal bank system problem? Why blame the customers? As a superior, shouldn't she set a good example to train the new staff professionally when dealing with customers? Hence I can only rate 3* for the overall experience.",
