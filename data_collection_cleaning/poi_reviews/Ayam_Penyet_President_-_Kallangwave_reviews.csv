Joanna Ang,4,The tauhu telor is a must order. Crispy outside n soft tauhu inside. Quite a good size m can be a meal by itself. The sauce is nice too. Suggestion to put chillies at the side for this dish. The ox soup is flavourful n the meat is quite well cooked too. Very nice üëç,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107607506035375970544/reviews

Vu Nguyen,4,"Good food. Self serve soup. Good variety of options to choose from. Fairly good portion side. The grill beef feels quite dry for me but the rest was good. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è good serve fairly quickly.
Have good seatings for group. Maybe just me but it‚Äôs was a bit warm inside the restaurant. Not a bad feed but I expected better? Reasonable price for the location.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111663395004252024642/reviews
Christina Tan,1,"I‚Äôm very disappointed in the expectations of the food I bought for takeaway. All the pictures shown on the menu were the full thigh parts. But when I got home and opened the pack, I was surprised it was the driest breast (upper part) of the chicken I‚Äôve ever come across. Very very deceiving and should have at least informed customers that the parts are not available or whatsoever. The Tahu was also way too salty too.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104081731896580991686/reviews
