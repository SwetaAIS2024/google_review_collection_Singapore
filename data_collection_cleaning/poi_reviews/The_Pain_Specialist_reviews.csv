Soon jong Lau,1,"I had a very disappointing experience with Dr. Yeo. He is an extremely unprofessional doctor with poor time management skills. During my consultations, I felt rushed, and he didn’t seem to take the time to listen to my concerns. On top of that, he would raise his voice, making me feel like I owed him something rather than the other way around. His attitude was dismissive, and it was clear he wasn’t interested in providing quality care. However, I will say that his clinic staff is attentive and patient, especially towards my mother, which was a bright spot. Unfortunately, this does not make up for the poor experience with Dr. Yeo. I would not recommend him to anyone looking for a doctor who is patient, attentive, and respectful.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112076064860215034018/reviews
Tracy,5,"For the past 6 months, I have been seeing Doctor Yeo for my upper back pain and sensitive nerve issues. Every consultation is very comforting and assuring. He's quite humorous and talks to you like a friend but can also be strict when needed (for your own good). I have undergone 2 injection procedures with him and recovered well each time.  Also, ALL the staffs/nurses in the clinic are a gem to have. They are super friendly and very helpful. Prompt in replies too. They are like friends to me and offer comfort when needed. Highly recommend this clinic!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117388324234400925878/reviews
Lauren C,1,"I had a bad experience with Dr. Yeo, and am thankful I got a second opinion. Negatives: he belittled me and said my pain was psychological; he insisted that my husband come to every appointment; almost every appointment was rescheduled the same day of the appointment; was unhelpful with insurance; he acted as if the pain was my problem; he put me on strong pain medication at a high dose, but did not recommend any treatment for the pain; the procedures were double the price of another doctor; spent more time/money, with poor results.

Positives: his office staff was kind

AVOID Dr. Yeo if you want a kind, empathetic doctor for your pain!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109965667129235489514/reviews
Eva Tunisia,5,"Dr Yeo has been my personal pain management doctor since 2015. He is an extraordinary pain specialist who would go miles to help you. He believed in me and the undescribable fibromyalgia and chronic regional pain syndrome nerve pain that I go though and that is the most important thing to me. Having known me inside out, he spotted me looking so pale during one my scheduled visits in Dec 2019. At that time I was merely 1 week away to fly to Korea. Dr Yeo quickly activated one of the best gynae he knew to help me with my issue and together with her, he solved my serious nerve and serious bleeding issue in a matter of days so that I could continue with my trip. That was the most memorable moment I will never forget. My nerve issue is very complicated but he tirelessly still will step forward to help me and console me along the way. I could never find another more understanding doctor as good as him. During my recent admission, he even delayed his flight to ensure I am properly well taken care of and discharged with 0 pain. Thank you soooo much Dr Yeo and to the great team of nurses too who are contactable 24/7! Kudos to The Pain Specialist Singapore!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112421963562949425806/reviews
Jastine Koh,5,"I was recommended by a friend to see Dr Yeo in early 2021 for my persistent tinnitus condition. Before that, I went to see few ENT specialists but all of them mentioned that there was no cure and that I have to ‘live’ with it. I was so depressed as the constant ringing sound is causing me to have headaches day in day out so much so that it affected my daily life. I had difficulty focusing on my work and had serious sleep disturbance.
Seeing my agony, my friend Amanda recommended me to Dr Yeo to seek alternative treatment. Dr Yeo was very patient and show lots of empathy for my condition. Initially he prescribed me a medication to curb the ringing sound. It was effective and the sound became more faint after two months or so. As medication is not the long term solution he suggested to do acupuncture for a few sessions and it proved very effective. After 10 sessions, my tinnitus and persistent headaches gradually disappeared! I was able to resume my normal lifestyle at his professional advise.
As im writing this review, I have recovered 90 percent and I do not have to depend on any medication as well. I could not be more grateful to Dr Yeo! Apart from tinnitus, he also provide other medical advice and offered to customize medical check up suited to my needs.
Overall, it was a total pleasant experience seeking professional medical attention from Dr Yeo as he treats his patients like friends and has no airs at all.  I will not hesitate to recommend his service to anyone who experience persistent pain as im confident he will be able to provide most effective solution and appropriate treatment.
Thank you Dr Yeo!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108611288498696114535/reviews
