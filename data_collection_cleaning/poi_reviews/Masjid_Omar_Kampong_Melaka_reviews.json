There seems to be a handful of parking lots in the mosque compound but when I was there, the gate was closed. They allowed me to park right outside the gate though, since it was at night.\n\nThe mosque, while on the smaller side,  is clean and well mantained. There's a couple of vending machines near the entrance. Plenty of wudhu area. The main prayer hall is quite large and the floor is padded.",
