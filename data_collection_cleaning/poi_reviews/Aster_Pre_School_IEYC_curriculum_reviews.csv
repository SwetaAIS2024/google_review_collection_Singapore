Nur Holiday,5,"Amazing school! Sent my daughter here since January 2020. My daughter loves Aster, to the point she would dread holidays, but look forward so much to school days. Very caring teachers and support staff. Spoke very little English when she started, and within a few months was fluent. Highly recommended!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102511184189070829515/reviews
Vaishali Radhakrishnan,1,"Pros: Nice teachers. Friendly. Day to day Activities.
Cons: Cleanliness. Cleanliness. Cleanliness. If you can tolerate this then this school is for you. For me I really could not tolerate this as my son was sick every week after attending school. One week attend school. One week sick. This went on for 4 cycle. Then finally he was admitted in the hospital for Rotavirus. That‚Äôs when we took him out. It was not worth my child‚Äôs life.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107795340549794537422/reviews
