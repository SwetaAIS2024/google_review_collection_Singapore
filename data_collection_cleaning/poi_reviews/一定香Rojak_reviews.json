Loved that they use charcoal to toast the ingredients, giving everything a nice smoky flavor. Added tau pok, youtiao, and cuttlefish, which were perfectly cooked and paired wonderfully with the flavorful paste. My family enjoyed every bite. Highly recommend!",

Rojak is a sweet and fragrant dish which can be an afternoon tea snack, or as a starter to fire up the appetite before a meal.\n\nThis stall used to be at Joo Chiat, and has been around for decades. They upped the standard of rojak by using charcoal fire to transform the usual Ê≤πÊù°Ôºàyoutiao) into irresistible, crispy, and fragrant bites. It makes a whole world of difference to the taste, just like adding the magical wok hei for fried noodle/rice. Their rojak sauce is also rich and thick, served with a generous amount of crushed roasted peanuts.\n\nThey also sell stuffed dao pok, and offer century egg, as well as grilled dried cuttle fish as options.\n\nThis is now my regular spot when I have rojak cravings.\n\n#foodphotography #foodhunter #foodie #foodreview #foodblog #foodblogger #foodreview #foodiegram #foodies #delicious #deliciousfood #goodfood #singaporefoodie #singaporefood #bedokreservoir #rojak #‰∏ÄÂÆöÈ¶ô",
