C.O.B,5,"SOme relief teachers cannot be considered as teachers. They are just there so students won't misbehave. However, these relief teachers cannot control the class most of the time. I think it is also the classes fault that they hate some relief teachers for no apparent reason and misbehave on purpose. I have some very good friends, but also some friends who act extremely unruly and misbehave a lot. I sometimes see this one guy getting scolded by teacher in the corridor and he was suspended on several occasions. A lot of students rebel against teachers and are extremely rude or even racist. Last time  got some students vaping also. I remember in P3 my english teacher scolded my friend for saying ""okay"" at her. She was also sometimes very angry for no apparent reason. I remember i got into a fight with a known troublemaker who has since left the school. However,the teachers did manage to control him and he was quite a good student apart from his misbehaviour. I think that many teachers can do their job well.  The canteen food is good, and the vendors are nice. I enjoyed my time here a lot.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109633734472770449983/reviews
