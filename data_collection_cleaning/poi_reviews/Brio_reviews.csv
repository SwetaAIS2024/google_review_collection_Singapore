Irfan Baharudin,5,"Brio ‚Äì A Gem That Keeps Calling Us Back

Every time we find ourselves in Jurong Point, there's only one place on our minds ‚Äî Brio. This isn't just a restaurant; it's our go-to comfort spot, our ""must-stop"" destination. With every visit, Brio reminds us why it's always worth coming back ‚Äî and we do, wholeheartedly.

The food? Always satisfying. The flavours are bold yet balanced, and the presentation is just the cherry on top. Whether it's a quick bite or a full-on feast, Brio delivers every single time. Their menu strikes the perfect chord between variety and quality ‚Äî a rare combination that makes each meal memorable.

But what truly sets Brio apart is the consistent warmth ‚Äî both in the service and the atmosphere. It's the kind of place that feels like home, but better. You walk in and you're greeted not just with a smile, but with a sense of familiarity and care that‚Äôs hard to find.

Brio is always a gem ‚Äî shining brightly in the heart of Jurong Point. If you're ever in the area, do yourself a favour: go to Brio. And if you're like us, you'll find yourself always coming back.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109184589702713256029/reviews
Doris Ang,5,Have small group dinner. Food is really nice especially the pasta and choc lava cake. Calamari is fresh tender and dip is refreshing. USA Ribeye my first time trying - a bit fatty otherwise it is delicious cos pretty tender. Mushroom sauce is fragrant. Potato puree is very smooth and taste is just right for me. Oh peppermint tea is very fragrant too. Will recommend and come again.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115430332043773943288/reviews

Ken Tan,5,Lunch set comes with either free soup of day or choice of drink.  Chicken and salmon were nicely done seasoned well and not being too dry. Salmon Thai Basil Cream Linguine also tasted delicious with its spicy sour sauce. Salmon was also tender without overly cooked.   Service from staff prompt and great.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100121205735734303463/reviews
Rach,3,"Overall food taste: 3.5/5‚≠êÔ∏è Finally dropped by to dine in at this place after seeing some previous good reviews! I had the fish & chips - a menu item I was looking forward to try after coming across those few positive reviews. I liked that the fillets were rather sizeable and nicely deep fried - not too greasy/overdoneüëçüèª and fries were crisp and light as well. Salad was quite refreshing too. My order came with tomato soup (of the day) as appetiser, which tasted quite ok though a tad lukewarm.

Only gripe would be that the fillets tasted extremely healthy and bland - seemingly as if cooked without any seasoning at all. Not a problem for the super health-conscious; I personally would prefer this to it being overly salty/oily, but may not be to the liking of majority.
My plate was replaced after the waiter initially served the food though, as he somehow noted that the original fillets served were notably smaller in portion size (than pictured previously) and appeared much oilier to me as wellü§î. Kudos to the kind gesture though, much appreciated!üíØ
Would probably try the other menu items if I drop by again in futureüôÇ",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100368288078910287205/reviews
