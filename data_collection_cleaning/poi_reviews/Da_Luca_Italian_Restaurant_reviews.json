The food is so good & I love it so much ðŸ¥º itâ€™s definitely pricier but I love everything about this restaurant.\n\nUpdate: visited again for my birthday this year. Did not disappoint & Iâ€™m still very much in love.",

      "text": "We had a wonderful dining experience at Da Luca Restaurant to celebrate my wifeâ€™s birthday, and it truly exceeded our expectations. From the moment we arrived, the service was warm, attentive, and genuinely thoughtful â€” the team made us feel special throughout the evening.\n\nEvery dish we ordered was delicious and beautifully presented. The highlights were the Bistecca Fiorentina, which was perfectly cooked and full of flavor, and the Crispy Spanish Pork, which had an amazing texture and taste. The Portobello, Parmigiana, Tagliatelle Ragu, and Calamari were all excellent starters, and we ended the meal with a delightful Crispy Apple Tart and Panna Cotta.\n\nThe atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, making it a perfect place for a special celebration. Thank you to the entire team at Da Luca for making the evening so memorable. Weâ€™ll definitely be back again soon!",
