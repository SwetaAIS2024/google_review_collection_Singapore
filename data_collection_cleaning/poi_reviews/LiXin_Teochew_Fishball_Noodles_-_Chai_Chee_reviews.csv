Lim Jaspar,4,"Place is aircon, comfortable. The chilli sauce, mixed together with half boiled egg, is all soaked up by the noodles making it thick and smooth. I ordered the Best Seller No 2. It has plenty of ingredients, making it a colourful bowl. Fried fish cake is a must order, the meat is well seasoned and savoury. Fishball is not very Q and rather bland, likewise the soup. The noodles stole the show although famed for fishball.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115142463215299263560/reviews
CK Woo,3,"Nice place for a meal, lightly air-conditioned but seats not too comfy. Ordered the fishball minced meat noodles, which was well tossed with lard and tasted great. We ordered the fried fish sticks, which at $4 is very expensive given the small portion. Inflation is probably a common reason although I'd think it's not worth the price overall",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107944841982959225321/reviews
Raymond Lim,5,"Came to fix my morning craving! ðŸ˜‚
Spotted LiXin at Takashimaya yesterday evening, but stomach really no more space liaoâ€¦
Still our all-time favourite fishball noodles - comforting, familiar, and Jin Ho Jiak! ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113370341685762605307/reviews
Jack,3,Finally tried this fishball noodles. Felt that the minced pork with onsen egg was rather unique. The fishballs texture were on point but rather bland and tasteless. The soup was also rather bland. Somehow the seasoning for the noodles quite off. Saving grace were the fishcakes were pretty good.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288565584051666357/reviews
Vincent Koh,3,Regular at this stall. Recently the kwee teow noodle is broken small pieces and over cooked. Very bad.  Heard from staff is because their supplier of noodle changed and comes in broken pieces. Hope they improved on my next visit.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100790860144356211925/reviews
