The room is clean and seems to be well- maintained - have complimentary ginger lemon tea which I finished all and a small plate of snacks - good vibe and atmosphere plus the system is well better and beyond my expectations for the price I paid .",

As we visited right after lunch, we had only ordered drinks.  Drinks menu has a good selection.  Service staff was attentive.  Charges was reasonable too. Nice place, will visit again.",
