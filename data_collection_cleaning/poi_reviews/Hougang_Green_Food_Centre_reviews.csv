Leng Leng Kwek,4,"Food wise is ok at this coffeshop. Êª°Â†ÇÁ∫¢ mala xiang guo is good. Reasonable price & portion. U can request for less spicy.
Sub standard tea/kopi. No tea taste. They just keep making tea with same pot of tea leaf, didn't bother to change.
Tea/kopi at another coffeeshop nearby, Foodloft is much much better. They will standby few brews of tea/ kopi so the kopi/ tea taste so much better & worth $ spent. Both coffeeshops charge same prices for kopi/ tea.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106206433682294881172/reviews
