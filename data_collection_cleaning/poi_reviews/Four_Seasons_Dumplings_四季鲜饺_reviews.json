The flavor choices are diverse and very distinctive.\n\nBlack gold fish roe, egg yolk and fresh shrimp dumplings, fresh shrimps with egg yolk and fish roe, moderate saltiness and solid taste.\n\nFresh meat, corn and cheese dumplings, with the sweetness of corn and a hint of cheese, the taste is rich and not greasy.\n\nThe overall taste is good, if you like handmade dumplings, you can try it! It's a pity that I went there late and the cold dishes were sold out, so I have to go there next timeüò≠",
