Crystal Koh,5,"Staff is always friendly, greeting customers warmly daily, and offering help when needed. Not the biggest store around but sufficient variety for most needs, could get cosmetics, skincare, bodycare, and even confectionery products. There’s also a pharmacy here with certified pharmacist to prescribe any medication you may need.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115830770081303202896/reviews

Nam Nguyen,3,"Your average Watson store in Singapore. It doesn’t carry all the items, but you can take the MRT to Bugis to a bigger store.

Very convenience if you are in a rush.!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102008196120489661726/reviews

Amanda Wong,1,"Worst customer service that I have ever encountered with Watsons staff called Serene.
At about 4:45pm, I was making payment at the self service kiosk, however I encountered a payment glitch. So I decided not to use the machine anymore and decided to bring my items to check out at the counter.
However, the staff named Serene said something like this “Why, the self service machine cannot use?”. So I replied her I having some glitch or something, and I wishes to change the payment method to cash. But she keep insisting me to use the self service machine and she will help me use the machine again, when I clearly told her I wish to change to pay by cash.
Whereby the self service machine cannot pay by cash.
She was not listening to customer request and insisted on her way. Not sure if she is doing this so she don’t have to trouble herself to help me scan and pack the items.
I will never patronise this outlet again and very dissatisfied with my purchase and the customer service I received from Serene.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116966249220427420687/reviews
