Beverly -,4,"Came here on  Saturday evening and it was crowded. The tables can only fit 10 pax usually so it was extremely tight for 12 of us. Despite being there early and there are still empty tables, we waited a good 30-40 mins for our food to come! The food was good but nothing extraordinary so not too sure what the hype is about too? Almost every dish is cooked with pork which makes everything very oily

It was hard to get the staff attention and they can senior ones be quite rude and shouting at their top of their lungs. Tbh, there are better seafood places to go.

Won’t be returning anytime soon",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117389095087992565915/reviews
Danny Lim,5,"The cold dish crab is very nice and it's an off menu item, so need to order in advance. The presentation of the dishes are very nice and suitable for corporate event. The service is top notch as well. We booked the VIP room which has karaoke and it's suitable for family gathering as well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104897090385277623528/reviews

Jason Foo,4,Asam Laksa is a must-try—adding extra onions makes it even better! Highly recommend the Beijing Roasted Duck and the 南乳炸肉 (fermented red bean curd fried pork) as well. Great service and reasonable prices. Worth a visit!,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112862571609974826616/reviews
