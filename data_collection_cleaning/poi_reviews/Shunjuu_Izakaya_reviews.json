Given the competitive landscape in the area, it could benefit from being more distinctive.\n\nOrdering was a bit cumbersome due to the digital menu and lack of images, which made it challenging to balance business conversations with our meal selection. Fortunately, the food turned out to be decent.\n\nBased on my experience, I'd likely only return for after-work drinks rather than a full dining experience.",
