It's not usually super crowded so it's a super convenient place to grab and go during lunch break or after work before catching a bus or MRT which is right around the Alexandra Retail Centre",

However, it is very well organised and neat where you can find almost anything you need.\n\nFairPrice always provide better prices as compared to the convenience stores. Morever, parking at this mall is free in the evening where you can slowly enjoy your shopping and even dine at the restaurant after all is done.\n\nThere are also multiple self serve cashiers to help speed up the purchase process. The staff are also efficient and polite.\n\nHighly recommended üòä",
