LexTeo8888,3,"Decided to give healthier food a try and opted for YTF soup but healthy depends on perspective since I balanced it with deep-fried YTF items...ðŸ¤¤

Took more than 25 mins to prepare and if not for fact that they send to yr table I would probably have cancelled.

$5 for like 7 items including bean sprouts n greens is reasonable. Taste wise is alright...better than average but nothing to shout about.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115467381167777606695/reviews
Henry Cheng,4,"Excellent bowl of curry Yong tao fu in Sin Ming area. The ingredients are really fresh and price point is affordable as well. For me, the secret lies in the creamy curry. Not overly spicy but yet has enough heat to it. The star ingredients were the fried egg plant, wu xiang ball and fish ball. Something that makes this stall stand out from the others is that the aunty will serve it to your table. Hence the 5 star for service. Really enjoyable and worth a return trip.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151994390288524704/reviews
Dawn Lim,4,"$3 for 6 items (minimum)! Super value for money. Hard to find in Singapore nowadays.

Great service too. Auntie served me the Yong Tau Foo Soup at the table.

The Yong Tau Foo items were fresh tasting. Each item was full size too. The stall owners didn't try to skimp on ingredients just because the Yong Tau Foo pieces were priced lower than most places. The soup was pleasing though not outstanding. Even the sauces were thick and enjoyable, not watered down.

Overall, an above average Yong Tau Foo stall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113563695447323499189/reviews
Hong Van Nguyen,5,"Had a beautiful bowl of dry yong tau foo with kway teow and sweet sauce. It was one of the best and most affordable bowls of yong tau foo I've had. The fried tofu was flavorful and the veggies were cooked just nice, neither too tough nor too soft. Aunty even served me my bowl at the table. It was 7.30am and there was no queue, so I got my food within 10 minutes or less. Definitely worth coming back for.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112921144002853451738/reviews
William Lim,5,"I was skeptical about trying out the food when I passed by, limited varieties and tucked at a corner. BUT I am WOWed when I tried the first mouth, the curry is so good! The serving is huge, I thought of going easy on an early morning, but I am wrong, so full! The YTFs are hand made and the price is very cheap. This will certainly be my go to place on every Saturday morning.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107163405002724863649/reviews
