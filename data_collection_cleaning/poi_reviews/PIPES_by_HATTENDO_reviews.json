They also serve Sandos (sandwiches), which can be customised to your liking, and also burgers and finger foods as well.\n\nThe atmosphere of this cafe is lovely, with very little human traffic in the morning, and friendly staff. Enjoying my cup of coffee while chilling to the well curated Japanese playlist just makes my mornings so much better.",
