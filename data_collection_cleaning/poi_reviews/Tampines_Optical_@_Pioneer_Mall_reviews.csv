Amy Fung,1,"Very bad quality of product and services .found a lock screw get rusty and broken within 2 months . Then, I get a new replacement for it after waited for more than 6 months . Next then surprisingly , a same problem again happened to the new replacement set with a rusty lock screw within 2 months in used. Now , the staff said there will be have no more warranty.

Just imagined , that you spent more than a thousand dollar for a rusty set of spectacles set and the staff told you that it is normal to happened .

moreover,  the staff  is so rude, annoying and disrespectful. They even can claimed that it is not their responsibility to sold you a bad quality of product and proudly told you that a similar  problem is just happened to many other customers .

I got wearing glasses for more than 30yrs and this is the worse ones in my entire life . Paid for a thousand dollar and it only can be use for 2 months !!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105241221150725874612/reviews
