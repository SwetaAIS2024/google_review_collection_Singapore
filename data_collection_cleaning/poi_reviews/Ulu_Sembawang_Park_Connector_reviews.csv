Alexander Reinaldo,5,"Nice and peaceful place to enjoy nature and exercise. Do take note that pass the Mandai depot area, there will be no lighting, so plan your activities before the sunset. Good place to cycle also tho, certain part maybe difficult due to the rising slope.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108446373348289716691/reviews
khrhms,4,"The actual connector is actually quite a short distance but it takes you to different parks which is awesome! The entrance is near the SLE flyover. Nice greenery, would come here again during sun rise cos I believe it would be beautiful. For walking, it’s pretty easy as its pavement all the way.  I walked through the connector and ended up at Mandai and it was only a short few minutes walk to Bird Paradise. Will definitely walk this path again to go to the Mandai park connector and Lower Seletar Reservoir.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
