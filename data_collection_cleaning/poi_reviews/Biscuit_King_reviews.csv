Robert Tan,5,"Lovely place, saw all my (childhood) biscuits, snacks, candies and even toys at this store.
Bought a variety of snacks there and was given a biscuit tin. Felt so nostalgic",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114207884751744517127/reviews

🔸Location 3/5

Lady boss was very friendly and helpful. Was disappointed to learn that they don't sell biscuits in tins anymore. Was still worth the trip! Bought many toys and games that I was fond of as a kid. They also had a wide variety of preserved fruits! Biscuits are sold at 300g, 500g and 1 kg.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103258312771714193433/reviews
Belle Belle,1,"Went to the store and asked the lady which prawn cracker was nicer as I forgot which was the one I had bought previously.

According to the lady, Bee Bee is her favourite. I then explained the other one seems to be the one I got the last time. She claimed her prawn crackers are replenished every few days so I bought both to try as I believed her that Bee Bee was nicer.

Well, I opened both when I got home and Bee Bee was soggy and inedible probably due to air leakage so it went to the bin straight away.

The other one is nice and crunchy but feel upset that she would promote the 漏风type.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113106583842440360212/reviews
