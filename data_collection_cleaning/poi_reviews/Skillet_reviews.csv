Lisa Awazu Wellman,4,"I’ve had the chicken cutlet burger and the chicken quesadilla so far and enjoyed it. For me, the quesadilla was not enough food to equate one meal, so next time I will add other things to it. This resto is the kind where u get a buzzer and you pick your food up when it’s ready, so expect to wait a little bit for your food. I’ve only gone around dinner time when there’s no crowd and only takes about 5 minutes.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110923392249532160058/reviews
