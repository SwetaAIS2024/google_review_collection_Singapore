James Bolton,5,I was pleased to have engaged this local company for their services. I was able to receive my personal effects on time and paid what was agreed upon. No hidden fees or anything like that. Top down services from permits to movement of my personal effects to what was best suited for me in terms of how I wanted to ship my stuff over (air or sea). Thank you Mr Yong for his kind assistance to my move into Singapore.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102575262546172840912/reviews
Yijun Lin,1,"Mr Yong is an unscrupulous man. He not only failed to discuss packing requirements of my fragile instrument with me he also failed to refund the shipper the cost of door-to-door delivery when I, the receiver, have chosen to pick up the delivery myself and gave instructions to refund the shipper. Do not do business with them.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103219941509982605422/reviews
