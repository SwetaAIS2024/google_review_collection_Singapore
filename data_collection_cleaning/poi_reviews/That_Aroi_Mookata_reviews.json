I would say one of the best at amk. Many mookata around amk are overcrowded, stuffy and hot. This place is so much better. Opens at night. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "Great place to gather with buddies with grill meat selections, slightly different item from the usual mookata places. Another plus is the area has great ventilation no grill smell after the session. Very sincere owner serving. The homemade chilli adds in the kick, luscious dipping chilli fish sauce tangy. Industrial hidden treasure. Plus the canteen serve good range of beers to go with! Cheers!",
