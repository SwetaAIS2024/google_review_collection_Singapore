Abraham Lee,5,Nice ice cream place with plenty of seating and a good atmosphere! Very child friendly and good variety of drinks as well.

Rong Rong,3,"There was good selection of flavours and I got the malty milo and classic coconut which went super well together. Like the ice cream was legit 10/10.
But 3 stars because the male staff had an attitude & it really soured the experience. And the spoon is really short & hard to grip on to ðŸ˜•",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101726148475618759160/reviews
N. Lim,5,"Partner and I dropped by because we live around the corner. How lucky am I to have found my new favorite ice cream place!

Had the pistachio ice cream atop a waffle. Bloody glorious; the ice cream tasted like the cream inside of a kinder bueno if it were pistachio flavoured. Smooth, nutty and rich.

And the waffle? Never had anything like it. Came fresh to order, green pandan batter cooked to a perfect golden brown. Outside was SO CRISPY and the inside was tender and fragrant. Not too sweet. As the ice cream melted, waffle (with the large grid) soaked up the flavours but never lost its integrity. I LOVED IT AND I WILL BE BACK!!!

Only complaint? Please extend your hours, I believe you close at 9.30pm? Consider closing at midnight. My cravings hit during the wee hours and I need this then. Thank you!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109320025741216071178/reviews
