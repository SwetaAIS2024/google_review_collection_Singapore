jamine chew,5,"Always frequent qyls because of the affordable and high quality coffee and matcha. Especially love the oat matcha, rich in flavours but not overly sweet. Ordered a few times for my friends for gathering and the quality is always top notch. The tiramisu is also good. Finally something good in Hougang green :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110349695603919389692/reviews
Jaycee,5,My go-to coffee place ever since moving here. Served best of both worlds with your traditional Singapore kopi/yuan yang with a unique blend  on top of your standard latte/flat white etc. Served by a nice and friendly chap with chill neighbourhood vibe!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100398008123470191868/reviews
Lance Tan,5,"One of my favourite coffee places in the neighbourhood. Affordable and generous in portion, you can get your standard coffeeshop coffee orders or specialty coffees as well. The coffees served are always aromatic and you can ask for customisations too. My go-to coffee place when I’m in the area. There’s not much space to sit for dine-in options.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103171518127946119222/reviews

Mike Loh,5,Cosy Cafe serving pretty decent coffee. Try the iced Spanish. They also do local coffee styles and tea. Tiramisu is pretty bomb.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102343101925691511852/reviews
