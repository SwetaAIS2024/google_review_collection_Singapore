Harsh Patel,4,"If you live far from little india and are debating going to this branch, please do go. The idli were perfect, dosa could’ve been better and vada’s were not fresh. But overall including chutneys and sambar, it was decent. Not comparable to the main one in little india but this is the best in this area! Highly recommend!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103824480589887097124/reviews
