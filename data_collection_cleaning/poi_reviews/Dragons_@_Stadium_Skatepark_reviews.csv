Blackraven,5,"Amazing skate park for running, cycling and skating! Can work out at any time of the day and in any weather because it’s indoors and under shade. Highly recommended for family and friends gathering to do sports together!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114385515451710838076/reviews
Michal Kohút,2,"It's a really basic little skate park that I wouldn't recommend. Concrete slabs are bonded with a thick layer of elastic goo that really messed up my timing.
The mini ramp is nice with mellow transition and forgiving coping, but it is extremely narrow. So it looks like a good place for mini ramp beginners, but it's not imho ideal for learning basic slash grinds etc if you like to carve into it (because of the risk of carving out of it).

There are 2 vending machines nearby and SHOWERS (go downstairs, south-east, to OCBC Arena main entrance where there are toilets and changing rooms with SHOWERS .",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107878588942219327638/reviews
