      "text": "I initially approached Mani for assistance with TVs. Unfortunately, the staff he wanted to direct me to was already helping another customer, he then wasted no time to sought out another colleague to assist me. I was very thankful for his enthusiasm and quick action.\n\nI was then assisted by Zixiang, who provided impressive service regarding the TVs. I especially appreciated his knowledge, straightforwardness, and honesty about warranties, after-sales service, and reliability, and there was no hard sell. I also purchased a Dyson fan with his help, and he arranged same-day delivery. I can't fault him at all.",

      "text": "I was at Clementi mall and looking for a laptop. Muhammad Alif recommended me good model for my business usage and explained very well. While I was looking for it, he proactively and very friendly approached me and asked me what he could help. In addition, and that is the impressive part - there was no stock for that model and he took the effort to go all the way to Jurong outlet to get it for me. This is the 1st I encountered such an excellent service. I have never seen this in other brand stores. Congrats to BEST  for having such a dedicated staff. All the best.",

      "text": "Just had my S20 traded in and brought home my new S25 ultra, finally!! The transfer of my whatsapp data was a nightmare!! Was there almost the whole day for 2 days, trying to get it backed up, but had problem. Desmond there was super patient and very helpful the whole time even though this issue had nothing to do with him. I asked for an extension to let me have more time trying as the data and chats were very important to me (both work and personal). I was there very late, almost closing time on the 3rd day after finally having whatsapp backed up to Google. Yet Desmond was still so helpful and didn't rush me at all. Ensured everything was properly in my new phone before I left. I am so thankful! People like him are so rare now!",
