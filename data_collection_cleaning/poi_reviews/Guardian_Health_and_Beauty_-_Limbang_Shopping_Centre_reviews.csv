Angie Cheng,1,"After past experience, pls calculate the total amount when u purchase anything from the outlet.

I paid without calculate the total price  and shocked when I scan the reciept. I questioned the staff and she said I saw the wrong label. The label was stated clearly assorted shampoo buy 1 get 1 free.  Another shampoo that I regular buy, the label said 18 dollars yet she charged me over  22 dollars... said no discount in blur look. Then I show her the display..she quickly removed the sale label. She told me my refund only can receive 1 week later when the reciept stated for cheque then required 1 week and bb net refund will directly credited back to the account.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116992072626564741195/reviews
