Mika Royce Syawaz,1,The worst customer service in Singapore. My mom wanted to order but the owner keep showing black face to her. We buy the chicken rice not eat for FREE!!!! Please educate yourself in customer service before selling food. First impression is very important. Nobody will eat at your shop ever again.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109296943941038429556/reviews
derek neo,4,"Have been eating for many years, and their Nasi Ayam Penyet was consistently good.   The Chicken thigh was a little dry today but the sambal was still very good.  A little disappointed today but will give it another shot the next time I am here.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113015523826545524096/reviews
Junaida Said,1,"Very disappointing experience. The staff had arrogant and unfriendly expressions, which made me feel unwelcome. On top of that, the chicken was very dry. Poor service and food. I really hope they improve their customer service skills â€” it would make a big difference.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105583342024451977685/reviews
Dennis N,5,"One of the better Ayam Penyet and yet it is fair value for money. Expect a generous portion of sambal + size of chicken.

The dish is well cooked and complimented by the sambal, along with the soup. Even the rice was also fragrant. A hidden gem for sure ðŸ’Ž",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104988888938292694772/reviews
K Yeo,4,Chicken was moist yet crispy. One of the better ayam penyets I have tasted before. Chilli was spicy but sweet. Not the chicken rice type though. Price is $7 now.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110777079223722537310/reviews
