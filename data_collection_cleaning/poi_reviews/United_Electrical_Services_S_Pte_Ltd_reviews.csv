Ivan Lim,1,"Arranged for an electrical troubleshoot to fix a persistent tripping issue. They have confirmed to come between 1-3PM, yet did not show up at all. I had to chase them constantly and their boss/admin had a really bad attitude.

Would recommend to avoid them and look for other electricians.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107691789882847386845/reviews
Jack C.,1,"I got initially charged $480 for replacing these two mini circuit breakers. These two only cost about $100 at most. After questioning them, they refunded me $180. Even then $300 is overpriced when Iâ€™ve got other quotes for only $150 for emergency repairs. Scammers.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107311852599152696714/reviews
Terence Tan,1,"I called them to solve my power outage problem. They quoted assessment charge of $80 which I accepted because it was after midnight. However, the charges to replace the circuit breakers were way too exorbitant. S$1800 just to replace 25 breakers and 3 switches, which took just an hour or so. On top of that, the electrician did not test that the problem had also caused a fused connection at the main estate DB until after finishing the job, so fixing all the circuit breakers did not resolve the issue. I had to wait till the next morning to resolve the outage issue with my estate electrician. Definitely a AVOID this company.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106209156866986371021/reviews
chad ng,1,I called the company to fix an issue with my circuit breaker and they explained that the charges for consultation was $50 for assessment of issue and additional charges will be incurred for repair which makes sense but when the technician came down.  He explained that there will be additional charges to other assessments which is ridiculous and dishonest practice. This was not communicated to me clearly earlier during the call.  I only understand that additional cost means the repair service and part costs.  I will never use their service again.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104486698625307757665/reviews
Jeng Jeng Jeng,5,"Didnt engage their services and neither am i a former or current employee with them, but came across this company when I was looking through lists of electricians and saw the reviews of how many customers were actually that blind to leave reviews for the wrong company. But they somehow still can spell out the wrong company's name in full for this company (you can check the reviews).

Please either check whether youre giving reviews for the correct company, or have your eyesight checked. Its very unfair for the employees and stakeholders of any company to work so hard, only for a negative reviews to be filed when they dont deserve it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104800302928929597182/reviews
