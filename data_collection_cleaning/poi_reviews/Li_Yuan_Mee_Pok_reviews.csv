S T,2,Ah Li no more there and now run by two young men who cannot even distinguish shoyu and miso meepok they selling. Noodles soggy and over cooked. Bunched together in a gooey mess. Lots of pork but taste nothing like what it was before. Sad.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104821661001182224987/reviews
Edwin S,5,"The stall is located at the coffeeshop of Blk 710. It sells a fusion mee pok.

The seasoning is made with miso, giving it a more fragrant flavor, and slight spiciness from the chilli. The noodles were cooked to a good doneness and the toppings were generous. The pork chashu were very tender. The soup broth is also very tasty.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113192406653516830642/reviews
Steveo 88,5,"The Shoyu Mee Pok is definitely a must-try! We ordered both the Shoyu and Miso variations.

The rich, savory flavors of Japanese soy sauce combined with the chewy texture of Mee Pok make the Shoyu variation truly unique.

The Miso variation is pretty much a run-of-the-mill Mee Pok, but give it a shot if you have the stomach space!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103809758512388590124/reviews

The mee pok taste not bad with sweet miso sauce in it compare to our local vinger taste.. The dumpling was really solid and the size of it is really a worth to try it. Soup was like the soul of both item.. it was really tasty and sweet.. Nicez. üëçüèªüëçüèª.

SK Lim,3,"All good things must come to an end .. changed owner again .. different taste. If this was my first time here, I would probably give it a slightly higher rating. But having had the previous versions - which was a 5 for me - I can only give it a 3 for now. ""Re""-opened for about 10 days; so maybe still new and the new owner still trying to adjust. The ""chef"", a young local boy, seemed to be in control of things. Will I be back? Maybe give it a month or two.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102725925646235004666/reviews
