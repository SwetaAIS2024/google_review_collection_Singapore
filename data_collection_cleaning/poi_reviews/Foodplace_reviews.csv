KingKong 99,5,"Located in the industrial building of 163 Kally way.

Just happened to be here at this place for my breakfast. A very new place. Not sure about the lunch crowd. But breakfast here is stress free. Absolutely a bliss.

Think some stall hasn't open for business because it is too early.

The coffee/drinks  stall is run by Teo Chew City group.

Kopi C is thick and fragrant. $1.50

Many stalls here. (See photos)
