Some of the desperate tourists purposely used their rare gate to pass through the walk way from the mall to the adjoining street, and left the door open but staff did not say them any thing and politely went n close the door.\nA must visit and highly recommended place to taste halal food in the downtown Singapore.\nYou will not find easily such a budget food with high ambiance, taste and Halal in Downtown area.",

The service is very bad because they missed our order and were very late in preparing it. The staff is not good because, even though they prepared our food very late, they never apologized or said \"sorry.\" What's more, one of the staff shouted at me when the food were ready , \"Kaka, take your order, number 3.\"\n\nThe gado-gado tastes okay, but the ayam penyet is really salty. I am not sure if the ayam is fresh or overcooked . Most drinks are out of stock; they just offered me canned drinks or mineral water.\nVery Disappointed üòî",
