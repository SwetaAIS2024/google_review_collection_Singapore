      "text": "Tried Mr Onigiri at their new Vivocity outlet! Unlike the usual triangle onigiris, these are more like open-faced rice sandwiches, stacked and wrapped in a way that‚Äôs both neat and easy to eat. Super practical for on-the-go munching.\n\nI had the üçô Kimchi Beef & üçôTeriyaki Salmon onigiris (both $9.50) And it seemed to be a Vivocity Outlet Specific flavour.\n\nThe beef one was moist, flavourful, with a spicy kick from the kimchi that really balanced the richness. The salmon onigiri featured a thick, grilled salmon slab with crispy skin and a sweet teriyaki glaze ‚Äì slightly dry, but the sauce helped a lot.\n\nBoth came with spam slices and cucumber, which added great texture and umami to each bite. I especially loved the tamagoyaki omelette ‚Äì soft, creamy, and seriously well-made.\n\nYou can also upgrade to a set meal (+$4.90) with curly fries or tater tots and honey lemon tea. I preferred the curly fries ‚Äì crispy and seasoned. Tots were okay but could be improved with extra seasoning or furikake. The tea was a decent complement.\n\nPortion size is perfect for light eaters or a quick bite, though I‚Äôd recommend two if you‚Äôre hungry. Overall, a unique and delicious concept worth checking out ‚Äì they also have another outlet in Thomson if that‚Äôs closer!",

We took them up to the SkyPark to eat, which was a nice chill spot with a view of the harbour and Sentosa. Decent for a quick, fuss-free meal. Love their signature crispy chicken & the occasional new menu!",

      "text": "What a cute Onigiri restaurant located in Harbourfront, Singapore! Reminds me of Onigiri cross taco cross burger. The ingredients are fresh and although the combination is simple, each bite is so scrumptious and delicious!\n\nThis is such a good option to drop by for a quick grab and go! Will definitely come back to try their other options!",

Hence I passed by this outlet, it gave me a reason to grab something.\nNeedless to say this was a Savoury bomb, I like the flavors.\nIt was that familiar taste with a diff twist. Recommended to a meal instead, which is more worth it.",
