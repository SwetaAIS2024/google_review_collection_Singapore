We were appalled when we ordered delivery, and they had the cheek to give us individual slices of pizza made into a \"whole pizza\". Who knows how many days old are these slices.",

      "text": "In short: 1.5h late delivery, left food out in the rain, no response from them throughout.\n\nIn the morning, I scheduled an order for 10.15pm later that day. At 10.15pm, order tracker said it was baking. At 10.25pm, order tracker said to rate the order. I waited from 10pm all the way till 11pm and there was no pizza delivered so I left the delivery location. Tried calling this branch, no one picked up.\n\nAt 12am, I saw several missed calls from 11.45pm. I called back and the rider said he left it outdoors IN THE RAIN at the delivery location. Went back to the delivery location and the state of the food was what is in the picture. Soaked throughout.\n\nDear Domino's, I strongly urge you to sort out this poor service. And if you simply reply this with a link to your feedback form, I have tried filling it up and it doesn't go through, and there's no actions taken. If I am unable to successfully get a refund, I can only resort to filing a complain to a higher authority.\n\nThank you.",

Reached back at 9.15 pm and pizza was already at the door, and left on the shoerack, beside the shoes.\n\nOrdered a standard Hawaiian pizza with New York crust. Upon opening the pizza box, boy was I dismayed at the toppings and presentation of the pizza. (See picture).\n\nIf this is the standard of the pizzas that dominos are proud of serving to their customers, I will definitely not be returning. For the price that I paid for that pizza, I'll be better off spending it at other pizza places for better quality.",
