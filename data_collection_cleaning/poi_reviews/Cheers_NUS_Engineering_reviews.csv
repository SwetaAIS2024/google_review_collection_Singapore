Lin Wei Hao,1,"Self checkout counters forever not working. Supposed to be 24 hour store but doors locked from 10pm to 7am. Most times even after 7am doors remain locked.

Was functioning perfectly well before the system change. No worries about working overnight because can get snacks at anytime. Now cannot do anything both at night and during the day.

Day time checkout counters malfunction or payment system down. Night time doors locked and doesnt reopen on time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100239424732604547006/reviews
