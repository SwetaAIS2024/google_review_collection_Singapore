David Mah,2,"Was there back in 2011.. experience was neutral to mild positive. So went back there again on 02Jan2013 dinner time.  Everything was superslow and i could see that everybody who tried to order got the same long wait. The place was only minimally occupied. And you get the feeling that for the lady staff to come and take your order must be your greatest honour.  Never mind.., give people benefit of a doubt..since the last visit was ok....waited waited waited the tea came...waited waited waited.. the order never came. after 30minutes, checked with the lady staff.. must have been some miscommunication.. in 2sec the ramen came out. But the chicken cutlet was cold. I know where to go the next time I'm at T3.",12 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113610567887484993758/reviews
