Belle Oh,5,Drove 30 mins just to try out their dang gui roasted duck and sweet char siew based on good reviews. Didn't disappoint. The skin of the roasted duck is crispy and fragrant. But the meat could have been more tender in my view. The dang gui gravy is really good. They gave us complimentary corn ABC soup as well.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111480789657010313446/reviews
K Tan,5,"Melt in your mouth char siew, crunchy roast pork skin and fragrant roast duck.
Complimentary big bowl of daily soup of the day.
Reasonable pricing and servings size are acceptable. Don't miss the dark color chilli sauce, it's very good.

One of the better roast meat stalls around Boon keng area in my opinion and easy to reach by MRT.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105592887493237423833/reviews
Mason Tay,3,Think the standard has dropped except for the dried chilli paste still maintaining its standard. Patronized a few times in the past and today was disappointed at the amount of meat. Roast duck/ char Siew/ roast port $7.80 and Roast duck/char siew$5.80 - a difference of $2 for 5 thin slices of fatty char Siew OMG!! ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜±,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108195777674730720034/reviews
SK KWAN,5,"By far, One of the best roasted duck, char siew and roasted pork that Iâ€™ve tasted. Reasonable price. Generous with the soup. Try not to add the gravy. Ask for dark soy sauce, the original of meats is good enough.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113997962823401313053/reviews
Javier Tan,4,Hidden delicious roasted meat in the middle of Bendemeer Shopping Mall! The duck was fatty and juicy and char siew was tender with good sauce! Rice was a little mushy but overall still great!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106617631020704357051/reviews
