Fiona Chan,5,"My experience here is nothing short of professional. Mr Benedict who treated my ingrown toenails was friendly, fast and efficient. The receptionist was also friendly and helpful. Post the procedure, they offered good follow up reviews to ensure a smooth recovery. While it’s not a cheap procedure, I would recommend Straits Podiatry for professional treatment.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110601097023389061240/reviews

ChihShyan Pang,5,"Mr Jackie is very professional and friendly.
My knee pain has been troubling me for 1 year+  and was affecting my daily activities.  Jackie did some assessments before recommending me the treatment that needed.
Each treatment was a pleasant experience where he showed his patience and understandings.  His confidence motivated me that I would recover and back to my routine lifestyle, and he delivered the results.
Today, I am very grateful that I am back to hiking / trekking activities.
Thank you, Jackie.  Highly recommended for his service and expertise.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115692589510157899925/reviews
