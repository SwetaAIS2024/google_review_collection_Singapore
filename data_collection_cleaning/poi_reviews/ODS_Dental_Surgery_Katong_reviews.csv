jk kk,5,"I highly recommend Dr. Kausar based on my positive experience. I had never had a root canal treatment before, and I wasn‚Äôt sure where the pain was coming from, as I had no visible decay. However, Dr. Kausar quickly identified the issue with her expertise.

I underwent the root canal procedure on October 29th, and I was quite nervous beforehand. To my surprise, the entire process was painless until the very end. I returned for a follow-up today, and everything is healing perfectly.

The team of staff are also incredibly friendly and provide excellent service, which made the entire experience even better. If you're considering a root canal, Dr. Kausar is the one to go to. She is professional, skilled, and truly makes you feel at ease. You‚Äôll be in great hands!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116780413209428730653/reviews
