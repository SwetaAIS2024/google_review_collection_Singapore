      "text": "Came on a weekend for an early dinner. Location of Suka Ramai Mama Power is at Bedok Food Centre, beside Bedok Camp II (Guards camp). Had Mee Goreng, with sunny side up egg. Order came pretty fast though there was a queue, person taking order was very polite (guy wearing specs).\n\nMee Goreng is intentionally cooked dry, the wok hei is strong, and the serving of mutton bits is generous enough. IMHO, flavor wise it is on par with the mee goreng found in the food centres of Golden Mile and Upper Boon Keng. Definitely recommended.",
