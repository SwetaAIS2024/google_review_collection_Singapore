Mabel Loh,5,"Wonderful dining experience at Gigi's - one of my favourite authentic Italian spots. They make consistently delicious meals (even for takeaway!). Love the homely ambience, warm lighting and comfy seats.

I've dined here and also hosted events, and the venue is perfect for all occasions. The owners Gigi and Sheryl are really kind and the minimum spend is highly reasonable.

The team is warm, really attentive and always makes us feel at home. Coupled with the delicious food, I can't wait to return to try more dishes! A hidden gem that's highly recommended!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107248668293925288713/reviews

Monica Mok,5,"We had our Christmas catch up at Gigiâ€™s this year instead of our home.
It was the first visit for our friends to Gigi Gastrobar & Bistro.

The festive menu was simply delicious with each dish executed to perfection.

The food truly reflects the foundation of the Italian Cuisine -  Fresh Quality ingredients.

From appetiser, main to sweets,
The flavour comes through for every single dish.
It was mind blowing, delightful and the portion size was generous.

The Cold Tomato Gazpazo Soup with Soft & Creamy Whole Burrata for example
was one of my favourite.  The interplay of the bright acidity and roasted depth within the tomatoes is counterbalanced by the mild creamy burrata is silky and luscious with every spoonful. It was so fresh and inviting that I could drink this soup over and over again.

Beef Tenderloin with Porcini Sauce, the lean yet succulent meat with fine buttery texture paired beautifully with the rich, nutty and slightly meaty porcini sauce. The mash potatoes with the truffle oil that comes with the tenderloin
was smooth, silky and seasoned to perfection.

The Cioppino Sicilian Style Fish Stew and Mixed Seafood with Black Cod Fillet reflects the effort and attentiveness by the owner and his team to extract the natural essence of the fish and shellfish.
The stew perfectly captures the taste of the sea.

Enough Said. Seeing is believing.
Sharing some of the  photos from our food choices in the Christmas menu.

31st Dec will be the last chance to savour Gigi's delightful Festive Menu.
If you are looking for a place to have your New Yearâ€™s Eve meal. Gigi is the venue of choice.

Buon Appetito !",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116823865186454167985/reviews
