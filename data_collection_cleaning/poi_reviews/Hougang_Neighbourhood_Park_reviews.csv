JL,5,"My favourite neighbour park! Even better after the recent NRP, with new jogging paths and shelter walk ways!!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111923653431439408688/reviews
Lim Y H Andrew,4,"Rather quiet park with a jogging track within the perimeter of the park and has some exercise fixtures around.
Some of the larger trees are labeled by NParks, and actually have different neon spotlight (pink, yellow, green, etc.) shining on it from 7pm-7am giving it a rather special ambience.
There are seats around the park, so you may rest while exercising.
There is also a basketball court next to the park.
There is also a playground with slides, suitable for kids below 7, best with adult supervision.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107285050100429272049/reviews
SB A.,3,"The neighborhood park now has a newly built basketball court and a multipurpose court, among other things like better walking path and sheltered walkway.  It definitely looks better. But I am not sure if I really like the new park or the original grass patch better. Don't get me wrong - The new park is all nice and new, but it just doesn't have that old familiar feeling of an open, uncluttered field whose existence needs not be justified by a purpose.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116248228033507724345/reviews

Mohamed Malim,4,"Small and cosy park that offers a simple escapade from all the concrete.

However, in the late evenings, noticed people gathering for smoking and drinking (alcohol)

The authorities should get harsh on these individuals.

The Neighbourhood Park is not the right place for such activities.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107759202029739714866/reviews
