Learn with Afeef,5,"Raffles college of higher education is situated in a posh area ofÂ  singapore. Recently I signed up for Interior architecture and design course and the admission process was very smooth. The staffs were very kind ,helpful and supportive. I was recommended when I chose this field. I hope for a fruitful years of experience in this college. I will surely update on my college experience.

Sushmita Salanki,1,Please do not make the mistake of joining Raffles. They do not care about the welfare of students and have committed themselves in various corrupt activities that will consequently affect the students. I wouldn't give a single star if I could write a review without having to give one. This is a very unreliable college and has no university standards. More reviews on glass door about Raffles will suffice. The most corrupt college I have ever come across. The college has no ranking on any websites of Singapore either.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101942236456850694469/reviews
