It's alright
The atmosphere wasn't totally pleasant but the staff was really quick to give us guidance when certain foods ran out and place was kept very clean.
The food wasn't exceptionally good but was worth a try. Thank you for the meal; shall try the desserts to get a more balanced review next time round 😊",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111236572800878713434/reviews
Rachel Yee,3,"A pretty nice place for dessert after dinner. The Thai milk tea Shibuya toast is not too bad. Usually here with 2 friends, and the portion is more than enough for us to share.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111562434976540372363/reviews
Riona Sng,4,"Overall the ordering was easy, and the preparation was fast.

Unfortunately, I was not being asked if I was a member for getting member point, and that after I order, I cannot get any points.

As well as after I brought the drinks then I saw there is free drinks for new member.

The staff didn't mention anything about it.
That's the only sad point",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110695332247112587268/reviews
Riki Koe,5,"A comfy & nice place to have Thai food with milk tea. It's located at Jurong Point level 2.
Tom Yum soup was delicious with fresh prawns & fish chunk. Their fish cake is recommended 😋😋 .
Tried original milk tea with 25% sweetness, surprisingly the taste was just nice 😉
They also have XXL milk tea & serve in a special package.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101883927031130828006/reviews
J Li,4,"You will not find authentic Thai food here, but if you are looking for a quick bite good taste and value, with a touch of Thai, you are at the right place.
I like that they have the option of a petite size for the thick toast. The portion is just nice and it taste great too.
Their beef noodle is generous with beef slices, value for money.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110687871487557983807/reviews
