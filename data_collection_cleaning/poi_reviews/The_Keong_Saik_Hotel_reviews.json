Heard the garbage truck clearing bins at 1 am plus. Quite a good location and the hotel itself is not too noisy. I think it's good for the price and may consider coming back again.",

I stayed in a room with no window which was an attic room and I loved the vibe, there are still windows high up to let in light. It was small but smart in the layout, everything I needed was in the room. The tvs are smart so you can watch Netflix, the reception staff were really nice. No complaints from me. Thanks for a lovely start to my Singapore trip.",

Breakfast isn't bad to say it's included, consisting of cereal, eggs, sausage and toast, as well as fruit juices and tea/coffee. Certainly not a full buffet like in major hotels.\n\nHotel does get pretty noisy with families coming and going during the night, especially kids running around! I had to resolve a particular noisy situation as it was unacceptable.\n\nRooms are small as mentioned by others but it's a great budget option in Chinatown.... Apart from the noise!",

Room is pretty small but clean and well ventilated, preferably for solos , back packers or couples who use the room for washing up and sleeping.\nDue to the busy city around the vicinity it tends to get noisy. Very close to Little india ,people of spice or like embracing asian cultures can hav a visit to the temple. Overall, average.",

      "text": "TL;DR: I love this place!\nI just spent 4 nights at this hotel and I’m quite satisfied.\n- Location: It’s near both Outram Park and Chinatown MRT. Also on the Keong Saik road, there are many restaurants and bars if you love night life.\n- Room: Quite nice. I rent a Deluxe Queen room and it’s spacious enough for a hotel in Singapore (around 20m2). Plus it has window view.\n- Facilities: Basic. Air con, kettle, hair dryer, some coffee and tea are available. On the bathroom, they provide shower cap, bath towels and toiletries.\n- Staff: Super lovely. They’re available 24/24.\nHowever, there’s one thing that I didn’t like about this hotel. In front of the hotel is a site where they put trash cans, and the garbage truck would come and take the trash at 1-2 am. It gets super noisy for about 15 mins so light sleepers should consider that. It’s not the hotel’s fault anyways.\n=> 4/5. Lovely stay. Will consider staying here for the next time!",
