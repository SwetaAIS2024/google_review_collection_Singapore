Something unusual was them keeping and serving the entire drumstick bone, without chopping it up. I guess it's to show the customer that it's indeed the drumstick being served? Taste wise, it was quite ordinary, I still prefer my benchmark stall. Their soup was quite well flavoured though.",

      "text": "The main star is the temperature of the soup, you best believe it!\n\nThis is a crowd favourite in Tanglin Halt market for many years, There's always a long queue, and yet seems to be well liked by many, surpassing the other duck noodle stall which has almost no one when this place is opened.\n\nI ordered the smallest duck noodle soup ($5). Portion was normal but small for a $5. The price point was justified more by its reputation, I feel; rather than the offerings.\n\nThe soup has a nice, salty taste - comparable to most duck noodles. I attest that it is the temperature, piping hot soup; which makes the noodles nice. The yellow noodles itself were normal. Duck meat is nice but the way they cut their duck meat super small, its very hard to get a nice bite. More like shreds rather than chunks.\n\nAs for their chilli, it was overly sweet and was weird when added with the duck.\n\nOverall, from the standpoint of the soup version, this place is almost average except for the piping hot soup, which honestly adds a lot more dimension than stalls which sell duck noodles which are warm rather than piping hot. Overall, I consider this as resting more on familiarity of the past. But at $5, this is not one place I consider going much in the future.",

It was a small portion and I regretted not ordering a bigger one for more ingredients after the long queue.  Gizzards were sliced thinly and tender. Wished there were more hence the regret of not ordering the big portion. No more duck leg noodles at this time. The soup was delicious. I drank every drop. Likely due to Uncle's health the stall is only opened 3 days a week",

      "text": "Finally got to try this elusive duck noodles on a weekday at 6.30am. Overall, nothing outstanding, hence no need to chiong down to try. But if you do, order the soup version.\n\nOn the dried noodles, the chilli sauce added tasted like pre-made ones from supermarket. The noodles were simply bland. Braised duck pieces were rather tender, aromatic, well-braised but portion given was too little. Soup on the side was the highlight, as it was very herbal and hearty.",
