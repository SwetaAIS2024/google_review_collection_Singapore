LongEr,5,"This is a Nanyang-style breakfast shop, similar in style to Toast Box and Ya Kun Kaya Toast, but more customer-friendly than the Killiney Kopitiam listed on the ""must-try"" list.

They offer affordable set meal options, and the staff thoughtfully charge customers based on the set meal price instead of sneakily charging à la carte prices for first-time visitors like some opportunistic merchants do.

Tourists can try the kaya butter toast, a signature local flavor—though be aware that this combination is quite sweet. The soft-boiled eggs can be seasoned with soy sauce or white pepper, depending on personal preference.

However, there are no condiment bottles on the tables outside, so customers must serve themselves entirely. Orders are placed at the front counter, and food is picked up at the self-service collection area in the back, where there is also a relatively spacious dining area. Since all food collection is self-service, first-time visitors may need some time to get used to the process.

The young female staff here are generally polite and helpful, especially to first-time visitors—much better than the rude, ill-mannered, and uncultured elderly staff at the Tai Cheong Bakery next door. The overall pricing is affordable, making it a good choice for solo dining. First-time visitors can start with the classic toast + soft-boiled eggs + hot/cold drink combo to get a taste of Nanyang-style breakfast.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107257477085501290498/reviews
Jean Teo,3,The food taste is quite bland. Chicken cutlet was quite dry. Coffee and drinks were good. Value set meals are average.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108709121689951451756/reviews
Wu Chunhui,4,"It's a nicer kopitiam. But so a bit more ex. Food is good. The coffee is thick and fragrant. The chicken is super tender, could have a bit more gouji but overall satisfactory.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110662446333298278889/reviews

Joy Wilfred,4,Ordered iced kopi and fried hokkien mee. The description of the dish on the website is misleading bc what I got was a dark gravy version with prawns and a few measly shreds of fish that was not fresh. Sambal also not there. Iced coffee was decent though.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109057470622960524170/reviews
