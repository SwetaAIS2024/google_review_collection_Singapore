      "text": "This school was honestly the worst school i have ever been to. the teachers are lazy and puts on random videos that they find on the internet instead of teaching themselves. the grades 8's rn are the worst. they are, filthy and i found out a few of them got suspended. i also know that they were lots of fights that broke out in the cafetria which included biting, abuse, and stabbing. I wont mention any students or teachers name but this school is very unrecommended. the principal needs to show more discipline towards the students. only a handful of students are actually nice. 100% do not let your kid attend this school.",

Yes, it is an international school which means the curriculum is 'internationally recognised' and great for students. The school's relatively new, offering IB and getting authorised for MYP. High school fees, but the school itself is lacking in a lot of facilities, but abundant in equipment that's never used.",

      "text": "双威 但要了吧，过咑了，the visa can't be processed for more than one year, for no reason, the immigration office is like Shuangwei, and the relationship between the visa teacher and the immigration office is very bad.时间双20小时；学院在学校的剧情主要讲述了报报学报走，可以新生时间； This year is even more extreme, the school opened school to the school store bought the teaching materials, I told them it was sold out, the teaching materials were sold out, and I had to wait a month and a half for the teaching materials to arrive. All these things happened to me.\n\nForget Sunway, it's a trap. I couldn't get a visa for more than a year. There was no reason. The immigration department blocked Sunway. The relationship between the visa teacher and the immigration department was extremely bad. The lunch was terrible. It was just a few pieces of fried chicken with some fries. It was not from the school cafeteria, but delivered from outside. The rice was often cold. My two children couldn't accept it. I made it at home every day and sent it to them at noon. Moreover, the cafeteria was super small. Each class took turns to eat. The children only had 20 minutes to eat. If students had conflicts at school, they would call to pick up the children, but they didn't solve any practical problems. This year was even more outrageous. When school started, I went to the school store to buy textbooks but couldn't buy them. They told me that they were sold out. I waited for a month and a half for the textbooks to arrive. These happened to me. P.S., there are many people dropping out every semester recently, so there is no ratio between enrollment and enrollment. Most of the students in a class are Asian.\n\nDon't forget Sunway can't get a visa for more than 1 year. 이민국 is just Sunway. The relationship between 비자 선생님 and 출인국 고리국용 is not very good. Lunch is okay. A few pieces of chicken and a potato dumpling. It's not something brought from the school, it's the kind of food Korean kids make at home every day. In the past, 구내식당이 너레 사지하다 went back and forth to eat. At school, it was about 20 minutes for students to call each time they had a conflict. This year, he went to buy a textbook and was told that the textbook was sold out. .. I had to wait half a month until 吵과서가 arrived. ps. Recently, many people drop out of school every semester, and now most of the classes are Asian.\n\nLupakan tentang Sunway, ia adalah perangkap saya tidak boleh mendapatan visa selama lebih than satu tahun. For a different reason. Makan tengah hari ni Friday several ketul ayam goreng dengan sediti kentang goreng, ianya sent dari luar dan berikan kepada mereka pada waktu tengah hari Pada masa lalu, cafeteria adalah sangat kecil, dan each class birgilir untuk makan hanya 20 minutes if the student has a conflict in the school, mereka akan melkalan dan choose seko anak, yang yang yang yang yang pergi pergi ke kedai sekolah untuk membeli buku-buku teksa saya telangi buku-buku itu telah habis dijali Saya terpagan menenga mentenga untuk buku tex sampai. I hope that everything will happen. ps. Kebelakan ini ramai yang destat sekolah each semester, jadi sekaran tiada nisbah enrolmen dengan status.",
