      "text": "First time trying it. Ordered the lotus leave glutinous rice (the lady said it was limited so try it out) and also siew mai. They also sell a variety of paos but too full to order. They make all the dishes on the spot. Can see them very busy preparing paos.\n\nThe lotus leave glutinous rice has a strong lotus leave flavor, the meat well marinated and it was juicy. The siew mai also taste good. Unfortunately find the overall taste masked out a bit by too much sweet flavor.",

      "text": "Char siew bun was soft, fluffy and filling was moist. Lotus paste in the bun was just a little too sweet for my liking. These were freshly handmade at the store.\n\nThe chee Cheong fun however is plain with no filling, doused in overly sweet sauce. While it was soft, really was not to my liking.\n\nHowever, for $1.40 for the chee Cheong fun and 90cents each for the small buns, I think it's a fair deal overall.",
