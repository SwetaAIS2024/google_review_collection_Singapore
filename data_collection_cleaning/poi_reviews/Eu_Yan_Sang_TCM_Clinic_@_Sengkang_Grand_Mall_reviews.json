Months of swelling for an old ankle injury went down almost immediately following my acupuncture session. She made the consult feel comfortable and constantly checked in while I had my treatment.\n\nSpecial mention to receptionist Ms Jenny who was so kind and detailed.\n\nBest clinic I have ever went to, staff truly care about their patients.",
