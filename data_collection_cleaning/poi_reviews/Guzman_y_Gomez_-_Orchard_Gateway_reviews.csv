Zackery Goh,5,"Guzman has quickly become one of my favorite places to grab a quick lunch! The moment you step in, you’re welcomed by a vibrant atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.

The menu offers a fantastic variety of options, all of which are fresh and delicious. I love how quickly they prepare the meals without compromising on quality. My go-to is the [specific dish], which is always packed with flavor and perfectly portioned for a satisfying lunch.

The staff is friendly and efficient, ensuring that my order is ready in no time. It’s perfect for those busy days when I need a tasty meal on the go.

Whether you’re dining in or taking out, Guzman never disappoints. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, delicious lunch option! Can't wait to go back!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109405400403426765330/reviews

Zahra Panahi,5,"Service is quick, and the lively atmosphere makes it a great spot for casual dining. While prices are slightly higher than average, the quality and portion sizes make it worth it.

Ying Yun,2,"I used to have a very good experience, which is why my recent visit left me so disappointed. This time I ordered the mini salad and it was a complete letdown. The taste was horrible :(( overly smokey and unbalanced, making the dish almost inedible.

I truly hope this was just an off day for them because I have enjoyed their food in the past. I’m sharing this feedback in the hope that they address these issues and return to the quality I once knew. Until then, I’m hesitant to order again",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111226754961106169042/reviews
April Wacaster,5,Typical food court experience in Singapore.  This shop has pretty limited seating. Service was great; they happily helped us sort out choices based on personal dietary restrictions.  Food was fresh and plentiful; my friend and I usually shared 1 meal. Price was reasonable and comparable to what we pay in the states!,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113543815727948646940/reviews
