I’ll keep coming back!",

And it's all thanks to our instructor, Shirley!\n\nShirley was very patient and easygoing, making it easy for us beginners to learn and follow along as she guides us step by step throughout the session :) (We also got to know a bit about the the firing/trimming process too)\n\nIf you want a chill pottery session I would recommend giving this place a try! Bonus point: theres a cute dog in the studio",

The schedule planned is very feasible to complete within 2-2.5hrs and everyone was preoccupied for the entire duration.\n\nNote that they are in the midst of moving (Dec 24) so the event was held at a separate location than registered, be sure to check with them first. The new space is spacious enough to hold ~20 people, really nice!",

They helped us willingly with our work when needed.\nThis workshop is great for those who would like some great bonding time with friends or would like to have a basic feel of what wheelthrowing or hand-building is like. The experience of the hand-building work (excluding the intro talk and instructions) is around 1-1.5hr while the wheelthrowing is about 15-30min.",
