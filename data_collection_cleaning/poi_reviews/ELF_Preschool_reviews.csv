Gaiius Lee,5,"Highly recommend ELF Preschool for its engaging and holistic approach to early childhood education. It's reassuring to see low staff turnover, and my kindergarten children look forward to their ""out of school"" lesson (the school charters a bus to bring the K students out for lessons out of the school every month). I thought that is very unique, contributing to a wholesome learning experience for the kids.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110217785487060609101/reviews
