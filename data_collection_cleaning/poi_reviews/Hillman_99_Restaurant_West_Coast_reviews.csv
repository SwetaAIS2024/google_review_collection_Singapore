Patrina Wong,3,"I don’t think I can afford eating regular there! Dined with a group of nine, but the bill was a shock—over $500 odd. The priciest items? Medium-sized prawns ($66 for 9x), signature paper-wrapped chicken ($85 for 15x), and claypot pig liver ($42). The rest were simple classics like hor fun, sweet & sour pork, pork ribs, omelet, and beancurd. While the nostalgia was lovely and the food was good, the price tag makes us think twice about returning.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105836076151771532121/reviews
Daryn Leau,1,"Been having dinner there for few years and stopped for a year until recently revisit again. Food standard drop severely. Ordered shark fins and was totally blend. The paper wrap chicken meat now are all breast and quite big chunks, not enough seasoning too. The dark sauce prawns used to be very tasty but not now. Omelette also Abit dry. Total disappointment",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113857032571863639055/reviews
lim chin tat,4,"Food just average. The fried rice not the wok hey Cantonese style type. Sweet and sour pork not the crispy dry type. More fatty and soggy. Clay pot tofu was good. The clay pot liver is the star of the meal - very fragrant and tasty. Paper wrap chicken too oily, but taste quite good. In general food is average.

Here mainly for the nostalgic feel. Ambience is good service is good",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900562659252889927/reviews
Eve C,5,"Updated Nov 2024:

Came here again to satisfy cravings. Still as good.

2022 review:
My own time fav fav restaurant. Signature dish is definitely the paper wrapped chicken. I relied on them for my cravings. They are famous for their claypot dishes. Claypot beef is sooooo good! Old style restaurant and love the authentic vibes! Staff are long time there, very patient and nice. Their chrysanthemum drink is addictive. Had to ask for refill all the time. Super popular space with limited seatings. Recommend to book in advance.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews
J L,4,The food is good. The pig liver is tender. One of the best you can find. The claypot fish head is also excellent. The paper wrapped chicken is tender and tasty.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107468013608797202426/reviews
