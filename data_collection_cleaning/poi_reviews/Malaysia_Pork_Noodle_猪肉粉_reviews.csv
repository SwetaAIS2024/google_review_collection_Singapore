MNG,5,"Slow moving queue as the lady prepares noodle and soup individually.

A choice of noodles and both dry and soup versions are offered.

The bowl of noodles was heavily sauced which it a delight to mix the proteins. Lard croutons were freshly prepared and gave it an added dimension in flavor department.

A mixture of lean and minced pork, pig's intestine and liver. They were mainly slivers but cooked to perfection. Pork ball was flavorful with hint of preserved veg.

Lettuce leaves were crunchy and gave it a refreshing bite to it.

Soup is tasty and flavorsome.

I foresee myself being back very soon.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews

Cheong Wai Chun,5,"Rare to find such authentic tasting Malaysia style Pork Noodles. Taste just like what i use to have back home in Melaka!

Traditional black sauce noodles, and soup comes with minced pork, sliced pork, pork meatballs, pig’s liver and intestine. Not everybody will like the pig innards but to those that do, it’s cleaned well and really delicious.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110277802954320740112/reviews
