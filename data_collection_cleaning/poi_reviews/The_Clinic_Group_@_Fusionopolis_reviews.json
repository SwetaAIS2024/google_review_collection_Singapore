Not sure how healthy this place is and most of the time we have to wait for sometime before our turn! Really unhealthy and looks unhygienic\n\nThe fact that it is located in a nice Tech park building, the clinic looks very shabby",

Being sick definitely did not put me in best condition to think. Hope doctor can give patients more time in future to elaborate more without cutting off the conversation. Probably hitting lunch time was a bad idea to go down.",
