Even though the indoor dining space was empty, we were not allowed to choose another table indoors even though we had a large group.\n\nOverall would be a decent place to go if youâ€™re in the area but not a place I would specially recommend.",

      "text": "Delicious food with magnificent view of the golf course. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seatings. We ordered the assam fish tail and prawn paste chicken for dinner coupled with 2 pints of Guinness. The fish was fresh and the portion was really generous. Taste was on point as well. Prawn paste chicken was seasoned and deep fried really well. They were really plump and juicy while still being crispy on the outside. This is a really good place to have dinner away from the hustle and bustle of the city.",

      "text": "Lovely and airy with a soothing view of the golf course if you sit out on the non air-conditioned terrace.\nThe wait staff was helpful and polite.\n\nOrdered the promotional item of $9.90 ++ per individual serving of shark's fin. Tasted average with small pieces of fins. Was disappointed to find fillers of gelatinous fin look- alike.\n\nSignature Golden Chicken did not disappoint taste wise. This dish was loaded with fresh ginger slices and garlic pieces. A must order. Take note that the chicken pieces were all mid joint wings .\n\nPrawns were succulent and fresh in the dish of Broccoli with Prawns. Glad that the chef was light with the salt in this dish.\n\nWould return for a quiet lunch amidst beautiful greens.",

The yam paste was a good dessert to consider.\n\nThey do have various locations for dine in. We opt for the aircon area and it was very retro looking, old school. The outdoor dining areas were nice, just not nice for such a weather.\n\nThe staff were pretty attentive and service was rather fast.\n\nA good place to have a meal, will definitely want to go back one day.",

Troublesome for someone who hate bones) and lala pot (nice but got abit salty as it boils). Also had half a truffle duck (soft but nothing special, ex), and crab fried rice (nice). Next time will just order the 2 promotion dishes and a fried rice. It should be nice.",
