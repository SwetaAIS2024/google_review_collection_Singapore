We love their Curry Chicken and were trying to find where has it moved to ever since Koptiam closed down in BPP.\n\nWe finally found it thru asking around whenever we meet any former stall holder/friends staying around BP.\n\nThe taste of the curry is still as good! Not too spicy. Potatoes inside the curry are just nice, not hard nor too soft. Portion of rice is generous!",
