Zhihan Lee,5,"Vegetarian options available. Fried mushroom appetizers are the standout. The others such as the pasta, quesadilla and minestrone soup were too salty for my liking. Overall, not exactly a veggie place I would return to but I appreciate that there are options.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107428559570189266319/reviews
Mark,2,"We had the pulled pork platter and brisket platter. Could taste the smokiness. Both meats were dry and tough. The beans are made in-house. BBQ sauce was smoky and had heat to it. Made the dry and tough meats edible.

All day happy hour of Guinness 3 pints for $32++. Guinness on tap was ok.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104763403937794512790/reviews
Coco Lemon,4,"Came for the beef brisket, stayed for the ribs. Beef brisket was honestly quite dry, and it became slightly tiring to eat after a couple of pieces.
The ribs however, blew my mind. It was sweet, sticky, and the meat was literally falling off the bones. Enjoyed the beans and coleslaw sides as well.

The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was very nice esp for something along Jalan Kayu..",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110316840536358366225/reviews
Simon Goh,3,"Staff could be more friendly, and more initiative would be more appreciated. The pulled pork platter is recommended. Mushrooms soup and clam chowder were pretty good.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109857245781571006157/reviews
Maximise,5,"The portions are huge and it's really worth the price point.
I love the alfresco dining option.
Very suitable for outdoor chillex and for people who wanna smoke, it's convenient.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104515881866273770873/reviews
