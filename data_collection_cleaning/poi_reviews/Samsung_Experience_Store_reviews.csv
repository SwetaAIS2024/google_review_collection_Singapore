Gayan Chathuranga,5,"The Samsung store at VivoCity is a great spot for all things tech. The staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and always ready to assist with product demos or answering questions. The store layout is modern and spacious, making it easy to explore the latest Samsung gadgets and accessories.

Whether youâ€™re looking for a new phone, tablet, or wearable, this store has a wide selection. They also offer repair services and helpful advice on device setup. A must-visit for Samsung fans or anyone in need of quality tech products!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115580882753025627106/reviews
Christina Leong,1,"I purchased a phone with a screen protector on wednesday and there is already a chip on the protector. When I checked with the person at the cashier, he didn't even bother to look at me or the phone and said that it is like that and they don't have any issues so far. I generally have  a very good experience with the staff but this is horrible service of just one person who i believe is the manager. I don't expect a replacement but at least some attention given to a customer is needed. If you cannot be bothered with a customer with queries and have feedback on your product, then it is quite disappointing.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115945278768117027008/reviews
Yousef K,1,"Worst Samsung service centre in Singapore.They want to loot money from customers as much as possible. Samsung customer care agreed to do the replacement of LCD screen with 53 dollar payment as all over the world itâ€™s proven Samsung product defaults causing the display defects with lines.I went to service centre; but they service manager and the service lady Jenny
denied to do free display change by showing the minor coating damages on the fibre edges of the phone and asking me to pay extra 300 plus dollars for LCD display change.Is Samsung scratch proof phonesðŸ¤”?Peeling of coating on the phone makes Samsung warranty void???Cosmetic damage void the warranty??Means after buying a phone, keep in the same box and keep in the showcase for not void the warranty ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£Simply wasting time and money.Better stop buying Samsung phones!!!Samsung want to do Robbery from customers!!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111677385768595741687/reviews
Daniel Chin,5,Chew's product knowledge was truly impressive and incredibly helpful.  Her customer service skills created a positive and welcoming experience.  She went above and beyond to ensure satisfaction with the entire process.  It was a pleasure interacting with such a capable and dedicated individual.  I would highly recommend seeking assistance from Chew in the future.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103686173659474009117/reviews
