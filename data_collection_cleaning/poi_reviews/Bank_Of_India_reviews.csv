Ruchir Srivastava,1,"Poor communication with the customer. I had some formalities to be completed for my BOI account in India. I called the BOI Singapore branch to check if it can be done here. They said they'll do it. When I reached there after 30 min travel they said they'll charge $10 and if I want I can complete the formalities myself by emailing the Indian bank. They could have told me this before.

I expressed my dissatisfaction but not even a sorry came from them and the staff just walked away. Worst service experienced.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115392518120077296747/reviews
