She got the cheek to raise her voice and say will check. After checking her staff still got my order wrong !!\n\nMiserable portion and tasteless food. Come here if u feeling rich and want to throw money at lousy service and food. Oh u must have alot of free time as well ! They won't serve you until it's at least an hour later.\n\nThe only reason why they got customer is because nearby not much food options when sunshine place was renovating. Now that sunshine place is up. Just eat there.",

Even then, fish was not hot when it came out (the fire that they light below didn't do much either..). Service not that great either btw\nSuggest not to patronize for dine in.
