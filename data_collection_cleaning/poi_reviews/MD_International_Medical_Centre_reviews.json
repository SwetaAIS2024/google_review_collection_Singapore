      "text": "I have registered at 4.40pm , and there were 3 patients waiting in the clinic. Nurse never advise me that there is lots of people who have make appointments. After waiting until 6pm, I went to ask the nurse when is my turn. Then she said need to wait for 2 more patients who has make appointment. I was so disappointed for wasting my time. at the end I have to leave without see the doctor because I was late for my dinner date. It will be great if nurse can advise me on the waiting time so I can visit other clinic if it will take more than 1.5hours. luckily I'm only have Flu and sore throat.",

      "text": "As a past Olympian and representing my home country of Australia for many years I have experienced a range of different hospitals, clinics and doctorsâ€™ surgeries in my world travels. My past 7 months whilst working in Singapore Iâ€™ve had the good fortune to have been directed to the AMDA International Peace clinic in Wheelock Place. My visits to the clinic have always been a positive experience, the staff warm friendly and professional, and when in a new country this is exactly what you want to be greeted with when not feeling 100%. Most recently I visited the clinic for a small illness. It was Dr Don with his normal professional approach and eye to detail identified after tests the early stages of something that if left unchecked could have resulted in something much more serious. Thank you AMDA International, the Doctors and staff keep up the good work.\nRegards\nGreg Fasala\nThe American Club",

Since he left, I'm not going back because I've seen Dr. Lau several times before and let me tell you, he's not the GP you're looking for. He cannot be bothered, he doesn't listen and only cares about overprescribing. He wanted to give me antibiotics for a cold and when I double checked if that's necessary if it's not viral, he said \"so what do you want me to give you? I thought you'd want antibiotics\". Dude, if I knew what I needed, I wouldn't need you. ðŸ™„",

Request that I quickly make a decision or come back another time because the doctor is in a hurry to go off. I've already agreed to postpone my appointment at their last min request earlier yet this can still happen. Wasted a day off and cab fare.",

      "text": "As a doctor myself, I think I am well placed to leave a comment.\n\nThe resident doctor, while well-meaning, has demonstrated an inability to listen and consider basic diagnoses - even when directly suggested to him from a fellow doctor (we only had to see him because of conflict of interest otherwise). He seemed more keen to talk about his fancy equipment - an ophthalmoscope, an ultrasound, and his interest in dermatoscopy, whilst almost completely ignoring the basic condition that we saw him for. These things may look fancy but are definitely no substitute for basic clinical skills.\n\nSeparately, the clinic administration is incredibly inept even at the most basic of regular tasks - submitting my FDWâ€™s 6ME results to MOM.\n\nDo consider your visit - there are much more competent GPs around, who care more for their patients and charge lower fees.",
