J. Kwan,1,"Brought my 2 pairs of sport shoes and asked for the quotation for glue & stitching. He quoted $38 stitching only!!!
I found it too expensive and get a new pair of shoe for this price. Mr Paul rebuked ""you get a new pair"" (in Cantonese).

I'm shocked how can ""Her Magazine"" reported on this Clementi cobbler!!

In the end I made to way to Chinatown People's Park cobblers, charged $20 for both glue & stitching and satisfied with the honest prices and good service there.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103903382810694331109/reviews
