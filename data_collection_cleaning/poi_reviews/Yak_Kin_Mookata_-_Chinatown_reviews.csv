Xling Tang,5,"Trying out Yak Kin Mookata, the popular, authentic and delicious Thai Mookata spot in the town area of Singapore. Awarded  Singapore Best Foods 2023, its mouth-watering flavors truly live up to the hype!

They offer √† la carte options, Mookata platter sets, meat platters, and Lala hotpot. We were impressed by their wide range of √† la carte items and decided to go with those. They had everything we love, including Marinated Pork Jowl, Teriyaki Chicken, Tiger Prawn, Lala, Baby Cuttlefish, and more. The rich and creamy milky white soup made from simmered pork bones was incredibly comforting, and the dipping sauces were equally impressive, adding the perfect touch to the meal!

If you like beef and oysters, they also have Premium Beef Steak and oysters for you to sizzle and grill.

Best of all? there‚Äôs no GST and no service charge!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103954248798037993511/reviews

BurgerNBacon,5,Best Mookata I had for the a long long time. $2 oysters is crazy. We went back for round 2. The cockles are so fresh and love it when it is cleaned nicely. Got to try the tom yam marinated pork and chicken. All these with good pork broth. We will definitely go back.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107014155733117366829/reviews
 ç…æ…¥,5,"Located at the coffeeshop with loud MOOKATA signage just opposite Shake Shack Neil Road & Mondrain Hotel.

Felt the service could be further improved:
- Poor guy was solo-ing
- Some meat tasted under-marinated
- While some had good marination
- No clear instructions
- No menu. Only order chit.
- Orders wasn't confirmed;
- Just told to sat down.
- But service guy was really hospitable
- The meat was good;
- Wasn't too thin, nor too thick.

Ownself found out, they provide some photos at the front of stall.

Broth was clear & mildly sweet.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103383404265528637492/reviews
