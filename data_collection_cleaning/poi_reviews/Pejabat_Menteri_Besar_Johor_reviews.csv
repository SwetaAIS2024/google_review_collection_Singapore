Thomas Chandra Rajah,1,"Complaint Regarding Unpleasant Experience at Immigration

Dear Head Officer,

I am writing to bring to your attention a concerning incident that occurred during our recent visit to immigration.

During our first time at immigration, we had a very unpleasant experience with one of the officers. The officer in question was rude and aggressive towards us, which left us feeling uncomfortable and disrespected. Despite our compliance with the usual procedures of presenting our passports and waiting for our names to be called, the officer demanded that we put down our phones in a harsh and aggressive manner.

Instead of providing clear instructions in a polite manner, the officer continued to argue and escalate the situation, eventually insisting that we park the car and follow him to the office. This unexpected turn of events was particularly distressing as we had already been stuck in traffic from Singapore to JB since the weekend.

Furthermore, we were made to wait from 13:30 to 14:37 by Puan Aishah and she don’t remember what was the officer name who brought us to office without and she also not wearing name tag, and they didn’t give any explanation or consideration for our time. The officer's repeated instructions to wait in an angry tone, accompanied by pointed fingers, only added to the unpleasantness of the encounter.

I understand that officers have a responsibility to maintain order and security, but I believe that this can be achieved without resorting to rude and disrespectful behavior. I kindly request that appropriate measures be taken to prevent such incidents from recurring in the future.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution.

Sincerely,

Thomas Chandra",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103886252752784484158/reviews
