ellejay,5,"Hearty bowl of porridge with thick liver slices, marinated pork meat, and pork meatball.

Meatball was not the packaged kind but tasted quite average, and not a big fan of the tang cai. But other than that it was a good meal. The youtiao is deep fried on the spot!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103392171617097923838/reviews
