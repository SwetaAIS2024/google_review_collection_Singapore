Jonathan Koh,4,"One afternoon around 2:30 PM, I was driving by when I spotted a coffee shop by the roadside. Noticing it was quite empty after lunchtime, I decided to park and grab a quick bite. I ordered a dark soy sauce chicken drumstick served with fragrant rice. As soon as I took my first bite of the aromatic rice paired with tender chicken, I knew I had to share my experience of this stall. The dish was exactly the flavor I had been searching for for years. The rice was wonderfully fragrant and moist, while the chicken was smooth and juicy—truly perfect for my taste buds. I have no doubt my family would love it too!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110322417305771163637/reviews
"Yong Hui, Ronny Tan",4,"+ One of the cheaper eateries near Nee Soon Camp, compared to  The Brooks I and II opposite across Thomson Road.

+ Opens from 6am till 11pm/1am daily. 33 Sembawang Eating House just down the street is also opened till late, but most of their stalls are closed by dinner time.

+ Authentic Cantonese dim-sum and roasted delights/ wanton mee. The charsiew is wonderful.

- No menu or prices displayed on signboard. Prices are slightly higher than other similar hawker stalls, e.g.
@ Wanton Mee ($4.30) Add noodles for $1.50
@ Roast Duck Rice ($5)
@ Roast Duck + Roast Pork Rice ($6)
@ Vegetables 油菜 ($5)
@ Lime Juice ($2)

+ Portions are thankfully slightly larger than usual.

- Hargow was freshly made/steamed, but the skin fell apart too easily when picked up by chopsticks.

+ Seating - They took over another shophouse unit and has 10 more tables over there, so seating should not be a problem.

- However, parking is a challenge. Limited unmarked parking along Thong Bee Rd.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103854866816776797/reviews

Angie Lee,4,"Came on a weekday for lunch. Can park at the back of the shop. Ordered some dim sum (har gau, fried carrot cake, and some beancurd), BBQ pork and roast pork to pair with century egg and minced pork porridge with some friends. Overall the meal was good, if you crave some Cantonese styled homey food.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113079303299361802517/reviews
A T,5,"Update 18/2/25
Came back a few times and today tried Teochew style Claypot Fish Porridge, Porridge is not the mushy type which we like too, fish is really fresh  with some lettuce and ginger slice, yummy!

Update on 9/11/24
lol order same food again!  Check back here then I know.  As usual I love porridge, this is good! Chicken hidden in the porridge.

Had a few dim sum bites last Saturday morning. Carrot cakes was good, soft yet crispy with Lup cheong in it. Freshly made chee cheong fun, and the lotus leaf rice was also soft and tasted just right for us. Siew Mai had water chestnut in it. We dabao back for the kids again! Came here previous for the Bucket Chicken.  They have a huge selection of food here. Yong Tau Foo, Zicar, Chicken rice etc.  just that the smell from the dustbin outside is not bearable for me, so we moved from the tables near the bins to another spot nearer to the front entrance instead.   hope they can do something about it to clear the smell which seems to be from the rubbish bin or food remnants and liquid which might be on the floor where the rubbish bin is…. wash  it off please, for hygiene purpose and a more conducive dining experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110290698573319690288/reviews
