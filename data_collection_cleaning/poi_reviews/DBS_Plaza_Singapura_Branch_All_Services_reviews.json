I needed a financial standing letter with a few specific alterations, and to my surprise, the entire process was completed within just 15 minutes.\n\nThe staff were not only efficient and professional but also very accommodating and courteous throughout the process. It’s rare to experience such prompt and hassle-free banking service, especially for a document that typically takes longer.\n\nThank you once again for your dedication to customer satisfaction. Truly impressive service!",

All transactions were handled patiently yet swiftly.\n\nKnowing that this branch has VTM (Video Teller Machines) helped to shorten my time there. Thankful for customer service rep Mdm Kek Hong See (I believe that’s her name) helping me to get a new debit card issued under 4 minutes.\n\nThank you again for your assistance, Mdm Kek.",

I was expecting to have to queue for a long time for counter service but Chris showed us with the Video Teller we could still get it done. She was also really thoughtful and suggested other services we could get done at the same time so we wouldn’t have to come back. We’re really grateful for her exemplary service which made this visit a breeze!",
