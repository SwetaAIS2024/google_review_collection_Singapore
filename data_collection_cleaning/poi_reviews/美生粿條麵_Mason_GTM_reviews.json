I was the 6th or 7th when I joined and the wait was 20-ish minutes.. not sure if it were big orders or an efficiency issue (they also accept cash only).\n\nMy original idea was a 'bee hoon soup' but almost everyone before me ordered the dry version and I'm glad I took the hint.\n\nThe \"mee pok dry\" was pretty good, the noodles weren't great but the chilli more than made up difference. The soup version was a tad bland in my opinion and I won't repeat that the next time I'm here.\n\nDefinitely coming back.",
