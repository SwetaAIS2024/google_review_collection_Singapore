O the peace and serenity one could experience if it wasn't so crowded! Would come on a weekday instead of a weekend the next time.",

      "text": "Awesome hiking place to take a walk along the 900-metre boardwalk. One of the oldest reservoirs in Singapore, previously known as Kalang River Reservoir or Peirce Reservoir, it was renamed Lower Peirce Reservoir. Peace & tranquility with lots of trees (over 100 years old!), flora, ferns & wildlife to observe. Fresh crisp air in the morning great place to get some exercise as well. Put aside 1 to 2hrs for the visit to enjoy the area. Outdoor parking is available less than 40 meters away. Will return again.",

There's even a fishing ground for the young and old. I'll definitely recommend everyone to take a hike over here at least once in their lives..!! PS: \"Beware\" of the wild boars, monkeys, chickens and squirrels..!!",

      "text": "Love how serene this place is. It's an extremely easy trekking option, great even for young children or seniors. In fact, I have seen strollers or people in clutches embarking on the trails here.\n\nBe prepared to see plenty of wildlife here. Over the past walks that I've taken, have seen squirrels, monkeys, chickens, and once or twice, boars and monitor lizards. Harmless though. Also love the trail along the reservoir - can spot tortoises, fishes, and some birds.",
