      "text": "Avoid this store! they scammed us!\n\nI ordered a plain + egg prata and a cheese hotdog prata. When I went to pay, the total came to $8.80, which seemed a bit high compared to other places, so I asked for a breakdown. The man claimed the plain + egg prata was $3.30, which was fine. However, he then said I ordered a cheese hotdog with egg prata for $5.50?! The cheese hotdog alone costs $4, and the egg is $1.50.\n\nI made it clear that I didnâ€™t order the cheese hotdog with egg prata, and when I looked at my prata, there was no sign of egg in it. There wasnâ€™t the distinct yellow/orange colour of egg yolk, nothing. He charged me an extra $1.50 for something I didnâ€™t get, effectively stealing from me.\n\nThis kind of dishonest pricing is unacceptable, and I would strongly advise against patronizing this shop. They misled us, overcharged, and didnâ€™t even provide the food they claimed to serve. Please be cautious if you decide to visit.",

From my perspective, ever since the reopening, food quality and service has gone downhill.\n\nThe food served here was nothing but mediocre, there was nothing special about the Mee Bakso despite the outrageous price. $9.90 for something so unremarkable. ðŸ«·The Indian food stall too was forgettable, despite its affordability . Not to mention stall named MANNA, portion and quality can be improved as it is not worth $9.90 for ala carte meals, itâ€™s average just like any other western stalls, no specialty.",
