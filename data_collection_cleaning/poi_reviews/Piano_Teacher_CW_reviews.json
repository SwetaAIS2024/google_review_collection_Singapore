Having no musical background, I knew that having an experienced, patient teacher who could flex according to my learning pace was critical.\n\nCheng Wei is a wonderful teacher. She makes sure that I first master the fundamentals (e.g. scales) and has also provided me with very clear advice on form and technique. This has allowed me to develop a strong base which has accelerated my pace of learning. Very important as a working adult with sometimes limited practice time.\n\nAlso, she is highly experienced and her lessons are always tailored to my ability and ambitions. Already targeting several key learning milestones next year!",
