      "text": "As one of the educators who helped build the infant care programme at Mosaic Preschool, this has been a deeply personal and meaningful journey. Together with my colleague, we poured our hearts into every detail—from designing the environment to crafting a curriculum filled with love, rhythm, and purpose.\n\nWe wanted this space to feel like a second home, not just for the babies, but also for the educators working here—to give them a sense of rhythm, ritual, and respect in their daily care. A beautiful, inviting environment makes all the difference when you spend 8 to 24 hours a day in it.\n\nIt’s been a privilege to grow this precious project from the ground up, and I’m truly proud of the care and community we’ve created for every child and teacher who joins us.",

I have had the privilege to witness how much she has grown into an active, curious, confident and loving toddler with strong passion for learning under the care and love of a team of professional and driven teachers. Her bonding with teachers has always warmed my heart and I am sure she has formed so many sweet memories of her days in school. Wouldn't give a second thought recommending Mosaic to other parents :)",
