Chika,5,"Steven is an outstanding stylist! I had tried many salons for hair rebonding, but none worked out. Then a friend recommended this place, and after trying it, my hair is in fantastic condition. Not only is his rebonding great, but his haircutting skills are also amazing. Iâ€™ve been coming here for around 7-8 years, and now my daughter comes here too for her haircuts. Totally worth the money!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104586379804996004202/reviews

Enzo Buttazzoni,5,"Was charged $18 for a very decent male haircut. I am very picky about basics: symmetrical sides, even shaving, appropriate length, clean finishing.
