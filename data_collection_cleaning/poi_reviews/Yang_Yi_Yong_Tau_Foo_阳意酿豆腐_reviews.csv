Benito Linus,5,You canâ€™t go wrong with the Yong Tau Foo from this stall. They have big fried minced meatball which I loved it very much. Dry yellow noodle with chilli+sweet sauce is a must!! Very satisfying and totally worth the carbs!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114106152376985360330/reviews
