If you’re not a meat eater, there’s noodles with vegetables. They also have their signature dishes for one person. I had the basic wonton in soup. The broth was perfect and tasty. Just like the way my mom used to make them.\nService: 5/5 - friendly and prompt\nAtmosphere: 4/5 they’re located in the basement of the food court at Marina Bay shopping area.\n\nIt’s the best wonton soup I have had in ages.",
