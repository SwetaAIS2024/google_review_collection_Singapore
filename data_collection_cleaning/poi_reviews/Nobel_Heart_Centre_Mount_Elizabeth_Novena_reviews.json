He does not do unnecessary test or prescribe very strong medicine which has side effect. Both my parents see him and are extremely comfortable with him. He is like an old friend to them.\n\nAlso, kudos to the nurses who always provide excellent service and make every visit a pleasure. Thank you Dr Leow and team.",
