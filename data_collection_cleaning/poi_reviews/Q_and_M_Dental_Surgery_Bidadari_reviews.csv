wendydaisy,5,"I just had an amazing experience with Dr. Janelle at this new clinic! From the moment I walked in, the whole team made me feel really comfortable. Dr. Janelle was super thorough and explained everything clearly, which I really appreciated. They use this cool iTero scanner that gave me a detailed look at my tooth and gum health—way better than any regular x-rays I’ve had before. I left feeling really confident in my dental care. Highly recommend Dr. Janelle ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️& this place if you’re looking for a great dentist!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100005906967860799547/reviews
Michelle Chong,5,Dr Janelle attended to me for scaling and polishing. I was running a little late from work into their closing hours (so sorry about it) and that didn't stop her from being patient and gentle with my teeth. She took time to explain what was going on with my teeth with the AI scan (super cool btw! It's a quick scan with some lights flashing and you have your teeth on screen in the next 3-5min) and was logical with advising if braces was needed. No unnecessary pain and bleed during the scaling and polishing too. Will definitely recommend! She managed to cleared off my coffee stain on my teeth too!,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113892847267959481420/reviews
adrian king,5,"Dr Goh is very meticulous in cleaning my teeth, all my Toastbox, Yakun teh stain is gone! and she is skillful, I don’t feel any pains nor any discomfort at all.
The clinic made use of advanced itero scanner to scan my teeth (I can see how exactly my teeth looks like in 3D!) and Dr Goh patiently using the on screen 3d view to explain to me teeth condition.

The nurses are friendly too, definitely recommend this dental clinic!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111837335915778011572/reviews

Nicholas Loh,5,"My dentist here is Dr Janelle Goh.

She’s very gentle and has a calming presence despite my nerves. She takes time to explain to me when I have doubts and clarifies my options.

Saw her for scaling/polishing, dental filling, root canal, and crown installation within the span of a month.

I’m usually quite finicky about dentists but I am glad that our neighbourhood dentist is one that suits my needs.

The outlet is clean, quiet and usually easy to get appointments which is a plus.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101569660725992734742/reviews
