      "text": "A legitimate TCM clinic with registered doctor and therapists!\n\nEven the front desk lady is trained and able to judge my medical condition, followed by proper treatment by an experienced therapist. I was there for a knee injury after my holiday overseas. After physical examination, treatment was extended to my back, which was diagnosed as related. I am able to walk properly with minimum pain at my knee and felt much better. Treatment process is careful and different from many other TCM which exerts stronger forces which causes pain.\n\nClinic ambiance is soothing and good for treatment. I actually slept after a little while into treatment. Price is reasonable and all staff is friendly and helpful.\n\nDo make appointment if anyone wants to visit as the bookings are normally full.",

I’ve been coming back weekly.\nEveryone there was friendly and patient in explaining my conditions.\nThe location is convenient and highly recommend for people looking for TCM treatment.",
