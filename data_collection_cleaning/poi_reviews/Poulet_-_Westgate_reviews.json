Hopefully they have more variety speciality from the selection.\n\nThey have decent service and atmosphere thou. Abit noisy due to crowded mall setting up",

Always long queue at causeway point site..saw one outlet at Westgate and why not...\n\nThe duck and mushroom croquette was really superb!! Like legit! 3 wasn't enough tbh. Lol\n\nBoth spicy sausage pasta  (with clam and not with clam) was alright. Not spicy to us. Maybe cause the visual was so amazing and look delicious, that I totally forgot to take photo first. But yeah, taste was alright.\n\nDessert, Choco creme brulee was legit awesome too! It was mix of sour, sweet and bitter! Sour due to raspberry, sweet due to the crystalized sugar and bitter due to dark chocolate.",

That said, food is still awesome and i really like it! Value for money and great taste. Staff were polite and prompt in their service. Good variety and choice of food!",
