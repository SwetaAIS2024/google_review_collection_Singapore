This is the crispiest peanut pancake (meejiangkueh) Iâ€™ve ever tasted.\n\nItâ€™s not very sweet and has a little bit of saltiness to balance out the flavour.",

      "text": "This is the ultimate crispy peanut pancake that satisfy all my craving.\n\nHave never been a chewy minjiang kueh person and had a hard time finding the crispy version which I prefer. Like all fellow foodies, I did a google maps search, found this place and saved it on the map waiting for a chance to pass by. Lucky day indeed.\n\nThe pancake was freshly made to order and it arrived warm. The Ying and Yang was showcased perfectly in this pancake. You have the crispiness on the outside while being chewy on the other inner side. The fillings of crunchy peanuts was complemented by the softer corn bits. How lovely.\n\nBest of all, I love how this is so light on your stomach which unlike the typical minjiang kueh, wouldnâ€™t make you fall into a coma after enjoying.\n\nThe owner was extremely kind and friendly. Would definitely be back to try out their savory options! ðŸ˜‹",

I got the Luncheon bomb (Luncheon meat, cheese and egg). Very crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and delicious!! ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹\n\nUpdate: Came here to try the Floss bomb and I think I still prefer the Luncheon",

Their pancake is a good mix of soft in the middle and crunchy at the corners.\n\nAs our third time coming here, we ordered:\n01 x Floss, Luncheon Meat, Cheese & Egg (endearingly known as HPL)\n01 x Floss & Egg\n02 x Nutella & Peanut\n\nWe loved it!\n\nWaiting time could be up to 25 minutes during rush hour. Ordering online can only be done on Deliveroo, but it does not deliver to all places.\n\nThe seating spaces limited, so itâ€™s better for takeouts.",
