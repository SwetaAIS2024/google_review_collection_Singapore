      "text": "The hearing aids offer very little improvement, only slightly enhancing hearing. They're difficult for seniors to use independently, especially with constant volume adjustments needed when moving through different environments. The design is outdated and bulky, and the devices are not easy to put on, particularly for elderly users. Additionally, the devices are fragile‚Äîthe wires break often, and repairs take up to two weeks.\n\nHearing aid manufacturers, such as Phonak, overstate the capabilities of their devices, making them appear far more advanced than they actually are. To make matters worse, most audiologists selling these devices are not fully transparent about their drawbacks.\n\nThe service and expertise at 20dB Digisound, are okay‚Äîneither great nor bad. The staff are nicer when trying to make a sale, but it‚Äôs clear that after-sale service lacks enthusiasm, though this is somewhat expected.\n\nI highly recommend doing thorough research before investing thousands of dollars in hearing aids. Seniors in Singapore can check eligibility for subsidies under the Senior Mobility Fund (SMF), covering up to 90% of the cost.",

Ms Gan from 20db contacted me immediately upon sending them a message and set up an appointment that is suitable to my timing. Very friendly and professional staff! Ms Wong attended to me during the hearing tests and she was very assuring and gave many advices on protecting the hearing! Would recommend to seek check up with them or consider their hearing aids too.",
