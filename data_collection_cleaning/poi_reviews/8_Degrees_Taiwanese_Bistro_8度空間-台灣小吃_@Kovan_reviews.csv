tickledhungry,5,"3rd time visiting and the food is really good and well priced. Recommend the braised pork rice, spiced salt fried chicken and the bubble tea ramen (if you’re feeling adventurous!). The drinks were great too. We tried their signature bubble tea and honey ginger and we loved them both. Outdoor seating is pet friendly but do note there are limited outdoor tables.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108083070890980531306/reviews
Cassandra,4,"I recently visited 8 Degrees Taiwanese Restaurant and decided to try their highly rated Bubble Tea Ramen. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a letdown. The combination of bubble tea and ramen just didn’t work for me—it tasted really weird, and the flavors didn’t blend well together. It was definitely overrated, but to experience this blend, worth to order but just for sharing, not as a main course.

That being said, the rest of the food was pretty solid. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the scallion pancake was crispy and delicious—definitely worth trying if you're there. The milk tea was also great, refreshing, and complemented the meal nicely.

Overall, while I wouldn’t go back for the Bubble Tea Ramen, the other dishes made the visit worthwhile. If you're in the mood for some good Taiwanese food, I’d recommend sticking to the more traditional options.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117012786490278517792/reviews
Gavin Chai,3,"8 Degrees or 八度空间 is Taiwanese bistro named after Jay Chou's song which serves typical Taiwanese food and snacks. Located within stone throw distance from Kovan MRT, this little shop attracts many patrons during dinner time.

Braised pork rice, salted fried chicken, scallion chicken rice and Boba tea are among the few popular choices and they even came out with Boba Ramen for a cheeky twist.

Personally, I don't really like their food as it is not authentic Taiwanese taste as they claimed but it's not entirely bad either. The Boba tea on the other hand is good and chewy.

Their prices are affordable with decent dining environment as a plus point.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111531668040893577385/reviews
Kuah Ivy,5,"Came during off peak ( before 6PM). Have plenty of seats. If come later will be crowded. Food was great and hot bubble tea was also nice to drink. I ordered Sesame cold noodles, the dish were light and noodles were springy.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102308605305458813277/reviews
Edmund Liu,4,"Amazing Taiwanese food, hidden in a quiet gem at Lowland (Kovan). Their bubble tea ramen with chicken cutlet is quite something, a quirky taste that is also yummy at the same time. Special mention also has to go to their pickled radish egg omelette and egg cheese floss crepes which complimented the ramen and mee sua well. Another worthy food haunt to visit! Value for money? Yes.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113549785251310386567/reviews
