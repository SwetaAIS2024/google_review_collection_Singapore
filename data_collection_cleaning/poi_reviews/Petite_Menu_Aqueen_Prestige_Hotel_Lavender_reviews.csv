Kai Ang,4,"Was hungry for lunch and passed by this restaurant and happened to see their set lunch promo for $9.90. Decided to take settle lunch at this restaurant. Count my blessings, for $12.90, I ordered Fish and Chips and the Chicken Chop set meal which offers salad free-flow and mushroom soup free-flow.

The mushroom soup was delicious, better than some restaurants out there.

Chicken chop was fragrant and flavourful, really delicious. Fish and chips, the fish was soft, batter was not too thick and was easy on the palate.

On top of both salad and mushroom soup, there was ice cream free flow.

Really worth coming here when you're nearby and looking for something value for money.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109243066204698468213/reviews

Stephen Chan,5,"Went for weekday lunch set at 9.99

Small sitting area but comfortable, total seating space should be about 40pax

For set lunch of 9.99, you get a main course to choose from 5-6 choices (range from chicken chop, lamb, steak, salmon, and 1 more), a soup, and ice cream.

Add 3.99 will give access to salad bar and a drink (coffee n tea need to add a dollar)

Overall food quality is not bad, spread of salad bar is good. Considering all are refillable except for main dish, it is worth the price tag. Portion is good also.

Recommend to try out for a lunch if one is working near by.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108711393760807024777/reviews
