Zatarie Hoe,5,"Recently opened new fishball noodle and laksa place. Their chilli is amazing! Fishball is springy and fresh. Boss mentioned that all his noodles and ingredients are made fresh the day before.

You can see many people having a hearty bowl of laksa. They close around 1-2pm when they are sold out so come early! Food is amazing and affordable. Would definitely support here more often.
