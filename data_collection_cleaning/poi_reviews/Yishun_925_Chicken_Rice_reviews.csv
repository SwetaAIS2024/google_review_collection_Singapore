tee Kiew lim,1,"Terrible attitude and staff bed service. Today, at around 12.30pm I ordered half portion of steam chicken intended to consume it 3 hours later, and told your staff not to put the soy sauce into the chicken. Unfortunately they put the sauce into the chicken, and I highlighted to them and was being told off that it is their practice here to do so. They even told me to put the chicken into the fridge and eat later. If I would have known if they are so rude, I wouldn't have patronize the stall.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102024703563395307061/reviews
Angelina Angle,2,Found the meat of Chicken Drumstick's portion is half of usual portion only. Finished the chicken while my rice still left 3/4 portion haven't finished. The chicken rice taste good but the chicken meat's portion really too less,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100373202779329959919/reviews

Dev Kumar,5,They can customize the order to my style (drumstick rice with additional thigh meat no bone no skin) and the taste is incredible compared to normal dry chicken rice.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107121174880896000617/reviews
Selene Keng,1,"Went to this stall to take away chicken rice with my tengkat. Realized that I didn't take chili sauce from staffs after returning home, I went back to get the chilli which is a must for chicken rice. I told the staff that I've forgot to ask for chili sauce from them earlier, one of the older staff passed me the chili and commented that he had given me the chilli sauce earlier. I told him I use tengkat, the staffs didn't pass me the chilli sauce, the chilli sauce is not given to me at all, NOT EVEN ONE PACKET. Really spoilt my day and why this kind of accusation that I'm trying to take advantage and ask for more CHILLI SAUCE.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113626775963591177987/reviews
