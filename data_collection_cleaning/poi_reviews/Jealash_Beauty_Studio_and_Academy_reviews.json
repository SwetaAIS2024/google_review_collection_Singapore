      "text": "I recently had the pleasure of taking an signature eyelash extension basic + advanced course with the incredible Juju, and I couldn't be more impressed. From the moment I enrolled, the admin, Elliot, made everything seamless and welcoming.\n\nJuju's dedication to her students is unmatched. Not only does she provide every single piece of equipment needed for the course, but she also goes above and beyond by supplying enough materials to give extra people a brand-new lash set. It's truly astounding!\n\nWhat sets Juju apart is her unique offering of a free eyelash pod—the first of its kind in Singapore. This, coupled with her transparency and the fact that there are no hidden prices, makes her classes an absolute delight. Juju's expertise and genuine care for her students make her the best eyelash extension coach in Singapore.",
