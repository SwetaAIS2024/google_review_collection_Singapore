Yifat Lesker,5,"Smash Tennis Academy has been fantastic for my 8-year-old daughter! She's been attending group lessons with Coach De En for two years now, and she's grown so much. The classes are small, up to 4 kids, so she gets plenty of attention. Coach De En is great with kids, making the lessons fun and engaging. My daughter is now able to play and really enjoys tennis every week. Highly recommend!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103046711942579265393/reviews
Elsa Zhu,5,"The coach and staff are all very friendly, and communication is comfortable and pleasant. Coach Wilson easily spotted my mistakes and corrected them in an easy-to-understand way, allowing me to quickly grasp the essentials and get into the proper state. I've already recommended them to my friends and neighbors ✌️ I hope I can learn to play tennis correctly with ease and joy soon! haha​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117503481711313252329/reviews

Kristin Cavalheiro,5,"Every week we look forward to our Saturday sessions with De!
He's patient and even though he is coaching 2:1, he is able to tailor and modify for what each of us needs to work on during our practice.
We already see such an improvement from our first session and can't wait to put our skills to practice when we play our friends.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105716395158669182867/reviews
