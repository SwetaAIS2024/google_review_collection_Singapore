Della Claudia,5,"We bought Frozen Theme Cupcake macaroon and it was absolute perfection. The cupcake was moist and fluffy, the frosting was creamy and rich, and the flavors were expertly balanced.

The presentation was also top-notch - the cupcake was beautifully decorated with intricate designs and colors that matched the flavor theme.

But what really impressed me was the customer service. The staff were super attentive and friendly.

Cant wait to try more of their delicious cupcakes!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117925259335317929949/reviews
Eyvon Marie Neo,5,"The cupcakes were absolutely beautiful! I ordered them for my son's birthday, and he loved them. I had requested a brighter tone for the rainbow cream, and they nailed it perfectly. The cupcakes were super light and delicious â€“ everyone enjoyed them. I even requested a change in the delivery mode rather last minute, and they were so accommodating. Highly recommended!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102201885881494331989/reviews
BeeDawn Po,4,"Hi tiramisu fans! I finally ordered Annabella keto. Yes and this time was impulsively thru grab cos I was craving for it! This was sin indulgence, ugh! So i needed a low carb one right, cos I didn't work out lor. I was hesitant and thought to myself, it won't taste as good cos its keto. As you can see it came frozen, I let it thaw, patiently. ..I did make a video but somehow i couldn't attach it. gota brushed up my skills here, my apologies...I cut the cake into 3 rectangle size. And satisfy my cravings. To my surprise, it taste as good and real 'non-keto' ones :)))..next time i want to sin with low carb, I will go to ANNABELLA.  tYVM FOR YOUR CREATIVITY leh. Staying open-minded help me this time, if not, i would have ordered or try you guys. Keep up the good work. The packing, candles, card were great too. As my birthday is coming soon in early april, comes in handy. No regrets!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101718868009780141776/reviews
Sheena C,5,Bought the Frozen themed cupcakes and macaroons for my daughter's birthday celebration held in school. Loved the tiny details of the snowflakes on each cupcakes and the characters on the macaroons. Glad that the sweetness was just right (If not we parents will need to deal with sugar-rushed kids!) The ordering and enquiring to the delivery process was very smooth too! 100 Points!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114524650364662513482/reviews
