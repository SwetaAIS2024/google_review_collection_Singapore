Kai,4,"It's great to have a 24hr cafe in punggol for late night cravings or just a place to chill after movies.

Nice seating, fairly quiet at times, good atmosphere. Friendly and helpful staff.

Food could taste a little better though. Coffee is good.

Pastry puffs are 4/5
Breakfast 11.90 deals are bland but well valued considering the inclusion of coffee.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103961412486889059100/reviews
Sushiliah Devi,5,The atmosphere at this cafe is pretty quiet for a catch up conversation with an old friend. The coffee served was good and creamy. I enjoyed my hazelnut latte. Area is spacious and quiet for you to do your homework or to work on your computer. Price is reasonable.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109788552494394660918/reviews
johnnykuochung,4,"Life in the F&B industry teaches you one thing very quickly: you’ll meet every type of guest imaginable. There are the kind ones who make your day with a smile or a “thank you,” and there are the ones who test your patience—demanding, entitled, or just in a bad mood.

Every shift feels like a new chapter, with new characters walking in and out of your life.
Some guests are understanding, even when things go wrong. Others? Not so much. They complain about the wait, the food, the temperature—anything they can.

And no matter how tired or stressed you are, you have to keep smiling, stay professional, and solve their problems.

By the end of the day, I’m drained. That’s when I head to Coffee Bean for my little ritual: a plate of Spicy Tuna Spaghetti.

It’s a small reward after dealing with the unpredictability of the day. Sitting there, away from the chaos, I take that first bite of pasta, and the world finally slows down. The spicy, savory sauce and the comforting carbs feel like they’re recharging me, piece by piece.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110803765536711118720/reviews
bh,4,"The breakfast offered are pretty solid and well prepared. Service is good too. Our only gripe is that the environment is hot when the mall closes and near unbearable during early breakfast hours (7-8+), they have air conditioning installed inside but these don’t seem to help much.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111872021927120413017/reviews
eVe Cheah,3,$10.9++ for two sets (One for one promo). I personally don't like the taste of their hash brown. The bread taste average. The coffee is always good. I was expecting they serve the coffee to me in ceramic coffee mug instead of paper cup since I'm dine-in.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110056024203625910707/reviews
