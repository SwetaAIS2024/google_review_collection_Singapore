Ivan Lam,4,Great place to come for a hit without having to worry about the weather since it is fully sheltered from the rain and sun. And there are not many sheltered court in Singapore especially in the west side. Good thing is that you can easily book the court via their online booking system. The court might be abit hard to find you are going there for the first time since it is located inside the Alexandra Park Estate.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112403987693678430009/reviews
Hieu Le,4,"The location is not accessible via public transport. Plus point is that the facilities are weather proof. However, it's not very well managed overall. Nobody at the front desk. Tip: book court 1 if possible since this court is separated from the rest so you dont have to worry about mixing up your tennis balls with others",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112374790473780649005/reviews
Nicholas Tan,4,"Very secuded area with lost of privacy with an in-door tennis court however suggest to drive else a long walk to this place. Price a little steep per hour but you pay for what you get. One last thing, donâ€™t bother to buy package, you may not get priority for that.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102849965021143994182/reviews

Julian Foo,5,"Amazing place to come for a hit if you ever need to find indoor courts. Prices can be a little on the high side, but you definitely get what you pay for. Good courts that are sheltered completely and comes with showering facilities as well. Will frequent this place and the coaches here are really friendly! Strongly recommend Coach Rocky! :)",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109376481746622916696/reviews
