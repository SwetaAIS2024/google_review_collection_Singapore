First time seeing this stall located right at the cross street in front of bierhaus.\n\nIt’s been sold by a foreign lady as she don’t really understand when I was speaking with her. Probably someone hire her to sell there. Anywhere the muah chee was soft and the peanuts generous. One packet for 5 ringgit seems reasonable.",
