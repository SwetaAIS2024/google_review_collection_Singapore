Robert Chai,5,"Dropped by this place on a heavily rainy afternoon and was pretty amazed that this is a pretty huge Harryâ€™s outlet which has great high ceilings and a bright and airy ambience.

Came out for a lunch and was pleasantly surprised it was not too crowded. Service staff was top notch as they kept checking back on my table and were all very friendly!

Will definitely come back again if Iâ€™m near the area & hopefully it would not be too crowded!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101775319044798524953/reviews
Di Franklin,5,"We have thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon drinks and snacks at Harryâ€™s Bar + Dining, Marina Bay Financial Centre. We had beautiful staff looking after us and the atmosphere was lovely. Can recommend the chicken wings and nachos for eating. 500ml of Tiger beer went down well after lots of walking and Prosecco was equally refreshing. A must visit place.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118188333362359406077/reviews
