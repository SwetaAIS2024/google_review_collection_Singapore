F Ng,1,"Not gracious at all - noise and air pollution to residents living nearby. Outdoor activities with blasting speakers of karaoke / getai, auctions, chanting and gongs banging (sometimes, at the same time) from evening till after 10.30pm!! Loud shouts of ""Yum Seng"" & ""Huat Ah"" make us wonder if it is also a night-club ... serving alcohol?

Hope the temple leaders will be more
considerate and let the residents live in a peaceful, respectful environment. We have been tolerant but find it very difficult to keep suffering in silence.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112164183611012027255/reviews
Claridge Goh,4,"I went there on the  5 Mar 2017 (Jingzhe @ 1733 hrs) to pray Hu Yeh
as my Chinese zodiac clash (snake 41 yrs). It has a comprehensive temporary set-up (behind) the original temple built-up. I suppose its meant for praying Tai Sui and Hu Yeah season only. Anyway there is quite a following of people there praying Hu Yeh (White Tiger) against misfortunes etc.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117652129885634707957/reviews
