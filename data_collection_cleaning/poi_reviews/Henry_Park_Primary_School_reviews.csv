Samuel Wong Jun Xian (Nhhs),3,"I am an alumni from Henry Park. It has a great school layout and outings. Canteen is big and spacious and have a lot of affordable food. However, in p5 I was in the gym and broke my finger. When my father came to the school, he consulted the general office about my condition. However, the staff members acted too nonchalant about the situation and said to go the a hospital. When my father asked my P.E. teacher where I was, she simply said that she didn't know and had a lot of children to take care of. apart from this, the other teachers are very caring, just not that P.E teacher.üëéüëé",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105483010748929383992/reviews
King bacon 24th,3,"Good food, recommend western stall and Muslim stalls( Both are good) school teachers are fine not the best but good enough.( in my opinion) Favourite teacher was Mrs David as she was very nice. First 2 years were fine but honestly every year that was hell. Very boring . Would recommend for your kids. Do a lot of exam paper In prep for psle.

My least favourite teacher is mdm Ong. However, I got through the 6 years fine so would still recommend this school",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105850135342883606077/reviews
soph,3,"my 6 years in henry park primary school were like riding a bike except the bike was on fire and everything was on fire because i was in hell. as part of the most recent batch of graduates, i think that my insight into this school‚Äôs situation would be valuable for any parents wanting to send their children here.

firstly, the teachers all either had anger issues or could not teach. in this case my science teacher was both because she would always spend half the class scolding us about our poor performance on the worksheet and then turn around and complain about how we had such little time left. maybe if you spent your valuable time actually educating us instead of chastising us our performance would have been better?? just a suggestion though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the worst instance of this was when she got so angry that she stomped out of the class halfway through and sent some poor kid from the other class to inform us of her current whereabouts. (she expected us to go after her, mind you) of course no one wanted to go and chase after her because i think we would all be better off without somebody none of us could stand, but since the head prefect was in our class he made us go and chase after her. once we actually got to the lift lobby she got even angrier and told all of us except the assistant head prefect to go back to class since ‚Äúhe was the only one who had the dignity to apologize‚Äù?? you signed up for this idk why ur getting so angry. look i understand wanting the audience to give you your due respect when ur talking but you literally threw a whole adult tantrum over a bunch of 12 year old children.

my english teacher probably had a vendetta against me because of a certain incident i will not talk about, but since i was good at the subject she did not have a reason to pick on me. she was good at teaching us, but not a good teacher because she played favorites, which is not inherently bad but she also played least favourites. these unlucky students would always get picked on because of silly things like handwriting, but honestly i don‚Äôt think she really cared about handwriting, she just hated them for existing.

this is not the only instance of the school failing to take the proper steps for their students well-being, as in my class only, there was 1 kid who tried to jump off the 7th floor staircase and another who lied their way out of counselling which they definitely needed. after PSLE, the boys in my class would also congregate and watch literal pornography at one of their houses???

speaking of PSLE, this school is also really really competitive. i don‚Äôt know if this was because i was in a GEP class, but everyone around me was perpetually comparing themselves to everyone else. there was this time where one guy in my class broke down because he got an al2 instead of al1 for his prelim so that was kinda weird. it was literally so competitive in there so if your kid will thrive in there, great! if your kid does not do well in a competitive environment please do not send your child here. also the prefects in my school literally were so immature and did not do anything ever. now that i am in secondary school with a functioning student council i realise that the prefectorial board was lowkey full of bums, especially the head prefect who was way more interested in hating gay people than doing his job.

overall 5/10 school, the teachers probably hated all of us and never wanted to be here (case and point all the good teachers resigning this year) and the students are just really mentally unwell. would not recommend unless ur a really big fan of academic rival romance and hating yourself.

p.s someone peed in the 6th floor girls toilet..",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100232710507355499346/reviews
Brandon Boh,5,"A Truly Great Experience at henry park

I can't speak highly enough of my time at Henry park. From the moment I stepped onto campus, I felt welcomed by both the staff and the students. The teachers are passionate about what they do and genuinely care about helping students succeed. They go above and beyond to make sure you understand the material and always encourage critical thinking and creativity.

The facilities are top-notch, and the campus itself is beautiful, offering plenty of spaces for studying, socializing, or just relaxing between classes. There‚Äôs a wide range of extracurricular activities, from sports teams to clubs, ensuring that there‚Äôs something for everyone to get involved in.

What really stood out to me was the sense of community. It‚Äôs clear that the school fosters an environment of inclusivity and support, and I always felt like I was part of something bigger than just my own educational experience. I also appreciated how the administration is approachable and really listens to student feedback, which makes a huge difference in creating a positive atmosphere.

Overall, henry park provided me with not only a solid academic foundation but also valuable life experiences. I truly enjoyed my time here and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a well-rounded and supportive school environment.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112007264804615917234/reviews
Hoyein Cai Heyan (Rafflesinst),3,"One of the best primary schools in SG and strong in their sports CCAs. Moreover, mainstream/GEP students get to go on many many learning journeys when they are P5/P6. The teachers are alright. The only thing is that recess time might not be long enough and the teachers sometimes night have unrealistic expectations of punctuality.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114165416317122556647/reviews
