sam Mariella,4,"Always have queue here. The crew works efficiently, so the food will arrive not long.

We like the Kaya Toast, and Peanut Toast. The tea is too acidic. Color of the tea isn't clear enough.

Overall is oke.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107208136672624210336/reviews

Pierre Valentin,5,I go to a lot of toast box in Singapore a lot. Every day more or less. And this one is the best. It is crowded for a reason. Coffees and toasts are good. Service is the most efficient and fast I have come across. Staff has my order keyed in before I open my mouth. I don’t understand negative reviews where they expect more than that. It is not the place to chit chat with the barista. They don’t have the time for that. And it is not what you are looking for in this kind of place. Great job.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118078402080936679031/reviews
Kai Ting,5,"Queue was long during morning peak but it moved very fast. The staffs were all really fast in serving. While I was there sitting for a good 1.5 hour, the queue continued to be so long.

I’ve always liked Toast Box coffee. Was there to enjoy my free Kaya Toast set as I recently bought the “80 Cups for $126” promo, and it came with 2 complimentary sets of Kaya Toast (with eggs and drinks). Extremely value for money.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106075578632232417727/reviews
Vincent Li,1,"The female staff at Toast Box Marina Bay link mall had a very bad attitude and showed impatience towards us.
First of all, the displayed menu of fried tang hoon set was wrong. We asked about it and the staff didn’t explain at all. She later on impatiently just asked us to “just order!”
This is very bad service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107184831837861463481/reviews
