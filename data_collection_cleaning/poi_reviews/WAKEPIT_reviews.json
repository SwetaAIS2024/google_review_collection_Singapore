They guided us through the proper techniques and corrected us as and when needed.\n\nWe were entirely new to foiling and surfing when we started, but now we can confidently foil and surf without holding on to the rope.\n\nI always look forward to my session with them, and I will let you in on a secret..... They have a super cute dog onboard with them (most of the time)! You know where to go if you are a dog-lover and want a great time on the water! :D",

Personally, I'm still trying the gasp the improvements that I've made so far in a matter of a fornight!\n\nWent for a 4 personal sessions, two hours each. Under the watchful eyes and immense guidance of Frankie and Ping they gave me tips and guided me through even run that I made, encouraged me with every fall that I made.\n\nFrankie and Ping are champions in their various divisions. So how not to improve learning from two champs?\n\nThe boat is a super luxurious and comfy one that can fit 8 pax with plenty of space and a large canopy that covers almost the full length of the boat!\n\nThe entire experience justifies the price one has to pay! Its is very beginner friendly as well. Highly recommend!",

With them, I see myself improving every session rather than just simply having some fun in the water!\n\nI find myself excited for the next session after every one and that‚Äôs testament to the work they put ü§òüèº Always always a joy to wakesurf with them ü§ç\n\nBonus points if you love dogs!! Thank you butter for being our constant lifeguard on duty!",
