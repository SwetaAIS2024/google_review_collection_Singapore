edwin,4,"Ordered the tonkotsu ramen, but it tasted quite different from typical tonkotsu – more like a light shio broth, but still not quite that either. My Japanese girlfriend called it “original Singapore ramen,” which might be the best way to describe it. The taste is still pretty good, and at $8 it’s solid value – comes with all the essentials like meat, egg, seaweed, and noodles. Don’t expect Hakata-style richness, but if you frame it as SG hawker-style ramen, it hits the spot.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109891667258604967057/reviews

- Difficult to find tables during lunchtime.

- Parking is challenging with small lots and limited lots per floor. It's also ends up more expensive than the typical  HDB carpark due to the per-hour charging model.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103854866816776797/reviews
是无名,5,"Super! Must try! I am sure going to be back!

Amazing and for reasonable price.

Food... yummy! I love the rich soup base of the ramen. Tried the black garlic soup base,  yum! The white base is equally good!!!  The portion is good,  more than enough! The pork slices are just too good! The onsen eggs are so good. Had items 12 and 17. Going to try others next time.

Definitely a must try if you are at this place.

There's free noodles upsize. There's also more affordable lunch sets.  So check out the menu.

Owner is patient and quick.

Stall is right at a corner,  be warn that weekend can be busy. There's a nice space right in front of stall.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105456352515293598037/reviews
Lionel,5,"Ordered:
- 1 x Special Tonkotsu Ramen
- 1 x Red Tonkotsu Ramen + Osen Egg

Total: $15.70

The broth was rich and flavorful, perfectly complemented by the crisply fried meat. At such an economical price, it's no surprise this place is highly rated.
