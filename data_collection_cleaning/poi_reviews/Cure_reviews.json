Each course was tasty, and it was fun discovering modern classy interpretations of some Irish food. I'm just sorry it took me so many years to finally give this place a try. I will definitely be back.",

Service was good, would enjoyed it more if the beautiful plates and decorations were not cleared up so quick haha.

The staff noted it was my husbandâ€™s birthday and gave a little something which was thoughtful and useful - a little goodie bag comprising samplers of Irish cream, the very same bacon butter that came with the soda bread in the menu, and a useful fridge magnet with the recipe of the said bread. Such a nice way to remember the meal by!",
