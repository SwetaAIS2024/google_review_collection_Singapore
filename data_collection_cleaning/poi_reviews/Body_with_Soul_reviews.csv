Rajeev Kapoor,1,"Should not even be awarding them 1 star but that’s the minimum you can give here. Absolutely no ethics and no regard for therapy. Money spinners. Very bad experience. Don’t waste your time with Ms Shrimathi Swaminathan, who also happened to be the owner earlier of this place. It’s not even worth my time putting here my family’s personal experiences with them. Rank down hopeless. Used to be at Rochester earlier.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107387346385497049848/reviews
