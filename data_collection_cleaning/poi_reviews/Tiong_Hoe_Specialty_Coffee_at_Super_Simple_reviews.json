Will def drop by again",

However, the flavour wasnâ€™t as good as their Super Seven blend of Mexico Guadelupe Zaju and Colombia Tablon de Gomez, which was available in an earlier visit. The cup of Super Seven had good aroma and a robust, balanced, fruity flavour with a medium body, good texture, and a rum aftertaste. Uses Meiji milk.",
