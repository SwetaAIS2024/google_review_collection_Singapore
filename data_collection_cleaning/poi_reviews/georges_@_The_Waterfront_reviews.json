We went on Friday night so there was live band, and although we sat outside the music was still very loud. A little hard to talk, but it's fine since the music was nice",

Service from Asst Manager Red was excellent, so was the other lady who served us. We have 4 kids and Red was so patient with us and going the extra mile when she realised we had a cake to celebrate my son's birthday.\n\nFood choices was aplenty and reasonably priced. I would definitely choose to eat at Georges again! Thank you!",
