They have several meat options that looked good & decided to fill my container with some of the proteins.\n\nOrdered extra spicy for mine & about 10 mins my order was ready. Returned for additional chilies when realised it could be more spicier. With a smile the cook acknowledged & Stir-fried  additional chilies for my order. The  seasonings were alright, n their prices are higher than serval of the nearby mala xiangguo.",

Could not finish it as it was so spicy. Drink water until full already.\n\nI like that they cut their ingredients very thinly! Especially the pig intestine and beef. Intestine was not tough to chew. Beef was nice and tender, surprisingly.\n\nWill order again!",
