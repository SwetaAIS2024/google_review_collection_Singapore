Ashton,1,"I recently visited this place, and I have to say it was a huge disappointment. The pizza was frozen, not fresh, and lacked any flavor or quality you’d expect at such high prices. To make matters worse, it wasn’t just the pizza—everything seemed to be frozen food passed off as fresh, and the prices were outrageous for what we got. If I’m paying premium prices, I expect fresh, quality food, not reheated frozen meals. Definitely not worth it, and I won’t be coming back.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113977038662710298684/reviews
Bjorn Ong,1,The American classic pizza taste like the frozen ones that can be bought from the supermarket. The pasta is tasteless and underwhelming. The beef fries are over cooked and the shredded beef was just dumped on top of it.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118079996676711640693/reviews
Vishalini K,5,"There were so many unique options to choose from! The owner was pleasant and patient, explaining and recommending a few options based on our preferences. We settled on their What é Duck pizza, which was Chef's Kiss combined with red wine! It was delicious and flavorful. A perfect meal to share with friends and family on a chil day. Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102303850799134902095/reviews
Si Hua Chin,1,"something that takes only 2 mins prep ended up becoming a 20mins wait.

after ordering, i waited at my table with the beeper for approximately 15mins. it came to me as weird since there wasn’t any other customers at all. when i went back to the stall, the staff was on the phone chatting away. and when i asked about my order again, that’s when he started prepping it.

never returning to this stall again. food is meh anyway. all he took was 2mins. what do u expect",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117948102396840802515/reviews
