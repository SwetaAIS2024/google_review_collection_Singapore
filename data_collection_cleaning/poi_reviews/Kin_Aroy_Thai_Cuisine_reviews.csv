PEI TING,1,"I recently visited this stall and tried their Tom Yum Chicken Soup. While the Tom Yum broth was quite flavorful and delicious, the chicken was unfortunately very tough and hard to chew, making it difficult to enjoy. The soup itself was good, but it was a bit lacking in variety – it only had chicken and a couple of slices of mushrooms. I ended up just eating the rice and drinking the soup because the chicken was really hard to swallow.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116863530639273098460/reviews
Pang Thitaporn,1,"Never wanted to give a bad review to any shop but this one I really can not take it. As Thai, the papaya salad should be more spicy. I really disappointed with the fried chicken. It was terrible experience. It should be the easiest dish but you still can cook it properly. The starch wasn't blended properly on the chicken and it's very oily like no crispy just oily. It's my first time that I couldn't finish the fried chicken. Really disappointed",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105542275816654541901/reviews
