Aliah Shamshuri,1,"Attention coolblog manager, I went to coolblog yesterday and ordered a strawberry cheese smoothie. u have a coolblog staff (indian girl) she doesn't even blend the water even though in the picture it is blended. I said to him, 'why don't you blend', while showing the picture of the water, but he said that you don't need to blend, you have to order the Oreo smoothie. I'm like whaat?. Although before this I bought it from another cool blog, it's nice that they serve blended water and that's my favorite water.  It's even called a smoothie.  I'm too lazy to argue with him, blah. Maybe it's trivial, but you have staff who don't want to work. I pay for the price yes but he did something wrong and won't admit it. Hire staff who are good at work please.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106788890883824325884/reviews
Nabil,4,"✅ coolblog cashier is very friendly and good customer service
❌Strawberry smoothies are less sweet. But go to coolblog anyway. Sometimes it's ok, sometimes it's less sweet. I don't want it to be less sweet. Is there no standard measure to maintain the taste?
❌ Stop taking orders at 9 o'clock",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117629276663037471847/reviews
