Elizabeth Novena. He took time to understand my medical history and answered all my queries. Most importantly he communicated  everything so well. Our close contact who got operated by Dr. Hong recommended us to visit him and we can't thank him enough for directing us to the right doctor. Would highly recommend Dr. Hong to everyone.",

      "text": "The counter staff nurses are rude and unprofessional. Give me very bad experiences since my first visit dated in 2014. The young Chinese nurse was rude when I told her my IC number during my first visit. Instead of telling me nicely that she wanted my physical IC instead, she raised her voice at me. Upon payment, the young nurse didn't gave me a receipt and when I called to ask for it, she gave me excuse that she did gave me but I forgot to take. She said that she will give me in my next visit. But when I came for my next visit, she told me the receipt was not ready as Dr Ho haven't stamp and sign on it. She will mail it to me instead. Obviously, she didn't have any receipt for me from the start.\n\nThe third incident was when I called the clinic to enquire whether I can push forward my appointment date, the same young Chinese nurse who treated me badly since my first visit talked to me harshly over the phone and told me that the doctor won't be seeing me as my medical report was not ready yet and she started to raised her voice at me again until her other colleague took over the phone from her.\n\nOn my subsequent visits both Chinese nurses put a patient who came in after me to see the doctor first though I've already made advance appointment and I'm the very first patient in the queue.\nWhen I collected my medicine, the counter nurse gave excuse by instructing me to write the oral medicine instruction myself as she can't print out the words\" To be taken every alternative day\" from her computer.\n\nThe same young Chinese nurse even ignore me when I told her that I will leave my gym bag in the clinic while I go to the Ladies and there is no other patient around. She simply just glared at me and didn't respond to me at all. Didn't treat me any respect and manners at all.\n\nSince then, I stop seeing Dr Ho because of such lousy attitude I've received from the counter staffs. These are the first ever worst experiences which I've ever encounter so far from clinic staff/ nurses in my life. I've never encounter such bad experiences in any other clinics which I've visited so far in my life before. If their behavior don't improve, the clinic will only be losing patients.",
