      "text": "I visited D’Star Bistro recently and had an unpleasant experience at the counter. The cashier seemed more focused on her own tasks and asked me to wait, which I understood. However, when I approached to place my order, she unexpectedly mentioned \"pasta,\" which confused me, as I hadn’t brought it up. It felt like she was making assumptions about what I wanted without actually listening to me. She even began explaining what pasta is, as if I didn’t know — which came across as condescending and unnecessary. The overall interaction left me feeling dismissed and a bit awkward. I hope the service improves, as I’ve heard good things about the food.",
