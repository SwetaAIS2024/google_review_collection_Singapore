Emily Ho,3,The place was bright and clean with many powerpoints. Laksa was good but the portion was small. Braised pork rice was decent. The fried pork slices were crispy and delicious. The serving for ham and cheese toast was too small for the price paid; not worth it. Drinks were fine. Service was good.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106638367480970822498/reviews
Nigel,5,"Just had the Nan Ru Fried Crispy Pork Noodles and Iced Kumquat Tea and it was fantastic! The pork was perfectly crispy and flavorful, and the noodles were cooked just right. The kumquat tea was the perfect refreshing complement, not too sweet and very thirst-quenching.
The presentation was also lovely, as you can see from the photo.  Definitely recommend this place for a satisfying and delicious meal!  Looking forward to trying more of their menu.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102914900496794197818/reviews

Dennis Quek,5,"Just had an absolutely fantastic meal at 'Ah Bowl Den'! The Heh Heh Laksa was a revelation ‚Äì a rich, fragrant broth with just the right kick of spice, and those prawn cakes? Crispy on the outside, succulent within, they were utterly addictive. And the Cordero‚Äôs Flower Herbal Chicken Rice was the epitome of comfort food, so soothing and flavorful. What truly elevated the experience was the incredibly fast service and the warm, genuinely friendly staff. Every dish was served promptly, and with a smile. The food was not just flavorful, but truly comforting, like a warm hug in a bowl. I'm already dreaming of my next visit to 'Ah Bowl Den'!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107252537590700456920/reviews
Wee Han Tan,5,"Came here for lunch. Tried the cordyceps herbal chicken noodles and the Hakka crispy pork rice. Overall, food is good and feels healthy. Noodles could use a little bit more seasoning. Also got the set with ngoh hiang, but it's not worth it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113994885645615349944/reviews
