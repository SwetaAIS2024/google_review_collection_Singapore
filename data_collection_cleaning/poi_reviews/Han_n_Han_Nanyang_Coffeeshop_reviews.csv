Ken Tan,4,First time trying this cafe.  No aircon but with ceiling fans turning quite strong.   Got a set of peanut pancake + curry puff + teh @ $4.5.  Pancake taste fresh and good.  Curry puff was also filled with potatoes and small piece of egg.  Add on another crispy peanut pancake and another kaya pancake both taste good especially the crispy version.   Cheap and good breakfast.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100121205735734303463/reviews

Siong Meng,2,"Good to see nanyang coffee here but unfortunately the toast bread, only look toasted but not the taste. Good thing the sardine curry puff was pretty good. The potato and egg curry puff was sold out.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114075970380476081405/reviews
Ben Sia,5,"Nice cosy shop at Jurong East St 24 aka Yuhua Village. Serve traditional Nanyang coffee, tea and other drinks. They also have traditional peanut pancakes in thin or traditional forms. The peanut fillings are Mr Bean type. They also have coconut, red bean, cheese and kaya fillings.

Traditional hot drinks is not complete with half boil eggs or kaya toasts.

For waffle lovers, they sell waffles topped with ice cream of various favours.

For the peanut pancake and tea I ordered, it cost $2.60. The coffee or tea at the nearby hawker center is already selling for $1.30 and it's worth drinking from here.

The curry puffs were not available when I was here and hope to try another day.

Lunch time will be crowded and consider taking public transport as Yuhua Village parking is usually crowded.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106256605185450057490/reviews
pianized,3,"Crust of the puffs was done nicely but they could have used more fillings. Cold drinks (coffee and tea) were too diluted, frankly very bland. Min jiang kueh was quite nice. The interior was quite modern. Gelato waffles were available.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116018259600273925205/reviews
