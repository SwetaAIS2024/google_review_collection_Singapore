I would especially like to recommend Li Lao Shi, who has been teaching my son for the past three to four years. She goes the extra mile to ensure he gets the best possible experience from school. The school is well-organized, allowing teachers to follow students throughout their growth, except in cases where a teacher leaves.",

      "text": "A big thank you to all the wonderful teachers in Little Footprints @ Teban Gardens, especially to Li Lao Shi, Fu Lao Shi, He Lao Shi and Teacher Regina.  Fu Lao Shi taught my child and she was very kind and patient to her, when she was in PG - this takes a lot of effort and she never lost her temper. Li Lao Shi is a very caring mummy figure to my child since N1, and she is extremely encouraging and patient - there was once during an excursion, I observed how she was taking care of the young children but she was also making sure they were drinking enough water, kept them dry and doing what a mummy would do to care for their children - she takes care of them like they are her own. She goes out of her way and recognises the young children for their positive attitude and they love her just like my son does! Teacher Regina and He Lao Shi taught my girl from end of N1 until K2 - and she, together with the rest of her class, has blossomed under their dedication and care - they loved to perform, sing and dance, learnt to care for the elder, plant trees and fruits - just like how gardeners take such good care of their seedlings, the dedicated, hardworking (they stay until late and come back on Sats) and passionate teachers are the key to the success of the school. The teachers make an extra effort to connect with the children, and inform the parents on the children's progress. We're so blessed to have the very loving teachers taking care of our little ones - a big thank you again!",
