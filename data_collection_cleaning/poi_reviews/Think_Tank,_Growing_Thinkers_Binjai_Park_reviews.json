      "text": "Teachers and receptionist are very nice! Ms Samantha Kee and Ms Bellejoy Chan are the best teachers. They both taught me and improved my English! They teach all four subjects, English-Chinese-Math-Science. At P3, my English was quite average but when I joined at P4 with teacher BelleJoy, she improved my composition writing and when I felt like giving up, she encouraged me not to. For Ms Samantha Kee, I did 1-1 with her in P5, before I was with thinktank, I got 27/40 for my composition writing but after she taught me different ways to improve, I got at 32/40 during my P5 EYE! As of now, I am doing 2-1 with Ms Samantha Kee. They offer 1-1, 2-1 or group classes. There are many teachers who can help your child and improve their subjects! Thank you Thinktank!!",
