      "text": "Food was good enough for some bites along with drinks.\nDrinks are decent. The beer has enough foam, which is good enough for a beginner level drinker like me.\nCocktail was nicely presented as well. Flavour is balanced.\nThe services standard is not always consistent though. Sometimes good. Sometimes the waiter or waitress just couldnâ€™t notice the hands raised at different tables.",
