MH Tham,5,"Our go-to for oyster omelette and char kuey tiao delivery. Most of the time, food would arrive warm and flavourful. Omelette would be crispy and generous with succulent oysters while char kuey tiao would be dark and well fried. Black carrot cake was lacking in egg though, but compensates with generous portions. Probably would take a few years off your life if consumed frequently, but still recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112376174358198242550/reviews
Ghostguan Raoh,4,Enjoyed a delicious Fried Oyster Lunch at Fu! I've been a fan of their carrot cake for a while and decided to try the fried oysters this time. The oysters were large and perfectly cooked in a light batter. The generous amount of coriander and tangy chili sauce complemented the oysters perfectly.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104812295164703558163/reviews

CBP,4,"I was searching for good carrot cake around hougang and came here because of the good reviews.
Bought $3.50 small portion and the it's pretty big portion. Taste wise, black carrot cake not too sweet and good balance of savoury and fragrance of cai poh and egg.
My son had the white version and he said its  very good.
I like that carrot cake was not too minced up and retained its chunky blocks.
One of the best ones I ever tasted. Can eat!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103691610785974721152/reviews
