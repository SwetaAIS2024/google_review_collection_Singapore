      "text": "Went with wife, bro & sis in law. The beers prices are cheaper than most places at $48 per 8 bottles bucket during happy hour. Non happy hour price is $55, which is equally value for money.\n\nSpecial mention to the karaoke system (KOD) which has most of the latest songs. The mics and sound systems were impressive too.\n\nDidn‚Äôt order finger food this round but the menu looks good. Will try next time coz will definitely go back again. There‚Äôs a tasty steamboat just opposite the shop. And there‚Äôs free parking!!",

Last but not least, the beer buckets pricing are worth cheaper compared to similar outlets. Definitely a place worth going! Cheers",
