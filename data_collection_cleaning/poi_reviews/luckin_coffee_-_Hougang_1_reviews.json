      "text": "So I came here with my PRC wife Emily Xia to support her homegrown brand. I was pleasantly surprised at how good Luckin Coffee is compared to Starbucks.\n\nLuckin Coffee is as good, if not even better than its aforementioned rival in all aspects including app UX, quality of drinks, store ambience, etc.\n\nFor new app users, there is the $0.99 among other amazing promos.\n\nI highly recommend Luckin Coffee for all looking for good drinks and food to enjoy while socializing with their friends.\n\nEdit: Me and my wife Emily Xia Jing at Luckin Coffee again with the results of our ravenous hunger ðŸ˜º See 3rd photo",
