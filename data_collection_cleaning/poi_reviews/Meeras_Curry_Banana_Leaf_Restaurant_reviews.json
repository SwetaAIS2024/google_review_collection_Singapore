      "text": "If you're looking for an old school pratashop, the kind you used to go to after school, this is it. Rustic, tasty, great service. Got 1 plain prata, 1 egg prata, 1 vadai, 1 fried ball and an iced teh tarik.\n\nPratas were great; plain was crispy and fluffy, egg was soft, both not too oily. Don't expect Springleaf crispiness for the plain but that's probably not why you're here anyway. Vadai is on the softer side, lentil batter and not the overly fried kind trending nowadays; fragrant. Fried ball was a miss for me, I expected a banana ball but was greeted by a dough ball dipped in rose syrup. Insides were still undercooked too and a little gummy. Teh tarik was fantastic, the tea is so fragrant and the milk is nice and light from the pulls. Put some ice and you have a good day ahead of you.",
