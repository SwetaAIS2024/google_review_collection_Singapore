J,1,"The security and management is the only thing that lets this place down.  Great location with some good amenities including a 24/7 gym, but the security and premises team are rude and unhelpful when you have issues. I had difficulties with the carpark gantry and security only gave me a template response and completely ignored me when I followed up. Do not recommend",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110796334835030092038/reviews

vig,1,"Very bad management & unfriendly security. They have carpark lot in front the building but will never let you park, not even just pick up your food & go. Will also use cones to block the driveway to make it narrow. Your restaurant is on the street level. Why make your customers park on the road side for just pick up their order? Isn’t it you making us do illegal parking? This is really bad for the restaurants business.  For your customers convenient why can’t you let your customers just park at the carpark lot in front of your building & pick up their food? How long can it take?",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117785889969823785585/reviews
