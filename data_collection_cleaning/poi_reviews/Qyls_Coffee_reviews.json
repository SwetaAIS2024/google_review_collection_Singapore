Ordered a few times for my friends for gathering and the quality is always top notch. The tiramisu is also good. Finally something good in Hougang green :)",

The coffees served are always aromatic and you can ask for customisations too. My go-to coffee place when I’m in the area. There’s not much space to sit for dine-in options.",
