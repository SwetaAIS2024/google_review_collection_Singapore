Terry Chua,4,Nice chill out place. But wouldn’t specially make the trip down if you are not a resident or in the area. Food is nice but not that well seasoned and slightly overcooked. Place can be quite warm as is it outdoors and not in a breezy area.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114779419389907602398/reviews
Maria Lee-Phan,4,The ribeye steak is good at the price range! Chicken chop is good too. Nicely done! The truffle fries are good too. Alio olio is not bad too but just a tad too salty. Happy there’s good dining in our estate!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108308338482316312258/reviews
Michelle Teo,4,"Cute little condo cafe next to a pool with a chill ambience. Portions of meats are generous and taste is pretty good!

Steak was pretty decent, fried chicken wings were good. Pork chop rice was nice, portion of rice to meat could be a bit more though.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108661910545911493604/reviews
Limzy,5,Chill casual western dining option within a condo. Outdoor sheltered joint beside swimming pool at basement carpark level. Affordable pricing made cheaper with eatigo discount. Food is good value for money. Fries were superb. Do call in to check whether they are open and whether your preferred food item is available before going down. Can pay with credit card. 1 baby high chair available.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116700878853534773356/reviews
Brandon Kum,5,"I recently visited this cozy cafe by the pool, and it was a delightful experience! The atmosphere was incredibly relaxing and welcoming. The food was delicious, and the beer selection was impressive. It's the perfect spot to unwind and enjoy a meal. Highly recommended!

P.s. Popcorn Pork Belly is a MUST ORDER!!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111963499811166301944/reviews
