Beyond W,4,"Good fishball noodles in AMK & the owner handmade them. The owner has a video intro that was  installed in front of the stall.

This stall specialises in Malaysian style noodles, drenched with dark soy & lard. My go to noodles are the kolo mee & bee tai bak, they complimented the sauce well imo.
The texture of fishaballs were soft & bouncy, maybe a little firmer will be even better. Must ask for more chilies which paired well with the noodles.

Queued for ard 45mins for my orders. Sold out before 12pm.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103234119696862881583/reviews
Matthew Lee,3,"I have bookmarked this place for very long finally decided to pay a visit and try hearing how good it was.
Visited on a weekday morning, arrived at about 1030am and there was still a queue. Queued for it and took about 20 minutes to get my noodles. Decided to get the big one for 6.50 and looking at the portion it was pretty big.
The main thing I liked about it has to be the noodles which are soaked in black sauce. This is Malaysian style and i preferred this over the chilli/tomato sauce. They were pretty generous looking at the amount of pork lard they gave. I gave it a good stir and I have to say the noodles were really really good.
Next I tried the fishballs. Of all the items in the soup, I liked the fish cake the most. The fishballs were okay didnt turn out to be up to expectations and special mention was the filling inside the beancurd which I thought was quite good too.
I felt the noodles were better than the fishballs and I would pay the price for the noodles. This time round the main ingredients turned out to be more of a supplement instead and didn't wow me.
Still worth a try, judge it for yourself and see because it's a personal preference thing.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109397825257995094119/reviews
MH & El,5,"[AMK EATS] 🍜⚪️ Hearty breakfast on a rest day at Malaysian Hup Kee Fishball Noodle 合记鱼丸! Their opening time is until 12 pm but they were sold out by 11.20 am (was one of the last few lucky customers to get my share of their 𝐃𝐫𝐲 𝐍𝐨𝐨𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐒𝐞𝐭 (𝐋 𝐬𝐢𝐳𝐞))!

Noodles are cooked to the right texture and generously adorned with black sauce, minced meat, shallot oil and belachan chilli. Stylewise it feels a bit like Malaysian-style dry noodles rather than the usual ketchup/vinegar version in most fishball noodles. The chilli wasn’t overwhelmingly spicy but delivered enough punch to add to the savoury sauce mix. And ngl, the aroma from the heap of crisp pork lard really 𝘩𝘪𝘵𝘴 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘢𝘣𝘴𝘰𝘭𝘶𝘵𝘦 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬😮‍💨

Handmade fishballs and fishcake deffo stood out with their taste and texture, different from the usual cookie-cutter ones you’d get from supermarkets! They are not as MSG-laden or bouncy but have a soft chew from the yellowtail meat. Tau pok with stuffed pork paste was decent, but I prefer their fishballs!

C S,5,"Be prepared for a 30-40 minute wait, but trust me, it's worth it!😋😋😋  Came at 10am hoping for a shorter queue🤣  This hidden gem near Mayflower MRT serves exceptional fishball noodles. The dry mee pok is topped with crispy golden pork lard, plentiful minced pork, and a generous scoop of special XO-style chili. Bite into the pork lard...u will love the crunch and sinful burst! The savory sweet sauce brings everything in the bowl together. 🍜 👍👍👍

Their handmade fishballs are springy and cooked to perfection, served with deliciously cooked mee pok noodles. Don't forget to try their fishcakes, fishball-filled taupok, and special tangy chili sauce with hints of lime.💯 We ordered  extra fishcakes and taupok soaked  in an incredibly flavorful soup. 😃

I'll be back to try their mee kia and mee tai mak soon.😀",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112962032943632041409/reviews
