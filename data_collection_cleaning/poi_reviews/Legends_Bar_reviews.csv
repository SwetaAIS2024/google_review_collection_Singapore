Yuxi Chew,4,Came here for a chill night of drinks and music. Really enjoyed the live band! Didn’t really enjoy the cocktails. Perhaps we didn’t order the right ones. Should have gone with red wine during their happy hour instead. Ambience is fantastic.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102992353237592493946/reviews
James Chie,3,"The food is pretty good here, even better than the buffet next door.  What’s really not great is the service, but we’re in Singapore so this is not a surprise here.  But even for Singapore it’s below average..  and as I write this I asked when the pizza was coming, and the server just looked ABSOLUTELY CLUELESS..",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104898669588373175636/reviews
Dennis N,4,"Painfully slow service, food and drinks was good. But perhaps they are understaffed.

We did enjoy the live band too which picked the songs from 80s-90s. Very chill vibes. Even though the service was slow at least they are clear when they serve the drinks to you.

We had a blast,but there can be a lot of room for improvement :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104988888938292694772/reviews
Eddie Lo,1,"The smell from the restaurant next door almost makes the bar smells like a kitchen, and therefore my cloths.  The Negroni feels like it was pre mixed, the glassware is Ikea quality.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114781422158641184565/reviews
