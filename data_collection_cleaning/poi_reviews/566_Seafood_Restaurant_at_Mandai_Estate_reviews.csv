ChokeMeDaddy,2,"The vibe of the place is very pleasant and relaxing. It takes me back to some of the restaurants in Xiamen.

However, I would like to highlight two concerns: the food and the toilet situation.

The food looks amazing, but that’s where it peaks. I wouldn’t say it tastes bad, but there’s nothing about it that justifies the extreme cost.

As for the toilet, while I’m not expecting a butler or sparkling tiles with elaborate decor, it barely felt like a proper washroom. It came across more like a cement stall with a toilet bowl. In my opinion, it could really use a good cleaning.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101464993610468052348/reviews

Diana R,5,"The restaurant doesn’t feel like Singapore, it feels like Malaysian Chinese restaurant with its rundown vibe, chill mood and spacious feel! I like the atmosphere.

The food is good too - especially the steamed prawn garlic vermicelli, pan fried kurobuta pork chop with honey, pumpkin sauce tofu. You can give the fried rice a miss.

The service is very friendly and fast too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102157818940506229707/reviews
Ann G,4,"Food were really good. Service was nice too. The place is rather rundown and old school, with karaoke system... Give us a different feel. The bill for 7 dishes for 7 pax was $215.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115140467541754927586/reviews
Wong Kuen siang,4,"Hidden in the industrial area and dormitory. Lots of car park. Once u enter the restaurant you will feel the space and the high ceiling. Love the space n high ceiling. Don’t have the exhaust fume smell from the kitchen after 1 hr of dining. Food is great. Service is prompt and food serving is fast. The lady is cautious n only recommend food quantity based on the headcount and will stop you from ordering too much. Roast duck is good, the kurobota pork chop is good. Also love the steam peanut and jambu with lemon peel
Served as appetiser. Value for money and totally a hidden gem. Need to have car transport or taxi to reach here.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114820514284428780545/reviews
