M Ash,5,"The place may not look like much and it does not have the ambience of the more popular seafood spots in Johor. But don't let the run down outlook fool you, as the food is superb and supremely affordable. My third time there and the place still doesn't disappoint. Worth at least a try.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100987989249033738315/reviews
Low Fai Ming,5,"Lovely quiet place to have dinner. Prices are very reasonable. 120RM for 2 sotong dishes, one steam fish, one egg, one vege and one soup. This feeds 5 people.

Order at the front where all the fresh seafood are.

Ideally, the ability to speak Malay would widen your menu choices.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112234939274584105815/reviews
zuhrin azam ahmad,5,"The service was fast. We had lobster, crabs and squids. The lobster deserves a special mention. Cooked with salted egg. Super delicious but one has to be the lucky one as the lobsters here are fresh from the nearby sea. Not frozen. Reasonably priced.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115127978309408573360/reviews
RIDHWAN SAID,5,"Pendas Floating Restaurant is a delightful dining experience located near Fisherman Village. The restaurant offers a unique floating ambience with stunning views of the estuary and surrounding mangrove environment. The menu features a variety of fresh seafood, including prawns, crabs, and fish, all prepared with rich spices and flavours. The price, depending on the menu selection and might be high if you take the lobster.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113173235596445751767/reviews
Simon Teo,4,"The seafood were fresh. Dishes were all flavorful. It’s a bit out of the way. Those taking Grab, pls note it’s difficult to get one for the return trip. Saw a couple stuck there with no ride back.
Highly recommended.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106054215453269284121/reviews
