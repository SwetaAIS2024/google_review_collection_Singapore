christian hacker,5,"you can spend hours just enjoying the diversity & beauty of nature in this surroundings. between 7-9 p.m. there's light & sound shows, which is quite impressive, too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113251929853076886846/reviews
Dinusha Deshapriya,5,Impressive!! You can watch the light show with different kind of music if you come to this place in night. And itâ€™s totally free !! I enjoyed a lot and it was bit crowded once i go there because itâ€™s a weekend. You can watch the light show in several view points. Definitely this a nice attraction you need to visit once you come to Singapore. Hopefully love to visit this place agin in a day time to have a different experience.

Peter,5,"My favourite attraction in Gardens By The Bay! Only $12 entrance fee and beautiful walk near at tree canopy level overlooking the Flyover, Marina Sands Bay and the park! Great place to take pictures and enjoy the view! The walk itself is not long, but you'll be outside, so it's probably good otherwise would be risking a heat stroke! Highly recommended to visit especially as a tourist!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117803073888288445568/reviews

Neil Brewster,5,"Great spot to watch the Supertree Grove light and music show. The spot we chose was almost full by 30 minutes before the show, between Christmas and New Years. We had a nice view of the Supertrees, with Marina Bay Sands framed in the background. The tree nearest us only lit up occasionally during the show, but we had a clear view of three main trees. Note: you'll be sitting on lumpy rocks, so you may want to plan ahead and bring something soft to put under your bum!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116268873436915161383/reviews
