      "text": "We have been with learning vision for 7 years!\nLV CBP has been an amazing place for my children!\nThe teachers are patient, attentive, and truly passionate about what they do. So you won’t experience changing of teachers often.\nPrincipal, VP, staff admins and teachers always go the extra mile to make parents feel involved.\n\nThe curriculums are well-structured, balancing learning and play in a way that keeps the kids engaged and excited.\nI’ve seen so much growth in my kids’ confidence and social skills since joining.\n\nAlso, the facility is clean, safe, and well-maintained. There is 0 outbreaks of any disease during our years here.\n\nI’m so grateful to have found this preschool and would highly recommend it to other families!",

      "text": "Visited many many preschool before deciding this center for my first born . It turn out to be one of the best choice i made in my parenting journey . The teachers have good rapport within parents , child and even among teachers. The curriculum is strong that my firstborn had no problem adjusting and keeping up when she enter primary school . They make sure that the children and parents are informed of every minor and major change . Yearly when the children are promoted to the next level , current teachers will take lots of time to prepare , preempt the children of the changes ahead, making sure that they are informed , ready and looking forward .\n\nTeachers are very dedicated . They deal with parents anxiety , concern and children safety with such thoughtfulness that you know that they truly care for your children . Principal Lai Peng is one principal that i have seen fiercely protect the interest of the children and builds a wonderful team . One of the good selfless principal u rarely see.\n\nCleanliness is also one thing to rave about in LV@CBP . They deal with every potential case with such determination to ensure there is no outbreak .\n\nOne giveaway if the center host happy children will be the level of chirpiness in the children when u visit the school . The kids is always chirpy with bright smile . This is drew me to the school in first place . You do not see kids stiffening up when the teacher enters the room . Instead they ran and hug the teacher . My second born is now in the school , she always tells me about her day in school , and its always with bright smile .\nShe always look forward to going to school .\n\nThis is one place that brings out the sunshine in children . good work LV@CBP !",
