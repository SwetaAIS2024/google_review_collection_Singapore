lamei,2,"I recently ordered takeaway and was quite disappointed with my experience. I specifically ordered a dish that included half boiled egg, but when I got home, I realized it was missing. This was a key part of the meal, and its absence significantly affected the taste and overall experience.

Attention to detail is important, especially for takeaway orders where customers canâ€™t check the food right away. I expected better quality control from a place with such good reviews.

I hope Sukiya can improve their order accuracy to avoid disappointing future customers.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107192851982219582115/reviews
Jeremy Chong,4,"Food: had the half boiled egg beef yakiniku bowl (M). Portion is just nice for me. The amount of beef is reasonable. The sauce is just nice, not overly sweet or salty. Minus one for the egg, I thought the egg would be served inside as per picture but you have to crack the egg (just nitpicking), would prefer the yolk to be more runny

Service: scanned QR code, didn't have to wait long for the meal to come. Side note: if you have to crack the egg, best if there were some wet tissues available (or similar), otherwise make sure you have extra tissues to clean your fingers

Atmosphere: came in alone, almost 8pm, got seated immediately at the counter when I queued. Place is brightly lit. Ample seats available. (Queue is forming now at 815pm)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107469174196949866035/reviews
Ryan Foo,5,"I'm really happy that Sukiya has opened here â€” it was my comfort food back in Japan, and having it nearby again is a treat. The portions are generous, and usually, a small size is enough for me. The hot matcha tea is excellent, and I typically alternate between that and miso soup. The meal setâ€™s salad is fresh and enjoyable, but the karaage tends to be served cold, which is a bit disappointing since it should ideally be hot.

If you're mindful of costs, Iâ€™d suggest skipping the meal set, but nothing beats a hearty bowl of gyudon. A special mention goes to the spring onion gyudonâ€”it's absolutely amazing.

When the store first opened, the service was quite fast. Lately, it has been a bit slower, likely because they're training new staff, so I donâ€™t mind too much. I usually visit slightly after lunch hours to avoid the crowd, which makes for a more relaxed dining experience.

Overall, I'm really glad Sukiya is here, and it remains a go-to spot whenever I crave a comforting bowl of gyudon.

KasperxP,1,"I recently tried two extremely mediocre dishes at Sukiya.
The first was the Beef Yakiniku Bowl with added Kimchi. According to the description, it features ""Thick grilled beef with sweet and savory yakiniku sauce on top of warm Japanese rice."" Unfortunately, it tasted more like high-sodium sauce beef served on low-grade Japanese rice. The serving of rice was pathetic, and the flavors were completely unbalanced.

The add-on Kimchi was a joke - a mere tablespoon for $3.
This was stinginess at its finest.

The Okra Gyudon with Dashi sauce and chicken was another letdown. The menu described it as ""Gyudon with sliced okra. The unique slime coming from okra which contains soluble fiber matches perfectly with our special sauce, giving it a refreshing aftertaste.""
However, the half-boiled egg was undercooked, with the whites still raw. This was part of the breakfast combination. The special sauce was non-existent, and the dish was bland with no signs of Dashi.
The chicken was also gamey.

Overall, I would not recommend Sukiya. The dishes lacked standards, balance of flavors, and skill.
It's a try-once-and-never-again experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114210666729042004471/reviews
Liau Yuan Wei,4,"I got the new Takoyaki sauce Beef Gyudon bowl set menu with vegetables and ice green tea for lunch. Feel the sauce too strong and make me full very fast. Service very fast and payment process very smooth, simply scan QR code on table to order from online menu and make payment via ApplePay",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101467908285337699109/reviews
