EQ Xavier,4,"I visited this stall for fishball mee, despite many other stores being open, and was glad I tried it in the morning. The stall is managed by an uncle and two ladies, one of whom appears to be in training. The noodle portion was generous, consisting of 5 large fish balls, and easily filled my stomach with at least 15 mouthfuls of noodles. As a big eater, I can confidently say that this serving size would satisfy anyone. While the taste was average, the atmosphere was wonderful and the staff were exceptionally polite. Overall, a pleasant experience.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533019712721928126/reviews
Rei Axl Ye,5,"We tried this with minimal expectations and were surprised by how good this is. Portion is ok, the price is reasonable for coffeeshop stalls. Chilli has a good kick, no vinegar but tastes savoury and enjoyable to the palate. Only down side is they close relative early, sold out by 1130am when I was there",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115827926540149694576/reviews
Akiko Chong,1,"Closed for weeks and finally opened.

I go to this stall for lor mee since it is only stall open in morning. But when it open, is managed by the uncle. The noodle and meat is getting lesser. It won't fill your stomach cos the noodle only about 3 mouthful. I am a small eater, if this don't fill my stomach, I don't think it is enough for anyone!
Will stop buying from here!
Better to get food from other stall  to fill my stomach and not here!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101338337976813889604/reviews
Chin lim chu,5,Finally reopen!!!!!! Heard that the stall owner took a break recently due to an injury. Hopefully all is well now. Had been eating it since secondary school with my family and the uncle there always know I want mee pok extra spicy and extra noodles. Standard remains the same and price is still relatively cheap compared to other places that sell the same dish with lesser aroma.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108702530048785861699/reviews
JP Bautista,3,"UPDATE: From 5 stars to 3 due to the store always being closed whenever I visit. It's a waste of time for me and it already happened 3x. This is not proper management of the store.

PREVIOUS REVIEW: A pleasant surprise. Tucked in a quiet neighborhood hawker/kopitiam spot so it is not a packed place but you won't miss this place with it's long queue of customers. Though you might get lucky during off-peak hours.

The Mushroom Fishball Noodle is superbly tasty and enjoyable. Perfect texture and mix of flavor. If there's anything I'll complain about then it's definitely the lack of meat and ingredients for a $4 meal. To some big appetite food goers, you might want an upgrade to $5 or $6 but not just on the noodle but also on the ingredient like fishball, mushroom, vegetables, or meat.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106132181362602172465/reviews
