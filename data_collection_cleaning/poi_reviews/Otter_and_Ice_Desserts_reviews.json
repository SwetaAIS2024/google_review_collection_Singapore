Ordered the Strawberry Banana Yoghurt smoothie‚Äîit‚Äôs creamy and sweet (I might ask if it‚Äôs possible to reduce the sugar level next time), and so reasonably priced at $5 a cup. Pleasant server too. Will be back to try other items on the menu, like Green Tea Latte and Signature Milk Tea. üç°",

      "text": "I love having a private moment eating ice cream, topped up with fruits & fruit juices!  Service is excellent when customers get served delicious, yummy desserts with a bright smile on a forward looking staff‚Äôs face.  Tried their coconut ice-cream the first time & that got me returning back to the stall for more - today I tried the mango ice-cream, topped up with honey dew & mango flavoured pearls & my favourite dragon fruit drink!  Yummy!! Enjoyed it to bits!!! Highly recommended place to chill out & have some juices for the health conscious & ice cream if u can spare having some extra calories in your diet like I did! üòã",

      "text": "It's my go-to juice and fruits shop when I am around Loyang. Their juice and fruits are priced at very reasonable prices. The ladyboss is also very hospitable and friendly. An example is I ordered an avocado coconut shake and it is at a very good value of $5 (it really is a large cup made from one whole coconut where she scoops out all the flesh for us and a lot of avocado), and a large papaya slice at a price of $1 (which really is a good price). I really love this place and on top of it, the ladyboss is really nice and makes my stay a very pleasant one.",
