Physio LIMB,5,"Staff here are nice!!! That's heaps more than can be spoken for other bowling centres! (not shaming anyone here but stating facts)

Lanes are kept oiled.
Balls decent
Place even looks hygienic
...and we don't get many pin issues, as we've dealt with in past from other places as well.

Thanks for helping to make our New Year Eve outing a nice n memorable one!!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102329567921127590261/reviews
Jun Rui,3,"Came on a sunday night with my friends and took up the unlimited rounds for 1hr (we have 5 pax). Lane often had maintenance issues(pit dark out/stuck) and when we asked to change, which the staff kindly did, the lane took exceptionally long to reset the pins(30s each time). We paid a total $73.9 for 5 pax which included socks and shoe rental. Overall clean and friendly staff albeit the not so pleasant experience.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110839264500798856986/reviews
kaiwen yeo,5,"We were lucky to have a lane on Friday night before the polling day. The older female colleague was definitely much friendlier and helpful, which we really appreciate as we have young kids bowling for the first time.
For people who are visiting for the first time, when the staff asks how many games? If you have 4pax, it‚Äôs a min. of 4 games. This mean each pax will play for 1 round. If you want to play 2 rounds each then it‚Äôs a total of 8.

Other than that, the facilities were good, staff was quick to assist us when the ball was stuck in the middle of the lane. We appreciate that a lot üôèüèª
Thank you for making it a great experience for the young kids.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110582380985384628414/reviews
Goh Phoebe,5,"Toilets and lanes are clean. Here on a weekend last minute and managed to get bowling lanes with a walk-in. People do cancel their reservations so just come down. Also bring your own chalk/ powder.
Nice vibe with kids, teenagers and elderly playing. Very friendly vibes!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105025019280262870270/reviews
