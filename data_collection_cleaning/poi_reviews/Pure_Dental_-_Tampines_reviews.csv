S S,5,"Dr Maxine has been attending me for years and her service is excellent. She is friendly  and provides good follow up service. I did my braces during covid period and have been faithfully going there for my routine dental care. Receptionist is also very responsive especially with last minute requests and providing reminders before appointments.Few years back, I recalled my mum fell and broke her tooth during her vacation and I contacted the clinic for help urgently and she attended to her as soon as she returned SG. Excellent service!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103151965310780734882/reviews
Elaine,5,"I've had really great experience at this dental clinic. The admin and nurses are always responsive, whether via call or chat, and they send timely reminders and follow-ups for any questions. Dr Amanda is exceptional - I've had several procedures with her, and she is always thorough, attentive, and detailed. I've had crowns done at other places previously, but her level of care and precision stands out.

She’s also wonderful with children! Both of my kids see her, and she’s extremely patient and kind. My 2-year-old has had some dental challenges and can be very loud, but Dr Amanda always ensures he’s safe and comfortable despite the struggles. He talks about Dr Amanda, and looks forward to gifts after each treatment, which is such a sweet touch.

I am very grateful and highly recommend Dr Amanda and her friendly team.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107018193026892299369/reviews
