      "text": "Disappointing experience.\n1/ Conflicting instructions given. When we were standing near the entrance, the security guard said ‚Äúthe queue is there‚Äù, asking us to queue for services.\nAt different points of the queue, TWO staff, that were checking with customers queuing about their needs, told us we just need to queue after knowing we need counter service. But when we reached the front, we were denied entrance. Evidently we were not the only ones facing the same problem as 2 other customers standing at the side agreed that the staff should inform all those queuing that the counter is actually closed.\n2/ Hostile customer service. When we reached the front, we were denied the queue number. While the lady in charge of giving queue numbers was nice enough to try to seek alternative, she also said ‚ÄúI am the one giving queue number‚Äù implying that what the other staff said were not accountable. The security guard said ‚Äúyou should have saw that the sign says the queue is closed‚Äù. But isn‚Äôt it intuitive to follow the instructions of the supposedly dependable bank staff rather than following a piece of paper displayed?\nWell looking at the reviews that date back months and even years, I guess nothing much is done to improve the poor customer service.",

However, I went for Tampines branch and they helped me to deal with my problem successfully within 30 minutes on the same day.

They took the time to climb the stair up n down just to explain everything clearly and made sure my 80 years old dad understood all the details.Their professionalism and efficiency made the entire process smooth and stress-free. And for bank manager Syai, she has a outstanding leadership. Her focus on customer satisfaction is evident in the way their team consistently goes above and beyond to help customers. Their effective leadership show the positive atmosphere and efficient service I always experience. Thank you very much. Jurong point branch.",
