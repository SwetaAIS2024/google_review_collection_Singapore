CK CK,5,"This is best braise duck and Kuay Chap in the region. $4.50 kuay chap one pax set is affordable and compared to others it has very nice aroma from the spices added. The braise pork belly, intestines, bean curd are all well braised to the right texture and flavor, I always add more bean curd so that I can enjoy more. The couple takes pride in their stall and food and are friendly in an old school kampung way. I always treat my friends to this when we are around the area. üëçüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116291332023390491227/reviews
Minako Ishibashi,5,"One of the best kway chap I had.
You can tell it's going to be good just by looking at it with the thick sauce, but it really doesn't disappoint you - nicely flavourful full of goodness, and all ingredients had great texture as well!
Generous portion with affordable price (2 pax adding duck gizzard was $10)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104583587557114685827/reviews

Shane Wang,4,The dark rice is good. Meat is tender and goes very well with the sauce. Their kuey zhup have also improved alot. It used to be salty and now it is just right and the intestines are cleaned properly.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109731227066204220826/reviews
Jason Eng,2,"Wife & myself ordered duck rice set + kway chap set.

Sorry I have to be frank on -3pts is due to:
1. Rice is abit hard. Not perfectly soft.
2. Duck meat is hard also. As though the duck died a painful death.
3. Soup broth don‚Äôt have the strong herbal aroma.

Have a try over at Sims market Hollywood duck. Then you will know where your standard is & improve further on your culinary.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112244911290965003801/reviews
