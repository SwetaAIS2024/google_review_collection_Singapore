Lam Nguyễn,5,"5 Stars – A Must-Visit for Okinawan Spirits Lovers!

Gobu-Gobu is one of those rare bars that leaves a lasting impression long after your first visit. Specializing in Okinawan spirits — from gin and rum to whiskey and sake — this bar is a celebration of craftsmanship, culture, and soul.

From the moment you step inside, you're met with a warm, welcoming atmosphere that feels both elevated and down-to-earth. The real magic, though, begins when you meet Rado, the bartender and owner. Rado isn't just pouring drinks — he's curating an experience. His deep knowledge of Okinawan spirits, combined with his infectious passion and easygoing energy, turns every glass into a story. Whether you're a spirit aficionado or just beginning your journey, he'll guide you through the menu with thoughtful recommendations tailored to your taste.

Every drink I tried was stunning — complex, smooth, and full of character. And with such high quality, the prices feel more than fair; they feel generous. It’s rare to find a place that balances excellence with accessibility so well.

Rado’s attention to detail doesn’t stop at the drinks. He genuinely cares about the people who walk through his door, creating an environment where you feel like a guest rather than a customer.

If you're in the mood for something authentic, soulful, and expertly crafted, Gobu-Gobu should be at the top of your list. I can’t wait to go back — this place is a true gem.

I’ll definitely be coming back. Highly recommended!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100173640615353744351/reviews

Masa N,5,"I came to the store after being invited by the friendly owner. All of the alcoholic beverages are unique and cannot be found at other restaurants in Singapore. Moreover, they are all reasonably priced and of high quality.

Although it is a bar, they also serve solid food such as quesadillas, chicken wings, curry rice, and cheese sticks, so it is recommended for a first party.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109860136814315990125/reviews
