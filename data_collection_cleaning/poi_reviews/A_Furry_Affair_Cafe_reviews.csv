Shermaine,5,"I recently visited this place with a friend who‚Äôs a regular, and she couldn‚Äôt stop praising it‚Äîand she was absolutely right!

My dog was a bit of a troublemaker during our visit üòÖ (almost knocked down a fence, diarrhoea-d on the floor, and even broke a plate and cup while moving around). Despite all this, the staff were incredibly kind and reassuring. They told me not to worry about the cost‚Äîeven though the plate looked quite expensive‚Äîand immediately checked to see if my dog was okay after the incident.

The food was fantastic for both humans and dogs! My dogs and I absolutely loved it. On top of that, they had a photo booth where we could take our own pictures and have them printed for free‚Äîa wonderful little touch.

The cafe also features a spacious area where dogs can run freely and interact with each other, which my pup thoroughly enjoyed.

Every detail in this cafe is so well thought out, from the friendly staff to the beautiful environment and even the adorable takeaway packaging for pets. To top it off, they even gave us a free gift! I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough‚Äîit‚Äôs truly a must-visit for all dog lovers!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111707977681136842852/reviews
ehs wol,4,"The staff were friendly and welcoming, which made us feel right at home.

The drinks and food for humans were acceptable, although a bit pricey.

However, the real highlight was the variety of food options for our fur kid!

We appreciated the spacious play area where our dog could socialize with others.

The separate baroque areas for dogs that don't get along were a thoughtful touch.

The cafe's cleanliness and safety impressed us - the area was spotless and odorless.

Overall, a great spot for dog owners to relax and socialize their pets. We'll be back!""",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106822197528181846448/reviews

illusorydoll Eileen,3,"The service was great, we had a really chill and quiet time. We love that the place was spacious and places that offers drink to our furbaby first is always a plus to the service.

Ham aglio olio $18ish. Requested for extra spicy and it turned out more peppery.
Beer battered fish & chips $21ish.
Food for humans was average, not worth the price in my opinion.

The meal for our pup was $14.80. Looks cute and he loves the meat and smoothie.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108751945590041472358/reviews
