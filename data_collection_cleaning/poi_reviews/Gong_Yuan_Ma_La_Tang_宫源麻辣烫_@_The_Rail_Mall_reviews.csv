Irene Lim,2,"Gong Yuan Ma La Tang offers a straightforward take on the popular Sichuan-style mala soup, but unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt quite hit the mark.

Soup & Ingredients

The broth was decent, carrying the expected numbing and spicy kick, but nothing particularly stood out. The ingredients were fresh, though the overall experience felt quite generic‚Äîcomparable to any other mala tang chain.

Condiments

The peanut sauce was a letdown. Instead of the rich, creamy nuttiness that enhances mala flavors, it was overly diluted and lacked depth. If you‚Äôre looking for that signature thick and fragrant peanut dip, this won‚Äôt satisfy.

Egg Bomb

This was a disappointment. It was excessively oily, which took away from the enjoyment. A good egg bomb should have a crisp yet slightly fluffy texture, but this one leaned too much on the greasy side.

Overall Verdict

Nothing fantastic. It‚Äôs an okay choice if you‚Äôre craving mala tang in the area, but there‚Äôs nothing particularly memorable about it. With better mala spots around Singapore, this wouldn‚Äôt be my top pick.

Abraham Lee,5,"New mala spot in the stretch, and it left a great impression‚Äîwe‚Äôll definitely be back! The interiors are bright and clean, and the food was overall good. However, the operational flow could use some improvement, as many customers (ourselves included) were new and needed guidance from the staff - especially with 1 ordering kiosk down out of 2. The process is simple: order at the kiosk, clip your receipt to your bowl, and wait for your number to be called when your food is ready. With a large variety of ingredients to choose from, it‚Äôs a fantastic addition to Rail Mall!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
Eddie,5,"It's yummy! The mala pork bone soup is nice can choose level of spiciness and pork bone soup is nice too. Can choose to fry or not for selected items. Staff is friendly to assist. One thing that shop can do is to add better blue UV light or mist at fridge so that can deter the flies to keep food fresher. Music speaker is not good as it gets very loud, can improve. Thank you. üòä",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109950273097709379120/reviews
AlexNicholas,2,"I rarely eat Mala but this outlet gives a bad impression on the food, I know the pork bone broth is supposed to taste rich and flavourful but this outlet tasted quite bland. this outlet ever since opened, been quite empty and usually only 2 staff is working there.

i ordered my food and was the only customer at the time, wanted my items to be fried. waited almost 20mins to receive my food in a dine-in bowl, which I ordered takeaway. the guy in the kitchen transferred to a takeaway box, hand it to me and I left not knowing the fried items is not inside, only realised when I was eating the food. so conclusion, food is bad and service is lousy, maggi also soggy....",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106023226129429339053/reviews
Alex Yang,2,"Review: Not Recommended
The quality of ingredients at this restaurant is disappointing. The bamboo shoots and pork skin had a noticeable bad smell, making them seem unfresh. The fried items were somewhat better since they were refried, but overall, the experience was poor. Won‚Äôt be coming back.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107330530381140598791/reviews
