Niraj Marfatia,4,"** Updated** Anext is going above and beyond to solve this issue. Kudos to them for their thorough follow up. Still upset about the outcome but that's more on the bene bank.

Totally struggling with a cross border payment to India (in USD) at the moment. The payment has been made about 5 times in the past and for some strange reason this one they decide to say there is an issue. Have taken the money out of my account, but have not paid the bene...What's up?!?!
Paying suppliers is key to ensuring a sound business relationship. This bank isn't helping right now....",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109983919727545072553/reviews
Marco Materazzi,1,"We are a Singaporean company - a small software developer - that applied for a basic business account. No loans, no credit lines, purely legit income coming from our US and Canadian customers and resellers. Anext Bank were considering our application for almost two weeks, they requested ""residence confirmation"" from all of our shareholders and directors and we provided them. And yet they refused opening us an account without explanation.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101051930221428400891/reviews
Edward Tan,1,"For business owner, if you are a start-up with minimal transactions, this digital bank may be something you can consider. But for established or business with medium to high volume of transactions, especially for cross border transactions, they will do a review of your company by asking for a lot of sensitive information. Waste of our time if you ask me. If you refuse/fail to provide or justify certain transactions without any proof, they will keep calling you and ask for it, and subsequently they may choose to close your account. I have since closed all my accounts with this digital bank and resume transactions with traditional banks...",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109150187558446768953/reviews
Suren Rastogi,5,One of the only banks in Singapore with a high interest rate. We have put some of our spare cash into Anext. Smooth experience to open the bank account and make transfers and payments so far.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107535244064903120092/reviews
Gavin McCloy,1,"I'm very concerned about data and requests about sensitive business data in detail. This goes totally against the PDPA, now threaten to cease banking services unless we hand it over. This is asking us to essentially break the law by handing over invoices and contacts between our business partnerships which is totally internal business information and confidential. Additionally they've a new clause change that they can share data held to 3rd parties! This is such a security concern! I hope they get thier legal processes and relations with business owners sorted especially legally. They should not be asking for such information nor sharing it to 3rd parties PERIOD.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110008419772794244770/reviews
