Edwin L,5,"Friendly and welcoming staff who without fail greet with a smile. While occasional order mixups can happen during peak hours, the team is quick to fix any issues and genuinely apologetic.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102451510872574509820/reviews
Di Di,5,"Very good and prompt service. I ordered in the app for self collection and it was ready by the time I reached, which was around ten minutes as stated in the app. The serviettes, chilli sauce and cultery were also in the bag ready for take-away.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
Ashley Liew,3,"Been coming to this KFC Kallang branch since a small kid decades ago so I am glad this place is still going strong. Service was good, the staff was really prompt helping to clear our tray just before I was about to clear it myself. Staff at the counter were doing their best tonight but for some reason not only did my order take very long to come, I also had to ask the staff to assist as it seemed my number was missed out; hence I ordered tonight 27/11/24 at 8.16pm but only could sit down with my order for only two people at 8.57pm, unfortunately my slowest experience here. The Tender Twister wrap quality was also a bit disappointing. But the fried chicken was on point as always üôèüèª",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Jess Chen,2,"Couldn‚Äôt get my order right, but staff exchanged the correct item eventually. However, there was hair in the lychee tart that my daughter found after she finished the whole thing.

jayden,3,"As busy as its always is in this standalone outlet especially during weekends.
Standard, quality and crispiness of chicken does have a significant drop in this outlet, many times piles of chicken can be seen in the cabinet tray area which does depends on your luck on the timing you order which mostly for me I do always get the chicken that's been left there for quite some time looking at the crispiness and soagy-ness of the chicken skin and meat.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
