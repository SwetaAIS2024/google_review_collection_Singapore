Teacher Zi has a great style of teaching.  His patience and motivation always make the kids willing to accept challenge and work hard.  During the past 4 years, we could see the kid’s rapid progress obviously.  Thanks to Teacher Zi and we feel so fortunate to have met him.",

It has been a fruitful journey e.g. Trinity College Drum Grade 8, a few international drum competition finalists, etc. Probably more important than these achievements, Zi has managed to keep my son interested in drumming over the years. For my son, Zi is both a teacher and a big brother.",

      "text": "Zi is incredibly patient, understanding, and accommodating. He structures his lessons based on the standards of his students. While he may be patient, he can be strict where necessary for his student’s growth. I contacted Zi for Percussion lessons at a point in time where I didn’t have the proper guidance to grow as a Percussionist. Within a span of 5 months, I was able to see improvements in my technical abilities thanks to the techniques that Zi has taught me. The advice and feedback that he provides on my playing every lesson has helped me approach my practice sessions in a more efficient manner. Despite being an outstanding professional musician, he remains humble and approachable, and is never reluctant to share his knowledge.",
