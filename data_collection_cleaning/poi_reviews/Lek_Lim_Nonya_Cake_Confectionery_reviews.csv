Jon Peng,3,"Saw the rating and was quite sceptical to try.

Shop is neighbourhood style and bare ID.

The ku chye Kueh (chive) is pretty good. Kueh is soft and filling is substantial. The chili sauce provided was not good. Suggest to eat on its own.

Peanut ang ku Kueh was soft and peanut filling has the right balance of salt and sugar, unlike some others where it is sweet.
Unfortunately they use synthetic paper as the base to steam rather than coconut / pandan leaves..",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112666739737001299012/reviews
Rezana Arthur,4,"There's good and bad..so good part first. Curry and sardine puffs are nice but quite expensive, $1.90 each. Putri salat also still nice, not too sweet. Plain Chee cheong fun is very nice and no weird smell! They sell 10 rolls in 1 pack. We unrolled it at home to add filling and steam abit. They never give sauce so we made our own too.

Bad part... Huge disappointed... Peng kueh & soon kueh there used to be very nice but now quality drop badly. Skin for both is super thick. Can microwave Abit to soften it but thick skin isn't nice, it's unbearable. Soon kueh filling is very bland, no taste. Fried yam cake is quite bland and the amount of yam have decreased, taste more flour now.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110728073357839343457/reviews
Emm,1,"Don’t know how to start writing this.

They use baking powder to make 白糖糕 which is very wrong. This is the worst 白糖糕 ever. 白糖糕 supposed to have 米香味, but this has nothing.

Glutinous rice is bland, tasteless, dry and hard. Is it that hard it is to make it better?

The soon kueh and ku chai kueh skin is so thick beyond belief. The filling is also tasteless and not delicious to a point I feel it’s a torture to go for 2nd bite. Is it just this batch of kueh has such standard? What happened to those 5 stars given by others?

It’s not about the money, it’s about you make consumer pay for non palatable food and end up the food goes to the dustbin. Waste money waste food. Not recommended.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104497351774938829570/reviews
J Lee,3,"Only tried the green bean Ang ku Kueh. The filling taste is ok, but the skin not so smooth. And the base leaf is plastic instead of real leaf, which do not have the leaf smell.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110830346229108740356/reviews
Choon T,4,"The kueh salat was disappointing. Fortunately, the curry puff made up for it. The fried yam cake wasn't too bad either.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114720035040328969753/reviews
