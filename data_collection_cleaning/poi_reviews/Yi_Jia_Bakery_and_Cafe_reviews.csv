Jacelyn,3,A bread shop with unique experience where they serve waffle on a plate with cutlery when dine in to eat the waffles instead of the traditional way take and eat. The waffle is cheaper than traditional waffle costs $1.50 for 2 slices with a few choices of filling. We opt for the peanut butter filling and kaya filling but size is smaller. Their peanut butter is those lava and thick texture which I like. However I feel the waffle have no flavour on it own and nothing special. Also order their honey lemon $3 and decent ok only. There also a lot of old school fruit tart and cakes at a reasonable price as well as kaya toast with eggs and kopi to go with.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111010667983647437264/reviews

Leon T,4,"Very heartland outlet at the ground floor of an HDB block. The whole area felt like a mini village imho.

it’s actually the first bakery I’ve seen so far that had dining tables (although only 3) outside to let customers enjoy freshly made waffles, toasted bread and hot drinks on site.

Food wise, it was simple but with a home cooked vibe. Prices way cheaper than all local cafe chains and you can pay with CDC vouchers too!

Will be back to try the waffles next time!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112055732544846425678/reviews
Camelia C,5,"Loved their waffles at thomson due to the kuehness n pandan flavor being subtle but present, tried it here at nearly half the price at thomson but this place doesnt do pandan & instead its ""vanilla"" based which was sweet n old school tasty,, love the belgian like shape and the affordability of the breads n variety..rum ball is cutes n tasty n cant go wrong at only 1.20sgd,

Ps mornings tend to be v crowded as people line for toasts n breads n coffee, if ur looking to dine (due to limited table space, ) come by after lunchtime or 1pm as the crowd dies a lil down and gurantee urself a seat! Also the aunties are friendly too",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111905760975157564192/reviews
