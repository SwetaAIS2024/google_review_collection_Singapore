Service was meticulous and patient (didn’t chase us out or hurry us even tho they have closed for lunch break. Thanks for accommodating us, Gabriel!) . Highly recommend this place ! Will be back for more!",

      "text": "Date night out and decided to go French at Les Bouchons Ann Siang.  Australian Rib Eye was great done medium and at 300gms size.  Confit de Canard was surprisingly dry and small although averagely edible.  Soupe l'ognion was good.  Spinach as a side was good too.  Atmosphere is remarkably typical to a bistrot in France.  Would go back again but hope the duck confit will improve!",

      "text": "Favourite place for a good steak and date night.\nSteak was mild seasoned, perfect when dipped with the blue cheese dressing, the black pepper sauce is good too.\n\nFries are not soggy and lightly salted only.\nGenerous portion for the meat. Bone marrow goes superb with the sea salt and toast. Nothing to complain about this place.\nEven the salad is crunchy, fresh and has a variety of ingredients in it. Staff are all friendly and service is top- tier. Keep up the amazing work!",

Served with fresh bread and real French butter.\n•Main: The côte de boeuf was tender, well-cooked, and full of flavor. Fries were crisp and satisfying.\n•Sides: Fresh greens and tomatoes brought good balance to the plate.\n•Dessert: The crème brûlée had the right texture and a solid caramel crust.\n•Team: The staff was friendly, helpful, and made the meal feel relaxed and personal.\n\nA great place for steak lovers or anyone who enjoys real French bistro food. I’ll return.",
