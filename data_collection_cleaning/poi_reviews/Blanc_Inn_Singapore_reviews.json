      "text": "The only downside of the hotel is it needs a better sound proofing‚Ä¶ noises can be heard easily if neighbouring rooms are moving/talking.\nI couldn‚Äôt use the ironing board as someone burnt their clothes and it left a mark. The hair dryer can be improved as it overheats easily and stopped working.\nSafe is available in the room, and the aircon fan temperature is just nice. The bed and pillow provided is cozy enough for a good sleep.\nI have to say the laundry price is too expensive lol 8 dollars for 15 pieces of clothing\nThe hotel is located near Bendemeer and Lavender MRT. Coming out from Lavender is just one straight line walk to the hotel.\nFor foreigners that want to go to a gym, there‚Äôs ActiveSG, a 3 min walk away from the hotel. It costs only 3.30 dollar per entry, but you have to bring your own towel.\nFood is not a problem as there are hawker/restaurants and bars nearby.",

The staff was also very warm and friendly, when I was doing check in, he also explained all the things we need to know about this hostel, as well as the area around the hostel. Even though the MRT station is quite far, the environment around is safe and comfortable for pedestrians. When I return to visit Singapore, this hostel will be my first choice for sure.",

      "text": "I recently stayed at Blanc Inn and was pleasantly surprised by my experience. I booked a room with a double bed and was pleased with the high ceiling, which made the room feel fresh and airy. The air-conditioning was also a great addition and kept the room cool during the hot days.\n\nThe staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating, making my stay even more enjoyable. The shower and resting areas were reasonably clean for the price and provided a comfortable place to relax after a long day of exploring.\n\nThe location of the hotel is in a quiet and safe area, providing a peaceful retreat from the bustling city. However, it's worth noting that the hotel is around 10 minutes away from the train station, which can be a bit hard to access if you're carrying heavy luggage. On the other hand, the area itself runs till late night, making it easy to grab a beer or two if you're in the mood.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at Blanc Inn and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and affordable stay in the area. The combination of a friendly staff, clean facilities, and convenient location make it a great choice for any traveler. In fact, I would definitely stay at Blanc Inn again on my next visit to the area.",
