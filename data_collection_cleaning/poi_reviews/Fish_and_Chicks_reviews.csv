Mohammad Roslan Bin Slamat,5,"Ordered the classic fish & chips and salted egg chicken & chips. Didn't take too long. Food was warm and crispy. Price was very reasonable. The atmosphere is a bit cramp because of the construction going on and blocking the pathway. Other than that, very satisfied and happy.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118407456789675707923/reviews
Alex,1,"ordered foodpanda yesterday Fish and Chicks Tampines Street 44. food arrived at 19:11 and consumed immediately
Chicken and fish were both sour. fish was flaky. my wife and i stopped consuming immediately and took some charcoal pills. reached out to foodpanda but all they offered was $2.5 voucher for food value of $24.4 which was unfair and insulting.

my experience was similar to Andrew's a week earlier

reported to sfa (see attached screenshot for case number)

also, bad review to foodpanda for its handling of the matter (see screenshots)",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113879601028806307115/reviews
Andrew Thian,1,"Was a patron 2 months prior, food was decent and filling. Today's dish was horrible, carbonara sauce looked like it was made of curdled cream, it was watery and wasn't thick enough to coat the pasta noodles.

Oh also, it's apparently ""truffle carbonara"", but there was barely a hint of it in the pasta. The grilled chicken didn't smell right and was rubbery, I suspect it might be really old. Couldn't bring myself to finish the chicken as the smell was making me lose my appetite.

Eating here before, I had come to expect the same quality and taste but I was sorely mistaken. Considering the hefty $10 price tag and the possiblity of an upset stomach, you can say I'll never eat here again.

Extremely disappointed, save your money, eat somewhere else. P.S if I get food poisoning, I'll update my review.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108632336433694498169/reviews
Farid Rahim,1,"Dined in. Ordered salted egg fried chicken and carbonara pasta. Wanted to add on rice, but they got no more rice. At 2:30pm, no rice?
Once the food was ready, it was mediocre but what really upsets me more was the carbonara as it was very very dry. Inedible.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114406587841324178832/reviews
Abdul,1,"Ordered via Deliveroo, and upon delivery, saw that my order received was completely wrong. Nonetheless, proceeded to attempt to eat the food as I was hungry by then, and the order took 66min to arrive. But the food was terrible. Fish was soggy & chicken felt sour, old and wet. Please avoid, not worth despite the hefty ongoing offers.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108265220873692735271/reviews
