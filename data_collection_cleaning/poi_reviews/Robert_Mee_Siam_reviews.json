The soup is the only element with flavor—a sweet and sour profile. The noodles are pre-made, and the egg is hard-boiled. While it may appeal to some for its simplicity, it didn’t quite work for me.",

Quite a rare sights for shops to only sell one item!\n\nDon't know why mine doesn't have taupok compared to the other Google review pictures... but there is a generous portion of Chives.\n\nBroth is light and tangy (lady boss squeezed the calamansi in for me) and not very flavourful like the ones in Muslim owned stores. Would say its towards the home-cooked food type of mee siam which is charming on its own.  And most importantly, the broth is piping hot which I love.",

This is not the typical Malay style mee Siam you'll find in most eating places. This is a version that is distinctively different. Less lemak or not lemak at all. This means no coconut milk.\nThe bee Hoon is nicely tossed and the egg is fresh. But the best has to be the gravy.\nGo try.",
