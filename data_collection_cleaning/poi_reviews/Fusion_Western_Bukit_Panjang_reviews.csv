Kerh Mai Ze,1,"Just went to have lunch just now, I wanted to see the menu but my hand was full and the menu was under an order. The staff saw i was struggling but did not help at all, she kept using her phone. After making payment she completely forgot my order and made me wait 15minutes before noticing. Not a single sorry was said and she went back to using her phone. Extremely poor attitude",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107747284488477449004/reviews

Ash Ash,1,"I ordered $12 spring chicken for take away on 8 Oct. They gave me 2 pieces of half spring chicken. Chicken was overcooked/refried. Size was extremely small. Meat was dry. Horrible. The worst chicken I had in my entire life. I rather buy NTUC roasted chicken. Fushion Western, please don't cheat your customers. Karma will hit back at you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107476653421719668747/reviews
