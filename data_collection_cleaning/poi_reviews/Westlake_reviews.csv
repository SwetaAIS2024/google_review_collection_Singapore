J S,4,"If you’re looking for a satisfying meal with authentic homemade flavors, Westlake is a must-visit. Some standout dishes include:

•	Roasted chicken: Tender and full of flavor.

•	Yang Chow fried rice: Loaded with ingredients and perfectly cooked.

•	Braised pork with pau: Their signature dish, definitely worth trying. I recommend opting for the regular version over the Iberico for a more tender experience. The pau is soft, and the pork is melt-in-your-mouth tender.

•	Prawn roll: Used to be crispy and delicious, but this time it didn’t quite meet expectations.

Popular with Japanese diners, Westlake’s reputation speaks for itself. With over 50 years of history, it remains a reliable spot for hearty, delicious Chinese cuisine. Located near Farrer Road MRT, it’s an easy go-to for anyone in the area. Highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107678637392727440177/reviews
Mabbel Elroy,4,"This restaurant has been around for many years and serves good food, though it tends to be a bit oily and salty, which may not be ideal for the elderly and young children.

Its location is quite unique—tucked under an HDB block, a setting that’s becoming increasingly rare in Singapore.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102879096020874056848/reviews

廖鈺權,5,"Westlake 西湖小吃 offers a casual dining experience with a no-frills approach, focusing on traditional flavors that are familiar and comforting. The setting is simple and straightforward, making it a good choice for those who prioritize the food over ambiance. However, it maybe a little uncomfortable sitting indoors when the restaurant is crowded as it is squeezy, and the sound ventilation isn't that good.

The **Braised Pork with Pau** is a satisfying dish with tender pork that’s rich and flavorful, paired with soft buns. While it’s enjoyable, it leans toward the traditional side without any surprising elements to make it stand out.

The **Yam Basket** is a classic crowd-pleaser, with a crispy exterior and a soft, creamy yam interior. It’s well-executed and enjoyable, though the filling might benefit from a more pronounced flavor to elevate the dish.

The **Prawn Roll** is crispy and flavorful, a reliable dish that delivers what you’d expect. It’s a pleasant addition to the meal but doesn’t stray far from the traditional preparation.

The **Yang Zhou Fried Rice** is a solid staple, with a good mix of ingredients that make it hearty and satisfying. It’s a dependable choice but might not leave a lasting impression compared to other menu items.

Westlake 西湖小吃 is a reliable spot for straightforward, familiar dishes. While the flavors are consistent, the meal is more about comfort and tradition than culinary innovation. A decent choice for a casual outing or nostalgic flavors.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113936687622194757252/reviews
