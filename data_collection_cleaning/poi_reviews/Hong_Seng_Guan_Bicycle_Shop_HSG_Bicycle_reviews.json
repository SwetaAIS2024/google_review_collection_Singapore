      "text": "Interesting experience. Went there, asked for help to fix up my barely used bike. Was assured it was a small issue and the boss uncle‚Äôs famous last words was ‚Äú‰∏çÁî®Èí±ÔºÅ‰Ω†ÁöÑÈóÆÈ¢òÂ∞±ÊòØÊàëÁöÑÈóÆÈ¢òÔºÅÂåÖÂú®ÊàëË∫´‰∏ä‚Äù„ÄÇüòØ He was very friendly and asked how I found his shop. I said I googled and saw some negative reviews but I trust the experience of experienced tradesman who knows what they are doing! I also declined the free offer and said I‚Äôd pay. Anyway I was told he needed time to assess the bike and fix it so I can come back the next day for collection.\n\nCue next day. Received a call and was told that the screw was secured poorly and he couldn‚Äôt open it. Claims parts were crooked and faulty and needed replacement. I asked for the price. ‚Äú$145‚Äù. ??? I was shocked to say the least and replied I‚Äôd dump the relatively cheap bike then. ‚ÄúOh then you give me the bike and leave it here lah, I slowly fix it‚Äù. üòí No uncle??? Why should I give you my barely used bike?\n\nI said no need to fix and went down to collect the bike. It was already placed outside the shop. Out of courtesy for his time, I walked into the shop to pass the uncle $15 as a token sum and he took the money, barely entertaining me. I walked out and collected my bike, only to notice that the brake cable was cut broken!!! What the hell.\n\nIn utter disbelief I turned to chatty to ask if it was salvageable. $5-10 for a replacement cable! üò§\n\nGoogled another bike repair shop (C**) a couple of streets away. Was quoted $40 to fix the bike. Collected it the next day. That was all I asked for when I took time to come here in the first place. For a fair quote for a proper job done.\n\nLooking at other reviews for this place, it‚Äôs either a hit or miss. If you enjoy some drama in your life, come at your own peril. üôÑ",

I was warmly welcome with a chatty uncle who accepted the kid bike brake issue.\n\nThis is considered as small job which most pro bike shop won't fix as it doesn't justify their man hours.\n\nThankful such services still being offered by bike repair uncles regardless quality of the bicycle.\n\nKid bike is fix with a minimal fee. Appreciate it.",
