The level 1 is modeled like a cafe setting.
There are some carpark lots.
It has a little pond with Jesus statue.

The church main service area is air conditioned. Most people know each other.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111128052716293687431/reviews

Durga Keshav,5,"Church of St Michael gives you the feeling of calmness. Very friendly office staffs that are accommodating and answers your queries quickly. The Catechism classes conducted for young catholics is awesome and it's fun as well. Love the sculptures within the church. Small carpark, hence you may want to park your car at the nearest HDB carpark instead during peak period.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114009071587580179937/reviews
