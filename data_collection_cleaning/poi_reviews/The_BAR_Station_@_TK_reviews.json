The sweet and sour stew coupled perfectly with the cheese+garlic bread combo. Had to mop every bit of the stew. The lamb is cooked to perfection, soft and tender. Every bite promises a burst of flavour in your mouth. Definitely a plus to chase away the Monday blues! Will return again to savour the Greek spread.",
