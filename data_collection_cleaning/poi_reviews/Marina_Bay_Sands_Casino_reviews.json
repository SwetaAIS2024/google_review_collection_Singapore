      "text": "Good casino experience for me. Quite an interesting place to spend money for entertainment (without having a goal to win money). I arrived at 11 AM and the place is already very crowded. The security check at entrance was strict, the Indian staff at the front was  not friendly. She tried to rush people in the line to show e-visa or everyone must go back to the line and queue up, as if she has KPI for head counts through turnstile. Once I walked in, I smelled the indoor smoking, pretty annoying for a non smoker like me. I went to exchange for chips. It is $25 each. I tried my luck at roulette tables and the dice game. There are free drinks counters at every corner. The second floor has electronic roulette machines too. Nothing much for non gambling tourists like me. Spent $200 in 2 hours. OK",

      "text": "The Marina Bay Sands Casino is a massive venue with a wide range of gaming options, from slot machines to table games like blackjack and roulette. However, the overall experience was somewhat disappointing. The staff often appeared bored and irritated, which detracted from the atmosphere.\n\nAdditionally, smoking is allowed inside the casino, which may be unpleasant for non-smokers. While it‚Äôs an impressive destination for avid casino players, it‚Äôs not a place I would visit again. That said, for gaming enthusiasts, it might still be worth experiencing.",

Very slow and rude security staff.\nNot enough clear instructions for tourists.\nNot enough staff at the rewards counter. Slow and inefficient staff.\nFree non-alcoholic drinks available.\nPlenty of table games. Limited variety of machines.",
