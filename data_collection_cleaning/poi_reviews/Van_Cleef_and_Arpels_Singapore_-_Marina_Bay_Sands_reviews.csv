Marc Rodriguez,5,"Every visit to the boutique has been a pleasant experience â€” each member of the team is warm, welcoming, and always professional. They've even accommodated a few special requests, which we of course appreciate.

Most recently, we worked with Ivan on a customised piece for my wife's birthday. He was thoughtful and responsive throughout, and managed to have it ready ahead of schedule. We're very grateful for his care and attention to detail.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110071303725121480492/reviews
Salva Mirza,5,"Visited Van Cleef & Arpels today to pick up a little something to mark a milestone. Was warmly greeted by the entire staff there. I want to make a special mention of Isaac who was very amicable, patient and understanding. He helped me browse through all the pieces in order to reach my piece of liking. His knowledge about the jewellery was also commendable! Thank you Isaac and Van Cleef Team at Marina Bay Sands!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115254903688385731425/reviews

Vanessa,5,"My experience at the MBS store was excellent.  We went there as a family member was interested in the iconic bracelet.  The staff there were so attentive and helpful.  They were serving other customers at the time and we were more than happy to wait, in the meantime all the other staff were so welcoming and friendly.  We didn't feel pressured at all and in fact we didn't end up buying as my family member was still indecisive.  However, I will not hesitate in going back to make a purchase in the future due to the wonderful customer service we experienced.  Thank you VCA staff!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117302407367458661640/reviews
