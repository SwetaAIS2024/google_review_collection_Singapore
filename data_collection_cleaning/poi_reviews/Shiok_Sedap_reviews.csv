LP Pua,5,"If you enjoy the peanut sauce found in Tahu Goreng, then this Mee Rebus will be delightful for you. The Mee Rebus, priced at $4, neither smelled nor looked like traditional Mee Rebus. Instead, it appeared to use a similar sauce to Tahu Goreng. Fortunately, I am fond of this sauce.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Á∫¢ÈºªÂ≠ê,2,"On the pricer side of the house.
Order bee Hoon/mee mixed, curry vege, egg, otah and potato cake come up to be $6.40. I did ask again if I hear wrongly with probably 1 otah considered a meat dish.
But yes $6.40.
Recommendations would be put pricing on the dishes to avoid misunderstanding.
Taste as per normal beehoon. Do see the stall properly b4 you visit.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108642313603766771661/reviews
Tan Lip Beng Zac,5,"Newly opened Nasi Padang stall at the list coffeeshop. Tried the turmeric rice, nice but I would prefer it to be not too soft. The curry chicken, Ayam penyat, beef rendang, begedail, fried taukwa with tempeh are all very good.

The pricing is reasonable. The curry chicken drumstick, begedail, fried taukwa with tempeh and turmeric rice comes up to $6.70.

Do give this place a try",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116800567453780575227/reviews
Roxanne Tan,5,"At a friend's recommendation, I went to this nasi padang stall at Dover Crescent. It's near to a bus stop which makes it easy to get there. Me and my BFF ordered 3 dishes each for our nasi padang. Love the tender beef rendang and succulent chili sotong. We also ordered two vegetables each - I liked the eggplant and the spinach. I find the bitter gourd a bit cooked for my taste (maybe I just like it a bit green) ... my BFF thought the sambal egg was a tad sweet for her taste bud - I guess everyone has different palate. üòÑüòÑüòÑ
Oh, we also bought kueh (yes, they sell nyonya kueh too) ...the sweetness of the kueh was just right ....and it's soft and chewy...",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114552897736854483962/reviews
Shawn Lourdusamy,1,"Came here for dinner at 6pm. Almost no dish choices. So I ordered nasi penyet. I must say, it was the worst penyet I have ever tasted. There was nothing penyet about it. Wasted calories!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114958040606541016371/reviews
