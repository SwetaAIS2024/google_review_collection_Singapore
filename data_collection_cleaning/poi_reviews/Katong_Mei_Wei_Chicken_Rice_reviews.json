      "text": "Came by for lunch just before noon. The stall name has changed, after checking on the web, it is the same stall that has been around for many years. Make your order on the right from the stall helper and collect your ticket. Listen for your number and collect your tray. Order the steam chicken, thigh, upsize.\n\nAlong with the chicken, you get a healthy serving of achar, and soup. The memory i had was much better than today. Rice is fluffy, but it lacks flavour. Chilli is not too spicy and well balanced. The unique part of this place for their chicken is they douse the chicken with fried garlic and the sauce. While the sauce is well done, the chicken has been cooked too soft for my liking, a little on the mushy side, not much bite to it. The soup has several additions in it, chicken feet, some pork pieces. I enjoyed the achar the most. Fresh and crunchy.",

      "text": "One of my go to chicken rice places. One of the top few in Singapore for sure. Not the very best but still highly recommended. Each meal comes with an either a cabbage or peanut soup that has been simmered for hours so it‚Äôs super homely and tasty. Their ah zhar is extremely fresh and appetizing too, by the way it‚Äôs refillable!! I prefer the roasted over steamed chicken and the soy sauce for the chicken is yummy too, and the fried garlic chips??? What a cherry on top. The fruit juice stall in that coffee shop is great too, give it a try!",

The portion is big and ingredients are plentiful. There are a lot of people queuing up. We placed our order at 12:31 pm and eventually got our food at 1:12pm.  A long wait, and I think worthy of the wait for the soup alone.",

Almost all customers are having chicken rice from this stall.\n\nI ordered half a chicken for our party of 4 people. I asked for it to be half white poached chicken and half roast chicken, which allowed me to have 2 flavors. The chicken is juicy and tender. They are generous with the soy sauce that is poured over the chicken before serving. It‚Äôs then topped with deep fried garlic pieces and coriander.\n\nTowards the bottom of the chicken plate, it can get salty.\n\nThey provided:\n- free cabbage soup and\n- fruit salad, which had cut pineapples, cucumber and carrots.\n\nThey have dark soy sauce, chilli dip and minced ginger dip to go with your chicken rice.\n\nRecommended! üòã\n\nüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",
