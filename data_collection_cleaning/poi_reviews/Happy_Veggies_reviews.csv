Y Lai,5,"A pretty unknown weekend morning only, farmers market. MUST call before going sometimes they bring all the stock to roadshow.

They sell a variety of vegetables not at the cheapest price as compared to the wet market (pictures included) but we buy with the peace of mind knowing that it is made in Singapore with no harmful pesticides unlike some suppliers that the vegetables look so perfect.

For people who own a garden, they also sell a variety of seedlings to speed up your harvest.

You can also spend a few minutes to walk around and admire the vertical farming.

The lift is the only way to enter the farm, so no point parking all the way up. Just park near the lift.

Otherwise just bring your phone and go for a morning jog.  They accept paynow.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115645356234591073588/reviews
