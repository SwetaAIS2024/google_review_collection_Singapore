      "text": "Gotten my Vanilla Christmas Log Cake from Three's A Crowd Cafe in Tampines during the Xmas period. Although late to review, would be doing a disservice if I don’t review at all!\n\nhis festive treat features a soft vanilla sponge rolled with a light, creamy ice cream filling. The cake is moist and not overly sweet, making it enjoyable even after a hearty meal. The presentation is charming, capturing the holiday spirit perfectly.\n\nFriends and family who tried it loved it!\n\nI recommend stopping by Three's A Crowd Cafe to enjoy their ice cream and waffles. 2 thumbs up!",

      "text": "Dear Three’s a Crowd Team,\n\nI visited your outlet in Tampines on the 5th April 2025 during the heavy downpour, as the weather was perfect for some gelato/ice-cream. I was impressed by the variety of gelatos available and was eager to try a couple of flavors. However, when I inquired about taste testing, I was told that it was not allowed at your store in a blant manner. This left me disappointed, as many other gelato or ice cream cafes in Singapore offer small spoon tastings, which is quite a kind gesture standard practice I've known about.\n\nDespite this, I decided to go ahead and order a scoop of pistachio gelato (which looked quite appealing) along with a tiramisu cake totaling up to $14. Before making the payment, I double-checked with your staff to confirm if I could get a refund for the gelato if it didn’t meet my expectations, to which I was told no. After trying afew spoons of the gelato, I found that it wasn't to my liking, which unfortunately left me feeling dissatisfied. Ofcourse every humans have a different taste bud and I don’t expect them to have a same liking . This would have resolved or helped a little by tasting it before confirming a purchase. I didn’t get the receipt of how much I actually paid for the small cup of 1 scoop gelato as I was already upset.\n\nI would like to share a couple of points:\n\nIt would be appreciated if your staff could communicate such policies in a kinder manner, rather than bluntly stating there are no tastings.\nI was quite surprised by the no-tasting policy, given the reviews I had read on Google, and it's unlike the approach taken by most gelato cafes in Singapore.\nWhile I understand every business has its policies, I believe it would help your customers feel more valued if this aspect was reconsidered. Ultimately, it was a small disappointing experience, especially since I had been looking forward to a relaxing and enjoyable treat along with The Tiramisu cake which did boost up my mood abit. Cake was delicious.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my feedback.",
