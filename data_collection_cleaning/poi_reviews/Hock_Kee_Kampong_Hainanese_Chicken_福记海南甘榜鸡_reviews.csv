Neo Yan Zong,5,"Randomly passed by this area; saw the reviews of this coffeeshop.. it wasn’t so good. However, had a feeling that I should give this stall a try. Turns out, great service, great food. One of the best chicken rice I have eaten for the year 2024 😌",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115364826538481040180/reviews
Gator,3,"We tried out the roasted chicken rice this evening. It occupied quite a big space within the coffee shop so we thought it should be good. But we found it rather mediocre. The rice wasn’t a bit fragrant at all. The chicken was really average. They were selling at $4 a plate which was reasonable in our opinion. As the coffee shop is new, it’s a clean and pleasant dining environment.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
Low Bao Heng,4,"Bought the Trio Combination Rice (Chicken + Char Siew + Roasted Pork) for $6.80 and I think it’s really value for money. It taste good too.

They are also generous with the portion so overall I would say it’s strongly recommended. Will try their other dish such as the white chicken in the near future. 😅",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108033403024309465290/reviews
"Yong Hui, Ronny Tan",4,"+ Chicken rice cheapest at $4, when some new coffeeshops already charging higher
+ Wanton Noodles were very Q

= Charsiew generally KL style delicious, though isolated small pieces were drier.

- Charsiew pieces were chopped too small.
- Soup wantons had very little minced pork inside",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103854866816776797/reviews
Dawn Chua,5,"Came here with my family members, ordered their roasted chicken rice, 白斬雞，叉燒燒肉. We find that the food is delicious and the meat is tender and soft. Highly recommend to come and try it out.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103560078686501497598/reviews
