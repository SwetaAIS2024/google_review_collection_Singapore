      "text": "Firstly, the outlook of the clinic was in shambles. Boxes and cartons of medicine and logistics covering 1/4 of the space in the waiting area as well as the triage room. It was quite a painful sight to see the front desk lady struggling to flip through the boxes to look for the medicine needed to be prescribed (Probably the reason why the waiting time for medicine dispensing takes longer than expected. Hope those medicine that needs to be chill are kept appropriately). Secondly, only three little makeshift stools are available for patients to sit. Definitely a far cry from most other Parkway Shenton clinics. Expected a higher standards in terms of customer experience from Parkway Shenton group. I hope Parkway Shenton can take a serious look in the upkeep of the clinic.",

      "text": "Went down to the clinic to request for a doctor memo for insurance claim and had a horrible experience.\n\nClinic assistant noted down the required contents of the memo stating the doctor consultation that led to a need for vaccination and asked me to wait while she processed it.\n\n1 hour later they were still not done, so I went to the counter to ask about the progress. Clinic assistant stated that i can go home first. She will give a call when ready.\n\nFirst of all, Parkway Shenton does not provide doctor memo via email. Secondly, what a lousy service at the counter after coming down to the clinic and having to wait for 1 hour just to be told to come back another time when the memo is ready.\n\nAnd that is not all. After confirming that they will provide the contents required again so that I don’t have to come back for a third time, they suddenly stated that i have to pay $10 for the doctor memo. I suddenly have to pay for the memo after 1 hour of waiting? Most other clinics don’t even have to pay for  doctor memo. This clinic not only requires payment, but suspiciously brought it up after 1 hour.\n\nRecommending to my company to change our panel of clinic to another one which can provide better service.\n\nConsultation with the doctor was okay though.",

I had visited this clinic twice, today and in Jan this year, and both times, experienced bad attitude from the doctor (Dr. Chan). He was rude, in how he communicate and the look (not sure if it is because i am not local here). I had never experienced a doctor with bad attitude like him in my life. Didn't advise on my sickness at all, but always suggested me go for heath screening. Just bad... will never visit there again :(",
