Ravi Varmah,5,I have been to so many hospitals but here at neuro centre have to best service I have received. Ms Joyce at front desk is absolutely the best. The way she took care of me was so good. She definitely needs a raise for how she is doing here job. Not forgetting Dr David. He been so tentative.  Listened to my problems and helped me so much.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104023858689131807898/reviews

Joel Ang,1,"Dr Ramani, a neurosurgeon under this hospital gave a diagnosis to my uncle, that was never his patient to begin with lol! My uncle is a severe stroke patient and is currently NUH, yet he gave a diagnosis of my uncle being able to go home without even physically evaluating or seeing him before.This is extremely shocking to hear, especially with the ethics of being a medical professional. We will follow up and report this unethical doctor to the Singapore Medical Council.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114322133173557642993/reviews
