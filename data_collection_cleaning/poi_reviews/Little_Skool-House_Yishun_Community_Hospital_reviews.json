      "text": "I recently visited the Little Skool-House@YCH after receiving a call from the Admissions Relation Assistant, during which I was informed there were vacancies, thus a Centre Visit was arranged.\n\nHowever, during the visit, I was unexpectedly told by the same Relation Assistant that there was no guarantee of availability, which contradicted the earlier information.\n\nWhile I wasn't fully committed to enrolling my child to the school, Clear and transparent communication from the outset would have been greatly appreciated, as it would have not led to unnecessary time spent visiting the school.\n\nThe discrepancy between the information provided over the phone and what was told in person have left a poor impression.\n\nI hope this feedback can help improve the admissions process for other parents in the future.",
