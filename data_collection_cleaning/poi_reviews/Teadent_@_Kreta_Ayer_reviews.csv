Low Joo Tat,5,"Booked Teadent for an afternoon for team meetings. They have a really good deal on weekdays that is way way way cheaper than any coworking space in the market.

They have all the basics covered - tables and chairs, fast WiFi, plugs, air con, toilet. Nothing fancy but more than good enough for us. Really liked that we had the whole big space (2 levels) to ourselves. The high ceiling and old school windows makes for a nice refreshing change of environment.

The location is pretty awesome - walking distance to Outram and Chinatown MRT and there’s plenty of good food around (cheap hawkers to preppy cafes to atas bars) for lunch or after work drinks.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110186837008475705070/reviews
J T,5,"My company hired Teadent Space for 1 weekday afternoon 12-5pm) as a meeting space. It’s a flexible space with ample sunlight from its repurposed shop windows. There are two floors, with one toilet and multiple powerpoints. One wall is covered with full length mirrors, for yoga, dance, meditation classes etc. I saw at least two AC units on each floor with ceiling fans that worked well. It was a peaceful environment and the (very) light traffic from the road outside did not intrude at all. Nearby, there are multiple food options, convenience stores, bus stops, and a short walk to MRT stations.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109005605487931047505/reviews
D C,5,"Been attending Jazz Inc’s dance classes and MOVE Academy’s movement classes at Teadent. It’s pretty, homely and spacious. I can imagine this to be a thriving community space for people from different backgrounds.

It’s centrally located (in Outram/Chinatown), very accessible by MRT, and I like that there are many hawker food options, restaurants, cafes and bars around the area.

Love it!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117158264009566524264/reviews
Tan Shao Ming,5,"I have gotten tired from working at home for the last 4 months and was looking for an alternative place to work from.

I was very lucky to chance upon Teadent as it was the exact place I was looking for. Large room, high walls, quiet environment, long windows with natural light and a nice view of the street below.. I can go on and on.

The space manager has created a conducive place where I can concentrate on my work and feel like i'm at home. What sealed the deal for me was the affordable rates!

I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for an alternative work space.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101651416183082405818/reviews
Chen Shanhan,5,"Visited Teadent for a weekday afternoon and used it as a co-working space.
We were the only ones who booked the place, it was plenty spacious and had a nice view. There's wi-fi, air con, tables and chairs - you can even opt to work on the floor, they have a carpet and sitting desk.
I like the location, it's just a few minutes walk from the MRT station and there's tons of food options nearby.

I'd come back again, highly recommend it!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102256261652572658090/reviews
