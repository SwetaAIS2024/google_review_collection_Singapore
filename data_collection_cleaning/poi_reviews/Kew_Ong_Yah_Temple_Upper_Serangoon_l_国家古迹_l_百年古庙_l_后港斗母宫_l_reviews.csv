Sandra,5,"Surprised to find this 100+ year old temple here in the heartlands as not many old buildings get to be preserved in the neighbourhoods. Lots of heritage value and beautiful stories behind this temple. Tonight, with the earlier downpour, the temple looked even prettier!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103115080435067308189/reviews
Klaudia Puah,5,"Temple mistress was lovely. Went in for a juju-refresh and came out a new born calf. In all seriousness I think might be my favourite temple, visually. love the open space and helpful numbered prompts for the different 'praying/altar-stations' for those not familiar with the order of convention. I will be back when my mind or spirit finds itself in need of divine comfort and wide-eyed respite.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111757879356426478619/reviews
