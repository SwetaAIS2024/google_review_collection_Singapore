Just one thing to note: the rooms are small but comfortable for one person and are very well-maintained. If you need a safe, clean, and comfortable stay and are traveling alone, this hotel could be an option.\n\nLooking forward to staying here again someday.üòä‚ù§Ô∏èüôèü§û",

Room was fairly small and didn't have a lot of space for two people. Bed was adequate, but pillows weren‚Äôt very comfortable nor were the sheets. The pool area looked quite different than the pictures. It was pretty small and not maintained great as the wall seemed ‚Äòunclean‚Äô and chairs were scattered about. It felt a bit squished into the space. Hotel was conveniently located from metro station.",

Reception was quick to send maintenance however he says open the window but this was impossible as it was locked - he checked and couldn‚Äôt so he turned my aircon down to 16 degrees, mopped the walls dry and did not respond to me saying carpet was damp as was my bed and bag. I turned air con up as who can enjoy 16 degrees! Reception was ok but not interested after initial check in. My cleaner was awesome - she was so kind. I wouldn‚Äôt stay again - pay a bit more and get a room that does not suffer from condensation and damp. I also bought ear plugs to stop the noise although they advertise quiet.",
