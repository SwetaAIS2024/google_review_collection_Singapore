S Lee,1,"Approached the staff whether they are still opened he said yes. Was around 8.40pm. Placed order for 2 sets of waffles with double scoop each, popcorn chicken, mac and cheese and a shake. The shake arrived first at 8.53pm. Minutes apart popcorn chicken then mac and cheese and the 2 sets of waffles with double scoop arrived at 8.58pm.

9.05pm the other staff came to say they are closing soon. 9.13pm she came again to say they are close now. The total bill cost $80 over bucks. With the waffles arriving last you expect us to gobble up the waffles?

The operating hours states that bugis plus outlet are from 11.30am to 10pm. Appreciate if you can update your website and also educate your staff. Very unpleasant experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109958511036718563320/reviews
Gwen Koh,2,"30Apr2025: Came here around 840pm. Greeted with a ""closed"" sign. Went to check on opening hours - indicated as 10pm. But staff confirmed closed. Asked her if able to do takeaway, she looked at the cashier counter unwillingly and proceeded to sigh and took our takeaway order reluctantly. Very very bad experience.

Otherwise, the ice cream is good, though very melted.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104173222339074754582/reviews
Icha Nafisa,5,"Gelare is my go to waffle place when waffle craving kicks in since long time ago üôà.

This time round, i went to the bugis outlet on 2nd November. The waffles were crispy on the outside anddd soft and fluffy in the inside. For the ice cream, it's veryy yummy of course ü´∞üèº

Staffs were friendly and very helpful especially the malay lady.

Wesley Wong,4,"Gelare's ice cream selection is quite impressive, offering a wide range of delicious flavors to choose from. Whether you prefer classic options like vanilla and chocolate or more adventurous ones like mint fudge or blueberry cheesecake, Gelare has something for every ice cream lover. The quality and richness of their ice cream are truly satisfying.

However, it's important to note that the service at Gelare can be a bit sluggish. While the wait might be justified by the delicious ice cream, it's something to consider if you're in a hurry.

Another aspect to take into account is the ambiance. Gelare's location on the 5th floor of Bugis+ means it's generally quieter compared to some other dessert places in busier areas. This can be a positive if you're looking for a peaceful setting to enjoy your ice cream, but it's not the ideal choice if you're seeking a bustling, lively atmosphere.

To sum it up, Gelare provides excellent ice cream with a wide variety of flavors. Just be prepared for the possibility of slower service and a more tranquil atmosphere due to its location on the 5th floor of Bugis+.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107433449088212182977/reviews
