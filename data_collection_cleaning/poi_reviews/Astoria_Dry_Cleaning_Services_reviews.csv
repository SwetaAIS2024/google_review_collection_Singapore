Hail Santa,1,"Completely unacceptable and unprofessional!

Delivery was randomly scheduled for a Sat morning without my confirmation. The courier was ringing constantly at my door for 10mins, depriving my family of much-needed rest on a weekend. Furthermore, my explicit request to change delivery times was blatantly ignored by Astoria HQ staff, whose replies were slow and sloppy.

The standard industry practice is to CONFIRM delivery timeslot first rather than assuming that the customer accepts, esp for expensive items like clothes sent for dry cleaning. What if me or my family members were not around at that time? This is the last time I'm using Astoria. Disappointing!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109489738367997290466/reviews
Gbmy Pqie,2,"Brought our winter clothes to dry clean on Tuesday, was told we could come pick up (we chose self pick-up) on Saturday so we thought cool, relatively fast. But one of the winter clothes was actually a two-piece, and we realised after collection on Saturday that the inner piece was not returned to us. Will provide an update on how it goes tomorrow; if we‚Äôre able to get the inner piece back.

Update: we did manage to get the second piece back üëç",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104291587630726767034/reviews
