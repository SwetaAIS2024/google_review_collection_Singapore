      "text": "There is this very biased teacher in this school. I will not mention her name because even though she is very mean and petty, I believe that she is still considered nice to lower primary students and I don't want to ruin her image. Just because I left my CCA to focus more on my studies, she started targeting me in PE class and found a reason to scold me every lesson. She even went as far as to try to make my friends leave me! Luckily, they are true friends and didn't leave me. Now, the reason I gave this school a 5 star review is because other than her, the school is wonderful. Especially my form teachers. They always support me. Hopefully, the biased teacher will change. Thank you for taking your time to read this review. BTW, I think the biased teacher was the head of CCA and didn't like it when I left.",

      "text": "Love this school!!!! Ms Hon and Mdm DIng are my Math and Mother Tongue teachers respectively. If you somehow manage to get either of them. Good Job! (Ms Hon might not be there, but there's still Mdm Ding)\nWushu CCA is nice, if you don't mind martial art related things. I really love the library, it has a lot of my favourite books and if you accidentally forget to do any homework related to the computer, for school purposes of course, you can access the computers there.",
