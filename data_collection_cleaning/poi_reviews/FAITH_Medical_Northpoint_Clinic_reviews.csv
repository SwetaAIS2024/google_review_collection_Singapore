Britney Tan,2,"Booked an appointment at 2pm today and arrived early at about 1.45pm +-, was told to wait for the doctor to be back at 2 so i waited in the clinic’s waiting area. After about 10 mins a walk in came into the clinic and asked to see the doctor so the nurse registered her first like is there no principal of first come first served here or what ??? anyways as I’m writing this its 2.30 and I’m still sitting in the clinic’s waiting area??? see what you will from this bad review but if i were you i would not come here

HE_ Chin,5,"I had a very positive experience at Northpoint branch with Dr. Lim Han Wei. The doctor was excellent as he took the time to carefully review my past medical history, explained everything clearly, and even corrected some misunderstandings I had about my condition. I really appreciated how thorough and professional he was. He also suggested a diagnosis that made sense and helped me understand the next steps. Highly recommended Dr Lim HW!!!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117288342638259380892/reviews

Nur Liyana,5,Brought my daughter to the clinic today at around 8.15pm as she was feeling unwell and was served by the staff at the counter. She was very sweet and helped with the registration very swiftly. Didn't managed to catch her name! My daughter was consulted by Dr Lim Han Wei. He was very thorough with his checks and gave very clear answers and addressed my concerns very well. Truly a pleasant visit. Thank you to the staff and Dr that attended to us!,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103372262224843330834/reviews
Muhammad Nasir,5,"I visited the clinic today and my experience was nothing but magnificent. The waiting time wasn't too long for me.

Front desk was polite and kind. He even brought me to the doctor's door for my consultation which I have never experience in other clinics.

I was then greeted by Dr. Lim Han Wei during my consultation and after some Q&A for my diagnosis. He gave me a detailed and beneficial advise, tips & examples on how to rectify my health concerns. Besides prescribing the medicine.

It was a great experience! All the best and keep striving!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112260378922282426138/reviews
