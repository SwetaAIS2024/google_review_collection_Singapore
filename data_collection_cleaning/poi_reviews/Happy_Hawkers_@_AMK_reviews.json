Come early before 730pm as their herbal chicken and other soup run out before that. However, didn‚Äôt try the other stalls so can‚Äôt give it 5 stars. But was happy to stumble to this coffee shop as all the stores are closed in the hawker Center nearby.",

      "text": "Would have given 5 stars because the tze char stall is fantastic‚Äîfriendly staff and great food.\n\nHowever, the drinks stall completely ruined the experience. On 27 Feb around 1pm, there were two staff: one making the coffee and another at the counter. The lady making the coffee was friendly, but the counter staff was extremely impatient, despite there being no queue.\n\nWhen I ordered a Milo Dinosaur (which wasn‚Äôt available), she showed clear annoyance. When I asked for a canned green tea, she shouted at me and my students to take it from the fridge. She even shouted at the coffee lady while confirming if my coffee was hot or cold.\n\nUnacceptable service given that the coffee shop is called Happy Hawker. I would have been happier if I have gotten my drinks from ITE instead.",
