Iffah Jafferi,5,"My heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional care and dedication the teachers has shown towards both my son's in infant and nursery. Their nurturing approach and commitment to my son's development have truly made a positive impact on their growth. We are grateful for their hard work and the safe, supportive environment they create every day.

And the principal's Ms. Farah, proactive and positive engagement with us, has made a significant difference in our experience. The open communication and willingness to listen demonstrates a true commitment to fostering a supportive community.
Thank you to the teachers and principal for all your dedication to creating a warm and inclusive environment where both children and parents feel valued and heard. Your efforts do not go unnoticed and are deeply appreciated.

Glad that we made the right choice of placing both my children in Brilliant Tots Jurong West.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113568344089645643726/reviews
Abigail Low,5,"My child has been attending this centre since infant days. The cook and infant care team are fantastic! She has now progressed to childcare and is reading well for her age. Her Mandarin has also improved greatly under the current teacher. She loves the music and movement sessions as well. Most importantly, she enjoys going to school every day. Keep up the good work teachers!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103922886209655734553/reviews
