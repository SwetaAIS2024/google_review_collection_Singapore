Leo Ziming,1,"Extremely good doctor with an extremely rude receptionist! Called on behalf of my mother who is a regular patron of Dr. Ko‚Äôs clinic to make an appointment. Few days later, we still did not receive any confirmation message thus I called again to get them to resend. However, first thing i got from the receptionist was ‚ÄúYou got to understand we have many patients, so once a message sent, your appointment is fixed‚Äù.

But i didn‚Äôt get any message and thats why i am asking you to resend?!

Bloody ridiculous CS right here.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100731410840615597539/reviews
Joyce Lim,5,"Dr Ko was patient, thorough, polite, professional, yet affable. I felt I was in good hands when consulting with him, didn't feel rushed at all, and felt he listened well before making a diagnosis. He was knowledgeable, and could explain medical concepts in layman terms so I could understand. Consultation room wasn't cold at all, unlike some clinics that are freezing, the room tended towards warmer temp so do not have to bring sweater. Window was by the table and let in ample natural light. Chairs were reasonably comfortable to sit in for long conversations. First consult minimum sgd240, subsequent consult cheaper. Recept was an unobtrusive lady who was polite too. Clinic is easy to find, 2nd level of the A&E block of Mt Alvernia.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114306834103372851451/reviews
