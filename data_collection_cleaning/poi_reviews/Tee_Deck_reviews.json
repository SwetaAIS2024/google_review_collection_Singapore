      "text": "I had a group dinner at this outdoor restaurant inside Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore, and while the food was absolutely fantastic, the overall experience was somewhat affected by the noise from passing planes.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was definitely the seafood barbecue, which was expertly grilled and full of flavor. The seafood was fresh, perfectly cooked, and well-seasoned, making it the standout of the evening. The restaurant also offers a good variety of dishes, ensuring that thereâ€™s something for everyone to enjoy. The ambiance was lovely, with an open-air setting that created a relaxed, resort-like atmosphere.\n\nHowever, one major downside was the noise from airplanes flying directly overhead. Since the hotel is located right beneath the flight path, planes passed by almost every other minute, making conversations difficult and disrupting the otherwise pleasant atmosphere. The sound was so loud at times that we had to pause our conversations until the plane passed.",

This place close very early, their last order is 8pm. We ordered the baby pork rib and the lobster roll.\n\nThe baby pork rib come with BBQ sauce on the top, it taste average. I like the lobster roll as the bread is very soft, can taste the butter together with the lobster meat.\n\nWe also tried the Thai Ice Tea, it tasted good! Do remember to ask sugar separate for this as it will be very sweet if you do not remind them.",

      "text": "Ambience was beautiful as the restaurant is located beside the gorgeous Dusit Thani pool. Not air conditioned but fairly cooling.\n\nFood has hits and misses hence the 3 stars. Their signature burger was really good with a sizeable portion. Had one of the Thai dishes â€” the fish was decent but their chilli was really nice and packed a punch. Also had their keto salad which was pretty pathetic for $18 tbh. Barely any avocadoes visible and it looked like a hastily thrown plate of veggies.\n\nWouldnâ€™t come back here if not for the 20% membership promo that I have.",
