h sim,4,"S$2 promo price for the winglet meal. Great value. Good chicken wing, I liked that they didn't use too much marinade. Pasta had real tomato bits. Coleslaw is good. Their other mains tend to be too oily and the sides very sweet. Will be even better if they can use less oil & sugar.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113735981929708435011/reviews
