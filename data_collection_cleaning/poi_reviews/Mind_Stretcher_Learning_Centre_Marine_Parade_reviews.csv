Hong Wei,4,"Dear Teacher Jay,I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for your invaluable support and guidance that you had provided me in my journey to achieve stellar results in English.

Your dedication, patience, and thoughtful teaching methods have truly made a difference. The way you broke down complex English principles, going through corrections with us, pinpoint each of our strengths and weaknesses in our worksheets and composition writing, providing extra study notes had helped me improved my understanding and use of  language skills,.

Vidhubala Balaji,5,My daughter went to Mindstretcher Marine Parade for P6 science. Teacher was Mrs Chandra Malar. She was very caring and attentive. Took extra focus to drill in concepts as well as answering techniques and was providing constant feedback and helping answer questions even via phone outside of lesson timing. Would really recommend her for students.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108446164769428654617/reviews
