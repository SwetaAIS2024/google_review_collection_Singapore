      "text": "I have been studying here for the last five months, and I have to say it has been the best experience I’ve had with any language school. After studying here, my Chinese has definitely improved. Not only have I learned the language itself, but I have also gained cultural insights — whether in class from the teachers or through activities organised by the school.\nThe staff were very friendly and welcoming, ensuring clear communication between students and the school. The teachers were thoughtful and caring, delivering lessons with dedication. They didn’t just go through the material but genuinely helped students understand it.\nThe learning environment and facilities are definitely a plus. The school provides everything students need and creates a very comfortable atmosphere.\nOverall, I’m really happy that I chose Inlingua to study Chinese, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a language school in Singapore — not just for Chinese, but for any language!",

The courses are great and emphasize oral speaking, which is excellent for learning English for beginners and intermediate levels. It's perfect for learning how to speak English informally and communicate your thoughts, but a bit less if you’re looking to perfect it in a formal and professional way.\n\nOverall, a positive experience !",
