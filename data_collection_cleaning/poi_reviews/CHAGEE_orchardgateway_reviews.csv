Flo Yeow,5,"The consistently long queues at this milk tea shop are understandable once you taste their product. The tea has a delicate yet distinct flavor, perfectly complemented by the fresh milk, creating a drink that isn't heavy. Even after a filling hotpot meal, the milk tea was thoroughly enjoyable. It seems they've truly mastered the art of brewing tea for a balanced and refreshing beverage.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
K Tan,3,"Collect drinks also must queue.
Guess the system is not optimized.
So so drink taste nothing special , just the hype and branding.
Many drinks in menu were sold out, not available during visit.

Stall design looks upscale. Limited seating area.
Location is convenient , always busy.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105592887493237423833/reviews
Putri Titian,3,"The place was super crowded.
Better to order first and walk around the mall while waiting.
The tea was okay, nothing special.
But the packaging was really nice ‚Äî even the paper bag can be reused.
I think I just liked the packaging more than the tea..",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112530854262661800365/reviews
Reena Leechiu,5,"There was a line but it was fast just waited a few minutes. Confusing that they wanted us to download the app but you cant get the promos coz it is just for residents in Singapore. üòµ‚Äçüí´
The ordering and pick up of drinks  were very organized and people very trusting. That you just get your drinks when you see your number on the screen and cups.
Hope we can have the same system in the Philippines ü•≥",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103053204573533523879/reviews
Jocelin Lam,4,"I‚Äôm quite blessed! I was there without the queue and retrieving my drink was all right. There were only 2 person in front of me but I waited 5-7 minutes to collect my drink. There was only 1 person at the dispense counter and she was a little slow. The tea was prepare quickly but slow to collect. I wanted to do a review for this particular store mainly because of the access to the seating area. There‚Äôs a flight of stairs to get up. Hence not very wheelchair friendly. A friend had to take a big round to get up to the seating. Otherwise, everything is very good here. The milk tea was very good as usual.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108309078007094838575/reviews
