      "text": "Disappointed with the smoked beer battered fish. Saw the pic in one of the reviews, looked good with 2 pieces of fish. Turned out to be only 1 piece with soggy batter, not crispy at all. I only tasted smoke and nothing else. Fish and batter were so bland, I had to add salt for taste apart from the tartar sauce.\n\nThe grilled chicken my hubby had tasted way better. Well seasoned to the right saltiness. Thumbs up for that.\nService staff are friendly.",

      "text": "Decided I needed comfort food and this BBQ joint has been on my list for a while, so I hauled myself over to @smokeysbbq.sg in Joo Chiat for what I hoped was going to deliver some awesome home cooking. Man, did it ever!!!\n\nWe started with the chili cheese tater tots because duh, tots+cheese+chili = amazing. Crispy tots were finished off with cheese, chili, jalapeños, and sour cream and we all tucked in and loved them. Next stop was the BBQ combo - baby back ribs, brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken with sides of coleslaw and cornbread. All the meats were super juicy and fork tender, the meat fell off the bone on the ribs, and the brisket could be pulled with a pork. Kudos on the chicken as it was not dried out at all.  Definitely the crowd favorite was brisket. The original BBQ sauce was great, but I loved the kick from the ghost sauce, spicy and sweet. Cornbread was equally yummy, and the coleslaw was so good we ordered a second serving.\n\nFor dessert we had the chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. While it was very tasty, I’d call this more cake than brownie, but it didn’t stop us from finishing it all off. Great beer selection, and since it was St. Patrick’s Day we had green beer which definitely reminded me of home.\n\nAll in all an awesome experience with great service and a very authentic BBQ vibe. Highly recommend",

Glad that it wasn’t too noisy or crowded!\nGot to try lots of variations of meat because of their combo set offer where you can order different selections with sides! Really liked the tater tots too!\nThe owner was very nice, I mentioned in my booking that it was a bachelors night and they gave us a round of shots on the house!",
