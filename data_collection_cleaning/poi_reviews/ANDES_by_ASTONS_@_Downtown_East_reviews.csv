Elijah Tan,4,"We visited Andes at Downtown East on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, which was perfect as there weren’t many customers. The peaceful atmosphere made for a pleasant dining experience.

I’ve always loved their Fiery Chicken, and once again, they didn’t disappoint. The crispy skin and tender, succulent meat were absolutely spot-on—delicious as ever! I don’t know how they manage to get it so perfect every time, but it’s a must-try for anyone visiting.

If there’s one area for improvement, it would be the service. It felt a bit awkward overhearing staff conversations while we were dining. Perhaps the staff could check on customers more frequently to enhance the overall experience.

That said, I still love Andes for their consistently amazing food. It’s always a treat!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109287346354369266778/reviews
IsaBeLLa LeViNe,5,"Had an early dinner here with my kids after their swim class and we all enjoyed it! The mac & cheese and fries were a hit with the little ones, and the New York strip was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Service was friendly and fast, and the place has a welcoming vibe—very family-friendly. We’ll definitely be back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110472731929988223025/reviews

Victor Lim,4,"Had dinner at Andes @ DTE.

Halal certified and MUIS accredited.

Great place for our MUSLIM friends!

Chargrilled Chicken and Black Pepper Chicken was fantastic.

Mac and Cheese tasted a bit watered down. The cheese was diluted and not great taste.

The other sides were all right.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108789096091155395479/reviews
