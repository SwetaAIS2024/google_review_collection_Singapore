Ashvin, Russell & Kevin  definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of service quality, professionalism and they delivered more than what was promised.

Highly recommended. 10/10 . Thanks again Ashvin, Russell and Kevin. Kudos guys keep up the excellent work. Will definitely engaged them again. Cheers",

      "text": "We had The Barmen for a 100pax event at our showroom. They were amazing in every way possible. Arriving earlier than expected, they got the bar and drinks ready in a relaxed and chill manner, including changing out to sharp looking synchronised outfits with our requests of bowtie and vests! Drinks provided through the night received endless compliments from our guests. Drinks were curated prior the event, together with The Barmen, to offer subtle twists to well loved and well known classics such as G&T, Whisky Sour & Negroni. The Barmen took on the big thirsty crowd all night with composure and delivered great drinks non-stop alongside delivering smiles through the nights. It was an absolute pleasure for everyone and definitely a highlight for the night. Thank you Russell & team! Looking forward to the next possible event with you guys again.",
