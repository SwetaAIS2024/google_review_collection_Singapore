r r,4,"Older lady at reception is very rude. Dr Lim is fantastic so will return. But hope they can train their receptionists better. They registered my name wrongly in spite of typing it from my IC. I assumed they were just mispronouncing my name like most Singaporeans do. I had to get it rectified as I needed it accurate on a referral letter. But instead of apologising when I went back to have the letter changed, the reception lady, visibly annoyed, huffed and asked me why I didn't highlight it in my earlier visit and rudely asked me to hand her my documents so she can make the changes. Its 10am and this lady is already so agitated....",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113665822105953580696/reviews
Zhenghao Huang,5,"I’ve been visiting Dr Lim for nearly 25 years, I think since my secondary school days. I’m 42 now.   He is the friendliest and most effective doctor. Sometimes I visit other clinics but their medicine just can’t match up to what Dr Lim prescribes.

If you live in a 5 km radius from his clinic and need to get yourself rectified, do try him out. He’s the best!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107597699542872438183/reviews
