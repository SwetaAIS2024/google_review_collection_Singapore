Lin Lin,5,"I was there with my helper this morning. Prior to the visit, I booked an appointment over WhatsApp yesterday, response was prompt. When I reached at 7.30am today, there was already a very long queue but because of my appointment scheduled, it was still very swift and fast. I then left my helper there for medical check up and nurse told me they will bring her up for SIP after the check up.

After I left the clinic, I received a message from the nurse regarding my helper’s short sightedness. They told me to get her a pair of glasses. They said they have also in-house optician to prescribe her the necessary. Price for same day collection is also very reasonable $100+ inclusive of GST.

Throughout the whole process, I was greeted with friendly nurses. Despite the crowd in the mornin, the nurse answered my questions patiently, as it was my first time there. I want to compliment the staffs:

1. Registration staff Chloe
2. Admin Nat
3. Clinic manager Sandi

They all worked together to help me settle my helper’s medical checkup, SIP and glasses prescription smoothly and efficiently. When I received my helper at 4.40pm today, I also received the medical report at the same time! What a hassle-free service provided! Not to also mention their great and responsive, thank u so much Kingston!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110339607376172141675/reviews
Ho Ah Ngen Ho,5,"I’m a senior citizen of 82 yrs old. I took my son, intellectually disabled man of 40 yrs old for medical check up.
There were many people there for medical test . Most of them were maids and foreign workers.
I was given a number. I was told to wait for about 45 minutes for my turn. After 45 minutes I was still waiting.
Just then a lady, Xin Ru who was working in the clinic took a chair for me to sit down. She then asked what I was here for. I told her I took my intellectually disabled son for medical test.
She was a living example of a kind, sincere and thoughtful person. Seeing my condition; an old man who could hardly walk properly and towing an intellectually disabled son,  she helped to get my disabled son for his medical test.
She was so courteous that she even got a payment machine to me to make my payment.
I’ve not seen such a courteous, kind and sincere person for a long time.
I congratulate Kingston Medical Clinic for having such a valuable staff like Xin Ru. She will be a valuable asset to your clinic and humanity.
Little act of kindness of hers will make your medical Center a popular one in your region.
Thank you very much Xin Ru.
Thank you Kingston Medical Clinic for your services and congratulation for having such a kind and thoughtful staff as Xin Ru.
My deepest appreciation to you all.
Thank you, thank you and thank you.
