Have bought ice cream from here where the entire tub is frostbitten on at least two occasions.\nWhich seems to suggest their handling of the ice cream possibly allows it to melt rather a great deal before they put it into the freezers. I have had to throw out newly purchased ice cream due to this issue and I live nearby in the area.\n\nBut as they say; fool me once, shame on you.\nFool me twice, shame on me.",

      "text": "Great service from Jaya at the gourmet food section. So accomodative, friendly and helpful in  serving me for my Christmas orders.\nThe orders were on time.\nThe roast were awesome! The ibirico pork ribs were fantastic , premium cut and well roasted juicy and with good portion of meat.\nHer suggestion to order 3 racks for my party were spot on. The Turkey too was beautiful roasted. And so was the pork knuckle .Great service with a smile.  She even helped me carry them to my car as it was heavy. Super helpful . A valuable asset to Cold storage.\nThanks from Peggy Teong",
