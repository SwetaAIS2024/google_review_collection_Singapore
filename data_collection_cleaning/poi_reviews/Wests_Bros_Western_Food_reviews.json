      "text": "$5.80 for this chicken chop with spaghetti, itâ€™s worth the price. ðŸ¤©\n\nThough have to queue - from ordering to the food is served, the wait is not as bad as other western food stalls as the stall has two people cooking the food. We waited around 15 mins in total.\n\nYou can choose your carbs - rice, spaghetti or fries. The food is well-marinated with spices (garlic, black pepper), and the chicken chop is not dry. The portion is not small and meat is of reasonable thickness (definitely thicker than the famous golden arch meat patties). Can feel the efforts put in by the cooks despite the challenge to serve the food in a short time frame.\n\nThis place is a little far but convenient for people living in the West. You can find this stall at Jurong West Hawker Centre (JW50). They are opened only during lunch and dinner hours, please note their staggered operating hours: 11am to 2pm and 5pm to 8pm. The stall is opened for six days and closed on every Monday.\n\nWestâ€™s Bro Western Food stall (#01-07)\n50 Jurong West Street 61, Singapore 648202",

      "text": "You would not expect much of a crowd at 5pm, the start of their evening opening hours but I was so wrong.\n\nWhile queueing 10 minutes just to take my order, some tables were already enjoying their grilled meat with spaghetti and fries. Even uncles and aunties are enjoying the food, so it says a lot.\n\nThe wait for the food was around 25 minutes. Luckily I had Munchi to accompany me as I waited with my food pager.\n\nA glance into the kitchen shows a well prepared and organised team, working at a fast pace to fulfill orders. My linguine and fries were packed separately from the baked beans, coleslaw and meat.\n\nOn my way home, the delicious fragrance emancipated from the food packaging, signaling me to get home fast!\n\nThe prawn paste chicken cutlet ($7) was within expectations, but we were more blown away by the grilled meats instead. Getting the mixed grill ($10.80) was the right choice, so we can focus on our favourites if we even head back there again.\n\nWe agreed that this is comparable to Chef Hainanese Western at Margaret Drive HC. The guys here are friendlier too!",

      "text": "I visited this hawker stall specializing in Western food and ordered the pork chop. The portion was generous for the price, and the taste had that old-school, nostalgic flavor. However, the pork chop was slightly on the charred side, which might not be to everyoneâ€™s liking. The stall is quite popular, so be prepared for a long queue and some waiting time. Overall, a good option if youâ€™re craving hearty, classic Western food at a reasonable price.",

      "text": "1. I order pork chop with fries , other options are spaghetti and rice with pork chop ,  these options are good enough , The suggestion is to add mashed potatoes 1 day in a week or any other  special days.\n2. Why 1 star for Food i was served , my constructive feedback back is on pork chop I was served ,  not on shop or other dishes being served,  , fries are good crispy and good portions of fries are served , coleslaw is good right amount of sweet, crispy and right portion, beans no need to  mention it's canned beans can skip , it's same all.wover the world ,but good , big let down is the pork chop , suppose to be star of the plate  , too TOUGh, cooked as if he is  in rush and going to miss his first date with Ms.Gao. Dressing is good right amount of pepper heat. My suggestion is  Spare some time and some love to  the chop lah brother.",
