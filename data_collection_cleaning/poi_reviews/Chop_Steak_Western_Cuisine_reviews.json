Spring chicken also tasted very good. Pork chop slightly tough but still tasty. Love my mentaiko dory! Aglio olio also full of flavour. I will order from them again!!",

When it’s ready, was suspicious as usually the 1/2 dozen wings will come with a box the charge $0.30  but instead it’s in small paper bag. Check and found Only 4 wings instead of 6. Confronted the guy and he swiftly gave another 2 wings without asking or apologising.\nPlease check your orders before going away.",
