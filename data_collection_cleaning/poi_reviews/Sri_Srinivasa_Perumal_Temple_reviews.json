      "text": "While in the area we wanted to have the opportunity to visit this temple, as someone who is not Hindi I find it interesting to observe how the devotees pray. We have, as far as I know, nothing like this in Germany. For non Hindi you must remove your shoes (you can wear socks), if you are a woman you must dress modestly and cover your shoulders. Men who wear a tank top or shorts above the knees must wear a provided men‚Äôs sari. While we were there a tourist was taking photos of people and making a video of the inner area and this is forbidden! To photograph people you must ask their permission too! I am not faulting the temple, but really please do respect their rules. I took photos of a few things with this in mind. Well worth the visit if you want to open your mind to different ways of living.",

So limited parking only available on a first come first serve basis. Usually every Saturday is crowded and offers prasatham.",
