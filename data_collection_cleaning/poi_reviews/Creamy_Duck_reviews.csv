Kai,4,"Interesting name with an interesting range of offerings.

The chocolate chip cookie pan seemed a tad small but very tastey and chewy. 5/5 recommended ($12.90)

Root beer float was.. pretty normal. 3.5/5 ($5)",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103961412486889059100/reviews
Bobby W,5,"Heard about this place some time ago. Visited by bicycle with my daughter late afternoon for a Bobo tea, waffles with ice cream and some takoyaki balls. The Bobo was good and refreshing after a hot bike ride. The marshmallow waffle was the best my daughter has ever had she said. The takoyaki was steaming hot with octopus tentacles. Good sized seating area overlooking the runway 1 (02L/20R). The young girl working that afternoon was friendly and efficient. Will come again with the toddler.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105546078035523582140/reviews
Yourboy reacts,5,"the brownies w/ icecream tasted so good and the triple chocolate milkshake was also extremely good in my opinion, but the wait to get your food was like 10-20 minutes. Best part is that you can see the planes from the tables",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104010710770224427390/reviews

Aashmika Varma,4,"One of the best brownie on ice creams I’ve had! The brownie was super chocolatey and fudgy and the ice cream completed the brownie so well.
However, I really didn’t like the root beer - it tasted like Crocin or some sort of medicine and it was too sweet!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104152931382854540911/reviews
