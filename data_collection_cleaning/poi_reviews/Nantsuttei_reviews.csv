Peiyi (Potato),4,"Pretty good black garlic oil ramen. Noodles texture were not Q and firm enough for my liking. Gyoza and octopus karaage were ok. Not a fan of the miso soup, tasty diluted to me.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114036053255574074804/reviews
Alicia,5,"Went during lunch on a weekday. It was busy but not crowded. Quick service, and even my tea was refilled without any prompts. Ramen broth was rich and delicious. Lunch set with ramen, a side and a drink was about $20.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111454597467966256107/reviews
Aerosmith 09,4,"Came here around 12.15pm on a Friday afternoon. We were a party of 5 (4 adults and 1 child) and this is what we got:

3 bowls of Kara-miso ramen with 2 of them being lunch sets. 1 extra order of noodles and 1 rice bowl with char siew. 2 plates of chicken karaage. We got spice level 2.

I was recovering from the flu and it was still a touch too spicy for me. I think level 1 would’ve been more comfortable as level 2 hit the back of my throat with the chilli. Having said that, the broth was rich and flavourful. The pork was very soft and not at all gamey. Very tasty. I’ve had other ramen places in Singapore with bad char siew and this is not one of them!!

We had both pork and chicken gyoza and the pork definitely tasted better. The chicken karaage was fried to perfection and the wasabi mayo on them was great.

At the end the rice bowl with a bit of the broth we added on was fantastic as well.

I would definitely recommend this place.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116173651150473045/reviews
Sean Aaron Chong,5,"They have consistently maintained their QC all these years and still as delicious. Gyoza was perfectly pan fried with a golden crispy bottom.

The place can be a little warm tho especially after drinking the warm broth so just giving you folks a heads up.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107809966642363550343/reviews
WR X (Toujiang),2,"The ramen was truly outstanding, a testament to the chef's skill. However, the service experience was disappointing. Despite the restaurant's popularity, the staff seemed disengaged and uninterested. While I don't expect a luxury dining experience, basic courtesy and attentiveness are essential, especially considering the 10% service charge.

I could only see a little bit of customer service from the cashier and the awesome delivered food auntie.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106628219080086132384/reviews
