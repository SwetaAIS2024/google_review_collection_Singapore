Kaijie Goh,5,"The studio is amazing because of the instructors Justino, Ching and Kelvin who are knowledgeable, passionate and dedicated in bringing the best quality ballroom and latin classes to us. There are also many opportunities to improve our craft via competitions and performance exposure etc. Overall, it is also a conducive place with everyone being welcoming!! I really enjoy my time here. :)",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117682412260485536806/reviews
Vivienne Lee,5,"I have been learning latin dance from JCDA for many years, and I enjoy dancing there as it brings me happiness and at the same time release my stress from my school work. The teacher there is very patient in teaching and professional. The teacher taught me to be more confident, perseverance and prepare me from competition. I wasn‚Äôt confident in myself previously, after they taught me, I became more confident and trusting myself that I am able to reach my goal in competition. So, I do recommend people to come and learn, there is no age limit and you don‚Äôt have to worry that you have zero basics as they will teach you patiently.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108745943671089240590/reviews
Mia,5,"Teacher Ching is very detailed in her teaching. She focuses a lot on techniques to help students achieve stronger dance foundation. I‚Äôve been taking lessons with her to prepare for my competition and she has prepared me well, helping me to look more refined on the dance floor. She also hears my concerns on what I think I‚Äôm weak and want to improve eg my arms and arms styling and she finds the best ways to help. When I watch my practice or comps vid, I can see improvements. Will definitely recommend JCDA if you are looking for kind and patient coaches üëç",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108715751574438034709/reviews
emelyne sam,5,"Went to their Trial class on last week because I‚Äôm looking for dance studio that can guide me with my current dancing skills then Ching advice me to attend 1 of their standard intermediate level class (which is chargeable on reasonable rate) to try out and to get advice from the instructor in the end of the class, The Dance instructor gave us clear guidance and instructions during classes and the class is fun to follow with the fellow classmates is helpful & friendly and yes! Based on the lesson offered to my beginner friend during trial class .. JCDA beginner class is perfect for beginner students too. ‚ù§Ô∏è",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114267187463407224897/reviews
Jayne Tan,5,"Justino is by far one of the best, if not the best instructor I have had, in terms of clarity of instructions. He‚Äôs able to breakdown the steps and things like weight shift in an easy to understand way. I don‚Äôt get that from other instructors.
Always looking forward to attend his classes!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109960262277752092468/reviews
