Supposed that the bill should go to my account, but was told to pay before can do so. Why can't the club charge to my member account. Lucky a friend was there to pay. Otherwise they can't check out.\nwhy can't the club ask if charges goes to member account during booking? Or pay in advance before check in.",

      "text": "The Bungalow Chalet offers a cozy and charming retreat, perfect for those seeking a blend of comfort and nature. The chalets are typically well-equipped, featuring essential amenities such as kitchen, microwave, plates, water jug, utensils, pot and kettle. A notable downside is the lack of on-site food options. Guests have to travel far for a meal or have to prepare a lot of groceries for BBQ. It can be quite a hassle.",
