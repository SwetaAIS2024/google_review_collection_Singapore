Jing Kai Kevin Lim,4,"I tried the vegetarian truffle mushroom pasta, which I’d rate around 6.5-7. My colleagues ordered other dishes, but overall, the food was good too. The white coffee I had was also a 6—decent but nothing memorable.

What really stood out, however, was the bakery section. They have an impressive and wholesome range of options, leaving me spoilt for choice. The croissants, in particular, were a highlight—fluffy, crispy, and absolutely delightful. I’d give them a solid 8 and highly recommend them as a must-try!

Unfortunately, the presence of flies in the restaurant and even at the bakery display was a major downside. It was quite unpleasant, especially seeing a big fly roaming around the baked goods. This is something they seriously need to address to improve the overall experience",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107019201428872341790/reviews
Jesslyn Pratama,4,"The lamb tacro is good! The croissant is super flaky, super well seasoned, but the lamb is a little bit tough.

Hazelnut latte is very nice, but matcha is just average.

They also have a bakery too that sells unique pastries, so we bought some (pistachio cromboloni and spicy roll) and they taste just okay. Not bad, not good.

Would come back for the latte and lamb tacro!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107921207483882736933/reviews

CK Er,5,"Fantastic pastries, whether it is butter, chocolate, custard, cream or matcha.. the quality of the ingredients shine through. Not just the quality of the ingredients, the pastries are also generous with the good stuff.. for example the molten cheese lava pastry is more than 80% cheese. Super value for money. Above all, taste wise this won't be out of place in places like Melbourne or Paris",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101613060952862436431/reviews
