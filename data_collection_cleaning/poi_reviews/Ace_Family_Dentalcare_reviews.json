He has been the most friendly, cheerful dentist I have ever met who makes every dental experience not that scary for me! I appreciate how patient he is with me and often cracks cute jokes and even remember alot of details about his patients. Since appreciation for always giving wise advice and keep my teeth at their best condition! Kudos!",

      "text": "I am extremely pleased with the treatment and quality of service from Dr Tan and his staff on my dental procedures. I had an implant on my right lower jaw and an almost full upper jaw denture. The treatment took many months to complete and many visits to his practice. I must say that customer services and courtesy  were of the highest standard which I am very proud to acknowledge to him and his team. His reception staff were friendly and courteous and never fail to remind me of my appointments these few months. More importantly, Dr Tan was always on time with his appointment.. I am very happy to endorse Dr Tan and his staff to anyone looking  for a good and reliable dental surgeon. Thank you/David Lim",

She is a professional and caring doctor, she first did polishing for me and it wasn't pain at all, which i can feel the good result after the polishing. She is a patient doctor and she will answer to my concern and enquiries. Has been constantly looking for her to do polishing and fillings since then.",
