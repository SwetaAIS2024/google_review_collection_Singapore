Esther Li,5,"We highly recommend Dr. Gina! She is so good with children, very patient, and took the time to follow up with us when our toddler was ill. We appreciate how she doesn’t over medicate. All the nurses and staff here are friendly and helpful. Our toddler feels very at ease whenever we visit even when he is getting his vaccination.

*TIP: parking/drop off entrance is on ORCHARD SPRING LANE.

Average waiting time: 5-15 minutes on the weekdays.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110829865617247163181/reviews
Chase,2,"Doctor is great but the receptionist, love is not helpful at all.
I called and asked inquiry - while my child is in pain - wanted to see if there is any medicine for it. She said she will call back and she did - she asked me "" what is your inquiry""...so I had to repeat  the inquiry again and she told me to call back.
We are working and everyone is busy - and on top of it your child is in pain and trying to see if I could visit the clinic and solve the issue - and then this customer service.
Her voice was so robotic, low tone,  nothing friendly, sounded like she's bored with work or stressed, either way it was not a great customer service and felt I did not want to take my child to the clinic.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116831774896044528126/reviews

Fleur,5,"I love this clinic. I've been bringing my kids here for the past few years. The nurses are all friendly and efficient. We never have to wait long. It's so easy to make an appointment.
Dr Gina is one of my favourite people in Singapore. She is kind, answers all my questions, she didn't over prescribe medications and my kids are very comfortable with her.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117309762658814757371/reviews
Kerry Chan,5,"My son has been seeing the most excellent doctors at IMC Paediatrics since he was a baby. We left Singapore for several years, and then returned 8 years later and the staff is still kind, understanding and welcoming and if you need to see the doctor on the same day, they do what they can to ensure that your child is seen.

The doctors are knowledgeable, patient and friendly. We saw Dr. Shivani today and she was so attentive with my son and he wasn’t shy to speak to her. She explained everything clearly and explained her prescriptions clearly as well.

I never feel like my questions are unanswered here as the doctors always give me time to ask.

The nurses are all lovely and do a great job of distracting the children as they are having their jabs.

They bill directly to insurance which is extremely appreciated too.

Thank you so much for all that you all do!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112753520981931581900/reviews
