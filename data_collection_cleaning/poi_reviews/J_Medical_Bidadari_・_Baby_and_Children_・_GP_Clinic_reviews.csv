Veronica Tor,5,"Dr Jowell has been my son's primary doctor since birth. He is incredibly patient, always takes the time to answer my questions thoroughly, and never makes appointments feel rushed. His dedication and genuine concern for his patients truly set him apart. The clinic staff is also warm and welcoming, making each visit a pleasant experience. Highly recommend Dr Jowell for anyone looking for a compassionate and knowledgeable doctor!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103445661815220814758/reviews

XU WEN,5,"Doctor Jowell is very friendly and he knows how to interact with young kids. Was pretty surprise with his preparation when he needs to deal with young children. He got a dinosaur sticker for my 3 years old boy so that my boy is more comfortable and ready. It also help him to ease his stress and anxiety which is a very normal feeling we have when we need to see a doctor, but he take extra steps in helping the children not to feel stress and less worried.

He also gives very professional consultation and check on the patientâ€™s needs before he offer his opinion. He is also concerned about ours concern as a parent. He affirm us what we need to do and to avoid doing.
Thank you for the heart for your patient, we truly appreciate that!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114061808724459264055/reviews
