But I finally went.\n\nI think the broth is the most essential part of a bowl of laksa, but this was too watery and ruined the entire experience. I frankly don't understand why there's a queue for this standard of laksa. The other ingredients were as expected.",

      "text": "This decades-old hawker stall in Tanglin Halt Market draws snaking queues for its laksa, a recipe rumored to hail from the owner’s Peranakan roots. The broth is coconut-rich with a mild spice kick, generously topped with plump cockles, shredded chicken, tofu puffs, and fresh laksa leaves. Noodles strike a balance between springy and soft, and the overall flavor is comforting—though not revolutionary. Wait times can hit 30+ minutes during peak hours, testing patience for a bowl that’s satisfying but lacks the “wow” factor to justify the hype.\n\nThe no-frills stall operates in a nostalgic neighborhood hub, adding to its charm. While the laksa won’t dethrone Singapore’s top contenders, its reliability and heritage appeal make it a decent stop if you’re nearby. Pro tip: Visit mid-morning on weekdays to dodge crowds. A solid bowl for traditionalists, but temper expectations if queuing during peak hours.\nPrices are around $5-6 a bowl depending on ingredient combinations.",
