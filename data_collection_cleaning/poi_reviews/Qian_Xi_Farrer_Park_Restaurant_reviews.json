Salted egg prawns were de-shelled and the salted egg sauce was not strong enough.  Ceiling lights above my table seemed faulty as they shut off a few times for no reason, leading to false anticipation of the entrance of the wedding couple. My plate was replaced with clean ones 3 times for a 10 course meal.",

Fried Rice in Lotus Leaf\n8. Mango Sago\n\nThe food that i liked are the fish maw soup and brocolli with scallop.\n\nFried chicken was too salty, and the fried prawn with salted egg is bland - I can't really taste the salted egg.\n\nExcellent customer service. Staff is attentive to guests' needs and refills the glasses promptly.",
