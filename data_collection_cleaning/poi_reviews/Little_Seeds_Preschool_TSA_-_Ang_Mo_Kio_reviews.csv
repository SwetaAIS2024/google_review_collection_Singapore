lim lemel,5,"I put both of my children in Little Seeds AMK as I am confident with the school teachers and the school curriculum. I like the way the school conduct lessons, they allow kids to learn through exploration, this is important since children at the age of 2-6 years learn fastest through hands on activities. I would also like to say a BIG thank you to all the teachers in LSP AMK for all the support in educating the next generation!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109449621763835002415/reviews
