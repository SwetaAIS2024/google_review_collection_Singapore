Measly one piece of lettuce and a silver of tomato. For $20, I can easily get better burgers elsewhere even in coffeeshops.\n\nDecided to try out Pigsfly establishment since it's been at Katong for a long time so food should be good right? Wrong. Biggest mistake of my Friday night and what a waste of calories. Food took awhile to come as well.",

Sours the meal a bit when a casual burger night without alcohol is that expensive.\n\nI understand prices are going up and their landlord probably raised their rent to.\n\nBUT WE'RE NOT PAYING $71 FOR BURGERS AND LEMONADES!!!!\n\nThere has to be a breaking point where food is too expensive and we quit eating out. This $71 meal was our breaking point.\n\nEdit after reading their reply about using the freshest ingredients: I think what pushed this bill over the edge was the $9 lemonades.",

The burger just so tasty and juicy, cooked just right when you bite, it just melt in mouth:P\n\nHighly re-commanded for those who crave a good burger in Singapore!",
