Janelle T.,5,"Was introduced by my aunt a while back and decided to get a package of my own after a few sessions. My aunt recommended Joiey so I've only requested for her since. I purchased a facial package but she does a great job with my eyebrows and her massages are wonderful as well. Pleasant experience overall - apart from the good service, no hard-selling so far :p",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109076009786326617629/reviews
