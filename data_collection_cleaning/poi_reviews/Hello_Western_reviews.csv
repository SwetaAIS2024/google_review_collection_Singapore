D Yew,5,"As far as curry puffs go, this is my personal favorite. Due to the fairly constant volume, you're relatively assured of a piping hot puff. The pastry is both crispy along the edges and crumbly when you bite into it. The chicken puff is my favorite (haven't tried the sardine) and the filling is substantial and tasty, neither too salty or sweet like other brands. At $1.80, it's not the cheapest but you do get a lot of puff for the price.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115202752123298046466/reviews

New Gem💎: Mee Siam, My ❤️ ! 😘

Stall : Hello Western  (Halal stall)
Coffeeshop : 詹啡咖德美
@ blk 279 Bukit Batok East Ave 3.
S(650279).

This stall was mentioned as I drove my Boss , TKD 🥋 (5 Dan) : aka Senior Master, as I learnt more of TKD culture today …

As he also loves to eat, we have common hobby and thankfully he shared and I take action, to dine-in !

I ordered the Mee Siam @ $4.00 w/ extra chillies 🌶️ please 🙏🏻!

What’s so good 😊?
1. A Halal certified stall and manned by team of local/ PRC team of ladies !

2. it’s repertoire aplenty ranges from Mee Siam, Curry Puff, Huge Fishballs ⚽️ in skewers, Chicken Cubes in a bowl 🥣 , Deep Fried Chicken Wings + Chicken Drumsticks 🍗 + Fried Chicken pieces + Fried Popiah + YouTiao + Butterfly 🦋 dough + Hum Chin Beng + Burgers 🍔 too ! 😃😅

3. It’s Mee Siam was fantastic and Yummily delicious, spiciness at level 4/5, spicy enough to make me sweat 😅 like raining ☔️!

4. It’s Bee Hoon was aplenty and generous chives + slices of eggs spread out and gravy too !

5. Delightfully flavourful, a tinge of souriness as got Assam, sweetness due to a lite sugary, spiciness too ! That’s Sedap ! 😮 🤩 👍 ⭐️

Very satisfied with the Mee Siam, just wished my stomach can take more of the food … as it’s slowly digesting … 😅😜

Preview the unedited video clip 🎥 + photos collage to whet your imagination 💭!

Highly recommended to come to savoury the goodness of Mee Siam and their great repertoire of Food Choices ! I ❤️ their brightly lit stall, eyes 👀 popping and catchy too !

Cheers 🥂

Edward Wong,4,"Bought the following:
1. Mee siam $3.50. The gravy was flavourful - sour but yet very appetising. Sweetness was just right. Taupo was soft.
2. Butterfly $1.20. It was crispy on outside and slightly hard on the inside. Taste was good - fragrant and slightly sweet.
3. Youtiao $1.10. It was crispy on the outside but a bit hard on the inside. Taste ok.
4. Chicken curry puff $1.60. The skin was fluffy. The curry was flavourful and mild spicy.

Service was friendly and efficient. Be prepared to queue for the mee siam.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173188680901424865/reviews
HãpPŸ,3,"Saw many good reviews on this stall. I am a big fan of mee siam but unfortunately this mee siam didn't quite suit my taste bud. It's nice but not my kind of mee siam. Gravy is on the sweet side not tangy enough, a little light on the mee siam taste. The curry puff fillings is nice but the skin is very hard. The you tiao and popiah is very nice. Will try their western food next round",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100738228560182078848/reviews
Ben Sia,5,"I am really glad that I can see the revival of this store selling curry puffs, fried chicken and Mee Siam back into business after closed it's business for more than 3 years.

I like their curry puffs very much and not like the mechanical look of Old Chang Kee curry puff.

Even they uses machines to prepare the fillings and dough etc, the making process is still requires manpower. Maybe that's the selling point of this curry puffs.

Update on 29 July 2022:
I had order Mee Siam today and they still have the same taste as what they had before they went for break. Glad they can keep up the standard for Mee Siam!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106256605185450057490/reviews
