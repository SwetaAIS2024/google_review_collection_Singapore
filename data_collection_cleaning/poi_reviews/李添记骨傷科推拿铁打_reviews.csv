diana tan,5,"Sprained my ankle few days ago. Seen doc and was told it’s torn alignment. Nothing much can be done except auto recovery. And was asked to see orthopaedic.

Treated by the youngest one, and he is very skillful too.
Appreciate their skills a lot. Hard to find a good one like them. I was hesitate to go there as I know the waiting time is usually quite long. But it’s worthy.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115359278970428438437/reviews
Ivan Ooi,5,"Dropped by today to seek treatment for my lower back sprain which had occurred 5 days back.

Was treated by Young Physician Leong.
He did some diagnosis and explained to me the actual cause was not a sprain but rather ankle injury causing constriction.

He started the treatment which he applied to my ankle, knee and lower back.

Leong gave very specific suggestion post treatment to follow up while performing his treatment.

Indeed right after treatment I felt the strain relieved. But Leong cautioned the root cause of habit needs to be watched.

Overall treatment cost was $48 by cash payment which was reasonable as treatment was applied thru the ankle, knee to back.....with alot of medical plaster attached.

Ps: understood needed to call in to get number for treatment. Walk in subjected to crowd and available.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115504522260662038775/reviews
Gary Pak,5,"The treatment they give is very effective. Had sprained my neck and arm. Visit them in weekdays is a wise choice. Otherwise you may make an appointment in person and take a number from them. They don’t take any appointment over a phone call.

I felt better after few hours waiting and seeing the physician. Be prepared for a long wait though if you plan to visit them in weekends.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112249485964616889077/reviews
Benjamin Tan Yong Wei,5,The queue is worth waiting and their treatment is effective. At first I was skeptical about this when my mum introduced me. My frozen neck and dis-aligment of my arms and legs were solved. Tips you either go super early to queue or you go there early and take queue numbers for the late afternoon sessions.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106575743766869190379/reviews
