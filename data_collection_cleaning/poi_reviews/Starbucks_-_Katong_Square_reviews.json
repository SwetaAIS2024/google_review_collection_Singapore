It was so crowded and there are not enough spaces between seats. Staffs were nice and friendly. I couldnâ€™t find a Singapore mugs or cups or tumblers. Maybe there are many tourists come here so those Singapore designs were out of stock.",

      "text": "I like that this outlet is spacious and the male barista who's usually there is very friendly and chirpy. Food and drinks are standard Starbucks fare. However, as a person who has the ick for lizards, this place can be quite a nightmare. The few times I have been to this outlet, I've been greeted by a huge one at the table near the windows. In broad daylight too. At lunch today, it was rather busy, so I had to sit at the corner at the long table facing the wall and the amount of lizard droppings there was unbelievable. I almost gagged. Either nobody has been cleaning this up or the lizards are dropping it like it's hot faster than they can clean. Very unhygienic. I highly recommend the management to look into taking care of this problem. Honestly, this is the one thing which would prevent me from getting my cuppa there. No lizards please.",
