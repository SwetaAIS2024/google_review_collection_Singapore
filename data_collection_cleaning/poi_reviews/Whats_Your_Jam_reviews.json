      "text": "I've been with taking vocal and guitar lessons with What's Your Jam for almost 3 years. It's been a great learning journey. Hafiz is an awesome teacher - he's super knowledgeable, patient, and friendly. He's able to cater his teaching style to the student. When I struggled with a concept and didn't seem to get it, Hafiz continuously finds new ways to teach me until I got it. He's super technical and knowledgeable as well. Be it learning a new song or needing help to explore new music styles, Hafiz can play by ear and transpose automatically (not to mention across different instruments). This helps a lot when we change songs quickly or talk about a song holistically. His performing experience also helps add colour to the songs I want to learn/ performances or learning. If you are considering a music teacher who will work with your personalised goals, look no further. Hafiz is a great teacher and What's Your Jam is the best place!",

The studio is also cosy and inviting. I‚Äôd highly recommend What‚Äôs Your Jam if you are an adult who is looking to pick up and instrument for the first time.",
