Muhammad Nurhaikal,5,"Alhamdulillah for this mosque. Serves the Muslims working at Novena area. Decor inside is quite charming. Inspired by Balinese/Nusantara architecture, I believe. The mosque has two levels, though the second level was closed off when I was there for Zuhr prayers. Public parking is available at Revenue House, just a few mins walk away.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117247274329004802920/reviews

Sid Alami,1,"I went there to drop a Quran as I’m travelling overseas and I have other copies and the only way is to drop in a masjid.
Than the old man there told me that I need a permission to drop the Quran there which is wrong and anti dine m.
More then that I told him why I need permission to drop Quran in bayti allah with the other books.
He answered this is a private property.
Wrong again this is a masjid bayt allah.
It’s not private it belongs to god and the believers.
And I don’t need a permission to go in nor to drop a quran.
I think you guys should read more of the quran to understand what does mean Al yusr.
God bless you all.
Hope this help with deeper reflection and help change a bad way to do things.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100339036306022307548/reviews
