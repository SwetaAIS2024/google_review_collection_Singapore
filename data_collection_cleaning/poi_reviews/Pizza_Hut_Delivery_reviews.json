      "text": "Would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to Mr Abdullah.\n\nWe made an order through GrabFood which was routed to Beach road outlet. However, the grab driver delivered a completely different order to us (which that order was supposed to be FoodPanda, based on the attached receipt) appalled how the delivery guy didnt even bother to verify the order at any time. To our dismay, Grab and the delivery guy refused to respond to us which left my family at a loss. We decided to contact Pizzahut instead since Grab ghosted on us.\n\nThankfully, we are blessed to have Mr Abdullah who picked up the call and listened to our story patiently. He verified our order and swiftly arranged for a driver to dispatch our food which was delivered to us within 30minutes of the call.\n\nWe cannot express how amazed we are by this fine gentleman. He could had swerved the issue to Grab (since we ordered via that platform) and not entertain us, but he went above and beyond to help us rectify the problem immediately with such brilliant service recovery and attitude.\n\nKudos to Mr Abdullah. Thank you!",

He offered to send 2 pizzas as replacement. We received our replacement on 21 Mar and it was delicious and presentable. Abdullah has gone all the way out to ensure the replacement order was delivered in good condition and on time.  His service is  commendable and professional. Thank you.",
