Had mixed rice for lunch, was quite good. Coffee shop was airy with many stalls selling different varieties of cuisine. I'll be back to try other stalls soon.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews

I gave this caifan stall another chance because I genuinely enjoy the variety they offer and was willing to overlook the slightly erratic pricing. However, today’s experience left me confused and frustrated.

Take a look at the photo: I ordered 3 veg + 1 meat (which was tofu with minced meat), and the total came up to a surprising $6.50 — even with less rice, which I requested. When I asked the gentleman directly about the breakdown, he pointed to the tofu and beancurd skin and said, “这两个比较贵.” He then clarified: tofu was $2, beancurd skin $1.50. I still couldn’t understand how the total added up to $6.50, but despite asking further, he moved on to the next customer.

Best of all - my partner ordered 3 meat and 1 veg with normal sized rice and was charged $7.20 but the gentleman serving him said “$7.20 来我算你$7”.  Like how is this fair? That left a bad taste in my mouth, and I’ve decided this will be my last visit.

There seems to be new staff at the caifan stall. For better value and a more pleasant experience, I’d recommend the fishball noodles, roasted meats, fish soup, Chongqing noodles, zichar stall, or even the drinks stall instead. Unless you’re okay with mystery pricing, it’s probably best to skip the caifan.

Food is good but the caifan pricing is super anyhow. My friend ordered the exact same thing as me (with rice) and was charged $4.70 while I was charged $5.40 (without rice). Portion size for the ingredients was the same and the guy that served us was the same. I get inflation is hitting hard but this is some new level of discrimination or smth

Update 16/1:
My same friend went to get the exact same dishes WITH RICE, now served by another guy and it was $4.30 this is getting ridiculous",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102000936309686286516/reviews
Hong Huat Sim,4,"Great selection of food for a small coffee shop. Gets busy during lunch. Authentic Korean cuisine at affordable prices. The roast meat stall is surprising good!
