Ganesh is very exceptional, he is quick to problem solve, accountable, efficient and experienced. His partner Palani, is patient and a skillful driver, trust me, they could squeeze into the tightest parking lot with their 24ft lorry, highly recommend, will engage again for future moving be it personal or corporate.",

RK was my driver for my personal move where I transported a large number of balloons and he was very thorough in ensuring none of them popped. Overall very good experience with them and I would absolutely approach them again.",

I had contracted with another local service to move a small load of household goods from storage to my apartment but they did not show up.  Simply left me waiting with no van, no call, no show.   I called citywide and they had a van to me within 1 hour, with no advance booking.  It was lucky for me that they had a van and driver available.  I called 6 other local firms and they either refused outright or could only get a van to me hours or days later.  Citywide came through.  I will definately use them again and would highly recommend.",
