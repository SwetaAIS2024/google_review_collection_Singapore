He is more regulated now on average. He enjoys the sessions and requested to continue for the next year.  Thanks so much Teacher James and Nicole! I can sense your genuine passion and care for the children and families. Very much appreciated and we are very grateful!",

He also became more confident and less shy when interacting with others. Most importantly, he really enjoys his weekly Brainy Moves sessions!\n\nJames and Nicole are both passionate and dedicated professionals. They genuinely care about their students and their progress. I would definitely recommend Brainy Moves.\n\nCongratulations on Brainy Moves’ 10th anniversary! To many more good years!!",
