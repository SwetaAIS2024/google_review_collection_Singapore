William Lee,5,Probably one of the best Korean BBQ restaurants in SG! Love the beef and the banchan. We ordered the 2 pax beef set and it was wonderful! The Ganjang Gejanh banchan was incredible!

Simon Lew,5,"Our Valentine feast, moving away from our usual $1000 Omakase, we decided to venture into quality korean bbq, damage for this one is $300. Comparing to this to Hanjip, meat quality is comparable but this one has the seafood option, I prefer Hanjip cold noodles but Chang has a better Ginseng chicken soup. Chang has marinated crab which my wife love, beverage are better at Chang too. Good environment and service, without the time limit that Hanjip imposes. I guess Chang is now my goto for quality Kbbq.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106885172848578488465/reviews
