Brian Claus,4,"Not a luxurious lounge but definitely very comfortable and the food is good. Plentiful alcohol, soft drinks and coffee.
Even had almost real cheese :)
Comfortable chairs over looking the terminal giving ample opportunity to people watch.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100194968913569891982/reviews
Summer Pampo,4,"Blossom Lounge at Terminal 4 is a great spot to relax before a flight. The staff is super helpful and respectful, and I love the open space—it doesn’t feel cramped at all. The laksa is amazing, and while the food options are limited, everything tastes good.

The shower area is clean and has everything you need, which is a big plus. My only complaint is that the lighting could be better—it feels a bit dim in some areas.

Overall, it’s a solid lounge with good service and a chill vibe.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106836647801518941849/reviews
Yongkang He,4,"There're only two lounges at Terminal 4 with this one and the Cathay Pacific lounge. If you're not travelling on OneWorld airlines, most likely this is the one you can visit. For me  I'm travelling with Jetstar. My Qantas gold member got me free access. The food is all right cos I love laksa. The seating are all very good and I love it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114013787364096557398/reviews
Tan Samuel,5,"I had a pleasant experience at this airport lounge. The first thing I noticed was how clean and well-maintained the space was. It felt very welcoming and provided a calm atmosphere, which was perfect for relaxing before my flight. The seating was comfortable, with plenty of options to suit both solo travelers and groups. The staff were courteous and attentive, ensuring that everything was running smoothly.

However, the food selection was on the smaller side. While the options available were fresh and of good quality, I would have appreciated a bit more variety, especially for those with longer layovers. Perhaps a wider range of snacks or hot dishes could elevate the overall experience even further.

That said, the cleanliness, peaceful ambiance, and attentive service made it a worthwhile visit. I would definitely consider coming back, especially if there are improvements in the food offerings in the future.

Let me know if you’d like further refinements!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102111868362902423831/reviews
chew4s,2,"The worst lounge experience I had so far. While it was early morning around 2:30am, I am still expecting decent offerings but was left disappointed. Apart from the laksa which is prepared off the stove, the rest of the hot stations are room temperature. No more soup on offer besides the bread station and no cheese as well. Environment below eye level is decent, look up the ceiling and the upkeep is horrendous for a terminal of Changi calibre, a shame by Singapore standards!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113547157363819011368/reviews
