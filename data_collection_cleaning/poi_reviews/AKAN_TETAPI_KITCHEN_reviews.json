Ketupat was soft too.\n\nOtah was good, it wasn‚Äôt sweet.\n\nWanted to try their chicken rice but sadly it was sold out, had the mee goreng cutlet instead, it was spicy!\n\nThe lady boss was very friendly! She came to check on us once we were almost done.\n\nWould definitely come back for the satays! We tapao-ed 20 more sticks home.",
