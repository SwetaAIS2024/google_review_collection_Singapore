Faye Tan,5,"Master Potter Mr Lim is really skilful at his craft, from the wedging of the clay to throwing or handbuilding, all the way to glazing and most importantly,  firing of the works.
The place is homely, encouraging and conducive for beginners to learn at their owm pace, filled with laughter.
Amidst the fun, Mr and Mrs Lim are very serious in imparting their skills, spurring and challenging their students to think and experiment creatively.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110278158923317367112/reviews
Joela Zhang,5,"I wanted to deepen my skills in pottery and decided to continue learning handbuilding at Ceramic House. The course is very well-thought out and structured to help build up your skills in handbuilding techniques (which will translate to helping you when you progress to wheel-throwing).

Mr Lim is a great teacher who willingly shares his vast experience and knowledge with all his students; he is able to guide, correct and troubleshoot with you what went wrong. The wide variety of glazes (that he makes!) will leave you spoilt for choice for how best to bring out your piece.

Don’t forget to also check out Mrs Lim’s works: she’s incredibly skilled in making animals.

It’s a lovely environment as well, where it feels like studio members are all learning from one another even if we’re at different stages of our pottery journey.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113085552241430131554/reviews
