Hwee Shin,5,"First time here and Dr Fong served me. He is, unquestionably, the best dentist i ever had. He was sincere in his approach. He even took it on to himself to educate me to see dental care as something long-term rather than something that should occur whenever there is something to be fixed. For something as trivia as filling, he explained to me in great details on how to take care of it for years to come. He also told me what to tell other dentists to prevent misdiagnosis and damages to my teeth.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104820219116561523405/reviews
