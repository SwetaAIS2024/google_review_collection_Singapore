Ja Nu Pan Chyinyu,5,"First time trying Hai Nan beef noodle.

I went there around 1 pm and there wa no crowd.

Tried $7 with thick bee hoon.

The uncle who prepared the food is so kind.

The portion was good.

The sliced beef, beef ball, stomach & tendon were well cooked and tender.

The gravy was a little sweet for me but when I tried with lime & chili source, the taste became better.

One thing, if you are sensitive to smell, I would not recommend thia.

For me the overall experience was good.
I would definitely go again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113675968448805213645/reviews
Flo Yeow,5,"Quality of their beef noodles is high, but probably not something that I'll specially travel and visit, just to grab a bowl of. It's good, but not mind-blowing for me.

In this time and age, I appreciate the fact that they serve all the different beef tendons and parts of the cow, given that the preparations take a lot of effort, and it's extremely difficult to do it right.

We ordered the sliced beef, beef balls, stomach, and tendons dry beef noodles. I really like the bowl of soup, with the rich flavors and umami that it comes with. The only thing I didn't like as much of, was the thickness of the sauce; could perhaps enjoy the soup version of the noodles slightly better. That said, for 7 SGD, and the fact that it's award winning, you can't really complain.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Dennis check,4,"One of the very best traditional beef noodles we have in Singapore. The soup, the beef cooked to perfection. Very consistent since many years ago. Go in the morning to avoid the queue. Go for beef noodles dry with everything all in and ask for a big bowl soup to taste the sweet, savory beefy taste of the soup and the nice gravy on the noodles.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104765340207011638270/reviews
Violet Lum,4,"Beef noodles taste good but different from way back 40 years ago. Overall, worth trying after so many years.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117069903621220244873/reviews
