      "text": "I today visited Starbucks in railway mall and had an excellent experience thanks to Jonah. Even though the Starbucks app was down and I forgot to bring my physical card to use my rewards, Jonah was incredibly helpful. He tried his best to reboot the app, but unfortunately, we couldn't get it to work and had to purchase the drinks at regular price. Despite this, Jonah's professional and friendly attitude made the situation much more bearable. His dedication to providing great service was truly appreciated. Thank you, Jonah, for your outstanding professionalism!",
