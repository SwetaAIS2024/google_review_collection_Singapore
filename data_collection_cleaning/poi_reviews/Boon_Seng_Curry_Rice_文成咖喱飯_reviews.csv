Carmen L,5,"This is comfort food at its best. I usually order a $4.50 set with turmeric briyani rice (more curcumin with anti-inflammatory properties and low GI with high amylose:amylopectin ratio; what's there not to love?), onion egg, chicken chop and veg.

The onion egg is quite fragrant. The curry is gloopy and generously slathered on the rice - I mean, just look at how it clings onto the rice! For the veg, I recommend the potatoes which have a nice roasted taste (although I'm sure they're not!).

It's a one-man show with Uncle cooking and serving the food all by himself. Thank you uncle for keeping us satiated and happy!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113784368027194022523/reviews
Jasper koh,5,"Hidden gem right here.
Chinese uncle cooking up legit mutton briyani.

$6 super nice mutton briyani at Jalan Batu hawker centre. It comes with briyani rice, mutton, a veg of your choice and either onion egg or fried egg.
Rice is very fragrant, mutton is soft and tender. I chose eggplant and onion egg and totally enjoyed it.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103969433559486829987/reviews
