vivek anand,1,"Planning to stay at this condo? Heads up â€“ my motorbike was targeted in the supposedly secure multi-story car park. Accessories vanished, and cables were cut, leaving my motorbike a mess. It's disappointing to see this happen here, making it feel no safer than known theft hotspots like KSL. If you're living here, please be extra vigilant with your vehicles.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113741116821509857134/reviews
Junior Hsu,4,"To be actual this is not a hotel , so there will be no lobby for you to check in ,no room service. When you reach the suites building you will need to contact the staff who will bring the access card and key to you at the ground floor entrance  . The location wise is not convenient as eateries are less and most of the shops are vacant . You will need to drive out to eat , I don't know if getting private hired cars are possible as the district is far less than crowded .

The good point for this suite is that it's great for small family staycation if you are driving . The room layout which I stay is a twin queen size bed concept with kitchen , washing machine facilities .

The room is clean,tidy and neat . What I have to recommend is that the view when staying at high storey is magnificent. You can clearly see the west northern side of Singapore.

At the price of S$50+ through internet reservation and payment . This is a good choice for family stay.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109194187981877064256/reviews

Zeus Lee,4,"ðŸ“ŒPolite and friendly host.
ðŸ“ŒA very comfy and chilly place to stay. Most important is clean and tidy. Got Netflix to watch. Nice gym and swimming pool.
ðŸ“ŒA lot of nice view places around can take picture and check in.
ðŸ“ŒBut the problem is no convenient store nearby, perhaps I didn't find it. So have to buy mineral water before u staying in.

Definitely will come back again next timeðŸ˜Š",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116328874060254408107/reviews
Niddi Marki,5,"Check in at 27th floor. Very high and scared to stand at balcony. We have view of Singapore across the strait. Room is very tidy, clean and lemon fragrance. Will check in again in the future. Thanks to Stephanie, owner of this home.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106565907140287290441/reviews
