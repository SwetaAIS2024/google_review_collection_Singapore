SK Ho,5,"Very nice and tasty kaya toast.
Sardine puff skin was not crispy.  Could have been better if they were toasted hot before served.
Was crowded even on a weekday morning.
I am giving it a five star overall. I will go back again if i have a chance, to try other items.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106052152130933399046/reviews
Trotting Horse,4,"The popular Kaya bun is still very soft with their home made Kaya and tasty butter. Their soft boiled eggs are perfectly done where the white is runny white and the yolk is runny and creamy.

Dishes are average but good portion.

The staff is quick to clear the finished plates so that the table is uncluttered. Appreciate this gesture.

Overall enjoyable meal. ðŸ˜Š",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114960726223703734828/reviews
CP,4,"This old-school coffee shop has been a constant in my memory. Besides the marvellous CTE (Coffee, Toast, and Egg), I also like the local beehoon mee here with its comforting mix of luncheon meat, fried egg, and fried fish cake â€“ the perfect way to start the day.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
anggie,5,"The perfect place for a traditional breakfast set.
Amazing kaya toast (the bun was so soft and warm), the soft boiled eggs done perfectly, and fragrant, strong coffee.
Better come early especially on weekends, or there usually will be a long queue.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101182549993101966454/reviews
Bianca,5,"One of the best kaya toasts in SG. The bread was light and airy and the halfboiled egg tastes clean. My friend and I ate here 2x during our vacation coz we really loved the food. Egg plant in claypot is a must-try. We ordered the Small size but it was good for two people. The egg tart was also a hit with its creamy filling that doesnâ€™t feel like gelatin.

There were lots of tables inside and outside the restaurant. Queue is always long but fast-moving because food is served within 5-10mins after ordering. Just be prepared with cash since they donâ€™t accept card payment.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113147842681917258123/reviews
