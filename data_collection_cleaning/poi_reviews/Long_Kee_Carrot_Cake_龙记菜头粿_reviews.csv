Moses -,3,"Long Kee Carrot Cake, or as I like to call it, ""The Wild Card of Carrot Cakes!"" I ventured to Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 with the bold mission of trying out this peculiar delight. Now, let me tell you, this carrot cake isn't your average Joe - it's a culinary rollercoaster; you either love it or you're, well, wrong!

This dish is like a rebel in the world of carrot cakes. Forget everything you thought you knew about this classic comfort food. Long Kee's version is a culinary maverick. The taste is like a tightrope walk – a delicate balance between love and hate. If you're a risk-taker with your taste buds, this might just be your ticket to flavor paradise.

I, for one, am on Team Love. The distinct taste, while quirky, is quite the adventure. It's like a surprise party for your palate. You'll find yourself savoring every bite, wondering what unexpected flavor twist is coming next. It's like a delicious mystery novel you can eat.

So, if you're up for a foodie adventure and don't mind your carrot cake being a little rebellious, give Long Kee Carrot Cake a try. Who knew that a dish so simple could be so polarizing and so amusing? It's the perfect way to add some excitement to your culinary escapades!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113666852570724472966/reviews
Jonathan Wan,5,Long queue but worth the wait! This place uses its own fragrant Chili and fries their carrot cake in a unique way that’s unlike most Hawkers in Singapore. White version only but with a twist.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116275631681866898955/reviews
David Ng,5,"This is by far my favourite fried carrot cake stall that I've patronised for decades. It's just different from any other typical and regular carrot cake which I believe auntie has her secret recipe to it :) Eggs are generous, the way I like it. Just be prepared to queue for it, especially on weekends.

Update 2May22: pricing has increased across the board by 50cts which is evident across most hawkers due to increasing price in rae material. Still, Long Kee Carrot Cake still retain its top position as my favourite carrot cake :)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102408390521268644107/reviews
Victor Ng,2,You get the feeling the carrot cake was steamed and egg sauce poured over it. No “wok hey” or any sense that it had been fried. Disappointing!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115343125507441223772/reviews
