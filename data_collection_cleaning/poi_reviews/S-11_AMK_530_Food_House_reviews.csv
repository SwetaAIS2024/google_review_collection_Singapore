HK Tan,1,Popiah stall middle aged aunty extremely grumpy with bad attitude. My purchase was $2.20.  Gave her a $10 note plus a 20cent coin coz I have no smaller notes. She was very unhappy. I could see her tray of cash on her cash box with many small notes. I was the only customer at the stall then. Had been buying from this stall for many years. Very disappointed with the attitude. Guess the business is too good now and they can afford to chase away customers. Will not be back for sure.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105498732306248438482/reviews
Colin Tan,1,The steamboat zichar store serves very bad quality fish and the fish are not fresh and bitter. Worst fish steamboat I ever eat. We feedback that the fish is not fresh and we suspect they serve fish stomach meat instead . We tried it becos the famous one next door close down. Don't bother coming here and risk wasting money to eat bad fish.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115752968568040211577/reviews
Acctyp,2,"I left my shoe bag at the kopitiam last Saturday.

Today, when I went back to collect it, one of the F&B auntie at the counter “forced” me to buy a drink for the staff

I understand that leaving my shoes behind was my carelessness & my mistake, but I hv also contributed to the shop by spending money there.

* Moreover, the auntie even chose the drink herself and forced me to pay for it.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109262632187922625603/reviews
