So i went to sit inside and the malay lady at the counter right away told me ‚ÄúNot yet‚Äù when all i did was sit down because her other colleague told me to. I just told her, her colleague was the one who asked me to come in, and she then said ‚Äúok‚Äù. She went to another room, and told another colleague ‚Äúthere‚Äôs already a customer who went in herself and sat down, and i heard her colleague, who apparently is a chinese young lady, LET OUT A VERY BIG AND LOUD SIGH I was very offended at this behaviour bcs it really wasn‚Äôt my intention to ‚Äòhelp and sit myself in‚Äô. After the clinic officially open which was 4 mins later, another customer came right in, and the chinese lady attended to them FIRST and ignored my existence? I‚Äôm really taken aback with the standard of service here, and if it‚Äôs not bcs this is the only nearby clinic i could get to in the area, i will do my best to never come here again. Reading a few more bad reviews about the service at this clinic, i would highly advise the management to review their young staffs here. The chinese staff is Key Xin while malay staff i was referring to is khadijah. However, Dr Swee was extremely nice and professional.",
