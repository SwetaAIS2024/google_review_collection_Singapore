It's a little dilapidated.  We went to house of white bee hoon for dinner. The restaurant is still good with good food. There was a pub next door blasting live music of dubious quality. But hey it's a vibe I guess. So this place is a mixed bag",

      "text": "Overall dining atmosphere is good as it just beside the Punggol coastal fronting Pasir Gudang (Malaysia).\n\nFor the atmosphere.\n\nThe see-saw is, however pretty irritating to the diners due to the swinging mechanism screeching while in use.\n\nOrdering food is a challenge on a Saturday 7pm evening as the restaurant seems to be shortage of staff to take order ; one group of aunties to take main course order, one group of aunties + an uncle to take order for satay and another group of aunties to take order for drinks and desserts.\n\nThe food served is usual Restaurant standard ; nothing to call out but they have ‘Fire Show’ for some dishes whereby huge open flames are seen created by the waiter ; find it unnecessary as the diners will be stepping aside or away as the open flame is really HUGE !!\n\nPlus the aunty waitress will perform dances for some dishes too ….\n\nWe were placed outside the AC premise which is fine as we prefer proximity to the coastal and the weather is pretty cooling. The only issue is this is a common walkway and baby stroller and wheelchair will often hit diners’ plastic chairs as they commute.\n\nThe restaurant is Pets Friendly. Saw a few dogs.",
