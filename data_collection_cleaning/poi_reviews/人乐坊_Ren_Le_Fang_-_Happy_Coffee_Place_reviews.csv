Serene Ng,1,"Tldr; dont patronise unless willing to wait 30mins for toast or 40mins for a pancake.

Out of 6-ish tables only one was occupied, where their food has already been served.
I was the next customer and after payment i received my drinks immediately.
My coffee was bad and tasted like overburnt beans.
Soup options were not available, so was kaya butter toast. It was only 12+ at noon and i was left with other toast and pancakes option.
Settled with peanut butter toast and ham and cheese pancake eventually.
However the food took too darn long, new customers came and were also getting impatient waiting over 20mins on a single pancake. A couple eventually left without waiting for their food.

Half an hour later, the toast and eggs came, the taste was just mediocre and lukewarm.
Was sitting inside and the smoke spread so heavily throughout the cafe so i had to change seating to outside.
Finally after another 10mins i went inside to ask for the pancake, to which one of the staff just replied tonelessly 好了 (its ready) without an apology. Never bothered to look customer in the eye for interaction as well.
Pancake tastes normal, ham and egg and mayo in between a prata-like wrap.

True that they were understaffed but counter lady was also very unprofessional and seemingly impolite. There were 2 staffs manning the cafe and occasionally the ladyboss comes walking in and helps with the drinks before leaving again.
Hopefully they can improve their speed or their hospitality as a customer serving FnB cafe.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113122419163846230487/reviews
Wei Tan,4,"Cosy little cafe offering local favourites like toasts and eggs, pancakes and noodles at affordable prices. I really like the iced coffee on my first visit, but I realised on my subsequent visits that the taste lacks consistency. I've also tried the kaya toast, pancake and kimchi ramen so far, and I would say they're pretty satisfying (wife has been inspired by the kimchi ramen and wants to re-create it at home). Definitely a lovely corner to chill out with a book or two, if you happen to be in the area.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113727367121706943852/reviews
CK C,4,"A small cafe consisting of two indoor tables and maybe six tables outside. Environment was neat and clean with some nostalgia feel to it. I like that old-school crockeries were used to serve our orders. Prices were reasonable. Food was OK. The teh siu dai was well brewed. The peanut butter toast tasted stale though. Also, the bread used was not the thick ones pictured in the menu.

Overall, a good place for families, especially those with kids visiting PeopleUp.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews

Kai,4,"Pricing is reasonable. Food is average, convenient for a meal after a family outing to the nearby Bouncy Paradise. Indoor seating area is small - 1 x 4 seater + 2 x 2 seater tables only. A few other tables outside in a sheltered area.

Note that the serving of sides is quite small. $4.90 for a few pieces of onion rings…",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113885595031869775639/reviews
