There is limited seating and it was full constantly. I saw a lot of take out. Thank you for the good experience. The chicken and pork bulgogi were enjoyable. The chef is cranking it out from a super tiny kitchen!",

      "text": "There’s no service charge no GST but price is still around restaurant price. Kimbap set was $11.90, kimchi soup or soft tofu soup $15.80, there’s also noodles, other types of soup, stir fry dishes etc. menu is quite extensive.\n\nYou order at the cashier then pay before you get a seat. Friendly enough prompt service.\n\nThe area is just like a makeshift nook of the old Bukit Timah plaza mall. Not much atmosphere or particularly Korean feel except a tv screen showing some dramas.\n\nThe portion isn’t very big. The soup bowl is smaller size than the Korean one I usually go to downstairs. There’s also only 3 small banchan side dishes. All very salty, the soup also quite salty.\nMaybe if there’s more soup, it wouldn’t be quite so salty. The seafood is fresh enough.\nOne thing that’s well done is the rice. One of the better rice I’ve eaten at restaurants.\nI wouldn’t travel for this Korean food, is just ok ok but if I’m in the area and craving Korean with no other options, then I’ll try it again.",
