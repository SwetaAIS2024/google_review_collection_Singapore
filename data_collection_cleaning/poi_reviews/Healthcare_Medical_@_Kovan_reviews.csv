Gabriel Low,1,"Waited for 15min before I could even get my appointment and I was the only person looking for a doctor. The counter staff also cannot speak loudly and clearly, she kept asking for my ID and I do not know what she is asking for until the fifth time she said it.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112481596223056132193/reviews

Alice Lee,5,"Dr Angela Tan attended me this morning and she is very patient, gentle and helpful. As I needed a referral to see a specialist, she helped to ensure that I am consulting the specialist which is a panel from the insurance company.
The receptionist is also very helpful and friendly. She has to call several specialist clinics to ensure I got the correct specialist and helped to get their add for me.
Thank you for the kindness and this truly helps the patient to ease some of the burden and worries.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102173852641418044534/reviews
