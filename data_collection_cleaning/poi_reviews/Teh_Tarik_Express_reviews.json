I spotted a stall that offers Ginger tea without sugar and was eager to order it.\n\nAlas, the selection was finished for the day and a young angelic looking Ah Bang handed me a tea instead. Having sensed my disappointment, he gave me a pair of complimentary Dough Fritters to complement my tea.\n\nWow, talk about generosity & service... This is what F&B experience is all about. Highly recommendable & appreciated ðŸ˜Ž",

I did like their Banana Cheese Waffles, had it several times, I enjoyed it, though the service by the woman was always terribly slow. Just now, after waiting and waiting for it, it turned out she had spread chocolate on my banana cheese waffle and had the nerve to tell me she always put a bit of chocolate on waffle orders! I am allergic to chocolates. Have some consideration Teh Tarek staff, don't deviate from what your menu says and what customers expect.",
