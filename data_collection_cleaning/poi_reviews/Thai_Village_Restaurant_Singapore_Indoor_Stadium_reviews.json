      "text": "Amazing food and service!\n\nThe last time we dined here, the price was $60, but now it's $88—yet it’s absolutely worth it. Every dish was expertly prepared and bursting with flavor. Ms. Keng Huay provided exceptional service, and her team was incredibly attentive. Our tea was refilled promptly, and used plates were cleared quickly. We arrived before the Disney show started, and we didn’t regret a single moment. **We’ll definitely be back!**\n\n**P.S.** *Highly recommend the vermicelli crab*—don’t forget to scrape the bottom for the charred garlic and pork belly. So delicious!",

      "text": "Having the Shark's Fin here from SGD 60 till now is 88 already, but luckily the taste is still nice and the other food here is 99% always nice.\n\nOne time tried an abalone, dry one quite large but extremly expensive and not good... This time the smaller one tasted so nice and just cost around 50.\n\nThai Tofu is always my dad's favorite, but my favorite is the dessert 芋泥~ now is no more tooooo sweet and dry, very smooth.\n\nYesterday didn't order the Crab Vermicelli cuz just having the crab last week, but the Crab Vermicelli also very nice. Who loves the coriander & chili must give a try!!",
