      "text": "Choosing LPG for us was great. The teachers are really nice and make the children feel comfortable, at home and the sentiment of educating together our children is strong. The school is open to feedback and very approachable and admit when there is a problem.\nThe curriculum is well structured as a result my daughters are able to perfectly converse in French and English.  A variety of activities are also offered and the children are very happy. My daughter who graduated from K2 in June loves the school and still mentions that she misses it. “",

      "text": "Excellent bilingual (French/English) school on the East Coast. We sent our two daughters to LPG and they thrived during their time there. Their development and ability to communicate in French and English has been very pleasing. The strength of LPG is in the quality of their teachers, they are dedicated, passionate and approachable. The class sizes are small and the kids participate in a variety of activities. Our daughters enjoyed their time at LPG and we are fortunate that they had this opportunity.",

She’s singing new songs and demonstrates new skills at home like almost every week. Her French & English vocabs just kept on expanding. We really love the concept which focuses mainly on kid’s happiness and fun growth. Definitely our choice of school for our kind of parenting style.",
