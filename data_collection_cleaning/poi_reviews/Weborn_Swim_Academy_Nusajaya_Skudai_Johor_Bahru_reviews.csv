16 11,2,"This is based on my personal experience of sending my daughter so no judgement please. We attended 1 trial class and 2 official classes. Here's some feedback. First of all they make it mandatory for parents to enter with their child and then there's barely 2 coaches with almost 7-8 students of different age range. So you will need to seek for their attention to guide ur child to swim. If you are not proactive enough to ask then your child will be neglected. Unless, (not being racist) but if you're a Chinese then it's easier to get attention. The main coach still tries to divide attention to all but the assistant the younger boy sticks to being with other Chinese students. We are all paying the same amount but reality is harsh. When my daughter was hospitalised, they asked for mc as proof cause we can't attend but when they can't make it, they do not provide evidence but mereltly stating 'our coach has something to do' so we postpone. How is this fair? We have to a comply to them but they have upper rights to do what they want to. So what happens next is we decided to get a refund. Sorry that I sounded racist but this was our personal experience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107024352135888552060/reviews
