I've ordered from Hanifaa Frozen Food twice now, and both times have been a great experience. The meat is of excellent quality, and the service is straightforward and prompt. What I really appreciate is the pricing‚Äîit's very economical, especially when buying in bulk for 2-3 weeks' worth of protein. Highly recommend them for anyone looking for good quality meat at reasonable prices!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113285907679301775833/reviews
