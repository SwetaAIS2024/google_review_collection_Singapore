Arthur Cheong,5,Seen Dr Wong Sin Yew 3 times since 2014. He is my “go to doctor” when I am down after eating or in contact with something unknown. I recommended him to someone down with shingles and had the same good comments. A very effective and experienced doctor! Also a team of good staff there too.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106319964041647815497/reviews
Del Y.,5,"After a horrifying experience at Raffles Hospital,  i sought for a 2nd opinion with Dr Chuah Sai Wai, who promptly arranged the respective doctors and my admission to Gleneagles for my treatment.

Dr Wong Sin Yew was the doctor in charge for my liver, and his confident assurance when he first saw me for my condition was simply shining through. I felt in my heart, i was in good hands, finally & thankfully!

Throughout my hospitalization, Dr Wong never once made me felt afraid or instill unnecessary fear about my liver condition.
Every report that came back, he very confidently shares with me, what are the diagnosis and his plan treatment.
Absolutely removing any elements of worries and putting me at total ease.

After my discharge, he continued with outpatient treatments, sharing clearly on the goal of treatment | the medication required | length of time and the results we should be expecting. And Dr Wong is spot-on as based on each medical review after.

My hubby & i, is very thankful & grateful to  Dr Wong.
i was able to just focus on the recovery & healing.
His humorousness side always brings on laughter & there is always an air of reassuring calm that all is in order under his expertise care.

Dr Wong is a very well poised and confident doctor, in my heart.

My gratefulness & appreciation to Dr Wong & his team of lovely nurses for their kind dedicated care during this period of time, even during the festive season.

Extremely blessed to recovered well!
Thank you Dr Wong & team!
