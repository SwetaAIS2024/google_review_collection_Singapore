Ivan Michael Pung,5,"This noodle stall is primarily famous for their Sarawak 🇲🇾 Kolo Mee. Nested in the far east of Singapore, along Loyang Way, industrial park coffee shop, you will find Billy & Brothers Noodle stall.

Staff : Really just one guys…… The chef 🧑🏾‍🍳 himself takes the order, cooks and settle Grab delivery all by himself. He is polite and damn fast! A queue may form up but it will be cleared quickly.  He is pretty easy going and is happy to switch “item” if you don’t like or don’t eat them.

Food : Good! The Sarawak Kolo Mee 🍜 is Springy (aka QQ) and authentic. The sauce that he use is just right and not too oily. When stirred with the noodles, it gives off a perfect texture. The Lor Mee on the other hand is just …. Lor Mee at best. Nothing really special about it, does get clampy when it is cold. If you have only one shot at this stall, go for the Sarawak Kolo Mee $5.50.

Overall a satisfying meal to have in a local coffee shop. The prices are very reasonable 📉 and good.

Pro Tip : Go early…… lunch time can be very crowded, order a take away if you need and come back and get it later.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100551027047446956883/reviews
Princess Mania,3,"The $4.50 Sarawak kolo mee was decent with plenty of minced meat and vegetables.  The charsiew was abit disappointing though, meaty as it is, it didn't taste that fresh to me. Soup was flavourful. Overall enjoyed my noodle which is  decent for small eaters.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107320587807657797918/reviews
Bryan Tan,5,"Ordered Sarawak Kolo Mee ($5.50); added 2 fuzhou meatballs for $1.50. Total price $7..

Noodles cooked quite well, springy and absorbs the sauce too! Portion of minced meat is reasonable and tastes pretty alright; nothing too fancy, not the best kolo mee but tastes decent still. Overall portion for the noodles is reasonable for the price & ration of noodles to the sauce is just right. Would recommend if you’ve never tried it before!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106911212120550834163/reviews
Teck Boon,4,Lor mee is quite decent with the gravy not so starchy but still tasty. But since it’s not a dedicated lor mee stall it doesn’t have the more traditional fish flakes but they do make it up with other ingredients like a good amount of pork belly and nor hiang.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105978834231481267643/reviews
