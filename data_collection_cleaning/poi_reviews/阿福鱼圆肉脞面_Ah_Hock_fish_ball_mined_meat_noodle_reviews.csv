Sean Goh,4,"Happen to be running some errands nearby Frontier  building and decided to pop by for late breakfast. Chanced upon this stall inside the food court that sells fishball noodle with a queue. There were about 5 pax ahead of me when i was there. Apart from fishball noodle, they also sells laksa.

The noodle was nicely cooked, texture of the noodle was springy. The sauce was well balanced and goes really well. My bowl of noodle came with sliced fishcake,fishball,  liver, minced pork and fried wanton.

Overall, it an above average bowl of fishball noodle for me and would definitely recommend if you are nearby Frontier. Only downside if you ask me would be the portion of the noodle is quite little.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
