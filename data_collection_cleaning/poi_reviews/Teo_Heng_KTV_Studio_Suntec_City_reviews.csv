Calyssa Tan,5,"A go to place for my friends and I. Not only is the place affordable, the staff are great as well. Yan-jie who is always so friendly and welcoming. Would definitely recommend for anyone who is looking for a place to sing.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105200904078761082948/reviews
Glenn Ong,1,"There is definitely a serious piracy concern with the use of songs performed by cover artists rather than the original, licensed versions, downloaded from china websites and TVs, unauthorized romanized lyrics added to the original footages. You can rarely find the original, licensed versions of the songs now as they are overshadowed by the modified or pirated versions. This is destroying the music industry and a real shame to Singapore. I hope the authority is taking action on this before this is getting too far. Rightful compensation and apology should be made to the creative industry to retain our reputation to uphold the protection of intellectual property.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100724465248342455638/reviews

Trev,1,"Didn't know a legit karaoke place with many franchises can resort to such ways just to earn that extra few bucks.

Open bill was timed at 11.55pm , which means we could only sing for a maximum of 2 hours since this outlet closes at 2am. But upon checking receipt after payment, we got charged for an additional half hour but yet the staff didn't want to refund me back. Totally ridiculous.

Teo Heng, if this is how you train your staff, then everyone pls be extremely careful and check before making payment to see if ""additional costs"" are being added.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106567191843544221448/reviews
Lune Loh,5,"Me and my friends saw the dodgy photo of the entrance and I just told them ""why not"". In the end it was mostly lovely and we had a great time :)

(our only gripe is that we had a few minutes left, but the system wouldn't allow the last song to be queued to the very end)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106964904524406425754/reviews
