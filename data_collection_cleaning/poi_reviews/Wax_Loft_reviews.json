The space is clean, cozy, and private, and she talks you through everything so you know exactly what to expect. The waxing was quick, thorough, and way less painful than I imagined. If you’re looking for someone who makes you feel at ease while delivering great results, Jennifer is the one! Highly recommend!",

Honestly was doubting it at first as it is home-based but from the moment i stepped in till the end of the session, i was so comfortable that i forgot the pain! Very friendly and i had an enjoyable conversation with Jennifer. The service was meticulously fast, i felt so clean after! Even gave me recommendations on how to shape my half wax on my legs according to the dress that i had to wear for an event.  10/10 would recommend and i will definitely come back for more sessions!",
