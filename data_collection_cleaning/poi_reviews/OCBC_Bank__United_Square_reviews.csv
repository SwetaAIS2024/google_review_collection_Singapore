Adeline Yeo,5,"Arrived 20 mins to closing time expecting not to be served. But the lady at the counter was so kind and helpful in ensuring my transaction was done correctly despite my lack of familiarity. She even told me not to rush, and helped to fill in some forms. We were done in good time and the whole experience felt like privilege banking. The branch is full of books for adults and children which you can purchase, and has a relaxing feeling. Would definitely come here again if needed.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115673686977234102184/reviews
Jo On,1,"Came at 1140 am for picking up reserved notes . Was told by customer service lady new notes collection starts at 1230 . No number was given and at 1230 , 16 person in front of queue. She can do better by giving a number upfront . Was even told to go back office assuming same building. Only 2 person working at counter in peak period . Seriously not customer oriented .",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100393058271042870291/reviews

Dina Ishwarlal-Hueg,1,"Possibly the slowest sevice. I was told my wait would be 30 mins... looks like 3 hours wait 2 counters open and one customer being served for the last 40.mins
It's been over an hour 10.mins
This level of service is not acceptable
It seems like business account holder have to wait longer",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117922999361691984946/reviews
