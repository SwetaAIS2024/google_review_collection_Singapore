Leon Kwang,2,"Ok, for nasi lemak, you've got to get the rice üçö right. But it was wet/ soggy, and the lemak taste was lacking.

The fried chicken was ok, the extra portion of thigh meat we ordered was better fried/ cooked through than the drumstick üçó - which was crispy on outside but tight/ tough on the inside (under cooked).

Sambal was ok (not spectacular), but was important to help make this nasi lemak more palatable.

Not a fan.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews

Zhien Chua,5,Pleasantly surprised by this nasi lemak stall. They refried all the chicken and fish before serving. So everything was nice and crispy. The rice was very fluffy and really fragrant.  The Chili is really super good. Overall a good plate of nasi lemak. Will definitely be back here again,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109129687975637554828/reviews
Bylur Xu,5,"Good Nasi Lemak in a coffee shop environment. Was introduced to this place, and subsequently on the stall by a friend who stays in the area. The Nasi Lemak meal was reasonably priced and good but a touch of dryness. Wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to have it again if I‚Äôm in the area! :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100739939185962660240/reviews
