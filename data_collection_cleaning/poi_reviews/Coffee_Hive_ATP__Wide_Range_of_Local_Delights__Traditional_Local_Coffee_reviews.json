      "text": "I had a super unsatisfying lemongrass chicken set at this ATP outlet on 12/03/2025. The chicken was super tough and thin. Skimp on belacan. Requested for a little bit more then was asked to pay. The plastic cutlery from the outlet could barely cut the chicken. The chicken was definitely from the day before. Very bad experience. I told my colleagues to not patron this place anymore cos who knows what other food are from the day before. I did not take any photo cos I did not plan to post my negative review anyway.\n\nNow I am at the Square2 outlet, I saw other people eating very tempting lemongrass chicken so I ordered. Look at the lemongrass chicken here (see photo). Fresh and juicy. Generous belacan. Use proper cutlery that can cut the chicken without difficulty.\n\nChanged my mind about not posting review and immediately snapped this photo. Coffee Hive ATP, please buck up, otherwise you will lose more customers.",

      "text": "It‚Äôs a rather small unit run by a couple and the service time is rather long and unsystematic. Both of them are rather rude and there‚Äôs no service to speak about. The place smells of grease. Food wise, decent but recently it seems like the price has increased and it‚Äôs no surprise that it doesn‚Äôt appeal to the working crowd around the area anymore. There are also other coffee options like Lotus pastry around 50m away and Kopifellas.",
