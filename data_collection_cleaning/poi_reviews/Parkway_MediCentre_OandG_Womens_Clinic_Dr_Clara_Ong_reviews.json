What else does a patient need who is eagerly waiting to figure out what is happening to them?  It's not just Dr.Clara Ong. All the nurses assisting her are courteous and friendly, so with no second thoughts, I highly recommend visiting Dr. Clara Ong's clinic not just for pregnancy-related matters but also for all obstetrics and gynecology issues.",

      "text": "Avoid this Specialist all cost if possible. I was referred from GP to do further checkup today for a scope and in the end I was lectured for the whole session of not able to differentiate a scope and a scan of medical terms. If I am able to understand in layman terms I wouldn't be following up with a doctor. This specialist is rude and curt in her response throughout the session when I tried to ask further on some medical terms. Not to mention, her procedure skills is bad. She make me go through 45 min of procedure complaining I was tense and she is unable to scan properly but not realising her whole personality is curt. A normal procedure of 15 to 20 mins lasted 45 mins.\n\nI do not know where are the positive comments from, but this is not what I received from her poor attitude today.",
