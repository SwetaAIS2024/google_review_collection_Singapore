LP Pua,4,"Koo Kee Yong Tow Foo Mee is a well-established chain with numerous outlets. The quality of the food is good and remains fairly consistent across different locations. While it may not be exceptional, it is certainly above average. It is a reliable choice for those who are not overly particular about their food.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
LeongYan Yoong,4,"Always a consistent experience if you like Yong Tao Foo! Koo Kee‚Äôs stall in the Dover area which NUs students and ACS frequent. Prices increased now to $4.50 per bowl, but it‚Äôs a good breakfast or lunch option, so I do recommend the well made noodles and clear soup broth.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104961167743187290991/reviews
Alan Chan,2,This is the only worst Koo kee ytf that I have eaten so far. So far all other branches are good. This branch noodles is tasteless even with the minced meat. Soup also no taste. Only the ytf is decent. The cook seems quite sloppy hope I don‚Äôt get any food poisoning tonight,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110719132781492701972/reviews
Clare Chung,1,"Didn‚Äôt get to try the tasteless noodles because of tasteless service. Stood in line and waited for my turn and when it was my turn, aunty then decided to multi task (prolly a grab order) and started to mumble to herself when I was waiting for an answer to my questions. Oh and btw, apparently it‚Äôs an extra dollar to change the laksa noodles to their regular yellow noodles. Didn‚Äôt even catch what is the noodles in their laksa if it‚Äôs not their regular yellow noodles ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101035438704560938373/reviews
