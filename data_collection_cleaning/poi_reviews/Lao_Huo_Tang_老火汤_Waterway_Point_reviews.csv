j&c,1,"I am always a fan of Lao Huo Tang. Order at least once a week . Am seriously disappointed today! Was enjoying my ABC soup as was down with flu. Usually I may not take the potato but since today I am drinking soup without rice. And was utterly shocked to see the potato used in soup has turned ‘black’ . It’s not cheap for a soup at your restaurant, and am surprised the quality of the ingredient is not checked!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104949230389552664016/reviews
Jo Marissa,1,"Portions and quality of food has declined. The most ridiculous being the sliced fish dish which was totally different from what the menu shows. When the dish came, we were appalled to see just a whole bunch of onions to hide the fact that there were hardly any fish on the plate. When asked the staff, they simply said the kitchen has a weighted portion for the dish but couldn't tell me what the defined weight was. This is awfully unethical.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103288632111378150725/reviews
NICO CHEN,1,"We visited this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon at 4:30 PM. Despite being the only customers there, no dishes were served even by 4:55 PM—not even the ready-made soup. It was only after I started complaining about the slow service that a waiter offered to bring the soup, and the manager claimed they were waiting to serve all the dishes together. Seriously? Is this my first time here? The soup has always been served first on every other visit. This will be my last time coming to this place. I won't return to a restaurant with such terrible service. If I ever go again, it’ll definitely be to another branch.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111301865144799725253/reviews

Toh Bee Leng,3,"The dishes were quite nice. The soup can be refilled except the free Buddha Jumped Over the Wall. I do not know if the soup comes with unlimited refill.

I experienced what another diner mentioned. The first round of ABC soup was lukewarm but not the Lotus Root and Buddha Soup. As for the ABC soup refill, the temperature was warmer. The soups were hearty, flavourful but not salty. The crispy salted egg fish skin was delicious.

The staff was warm and friendly. She took the initiative to tell us that we could get a free choice of soup if we spent S$80 charged to an OCBC Card. With that, we ordered the complimentary Buddha Soup. However, top up of soup was not included. This staff is a gem because it added to my positive dining experience at Lao Huo Tang. The four of us spent S$25 each including taxes and service charge.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100499470448386442128/reviews
