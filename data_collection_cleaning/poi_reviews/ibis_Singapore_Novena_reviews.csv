Juvita M,4,"Overall, Ibis Singapore Novena is a pleasant place to stay. The receptionist was friendly, and both the check-in and check-out processes were smooth. However, communication during busy hours could be improved. I tried reaching out via phone and email to request a 30-minute late check-out, but didnâ€™t receive a response until shortly after I arrived back at the hotel, which made the return a bit rushed. With better responsiveness, the overall experience would have been even better.

One thing to note: the rooms are not very soundproof, so it might be less suitable for very light sleepers.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115797796363835288345/reviews
Yusuke Iwase,3,"Good rooms and bad rooms are clearly separated in this hotel.
Balestier road side has a nice view, but on the other side, there is no privacy at all due to the condos.
The building is old but well cleaned.
When we stayed at the hotel, there were many tourists from India staying there.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108391995438947452277/reviews

Sze Mei NG,4,"3-starred Hotel
26 February - 1 March 2025
- Location: 9 minutes walk uphill downhill from Novena MRT station.  Very close to bus stops (multiple bus routes) on Balestier road. Bus is better transportation. Different hospitals/health centres, shopping malls, and temples around this area. --- 7/10

- Lobby and common area: Small lobby as the old fixed structure of the building. There are only 4 chairs besides the big vase and the entrance. Old style of interior design. The corridor, carpet and wall are a bit old. --- 6.8/10

Front Desk Staff: nice, helpful, flexible, effective, polite, and welcoming. Early check is possible depending on the availability. We checked in at ~9:30 and got a room that someone had cancelled.  Arranged late checkout (12n -> 2pm) for us. --- 7.5/10

Facilities : Only one small restaurant  ""Oopen"" provides welcome  drinks, breakfast  buffet, and lunch (nice and efficient staff).  Fee Payable Self-help laundry on 10 floor. A water dispenser besides the lifts provides cold and hot water. Free WiFi. Free carparks--- 7/10

Room: 10/F with expansive street view only. Typical Singapore IBIS interior design. Larger and more comfortable than IBIS in Japan. Air-conditioned. Only heard some people moving (very low voices) in the corridor occasionally. More space for us to place our luggage than other ibis hotels.  No carpet, have a small area of water strain on the floor near the bathroom.
*Bathroom with towel racks and a hair dryer. The shower with a 3 in 1 showergel, sink, and toilet functioned well. Needed to take a shower carefully to avoid flooding or leaking.

Cristian Mapa,4,"As a member of the All Accor community, I always make it a point to book hotels within this group, thus during our family trip to Singapore, I booked in Ibis Singapore Novena. The room is reasonably enough or sufficient for a family of 3. Coffee and tea were provided and filtered water dispensers are provided on every floor which was really nice. The shower was also okay with dryer provided. Facilities wise, location wise, we loved it here. What maybe something that needs to be considered in the future is how ""friendly"" and ""accommodating"" the reception staff are. When we checked in, although it was in the middle of the night, the receptionist was not the friendliest. Working in a hospitality business would also require friendliness and should accommodate the guests well. Overall, we liked it (will probably book again if we ever visit Singapore). Though room is quite expensive (even more expensive that the rates in Europe, at least for Ibis level) but it's Singapore so it's a bit expected already.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108724982549014725797/reviews
