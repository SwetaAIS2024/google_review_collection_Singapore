However, even I am having a hard time singing praises of Maghain Aboth Synagogue. If not for a friendly french guide with a humble disposition, this rating would have been alot worse. I discovered this synagogue through SgFest and was directed to their website where I made my booking. Upon arrival, I was told to pass my IC to the guard, which i did so. They asked me to show them my email, which i also did so. I passed my phone to their security, and while scrolling the mail, the mail was sent accidentally to my spam mail. That was when all my woes started. They said that I did not show them the mail and demanded to see it again. At this time, I did not know it was sent to my spam mail. After checking every folder in 2 google email accounts, I finally found the ticket in my spam mail. In total, I had to surrender my IC twice, had my pouch(with a powerbank) checked twice. In the process of surrendering my IC, my wad of dollar bills fell out of my wallet. After collecting my composure and completing the compulsory paperwork, I told the security that things were disorganized and disorderly here. I was told if I did not like it, I could leave. Seriously? What kind of hospitality is this you are showing to your guests? I actually took up the guard's challenge and headed to the exit where the guard stopped me and asked me to proceed on. You could visit any religious place of worship in Singapore and not be treated in this disrespectful manner. Very poor hospitality on Maghain Aboth Synagogue on their part. The only saving grace is their guide who spoke English with great clarity. However, I did not learn much about the Jewish community during this visit as I was totally pissed off."", 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': ""As a Singaporean, I try not to give places of interest bad ratings to promote Singapore's tourism scene.
