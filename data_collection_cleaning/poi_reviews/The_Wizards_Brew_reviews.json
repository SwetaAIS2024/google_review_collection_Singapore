      "text": "Store is located on the 3rd floor in a quaint corner. Wayfinding Guide is also available on their instagram page; which was very helpful in a location with many shops like Chinatown. Before entering the store, the decorations already start on the outside, welcoming patrons into the world of wizarding magic. The biggest plus point of The Wizard's Brew is definitely the attention to detail to their environment & decorations (+ the ability to borrow some wands & cloaks!) For potterheads out there, the atmosphere is one that you will enjoy. Staff were also nice & friendly.\n\nF&B wise, its definitely on the pricier end as it is also a themed bar. If finances are of concern, you may also have a look at the prices on their website beforehand if you wish to make a more informed decision on what to order - it is pretty transparent; the pricies seen on their menu there is the same on-site. There is no GST, only svc charge. We ordered 2 specialty drinks (phoenix fire & the wizards brew) & 2 specialty desserts (tiramisu & baby root). I enjoyed the presentations of the food & drinks (as seen in the photos) Personally liked the taste of Baby Root a little more than the tiramisu (the cake was yummy & spongy!) but the baby root itself can be quite a hard piece of chocolate (something to note for people who arent able bite into harder pieces of food)\nOverall was a pleasant experience. If you are a food connoisseur, do manage your expectations as I would not say that it is the store's greatest strength. However, if you are looking for a place to escape to another realm with a couple of friends, it may just be the place for you!",

I can only recommend it. We had a great evening here. You even can wear cloaks from your favorite house if you want to.",

      "text": "10/10 for the super-fun Potter-themed atmosphere, complete with wizard hats and robes which you can don for that complete magical experience. Applauded the detail that went into the decorations, and the fun of every drink and dish, complete with instructions, magical incantations and lots of spectacular fire. Service was also very friendly and warm! However, the taste of the drinks and food were not great, and probably a bit pricey (though probably worth it for all the effects and fun!). Desserts tasted better. Go for the fun, but donâ€™t expect much from the menu.",
