theguy_withstuff,4,"I had chicken rice at this stall in a coffee shop and honestly, it isn‚Äôt that particularly different from any other place. The soup was definitely steaming hot which is great at least. The chicken rice itself isn‚Äôt notable in that it‚Äôs just your basic chicken rice dish. I do like how cheap the prices are since it was only $4 for the dish, helps that the environment is also clean and tidy. Overall, good chicken rice but not much to note.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112628164904019834073/reviews

Leonard Lim,4,"The char siu is very good for the price and outshines the roast pork. Lovely caramelized dark bits give the bitter sweet smokey  contrast to the flavorful tender char siu either melt in the mouth fat.
Good value for money. üëç
The coffeeshop is a little messy and could be cleaner.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116867245896657547975/reviews
Seow HT,5,"Hidden gem in the neighbourhood!
Chanced upon this coffee shop diagonally opposite Le Quest. Saw that the roasted meat stall has a queue so i ordered from roasted dang gui duck (their signature) and roasted pork. Hubby ordered char siew rice. They were all tasty, especially the duck. Meat tender and moist with the sauce, pork skin crispy and crunchy. Rice is fragrant

Went back there again yesterday evening to try the roasted chicken, not disappointed as well. Value for money (2 meats combo cost less than $5, probably slightly more for combo with duck which is understandable), they are not stingy with the portion. Highly recommended!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102302391564382262392/reviews
Waffles Xiao,4,"Pretty good roast meat for hawker, peeked in and saw duck is indeed cooked using charcoal. Don‚Äôt really taste anything difference when eating tho.

The crisp of the duck skin is quite uneven though, some parts overly crispy and some under but meat wise is really soft and fatty. Charsiew and roast pork is good too",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108295932080486085875/reviews
