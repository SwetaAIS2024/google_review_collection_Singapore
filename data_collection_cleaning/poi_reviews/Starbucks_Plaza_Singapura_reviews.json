When I mention to the staff, no apologies was made and they never even offer tissues or whatever for me to clean up. Although they asked if I wanted to remake but then it does not change the fact that it already sprayed all over my clothes. I am not even sure if I can wash this off!!!\n\nthe photo of the lid was taken after the incident happened.",

Ordered the usual stuff that I’ll order at Starbucks and as usual, the food standard was good and the coffee as expected.\n\nThis outlets seems to be packed most of the time and it was no exception this time when I visited. But good thing is that this branch is relatively big so it wasn’t difficult for me to get seats.",
