Kaebin,5,"Hidden gem in Eco Bonatic especially if you like Si Chuan food. This restaurant was closed for almost 2 years and now that they reopened, the food tasted better than before.

My personal favourites are their ""Ma Po To Fu"" 麻婆豆腐 and cabbage 手撕包菜。""Salted vegetable fish"" 酸菜鱼 is pretty nice too and they are one of the few places around here with Qing Dao Beer 青岛啤酒.

Haven't get to try all their dishes cause I usually pick those few favourites.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113979687592715676244/reviews

Mrvictor Ang,1,"The food is rather pricey, it’s below expectations. We ordered the sweet and sour pork loin and the the portion is very pathetic. Taste wise is very average. I would not recommend anyone to eat at this place. Any other food place at eco botanic would win this eatery hands down. Please don’t get cheated here.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112084752648078854588/reviews
