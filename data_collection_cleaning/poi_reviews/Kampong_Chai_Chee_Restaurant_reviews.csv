Reno Kreuz,5,"Had our break fast here and while the food came slightly later, and one of the dishes was wrong, the service was warm and excellent. They were kind and apologetic, and decided to give us that wrong dish free of charge for us to break fast first. The food was also very good, especially enjoyed the fried chicken, crispy and meaty. Would love to come here again after ramadan!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111193643920272605575/reviews
Muhammad Yasser,2,"Called in to order a takeaway during dinner. Food was mediocre but service was great and staff was patient. However, was shocked at the portion of the Lemon Chicken (small).

yung unagi,1,"Came to venue and was first greeted with “after order waiting time 40-45 mins” and walked off to served drinks to customers.

Only 3 staff were working. 1 server and 2 chefs. Literally only 3 staff working. Multiple tables were not cleaned up after previous customers.

Benefit of the doubt, we ordered $18 (Large) size for cockles. Received a medium plate cockles. Cockles were bland and tasteless. Cockles overboiled that when it cooled down, it’s super super dry (as seen in picture) not juicy at all.

Ordered lemon chicken rice. Served white rice with a pool of watery lemon sauce and not fresh bartered chicken. Chicken was dry and cold and not crispy. Most importantly, lemon chicken rice was served on a  large steamed fish kinda plate (as seen in picture). Lemon chicken was transferred out a normal plate that was given to thrown the cockles shells.

Seafood fried rice was bland and to sum it up, food is overpriced for the quality and standard that was given. Basically, most of the ala carte such as seafood, beef, chicken, prawn or squid is $18 (small serving) and above.

Saving those who wants to eat cockles and seafood to save your money and eat somewhere else. With that price, you deserve a better quality of food and service.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100574773357763887121/reviews
