Annette TH Lim,5,"My first time visiting here as I saw they have quite many brands of good medicine here! Highly recommended too as itâ€™s open during Sunday morning, which some places we needed to see doctor on the weekend but most of the clinic is closed. Guess I have found my newly favorite clinic here! Thank you Dr Tan & team. ðŸ˜Š",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105944117968468222361/reviews
Shammir Karasu,5,"This is my 2nd time visiting this clinic since I moved here 8 or 9 years ago. I was pleasantly surprised. Dr Tan Wee Chuan is a pleasure to speak to. He shows concern, explains clearly the possible issues and shares the different medical interventions I can consider. My wife swears by the clinic and I have never thought much about it. But I do know now why. Kudos to Dr Tan and team! I guess I have found a new family doctor!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106013340855287702769/reviews
