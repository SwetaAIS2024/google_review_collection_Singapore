Pearlyn GYT,5,"Very affordable western food in a cosy neighbourhood coffee shop. A huge plate of tender chicken chop with garlic rice for $5.80 was really value-for money.

It is evident why there is a queue for this especially during dinner time.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105538956700519868571/reviews
Blackraven,5,"Very good western food at reasonable price! Highly recommend the chicken chop rice $5.80 which was perfectly done! But when I asked for extra gravy for my rice, I was turned down. Well I can accept that itâ€™s a bonus if I could have my way! Will try the other dishes next time.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114385515451710838076/reviews
Stanley,4,"Very nice decent old-fashion type western food served here. Their portion are pretty generous, take a look at the chicken cutlet size, it was huge. Meat was tender and soft, crispy and crunchy. Their spring chicken was of similar quality, tender, crispy, and not oily too. It's value for money, definitely must try and worth the queue.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109779294020772182875/reviews
Cat T,5,"$5.50 western food (garlic fried) rice sets that taste good and also filling. We eat here almost weekly. Recent favourite is half spring chicken set.
Chicken chop has a salty starchy sauce  which I don't like, so just scrap ot off...
Usually need to wait at least 10mins.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115501602868899713032/reviews
Jeremy Tan,5,Have been eating at this stall for years. They recently increased prices by about $0.30 so chicken chop is $5.80 now but it is still one of the cheapest around and very good value for money because it comes with fried rice and fries. The chicken chop is the thin type but I prefer this over the thick kind.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108061092719554443193/reviews
