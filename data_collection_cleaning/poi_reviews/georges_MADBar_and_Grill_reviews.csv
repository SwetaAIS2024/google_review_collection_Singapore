Stella A,5,"Had the Georgeâ€™s cop-the-lot Burgerâ€¦ nicely charred and flavorful burger patty, crispy bacon and a side of crunchy French fries. A well stacked burger! ðŸ˜‹
Brioche buns were a bit too crispy and it was falling apart with each bite so it ended up a bit messy. But no less yummy.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115553574204363396681/reviews
KORIN,5,"Been there 3 times, always cozy and chill.
Love their speed of service, and their price range for alcohol, with or without happy hour are still as good.
Sports bar ambience, many TV at different spots, got you covered for the sports match pleasure.
The food are pretty decent, the crispy pork belly is better on quiet day, havenâ€™t tasted food thatâ€™s really impressionable.
Definitely will go back for a chill glass of beer especially during sports season.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104589426688720081775/reviews
win win cabbage,5,"A Taste of Italy: Alio e Olio
Alio e olio, a simple yet elegant Italian pasta dish, is a testament to the power of quality ingredients and skilled preparation. This classic dish features al dente pasta tossed in a fragrant garlic-infused olive oil sauce, often enhanced with red pepper flakes for a touch of heat.
The beauty of alio e olio lies in its simplicity. The key to a truly exceptional dish is the quality of the olive oil, the freshness of the garlic, and the perfect cooking time for the pasta. When executed correctly, the result is a harmonious blend of flavors and textures that will leave you wanting more.
Whether you're a seasoned home cook or a pasta enthusiast, alio e olio is a dish that is both satisfying and easy to prepare. It's a versatile dish that can be customized with various ingredients, such as chili flakes, herbs, or grated cheese.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104561859506628774030/reviews

John Tango,5,"2025 Apr update : boy the Georgesâ€™ cop the lot burger was really good. The difference is the fries which were 10/10; crisper & still soft on the inside, tasty too even without the sauces. Highly recommend to try at least once. We ordered ours without cheese. They can add a fried egg on request at a minor cost.

Also 10/10 was the fried squid head. Awesome & addictive. Not for those with weak teeth though generally soft and the batter is nice & crisp.

2024 Jan update : Georges burger awesome bacon burger & crispy fries; mine without cheese â€¦ mayo & ketchup ðŸ˜‹ New pictures uploaded.

2022/May/06 update. The Banger & Mash recipe has changed since my last review. It is good. A repeat for sure. Topped with thin young asparagus, mushroom & halves cherry tomatoes at bottom with mash potatoes. Sausage is not the cheesy ones. Sliced into two pieces. See picture.

2020/Jul/18 Saturday evening.

Ordered the combo with pork chop & cheese sausage.
