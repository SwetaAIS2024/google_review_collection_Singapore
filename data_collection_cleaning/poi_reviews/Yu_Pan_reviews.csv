Ojisan “Hiroshi”,4,"Seems like this place has been around for at least 5 years based on the oldest review (which reviewed the wrong stall).

Understanding their 招聘面does not come with egg, I brought my own and realized they won’t cook for me. But nonetheless I add my raw egg into my bowl as they poured the boiling soup into it (problem solved).

Noodles dry can be with dark sauce or the usual ketchup, chilli and vinegar.

招聘面 $5.50
Soup was good 4/5
My Mee Pok was a bit overcooked 3/5
Sauce for noodle was very normal 3/5

Fishball is the standard bouncy type 4/5
Fish fritters was interesting for me as I’m still trying to figure out if it’s a hit or miss.

But I love the pork slices and minced pork 5/5 as the were very tender and nicely velvet.

Overall can eat, not bad.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112623517876975514039/reviews
Max S.,5,Standards are almost the same as the branch at fulushou. Overall a nice hearty bowl of soup with generous portions of ingredients. ($5.50 with rice) I love that they always have bitter gourd and that crispy brown thing is absolutely delicious!,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101834880193042109600/reviews

Ronnie Tan,1,"I am a regular customer. Just 15 minutes. Saturday 14 Oct. 2023. There were two staffs at the stall.I was the only customer at that moment in times. I ordered a pack of dried fine noodle with dark sauce take away. My grandchild tasted and there was chill sauce added on. I requested for dark sauce only. I think, the staffs were not attentive and half awake. Is dried noodle with chill sauces a norm in Singapore locally ?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111561082523413126623/reviews
Ming Huey Lim,1,"Quality of the food has dropped drastically over the years, not to mention there are dishonest staff within who either overcharged the customer or intentionally ‘forgot’ to inform the chef after I have paid additional $6 to add fish and pork slices for my mom. Returned home to see no fish at all and only 2 slices of pork 🤦🏻‍♀️ Not the first time, previously decided to let it pass as it was such a hassle to drive back, park the car and get back a few dollars, but today was the last straw! Returned to get back $6. Not because I am stingy but I rather donate to people in need than to be cheated. Lack of integrity is the reason why I am not returning to the stall. Hopefully they don’t prey on the old folks.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111814508015264421925/reviews
