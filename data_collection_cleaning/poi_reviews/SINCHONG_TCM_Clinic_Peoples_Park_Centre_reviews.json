I received treatment by\nTCM Physician Lin Chih Chiang, to my surprise, he actually cured it. My stiffness gone almost right away.\n\nI was so impressed, glad the soreness was gone and I'm able to have a long awaited good night sleep!\n\nThank you very much! üôè",

And an appointment/administration system that doesn't work.\n\nEven with an appointment made in advance, you need to wait for 1 hour. It is as though it is on a first come first serve basis. And packing of medicine takes bloody forever\n\nThey give out queue numbers, and the bell rings, but there isn't a board showing the numbers?! It is purely for the counter staff to see, who will then shout out the names.",
