Robert Kosan,4,"This place has a good QC for the taste of their dishes. Pig trotter was tender, soup was delicious.  Unfortunately, this is the second time that I find pig fur, yes, pig hair.  It's just they don't care much lately about the cleaning before cooking.  Too bad.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105467760252286982403/reviews
Chris L,5,"The best pork leg rice in Singapore! With tender juicy pork leg, and fresh coriander, braised egg and peanuts, braised tofu and white pepper soup make it a perfect match! Never ever try the No.2 super duper hot chilli if you can't bear the spiciness! ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
P/s: But we love the No.2 chilli so much! ðŸ¤£",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104085463248704050054/reviews
Andrew Lan,5,"Good food need reviews! Had kway chap. It's a huge mofo bowl brimming with flavour. The soup has probably a dozen ingredients - incl garlic cloves, white radish and clams. Served with crispy taukee, pork skin, intestine and tender meat. I just about licked the bowl clean.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101327065772656168114/reviews
Jeffrey Ng,3,"Heard some reviews on this stall, since nearby, drop in to try the Thai braised pork knuckle rice, it was well braised with peanuts, tau pork, eggs and a bowl of the radish soup,  not so authentic thai, but, a good plate of the braised pork rice for lunch ðŸ˜€",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114912616060377319836/reviews
Spice N' Pans,5,"Their pork trotters are packed with flavour and come in a generous portionâ€”just $5.50 for one person, served with rice. Their Thai kway chap is also highly recommended, with meaty chunks of braised pork trotters. We always come here when weâ€™re craving a delicious braised pork dish!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117490901465936089819/reviews
