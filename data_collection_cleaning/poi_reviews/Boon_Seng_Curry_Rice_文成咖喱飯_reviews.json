      "text": "This is comfort food at its best. I usually order a $4.50 set with turmeric briyani rice (more curcumin with anti-inflammatory properties and low GI with high amylose:amylopectin ratio; what's there not to love?), onion egg, chicken chop and veg.\n\nThe onion egg is quite fragrant. The curry is gloopy and generously slathered on the rice - I mean, just look at how it clings onto the rice! For the veg, I recommend the potatoes which have a nice roasted taste (although I'm sure they're not!).\n\nIt's a one-man show with Uncle cooking and serving the food all by himself. Thank you uncle for keeping us satiated and happy!",
