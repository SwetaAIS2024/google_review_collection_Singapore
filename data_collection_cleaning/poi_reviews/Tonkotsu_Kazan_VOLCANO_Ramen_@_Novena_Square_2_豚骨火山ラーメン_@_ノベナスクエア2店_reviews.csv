Doraemon,5,"I had been to Tonkotsu Kazan Volcano Ramen once before and found the food to be decent.  So I decided to bring Kitty to try it, knowing she enjoys a good bowl of ramen.  We went to the location in Novena Square 2.

We were blown away by the unique ""volcano ramen"" experience.  We ordered the Ishiyaki Ramen and a Garlic Butter Fried Rice.  Both were served in sizzling hot stone bowls, which kept the food hot throughout our dining experience.  Kitty particularly liked the Garlic Butter Fried Rice, saying it was very nice. We also loved the way the server cooked the egg right in front of us and mixed it into the rice.

When the Ishiyaki Ramen arrived, the server poured the soup right in front of us, creating a dramatic ""eruption"" effect. It was so visually impressive, and the ramen was incredibly flavorful.  The broth was rich and savoury, and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  The portions were incredibly generous, too. More over it's paired with a bowl of rice.

We also took advantage of their all day happy hour and enjoyed two Sapporo beers for only $2.90 each.  They even offer free iced lemon tea for members, which is a nice bonus.  And to top it off, they have a free flow of hard-boiled eggs, which was a delightful surprise.

The restaurant is lively, casual, and themed, with a definite Japanese flair. It's a fun and energetic place, perfect for a quick and enjoyable meal. The decor is simple and functional, with a collage of vintage Japanese movie posters on the ceiling, adding to the overall theme.  We especially liked the Mount Fuji mural.

Overall, we had a fantastic experience at Tonkotsu Kazan Volcano Ramen. The food was delicious, the service was great, and the ""volcano ramen"" experience is definitely worth trying.  We'll definitely be back to try other items on the menu.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112665277904119154671/reviews

Beary Beary,5,"Great Soup in Generous Portions

Came in for lunch on a weekday. Had the Volcano that came with noodles and rice.

The meal came in piping hot with a fire below the bowl. The broth was amazing - rich and flavourful but also not overly thick. There was adequate vegetables and meat in the soup together with the noodles. The rice really was too much for me so I shared it with someone else. But the soup went very well with the rice as well. Boiled eggs are complimentary - a really nice touch !

The place is pretty crowded at lunch time with a small queue perpetually at the entrance during lunch. Turnover is quite fast so the wait in the queue is usually not too long. ",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101788329090998743221/reviews

Cat N,5,"I recently discovered this gem of a Japanese restaurant, and I'm so glad I did! The food here is delicious, and I've already become a fan.

The beef don is a must-try - the beef is tender and flavorful, and the portion is generous. I also had the volcano beef soup, which was rich and savory. The broth was piping hot, and the beef was cooked to perfection.

What really impressed me, though, was the little touches that showed the restaurant's attention to detail. For example, they offer free hard-boiled eggs to customers, which is a lovely surprise.

The staff here are also friendly and attentive. They're always happy to answer questions.

The only downside is that the restaurant is quite small, which means there's often a queue. However, the wait is well worth it.

Overall, I'm happy with this Japanese restaurant, and I'll be back for more. I recommend this store.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116341048858805323273/reviews
