Xoom Too,5,"I’ve visited this FairPrice quite a few times throughout the last 5+ years and I’ve always been around the area and needed a water bottle or a little snack but everytime it’s been a pleasant experience. They’ve also got self-service cashiers.

The FairPrice is located on the lowest floor of Chinatown Point next to a Subway and a food court. The FairPrice is a decent size with it’s meat, fish, vegetable, fruit, candy, snacks, alcohol, beverages, other normal food items sections. Sometimes there are good discounts for certain items as well. Aisles are clean and organized, staff are friendly and help you when you’re looking for something, etc.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105863133358477079886/reviews
Ivan Tan,4,"It’s a nice supermarket to go as it’s not usually crowded and could walk in peace. Some items i discovered that are worth to buy like this pocket tissues and drinks as shown in the pictures. If you happen to be around here today or tomorrow, could get these items at a good price too. Not often you could get a bottled drink for 80 cents these days. Go buy since it’s not very expensive compared to the other bottled drinks you see on the shelves.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105865784747329427413/reviews
K L,3,"I saw the pre-packed tomatoes in the photo today and wanted to buy a packet but the weighing machine didn’t have a sticker label for this. I asked the elderly female short haired staff member wearing glasses who manned the self check-out kiosk area at 17-04-2025 10:00pm how to check out the item, showing her this photo. She just replied “I don’t know, all the time we sell tomatoes by weight, you just have to weigh the packet.”  I explained to her that the weighted price for that packet would be S$2.50 but she couldn’t be bothered and said “then I also can’t help you”. I then suggested her to take down the price label to not mislead other customers if they don’t intend to sell the packed tomatoes at that price. She replied “Wait for my colleague to do it tomorrow”. Duh. It was a total waste of my time to talk to this woman. FairPrice management, hire people who are more qualified, responsible and motivated to do their work please.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100431246668780254563/reviews
Rudy 林,5,"FairPrice at Chinatown Point is convenient, It’s got everything — fresh fruits, veggies, snacks, and even some international stuff. The place is pretty spacious, so shopping doesn’t feel too cramped. Plus, they have self-checkout if in a rush. Perfect spot to grab groceries after work or while exploring Chinatown.
