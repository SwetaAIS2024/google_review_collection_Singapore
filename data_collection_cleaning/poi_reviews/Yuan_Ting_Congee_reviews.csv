Yee Chin,1,"I had a really unpleasant experience at this porridge stall recently. What happened was after I ordered my food, I asked the elderly man who was preparing the porridge how much it would cost. He didn’t respond, so I asked again, this time a bit louder, thinking he hadn’t heard me. To my surprise, he responded in a loud, rude and sarcastic manner, “Hey miss! I am cooking! can you wait!”

His tone was uncalled for and left me feeling uncomfortable and unwelcome. While the food might have been decent, the way I was treated completely ruined my experience. It’s unfortunate because good service can really make a difference, but I won’t be returning due to the rude behavior I’ve encountered.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117553183920254009290/reviews

Raff Goh,2,"Order was taken by a man in front of the stall and conveyed to the female cook in the stall. She was glued to her phone on social media for a good 30 seconds to a minute  before she put down her phone. And she then asked order to be repeated.
Terrible attitude.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105788040369805904381/reviews
