The sauce they put in doesn’t complement well especially the red sauce that looks and tasted like a salsa which is weird because it’s supposed to be a Turkish dish not Mexican. Definitely not authentic shawarma! The baklava is decent.\nService was quite confusing in a way that you don’t know who is really the server.\nNot the best place to go if looking for good shawarma and pricing is also ex considering the food and service they serve.",
