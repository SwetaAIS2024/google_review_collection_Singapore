J M,5,"There is a bicycle clinic for free for the public, every Sunday 3-4pm. You will meet very friendly people like Patrick, Daniel and even Freddie who will provide basic maintenance for the bikes. They are volunteers and make themselves available for whoever is in need of a bicycle fix!
I also dropped in for a chat at times!
A shoutout to them, ""Thanks for giving my bicycle a new life!""",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108651786106489623353/reviews
