The room design is very nice including walls and windows (forest)
Makes us relaxing 😌
Amenities including soaps are eco friendly.

Clarise .Chee,1,Due to department event got to stay for a night. Recommend if you plan to not to rest for the whole night.  The nature noise will keep you from falling into deep sleep. Need to have big heart to prepare for the sudden animals wake up call. Be prepare to be a non-enviromental friendly person if not you can enjoy free sauna in the your room. The bed is also super comfortable and big compare to standard if you believe so. Anyway don't plan to have a good night rest if only you able to knock yourself out by some other mean.😏,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114566258336642049630/reviews
Jenny Lau,1,"1. The cleanliness needs significant improvement.

2. Due to the humidity, the floor feels sticky and damp, making it uncomfortable to walk barefoot. I recommend providing disposable slippers for guests if you prefer they don’t enter with shoes on.

3. The place has a natural vibe – you can hear birds in the morning and insects at night. However, it’s hard to rest or sleep because the peacock’s calls are so loud they wake you up, and you can also hear people playing with go-karts past midnight. I suggest setting limits on activity times to avoid disturbing guests, as it feels like we're paying to be inconvenienced and torture ourselves.

4. It’s not close to the city center, and it’s not cheap to stay here. All the activities require additional fees, so if you're not interested in participating, it can be quite boring . You’ll need to come up with your own entertainment. If you’re interested in the activities (which you can find on their website), you may want to consider staying elsewhere and driving here, as there are no special discount for overnight guests, and you won’t be able to get a good night’s sleep.

Ohya, no fridge inside the chalet and no BBQ facility too.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114845065180669924915/reviews
cylene,5,"stayed here for a night with my family on the way in from sg via tuas. it’s nicer than expected with a relaxing cabin concept!! the reception closes at 7PM but they gave my dad instructions on how to check in which was a nice touch 😃😃 it was clean & had a newly renovated vibe. kinda tiny but it was cosy!!

would definitely stay here again, with some things to note for incoming guests:

❌ wifi, hairdryer, fridge
✅ shampoo, body soap, heater, aircon, TV",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108793651578511818786/reviews
Seren Phang,1,If there is zero star I would definitely give zero or negative. Anyone who want to go and stay or relax avoid this X Chalet @ Sunway Iskandar. Think thrice. Filthy and disgusting.Waste money,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115702507085635008655/reviews
