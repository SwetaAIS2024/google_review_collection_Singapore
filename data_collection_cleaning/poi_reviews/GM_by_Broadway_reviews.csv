Esmond Gabriel,1,"Very bad service. Visited today ( 29 March around 5pm plus) wanted to buy buns at the drink stall, the younger guy and older drink maker can pretend not to hear me and ignore. Come on, if they think that selling bun is beneath them, then go work in some top restaurants. By the way, the food there aren't fantastic too, going there because there was a heavy downpour.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102542813230187404967/reviews

Xin Yi Steph,5,"One of the aunty at the drinks stall makes great toast! She put in effort to toast and make it nice but she's off on Thursday!
