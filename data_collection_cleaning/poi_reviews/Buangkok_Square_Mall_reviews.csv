Ronald Lee,5,Located along buangkok crescent and provides necessary amenities which is really meant for the neighborhood as this place is quite remote from everywhere. I hope more crowd will start to pack and support the business. It is always nice to have a mall around the neighborhood given more option and selection thereafter.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103500949946638796359/reviews
Gecko Chua,4,"Buangkok Square Mall was opened in the beginning of the year 2019, it served the residents, especially the Buangkok Crescent residents, as it is the only Mall around here.
Although it is just a two storey building but you have a Prime supermarket where the residents can do their groceries and you have a Koufu Foodcourt and other stall selling western food like pizza, a confectionery shop, a children playground a malay stall selling mainly Halal products, etc
Just outside the building there is also a McDonald fast food restaurant.
Just last year Oct 2020, a new bus loop service 114 was introduced and it commence its journey from Sengkang Central at the bus stop outside Exit B of Buangkok MRT Station and this bus will stop at a bus stop opposite Buangkok Square Mall.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102735410756160124167/reviews
