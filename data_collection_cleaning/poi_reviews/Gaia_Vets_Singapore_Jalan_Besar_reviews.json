The staff here have been nothing short of accommodating and professional in what they do. They are able to work well, even when the vet clinic gets busy and my birds have received the best attention and care from the working staff here. They never fail to update on the birds health and always check-in on their well fare after prescribing medications.",

Tara has undergone two major surgeries and has always received the best care each time.\n\nWe couldn‚Äôt ask for a more dedicated and compassionate team to look after her.

      "text": "My dog injured his leg and Gaia was able to see him right away. On the phone, I was told what to expect and potential fees involved, but some of those fees were voluntary depending on what I wanted for my dog. The vet was very thorough, explaining why he is having issues, why he might have future issues, and what options we have to help him, laying out a course of action if he gets worse. We chose not to do anything invasive and the vet never pushed us at all or try to upsell us. She was awesome! The receptionists were also very cool. Later in the week, they contacted me to see how my dog was doing. Never had a vet do that before for  a non emergency case. Price is extremely reasonable. Keep doing what you are doing, Gaia!",

And the teams were all empathetic and supportive.\n\nAs for price, I find them the most reasonable\nJust for benchmark:\nTwice I brought them to both to another vet.\nFor the same issue, Pudding‚Äôs bill was $250 at Gaia but bill was $900 at another vet.\nFor the same treatment when Gaia was closed due to relocating , Peanut‚Äôs weekly treatment was $240 at another vet , while it is $105 at Gaia.\n\nBottom of my heart, a big shout out to the team. Every single doctor, assistant and front desk team & Felicia‚Äôs cheerleader smile. ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù\n\nI finally have the courage and mood to write this. After mourning Peanut‚Äôs passing.\nThank you for being there for us over the years.",
