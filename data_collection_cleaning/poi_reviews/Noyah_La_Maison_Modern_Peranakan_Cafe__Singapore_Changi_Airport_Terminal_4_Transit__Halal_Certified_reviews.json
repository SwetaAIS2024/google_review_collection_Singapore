The curry chicken is the most palatable among all the dishes ordered. The beef rendang is tough and the pasta has no flavours at all.\n\nOverall, the food really needs to improve.",

      "text": "I got beef rendang at 4am. I had the same thing a year ago. Its as good as I remembered it to be, if not even better. The egg was wondrously runny and the beef was plastic-fork tender. The achar was flavourful and had the right amount of acidity. All for a decent price, you get to have a meal that's easily better than what you can order on any flight of Changi, taste-wise. I look forward to coming to Terminal 4 for this place and its great food.",

Too lazy to go up the second floor for the food court and my gate is near there so no point going to the furthest f&b outlets at the end of the gates.  Shocked that the butter sugar toast Coast ne sgd7.20! The tea is decent but shock milo cost sgd1 more. The toast is decent with good butter and sugar spreading. The soft boiled eggs are decent. Just can't accept the fact it is so ex! But it is airside of the airport. Limited choices, expensive place, what to do.",

The rice is kinda of soggy, abit like glutinous rice texture feel. The Acar is not sweet or sour too, just very average meal. Good enough to fill your stomach for a quick meal.",
