Cindy Chua,4,"I 1st met Dr. Daniel Tan Jiadong on 11 Dec 2024 at Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic. Being a new care-giver, I have to ensure my health is in good condition and upon hearing I have some issues, he has patiently checked and explained it well to clear my concern/fear. Hence discussion and suggestion were recommended and met. 3 months later, my visit with him is equally a pleasant one. I am really glad to have met him who is polite, understanding and is open for discussions and is very accomodating too. Taking this opportunity,  I would like to wish him great success in his career. Kudos to him. He makes a good doctor. Keep up it!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109268505072200608601/reviews

Wendy Lee,2,"I came to register for my Q number, at the Q kiosk there, I've asked the auntie short hair wearing spect who name Sherry about the blood test , which level I should go to? She told me got level 3,4,5 ? I've told her that I came here to have a blood test before my doctor review me... Then she repeated again level 3,4,5? I told her was it normally I see doctor the level is the same level for blood test? She felt very pek chek and tsk sound , see my Q receipt and ah, ah ...she was very rude if I know which level, I won't be asking her right? 😡 Is it the right attitude toward patients? & I've told her (thank you)🙄",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116648146143150062754/reviews
Siebel Tan,1,"I went to see doctor consultation on 11 April afternoon as I was having some sore throat on that day, The doctor examined me that day is Dr. Mun Tuck LEE, after JUST checking my throat and ask me some simple questions like how long have this started?. do I have other things to tell him?…vvthen he just tell me everything ok already and I can leave.
Then when I asked for the mc he was REALLY RUDELY ask me WHY DO I NEED IT…WITH A SMIRk LIKE WHAT I JUST ASKED HIM IS SOUND RIDICULOUS TO HIM OR SOMETHING
So I told him that I need it to provide to my school as I was absent that day due to my sore throat and I don’t want to spread to me school mate, I could have just ask my parent to write a parent letter but I decided to go to see doctor alone cus I also need some medicine
AFTER EXPLAINING WHY I NEED THAT MC,
He seem unhappy and ASK ME MORE QUESTIONS :vvAbout my school, my age, where I came from do I do well in school so I need to explain to him again that I’m already 18 and through out the consultation I believe that I behave well , I nocked the door, greet him and close the door after greeting, I’M PROUDLY SAY THAT I’M MATURE AND POLITE ENOUGH TO SHOW THAT I’M A GOOD STUDENT because after have to explain all that stuff to him he told me that it’s because he saw on the computer it’s not the only time I went to see doctor while said it in a *SARCASM* way

Sorry like I thought he was joking for real… it’s only been 4 times that I went to see a doctor in this year INCLUDING THAT DAY and he said like I’m a bad student trying to escaping from school so I need to get a MC from him
Again If I’m that bad I wouldn’t even care to get a mc so I don’t get why he assume every students go see doctor more than one is the bad one

After all I just wanna say I feel really upset, disappointed and I been treated in a really disrespectful way
Hope everyone will not face the same thing like me.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106237116675231959593/reviews
Chris,1,"Unthoughtful queuing system
1) If you missed the “temperature” queue, your Q number is not displayed under “missed queue” display screen. And the staff there also don’t bother to call out the missed queue number. Until the patients who came before me already seen a doctor and I still did not. Went to check with the temperature checking staff then she say, “ I already called your number, you missed it”.
2) Both kiosks for medication collection are hidden behind some walls, and unless you specifically walk around to find it. Its is hardly noticeable. On the day, both kiosks were spoiled. There’s a small card on the screen that says go to the reception. Again, if you are not a “regular” in AMK polyclinic. You are going to miss it and waste your time waiting for your queue number to be called.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118015230221505519604/reviews
