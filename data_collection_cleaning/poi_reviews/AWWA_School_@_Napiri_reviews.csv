Gabriel Kwek,5,"AWWA is a voluntary welfare organization that provides services from infants to seniors, particularly for groups with increased health and social care needs such as persons with disabilities and caregivers.

With a wide variety of forward-looking programmes and services such as Kindle Garden (inclusive preschool), early intervention centres, AWWA school for students with special needs, community integration and low vision service for mainstream students with disabilities, post-18 personal care and caregiver programmes, senior activity and dementia care centres etc, it is poised to celebrate diversity while problem-solving challenges hand-in-hand with the different population groups it serves.

For the public, AWWA has a resource and training centre that provides interesting courses for different conditions and caregiver needs, and its own resource library and toy library is definitely worth a visit to explore some very useful information through books and toys!

This place is also fully accessible for wheelchair users or parents with prams! üòâ",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103041500099542034816/reviews
