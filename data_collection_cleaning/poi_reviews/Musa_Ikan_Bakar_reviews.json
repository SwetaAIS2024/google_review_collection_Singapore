Pricing it certainly a little high at 90c cents each, but it is great that lamb and daging options are priced same as ayam.\n\nThe wait was not too long - approximately 15 minutes for a less crowded evening. The satay came nice and hot with a fair portion of cucumber and onion. I found the satay ayam to be flavourful and of great consistency. However, satay daging was too tough. The flavour was good though.\n\nWhilst I was not too disappointed, I certainly wish the quality was a little more consistent.",

      "text": "There are many satay stalls at the Lagoon. Decided to give this a try to compare against some others I have tried before. Ordered the chicken and beef satay and at 90 cents, its one of the cheapest around. Verdict? As good as the few other stalls in Lagoon. Exceptional? No but certainly above average. This is the sweeter version. The meat was well marinated, flavourful and tender enough, with the slight char that makes satay so delish. Prefers the chicken over the beef as the beef is slightly tougher. I prefer mine on the tenderer side. Peanut gravy is the thicker and grainier version, well spiced without being overly hot, which speaks to me! Will drop by if I'm around the neighbourhood, but will not make a special trip down. Similar to all the satay stalls I have tried at the Lagoon.",
