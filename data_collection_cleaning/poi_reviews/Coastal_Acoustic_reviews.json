      "text": "A solid spot for casual drinks with friends or colleagues after work. I’ve been here a couple of times and always had a pleasant time. The bar is spacious, so it never feels too crowded, and there’s a relaxed vibe that’s perfect for unwinding.\n\nHappy hours are a nice bonus, and they have live music on Fridays and Saturdays which adds to the atmosphere. Drinks are reasonably priced, and there’s a good selection to choose from.\n\nFood-wise, it’s not the main attraction – best to stick to the basics if you're feeling peckish. One odd thing to note: there’s no in-house toilet, so you’ll need to use the mall’s restroom on the second floor, which can be a bit inconvenient, especially for the ladies.\n\nAll in all, it’s a great place to chill with friends, enjoy some music, and grab a drink or two without breaking the bank.",

This was the only restaurant open in Orto Mall for lunch (opposite Haw Paw Villa). The service provided by the staff is excellent, super efficient and attentive. The food service was very fast as well.",
