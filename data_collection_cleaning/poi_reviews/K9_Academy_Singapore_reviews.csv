Joyce Naidu,5,Awesome and very experience trainers. Joe is able to identify the issue ... Sometimes it's not the furkid but the pawrent. We had our furkid undergo Board and train with Joe and HB. Not only we had fun our furkid had successfully graduated and now our bond with our furkid is so strong and listens to our commands. Kudos to Joe and HB. Thank you for your patience with us and not giving up on us. Thank you,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107233830983224499320/reviews
