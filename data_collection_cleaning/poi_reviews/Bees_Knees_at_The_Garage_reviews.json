Outdoor seating for those with pets. Cafe is clean and I appreciated the fans, shade and open space. Not a wide selection on the menu but should be enough.",

They didn't act very fast to put all the customer in. Could have been faster and more efficient.\n\nWe ordered a spaghetti and kids meal chicken Bolognese. Aside from missing the kids meal Everything is quite normal.\n\nWas going to give a poor review but when we ate the dessert for kids chocolate mousse, we were stunned. This was one of the best chocolate mousse we had in our lives. The temperature is just right一not too cold for kid and it taste delightfully sweet. Not overboard. The texture is rich.  It's not like a ice cream it kinda feels like a cake. It's really amazing. Everyone should try it\n\nAll in all not bad!  P.s forgot to take pic of kids meal but anywayit's average",

We love the texture of the pasta and the beef was very tender.\nAs someone who barely eats carbonara I was pleasantly surprised, the carbonara wasn’t too gelat which made it an easy to eat, although the truffle flavour could be more prominent.\nChicken mayo pizza was pretty good, gets a little heavy towards the end bc of the mayo.\nWorth a try for a special dinner or date night.",

The place is kept cool with lots of fans and good place to chill out if the weather isn't too hot. I like my eggs Benedict with ham. The ham is thick and succulent. Perfect with the buns and eggs for a savoury breakfast.",

Food was very delicious and fairly priced, we enjoyed particularly the seafood pizza. Service was also excellent - helpful, pleasant servers who made the experience better. Would highly recommend to folks to drop by while at the Botanic Gardens",
