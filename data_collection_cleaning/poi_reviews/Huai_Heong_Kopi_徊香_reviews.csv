Michelle Koh,5,"Food taste good,  the curry for curry chicken noodle is separated when you takeaway. I was looking for nasilemak around this area, very decent. Ordered for take away with 3 mains + 1 sides + 2 beverage and fries. 1 of the main + sides + beverages + fries came within 10mins. Then I waited for another 10mins and ask how about the 2 remaining main dish which didn't come. Then they bring it out to me after a few minutes.

Not sure how their system work for takeaway. Nonetheless, worth to give it a try. Dine in customer does not have issues.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113005302051880474302/reviews
Priscilla M,5,"Had breakfast here, and it was such a gem! The ambiance was just perfectâ€”super cozy, with an aesthetic that brings you back to the old-school kopitiam days. It felt nostalgic.

Ordered the nasi lemak with fried chicken (perfectly fried, not too oily, and the chili was spot-on), char kway teow, and roti canai with curry chicken. Everything was delicious! The staff were welcoming and friendly, making the experience even better.

For the quality of food, ambiance, and service, the prices were reasonable. Will come back again in the future.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110984877378826675134/reviews
Patricia Yip,5,Tried the Ipoh shredded chicken hor fun and it is exceptionally good. Have not tried those in Ipoh but this exceeded what I had tried so far. Far far better than the one from Oriental Kopi! The pricing here is reasonable too! Service is excellent!

Calvin Taylor,3,Overrated chicken floss horfun. The soup has a very thin taste of shrimp. The shredded chicken is kinda mussy. Coffee is also average. Convenient place to have breakfast staying in Sunway area.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107772706275502882376/reviews
S Law,5,"We always come back here for local breakfast whenever we are in JB. Great tasting signature dry fried bee Hoon, Kaya butter space bun, roti canai with chicken curry. Of course must also order their hot fragrant Kopi O and Kopi C. Delicious breakfast for 6 people cost MYR130, decent pricing. Nice Kopi tiam atmosphere and friendly service. Highly recommended. #breakfastJB #JBfood",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117634223302075240385/reviews
