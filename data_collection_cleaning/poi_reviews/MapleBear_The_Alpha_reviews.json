The facilities were always clean. The teachers were kind and caring. My son liked the foods being served. There were lots of fun and memorable school activities throughout the year. I highly recommend this school.",

      "text": "I was looking for a transition school / childcare program for my daughter and was very fortunate to have found Maple Bear at The Alpha.  Deborah, the principal, was very accommodating with the onsite tour and answered all my questions in detail.  The school's facilities were new, clean and well-maintained.  (On a fun note, my daughter also had high praises for the food that they served!)  It was a very cozy, gentle environment for my daughter as this was her first face-to-face school setup coming from the pandemic where she was only exposed to online classes.  Teachers Ofelia and Cheng Yi showed genuine care and concern for my child.  My husband and I were given timely updates whenever she wasn't feeling well or had a minor injury.  Her classmates were also kind and welcoming - this is reflective of the culture and community that the teachers try to instill in the children.  Although we only had a little over 3 months at Maple Bear, there was a positive impact on my daughter's learning and growth.  I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone that is looking for a preschool for their kid/s.",
