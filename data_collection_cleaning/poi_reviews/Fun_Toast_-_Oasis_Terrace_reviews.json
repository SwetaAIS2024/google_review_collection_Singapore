      "text": "Food - I love kaya toast, and eating kaya toast with minimal kaya is so disappointing for me. The cup is big but the hot drinks were diluted.\n\nService - I think yall need to optimize your store better. If you want to have a wide menu, you need to hire more people to have specific roles instead of having 1 person do 3 roles and the quality comes out bad. And please change your POS system, cashier had to write down 1 by 1 what drinks we wanted and this caused confusion to the drink maker which caused a long queue.\n\nAtmosphere - everyone was just waiting around everywhere in store for their food because it was that messy, confusing and slow.",

I might be a little biased on food as I'm seeing their preparation, the counter has to \"beg\" a few times before the kitchen man starts to prepare the food (seeing him unwillingly preparing your food, how delicious can it be then). most of the staff spending doing what they think is right but ignoring the crowd. Let's hope they can turnaround the situation and I will still support them.",

      "text": "Went on 1/8/24 after lunch, newly open, very disorganised. Many staff chit chat all the way not following up their orders. Staff who do the bread toast blame counter staff for not letting her know that thereâ€™s bread order that I got to wait for 20 mins for my toast. My teh O was very blend. Many cluttering around, occupied tables. Went over to check with my order at collection point, lady staff very rude, didnâ€™t even bother to look at me continue with her inventory until I got to ask three times that also she nvr look at me. Only when asked then they started to do my toast. Customers just take advantage no order yet occupy a table, staff also didnâ€™t notice. Very disappointing place. Wonâ€™t come again, rather go basement for coffee. No excuse for saying newly open, shld be prepared for ts opening.",
