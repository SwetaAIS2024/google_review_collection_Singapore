The experience is absolutely amazing.\n\nA wonderful place to catch up with friends, old and new alike over drinks. Feeling hungry? Fret not as they also dish out bar bites.\n\nBeen going to this bar over the years and they have certainly kept up with times but with an old school, feel-good vibe. Great music, drinks and company, this is my go to place whenever I am in Chinatown.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Highly recommend!",

However, this year we encountered a lady who appeared to be dishonest. She claimed that we had given her a drink when we had not. The first time it happened, we tried to ignore it, but last night it occurred again. This behavior is concerning and does not reflect the positive experience we have come to expect from Mabuhay.",
