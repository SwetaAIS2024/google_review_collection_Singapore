      "text": "After hearing all the rave reviews from the US, we were excited to try Popeyes Singapore â€“ and it delivered on some fronts. The chicken sandwiches were a real standout: tender, bursting with flavor, and served on fresh, soft buns. The chips were well-seasoned, though they came off a bit soggy and lukewarm, and the extra free sauces were a nice bonus. We also enjoyed the crispy biscuit with jam.\n\nOn the downside, the signature chicken piece was mostly dry, and the hazelnut chocolate soft serve lacked a genuine hazelnut flavor, coming across more like a standard chocolate soft serve. The nonya chicken didnâ€™t impress either, and while the nonya pineapple drink was refreshing, it needed a good stir since most of the syrup settled at the bottom.\n\nAdding to the mixed experience, a looping soundtrack played continuously at each location, which was quite annoying.",

The staff at the store was still quibbling that this was the color of spicy and asked me if I wanted to exchange it for the original if get the spicy still will facing same problem. I felt that the answer was too unprofessional and he was just trying to evade responsibility. In fact, he just needed to exchange it for me instead of shirking responsibility with an arrogant attitude. Really bad experience!!!",
