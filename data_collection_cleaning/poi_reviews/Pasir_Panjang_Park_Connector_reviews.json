The artistic shelters showcase the historical significance of the place, very cool concept to do so since the port will move away in years to come.  By then, this park will be nicer with the open sea on one side!",

      "text": "The Pasir Panjang Park connects Labrador Nature Reserve and West Coast Park. It is not quite connected yet at the front and end sections. But, once the Wholesale Centre and the Container Port move out, hopefully, it would be nicely connected up.\nThe Park, mimic the once sandy beach of Pasir Panjang with stretches of sandy vegetation.  Maritime artifacts like ship bollards, anchor, along with a canon, are featured. It also features a Nature Playgarden catering to the children.\nSeniors will remember an old canon and the concrete railings at the old Pasir Panjang Park where, at that time, the shoreline was closer to the Park (before reclamation work)\nIncidentally, a very small section of the Concrete Railings is still intact, behind the Food Centre. There is also an old steps leading into the water. The steps are at the canal behind the carpark, next to the Food Centre.",

      "text": "This section was opened early sept 2021.\nAccess to the park can be either through the pasir panjang food centre carpark or opposite PSA Horizon.\nNot many people around I guess due to it being new and just a short stretch. There are distinct lanes for human and cyclists, small playareas dotting the linear stretch of the park. The park ends abruptly where the bukom terminal is. Not quite sure if in future it would connect to the adjacent park.\nNothing much here at the moment, perhaps wait till larger sections are completed. I took this path on the way to labrador trails to break the monotony of walking down pasir panjang road.\nWill add on more once the other sectors open up and revise the ratings.\nOtherwise, it is flat and wheelchair, prak friendly. It is also easily accessible either by mrt (pasir panjang) or car or bus.\n\nAccessibility - 4*\nSize - 3*\nThings to do - not much\nOverall 3*",

Also, as a relatively new park, most of its tree are yet to grown big enough to provide shade along the path.",
