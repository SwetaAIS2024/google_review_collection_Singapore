The dumpling wrap was probably too much in comparison to the meat filling, making the dumplings taste starchy. The soup was strangely sweet; likely attributed to rock sugar.\n\nOrdered a large portion for $5 a bowl.",

Dumplings’s too little to get the texture ( abit of “Tee Po” dry fish), and, a bit mushy. The lady owner was abit rude today. $3 for plate is reasonable.\nWill try the black version next time. Maybe it is different?",

But the wantons were a disappointment - the wanton skin was too thick and the minced meat inside had no taste. The noodles (not the wantons) are worth a try if you are nearby.",
