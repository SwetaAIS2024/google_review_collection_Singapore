Jinyoung Park,4,"I thoroughly enjoy the Chinese spicy taste. The steamed dumplings are delicious, and the cucumber salad and spicy stir-fried chicken taste like Korean fried chicken. The spicy stir-fried potatoes ordered by my daughter's friend were the most delicious. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, it feels like a Chinese-style potato wedge. Spicy and crispy foamy potatoes are a taste that makes you want to eat them again. I automatically think of beer.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100424929606806092903/reviews
