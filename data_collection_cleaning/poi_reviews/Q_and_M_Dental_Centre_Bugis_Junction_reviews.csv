Yeow Ng,5,Many thanks to Dr Maria Sherilyn and her assistant (sorry I didn’t get her name) for providing a relaxing and calm experience during the first session of my tooth crowning on 28th March. Dr Maria Sherilyn was very skillful in her works and explained clearly every step from grounding down of the tooth to fixing the temporary crown while giving constant assurance. Both of them were very professional and thoughtful while making sure I was comfortable throughout the whole procedure.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107779460989970904400/reviews

Teo Michelle,5,"I had to do a filing urgently so I popped into the nearest dentist. I always hate to visit dentist, but I was so lucky to meet Dr Edward Chun was on duty. Dr Edward was so patient, warm, friendly, assurance, attentive and helpful. The last few visits I had to do more complicated matter, Dr Edward was so gentle and caring. He always let me know when his next move and what he will be doing. Constantly checking with me if I'm ok. Even the nurse was so sweet that she actually was calming me when I had a injection. One of the rare time when I visit dentist without having any fear. I feel so relaxed and confident with Dr Edward. I want to highly recommended Dr Edward to anyone who needs a very good dentist.  Thank you Doc. My last few visits, all the receptionists and nurses are very nice too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914978115836992819/reviews
Monica Hong,5,"I'm very grateful to Q&M bugis, all the staff are super nice.
I will strongly recommend Dr Yong. He is confident and since our first consultation, he has assured me that the wisdom tooth removal process will be painless. Indeed, it was pain-free and fast, the entire procedure was smooth.
In addition, he checks in with the patient to see if they have any concerns and provides incredibly thorough explanation.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118339329121060472091/reviews
