The staff gave me the wrong menu, and when they redid it, it was still wrong. I ordered 1 shot of coffee, but I ended up with 2 shots (the default, I assume). It was way too strong (for me), and I couldn’t drink it. I didn’t want to make a fuss, so I just left without drinking it.",

The guy kept giving me his back while he took 5 mins to open the fridge and took out a croissant. Another 3 mins to put it into the toaster and still pretending that there is no customer waiting in queue.\n\nLeft without ordering and went to another cafe where I was greeted with a warm smile.",
