      "text": "A somewhat out of the way place near the Clementi Fire Station. Quiet place in the mid morning of a Saturday. Was there to grab a coffee / matcha while burning some free time.\n\nIt shares the rather spacious place with a gelato parlour. Was there for the coffee / matcha and therefore didn’t try the ice-cream but they had a few interesting flavours.\n\nThe service at the coffee side was pretty poor. While it’s a weekend but I would expect a friendly face rather than one that is so surly and disgruntled.\n\nThe drinks - macadamia coffee and matcha latte, were forgettable and lacklustre in flavour. Surprised and disappointed given the rather good ratings. The banana cake was also dry and lacking in flavour.\n\nThe space is kind of weird, they have a corner partitions by glass for the coffee with limited seats but connected to a larger area with more ample seatings where they serve the gelatos.\n\nWe sat at the gelato area and since it was quiet, it was very comfortable - we literally had the whole place to ourselves.\n\nThe upside is the parking… limited but free as it was private to the shophouses.\n\nI would return likely to try the gelato but I’ll skip the drinks.",

I also felt that it wasn't very appealing to serve it in a paper cup. Their coffee was also not impressive.\n\nWould not come again as it's not worth the price.",

Not too crowd and not noisy.\nThere’s NO wifi and tab water at the place. And restroom was broken when visiting (need to borrow restrooms next door). Wouldn’t recommend for using laptop here.",

Really enjoy the space as it is quite aesthetic: also have windows that pour the natural light in. There are limited seating inside but there are benches and stools outside which are quite comfy too. It’s located in an interesting spot where it gives a very homely and neighborhood vibe - which I enjoy very much. The coffee itself I found could improve a bit more on the balance between the acidity and bitterness, but was still acceptable.",
