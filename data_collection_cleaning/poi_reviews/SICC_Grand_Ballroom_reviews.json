      "text": "Was there for a football club fundraiser and the first interaction was with the security personnel at the gate gantry.  Absolutely impressive! Very professional, friendly and articulated directions clearly.\n\nThe ballroom: layout with a narrow foyer limits networking activities prior to the dinner.  Cocktails were so so and limited standing tables.\n\nThe ball room itself is right sized for a 30 table banquet max.  Food was decent and service crew was great\n\nLooking forward to my next event there",

      "text": "Enjoyed my evening, atmosphere was fantastic and place was spacious! Enough space to put 30 tables of 10, a stage and 2 projector screens. Definitely felt grand and suitable for wedding. My only complaint is the food - while still good, it wasn't very stand out (could be to do with the dishes served and not the overall standard of the kitchen). Dessert was also very sweet and fish very tough. My friend having halal food also commented that the food was not fantastic taste wise. The platter and scallops were good though!",
