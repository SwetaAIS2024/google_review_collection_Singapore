I fell at 7 months and she saw me immediately (despite a busy surgery), was very calm and understanding towards me and reassured me the baby was fine. She gave good guidance throughout the preganancy, although you do need to trust her (I found this very easy) you have chosen her so you should follow her medical advice. I had a very easy and  calm experience with her support and guidance, highly recommend.",
