Karen Chiam,5,"Been going to Dr Moses Ng for my acne and ezcema for over a year now and im very pleased with the end results!

I used to have lots of acne on my face and back, as well as ezcema on my face due to damaged skin barrier. Dr Moses Ng treated my eczema and acne fully while also making sure to never compromise my skin throughout the entire treatment process.

Dr Moses Ng is friendly, informative and very thorough with his work and I definitely recommend to look for him! Staff are also nice and friendly too. I am now confident in my bare skin and very happy with the results❤",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110022348911385883661/reviews
Liza Zul,5,"I’ve been struggling with active acne for months, and I decided to give Apax Medical a try after hearing positive reviews. The staff was very professional, and they took the time to assess my skin condition thoroughly. They recommended a combination of treatments, including facials and laser therapy. After a few sessions, my acne has significantly improved, and my skin is clearer than it’s been in a long time. I’m so grateful to the team at Apax Medical for helping me regain my confidence. Highly recommend for anyone with stubborn acne!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111126817312528608809/reviews
sook tan,1,"I am very disappointed with the service I received. I booked an appointment for minor surgery at Kovan on December 13, but after checking with your staff, I learned that I need an antibiotic. I have sent two messages, along with a picture of my prescription, to confirm the date of my surgery so that I can plan my work schedule accordingly. Unfortunately, I have not received a response. It feels like your staff is not interested in assisting me, which is quite frustrating.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112235492395508310005/reviews
Yeo Sinhan,2,"This clinic penalises people who are punctual. I came on the dot/ probably earlier for my appointment but was led to the waiting area which is understandable. There can be some delays here and there. But it gotten out of hand after waiting for more than 30 minutes, seeing people coming after me but able to consult first. I asked the reception and they said that their appointment was earlier, hence, the justification. I’m like, aren’t they late? The person that went before me was late for 30 mins but still got in ahead of me because the persons appointment time is earlier. Ridiculous logic. Lack of common sense here",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106111917288714604742/reviews
