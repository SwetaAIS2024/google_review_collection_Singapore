Rosenawati Hamsar,5,"Ordered from grabmart GM-007, grabrider left out my frozen item and i immediately called Ntuc Compassvale and manage to speak to wendy..and refered to her TL..relate my issues and i have agreed to come down and collect...at first they wanted to deliver to me (its not their fault in the 1st place it was GRAB that missed out my orders)which i told them its ok i am willing to come down and collect. To my surprise, i was welcome by wendy and angie at the cashier, both are very polite and friendly especially angie.. kept apologising for the lapse although its not their fault but their professionalism is awesome. Plus a small token as gestures was given to me. I was really amazed on their customer service..once again thank angie ng and wendy..i will definitely come back and shop at ntuc compassvale😍😍😍",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105029958146852070154/reviews
