Li Ming,5,"My child is typically introverted and quiet, but he absolutely loves this kindergarten. Every morning, he is happy and at ease. I was referred here by a friend whose son graduated from this kindergarten, and she spoke highly of the teachers and the principal. So far, the teachers my child has encountered have been patient and loving, which I believe is the most important quality. Thank you to the dedicated teachers and the principal. I wish all the children here a happy and wonderful childhood.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111906031008220007178/reviews
