      "text": "Enjoyed the lunch dishes. We order brussel sprouts, breakfast platter and meaty Mac and cheese for 2 adults and 1 child. The platter was very generous. The meaty Mac and cheese is a tomato based spin off of the usual Mac and cheese which is a nice touch. The brussel sprouts were very tasty with the toppings and the  ponzu sauce. The cheesecake was light but not quite my personal preference. The Nutella milkshake has a nice balance.\n\nThe place is quite nicely decorated but kind of squeezy and has limited capacity. Would advice to go earlier before lunchtime if you do not want to wait. :)",

The jelly cheesecake does not taste fresh already.",
