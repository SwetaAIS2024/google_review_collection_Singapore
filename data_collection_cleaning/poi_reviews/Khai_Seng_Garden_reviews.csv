FERNANDO SALAMO,5,"This place is great, tons of options for plants, trees, vines and ornamental plants. We have been there several times and made purchases of multiple plants and other items. The service is great, and the offer so much including something I never heard before, they offer ""Plant Hotel Service"" so if you have to travel for an extended period of time they can pick up your plants and take care of them and deliver them when you come back. Back to the service, my wife and I walk there on a rainy day so Kelvin after taking our order offered to take us to our house. Kelvin is very personable friendly and an expert when it comes to plants. We recommend this place and we will continue to make out plant related purchases there.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102177955260524155764/reviews

Mary T,5,"I‚Äôve bought several beautiful plants from Khai Seng Garden for many years and highly recommend them!

The owner himself is often there, very friendly and kind, knowledgeable about all the plants and makes great recommendations. We just bought this beautiful ‚Äúdragon bones‚Äù succulent plant, and he waived the delivery fee, gave us a complimentary clay saucer,  and even organised delivery on the same day. In fact it showed up just 3hrs later at our door step, safely delivered by two employees! We were so impressed by the service.

The plants are really all in good condition, well cared for, and the selection is huge. prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity. There‚Äôs even a covered parking space which is really convenient.

Will continue to support!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115570948615794378940/reviews
