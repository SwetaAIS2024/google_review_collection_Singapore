Totally worth it.\n\nLocated on level 2, a little hidden next to the cruise boarding area this Toast Box outlet is always crowded. Although the crowds disperse quickly if they are catching the Batam ferries.\n\nThe eggs and toast are well executed here, making $6.20 traditional toast set worth while.\n\nI have been here several weekend mornings and manage to get a window side sea view table, enjoying my breakfast with a view.\n\nService is always cordial with the staff here.",
