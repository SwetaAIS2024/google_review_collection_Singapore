Eric Ho,5,"Very Professional in managing their patience. Staff is very knowledgeable in the product and able to patiently adapt the product to fit the patience’s handicap. My set was set very well and improve my hearing as soon as I step out of the office.
Great job in explaining my hearing loss profile and explains the recommended product to compensate my needs.
Well done and looking forward to my follow up appointment in one month’s time.
Thank you",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112933719721476859493/reviews
