The century egg porridge was the star of the breakfast. She added one whole century egg into a bowl, cut it up into small pieces, and then poured hot plain porridge into the bowl, followed by a few types of sauces and oil. It really lived up to its name, and it was one of the better century egg porridge we have had for a while.",
