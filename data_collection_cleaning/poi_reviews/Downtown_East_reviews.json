      "text": "Wild Wild Wet, located next to Downtown East in Pasir Ris, is one of Singapore’s largest water parks and a great spot for family fun.\n\nThe park offers a good mix of thrilling rides like the Torpedo and Free Fall, along with kid-friendly attractions such as the Kidz Zone and Shiok River.\n\nIt’s well-maintained, with lifeguards on duty and clean facilities. Weekends can get crowded, so visiting on a weekday is ideal. Great value for a full day of water fun, especially with combo deals from Downtown East.\n\nJust take note that they offer locker that charges $12 for small lockers for 1 days. Big lockers will cost more.",

Be warned that bbq pits only last till 11pm and is non-refundable if there is a weather disadvantage. Most of the shops close too quickly at night as well though there is a 7 eleven.",

      "text": "Really sick of going there sometimes. They're always making use of the open air car park for one thing or another. Worse part is, the car park is huge but they always use the lots closest to the shops. I mean come on, common sense can? Sometimes we just wanna pop in to buy dinner, but gotta park so gar away and walk miles. They can always use the lots furthest from the mall so people can still park close by.\nTo the tenants, if you wonder why sometimes your business is slow, it because we can't park to buy food!",
