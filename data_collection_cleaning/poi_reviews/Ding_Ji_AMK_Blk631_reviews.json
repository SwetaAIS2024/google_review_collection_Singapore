      "text": "Actually quite surprised to see bad reviews for this stall. Maybe I only come during weekend evenings? I am always served by the friendly Chinese lady. This is one of my go-to stall for BCM. I always order their signature bowl. Huge bowl of ingredients and they don't stinge on the dried sole fish that makes the stock so superb. The addition of some wolf berry makes it special. If I want to complain in anyway, it is only that the noodles serving size is pretty small. Maybe just nice for ladies but for an adult male definitely not enough. Nonetheless the chilli, garlic oil (there are small pieces of fried garlic inside!) and vinegar makes the noodles a worthy companion to the soup. I will still highly recommend this stall.",

      "text": "I started going to this stall early of 2022 and I can't help but be impressed by this stall. It is open 24/7, ideal for gourmets who are always hungry at night. My home is located in Queenstown, but will sacrifice my sleep/time and travelled down for a bowl of Laksa at any moment of the day. However, every trip is a risk and to find that the laksa has finished is frustrating. Don't worry, they have more noodles choices, my second choice will always be the fishball noodle. The fishball noodle is great too, but I'd rather go with the Laksa. You might want to get down early. A bowl of Laksa cost about $4.50 (quite reasonable). A bowl of Fishball Noodle cost about $4.50 as well (not worth it) However, the aunty's smile and brother's spirit will put a smile on your face at 2am in the morning. 10 stars for sure!",
