My wife, on the other hand, raves about the white carrot cake, describing it as crispy and packed with flavor. We're both impressed with the quality and taste of these dishes!\"",

Would definitely visit again to try their char kueh tiaw, carrot cake, hokkien mee and oyster pancake.\n\nKudos to the old couples!\n\nGentle remind that they do not open on Sundays. Please also give a little patience while waiting for the good food.",

First bite, I think the above review was much overrated. The carrot cake blend AF. Definitely can't taste any wok hey. There was a funny taste in the yellow prawn mee. The prawns are fresh though. After finishing the food, I still think it's very much overrated.\nInitially thought of just leaving without finishing the food but don't wanna waste. The food is edible.\nDidn't want to leave any bad reviews but don't want people to get misled by the hidden gem review below.",
