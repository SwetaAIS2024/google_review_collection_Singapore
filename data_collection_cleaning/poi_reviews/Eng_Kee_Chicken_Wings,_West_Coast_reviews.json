This stall really look simple like any other econ beehon stall but I promise the bee hon is much much more tasty than it looks. FCW is like the homely tasty taste. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "I placed an order at this store earlier in the afternoon, requesting to pick it up at 5 PM. I arrived at 5:10 PM, expecting the order to be ready as agreed. However, upon arrival, I was told to wait a “short while,” with no clear indication of how long it would actually take. After sitting there and waiting without updates, I eventually realized that the preparation time would take 1.5 hours — a discovery that could have been avoided with proper communication.\n\nWhen I called earlier to place the order, I was not informed that payment was required in person before the food could be prepared. This key detail was only revealed when I asked the staff at the counter, long after I had already arrived. Had I known this policy upfront, I could have made alternative arrangements or adjusted my plans accordingly.\n\nThe lack of communication and transparency created significant frustration and led to a wasted trip, as I had driven 45 minutes to collect an order that should have been ready. Instead, I was left waiting for 1.5 hours without any indication of this delay beforehand. I hope the store reviews its communication process to provide customers with accurate expectations and avoid similar inconveniences in the future.",
