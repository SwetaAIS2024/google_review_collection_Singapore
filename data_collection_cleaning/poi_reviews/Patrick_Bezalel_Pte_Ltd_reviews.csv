Manfred,5,"Apart from having a good artist, there also needs to be a good team of staff who carry his heart. That makes the experience all the more beautiful.

David and Angie were two such staff who welcomed me today! They happily showed me some features of the paintings (like the AR) and also how the pieces are mounted :)

Glad to have taken time from work to see the art in person, and the wonderful people at work to create a good experience for customers.

Jael Sonja Kalisher,5,"I have been to quite a few art galleries, in various countries around the world, but I have yet to experience, sense, and literally feel the awe of being in one's home-base of creation and art expression.
Seeing Patrick's numerous art pieces, varying in kind and form - has touched my very core, and I'm forever changed by the experience.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113837721914710027798/reviews
