Yee Yieng,5,"LOVED THIS SO MUCH! I could taste how each ingredient was made with care, and everything just tasted so good. I ordered the lasagna and pappardelle di spadino‚Äîsuperb! üòç I will definitely revisit to try other pastas and desserts!

The restaurant owners personally came by to check if everything was okay, which felt so warm and welcoming! Also, the restaurant is incredibly clean, and they are very particular about hygiene and cleanliness!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104727597473372656990/reviews
Eski Teague,5,"Quaint and not too flashy, just the way I like it. We ordered the Christmas special chicken, lasagne and calamari.

My goodness, to start, I was thoroughly impressed and FLOORED by the lasagne. It was DELICIOUS and one of the best lasagnes I have ever had. The calamari was fresh and the accompanying sauce was a great coalescence of flavor.

I would highly recommend trying the lasagne and the calamari!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112902925656014827173/reviews
Anonymous WSushi4413,5,"This place is amazing! I went there on my birthday . For starters, the menu is very simple.10/10 for service . The lady was very welcoming and patient. We even received a complimentary dish! It was delicious. Next, 10/10 for food. The portions is worth it for the price and the taste is really good . Would recommend the seafood risotto. Lastly, 10/10 atmosphere , it  was really cozy and there were paintings painted on the wall of the views you would see in Italy.Pretty and cute decorations too! The chef is the mother and she was really pretty and friendly. She came out to talk to the customers. We were given a cake which was a special Italy cake, should be on the menu. Overall would definitely recommend and I will definitely be coming again from Singapore.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116067676733748570726/reviews

It was a farewell meal ü•ò & I think we are a little boisterous playing some game.
