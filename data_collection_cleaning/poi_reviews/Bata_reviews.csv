Karyn Tee,1,"Had another unpleasant experience with the same sales associate. This isn’t my first encounter with her, and she hasn’t changed. She was rude and unwilling to help, making the shopping experience frustrating.

When my daughter was trying on shoes, she kept insisting that we just take sizes from the shelf instead of assisting properly. When we requested a smaller size, she muttered, “So small?”—as if doubting our choice. Her attitude was dismissive, and she made no effort to provide good service. She stood off to the side the whole time, looking displeased.

Extremely disappointing service. If she doesn’t want to help customers, she shouldn’t be in retail.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103625110324497836635/reviews
Karen Lim,5,"On 11 Feb I visited the Bata shop in BPP and wanted to buy a pair of Sch shoes for my son. There was only 1 staff at the store. A young man was serving everyone. He patiently waited on all of us, got us the sizes and colours and had a system even though we all wanted him to attend to us at the same time. He would even attend to a few customers at the same time and still keep his cool and be genuinely cheerful. I paid by PayLah! And he patiently scanned the code and taught me how to access it. I was impressed with his attitude. He could have been grumpy and fed up being overloaded and still having to wait on me but he wasn’t. He’s happily wished me a happy new year. Now that’s customer service.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109166271222213486532/reviews
