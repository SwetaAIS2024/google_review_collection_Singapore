gan shengkai,1,"Highly NOT recommended to come here if you want to do ear impression for CIEM.

1). When ear impression something wrong or not perfect, they would not help you to redo or refund for you.

2). This place made me spend extra $300 for reshell service, new ear impression at other places and 3 months for shipping and processing.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116887415151436697447/reviews
