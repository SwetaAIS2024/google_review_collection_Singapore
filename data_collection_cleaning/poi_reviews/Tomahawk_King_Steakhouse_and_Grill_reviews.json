Regrettably my introvert personality didnâ€™t let me get his name. Iâ€™m sorry ðŸ«£\nAs for the food! Delicious!!! And pricing were affordable too!! Tho Iâ€™d say the size of the chicken for the Kings 2pc combo was kinda small but yooooooooo I really loved it!!! Although my hubby prefers KFCâ€™s ðŸ¤­ well, to each their own! Iâ€™d order it again during my next visit!! Actually Iâ€™m not sure if I would??? Cos I had the steak and it was delicious too :( and not to mention their a5 wagyu Hamburg, promise it was so good!!! But hor, not really a fan of their aglio olio, I find it rather bland to my liking for aglio olio. If youâ€™re coming for dinner, might wanna make a table reservation in advance!",

      "text": "Tomahawk steak was well cooked, medium-rare which was what we asked for! Though i would order the ribeye the next time since they are the same cuts with a big price difference.\n\nFried chicken was the overall favourite, sauce was good but did not exceed expectations when we realised it was mayo-based and the mayo flavour was quite prominent.\n\nBlooming onion stayed crispy throughout our meal which lasted almost 1.5h which was really satisfying!\n\nRemarked that it was a date and the staff served us a cake on the house, super sweet staff, very good service.\n\nOrdered:\nTomahawk steak solo\n2 piece chicken meal but changed the fries to the mozzarella dipper\nBlooming onion\nIce water\nCoke zero\n\nDamage: $119",
