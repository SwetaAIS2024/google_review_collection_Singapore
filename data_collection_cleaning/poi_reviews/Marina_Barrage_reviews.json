Yesterday I came when it was raining so it was a bit humid.\n\nPlus point, near MRT so it's convenient for tourists. I would recommend people to come here if you have no where else to go.",

      "text": "I visited Marina Barrage on a Sunday morning at 8 AM, and it was already lively with many people setting up their picnics on the rooftop. The vast green space is perfect for laying down a picnic mat and enjoying the fresh air. However, I highly recommend bringing your own food or buying it beforehand since there are very few options available nearby.\n\nOne of the best things about Marina Barrage is the open and spacious environment, making it ideal for families, joggers, and even pet owners. Kids can run around freely, and it's a fantastic place to fly kitesâ€”I saw many families enjoying this activity! The wind conditions are usually great, making kite flying effortless and fun.\n\nBeyond picnicking, the panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay Sands add to the charm, creating a beautiful backdrop for photos. The cool morning breeze makes it even more enjoyable, especially before the sun gets too strong later in the day.",

It's not a high observatory, but there are no buildings blocking the view, so you can see an open view. The winding road leading up to the observatory is also really unique. You can see the water gate blocking the seawater entering Marina Bay. If you cross the bridge here, you can go all the way to the East Coast, so it's a popular place for cyclists.",
