      "text": "Always heard above the rave about Saladstop so I decided to try it but was so disappointed.\n\nFirst, there are multiple extra $$ if you choose toppings in metal containers instead of plastic ones, leaving me with very few options. The container colour could also be hard to discern under the lighting. Was met with a lot of impatient from the staff.\n\nMoreover, the protein serving is EXTREMELY small, added on protein for $5 for tuna and the staff only gave 4-5 small pieces.\n\nThis is the most unsatisfying salad bowl I have ever eaten, $15 for a bowl with limited autonomy to choose your toppings + small protein size.\n\nYou will get better value for money eating at any other salad place. Hyped debunked.",

      "text": "Not the first time having SaladStop but first time at this outlet. Ordered harvest bowl and sabai sabai. Staff got my order wrong so they had to make one of the bowls. It’s the lunch rush so that’s understandable. However, the product quality is subpar. Both bowls had too much dressing. The harvest bowl was too salty and the sabai sabai too sour - we couldn’t finish our food. Noticed during food prep that the staff did not fully dry the mixing bowl between orders and they were rushing through orders. Everything just felt very haphazardly put together. Will chalk it up to the lunch rush but consistency in product quality could and should be tightened.",

      "text": "This is the right place to have salad or plant based diet. Very vibrant atmosphere and cooperative staff to explain you different varieties of dishes you can order. Their “Create Your Own” salad/ wrap or grain bowl is awesome. The quantity is right and spices you can add as per your taste. The beauty is you can have pure vegetarian salad (salad is usually vegetarian) here. Price per person is around 10-15S$.\nI have tried “Create Your Own” salad for third time and first time ordered on my own. (This was introduced to me by my friend). I would recommend to anyone who wants to “taste a salad that is tasty”. Please visit",

      "text": "This outlet treats online pick up orders like dirt. I have multiple negative experiences already.\n\nToday I waited half hour for my order. About 20 walk in customers who came later than me all got their orders before me. Even when I kept enquiring about my order, staff couldn't be bothered. I had to ask for it 3 times!\n\nWhen I finally collected my order and went back to office, I discovered that broccoli which I ordered is missing. I had to waste time to walk all the way back in the hot weather to Saladstop. Staff then informed me no more broccoli. Why can't they tell me when they are preparing the order? It seems like they really cannot be bothered.\n\nI asked for a refund but they said I cannot get one because it's online order. This is ridiculous.",
