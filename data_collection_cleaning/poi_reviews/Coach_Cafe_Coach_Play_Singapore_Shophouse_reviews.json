      "text": "The Concept Store of the Coach Brand is the first Coach Cafe in Asia. The bag brand was founded in 1941.\nThe unique shop is very beautiful and stylish. Inside the eye-catching pink building, the location of the cute cafe\nWhen you enter the front, there will be a Digital Screen as an introduction for us to see. When you enter, you will see both vintage and New York atmospheres combined in the Coach Play concept. Both those who like the brand or those who are Cafe Hopping will love this. There will be very friendly staff to give advice. The decorations are colorful. You can take pictures and have fun. The coffee is very good because it is a collaboration with Brawn & Brains Coffee in Singapore. The drinks are delicious. If you come, I recommend ordering The Coach Hot Chocolate (13 SGD) because it is served with the C logo. The taste is strong. There are also many other dessert and drink menus.",

      "text": "It‚Äôs quite hard to find a cafe on Keong Saik on a Sunday. There are some local options like Killiney but I just needed my western coffee fix. Came across this pretty and attractive pop up cafe by Coach.  Cafe is run by Brawns and Brains, which I knew they would have good coffee. Instead of my usual iced white, I saw the B&V coffee milkshake. Well, this gotta be different then. Priced at $12 but it was before gst was added. My drink was $14+. Abit pricey for a milkshake but never mind, I have already ordered.\n\nMilkshake is quite good and the coffee makes it even better. I believed only for coffee drinkers, you might wanna try this. I saw from the menu they have other desserts too, it was pre-dinner for me hence did not try any desserts though. Perhaps next time when I‚Äôm around the area again and when the pop-up is still around.",

At least we didn‚Äôt leave ‚Äúempty-handed‚Äù!\n\nThe staff was polite and helpful as she guided us through each floor and explained the ideas behind each concept room.

      "text": "Coach Caf√© on Keong Saik Road offers a visually stunning entrance with its vibrant yellow design, making it a standout spot in the Chinatown area. Housed in a charming shophouse with 3 levels to explore. The caf√© also doubles as a retail space for Coach products, including bags and fashion wear. The staff here are genuinely friendly and welcoming, adding to the overall pleasant experience.\n\nWe sampled a few drinks: the Iced Mocha, Iced Black Coffee with an extra shot, and the Long White. While the coffee was decent, we were hoping for a sharper and stronger flavor, especially from a caf√© associated with such a well-known brand.\n\nOn the food front, the Coach Brownie was a highlight. It came with three pieces of chocolate brownie paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, sprinkled with pistachio‚Äîa satisfying treat. However, the doughnuts were just alright; they were fluffy but lacked filling.\n\nOverall, if you‚Äôre in the area and need a place to relax, Coach Caf√© is worth a visit. It‚Äôs a lovely spot to sit and rest, even if the coffee could use a bit more punch.",
