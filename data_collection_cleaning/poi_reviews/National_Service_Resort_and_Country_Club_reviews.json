      "text": "Resort Bowl @ NSRCC.\n\nA good place to bowl on weekdays. I've been here on a few occassions to bowl & have always been greeted well by the friendly staff at the counter. No crowd at all. Lanes are well maintained & oiled. Ball hooked well right to the back end.\n\nI've frequent the Bowling Shop & bought some bowling stuffs from James. A humble experience retired bowler, driller & owner of the shop. Very happy to have him serve us always.\n\nSadly the Bowling Cafe is not halal but they do serve hot drinks. Good if they served some halal snacks like pau or sandwiches. The least to serve muslim bowlers & chalet occupiers.\n\nThey have karaoke rooms & game arcade too but be prepared to loss some token. Machines are abit run down. Overall in one place, serve its purpose well in a club house.",
