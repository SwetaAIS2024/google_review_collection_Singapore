蛋卷,5,"Nice cozy vibes.

Delicious fried chicken, pairs perfectly with the pickled melon and waffles.
Big portion as well.

Their steak was also pretty decent.

Tried their infused whiskey, was an interesting experience.

Dinner service could be a little pack, and waiting time for food could be on the longer side and less attention from the service crew",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111181037012317394496/reviews
Darren Sim,5,"I had an incredible dining experience at Yardbird! The Fried Chicken and Waffles were beautifully presented in a charming wire basket, served with refreshing watermelon cubes – a delightful combination of crispy, juicy, and sweet flavors. The watermelon wasn’t just a garnish but an intentional palate cleanser, perfectly chilled and subtly sweet, providing a vibrant contrast to the rich, crispy chicken and fluffy waffles. The Lobster Mac & Cheese was equally impressive, with tender lobster chunks atop creamy, cheesy pasta, making every bite indulgent. The presentation of both dishes was stunning, and the flavors were rich and well-balanced. The cozy ambiance, paired with attentive service, made the meal even more enjoyable. However, walk-ins are almost impossible, so securing a booking is highly recommended for a guaranteed table. Yardbird is a must-visit for anyone craving elevated comfort food with a touch of sophistication!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110664130938344492493/reviews
Glen Tan,4,"While a tad pricey (expected given its location and view), my wife and I feel that it is compensated by the great view and ambience when seated at the first level. People watching while eating is one of our favourite pastimes. Enjoyed the apps, salad and main pasta. Pasta was slightly salty but was okay overall. Recommended for all to sit on the first floor for the view!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108432195103414492671/reviews
MH Tham,4,"As a pet owner, I am grateful that Yardbird has made its alfresco seating pet-friendly.

The space is equipped with two jumbo outdoor umbrellas, an air cooler and tastefully placed planter boxes to enclose the area. While the space is tight and may not completely shield against heavy rain, the effort to accommodate pets with these arrangements is commendable.

Conversations can get quite lively in the small space, which might be a concern for pets sensitive to noise. Perhaps Yardbird could consider offering its semi-alfresco indoor area as a first cut for non-pet owning guests? With limited alfresco tables, calling ahead is recommended, especially if you are bringing a pet.

Service was prompt, attentive, and friendly, though the interaction with my dog felt more like polite curiosity than outright pet-friendliness, but I will take that as a win any day.

As for the food, it is undoubtedly restaurant-quality, but the prices reflect that. Happy hour deals are mainly appealing for drinks, with small bites priced less competitively. Portions are generous and the food is flavorful, but it can be pricey if everyone orders a main and several sides. Sharing mains alongside sides is an option to reduce waste and manage costs. While I would love to visit more frequently, the pricing is a barrier for casual dinners.

Overall, it was a positive experience. Despite the higher cost and limited seating, I would gladly recommend Yardbird to fellow pet owners, ideally for special occasions or celebrations rather than casual visits.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112376174358198242550/reviews
Kendrick Wee,3,"Ordered half a chicken (5 pieces), came with 2 chicken wings. Not too sure how many wings half a chicken actually has. Well seasoned. Meat was not too dry after fried. Above average taste that did warrant the high price. Crab cake was good. Brussels sprouts could be done better as the outer layer was not crispy.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793547912532718349/reviews
