      "text": "Never regretted enrolling my children in this centre. The teachers are patient, loving and sincere. They would update my children's progress regularly too! The Principal is always there, taking initiative to communicate with parents, and she's a hands on principal. That's really great! She would always be there to welcome the children in the morning.\n\nOverall, I never had to worry whenever my children were with them. Both my daughter and son love coming to school, always looking forward to seeing their teachers and friends.\n\nThank you Kidz Meadow Yew Tee for the passion and dedication in educating my children!  I highly recommend this centre!",

      "text": "My daughter was transferred from another school to Kidz meadow yew tee a few years ago because at her previous school she was made always sit at a corner because teachers said she's lazy to learn. When she entered kidz meadow yew tee, teacher suggested to bring her for check up and we found out she have dyslexia. Teachers at kidz meadow have very eyes for details. They don't straight away judge your child, they will find root cause and then get it treated from there. She have graduated and in primary 2 now. I have another son who's been with the school since he was 18 months and we all thought he was mute cause he was quiet all the time until he went kidz meadow and start singing nursery rhymes and talk alot. Time flies he's graduating soon. This year 2023 i enrol my 18 months son with medical history diagnosed. 2 school rejected him because they don't want to take risks and if I insisted to send my son to their school I must be with him at all times which I felt defeated the purpose of sending him to school. They also suggest me to send my son to special school at Awwa which I don't want because I want my son to feel that he's normal. Thank you kidz meadow yew tee for accepting my son and being a educator and 2and mom to my Children. I'm sure those who send their kids to kidz meadow will give the best review like me. Trusted preschool I must say\nNot forgetting the centre principal who always on the ground with the children unlike other preschool u can only see their principal sitting inside office no interaction with children.‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèº‚≠ê",

The staff are kind, gentle and genuinely care about the children they look after. My daughter is kept safe whilst being given the most incredible opportunities to learn about the world around her.\n\nKidz Meadow has given my child the platform she needed to flourish. I have noticed so many positive changes in her. From her speech to her ability to play with other children, she has just been enhanced from every angle!\n\nOverall, I cant express how amazing this small, intimate and loving preschool is. Its a truly beautiful environment for children.",
