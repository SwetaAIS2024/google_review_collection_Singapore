سهيلة,1,I ordered around 6 plus in the evening. Unsure whats their issue. The Mee Bakso was cold. Noodle wasn't blanch. Gave me ayam penyet chilli instead of bakso chilli.  Thankfully my stomach is still ok now at 1030pm. Terrible terrible terrible service. Total regret.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117926951884520231642/reviews
Defi Fertina,5,"DPenyet is a must-try for anyone who enjoys bold, flavorful dishes. The combination of textures and flavors, along with the restaurant's cozy ambiance, made for an unforgettable meal. I highly recommend it to fans of Indonesian cuisine and anyone looking to try something new. Very family friendly too because kids menu are also available. Love the indomie. The staffs are friendly and good ambience too. Highly recommended!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115319270450416645321/reviews
Isaac L,5,"It's been a while since, we finally had the pleasure of savoring good ayam penyet again. The chicken was so mouthwatering that my daughter, who usually doesn't finish a full meal, wanted it all to herself. We were more than happy to order another serving. What stood out was the freshness of the food, which is crucial for us. I also tried the Tahu telor Goreng, which was incredibly delicious, although a bit salty. However, I understand it's meant to be shared with rice, and I must admit, but I enjoyed it that way all by itself.  The owners were all hands on deck. Very nice couple hope to see you around Punggol too.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103715143213981871749/reviews
William,4,"Had the Indomie with ayam penyet. The Indomie is not bad but maybe additional sweet sauce was added so it doesnt taste as how I remember Indomie to be.

Ayam penyet is also not bad.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114916696399917166666/reviews
gee M,3,"Ayam penyet is good, however the rest of the indomie dish is disappointing. The noodles look like a lot but it’s actually flattened and spread out, too salty and not enough veg. For $12.50 I feel like they can afford to give slightly more noodles and veg.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113534020976231477384/reviews
