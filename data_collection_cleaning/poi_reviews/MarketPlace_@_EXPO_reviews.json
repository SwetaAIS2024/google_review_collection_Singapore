      "text": "This place almost feels like a carnival with good vibes. They are several photo-worthy spots, a good selection of food and drinks. There is even live band performances on tuesday to sunday nights.\n.\nI ordered the:\n. Chicken Cutlet Special Black Fried Rice (Gorilla Fried Rice) $7.90\n. Cereal Chicken Wings (Cravy. Halal Store) $7\n. Mixed Carrot Cake (Huat Huat) $5.50 for individual flavour.\n. Mixed Grill (D's hood. Halal Store) $25\n. Pork Sisig (Iskina Cebu) $16\n. Teochew Fish Soup with minced meat (11 Street) $10.80\n.\nWe literally had food all over the region under 1 roof. There are more stalls opening in the works so it is definitely a fun dining place to revisit.",

Must-tries include the Kimchi Paper-Wrapped Fish from the Mala stall and the Nan Ru Pork from Dynasty Fried Porridge. For halal options, Crave serves up tasty Korean-style crispy chicken.\n\nNice vibes, plenty of seating, and a live band at night adds to the lively atmosphere.",

There is a different live band everyday. The Saturday one is good. The crowd is singing along as I type this. So cool!\n\nCravy Korean chicken wings is really good. Love their Osaka flavour. They even provide gloves!",

This place offers different varieties of cuisine which surprisingly good quality üëçüèª but of course the price is definitely not budget friendly.\n\nOrdered the sio bak and char siew and taste damn good! The skin is crunchy but not hard. Damn good! The thai food is legit good! üëçüèª soup is flavourful and the minced pork rice with the runny egg is very good! Well seasoned but a little tad spicy.\nFor the roast pork by Iskina Cebu, the skin is tough and portion is pathetic...  it is a very disappointing dish actually. So big no for this stall.\n\nOtherwise the place has lotsa seats and well planned Q system to prevent long standing queues.",
