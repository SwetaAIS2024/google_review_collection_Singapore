      "text": "Went for lunch just now with family. Overall was not bad. The portions were generous. Service wise, okay. Had a hard time deciding what to order as there are toooooo many items on the menu!\nü¶¥ Battleship tulangü¶¥ was something special and I would like to recommend, however the pita bread, I wish it could be slightly more charred...\n\nThe ¬πNasi goreng Kampung was good, and the medium portion had a great portion that could keep 3-4 eaters well-fed. ¬≤Nasi goreng Tomyum was rather a little different from what we usually had elsewhere, it's sweet and spicy. And luckily we should choose the spicy level, which is very considerate. ¬≥Kangkong balachan was carefully cut, not those big and messy ones you get at those local tze-char stalls üòÇ, I kinda like it here. ‚Å¥Buttermilk prawns came with a nice crispy texture, the gravy was sweet and great to pair with the extra bread we ordered. ‚ÅµCalamari remain crispy even after 30 mins into our meal. That's nice. For the ‚Å∂Sambal stingray, it does have a big portion, good for a table of 4-5 person. Could see it's done deep fried first, then grilled. The sambal on stingray was nice to pair with our Nasi goreng a as well.\n\nAnyway, had a great time at this place. And we had to take away our leftovers because the portions were really alot!\n\nMight be back to try the western food someday~ ‚ù§Ô∏è",

(no pics of the food as we were already done by then ü§£) p.s. the restaurant also offers free parking right outside!",

Despite the great vibes of the place, the service is slow and the new menu has alot of wrong item plus unavailability during a public holiday. Disappointed with this experience for a family lunch",
