M *,4,"The TimHo wan Marina Bay Sands Mall is a crowded place, but surprisingly, the queue to enter was faster than expected. However, the food arrived very slowly, one dish at a time, which wasn’t ideal for a meal. It seemed like there weren’t enough staff to handle the busy crowd.

The HK-style dumplings were spicy and flavorful, but they were a bit oily due to the chilli oil base. The dumpling noodle soup was typical of Hong Kong style, but it needed  chilli padi sauce to enhance the flavor. The radish cake arrived very late and was quite oily since it was fried and use chilli oil to make it spicy. It could be skipped, but it did taste good.

The service staff did very well though and managing all the food. And always nice and helpful. That’s just a plus even the food arrive late.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103330821176864508073/reviews

Sharon Maria,5,"The food was simply superb. The ingredients used were all of excellent quality. The staff had a very pleasant and friendly demeanour from the moment we arrived till we left. With such warm hospitality and service, who wouldn’t decide the next visit on the very day. The one staff I would like to mention is Chloe. She made our dinner very special. And last but not least, the mango sago desert made us craving for more. We ordered 2 portions of Yangzhou Fried Rice.
