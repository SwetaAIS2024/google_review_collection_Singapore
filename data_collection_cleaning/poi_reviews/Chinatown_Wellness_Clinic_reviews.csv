Ken See,5,"I visited Dr. Lai today on the recommendation of a friend, and I was utterly impressed by her patience and meticulous attention to detail. Despite having to bring along my 23-month-old baby due to a scheduling issue, she went above and beyond—handing him a book to keep him entertained while she attended to my concerns with great care and professionalism.

A special shoutout also goes to Chun Li for her warm and thoughtful good service. Thank you for making the visit such a positive one!

Wee Kim Goh,5,Dr Lai is a very caring and attentive doctor. She will take the time to listen and know more about your condition before prescribing any treatments. She cares about the long term welfare of her patients.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100563171422395315368/reviews
Flank Ton,5,I would like to express my utmost appreciation to Dr Gregory Chan who encouraged and assisted in getting my aged dad to join Healthier Sg. He did not rush through the vaccination process and really took the time to understand the patient’s current medical conditions. Truly professional . Kudos to the front desk service staff as well for making it a pleasant experience.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115323477656203274231/reviews
Firly Yusmal,5,"I got referred to this clinic because I had a bad experience with another one, earlier in the day.

The service staff tended to me quick and polite, she knew that I was already happy with the previous encounter and she made me comfortable. All this despite the clinic being busy.

The wait was quick I was tested for Covid under 10 mins, waited for results, and not long after 5 minutes got my medication. The doctor was also polite and clear with her instructions.

This clinic deserves more than 5 stars - my only 2 regrets were not getting the names of the service staff and doctor (they deserve a warm shoutout)

My other regret is I did not go to this clinic first, instead of the previous one that left me with a bad experience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113999635314280333708/reviews
T T,5,I went to do an influenza test and seek medical consultation. The staff are friendly and patient in sharing information. They are also very organised. I saw Dr Lai and she was very attentive and very clear in her medical explanation. I think their services are much better than other GP clinics I went before.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116896944504266699385/reviews
