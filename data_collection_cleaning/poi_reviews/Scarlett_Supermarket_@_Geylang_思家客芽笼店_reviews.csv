Flo Yeow,4,"It's an interesting Chinese supermarket, selling very cheap Chinese snacks. Located in the heart of Geylang, there are also a fair bit for Chinese Nationals that this supermarket services in the area. Prices are extremely fair, and you also get special items that you'd otherwise likely not get or find on Shopee. Worth a visit if you're in the area, but not something that you'd specially swing by otherwise.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Hrmgr,2,"Normally do not review supermarket on products as it may not be the manufacturer afterall but felt the need to caution on these items. Bought the sweet corn branded Northeast Farmer Wife previously and tasted okay. Today went to the same outlet and unfortunately only left 1 but the sale if for set of 3 so picked up 2 branded Shiyue Daotian as picture. The former was as previous but the new 2 tasted like made from rubber after first bite.
The corns were rubbery and tasteless except the corn water in the pack. Seriously, I thought they were fake if not for the label.
Scarlett should QC the products they carried especially similar ones but imported by different vendors.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews
Y jl,5,"Actual location is at 317 geylang road. Not as stated. Could be old address.

Anyways, I am happy with Scarlett supermarkets. Any outlets are great. Prices of China imported food/snacks/toiletries are cheaper than shengsiong etc.

So if you are a fan of China drinks/snacks, go to Scarlett. Some outlets are even 24hours. Do remember to be a free member to get points. I dont drink alcohol but I do observe that the China beer are cheap.

This branch, you can buy cold dishes and hand made buns too. I'm a happy fan of this branch as I can park at the door step and load my favourite drinks in cartons ü§£ü§£üëèüëè",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101601652709904595784/reviews
Winnie S,5,"Great 24-hour supermarket that sells unique products from China.  You get very interesting snacks, such as instant noodles (unique ones from China), tidbits, groceries, drinks even beer! All from China. Brands that you probably could not find in typical supermarket such as and Fairprice and SS. There is no Q at this Geylang outlet. been here twice around 10 pm. Shopping was orderly. I didn't wait long at all to check out.  I saw some interesting frozen food like dumplings, seafood (atypical seafood like mini lobsters, top shell). There are many dried exotic mushrooms. I think a big plus is the wider varies of soup base for steamboat lovers  There's mala plus others. I also found the popular yogurt drink, Ambrosial (Anmuxi) from China. They have the bigger bottle types here in various flavours. Payment methods are varied, you can use Alipay as well as PayWave, Nets and Cash. The 2-unit air-conditioned outlet is situated in between two bus stops so if you're looking for it it is really right between lorong 14 and 15. I got some packet mini bread, mala beancurd (very good), blueberry sticks and some peanuts as well. However, in this second trip, I could not not make a re-purchase, as they were sold out,  business must be quite good. The staff are all busy unpacking and stocking the shelves.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112621465549676606096/reviews
Crystal K,1,"One mid age female cashier lady very impatient, just asking the promotion price, she keep saying the final price. She can just tell me the discount will automatically show in the end, but she chose to yell the price herself. And somemore fogot to gimme a free gift, when I asked her, she say go find another staff‚Ä¶maybe its the hot weather, makes her so unhappy, but she got paid.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116988998546532676994/reviews
