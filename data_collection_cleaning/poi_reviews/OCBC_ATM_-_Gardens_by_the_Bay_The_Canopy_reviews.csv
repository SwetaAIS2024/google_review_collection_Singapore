Chamitha Bandara,5,Gardens by the bay you must visit one of the awesome and creative gardens in Singapore. This is a modern gardens. It’s better to visit between evening 3pm till 9 pm Because you can see without lights and with lights. There is two light show in the evening at 7:45 pm and 8:45 pm. Both shows last for 15min. This is the one of the amazing light show with beautiful background music. Definitely recommend to anyone. Specifically kids will love this place. Inside the garden there is food areas and washrooms. Best for Hiking.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108113068184813603512/reviews
Lovely Cameraman,5,"Additional pictures of the place for all to see... Yes, the view is breathtaking and like all other “commercial” attractions, you would have to pay to enter.

For those who are really afraid of heights, I urge you not to go up the bride. There can be a lot of tourists and guests walking slow, walking fast on the long and winding bridge. So once you think you have secured a photo spot, stay put and wait for the crowd to pass. Make sure you test your cameras and set them to the right settings and all you have to do is wait for the right moment, and snap away quickly. The key is to be very patient. Some guests can be damn annoying.

But once you get your photo opportunity, I assure you the pics will turn out nice, especially when you’re up close to the camera while the lens is on wide angle. Always, always shoot on wide or superwide mode because that’s where you can really get a sense of the place in your pics.

A little tip, be aware of your background. Seaward-facing might be cool but not as cool as when you can get a shot of the Marina Bay Sands or the Singapore Flyer in the distance.

Oh, yes... During hot days, the air at the top of the bridge can get a little warm. Any other time or spots, the air-con is really cold.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114888323272768689180/reviews
