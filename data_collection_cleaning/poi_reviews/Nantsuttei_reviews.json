      "text": "Came here around 12.15pm on a Friday afternoon. We were a party of 5 (4 adults and 1 child) and this is what we got:\n\n3 bowls of Kara-miso ramen with 2 of them being lunch sets. 1 extra order of noodles and 1 rice bowl with char siew. 2 plates of chicken karaage. We got spice level 2.\n\nI was recovering from the flu and it was still a touch too spicy for me. I think level 1 would’ve been more comfortable as level 2 hit the back of my throat with the chilli. Having said that, the broth was rich and flavourful. The pork was very soft and not at all gamey. Very tasty. I’ve had other ramen places in Singapore with bad char siew and this is not one of them!!\n\nWe had both pork and chicken gyoza and the pork definitely tasted better. The chicken karaage was fried to perfection and the wasabi mayo on them was great.\n\nAt the end the rice bowl with a bit of the broth we added on was fantastic as well.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place.",

Despite the restaurant's popularity, the staff seemed disengaged and uninterested. While I don't expect a luxury dining experience, basic courtesy and attentiveness are essential, especially considering the 10% service charge.\n\nI could only see a little bit of customer service from the cashier and the awesome delivered food auntie.",
