The $77 jogbal set can serve 3-4 people. Access is easy just off the AYE, with ample car parking in the basement.",

You can choose 2 flavors and we had garlic and spicy.\nThe spicy one was sweet and spicy but after a while you can feel the hot! It‚Äôs good to have this flavor and it can reduce the fatness.\nThe garlic flavor is also good and nice with all the sauce!\nThere is a stew of beef and spicy noodles which are both really nice!\nWe were really satisfied with the meal and definitely enjoyed it!",

Next we had spicy seafood tofu soup which is equally flavorful.\nFood is definitely value for money considering the freshness, portion & superb taste. Not forgetting the appetizing side dishes. Do not underestimate the spiciness which we loved.\nWill come back for more! üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",
