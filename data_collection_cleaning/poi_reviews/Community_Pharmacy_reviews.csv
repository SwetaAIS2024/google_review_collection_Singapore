selina lee,1,"Have not seen such a rude pharmacist in my life! There is a purpose for people to go to a pharmacy. If certain prescription is not available, being a pharmacist you can always give some recommendations based on the customer's need. If the clinics are open, why would one be bothered to go all the way to the pharmacy to buy. A star is just for writing this! You don't earn any!!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115142475642159051699/reviews
