A very nice place to study/work in as there’s not much crowd also.\n\nMenu is kinda limited and abit more expensive than your usual canteen but still under $10 for mains. Free flow soft/hot drinks for $2.5 if ala carte or $1.8 if you get it with a main.\n\nFood is a hit or miss - sometimes it’s really good (the fish and chips, nasi lemak), sometimes it’s kinda eh (the pasta, mainly). Not bad though! Would consider this as one of my lunch or dinner options, especially if I need to do work.",
