Dilparinder Singh,1,"Very rude receptionist. The doctor (Mr Phua) is really nice and takes thorough time to discuss with patients, but the young receptionist at the clinic is very rude and disorganized - she is friendly to select group of people and rude to rest. She gave me appointment, called me to come earlier if possible and then I ended up waiting for 1hr+.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104451039148349301107/reviews
AT,1,"I had a very disappointing experience with the counter staff, Sharon at this clinic. I called to check on the availability of the flu vaccine, but she was incredibly unhelpful. Despite my repeated inquiries, she refused to assist by checking with the doctor, citing that she was “very busy now.” This lack of basic courtesy and professionalism is unacceptable, especially in a healthcare setting where patients rely on staff for clear information and support.

The clinic should prioritize training its front-line staff to provide better service and ensure patients feel valued, not dismissed.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117319274823506584801/reviews
Cosmo Warner,4,"Dr Phua was really excellent - super efficient with diagnosis and general treatment.

Only reason not 5 star is because the young receptionist was somewhat grumpy (seemingly a recurring theme per other reviews). However more senior receptionist was lovely and Dr Phua was great.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110961524663061826080/reviews
Jalen Tan,2,"I need to clarify on my mum’s medication but the telephone number I tried calling for 135 times for almost an hour, i could only hear automated messages saying that the line is engaged. Is the number even real? How can the line be engaged for so long? Tried to submit online enquiry, the website don’t even allow me to submit the feedback. Terrible.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116723858900191773222/reviews
Lee Ash,5,"Dr Phua is a very knowledgable, compassionate doctor. My asthma condition has improved alot with his care last 4 years. And recently when he knew of my pre-diabetics condition, despite his busy schedule, he shared asvices on how to manage and monitor them. Definetly a doctor that has the heart for his patient. No wonder, the clinic is always crowded with long wait.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114209250681680684800/reviews
