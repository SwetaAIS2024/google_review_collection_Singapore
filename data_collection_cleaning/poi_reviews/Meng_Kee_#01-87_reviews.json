Crispy, juicy and tasty.\n\nStandard chill but being on the slightly sweeter side\n\nMeh\nWhile $3.50 seems cheap but not alot of chicken to be had. I will probably add a serving of fried chicken for $1.\n\nSoup is weird. Fried shallot in soup.\n\nNot much lemon sauce given.\n\nCons\nThe rice was soggy and sticky. Taste is there but too soggy.",

Chicken chop is average. Soup is a little blend too. Portions are decent.\n\nPrices very affordable here, starting at $4.\n\nChicken cutlet seemed to be their speciality and I might consider going for that next time.",

There was a short queue on a weekday lunch however service was efficient and brisk. Chicken was crispy and tasty.. i did feel however that the rice could be improved to be tastier.",
