Pizza is freshly made so can take a few extra minutes. Crust is medium, not truly thin crust. Good selection of varieties. Open till pretty late at night for those late dinners too.",

The order was done via foodpanda and it arrived fast. Both pizzas were still warm when received. Perfect for those who would like a snack for tea time. For the price paid, it was definitely a steal!",
