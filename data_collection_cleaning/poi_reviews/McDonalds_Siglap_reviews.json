      "text": "This is one of the worst McDonald out there, I think if not because of its premier location, it would have gone out of business long time ago. The staffs there are always rude (to be fair, I think this is the boss’s fault as the shop is very understaffed and everyone looks stressed out). Whenever there are good stuff like a good toy for happy meal, they are always out of stock, and even the auto machines run out of receipt.\n\nRecently they hired an older gentleman name Seah, the manager obviously is not happy with him but honestly I think he is best staff there, at least he is very friendly to customers, which is more than what I can say for everyone else there.",

      "text": "Noticed a decor on a glass panel beside the self-order booth. To me, it looks like an animated outline image of a pig’s head, as it is pink in colour with a drawing of its pointed ears + what looks like a snout. (see photo attached). I asked the outlet shift manager, he claimed it’s an image of a cow. When I asked him why a cow is pink in colour, he gave me a sheepish smile. When I asked him if the image looks like a cow or more like a pig, he smiled again without giving me an answer.\nIt may be a trivial issue I’m bringing up here, but I feel a change in the colour of the ‘cow’ from pink to brown or black would avoid any unnecessary misrepresentation of the image since McDonald’s is a halal-certified eatery.",
