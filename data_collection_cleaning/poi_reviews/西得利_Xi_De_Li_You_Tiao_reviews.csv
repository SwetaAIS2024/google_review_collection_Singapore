Keify Toh,3,"Very normal curry puff. Not spicy and the crust is thick.

Goo Bakmi,5,Have not try the rest. But you tiao is 5 stars.  Not oily and nice salty flavour that goes so well with coffee.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104071409397230107746/reviews
C Irene,4,"Just tried the ""Butterfly"", dipped in coffee. Nice and hot and huge. Everything in this store is priced at $1, including the curry puff. Will try that in my next visit. Redhill food centre is a gem.

Tried the mini Youtiao - even though not hot, soft and light. Love it! Got another $2 (3 for $1).

Overall:
Youtiao - 5 stars
Mini Youtiao - 4 stars (inconsistent- was not cooked properly the 2nd time I got this.)
Butterfly - 5 stars
Tapioca - 4 stars
Curry Puff - don't like this.
