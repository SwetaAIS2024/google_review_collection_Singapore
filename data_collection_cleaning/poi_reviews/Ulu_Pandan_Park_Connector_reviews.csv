C,4,"Ulu Pandan Park Connector is a well-loved green corridor in the West, stretching alongside the Ulu Pandan Canal. It links key residential areas like Ghim Moh, Clementi, and Pandan Gardens, while connecting to other major trails like the Rail Corridor and Bukit Batok Park Connector.

It’s a great route for walking, running, cycling, and even birdwatching with wide, well-paved paths and plenty of greenery along the way. The connector also passes by several small parks — including Faber Heights Park — and offers occasional rest spots and fitness corners. While not the most scenic path in town, it’s peaceful and practical, with good connectivity and a strong community vibe.

I’d rate it a 4 out of 5. It’s functional, accessible, and enjoyable for daily exercise or a weekend ride.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
Andrea Olivato,5,"Amazing place to walk/bike.

Lots of trees for cover and separate lines for walking/cycling.

There are a lot of people especially during evenings and weekends, but there’s enough space for everyone.

The views of the river are beautiful and you can hear and see a lot of birds.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100712413444294703058/reviews
Jeres (Jleecycle),5,"A nice place for jog or walk. After part of the PCN closure (due to the landslide at the construction site of BTO), there are lesser cyclists passing through this section of the connector.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105121994674560195544/reviews
STEPHANE ROMEI,4,"This is quiet PCN that runs along the canal, large enough to fit all mobilities, on both sides of the canal. There are breaking up to cross roads but only a few easy to cross (no pedestrian bridge)
You will also find an old railway bridge and a spot where eagles stay around.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115601790007989573306/reviews
