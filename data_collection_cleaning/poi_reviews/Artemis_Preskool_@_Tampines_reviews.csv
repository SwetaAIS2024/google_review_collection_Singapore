Alson Tan,5,"My child attended Artemis since he was 7 months old until he was 2.5 years. With a heavy heart, we transferred him to a nearby school for practical reasons. We had a great experience with Artemis.

We thank teachers Erika, Santa, and He laoshi for being such caring and loving teachers. They were patient, kind, and took so much pride in helping my kid grow. From events such as learning his first steps, we can tell from the videos they sent, of their enthusiasm and joy in helping my little one learn and grow. My wife and I can't thank or appreciate them enough.

While some very occasional admin hiccups were noted, we're glad the admin team worked with us to sort it out.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104238015474896882383/reviews
