Rennie Lee,4,"Saw a queue here early morning and decided to join in! The bee hoon is really flavorful! Price is good too, beehoon + zai er + fried egg cost only $2.70. Would have been perfect if there was a vege dish (cabbage or anything) but I didn‚Äôt see it on the menu. Otherwise, super value for money!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104896149882118051128/reviews
Douglas Seah,5,"Perfectly fried eggs, basic fried bee hoon with a plethora of fried stuff. Sinful but awesome. Slightly pricier than other stalls but well worth the calories once a week.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107477715700835137855/reviews

This an old school stall, selling only fried Beehoon and noodle with some fried stuffs like, eggs, fish cake, fish fillets, chinese sausages.

It has been around since the 80s, stall owner is very fast with her service which is a important in hawker trade.

However, this stall don't open daily, open as and when she likes. üòÖ
There are time it was closed for a long duration.

Quality of her food is consistently good! Hence you can see a long queue when stall is open.

Do take note, stall is open for breakfast only. In the afternoon, the stall sells Rojak.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107525131369857002446/reviews
