Cindy Sim,4,"Surprisingly delightful experience at Lotus plant-based Chinese Restaurant. Quality and presentation of all the dishes ordered were beyond my expectations. No, the bill did not hit a hole in my pocket as it was reasonably priced. A good place to impress your in-laws who would like to try vegetarian food at affordable prices in quite- a- cozy restaurant.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111199325305837945873/reviews
