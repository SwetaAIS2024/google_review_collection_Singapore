WL T,4,"Best place in Singapore to catch the native Grey-headed Fish Eagles. Resident pair of Momo and Bobo provide daily demonstration of their fishing abilities to their loyal birding followers.
Only gripe is the lack of toilets, food, and sometimes shade in the afternoon.
Other birds that can be regularly seen here are purple and grey herons, pair of cockatoo, white collared kingfisher, changeable hawk-eagle, Brahminy Kite, etc",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112165343522804253556/reviews
