Yellow Mellow,1,"Worst possible place to live in. Management is useless. Elevators keeps on breaking down. Every month there will be water disruption for 24hours! No alternative at all from the management.

Sometimes there will be electric disruption too.

Most of the lightings at the basement are out.

Everytime when its raining the basement will be flooding and no action since the last 5 years I’ve live here.

The best part is if you complains to the management, they will blame you back.

No parking assigned to residents, anyone can just drive in and park ad they pleases. BUT, they made privileged parking for their management staff. What a joke!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110208582482479884782/reviews
Gator,4,"Booked through Airbnb and allocated unit at block b, level 8 W1. The unit was a two-storey unit with 4 bedrooms in total. I believed our host was a business managing Airbnb units called Nest Home. Their instructions were clear and didn’t experience any issues checking in on our own. The car park was a a bit narrow though so bigger cars would need to be careful navigating in the car park. Security was good, friendly and showed their presence everywhere.

The unit was clean though I believe there was some wear and tear which was to be expected since it’s not really a new development. Bed was ok just that the bedsheet wasn’t the best quality, hence it’s abit rough. But it’s definitely clean. Towels, utensils and other necessary amenities were well provided. The unit fit the ten of us really well.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
Hani Isma,5,"Staycation at A02W7. Unit facing the road... I thought it's pool view... Anyway the unit is spacious, 3BR. But toilet and kitchen sink not so clean but still acceptable... If you order fp/grab, they can enter and deliver to which tower you stay... Anyway, we are satisfied & happy staying here.

ATL T,5,"Nice quiet place for a staycation. We booked the family apartment which consist of 2 rooms,  a living room, eating area and cooking area

Location is a 5mins drive to legoland and mall of medini.

Bad points are the toiletries seem to be empty. But the host replaced within the same day.

Although parking is great and there is ample security, lots are limited at night.

There is a fitness corner, gym and small swimming pool. Also a tennis court.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100994464112605528590/reviews
Jimmy Wong,4,"Giving it 4 stars for its comfort and quietness. The only missing piece of the puzzle here is that it's located way too remote from even a convenience store, let alone cafes or restaurants within walking distance. On the bright side it's only 10 minutes away from the second link checkpoints.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101968637875959537946/reviews
