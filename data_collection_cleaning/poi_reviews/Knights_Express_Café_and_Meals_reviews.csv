Mark Lim,5,"Wow! That toastie and coffee from Knights Express was amazing!  So good and afforable! We're Wings Academy on level 5, and getting lunch was such a drag and often skip our meals – we've been waiting forever for a cafe to be opened in the Haite lobby that can prepare nice eats and good coffee. 👍☺️😋",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115109873236133476737/reviews
