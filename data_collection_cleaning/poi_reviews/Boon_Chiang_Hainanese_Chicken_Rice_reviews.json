      "text": "Had chicken rice a couple of times here and tried the curry noodles today. A good amount of meat and the bowl was filled completely. Chicken was tender and succulent. The curry noodles need a good stir before eating else the top gravy lacks flavour.\nRice was decent when I ate it. Though my neighbour mentioned that some days the rice was a little crunchy (undercooked) so it's not consistent.\nThai fried chicken cutlet had crispy skin but meat was so thin and dry. This is a big miss. Would not order it again.\nChili was a bit too salty for me.\nThe young staff was polite and nice whenever I patronize.\nPrice is slightly on the higher side, like most privately owned coffeeshops.\nMore hits than misses for me so still a decent food stall overall.",
