      "text": "Appointment at 4pm. Arrived by 3:30, the receptionists seem annoyed because they canâ€™t keep chatting laughing when patients arrive. I have an ultrasound and I have to sit around waiting for half an hour. Just to be told that I needed a full bladder to do the ultrasound. Why nobody mentions this at registration time? You think people can sit around for half an hour and donâ€™t go to toilet if needed specially if they donâ€™t know they canâ€™t go. Then have to spend ONE MORE hour there, just waiting for the bladder to be ready for the test because receptionists couldnâ€™t care less about speaking to patients. Nearly two hours of our time wasted. We even tried to book for another appointment for a different service and were dismissed. Iâ€™m not ever coming back to any Raffleâ€™s institution, go to MinMed or Fullerton instead.",

      "text": "My latest update :\nI am updating this review to clarify that my experience is simply my own. I naturally recall details vividly, which was why I mentioned things like Punggol nasi lemak, it was never meant to imply anything beyond my personal memory. Unfortunately, I noticed that one reviewer singled out my review in a confrontational and abrasive manner, making assumptions about my connection to Dr. Thong and my intent in sharing my experience. Everyone is entitled to their own perspective, and just as I respect that others may have had different experiences, I would expect the same courtesy in return. One can disagree, but engage with respect.\n\nI am sorry to hear that some people had negative experiences with Dr. Thong. My review reflects my personal experience with Dr. Thong, just as theirs reflect theirs. I hope they are able to find a doctor who meets their needs. Wishing them the very best.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI had a surgery performed by Dr. Joan Thong in recent time. I remembered she told me a surgery was needed. I like ok, started grabbing my purse and about to leave after she gave me a date. She said where I was going? I said I was going to get punggol nasi lemak for lunch. She said she needed to explain the procedure; I told her oh ok but why, I trust her and she could cut me up however she like, hahhaha.. I did sit back down and she went through the procedure. I thought I heard majority of what she said, but my mind was just thinking about picking up my punggol nasi lemak at Capitol. That was how much trust I had placed on Dr. Thong.\n\nI have ever once told Dr. Thong, even I have to wait for her for hours (now I think even days) for my appt, I would. But just only for her, I wonâ€™t even wait for men! By this time, she is the most beloved doctor of mine. Dr. Thong is the best (always so elegant, funny & kind), and all her nurses are super kind and sweet as well.\n\nPS. Dr. Thong is highly professional, very caring and kind. I do not know why a reviewer would even say she is rude. One thing I know, Dr. Thong is always honest and will not sugarcoat. Btw Dr. Thong looked super cool & badass in the operating theater with all the medical scrub and cap ðŸ˜„",

Most receptionists are unwilling to provide service; they just spend their time chatting amongst themselves, and when you arrive with an appointment already scheduled, they seem annoyed that you've arrived.\n\nPrivate service, which in theory should be premium, is actually poor and lacking in quality.",

      "text": "This is a response to a review that seems to misrepresent the reality of the situation. Also some additional detail for a review of previous visit for fertility specialist.\n\nPerhaps Dr. Joan Thong is your friend, perhaps you both enjoy Punggol Nasi Lemak, and perhaps your surgery went smoothly with a speedy recovery. Good for you. However, this does not apply to everyone and does not guarantee the same success for others. And your nasi lemak topic is irrelevent to her professionalism in her field. You are free to share your experience, just as others are. That said, your positive outcome does not invalidate othersâ€™ negative experiences, nor does it make your reply to their review reasonable.\n\nI would like to share some personal and sensitive details about my own experience with Dr. Joan Thongâ€™s practice, as I feel they reflect a lack of professionalism. While I understand that private hospitals charge higher fees, basic manners and respect are fundamental, especially in such a setting.\n\nWhen it comes to fertility checkups, they are inherently private and sensitive, particularly for women. During my checkup, Dr. Joan Thong inserted equipment hastily, with no regard for my comfort, as though I were an inanimate object. Naturally, this caused significant discomfort. When I expressed my pain and politely asked her to be gentler, she dismissively stated that \"pain isnâ€™t real because the vagina has no nerve endings\" and continued without addressing my concerns. At one point, she even had a casual conversation with the nurse, saying, \"Oh, it has to be inserted quickly to get in,\" as though I were a lifeless object. Her behavior lacked any semblance of professionalism. The entire visit felt dehumanizing, almost like a violation. A specialist should aim to provide comfort and politeness as a bare minimumâ€”not sugarcoating, but basic respect.\n\nDuring the process, Dr. Joan Thong discovered a cervical polyp and quickly removed it with simple explanation. She told me that the minor surgery would cause bleeding for a few days and that it would subside afterward. Then, she turned around and washed her hands. Meanwhile, the nurse was busy, and they both left me there bleeding. I had to ask the nurse for help to grab my bag so I could use a liner for the bleeding. Only then did the nurse remember I was bleeding. This level of negligence was shockingly unexpected.\n\nDuring the consultation, Dr. Joan Thong made condescending remarks, such as, \"Do you understand?\" She also tried to push diabetes medication on us, even though the test results were normal. When I looked at my husband to discuss whether to decline the medication, she rudely commented, \"Why are you looking at your husband? Do you need him to understand for you?\" This was not only disrespectful but also utterly unprofessional.\n\nWe later consulted other specialists, all of whom treated us with professionalism and care, leaving us with nothing but gratitude for their efforts. Our experience with Dr. Joan Thong was undeniably poor. Seeking a second opinion from another specialist confirmed this, as the care we received elsewhere was far superior and handled with the professionalism one should expect.\n\nFor those who had a positive experience with Dr. Joan Thong, weâ€™re glad it worked for you. However, we feel compelled to share our experience so that other women are aware of the potential issues they might face.",
