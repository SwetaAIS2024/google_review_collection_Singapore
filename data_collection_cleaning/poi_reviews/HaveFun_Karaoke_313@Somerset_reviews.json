      "text": "Quite a bad place to pick from if you're looking for a fun time to sing songs due to its facilities. The app is not user friendly and even the download app on the phone is not updated. They don't have any songs, it's all 1-2years old songs on the phone, you will need to use the in-house tablet to select the latest song which is not user friendly.\nOn the start, I came in into the room with mic that is not serviceable due to lack of battery and follow up the room door is not serviceable, it will not shut properly....but it could be just the room (E05) is not very good.\n\nOverall, this place is such a let down as compare to Bugis Cube outlet. I will still prefer Bugis Cube outlet.\n\nOverall experience (★☆☆☆☆ 1-5, 5 is the best)\nAmbient ★★☆☆☆\nConvenience ★★★★☆\nQueue/food waiting time ★★★★☆\nPrice ★★☆☆☆\nService ★★★☆☆\nFacilities ★★☆☆☆",

The atmosphere was ok, the couch had a few stains but the lighting is good. Heard about the baby roaches but luckily I didn't see any. The choice of songs are amazing (mostly on the older side) and easy to pick.",

Bernard told us initially that it's not served, but Alicia and Bernard paid a surprise visit to our room with 3 cups of rice balls. It's so heartwarming! Thank you, Alicia and Bernard, for your care and service! Will definitely visit again!",
