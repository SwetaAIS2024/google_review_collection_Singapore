Jet Lin,5,"Very fortunate to have sent my car here for repair and replacement of my left door. They handled everything well and fuss free. Sent my car on Wednesday and they managed to order a new door, paint and install it, returned the car to me on Friday. The door looks indistinguishable from the original.

Special thanks to Joshua who kept me in the loop through WhatsApp the entire time. Very VERY happy with the service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112312527809107034764/reviews
