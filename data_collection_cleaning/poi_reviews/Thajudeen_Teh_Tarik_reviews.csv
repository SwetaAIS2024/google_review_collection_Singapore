Dominic Tey,2,"Ordered teh tarik ice, $2.. came out super diluted, despite the store name being teh tarik.. i was hoping it could do that one drink well. Decent volume of drink but ur basically drinking 1-1 portion of water to teh tarik.. its not sweet, barely taste the teh.. and at one point i saw him pick up a straw he dropped on the floor to throw away. The next action was not to wash hand but hold the cup with his index finger on the inside of my cup.. Uh.. best to not order from here ya.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107604564728187371585/reviews
Royal Pears,4,"Enjoyed the teh halia (ginger tea) - strong ginger flavour and not too sweet.
From an earlier order:
Enjoyed the milo dinosaur, which was thick and chocolaty.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108275532362304111934/reviews
Sunny M,5,Agree that it provides the best ginger tea in town. Not for the faint hearted : ginger taste super packed and sweetness is just nice.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116788322544213433170/reviews
Philip Yap,1,Ordered a teh gajah (large tea).  Was Charged me $2 when it was actually $1.50.  Bought same from another stall priced $1.50.  This stall has  a history of overcharging especially when there are a few drinks ordered.  BEWARE of this stall.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113206579207256923024/reviews
Levin,2,"Pretty good teh tarik. Taste of tea was balanced with the sweetness.

The iced teh tarik was good too, with the balance shifting more towards the taste of tea.

Edit: quality can be hit or miss. Perhaps it was a lull period, but the stall just used what's left in the can without topping up. This resulted in an unexpectedly poor tasting teh tarik.

Was 4 stars, dropping 1 star for not ensuring amount of evaporated and condensed milk used stays consistent.

Edit 2: dropped to 2 stars for teh ice that's already diluted from the get go. I suppose its time to find another place for teh tarik given how many times it's disappointed me.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112878374817848127411/reviews
