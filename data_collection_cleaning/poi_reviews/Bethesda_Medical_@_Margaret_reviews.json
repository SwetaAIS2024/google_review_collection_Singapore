Prices increased too quickly and service can’t match with their asking. Poor ventilation. Medical group relies on their tenants to bring crowd in.\nFruits are better at nearby Sheng Shiong.",

Dr. Chen is very patient and clearly experienced, she took the time to explain everything in detail and made me feel comfortable throughout the consultation. The clinic staff are also incredibly friendly and helpful, making the whole process smooth and pleasant. I visited under my corporate insurance and really appreciated the fully cashless service. Highly recommend this clinic for anyone looking for professional and hassle-free medical care!",

Almost uncontactable despite multiple calls and messages left on the number given. It’s easy to make appointment online but it’s never confirmed until the receptionist gives a call. After which, any changes needed, it can’t be reached. I had to go all the way to the clinic to confirm my appointment.\n\nSuggest that the clinic looks into their customer service. Good service by dentist but the before/after care is way below expectations.",
