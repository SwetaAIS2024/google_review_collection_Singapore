The latter is usually sold out by 8am (yeah!).  This is one of my 4 favourite nasi padang stalls (the other two being rendezvous hock lock kee @ central, pu3 @ bencoolen and Mahan Nasi Padang, right next to tiantian chicken rice at the east end of block 450 clementi ave)",

      "text": "The range of food at this stall is not very wide compared to many other Malay rice stalls. However, today I wanted to have beef rendang and it was available. Taste of the rendang is tasty and aromatic but the beef is not cooked long enough and a little tough. Also had the sayur lodeh which was light in flavour but flavourful. Very generous amount of vegetables. The other dish I had was the kupang ( mussels), which I enjoyed. This dish is not alwsys available at other stalls.\nThe sambal chilli that comes with the rice is not too spicy.\nService is quick and the lady is polite.",

I would support this small business that has been a staple for Pasir Ris / Elias residents for so many years already.\n\nTheir Nasi sambal goreng is also very nice.",

Great flavour overall though.\nRice $1\nSambal Goreng $1.50\nOmelette $1.50 (there are some vegetables inside)\nBeef Rendang $3.50? (portion is normal and while flavourful, is kind of dry. The only dish I don't recommend due to price)\nHard to revisit due to the price and excessive portion size.\n\nOlder lady wasn't too polite in explaining that their Ayam Bakar is not on the menu anymore, despite the picture on their signboard.",
