Overall taste was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nSorry for the \"negative\" or over critical review. But since it was marketed quite well in terms of its visuals, i thought it was important to let others know how the food taste",

The fried chicken is nice with good har cheong taste and is crispy on the outside. However, the chicken is a little dry. The rice is too soft for me. The egg is done right but is super oily. Service person is unfriendly. Won't be patronising the stall again.",
