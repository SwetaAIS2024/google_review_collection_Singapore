bearythots,3,"Tried the cookhouse food run by SATS during enlistment day. Kway teow soup with rice noodles was light but refreshing with fish balls and tofu, and without MSG as not thirsty after eating it.

For the first 2 weeks, lunches and dinners were so good and so much tastier than any civilian cai png with 2 meat/fish and vegetable (often brocoli and not the cheap type or cooked until mushy) and other varieties like Western food and Bak Kut Teh. It would have been 5 stars if not for airline bentos, which were literally made in China, during the 3rd week.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108454681619644276739/reviews
Niyaz Aqmar,4,"Holy cow the boomers really don't like it when quality-of-life improvements were up to the army lifestyle. ""Back in my time"" K.

Do I think this camp is perfect? Obviously not, nothing is. But it's better than Tekong obviously. The trainers here *do* treat you like human, to say the least, and give the care that you'd need. That said, this is still an army camp, so there's obviously things and habits you need to change to fit to this lifestyle obviously (one that I myself can't even conform 100% because of some things that I don't agree with myself, but that's just an opinion)

Bunks have Wireless@SG WiFi, so you're good to go for any internet things, just note that it isn't 100% coverage for *all* of the camp though :)

Honestly speaking, I kind of enjoyed my time here. Not a lot of regimentation, but that doesn't mean you can just laze around and not do anything. You still gotta be on your toes for the trainers and yourself obviously.

Those that want to keng, it's up to them. Not my problem because it ain't me. You're just one step closer. Do what you have to do, or don't.

wis,5,"BMTC School V also known as Kranji Resort, the best BMT any recruit could ask for. I would not come here again, but I would pick this place over Tekong 100 times out of 10. Anyone who comes here will be in good hands but maybe not in good food. ONWARDS WITH COURAGE!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106790004288009580441/reviews
Neo Leonard,1,"The lack of thunderflashes and loudhailer is appalling. Didn't have anyone shouting pushups at your face. It's a shame but it is what it is. Trashy commanders overall, powertrippin' 3 arrows made the experience very bad for me.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116942733489902340919/reviews
Weaponized Saltiness,5,"It's basically school camp but with guns, food is decent (public school canteen level) and my commanders are great. Just keep your area clean, listen to orders and bring extra TP and a soap pump",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115505721345641213092/reviews
