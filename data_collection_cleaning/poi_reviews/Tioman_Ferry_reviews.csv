Mathilde Barbaroux,1,"This company actually sells Bluewater ferry tickets. Avoid Bluewater AT ALL COSTS! Got stranded in Mersing because they sold too many tickets and the original boat was full, and we had no information on if or when another boat will be coming. I called them and emailed them dozens of time but nobody answered. We finally departed 1,5 hours late. On further consideration they were aware of the situation well beforehand but never even emailed us to inform. The boat is old, dirty, and the seats are very narrow. Completely unprofessional and unreliable. Cataferry is incredibly better.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115938717971620288797/reviews
Michael R,1,"Old and dirty ferry, totally inflexible to change travel dates after payment. To return 2 days earlier as planned we were forced to buy new, additional tickets on the ferry even if this is inappropriate according to terms and conditions published on website. We got a reciepe after request only. Our inital tickets booked online were not refunded st all. As tourist I did not feel welcome. Sorry to say: Never again with bluewater.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114810406164007691564/reviews
Rishi Raj,5,"Contrary to reviews, I found Bryan/ Tioman Ferry quite helpful when I spoke with him. He advised me how I can keep myself updated with ferry schedules and also how weather elements would be critical on my travel dates. I'll update my review once I have undergone the complete booking process with them.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107438314653352908805/reviews
Nor Lizdayatul Syazwani Azman,1,"My family and I are using Bluewater Ferry service operated by Bistari Gemilang Travel Sdn Bhd. The price per ticket is RM60 per person, one way. The ferry was on time. However, the seats are not enough, we have to sit outside with no aircond. On the way to Tioman Island, the ferry broke down for more than 1 hour before reaching Kg Genting Jetty. Hoping for improvement in the future.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115753598547955110969/reviews
Maximilian Boll,1,"I wish I could give zero stars.
Totally unorganized and confusing. Maybe the employees should think about their job only one minute a day so they can improve a bit at least. Donâ€™t take this ferry.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103857563579230999622/reviews
