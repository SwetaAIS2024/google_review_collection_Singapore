The serving for ham and cheese toast was too small for the price paid; not worth it. Drinks were fine. Service was good.",

The kumquat tea was the perfect refreshing complement, not too sweet and very thirst-quenching.\nThe presentation was also lovely, as you can see from the photo.  Definitely recommend this place for a satisfying and delicious meal!  Looking forward to trying more of their menu.",

      "text": "Just had an absolutely fantastic meal at 'Ah Bowl Den'! The Heh Heh Laksa was a revelation ‚Äì a rich, fragrant broth with just the right kick of spice, and those prawn cakes? Crispy on the outside, succulent within, they were utterly addictive. And the Cordero‚Äôs Flower Herbal Chicken Rice was the epitome of comfort food, so soothing and flavorful. What truly elevated the experience was the incredibly fast service and the warm, genuinely friendly staff. Every dish was served promptly, and with a smile. The food was not just flavorful, but truly comforting, like a warm hug in a bowl. I'm already dreaming of my next visit to 'Ah Bowl Den'!",
