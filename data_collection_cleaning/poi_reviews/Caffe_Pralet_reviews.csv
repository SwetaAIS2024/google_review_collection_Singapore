Madeleine Tan,5,"These donuts truly live up to the reputation. Light, soft, and perfectly fluffy, each bite felt like a sweet little cloud. The burnt butter honey donut stood out, it tasted like a pancake topped with honey drizzle. The pistachio donut had the jam drizzle which didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark the jam and pistachio didn‚Äôt fully complement each other. The beef sandwich was just okay, tasted more like a McDonald‚Äôs burger with a simple patty instead of actual beef. The salmon sandwich instead is lighter and a better balance overall",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114071385496499747851/reviews
Sunny Side Up Eats,5,"Caffe Pralet's iconic square donuts definitely delivered! Obsessed with the rich smokiness of the burnt butter & the soft, pillowy texture of the donutüç©

Also tried their popular sourdough sandwiches‚Äîwent for the Magic Mushrooms & Beef'in Cheese'inü•™ Personally loved the Magic Mushroom more; it's loaded with flavor & ingredients that just work so well together‚Äîhearty but not greasyüòå

Beef'in Cheese'in was a bit too sweet for me though‚Äîcould really use a kick of heat or some pickles to balance it out~

Kelvin Goh,5,"Loved the donuts, my daughter was explaining how delicious they were. Soft fluffy, and the toppings were so good. Had to control ourselves from ordering more.
The sandwiches were great too. Innovative combination of fresh ingredients, yummy sauce, and the bread was fluffy on inside and nicely toasted on the outside. Staff service was very friendly and cheerful despite being crowded and having to attend to many orders.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111418740389191088133/reviews
Paul Chan,5,Great spot for breakfast or brunch. Sandwiches are freshly made and really good. The sweets such as donuts and hot cross buns are good too. Friendly staff and good service. Expect a bit of a wait but well worth it.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104085603801790709162/reviews
Weihong Wu,5,"Came across this caf√© on TikTok and decided to give it a try. We were originally here for the donuts, but surprisingly, the sandwiches stole the show! We had the beef and tuna sandwiches, and both were delicious.

As for the donuts, we preferred the pistachio and chocolate ones over the original burnt butter flavour.

Overall, the food was tasty, and the service was friendly and fast. The only downside is that the seating area is quite small and limited. Still, we‚Äôd definitely recommend checking it out!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112971311750104426314/reviews
