Rachel Lee,1,"To be honest, when we first toured the school we did not like it very much but still decided to give it a chance. Contrary to the tour we had with the prev sch where the teachers tried to engage, smiles and talk to my son, the teachers at Sunflower Preschool did not bother to engage or talk. (This was on a Saturday)

The Principal does not seem to know what she was talking about and when asked questions, the answers she gives were uncertain. I think this is where we should have caught the signs and not enroll him.

On the first day of school, one of the parents will be allowed to sit in for an hour to let the child adapt. I witness a few things in the school and was straightaway uncomfortable with putting my son in the care of the teachers there.

The list are as follows:
1. One of the teacher wearing a mask kissed another infant (Honestly, i can understand if sometimes teachers very sayang the baby then they wanna hug them or cuddle and kiss them. However, there are a lot of germs on the mask.)
2. During shower, the teacher look frustrated when showering my son as he was no familiar with the place and kept crying. ( You can tell from the mannerism)
3. During milk feeding time, the teacher vigorously shakes the bottle while the bottle was in my son’s mouth to make him drink the milk.
4. The school strictly limits milk for my then 11 MONTH OLD son at 1PM & 4PM only. This is actually my dealbreaker. There is not flexibility whatsoever. I have called the principal to discuss this however she was firm and would not give any leeway. Her reason being - they are at the age where they have to train their motor skill (?) Something along the line. I have checked with other schools and there is no such policies or rules in their IFC.
5. I don’t believe the school was honest. In the school app, the school always input that my son finishes his milk. My son always have a problem w drinking his milk and there will alw be leftover. Even in the previous school, he hd an issue with milk intake and the teacher will feedback in the school app accordingly.
6. On his first day of school, HALF DAY. I trusted my son in their care and he came back w a bruise on his face. Usually i would be OK with this kind of injury as they are learning how to walk and are crawling around. But it is the first day of school and he was there for only 3 hours without my supervision. You would think that the teachers will pay more attention to the new infant attending a new school but it does not seem to be the case. I completely understand that accidents can happen but not when it is the first day of school and they are most definitely not short-handed if they are a ratio of 1:3.
7. The school is an air-conditioned facility. After showering they will put the baby in the play area where the FAN is blowing directly at them.
8. My son fall sick 3 times in the less than one month he was there. The first time was runny nose, second and third was back to back stomach flu. He had ongoing runny nose for few weeks. I had to take a lot of AL and CCL due to these. There was no notification from the school of related cases. I believe this is negligence from the school part.
9. The principal is really clueless. The school app does not allow teachers to communicate w the parents directly and only the principal has access to the school communication app. During the first day, when i asked the principal about the access for the school app, she merely said,” er, you should have access w the app cause same as prev school.” She obviously doesnt know what she was talking about. I checked w the admin afterwards.
10. We told the school that we would like to withdraw our son on the third day. However, we have to serve a month notice else our deposit will be forfeited. He cried everyday he attended school. It was heartbreaking.

In view of the above reasons, if they dared behave like this infront of the parent. I wonder how they are like behind closed curtains. (The curtains are always closed)

Wilfred Tay,5,"had to say something after seeing a 1-star review of the IFC, which our daughter is in since when she was only 2+months. She has been with the IFC for 10+ months now.

Overall, we are very pleased to have found this rare gem at such a price point.

WHY?

1. the IFC has its own dedicated space and does not cluster-congregate with PG, N1 & N2. There was a sofa within for teachers to 'rest' and feed the babies.

2. the teachers, mostly mandarin speaking, really care of the babies. will there be accidents? yes, my daughter hit her head a couple of times, but hey, try taking care of 3 babies concurrently. what I appreciate is that the teachers were transparent and share during dismissal without sweeping under the carpet.

3. the principal often pops over and will personally cover any shortfall in manpower / MC. Have seen her doing so a few times. because afterall, everyone knows taking care of babies are not easy because they are more vulnerable.

4. There is regular teacher-parents meet with parents. This tickled us previously because honestly, what is there to update for babies? and also, they already updated us weekly and also biweekly over the app. The principal works on Sunday and send parents the biweekly update on Sunday. if this isn't dedication, I don't know what is.

5. when our baby girl had eczema, the IFC teachers were very willing to help with the cream application because they were truly concerned. They also spent the effort to 'troubleshoot' with us initially on what might be the cause, changing bath lotion and body cream.

6. when my baby was transiting to solids, I was very worried because she had a couple of episodes vomiting in her sleep midnight. The Principal and IFC teachers worked hand-in-glove with us to help tide through this phase, sharing in full details of their meals / ingredients and even calling me personally to address my worries.

Did I ever think of pulling my baby out and changing centres?

Being a first time parent, yes, I did. Because she kept falling sick every 2 ~ 3 weeks initially. but after reading some parents' forum, I realised it is the rite of passage for all babies/children, even for IFCs which charge $2+K per month. Further, babies do develop awareness over time. It is traumatic for babies to change schools and change carers. Hence, I dropped the idea completely. Glad I did.

and yes, I do recommend this IFC as long as it is the same Principal and the same IFC teachers. :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107322582965282125818/reviews
lim angelina,5,"My 13months old child has been in this IFC since 3 months old. What I like about the center is the very low turnover rate. Since my child started school, the core team of full time teachers has not changed at all except for one who had to leave due to medical reason. This helps with establishing consistent routines for my child such as nap routines. And I think having low turnover helps in building relationship with my child, allowing her to feel safe and secure with the familiar adults. This is very evident every morning at drop offs when she is happy to go school, she baobao the teacher spontaneously.

In terms of communication with parents, they used an app but it's to update on the day activities (without picture) of the child (e.g. nap start and end time, milk feed volume, diaper change time). Then every two weeks, the P would send a one page file, usually with two pictures, of what my child has done for the two weeks. In short, dont expect a lot of photo updates. I'm actually very happy with this arrangement because it means the teachers' phone usage time is very low. They can really focus on the children. Anyway they update me every time at pick up and drop off so I think that's good enough for me.

Overall, the P and teachers are very assuring and always work collaboratively with us. Once in a while, the teachers will advise me to work on certain skills which I found really helpful.

Add on:

With regards to feeding, based on my little one’s experience in the school (but please check in with school), before they go on solids, the milk schedule is individualised. We have to key in the app the last feed we gave to our baby before sending to school so that they know what time to give the next feed. In fact there was once I forgot to key and teacher had to call me.

Then when my little one is able to sit well on a chair (usually around 7months), they will be given oats at 10am (replace a milk feed) - you can either choose to eat the one given by school or you provide. Then when she was promoted to mobile side, usually around 10-11months when they can stand, the oats was replaced with porridge and there is also a tea break (most of the time are fruits) at about 3pm.

After one year old, there’s also breakfast at 8am. I find the teachers really understanding because they tried replacing the 8am milk feed with the breakfast provided but my girl kept crying despite consuming a lot of the breakfast. They updated me at pick up on the same day and told me most likely she couldn’t adapt to the change (for breakfast only, she was ok with the rest of the solids at other timings that were introduced much earlier) and suggested to continue to give her a little milk in school and then they will give her a reduced portion of breakfast after that. We agreed, the teachers tried and it worked! So I would say there is flexibility when there is a need to!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112925738793780952200/reviews
Kang Jonathan,5,"Had to share my experience after seeing the 1 star review & feels that somehow things doesn't add up here.

Sent my first child there since he was 4 months old & 2nd child also managed to enroll in the school, both receive lots of love & affection from all teachers.

Communication has always been a breeze with the school teachers & principle, in the initial phase when the app wasn't available yet & also now, with the usage of the app. They will usually give an informal short update when we pick the kids up as well.

The team has always been very transparent with the kids activities, be it good or bad. This gives us the confidence that they are actually bother about the wellbeing & growth of our kids.

Feed scheduling: I left this to the experts as they are trying to establish a feed routine for the kids & in the long term it will make life easier for everyone, parents included, since the kids will want to feed at a fixed timing, making it easier to plan around them.

Injuries: refer to top.. Very transparent about all incidents thus far.
They will call us if it is too serious but hey whats growing up without a few bumps & bruises?

With regards to the kids falling sick while in school, it is a known fact that this will happen no matter which pre-school they are sent to. Probably the only way to skip this is to bubble wrap them in a clean room environment, i guess.

No issue with the communication over the app or what so ever. They have a hotline & whatsapp number for emergency contact, in case you need them for whatever reasons.

Curtians.... Hmm, given the location of the school beside a common walkway from a busstop, I can understand why curtains are needed. Certian level of privacy should be given to the occupants of the school, be it the teachers or the kids.
