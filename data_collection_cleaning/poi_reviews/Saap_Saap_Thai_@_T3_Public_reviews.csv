Paul Ler,5,"Located at the basement of Terminal 3, Saap Saap Thai is an open-concept eateryâ€”not fancy, but clean and fairly spacious. At first, I thought it was part of a food court, especially with the dishwashing area right beside it. This also meant I occasionally caught the smell of Dettol, but it wasnâ€™t overwhelming or off-putting for me.

Ordering is done via a self-service kiosk, which is convenient, though the system can hang at times.

We had the signature chicken boat noodles and the beef boat noodles. The broth was excellentâ€”savoury, refreshing, and not too salty. The noodles were silky, bouncy, and had a nice chewy texture (æœ‰åš¼åŠ²). The meats were fresh, and the meatballs were tasty as well. Overall, we really enjoyed the noodles.

For dessert, we tried the mango sticky rice, which was pretty goodâ€”above average, though not something Iâ€™d call out-of-this-world. The mango wasnâ€™t overly ripe; it had a nice balance of mild sweetness and a hint of sourness. The sticky rice was soft and fully cooked.

As for drinks, the Thai milk tea was a bit disappointingâ€”tasted somewhat artificial with a syrupy, fake tea note. The original Thai iced tea was slightly better than the green tea version, but both were forgettable.

All in all, a solid place to grab a good bowl of noodles and dessert before a flight. Iâ€™d return for the food, just not for the drinks.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100644526789243756650/reviews

M. Chen,4,"An affordable, value for money place to enjoy halal Thai food. There are better tasting Thai food but this one does meet the minimum criteria. Go for their Combo 3 with rice/noodle, drink and mango sticky rice. Very worth it.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117219980570993006062/reviews
Mason Tay,3,"A fast food concept Thai style boat noodles and Thai food. I get a quick fix for my craving for Thai milk tea, Thai glutinous rice, Thai boat noodles and Thai green curry. It is not the best but it has maintained the taste of Thai food. However, why are you hiring all Filipinos that doesnâ€™t act like a thai. Lack of Thai presence and the friendly culture here. Overall the food is still not that bad!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108195777674730720034/reviews
