Siddharth Bhasin,5,"We had a fantastic experience with this program. Our child joined the program for fitness and he developed a love for the game. The coaches are experts, fun, caring, and make it enjoyable for kids. The whole play time is full of fun and laughter while playing some serious football.
Also, a big shout out to the academy team who helped us out with our queries on many occasions. It was a breeze to connect with you.

Yu Jia,5,"We have been having our regular lessons at The Cage, Kallang and they are very enjoyable for our little one. The great thing about this location is that it is sheltered, with natural ventilation, hence lessons are possible during rain or shine. Coaches Kai and Kai Bin are patient with the children, and yet have good control over the pace of the class. Our child has become more sociable and is exposed to different types of sports during the class. Highly recommend VivoKids for parents who wish to engage their children meaningfully.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114589863147612506535/reviews
