After 2nd lesson, my child started to converse with us in Mandarin as much as she can , which is a very positive progress in her learning. Ms Zhang is very engaging and she will always update every student progress after each lesson which is very useful for us parents to understand the learning progress. Improvement proven too.",

      "text": "We had an incredible experience with Teacher Nili & Teacher Zhang.\n\nTeacher Zhang is my daughter’s primary teacher for this year. The lessons are well-structured, and the teaching approach is both engaging and effective. Teacher Zhang is very understanding, patient and most important she is able to get my daughter to no longer shy away and fear of the Chinese language.\n\nWe noticed a progress in my daughter’s listening, reading, and writing abilities. Her grades have also improved.\n\nThe learning environment is always encouraging, and the teacher’s passion for teaching is evident. We highly recommend this tuition to any kids looking to learn or improve their Chinese.",

      "text": "I had one of the teachers as a home tutor and am proud that she has since opened her own tuition centre. My 2nd child is now attending classes at Nili and as she somewhat finds it more challenging to learn the language compared to the other children, the teachers explore different methods to engage her in learning and spark interest in the language.\n\nIt’s evident that the 1 star review here is fake as I never fail to get a response from the teachers after lesson hours. The teachers are also often around after classes to update the parents on the children’s progress and lessons for the day.\n\nHappy to say that my child is improving steadily, if slowly but surely, so please keep up the good work!",
