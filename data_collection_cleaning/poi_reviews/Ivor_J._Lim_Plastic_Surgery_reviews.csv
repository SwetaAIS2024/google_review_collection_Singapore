Isabelle Lim,5,"I vistied Dr. Ivor Lim's clinic recently for a medical concern and really appreciate his help to get me treated in such a short time as I need to travel soon. His expertise and compassionate approach made me feel at ease throughout my entire visit. The clinic staffs(Princy, Hanaka and Julie) are very friendly as well, was patient and thorough in explaining things to me. Would recommend anyone seeking top-notch medical attention.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111072822725668143637/reviews
