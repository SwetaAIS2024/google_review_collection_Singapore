Liang,1,"Visited the clinic while a locum doctor served me. Knowing that I had penicillin allergy as declared in the form, she prescribed me with amoxicillin/clavulanate, a penicillin. It was already dispensed and I left the clinic when I realised she prescribed me a penicillin and went back for a change. Medical negligence by the locum which could have led to serious adverse report.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100573764949775915742/reviews
Tra Nguyen,1,"I never wanted to post an unpleasant review but I can no longer ignore this matter due to its seriousness. I was given an antibiotic course for a treatment of a common bacteria. This is not rocket science. Every doctor knows about the dosage.

But my treatment was heavily under-dose. After the course I went for lab test and found the bacteria was still active. This under-dose treatment has given the bacteria a chance to become resistant. Can you imagine a simple illness becomes incurable because the clinic wants it to be that way? There are only 2 scenarios: either the doctor is incapable or he intentionally doesn’t want to quickly cure the illness. Like I said any undergrad doctor can come up with the correct dosage to treat this bacteria. So I’m thinking something shady is going on. Plus, the doctor recommended that I had a scope to test for the bacteria after his antibiotic course. Of course I didn’t come back. A breath test is sufficient and accurate to diagnose this bacteria and the doctor recommended scope?!

I’m on another course with another doctor but the damage is done. The bateria might have developed resistance to the recommended antibiotics. I can only hope a correct dosage be able to kill the bacteria. But I hope you make the right choice by not committing the same mistake I made.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114638163923155522047/reviews
Jason Chua,1,"Met with a unprofessional male doctor today (think he is a stand-in). When I went into his room, there was an identity card on his desk.  I mentioned to him, and he says none of my problem.  When he started his examination, told me that I am fine but my throat was so swollen and inflamed, he sweeps through my back with his stethoscope before I could even breathe.

Then mention 2 days MC. Which I requested for 1 day.  He still proceed to issue 2 days. Then he talk to the clinic nurse like some entitled old dudes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109625675867424498684/reviews
Jesmine Ng,1,"Won’t be coming to this clinic anymore. For those company panel under this clinic & those who intend/ needs to claim for PA plan, can forget about this clinic. Cos they won’t be issuing itemised receipt (so you won’t know how much is the breakdown amount, e.g. consultation, treatment, medicine prescribed etc) which the insurer required.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113692623107041973373/reviews
Rachel Dowling,5,"Now had my 3rd visit at Bethesda, I can highly recommend them. The receptionist are always helpful and friendly, the wait is never more than 10min for a walk-in appointment, every Dr I have seen has been friendly, helpful and really understood my condition or needs. I have made them my regular clinic.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102216644865825167386/reviews
