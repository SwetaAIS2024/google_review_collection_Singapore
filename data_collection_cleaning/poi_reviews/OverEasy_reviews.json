It was not too crowded but I can imagine that this is a popular place to stop by in the evening. We sat inside as it had just rained but the place offers great outside seating.",

Loved a peaceful and delicious brunch with an amazing view — the burger was cooked to my chosen medium rare perfection, the buttermilk chicken was so crispy and juicy, and the sides complimented everything perfectly with taste and portions. Grabbed seats indoors by the open entrance which make for a great in-between for the indoor comfort but outdoor ambience and view. Prices are a bit too high though I feel, but I suppose that's expected given the location.\n\nOverall a great place that I recommend, I'll definitely be back again!",
